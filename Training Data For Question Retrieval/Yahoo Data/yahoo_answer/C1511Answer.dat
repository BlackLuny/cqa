They often accompany Poseidon and are always friendly and helpful towards sailors fighting perilous storms. They are particularly associated with the Aegean Sea, where they dwelt with their father in the depths within a silvery cave. The most notable of them are Thetis, wife of Peleus and mother of Achilles; Amphitrite, wife of Poseidon; and Galatea, love of the Cyclops Polyphemus.|`|CSysSbnlaa	The rest of the answers are right.. Nereid's were the mermaids of the see who assisted the Water King.  I think I've heard that Nereid's were the ones who gave the Water element people their powers.

6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	It is based on Prophecy that in the End Times, God will pour out His Holy Spirit on His people in what is called the "latter rain". The "former rain" was when Christ's' disciples were all gathered together in the Upper Room, all in one accord, and the Holy Spirit manifested itself as tongues of flame above their heads.  At the End Times, God's church will once again be in "one accord", and will be filled with the Holy Spirit. Right now, the church "sleeps".

3bbtzjBuaa	The point is that a stereotype, by definition, is supposed to (or at least is meant to) apply to an entire group of people, without exception, and even you have admitted that it is wrong to do so.  Furthermore, the creation of a stereotype ironically works against what you are calling for - that people break stereotypes.  This is because stereotypes fix people in a time and a space from which there is no supposed escape - stereotypes, in being absolute, speak to an 'essence' that cannot be shed by those transfixed by a given attribute (whether it be racial makeup or sexual orientation, or even level of education or political affiliation, etc.).<br>  <br>  Stereotypes are rhetorical - they exist as they are spoken of.  "Trends" on the other hand exist, though not in a vacuum (not without some explanation, usually cultural [the culture the subject is from, or the culture they now have to work in]).  A stereotype is created when trends are ascribed to a particular trait (physical, emotional, imagined, etc.) and taken as a given for those people falling under a particular category.  <br>  <br>  When you start talking about "do[ing] something about [stereotypes]" you have to take in a larger picture of what's going on.  That African Americans make up a disproportionate percentage of people in jail (as compared to their percentage in the US population) does not mean that all blacks commit crime anymore than the fact that there are still more white people (in number) in jail means that all whites commit crime.  You have to also look at what is feeding perception - the fact that the justice system is more lenient on whites than on people of color for similar offenses; the ways in which the country has continued to segregate its neighborhoods (post-Jim Crow) and how that's lead to a "good neighborhood" vs. "bad neighborhood" persona that is obviously racial in attitude; or how this segregation feeds into our popular media, which expects bad things to happen in certain places, making it seem normal therein, but obsesses when these things happen in areas we would not expect them to happen.  <br>  <br>  Quite simply, stereotypes take something on the surface, which may apply (or seem to) to a percentage of people in a group, and ascribes it entirely to everyone in that group.  Furthermore, the fact that it's superficially noted means that these pictures are painted without any background knowledge of the ways in which society has largely relegated particular social groups to the bottoms rungs of society, while demanding that everyone pick themselves up by their own bootstraps (in the US at least).  It may seem like no one is doing anything about it, but that's because the hegemonic forces controlling the government (and no it doesn't make a huge difference that the president is black, when there's only one black senator and our system of checks and balances is back in order with the exit of Bush) don't necessarily have to work to improve the situation, especially given the aforementioned statement that individual responsibility somehow completely trumps social conditions/norms.  People have been, and continue to champion equal (civil) rights for all, but you have to convince society and/or the government before radical change can take place...African Americans and other minorities fought for Civil Rights and feminists fought for equal rights among the sexes, but someone arguing for both may not agree with gay rights (and likely due to stereotypical, if not religious reasons).  <br>  <br>  The point is that stereotypes do not further the advancement of a people, especially considering that the people fighting to change conditions are in direct conflict with the stereotype itself when confronting sociopolitical agents (the people or the government they have to convince).  You are simply placing people into bubbles when you stereotype whilst taking away the pin which might otherwise be used as a means of escape.  Then you're blaming the people in the bubble for only having blunt objects to work with...|`|0KR4wyoQaa	So u're saying more than 10% of Arabs and/or Muslims are terrorists?|`|fia9gMHpaa	I am sorry but mexican is not a race.

Its like saying the world is flat. People are MUCH more dimensional than a stupid stereotype.|`|pfNnuD5saa	Stereotypes are ignorant. People are not all alike, they are all unique.|`|l2qtG4yfaa	Because nobody should have to "reach out" to their communnity---people are people and I am not responsible for or should be stereotyped just because someone who has the same skin color did something.<br>  People are people<br>  They have to make their own decisions I shouldn't go and talk to someone just because I am of the same race of someone when I don't even know them.<br>  I want to help my friends and family of all different races, not a random stranger just because he is in my race.<br>  And that is what people overlook.<br>  ____<br>  <br>  And what about other groups too. I mean people are not stereotyped just by race. If everyone reached out to a stranger then that would consume everyone's life.<br>  I mean there are gender stereotypes, religious stereotypes, and stereotypes within every race for certain groups<br>  <br>  Which group should someone reach out to when people fall into many different groups?<br>  That is the problem with stereotypes and generalizations<br>  <br>  It keeps building<br>  <br>  Example of many groups:<br>  Someone can be a Black<br>  American<br>  Female<br>  Christian<br>  Athelete<br>  Southerner<br>  Upper  Class<br>  etc<br>  <br>  There are so many groups and there are many stereotypes within those groups should she go and reach out to all those groups? No.<br>  It would be a never ending process.<br>  Once she reaches out to all the blacks she has to reach out to women, then the Christians, then the Americans, then the Southerners, just to help them "fix" the stereotype.<br>  That is why it is stupid to judge someone by their race|`|CvSKPHiqaa	why should i have to prove that i am an exception though?!<br>  <br>  this whole thing tires me. i take people as they come, and i expect the same treatment.|`|HM2pvjWmaa	I think stereotypes are dumb and don't apply to 90% of the people I know.|`|Ps9eOIchaa	Because stereotypes are far from the truth.People have to remember when making stereotypes about other races,there are always stereotypes about your race,and are you white?Cause if you say they usually are true,there are some stereotypes i'm sure you don't agree with for white guys<br>  <br>  EDIT:Lo siento(:didn't mean to call you white(ignorance on my part)<br>  Well i am who i am,and if people want to stereotype my race,thats ignorance on them,not me.I do prove people wrong though.I'm latino,i'm not a slut,not loud,not pregnant,not a drop out,plan on going to an Ivy League,speak english and spanish fluently.Stereotypes will never go away,they will become more outrageous as time goes on,but all i can do,is prove people wrong by my actions

Thinking you are having premonitions is really perfectly normal paranoia, if you are expect something bad to happen chances are you will look until you find it. I am guessing you are hearing voices due to stress that is normal but since you are experiencing it a lot you should go to a GP. Alleviating the stress will make the 'inner' auditory experiences go away.<br>  <br>   If they go on for long periods of time and are very intense then it is classed a an auditory hallucination. <br>  <br>  People who hear or even see things that are unusual can experience these and not be bothered by them. However if you become detached from reality then this can be a problem, you do not sound as though you have this problem. <br>  <br>  These voices, although you did not realise it and have used superstition to explain it are entirely self generated by your brain.
IddUYNR3aa	Depends on how mature she is. Veterans' homes (not hospitals) and nursing homes and assisted living homes can always use volunteers to write letters, read, or just visit. This can be emotionally draining, but the residents really appreciate it. Humane societies sometimes use volunteers under 16 for helping to bathe puppies and socialize pups and kittens. Summer is the time for fund raising festivals and these are always short of volunteers. Our local library needs over 100 people to serve food, supervise kids' games, sell used books, and a million other things. Is there a park recreation program for little kids that she could help supervise? Is there an office for the aging nearby? Do the elderly need help with gardening?

62364eb8ec72973c388641049ba83389aa	When someone who had a fear of flying urinated themselves during a flight rather than using the toilet, soaked their seat on the plane with urine. On a previous flight before we all boarded the plane.  <br>  <br>  Besides having to smell urine, having listen to an American tourist. Loudly complaining and making a big drama and repeated typical American patriot bragging about suing.

Just be honest and be yourself.<br>  d) It appears so.<br>  e) I see great happiness in your life, not many years from now. But its unclear what the cause is. Perhaps it is marriage to this man.<br>  f) Sometimes you go to a party and feel so out of place you want to just leave, but you put on a happy mask and... it feels like you force yourself to have a good time, even though you don't feel like it. I feel a certain sense of indecision about you, like you second guess yourself and think over past descisions and mistakes you've made. Don't be so hard on yourself, though. There's nothing in your life you should blame yourself for.<br>  g) I don't feel any anger or negative emotions. Just... I actually feel love and sadness. My guess is that he's found someone else he likes, and is still torn between you both. But don't worry, soon he will figure out that its you he wants.<br>  h) I can't say without more detail, I'm afraid. It feels like... ah, there's something there, but its crowded out by conflicting vibrations. I can't make it out.

If you don't have a section like that in your bylaws, then make one.  There are pros and cons to having it - the pro is when someone is this blatantly dumb, you can remove them without needing to wait for an election.  The con is that it opens EVERYONE up to the possibility of being removed from the board for stupid things like personality conflicts and personal politics.
pMFLqU0Yaa	Pagans don't mind sharing so many of their rituals with the christian types. We heathens *do* mind, but only because so many of them lie about what they're doing and why. Either that or they honestly don't know, which is completely inexcusable. In this day and age they could at least educate themselves, but apparently some like to remain ignorant.<br>  <br>  The christian religion is basically an amalgamation of many pagan and heathen faiths with a jewish back story, that's all. <br>  <br>  Oh, and a massive superiority complex combined with a martyr complex and religious intolerance worked in there as their *real* pillars of faith. That's all I can think of that would actually explain the behavior I've witnessed from some of them. "Christ like" doesn't explain it because I don't think he acted like the current batch of followers he's got...<br>  <br>  (though I will admit some are kinda nice)|`|cpOtr6Thaa	First of all, it's a mistake if Christians view all other religions as pagan, but do Christians still do that??  <br>  <br>  Secondly,  there is a big difference between voodoo and what Protestant Christians do (I can't speak for Catholics or other Christian groups).  We pray (to Yahweh), sing, and occasionally  dance (for joy, not to connect with the spirit world).  Christians do not cast spells or believe in magic, sacrifice animals, embody snakes or use them in ceremonies, become inhabited by other spirits ("loa" in Haiti), or believe that god manifests himself through the spirits of dead ancestors.  There are more differences.  <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could look it up and do a bit of research before asking rhetorical questions.|`|566cnzTyaa	Pagan originally meant simply a dweller in a rural community, but since those country people were often the last to be converted, it came to be used by city dwellers as applying to all who did not adopt their professed Christian beliefs. In a similar way the term “heathen” at first meant simply one who lived out on the “heath” or field.|`|xelkbdbdaa	I'm not sure I understand your position. If Christianity is based on paganism, all religions are. After all, the claim has been made that Judaism is pagan by other pagans. So, what does that say about Islam, which is said to be a revelation after both? It appears that all of them are pagan religions. Now, since I believe in this deity of Israel (who I believe presented himself as the man Jesus Christ) , I don't know what that says about me. But, it seems pretty clear that everything is pagan, depending on what one believes.|`|lU285qgSaa	hmmm... Other religions? Must be more specific... Christians do not see Jews as Pagan and they are another religion... Perhaps you are talking about religions which believe in humans with animal heads being GODS or in reincarnation of human souls into rats,cows and ants . <br>  <br>  As the bible stated praying to stone and clay idols was a definate no no if you wanted the One and Only God on your side.<br>  <br>  Then again there is Satanic worship but you would have to believe in Christ and the One God to believe in Satan... <br>  After all he was thrown from heaven to earth by God for being non repentant.<br>  <br>  As far as the Voodoo type rituals I am not sure what you are talking about but you may email me to talk.|`|ZoQOGyqCaa	Christianity was once seen as a Pagan religion by the dominant Roman religion.<br>  <br>  Yeah kitteh, eating flesh and blood and working oneself up into a fervor to talk in jibber jabber tongues ain't nothing like voodoo is it?|`|Jt565VJxaa	Lots of them see all other religions as satanism, weather or not they are as a way to humiliate and insult them.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	not much voodoo in changing bread and wine into a body and blood huh?|`|49VzNZM1aa	Um no we don't.

You need to tell him you no longer wish to marry him because you don't love him and don't like the person he has become. Then tell your parents you have broken the engagement and there will be no marriage.

Such as the main simple fact that you develop your sexuality during puberty. He hasn't had the same experiences as you. Maybe you've faced hate or discrimination for being gay, but he hasn't. Therefore, he doesn't know what it's like. I think when he ignored you, he could've been researching homosexuality, or just basically taking time to think it out. Maybe when you called him, he thought it would be an awkward conversation. Obviously it's not right to ignore a person, but you just have to understand that he probably would like to continue to stay friends with you. Congratulations on coming out by the way. Anyway, I think you should talk to him...just see how he feels about you, and if he really wants to stay friends with you, then stay friends.|`|swkhohjgaa	From the story you tell, in my opinion, you may have been guilty of not being patient enough.  <br>  <br>  We expect everyone to respect and accept that we are different but it sounds like you didn't give him the same chance and respect. <br>  <br>  Its common for people to withdraw for awhile when they need to think. In this case he appears to have been still coming to terms with the fact that you gay and what that meant to your friendship. Maybe he did it the wrong way but there is no formal training how to act and handle these things. Give him and yourself a break.   <br>  <br>  Real friends are rare and harder to find as you get older. Don't loose one over a misunderstanding.

Everytime you ask me that stupid f*cking question I just wanna pull out your hair, strand by strand! You know you're pretty but you just feel the need to hear it every second of every minute of every day because your head needs constant inflation!<br>  If the person is not pretty: By you asking me that question you should already know that YOU'RE NOT! Please stop asking me whether or not you're pretty because one day I might actually work up the courage to tell you the truth and you are going to cry!<br>  <br>  Something like that? :)

X6rFPI2laa	Depending upon what the subject of the invitation might be, leaving out two of four children can be considered extremely rude and hurtful!  If you're leaving two out because they are away at school or out of town, you know they won't come, and it does no harm to say "and family".  In my opinion, it is always better to have two unwanted guests than hurt feelings!  An evening is just an evening, but hurt feelings and the perception of rudeness are not only not forgotten, but also not confined to the family involved -- word spreads faster than you might believe!  Try it and you will find out . . .|`|3becff333a551f4097226dfe2aae0006aa	I'm assuming you're inviting only the two older children because you consider them old enough for an "adult" event.

r7scOGSqaa	I believe in them and am an adult. <br>  There are many myths all around the world of where they came from.<br>  The myths and legends about Faerie are many and diverse, and often contradictory. Only one thing is certain - that nothing is certain. All things are possible in the land of Faerie. <br>  Norse mythology relates how the maggots emerging from the corpse of the giant Ymir transformed themselves into the Light Elves and the Dark elves. light elves, living in the air, are benign, happy creatures, but the dark elves, whose domains are the underground regions, are swarthy, evil and blighting.<br>  The Icelandic version, on the other hand, states that Eve was washing all her children by the river when God spoke to her. In awe and fear she hid those children she had not already washed. God asked if all her children were there and she replied that they were. He then declared that those she had hidden from him would be hidden from man. These hidden children became the elves or faeries and were known as Huldre Folk in the scandinavian countries. Huldre girls are exceptionally beautiful, but with long cowstails; or else they are hollow behind, presenting only a beautiful front. Thus they fulfil the deception of their origin.<br>  Elsewhere faeries are believed to be fallen angels; or  not good enough for Heaven, but not evil enough to find a place in Hell - compelled to live forever 'in between' in the twilight regions, the Middle Kingdom. Moreover it exist, and has existed, in varying forms, in many countries all over the world.<br>  deities that were worshipped before the conversion to Christianity were reduced to the status of fairies in Celtic mythology and folklore.<br>  So in Ireland the gods in the Tuatha De Danann were degenerated to the roles of fairies people living under the dune mound or fabled islands, or even within underwater domains. Similar degeneration occurred with old deities in Wales, Scotland and other surviving pockets of Celtic kingdoms<br>  These earlier Celtic traditions of fairies, the former Irish or Welsh deities were also not fairies in the usual sense. They looked very much like human, in size and shape, except that they have special magical powers and they seemed eternally young, but they don't have wings. The Dananns or their Welsh counterparts were usually seen as race of fair people. They can die just as mortals can, but their lives could last hundreds or even thousands of years.<br>  These medieval fairies are different from the common folklore and fairy tales of today. The Tuatha de Danann is nothing like the brownie, leprechaun and goblin of these later traditions.|`|e5VUwaRsaa	Yep. Just go to the gay section and you will find lots and lots of fairies.|`|meWkZnYnaa	im 10 too and i beleive they exsist . i have no clue from where they come from . well e herd that i suppose they come from nature or something like that . ive heard people say that everything comes from fairies but im not sure about that but anyways ya mabe they come from nature|`|A2nKiMsuaa	I've heard of Sidhe, and I really want to find out more about them and I'm also trying to figure out if there is Sidhe blood in me...

The Bible itself states that John the Baptist was the last prophet:<br>  <br>  Mat 11:13  For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John. <br>  <br>  Luk 16:16  The law and the prophets were until John: since that time the kingdom of God is preached, and every man presseth into it.<br>  <br>  Moreover, Ephesians 2:20 tells us that the church is "built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, with Christ Jesus himself as the cornerstone." Clearly, then, those who claim to be that kind of apostle and/or prophet today have taken upon themselves authority that was not given to them by God.<br>  <br>  The prophetic words of scripture expose today's pretenders. Not only do they fail the Biblical tests given in Deuteronomy 13 and 18, as well as Acts 1:21-22, but "they mouth empty, boastful words and , by appealing to the lustful desires of sinful human nature, they entice people who are just escaping from those who live in errror. The promise freedom, while they themselves are slaves of depravity" (2 Peter 2:18-19).<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 18:21-22  "'How can we know when a message has not been spoken by the Lord?'  If what a prophet proclaims in the name of the Lord does not take place or come true, that is a message the Lord has not spoken. That prophet has spoken presumptuously. Do not be afraid of him."<br>  <br>  TRUE prophets in scripture were NEVER wrong.<br>  <br>  Finally, although it is NOT inspired as scripture, there are NO mainstream Bible Commentators or scholars who believe that prophecy is NOT sealed in this age we live in today.<br>  <br>  That means James Strong, Adam Clarke, John Gill, Matthew Henry, Jamieson, Fausett, and Brown, etc. Who are these men?

The best way to guard yourself against falsehood and false teachers is to know the truth. To spot a counterfeit, study the real thing. Any believer who is “rightly dividing the word of truth” (2 Timothy 2:15), and who makes a careful study of the Bible can identify false doctrine. For example, a believer who has read the activities of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit in Matthew 3:16-17 will immediately question any doctrine that denies the Trinity. Therefore, step one is to study the Bible and judge all teaching by what the Scripture says.<br>  <br>  Jesus said “a tree is recognized by its fruit” (Matthew 12:33). When looking for “fruit,” here are three specific tests to apply to any teacher to determine the accuracy of his or her teaching:<br>  <br>  1) What does this teacher say about Jesus? In Matthew 16:15-16, Jesus asks, “Who do you say I am?” Peter answers, “You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,” and for this answer Peter is called “blessed.” In 2 John 9, we read, “Anyone who runs ahead and does not continue in the teaching of Christ does not have God; whoever continues in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.” In other words, Jesus Christ and His work of redemption is of utmost importance; beware anyone who denies that Jesus is equal with God, who downplays Jesus’ substitutionary death, or who rejects Jesus’ humanity. First John 2:22 says, “Who is the liar? It is the man who denies that Jesus is the Christ. Such a man is the antichrist—he denies the Father and the Son.”<br>  <br>  2) Does this teacher preach the Gospel? The Gospel is defined as the good news concerning Jesus’ death, burial, and resurrection, according to the Scriptures (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). As nice as they sound, the statements “God loves you,” “God wants us to feed the hungry,” and “God wants you to be wealthy” are NOT the complete message of the Gospel. As Paul warns in Galatians 1:7, “Evidently some people are throwing you into confusion and are trying to pervert the gospel of Christ.” No one, not even a great preacher, has the right to change the message that God gave us. “If anybody is preaching to you a gospel other than what you accepted, let him be eternally condemned!” (Galatians 1:9).<br>  <br>  3) Does this teacher exhibit character qualities that glorify the Lord? Speaking of false teachers, Jude 11 says, “They have taken the way of Cain; they have rushed for profit into Balaam’s error; they have been destroyed in Korah’s rebellion.” In other words, a false teacher can be known by his pride (Cain’s rejection of God’s plan), greed (Balaam’s prophesying for money), and rebellion (Korah’s promotion of himself over Moses). Jesus said to beware of such people and that we would know them by their fruits (Matthew 7:15-20). <br>  <br>  For further study, review those books of the Bible that were written specifically to combat false teaching within the church: Galatians, 2 Peter, 2 John, and Jude. It is often difficult to spot a false teacher / false prophet. Satan masquerades as an angel of light (2 Corinthians 11:14), and his ministers masquerade as servants of righteousness (2 Corinthians 11:15). Only by being thoroughly familiar with the truth will we be|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The Bible warns that toward the end of the present age false prophets will arise and try to lure people away from faith in Christ. Jesus said, "Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people" (Matthew 24:11). The Apostle Paul warned that "impostors will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived" (2 Timothy 3:13).<br>  <br>  One of the characteristics of leaders like this is that they claim they, and they alone, have the truth about God. But one way to spot them is to ask what they think of Jesus Christ. They will never agree with what the Bible teaches: He was God's only Son, who came down from heaven and saved us by His death on the cross. Nor will they agree that He was God's final and complete revelation of Himself, and that "in Christ all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form" (Colossians 2:9).<br>  <br>  Don't be deceived by those who reject the Bible or twist its clear meaning, or claim the Bible needs the "wisdom" of some later prophet to make it complete. Instead, put your trust and faith in Christ, for He alone is able to save us, and He alone gives us hope of eternal life. Ask Him to come into your life right now.<br>  <br>  Then ask God to help you find a church where Christ is central and the Bible is taught, so you can be "rooted and built up in him, strengthened in the faith" (Colossians 2:7).|`|vDr5aROwaa	There are false prophets out there in the world right now, but I believe that the Holy Spirit lets you discern which ones are false and which ones are not.|`|6xEpscamaa	This one is easy to figure out.

I say this from a purely reasoning of there never were any prophets from god. But had there been, why would they have been find 2000 years ago, but certainly not today? I agree, anyone claiming to be a prophet today is just as valid as anyone claiming to be a prophet 2000 years ago. There were none from god. Why the double standard...why long ago but not today...makes no sense.  <br>  And if I wanted to be a really good fake prophet, the one thing I would do is study my *** off and make sure that everything I do and say  would gel with what you want. Just like Jesus with the prophecies. All he did theoretically was make up the stuff in order that he was the messiah. <br>  If it had said the messiah will always be wearing a blue hat, you can bet he would have been wearing a blue hat...thus making the prophecy come true.<br>  Or better yet...instead of actually having a man fulfill all the prophecies, just write that he did. <br>  I love when people recite the bible and say, see jesus fulfilled the prophecy. It was a book written a long time ago...how can you be sure what actually happened (if anything at all) and what didnt happen but was just added into it.<br>  <br>  I dont think there is any god...nor were there any prophets, nor will their be any prohets.
hR7OsqtRaa	Jesus responded, “Yes, it is as you say, ‘but I say to all of you: In the future you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven” (Matthew 26:64). <br>  <br>  2Peter 3:3-9"First of all, you must understand that in the last days scoffers will come, scoffing and following their own evil desires. They will say, "Where is this 'coming' he promised? Ever since our fathers died, everything goes on as it has since the beginning of creation." But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.

g4nlUfmeaa	Note: First, I've edited this post a few times.  Second, I am addressing myself to what I feel may be your "best" points, because my goal is to engage your question in good faith, not to beat up on your every fallacy or misconception ... and because I'm only willing to spend so much time on this question.<br>  <br>  ""You don't question Evolution boy! I don't know who is brainwashing you with this nonsense but you are just being delusional. Who has been telling you this nonsense? Evolution is proven, everything else isn't. End of discussion!!!""<br>  <br>  Has anybody in the history of the world actually said this?  Maybe someone has, but probably not anyone with any sort of profile that is or ought to be taken seriously.  On the other hand, very public and influential figures say very similar things about religious matters quite regularly.<br>  <br>  "You see, our skepticism about the current science of the time has propelled our understand of life. There is a new mannerism now. We don't question current science anymore. We accept it with open arms and we fail to discover any other possibilities."<br>  <br>  Skepticism is fine.  But when a predictive theory accumulates as much evidence as evolution (1) (or any other major theory of science -- why is it always evolution, or sometimes the Big Bang that gets singled as the subject of everyone's skepticism?) then you need to do more than point at say something "but that's so complex" to generate a credible doubt about it.  You need actual falsifying evidence or a hypothesis that explains the phenomena we see around us BETTER than evolution.  At Dover (2), the intelligent design advocate Michael Behe (one of the few credentialed life scientists who supports ID/creationists) admitted that a definition of science that would include ID would also include something like astrology -- and ID is the best creationists have been able to come up with in the 150 years since Darwin.<br>  <br>  So question evolution all you want, that's healthy and respectable ... but don't expect your doubts to gain anything approaching equal time in academia until you're able to supply some fresh, contradicting evidence, or until you come up with a competing hypothesis that can one-up the contemporary theory of evolution.<br>  <br>  I don't begrudge people their doubts.  Doubt and skepticism is good and healthy.  People should absolutely be more skeptical; skepticism is the lifeblood of science, as you point out.  I know that I'm not representative of everyone who supports the theory of evolution, but I always try to respond with respect to any genuine questions or doubts a person might have about evolution or any other mater in science -- UNLESS it is clear that the person asking the question is being disingenuous and has made absolutely no effort to inform himself (for example) of what evolutionary biologists actually claim (see: Ray Comfort), or unless they actually vilify science (see: Ben Stein (3)).  Such individuals deserve absolutely no respect, as they're not "questioning" in the true spirit of science and in fact are only trying to undermine it for their own selfish or misguided reasons.<br>  <br>  Humans are not omniscient, so we all have to go through life being ignorant of far more than we will ever know, and so being ignorant is not the most terrible thing, and is not something that you should be held in contempt for -- unless your ignorance is unremitting, and it becomes a tool you wield with pride and arrogance when you advance your ideology.|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	But... it didn't.<br>  <br>  And by the way, of course evolution didn't create EVERYTHING.  There's also cosmology (big bang) and chemistry (abiogenesis).|`|UWKF7x4faa	1) You don't understand evolution.<br>  2) Who made God?|`|GeoiGjbCaa	If you're going to tell shaggy dog stories, you should at least have a punchline of sorts.<br>  <br>  And PLEASE learn the difference between "your" and "you're".|`|AQPmrsVSaa	"So a "magical" unproven theory says that nothing came from nothing and magically created something which magically rearranged itself into self replicating bits which is what made up everything?"<br>  <br>  Theory = hypothesis that is well-supported by empirical evidence and has withstood testing. Treating it as equally plausible as creationism (an untestable hypothesis with zero evidence) tells me that you do not understand the scientific method.<br>  <br>  Evolution never said that nothing came from nothing. It never said something came from nothing either, if that was a typo. And if what you meant was abiogenesis or the Big Bang theory, those also do not say something came from nothing. Try learning something about these theories before claiming to know how valid they are.<br>  <br>  Evolution did not kill science. Evolution, like all theories, is always open to revision. It's been revised and added to a lot since the time of Darwin. All of this has been done through the scientific method you seem to think it ignores. It doesn't.|`|XN0cYCATaa	Consider this<br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century “Caught in the Act”<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdByKKvV6I" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOdByKKvV...</a> (Part 1)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQb7tS-EjM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CQb7tS-E...</a> (Part 2)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN3UfoDZkQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LfN3UfoDZ...</a> (Part 3)<br>  <br>  Creation In The 21st Century -- From Where did these Layers ... <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5Al0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YZyoXQJ5A...</a><br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Overwhelming Evidence 1 of 3 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLdsU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o226umqLd...</a><br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Overwhelming Evidence 2 of 3 <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4O7AOYLqc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d-4O7AOYL...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLFFduC56Y&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXLFFduC5...</a><br>  <br>  Evolution: Against All Odds!<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS9o9cbQDLI" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IS9o9cbQD...</a><br>  <br>  Creation In The 21st Century - Palace of Dinosaurs Part 2 (1 of 3)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeK239U2fdE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SeK239U2f...</a><br>  <br>  Creation in the 21st Century - Explain God<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwP3ZuZq1Y" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NqwP3ZuZq...</a>|`|ni6SCUm9aa	step after that would be ridicule.<br>  "You don't question Evolution boy!

Science and evolution are the same thing. They are both wrong.|`|dz5Og81Qaa	It didn't. Most of your assumptions are false and your prose is rambling.<br>  <br>  For example:<br>  "Before, your parents would tell you that God did it. You would say okay and not say how you feel. In your head you go<br>  <br>  "Oh really? So a "magical" fairytale creature in the sky created everything with his "magical" pixie dust? Are you really this delusional you sheep?""<br>  <br>  This is a total mischaracterization of how a child would react and how a child thinks. Most kids would just believe their parents. The wording of a magical fairy tale creature using pixie dust is an adult atheist turn of phrase as is the delusional sheep label. a child would never think his parent is a delusional sheep (although a teenager might but he/she probably wouldn't ask the question).<br>  <br>  and<br>  "Now today, its a common belief that everything was arisen from evolution. "<br>  <br>  Not true. First, evolution is not a belief. It is a scientific theory w/ literal mountains of evidence to support it. Second, the theory of natural selection aka evolution says nothing about the creation of the planets or how life originated. It only describes how life forms adapt and evolve.<br>  <br>  and<br>  "but some people would go people would go<br>  <br>  "Oh really? So a "magical" unproven theory says that nothing came from nothing and magically created something which magically rearranged itself into self replicating bits which is what made up everything?" ? Are you really this delusional you sheep? Do you know how complicated the cell is? The processes that occur in the cristae within the mitochondria are complex by just that alone?""<br>  <br>  Once again, a child would not say this or think in this way. Natural selection is not a "magical" unproven theory nor does it say nothing came from nothing. You are confounding the common usage of the word "theory" w/ the scientific usage. A person who understands the complexity of cell function would not be asking their parents about where everything came from.<br>  <br>  and<br>  "You see, our skepticism about the current science of the time has propelled our understand of life. There is a new mannerism now. We don't question current science anymore. We accept it with open arms and we fail to discover any other possibilities.<br>  <br>  We now believe that there is possibly no other explanation other than the fact that there is no god. We no longer question current beliefs."<br>  <br>  Wrong, wrong, and wrong. We constantly question current scientific ideas. It's part of the scientific method. Science has no opinion on the existence of a god. It just says we have no evidence. As I stated before, we constantly question and test current scientific theories.<br>  <br>  and<br>  "If we even so much think that there is a designer we are ridiculed as being ignorant of science."<br>  <br>  Wrong again. I believe in God and believe that He is the originator of all that is. I also believe that natural selection is the means He designed to evolve and adapt life forms. I have never once been ridiculed for seeing God as the designer or architect of the universe. Ridicule is generally saved for a literal interpretation of the Bible story of creation.<br>  <br>  Evolution has not killed science. Science and the scientific method are alive and well. So I disagree in spades.|`|5shqstYraa	You seem smart enough to know|`|zrmaX7YCaa	"Look at the trees and birds"<br>  <br>  That was enough to know that your entire treatise is worthless.

This was NDN country, when was the last time you even saw an NDN?   I live and walk on the exact same land my indian ancestors lived and walked on when the europeans showed up.  I own nothing, because it was all stolen.<br>  <br>  So listen to this.  The city I live in wanted to put up a memorial to human rights.  So they spent millions making statues and plaques for  Ann Frank.  In a state where Chief Joseph and his people were hounded and brutalized, where Lewis and Clark were rescued by and befriended by the Nez Pierce only to be rewarded with broken promises and heartless treatment.  The europeans that now own the land my ancestors lived on decide they have to search all the way across the ocean to find an example of human rights abuse.  Such hypocrites.<br>  <br>  Who is treated the best?   Whoever has the money.

8ubAwaGCaa	Notice the phrases like, "And it came to pass," "And the Lord spake unto Moses," and "And the Lord said unto Moses."<br>  <br>  Each of these makes it look like there is a continuation, but it's a literary device used so the speaker doesn't have to cede to another until he's done (or, more likely, it signals to the reader/listener that the topic has not changed).  It's like a run-on sentence on steroids.<br>  <br>   However, they really are breaks in the narrative.  The Lord revealed his instructions to Moses piecewise, giving him time to write them down and take care of other important things in between.  He probably also helped Moses remember what he'd said, unless getting a talking-to from the Lord is an unforgettable experience.|`|BHNlBSf5aa	At one point Moses was before God for forty days on the mountain.

I believe the Holy Scriptures were written as God wanted to communicate with us, therefore Moses who was a very humble man wrote the first five books, and as God cannot lie, as proven in Genesis where He told Adam and Eve, the day you eat thereoff you will die." it became true when satan did lie to them and they ate. So when Christ came as He came from the Father, then Christ also cannot lie but is telling the truth, and Christ knew about satan as He called him the father of lies.|`|oTehE3LIaa	Yes, I used to struggle with that question a lot.  It was horrible, because I just HATED the uncertainty.  (Do you ever feel that way?)

I was a Christian, but I was a Christian with a lot of doubts and a lot of questions.  I really wanted to know for sure that God was real.  And then finally over time I reached the point where I am now (and I'm so grateful for it)!!!  Now I KNOW for SURE that God is real.  God made the world because He is creative and loving.

If there is anything virtuous, lovely, or of good report or praiseworthy, we seek after these things.<br>  <br>  <br>  I should add that there have been many of people who have spent their whole lives studying the Church's doctrine and have ended up expressing at the end of their lives, that, they felt they were just beginning to understand things. <br>  <br>  We are studying God's ways. There is a lot to learn and, with the exception of Jesus Christ, there has never been a person to walk this earth who has been able to learn all about God's ways.|`|78a004f4953e767d0c2c36ffd1bf1c39aa	It would be nice if the Mormons had a simple list of beliefs stated on their website.

For years I denied the existence of God (atheist). I didn't know what I was doing. Used drugs, was borderline alcoholic, partied all the time, you get the idea. However, one night God decided to change all that. I guess he was tired of watching me torture myself. <br>  <br>  To make a long story short Jesus came to me, not the other way around. He gave me visions and thoughts that I never had before. There were books about salvation popping up everywhere, people walking into my life making strong points about christianity, all sorts of weird stuff. Finally, I prayed and instantly, yes instantly I felt peace like I had never felt before. I quit smoking, drugs, alcohol and partying the same day and never looked back.

AA11232725	Do you mean that you can take the Bible as a whole figuratively? Or do you mean that a person can pick which parts they want to take figuratively?<br>  <br>  There is no passage like that. Instead, what we find is Biblical ignoramuses claiming that Christians do that because they haven't taken to time to learn the difference between prophetic and poetic language passages and historical passages. <br>  <br>  They haven't take the time to learn about how God foreshadowed what He was going to do through the Lord Jesus and the coming of the Holy Spirit by having sacrificial and ceremonial laws along with laws that were set forth to portray a spiritual picture of the inward holiness that God would provide under the new covenant via his Holy Spirit.<br>  <br>  Colossians 2:13  And you, being dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, He has made alive together with Him, having forgiven you all trespasses,  14  having wiped out the handwriting of requirements that was against us, which was contrary to us. And He has taken it out of the way, having nailed it to the cross.  15  Having disarmed principalities and powers, He made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in it.  16  So let no one judge you in food or in drink, or regarding a festival or a new moon or sabbaths,  17  which are a shadow of things to come, but the substance is of Christ.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:1  For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.<br>  <br>  Hebrews 10:11  And every priest stands ministering daily and offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.  12  But this Man, after He had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God,  13  from that time waiting till His enemies are made His footstool.  14  For by one offering He has perfected forever those who are being sanctified.  15  But the Holy Spirit also witnesses to us; for after He had said before,  <br>  <br>  16  "THIS IS THE COVENANT THAT I WILL MAKE WITH THEM AFTER THOSE DAYS, SAYS THE LORD: I WILL PUT MY LAWS INTO THEIR HEARTS, AND IN THEIR MINDS I WILL WRITE THEM,"  <br>  <br>  17  then He adds, "THEIR SINS AND THEIR LAWLESS DEEDS I WILL REMEMBER NO MORE."  18  Now where there is remission of these, there is no longer an offering for sin.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	When it says its a parable.......>|`|jg5Ii27Vaa	you either believe it or you dont.

tpDICzslaa	The Bible doesn't say that ghosts don't exist - in fact Matt 14:27 shows that the disciples believed in ghosts and (mistakenly) thought that they had seen one. There is also the example of Samuels ghost, summoned by the witch of Endor (1 Sam 28:8 ff). It is quite clear from the story that this is Samuel himself, and not just some demon pretending to be him.<br>  <br>  So in answer to your question yes, Christians can believe in ghosts. My personal view is that the majority of ghosts are manifestations of souls in purgatory who have been permitted (or compelled?) to appear, to seek whatever prayer or spiritual help they require. There may also be some 'ghosts' (in a looser sense of the word) which are apparitions of the saved (cf Matt 27:52, Mark 9:4, Luke 16:27-31, etc) who are allowed to appear either as a sign, or to give some particular message.|`|wK85ZvOMaa	Oh the bible does say they exist.

It has made me more accepting to the plight of my fellow human beings.  We are all here to learn whatever lessons we willingly came here to learn.  We cannot judge another by the path they are following, whether we perceive it as positive or negative, it is not for us to judge.  We are all here to learn the same things.  It has brought me to the understanding that we are all Holy Spirits of the One Great Spirit, and we are ALL equal in the eyes of God.  To judge another is to find fault in ourselves.  The most important thing we can do is help our fellow man along the path, whichever path that may be, they all lead to God and enlightenment.  The drunk on the street might be a lesson for us in compassion.  There are teachers for us in every walk of life.  To see only Love in everyone is the true way to enlightenment.

The war in heaven we lost and were cast out and as Jesus my redeemer was planted into the womb of a woman so are we. Jesus says that He knows us before we were born and I believe that this and other scriptures prove that we were before we were born. We spent countless years millions upon millions billions upon billions of years in the paradise in Heaven. We were betrayed by Satan into thinking that He was a God and we wanted to worship Him. There is only one true God and He says that He will show us mercy and let us see what Satan’s world would be like and give us a chance to serve God of our own free will or be destroyed by Fire as the Lord God Almighty purifies His Universe.|`|yMVdKHhmaa	I was not aware the Mayan had predicted this. there does seem to be an awaking going on. somethings changing and lets face it, it has to. we are entering an era where we have to evolve spiritually if we are going to survive, otherwise millions will die as we squabble over resources|`|1KcQbEopaa	Baffling.

So I assume you are asking for evidence of our faith and not proof?  I have faith that God, the Creator, exists.  My evidence is the apparent impossibility of a naturalistic explanation of the origin of life and the universe.|`|35Mer9LJaa	The literal definition of the words fear and faith are the same and those words can be substitute for the word believe/belief.  So faith is what you believe in with or without evidence.<br>  <br>  I believe that we all have an innate ability to discern. For instance your girlfriend says everything is fine and you have no proof that it's not,  but you have no doubt that she's lying and something is very wrong and you are probably right. <br>  <br>  And if your talking about God we have the Holy Spirit to help and warn us.   And if you are talking about God or the existence of Jesus - there is a disgusting amount of proof, there are only 300 surviving records of Socrates writings who died before Jesus was ever born and there are over 26,900 original records of the bible some of which were not found until the 70's and they match perfectly with the bible we have today and if that wasn't enough the original priests and disciples wrote letters to each other during the time of Jesus and shortly thereafter and we could reconstruct over 90% of the bible just based on the scripture they quoted back and forth to each other.|`|AA11952133	Hebrews 11:1  Faith is the assured expectation of things hoped for, the evident demonstration of realities though not beheld.|`|3rdXOSLVaa	Faith is belief without proof.

I'm assuming you mean faith in God or a particular way of following religion but there's a lot of life that operates outside of religious or spiritualist beliefs that involves faith.  I have faith that the sun will rise tomorrow.  Where's my proof?  Well, it's happened every day of my life and (from what I've been told) for many years before that.  I have faith it will rise tomorrow based upon past experience.  Maybe I'll be wrong but at that point, being wrong will be the least of my concerns.<br>  Faith in God or religion is often supported with proof that believers will accept but non-believers won't---they might talk about the Bible or other religious texts that aren't important to non-believers but are proof to believers.  Is it hogwash?  Sure, to some people.  But to believers is proof enough to justify their faith.  Narrowly missed an accident while driving?  Some might call that being protected by guardian angels; others will call it lucky or just the way things happened.|`|cb33f3fcc98eaafaba8a84afddd2bca0aa	There has to be proof or one would not have faith. The proof is in His Word that controls your heart, because the Spirit of God lives from within.<br>  <br>  You must pray for understanding and become rooted in His word, if not then Satan will snatch you back when the trials and persecution began.<br>  <br>  You will have trials and persecutions in order to become grounded in His word. Persecutions produces endurance and endurance produces character. <br>  <br>  Once you become rooted in His word Satan can't snatch you back, Why?

I thought I was the only one.  well I always thought that Mexican people and the few native americans I've seen looked asian and then I learned from my anthropology class that they are asian because native americans are originally from asia and they migrated to the americas.    <br>  <br>  and to ur second question: I don't think so because Italians do not have asian blood like a n.a/white mixed person.  Also hispanics have white ancestors and they don't look anything like Italians, who are generally lighter than hispanics.|`|26e0b0c65ed49aa633c795f53d072963aa	If you read more about history,you'll discover that there was a mass emigration of Asians who crossed the Alaska strait.once they reached the Americas,they started moving to places as far as Argentina.I'm not one hundred percent sure but I think Native Americans evolved from this emigration of Asians.|`|5296c209e5110b6da055a14f5c7d7af8aa	Many probably do because they are descents of Asia.  It is believed that when the the continents were connected, these indigenous people would walk across these great spans and when the continents separated many were "stuck" here.<br>  <br>  As for what your offspring will look like, I'd say it depends on the strength of the gene pool, but more than likely they will look a little like their mother and a little like their father.|`|zTuc5eDIaa	That's because they originally migrated from Asia to the Americas across the Bering Straight thousands of years ago.<br>  <br>  There are three basic races: caucasoid (white), mongoloid (Asian/Native American), and négroid (black).

Thinking from the other viewpoint, what would we experience when we are dead? Will it be just like falling asleep, but switching off forever? Or will we, as spirit, find ourself floating in the vicinity of our body (or elsewhere), rethinking our entire life-philosophy?<br>  <br>  The first case is inconsequential to our discussion (though it may be true). I mean, there is nothing more to discuss. Switched off, that's it. "Our Self", the consciousness, disappears. Our body is recycled by nature and it's remnant atoms, molecules reconstitute as something/somebody else.<br>  <br>  The second case presents interesting spiritual possibilities. If we find ourself as spirit floating around. What happens now? Does our spirit travel to some other world or heaven, where it lives another lifetime/forever? Or does it enter into some other body, waiting in a womb?? What happens with the memories of the previous lifetime? Are those memories wiped off? How? By whom? Our previous Karma determines which new body we will take? Who designed this system of Karma? Who micromanages it? All of which lead to the larger spiritual questions.<br>  <br>  So, what is my personal view? I think it's the second case. Of experiencing things as a spirit/soul. But how do we see, hear stuff at that time or admire the beauty of a heaven if we have given up our body with all it's organs of sight, sound, etc?? I believe that even when we are alive, in the present, it is not our eyes, ears, etc. which do the hearing, seeing for us. The reality we see around everyday when we are alive is something which is projected upon / experienced by our soul (not by our organs). It is kind of an imaginary or rather virtual reality, which our soul experiences. And Post-Death experience is just a continuation of that virtual reality projected on the soul. Except, it is in different settings and without the pretense of sense organs. Or maybe even with it.|`|EAuMJrs4aa	after death your body rots or your ashes are spread somewhere|`|hR7OsqtRaa	You will be judged by Jesus, based on the teachings of the Bible and what you do and say on Earth.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

I'm always interested to find out what different people believe about the afterlife.  I am a Christian, and as you predicted, I believe in a Heaven and a Hell.  But I don't believe that if you're good you go to Heaven and if you're bad you go to Hell.  We all have done our fair share of things to mess up our lives...or at least I have =)  I don't think any of us are good enough for Heaven--that all of us have lied, or stolen something, or messed things up for ourselves in some way.  We have all fallen short of God's standard, fallen short of Heaven.  But Jesus loves us so incredibly, He even came to earth and lived, and then died on the cross for us, taking on the punishment for us, in our place.

We won't be in a state of dreamlike consciousness, but we will fully exist in body, mind and soul.<br>  <br>  The pattern for this is Jesus Himself. When Jesus died on the cross and was laid in a tomb, His physical body was completely and absolutely dead. But He came back to life by the power of God—and when He did, He had a different type of body, without the limitations it once had. His resurrected body wasn't an illusion; it was a glorious and immortal body that was just as real as His earthly body had been.<br>  <br>  And someday, if we know Christ, we too will be given new bodies—bodies like Christ's resurrected body. The Bible says, "So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable" (1 Corinthians 15:42). Our bodies in heaven will be real, and so will our whole existence. Only in this way will we be able to serve God.<br>  <br>  But the real question is this: Are you ready for that day? Do you know—really know—that if you were to die tonight, you would go to be with Christ in heaven forever? You can know, by confessing your sins and your need of Christ, and trusting Him alone for your salvation.

God forgives us by punishing Jesus for our sins, thus if I'm a believer it means Christ was the perfect substitute for my sins and suffered the wrath of God equivalent to me suffering an eternity in damnation.  <br>  <br>  If an angel is to be saved there has to be a perfect angelic substitute for their transgression and that substitute must be punished in order for the other one to go free.|`|DDwecKakaa	If you read closely God is Satan. If he exists at all then this is the case. Or satan is really trying to save humans from God. God has done more EVIL by his own"word" than Satan by god accusations. When jesus was accused of commanding demons because he was Satan he said that Satan would not work against himself, yet in the bible it clearly says that god brought an evil Spirit on Saul. so since God commands evils Spirit to come onto man, and jesus commands them out. Perhaps Jesus in Satan incarnate to protect us from God.|`|iXI7n6Gmaa	Yes,<br>  <br>  But all people have to forgive him too.<br>  <br>  Otherwise he has to pay for all the mischief he had helped, encouraged, and/or caused.|`|5shqstYraa	Yes, but Satan wont apologize|`|jG0p29Ffaa	Already happened.|`|4a90504957aff9034b64718e68e26f48aa	it is said that if you  confess and repent you are forgiven. why would it be any diff with him. besides most say satan was Gods fave angel..|`|mFcEKNUUaa	Probably, since there wouldn't be any more evil.

jOZWekKjaa	Adler, Margot: Drawing Down the Moon <br>  If you want to learn about birds, you get a field guide about birds. If you want to learn about mushrooms, you get a field guide to mushrooms. Drawing Down the Moon is a field guide to Pagans. Rather than offering up a book of spells and recipes, Margot Adler presents an academic work that evaluates modern Pagan religions - including Wicca - and the people who practice them. The work is based on a survey the author took over two decades ago, but the information within is still a worthy read. Drawing Down the Moon makes no apologies for the fact that not all Wiccans are full of white light and fluff, but instead tells it like it is. Adler's style is entertaining and informative, and it's a bit like reading a really well-done thesis paper.<br>  <br>  <br>  Buckland, Raymond: Complete Book of Witchcraft<br>  <br>  Raymond Buckland is one of Wicca's most prolific writers, and his work Complete Book of Witchcraft continues to remain popular two decades after it was first published - and for good reason. Although this book represents a more eclectic flavor of Wicca rather than a particular tradition, it's presented in a workbook-like format that allows new seekers to work through the exercises at their own pace, learning as they go. For more seasoned readers, there's a lot of useful information as far as rituals, tools, and magic itself. This book is a classic, and well worth picking up.<br>  <br>  <br>  Cunningham, Scott: Wicca - A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner<br>  The late Scott Cunningham wrote a number of books before his untimely death, but Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner remains one of the best known and most useful. Although the tradition of witchcraft in this book is more Cunningham's eclectic path than any other tradition, it's full of information on how to get started in your practice of Wicca and magic. He goes into depth about tools, how and why they are used, ethics, and the concept of god and goddess. If you're interested in learning and practicing as an individual, and not necessarily jumping into a coven right off the bat, this book is a valuable resource.<br>  <br>  Curott, Phyllis: Witch Crafting<br>  Phyllis Curott is one of those people who makes me glad to be Pagan -- because she's really normal. An attorney who has spent her life working on First Amendment issues, Curott has managed to put together a really useful book. Witch Crafting is not a collection of spells, rituals or prayers. It's a hard and fast look at magical ethics, the polarity of male and female in the divine, finding the god and goddess in your everyday life, and the pros and cons of coven life vs. solitary paths. Curott also offers up a very interesting take on the Rule of Three. Whether you're a new student of Wicca, or a veteran, Witch Crafting is worth reading more than once.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eilers, Dana: Pagans and the Law - Understand Your Rights<br>  <br>  Eilers spent many years facilitating an event called Conversations With Pagans, and from that she wrote a book entitled The Practical Pagan. She then drew on her experience as an attorney to write Pagans and the Law: Understand Your Rights. This book goes into depth about precedents in religious discrimination lawsuits, how to protect yourself if you may be a victim of workplace harassment, and how to document everything if your spirituality is leading someone to treat you unfairly. Eilers is an outspoken woman who has a lot of great advice worth listening to.<br>  <br>  <br>  Farrar, Janet & Stewart: The Witches' Bible<br>  [p]The first section of this book is Eight Sabbats for Witches. It goes into depth on Sabbat rites, and the meanings behind the holidays are expanded on. While the ceremonies in The Witches' Bible are the Farrars' own, there's a heavy influence of the Gardnerian tradition, as well as Celtic folklore and some other European history. The second half of the book is in fact another book, The Witches Way, which looks at the beliefs, ethics, and practice of modern witchcraft. Despite the fact that the authors are a bit conservative by today's standards, this book is an excellent look at the transitioning concept of what exactly it is that makes someone a witch. <br>  <br>  Gardner, Gerald: Witchcraft Today<br>  <br>  Image courtesy of BK TignerGerald Gardner is the founder of modern Wicca as we know it, and of course of the Gardnerian tradition. His book Witchcraft Today is a worthy read, however, for seekers on any Pagan path. He discusses paganism in Europe, as well as the so-called "witch cult", and goes on to demonstrate how many of history's notable names are connected, one way or another, to what we know today as witchcraft. Although some of the statements in Witchcraft Today should be taken with a grain of salt -- after all, Gardner was a folklorist and that shines through in his writing -- it's still one of the foundations that contemporary Wicca is based on. For its historical value, few things beat this book.<br>  <br>  Here's a few|`|U9JWut4Oaa	I'm an atheist, so I don't know much, but I have it on good authority from my Wiccan friend that anything written by Scott Cunningham is idealy what you should be reading.<br>  <br>  I will ring your doorbell and run away!!!

The technology is available and people are already being "chipped".  Scripture says the church will be raptured before the Antichrist can rise to full power and the mark is supposed to be required in  the second half of the tribulation.  BUT God was very very specific about the location of the chips and the danger of accepting them.  The question to all believers is-- Are you willing to take the risk of your eternal soul by thinking this is not what God warned us about?  Or are you willing to trust God to take care of you if you refuse to allow the chip to be implanted and cannot work or shop for food and if necessary - Die for your faith in Jesus Christ?<br>  I for one will not allow myself to be chipped I am willing to die for Jesus Christ.  God bless you!|`|fOfJz9OMaa	For me, the mark of the beast is the scanning system of either with the right hand or with the eye which is the forehead.|`|cb33f3fcc98eaafaba8a84afddd2bca0aa	YES...I read this twice and agree with you up to: We will be forgiven for our sins on earth this is how we get to Heaven.

But he is the god of this world and all of its sins.<br>  <br>  Apparently you have given this much thought and you are correct to say, the #666 the number for Satan, will come from the electronic device, known as the computer chip.<br>  It will control everything, but why fear. If you belong to the Lord you are guided by Love not Fear! If not then one would have a need for worry, the horror never stops!<br>  <br>  Folks, this day is nearer than you think!@!.|`|kX0T1urdaa	When they go from cards to implanting chips in the head or hand those are the marks that will condemn a person. <br>  <br>  Those who are already believers will be gone before that happens. Those who determine to stand for Christ during the time the Anti Christ is ruling will have to refuse to let that chip be put in. This will probably be why so many are beheaded. Better that than go to hell forever.<br>  <br>  Sounds harsh but this is why it is so important for people to be saved NOW so they won't have to go through all that.<br>  <br>  You are talking about the laws of binding and loosing which has nothing to do with your sins being forgiven. Whatever we bind on earth is bound in heaven and so on. You have to be a Christian to have that power. <br>  <br>  The chips you are talking about shows that the technology is in place for the Anti Christ to chip people the same way animals are now. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.armageddonangelsufos.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.armageddonangelsufos.com</a>|`|9oWzVEToaa	I absolutely believe they are!|`|NOipQnIsaa	I don't knnow anything about Romanian law, but I'll bet you a quarter that there is no law of this kind in your country.  It would take thousands of people to impliment it and then they would still have a job on their hands updating it every time you spent a few dollars.  They would have to adjust your bank account continually, among other subjective things. As far as the 666 business is concerned, Bible scholars agree that was a code for the name Nero.  Blaming Nero for anything at the time would and could get you killed.  Since then they further  proven that it is not 666, but 616.  Now where does that put us?  Hmmmmm.<br>  Don't get your undies in a wad over myths.  That would be the whole Bible.|`|aHMGV046aa	Biometric chips contain the number 666, making them an instrument of evil...i believe they are very bad and steel our freedom.<br>  Before anything, let’s look a bit over the history of biometric passports. They were introduced in 2004 in the US hoping to develop better border security when combined with a large information database to allow quick verification for those entering or exiting US. It works by using a RFID chip (radio-frequency identification) that allows information to be transfered from an EEPROM chip (a type of read-only memory) to a remote reader. Basically, the owner would be identified and his credentials checked inside in airport without having to trouble him to show the id, go in a room for fingerprinting, etc … you just walk and if you’re not in a criminal database, you just go on doing your stuff normally.<br>  Sound great? It’s not. The problem is just that: your data can be read remotely. Theoretically nothing can stop a bad man from building a reader which he can use to walk down the street and just get information from random people (or targeted people). Also, the EEPROM isn’t all that read-only, after all if a company can get a EEPROM writer to put information into those chips, there’s really nothing that can prevent an individual from getting one to make his own chips. Put one and one together and you can see that cloning these passports isn’t all that much trouble.

This is true.<br>  <br>  Any other logic forces you to conclude the world is completely absurd.<br>  <br>  Now... the question of god... well that is another thing altogether.|`|AA11849917	As one author once stated, "There are two absolutes:  Truth IS, and it can be known."<br>  <br>  One person told a friend of mine that he didn't believe in any absolutes.  He said (and I quote), "There are no absolutes!"  My friend asked him, "Are you absolutely sure about that?"<br>  <br>  Jesus said "I am Truth." Was Jesus telling the truth when He said that? Or was He a liar?<br>  <br>  Jesus said that the only way you can know God is through Him. <br>  <br>  Jesus said that He did ONLY what He saw His Father in heaven do. (No man has seen God at any time, yet Jesus SEES God and copies His behaviors, so Jesus must be something MORE than a mere man, since no MAN has seen God.) He KNEW God. He even said that He came from the very HEART of God, so He could say objectively, "When you've seen ME, you've seen the Father."<br>  <br>  Jesus also said "I am Life", and again, "I am the bread of Life that has come down from My Father in heaven to give Life.", and again, "I am the water of life. Whoever is thirsty, come to me, and out of his inner-most being shall flow rivers of living waters", and finally, "I am the Resurrection and the Life. If any man believe in me, though he may die, yet shall he live again."<br>  <br>  He said, "You already believe in God, now believe in me."<br>  <br>  In his famous book Mere Christianity, C. S. Lewis makes the following observation: "A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic - on the level with a man who says he is a poached egg - or he would be the devil of hell. You must take your choice. Either this was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God.

Here is the bible's view on the soul:<br>  <br>  “SOUL” AS USED IN THE BIBLE<br>  First, consider the soul. You may remember that the Bible was originally written mainly in Hebrew and Greek. When writing about the soul, the Bible writers used the Hebrew word ne′phesh or the Greek word psy·khe′. These two words occur well over 800 times in the Scriptures, and the New World Translation consistently renders them “soul.” When you examine the way “soul” or “souls” is used in the Bible, it becomes evident that this word basically refers to (1)?people, (2)?animals, or (3)?the life that a person or an animal enjoys. Let us consider some scriptures that present these three different senses.<br>  People. “In Noah’s days .?.?. a few people, that is, eight souls, were carried safely through the water.” (1?Peter 3:20) Here the word “souls” clearly stands for people—Noah, his wife, his three sons, and their wives. Exodus 16:16 mentions instructions given to the Israelites regarding the gathering of manna. They were told: “Pick up some of it .?.?. according to the number of the souls that each of you has in his tent.” So the amount of manna that was gathered was based upon the number of people in each family. Some other Biblical examples of the application of “soul” or “souls” to a person or to people are found at Genesis 46:18; Joshua 11:11; Acts 27:37; and Romans 13:1.<br>  Animals. In the Bible’s creation account, we read: “God went on to say: ‘Let the waters swarm forth a swarm of living souls and let flying creatures fly over the earth upon the face of the expanse of the heavens.’ And God went on to say: ‘Let the earth put forth living souls according to their kinds, domestic animal and moving animal and wild beast of the earth according to its kind.’ And it came to be so.” (Genesis 1:20,?24) In this passage, fish, domestic animals, and wild beasts are all referred to by the same word—“souls.” Birds and other animals are called souls at Genesis 9:10; Leviticus 11:46; and Numbers?31:28.<br>  Life as a person. Sometimes the word “soul” means one’s life as a person. Jehovah told Moses: “All the men who were hunting for your soul are dead.” (Exodus 4:19) What were Moses’ enemies hunting for? They were seeking to take Moses’ life. Earlier, while Rachel was giving birth to her son Benjamin, “her soul was going out (because she died).” (Genesis 35:16-19) At that moment, Rachel lost her life. Consider also Jesus’ words: “I am the fine shepherd; the fine shepherd surrenders his soul in behalf of the sheep.” (John 10:11) Jesus gave his soul, or life, in behalf of mankind. In these Bible passages, the word “soul” clearly refers to life as a person. You will find more examples of this sense of “soul” at 1?Kings 17:17-23; Matthew 10:39; John 15:13; and Acts 20:10.<br>  A further study of God’s Word will show you that nowhere in the entire Bible are the terms “immortal” or “everlasting” linked with the word “soul.” Instead, the Scriptures state that a soul is mortal, meaning that it dies. (Ezekiel 18:4,?20) Therefore, the Bible calls someone who has died simply a “dead soul.”—Leviticus 21:11.|`|2bC0dvPKaa	No - Our minds are only human, and not built to last.

Whenever the word "spirit" is used, it refers to the immaterial part of man including his soul.|`|QCejFqXgaa	Peace and Blessings......<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  We have come to the conclusion after much investigation of the Word of God that unless the believer has an understanding of man's soul he is hopelessly entangled in error and is ever at the mercy of the doctrines of men.<br>  <br>  Before the time of Christ one of the early philosophers believed and taught that man had an immortal "soul." He referred to it as that part of man which will live on forever in some other place and in a different form. He taught that it was about the size of the human fist and at death it, being invisible, popped out of the bosom of man. It then went to its final reward. It, the human soul, lived on in another world. Other philosophers refined this and even added other dimensions to the teaching. Some began to teach that based upon your life here you earned the right to go to a place of eternal bliss or you forfeited this right by your conduct. Two places were imagined. One was a place of bliss based upon the goodness of the individual. Another was a place of torment based upon the wickedness of the individual. But whatever the philosophers imagined about man and his destiny turns out to be the imaginations of a darkened understanding.<br>  <br>  Those who have studied the doctrines of the philosophers will recognize the influence they have had upon Christianity. Those who also have looked at other religions will recognize that in the main they subscribe to the doctrine of the soul that fits in with the imaginations of the philosophers. Until we as Bible believers allow the Word of God to speak to our hearts we are at the mercy of the unenlightened. The Bible is very emphatic about the "soul." It is not a deep theological subject. It is very clear and plain. If the Bible would be opened and the first thirty-six verses read you would come to the Divine explanation of the soul.<br>  <br>  "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life: and man became a living soul" (Gen. 2:7).<br>  <br>  Even a casual look at the verse reveals That the Bible speaks of two things making a whole. "Formed man of the dust of the ground" - as a potter would form a vase with his hands out of clay, so God formed man out of the dust of the earth. The word "form" implies the shape, that is, his bodily shape or form. Isaiah 64:8 says. "But now, O Lord. Thou art our Father; we are the clay. and Thou our Potter: and we all are the work of Thy hand."<br>  <br>  The form of man was simply his body. It ,vas lifeless until God breathed into his nostrils the breath of life.<br>  <br>  ". . . as the body without the spirit (i.e. the breath of life) is dead. . . "(James 2:26).<br>  <br>  The body of man was formed and it was lifeless. We read in Ezekiel Chapter 37 that the dry bones of Israel will live again. We learn that the dry bones will have sinews and flesh put upon them, and then skin will cover the bones, and then God will put breath in them, "and (they) shall live."<br>  <br>  "And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life" - notice that it was the breath of life that caused man to live. The body was formed but it was lifeless. God caused breath to enter into the nostrils of Adam and he lived. When the breath of life was to be withdrawn God told Adam that he would return "unto the ground; for out of it wast thou taken: for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return" (Gen. 3:19). There is no mention of immortality here at all. Before Adam was created he did not exist. When God created him and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life Adam became a living soul. He was not one before that, and when he died and returned unto the ground from which he came he did not continue being a living soul. The breath of life was not immortal; it was temporary. It simply sustained life for awhile. The "tree of life" was placed in the Garden of God and its purpose was to produce the fruit that Adam could eat in order for him to "live forever" (Gen. 3:22).<br>  <br>  After Adam sinned he was barred from the "tree of life." All he had was the breath of life. When God would withdraw the breath of life Adam would die. After sin entered in and death by sin, in order for Adam to live forever he would now have to die, and then live again later in resurrection.<br>  <br>  The Bible speaks a great deal about the soul. This paper is only to set forth the basic premise of the "soul." Space does not allow more than that. The interested student can develop a study with a good concordance as he checks out every reference in the Bible to "soul." Remembering that God formed man from the ground, then breathed into his nostrils - thus man became a living soul. This tells us plainly that man is not a three-part being but rather a two-part being. The body of man equals "dust of the ground," the spirit equals "the breath of life." Therefore the equation, "the whole is equal to the sum of all its parts" can be applied to man. He is a body with a spirit, hence he is a living soul. Man is not a body, a spirit and a soul, bu|`|AA11124121	It was this experiment which was the most famous.

Men with a poor fund of knowledge and men who are not austere cannot understand the wonders of the individual atomic spark of spirit, even though it is explained by the greatest authority of knowledge, who imparted lessons even to Brahma, the first living being in the universe. Owing to a gross material conception of things, most men in this age cannot imagine how such a small particle can become both so great and so small. So men look at the soul proper as wonderful either by constitution or by description. Illusioned by the material energy, people are so engrossed in subject matter for sense gratification that they have very little time to understand the question of self-understanding, even though it is a fact that without this self-understanding all activities result in ultimate defeat in the struggle for existence. Perhaps one has no idea that one must think of the soul, and also make a solution of the material miseries.<br>     Some people who are inclined to hear about the soul may be attending lectures, in good association, but sometimes, owing to ignorance, they are misguided by acceptance of the Supersoul and the atomic soul as one without distinction of magnitude. It is very difficult to find a man who perfectly understands the position of the soul, the Supersoul, the atomic soul, their respective functions, relationships and all other major and minor details. And it is still more difficult to find a man who has actually derived full benefit from knowledge of the soul, and who is able to describe the position of the soul in different aspects. But if, somehow or other, one is able to understand the subject matter of the soul, then one's life is successful. The easiest process for understanding the subject matter of self, however, is to accept the statements of the Bhagavad-gita spoken by the greatest authority, Lord Krsna, without being deviated by other theories. But it also requires a great deal of penance and sacrifice, either in this life or in the previous ones, before one is able to accept Krsna as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Krsna can, however, be known as such by the causeless mercy of the pure devotee and by no other way.<br>  <br>  Bg 2.17 P         Contents of the Gita Summarized<br>     This verse more clearly explains the real nature of the soul, which is spread all over the body. Anyone can understand what is spread all over the body: it is consciousness. Everyone is conscious of the pains and pleasures of the body in part or as a whole. This spreading of consciousness is limited within one's own body. The pains and pleasures of one body are unknown to another. Therefore, each and every body is the embodiment of an individual soul, and the symptom of the soul's presence is perceived as individual consciousness. This soul is described as one ten-thousandth part of the upper portion of the hair point in size. The Svetasvatara Upanisad confirms this:<br>  <br>    balagra-sata-bhagasya satadha kalpitasya ca<br>    bhago jivah sa vijneyah sa canantyaya kalpate<br>  <br>     "When the upper point of a hair is divided into one hundred parts and again each of such parts is further divided into one hundred parts, each such part is the measurement of the dimension of the spirit soul." (Svet. 5.9) Similarly, in the Bhagavatam the same version is stated:<br>  <br>    kesagra-sata-bhagasya satamsah sadrsatmakah<br>    jivah suksma-svarupo 'yam sankhyatito hi cit-kanah<br>  <br>     "There are innumerable particles of spiritual atoms, which are measured as one ten-thousandth of the upper portion of the hair."<br>  <br>     Therefore, the individual particle of spirit soul is a spiritual atom smaller than the material atoms, and such atoms are innumerable. This very small spiritual spark is the basic principle of the material body, and the influence of such a spiritual spark is spread all over the body as the influence of the active principle of some medicine spreads throughout the body. This current of the spirit soul is felt all over the body as consciousness, and that is the proof of the presence of the soul. Any layman can understand that the material body minus consciousness is a dead body, and this consciousness cannot be revived in the body by any means of material administration. Therefore, consciousness is not due to any amount of material combination, but to the spirit soul. In the Mundaka Upanisad the measurement of the atomic spirit soul is further explained:<br>  <br>                    eso 'nur atma cetasa veditavyo<br>                   yasmin pranah pancadha samvivesa<br>                 pranais cittam sarvam otam prajanam<br>                  yasmin visuddhe vibhavaty esa atma<br>  <br>     "The soul is atomic in size and can be perceived by perfect intelligence. This atomic soul is floating in the five kinds of air [prana, apana, vyana, samana and udana], is situated within the heart, and spreads its influence all over the body of the embodied living entities. When the soul is purified from the contamination of the five kinds of material air, its spiritual influence is exhibited."

The word atheism itself was not coined until the 16th century.[8] <br>  <br>  The earliest possible examples of atheism involve Eastern religions such as Jainism, Buddhism and Taoism, which do not include a deity. These date back to the 6th century BC, but there is some dispute over whether these religions can be classified as atheistic, in the sense of denying the existence of gods, as many other branches of these religions do incorporate deity worship. In some such religions, the question of the existence of gods is considered to be unimportant rather than a question which can be answered one way or the other. This stance can be better described by the neologism apatheism. <br>  <br>  Atheism can also be traced to Ancient Greece in the 5th century BC. Diagoras of Melos is often referred to as "The First Atheist", and other men who claimed to be atheists include Theodorus of Cyrene and Euhemerus. Epicurus and Lucretius, who are often described as atheists, believed that the gods existed but that they were unconcerned with human affairs: a position better described as Deism than atheism. Protagoras espoused a position which we would describe today as agnosticism, stating that "With regard to the gods I am unable to say either that they exist or do not exist."[9] At the time, however, atheism was a capital offense in Greece - it was the crime for which Socrates was executed, though he denied the charge. It is therefore possible that some individuals may have concealed their true beliefs. <br>  <br>  In Medieval and Renaissance Europe, instances of atheism are rare. The existence of arguments put forward to demonstrate God's existence by Aquinas, Anselm and others suggests that non-belief was not unheard of, but few records of it are known. <br>  <br>  Modern atheism did not begin until the Enlightenment. In addition, the French Revolution increased the spread of atheism in Europe.[10] Baron D'Holbach's book The System of Nature was the first publication which explicitly denied the existence of God. Other atheists from this time included the philosopher David Hume. Others denied being atheists (heresy and blasphemy were capital offences) but held materialistic, empiricist, broadly deistic views; these include Voltaire, Thomas Hobbes, Thomas Paine, John Locke, Immanuel Kant and Benjamin Franklin. <br>  <br>  So its not all about THE bible.|`|AA10554783	I would agree with Latourette if he had merely claimed that "Jesus" was known at least by name by billions. (But of those billions, how many different interpretations of "Jesus" exist?) I would also agree if he had merely claimed that the human story had been influenced to varying degrees by different interpretations of "Jesus." But to brashly claim that "Measured by his influence, Jesus is central to the human story" demonstrates Latourette's blind religious devotion rather than his commitment to historical truth and accuracy. The "human story" is old and brimming over with "influences" stretching back to ancient civilizations both East and West. In Western civilization alone there were ancient Near Eastern influences; Greek/Roman politics, art, architecture, law, science and philosophy; Islamic mathematics, astronomy, philosophy (including the thousands of Greek and Roman manuscripts preserved by Islamic scholars at the library of Seville that played a crucial role in re-igniting Western society's intellectual progress). Other major influences include "guns, germs, and steel;"[13] the Renaissance; the Enlightenment; modern day socialist, humanist and feminist influences and ideals; and "common sense" (as Thomas Paine might say).<br>  <br>  Speaking of the crucial influence that the Enlightenment exerted upon Christianity, theologian Albert Schweitzer pointed out, "For centuries Christianity treasured the great commandment of love and mercy as traditional truth without recognizing it as a reason for opposing slavery, witch burning and all the other ancient and medieval forms of inhumanity. It was only when Christianity experienced the influence of the thinking of the Age of Enlightenment that it was stirred into entering the struggle for humanity. The remembrance of this ought to preserve it forever from assuming any air of superiority in comparison with thought."[14]<br>  <br>  Pulitzer prize-winning political scientist, Francis Fukuyama put it this way: "There was a time when religion played an all-powerful role in European politics with Protestants and Catholics organizing themselves into political factions and squandering the wealth of Europe on sectarian wars. [Like the "Thirty Year's War" that began in 1618 when Protestant leaders threw two Catholic emissaries out of a Prague window, and which turned central Europe into a wasteland of misery, leading to the deaths of more than a quarter of Europe's population. - ED.] English liberalism emerged in direct reaction to the religious fanaticism of the English Civil War. Contrary to those who at the time believed that religion was a necessary and permanent feature of the political landscape, liberalism vanquished religion in Europe. After a centuries-long confrontation with liberalism, religion was taught to be tolerant. In the sixteenth century, it would have seemed strange to most Europeans not to use political power to enforce belief in their particular sectarian faith. Today, the idea that the practice of religion other than one's own should injure one's own faith seems bizarre, even to the most pious churchmen. Religion has been relegated to the sphere of private life - exiled, it would seem, more or less permanently from European political life except on certain narrow issues like abortion... Religion per se did not create free societies; Christianity in a certain sense had to abolish itself through a secularization of its goals before liberalism could emerge...Political liberalism in England ended the religious wars between Protestant and Catholic that had nearly destroyed that country during the seventeenth century: with its advent, religion was defanged by being made tolerant."[15]<br>  <br>  Even Robert Wuthnow, an evangelical Christian writer, admitted in Books & Culture (a newsletter produced by the editors of Christianity Today), "Framers of modern democratic theory in eighteenth century Europe [and colonial America - ED.] were profoundly influenced by the religious wars that had dominated the previous century and a half. Locke's emphasis on tolerance and Rousseau's idea of a social contract were efforts to find unifying agreements that would discourage religious groups from appealing absolutely to a higher source of authority. The idea of civil society emerged as a way of saying that people who disagree with each other about such vital matters as religion could nevertheless live together in harmony."[16]

G2tnn5yjaa	Why is Satan so down on peanuts? His actions seem churlish to me. Why couldn't he defile Brazil nuts since I don't much care for them? Or perhaps some other legume?

Regardless of your belief system; 'religion' is often a human creation to provide order within a society.  (I don't mean that man created or did not create the belief in God.  That is slightly different than 'religion' and not something you can find evidence of without finding evidence of 'religion'.)  If you are not a social human race by nature, why would you need a religion.  Now, whether they believed in a god of any sort is not something they can determine.  The fossil record is too scanty at best, and no evidence has been found to show any evidence of organized beliefs of any kind.  May I also remind you that Homo Erectus are distant cousins in the evolutionary chain at best.  They are not technically the same as Homo Sapiens, therefore you might as well be comparing gorillas and humans in regard to religion.|`|gl4MePuDaa	in anthropology we were taught that some of these early men buried their dead, used crude tools, and threw flowers on the body before burying<br>  <br>  as to religion, i don't know if they were advanced enough to organize such a thing as complex and stupid|`|M7r8oaUzaa	animism<br>  <br>  no need for capitalization, just like atheist.<br>  <br>  no prophets<br>  <br>  only worship the environment... to which all animals and plants belong, <br>  <br>  the fire of life that burns through everything|`|5jsMY4RIaa	Archaeologists have found Venus figures (little statues of women w/ huge boobs and huge hips) at hundreds of sites.

AA10471679	Oh, for openers, how about Matthew 16:16?<br>  <br>  Let's go back even further to Jesus' first "public sermon" as recorded in Luke 4:16-21.<br>  <br>  Jesus left His disciples no good news to proclaim?<br>  <br>  Here's your sign.|`|FATyhyZ2aa	The good news = The kingdom of God.<br>  A lot will say the good news is Jesus Christ. But Jesus said in Luke 4:43 that He must preach the Kingdom of God "because on this (mission) I was sent."<br>  <br>  Then just use a search engine in new testament for "Kingdom" & "God" to find out WHAT Jesus was preaching about on this topic.|`|oC0HfFm1aa	Grace.|`|fdb2eb2f4c9344e092dc65cdb24a9c1eaa	The oldest liturgical prayer recorded, in 1 Corinthians 16:22, is dated at around 55 A.D. It refers to Jesus as Lord. So does the earliest sermon and the earliest account of martyrdom. The authors of the NT epistles, including and especially Paul, even in his undisputed letters, use the language of divine Wisdom with reference to Jesus. The earliest pagan report of the church's activities indicates that Jesus was worshipped as Lord. Paul's letters, written between 49 and 65 A.D., exhibit the same fully-evolved Christology; logically, he must have gotten it from sometime earlier than 49 A.D. Paul cites creeds, hymns and sayings of Jesus that must have come from earlier (Rom. 1:3-4; 1 Cor. 11:23; Col. 1:15-16; Phil. 2:6-11; 1 Tim. 3:16; 2 Tim. 2:8); these items translate easily into Aramaic and show features of Hebrew poetry and thought-forms, which allows us to trace their origins to Jesus' first followers in Judea, between 33 and 48 A.D. [More.ScCy, 161-5] All of this leads to the inevitable conclusion that the concept of Jesus as divine quite definitely existed within, at the very least, a decade of the crucifixion, and therefore, was likely to have been asserted before His death by Jesus Himself, as is recorded in the Gospels.<br>  <br>  The good news is the resurrection! God has already appeared — in the person of Jesus Christ. He did not come to condemn, but to save. He brought a message of forgiveness, and he died on a cross to guarantee that we may be forgiven. The message of Jesus, the message of the cross, is good news for all who feel their guilt. Jesus, the divine human, has died for us. Forgiveness is given freely to all.|`|iSmZzrExaa	Whoever told you that the Apostles didn't know what the Gospel was until Pentecost was mistaken.  <br>  <br>  When Jesus rose from the dead, and spent time with the apostles, they had full understanding of God's plan of salvation.  An example of this is immediately after his resurrection, Jesus met to disciples on the road to Emmaus, and explained to them from the scriptures everything.  (Luke 24).   The Great Commission was subsequent to that event.|`|xo4iux9gaa	"Repent "....for Christ was in their midst....that is good news.|`|f3nwI8ytaa	The good new was the resurrection.

That you want more in your life than to worry about the cops, dealers or other drug users or criminal types near you.

9BeUbORtaa	Hardly anything these days is "natural". The important question is not what is "natural" but what is sustainable. Scrub-burning is not 'natural' - rather it is the product of thousands of years of human interaction with diverse environments, in which human societies and the environment have both shaped each other. In Australia, for example, where bush-burning was practiced for tens of thousands of years by Aborigines, it replaced lush forest-cover with dry scrubland which required regular burning to stimulate regrowth.  <br>  <br>  Yes, it does seem that in some areas of dry-forest and scrubland controlled forest fires might be the best way of managing the environment. That said, newspaper photographs of fatally-burned wallabies and koala bears are never going to be popular.  Fires which are lit by arsonists are not controlled, and they are not a sustainable way of regenerating large areas of forest.|`|e5f8b9685ec9f440ed81d5aea8e10ed0aa	A serious answer to your mocking question....<br>  <br>  Some fires are part of a natural or at least historical fire cycle.  Some environments thrive after fires and many plants will not even seed without fire.<br>  <br>  But... people have often prevented some low level fires and left many areas with excessive dead fall.  This dead plant material makes fires that are unnaturally hot.  This doesn't help the natural plants to thrive, but just burns them to bits... check out what happened to Yellowstone for example.<br>  <br>  So... sometimes fire is good and sometimes fire is bad (assuming you want to protect bio-diversity).<br>  <br>  If you don't care about bio-diversity then what are you talking about... really?|`|jAPBNtMKaa	It depends. Yes forest firers are normal but there can and likely are some human created conditions which cause them to occur more frequently that would be expected if human development wasn't happening.<br>  <br>  Personally I don't think they are a huge deal. While it is personally devastating for people to lose their homes, I think if you build you home in an area that is susceptible, you just have to be emotionally prepared for that outcome.|`|vL8JErXNaa	Bad trolling is unnatural|`|nwdwKnS7aa	Apparently some were started.

This means we love others with the love of God which is the fruit of the Spirit (Galatians 5:22,23).  This love has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit (Romans 5:5) so we are all empowered to love others with God's love.

Forgiveness is loving someone even though they have sinned (even if it is against you). You do not have to like the person or buy them lunch; but you must love them just as they must love you. <br>  <br>  That is why Jesus says to love your enemy.

Beyond that, even if a planet did have all the necessary elements to support life, then it isn't a guarantee that life will even start there. Look up abiogenesis.

They don't evolve for future conditions, they evolve for current conditions.  If they do not evolve to fit current conditions, then they die off.  Due to our destructive nature and what we are doing to the planet is actually causing certain evolutionary changes in front of us as other species are starting to die off due to global warming and other environmental factors where humans have contributed.  The AIDS viruse is a perfect example for evolution that you have been seeing and is proof.  If evolves until the host dies and therfore it dies off.  You don't see it survive outside of any human body therefore conditions for it outside of an animal organism is not viable.  Conditions on Earth make it viable for all current species to live and evolve or die off.<br>  Other planets do not have the same conditions or temperature necessary for life to exist therefore evolution cannot occur where there is no life. Evolution is not the biologist answer for life on Earth, it is the explaination for our current living situation.  There has actually been evidence of life in microorganismal form on Mars but due to changing environment of mars and distance from the sun, it was not able to sustain itself to evolve because there was no possible way to respirate.  All life must have a type of respiration in order for it to live and must have some type of nourishment.  If not then the species cannot survive and that is what happened there.|`|baW9sSsLaa	Why should it be strange?  Under evolution as we understand it, certain conditions must exist before life can occur.  The other planets in our solar system do not meet those conditions, hence no life.  <br>  <br>  I might as well ask, if creationism is literal, why your God didn't populate the other planets He made?  Are they just there for background scenery?|`|Blajij6iaa	It goes to show that life forms on planets where conditions suit it.  Do you know anything about the environment of the other planets in our solar system?  Not too hospitable.  And if you knew a thing or two about cosmology, you wouldn't think it was so strange that life did not spring forth on these other planets.|`|q1EDNQhBaa	OMG, your the first person i have ever spoken to who has been to all of those planets! WOW!  lololol They have found life on other planets  errr MARS! Micro organism things! I have studied animal care at college and a large part of it was related to evolution. I cant understand how people dont get it tho? When it is studied etc its actually quite easy to understand!<br>  Not being rude by the way but we will not know about other life forms for along time!|`|zRyI5CMGaa	Well we do not know that, only recently more planets have been discovered light years away from our planet earth (I have an open mind). Besides the Universe is vast and we have not discovered or have the capability yet to discover the Universe fully. Nothing is impossible with God our creator, maybe there are other life forms out there or maybe we are not meant to know.

Many of them are believed to support some kind of life. Other planets that we know of do not have water so nothing can live|`|4OEOxOmPaa	What about all the other planets they've been discovering? There is a plan to go to Europa (Moon of Jupiter) and see if there is life in the ocean under the ice.|`|io7nHB3Oaa	NASA is spending billions sending probes to Mars and the moons of Jupiter and Saturn because they don't believe our solary system is void of life.|`|jAPBNtMKaa	Carbon based life can only exist within a narrow environmental range.|`|izuuZsZlaa	evolution is not true. and life is devoid in our solar system cause that is how god wanted it.|`|PM9MQHjRaa	Evolution is a lie.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	Have you ever seen non-carbon based life?  Because no one else has.|`|ODTe2l77aa	How do you know there is no life on other planets?  We've never even been able to put a person on one of them yet.  For all we know, life on other planets does exist.|`|lTx8Hoheaa	Maybe God created life on Earth through evolution.|`|AA11297267	Mercury is too hot to have liquid water, and the only kind of life we know about depends on liquid water.  It also has no atmosphere, as it's not massive enough to hold onto one.<br>  <br>  Jupiter and Saturn don't have solid surfaces, and have quite noxious atmospheres -- they're not places that are conducive to life.<br>  <br>  Venus could have been...but a runaway greenhouse effect from too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has made it way too hot and the atmosphere too toxic for life to develop there.<br>  <br>  Why is the simple fact that life emerged and evolved in our solar system on the only planet that has the right conditions any kind of proof against evolution?  If anything, it's proof *for* evolution -- in the one place in our solar system where our kind of life could emerge and evolve, it did.  If "god" has anything to do with it, why would he bother to make any other planets at all?  They serve no purpose for "his" creation here, so they're just wasteful.<br>  <br>  We *think* it might be possible for non-carbon-based life to exist...but as yet we don't have any evidence for it.  So the answer is we don't know, not "goddidit."  When we find planets around other stars that can and do support life (which may be carbon-based or may not), then we can answer the question.  Until then, "we don't know" is the only correct answer -- there's no evidence that shows any god had anything to do with any of it.<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|89MKzLl3aa	Earth is in the perfect alignment with the Sun to create and sustain life. If we were closer, earth would probably be a dry wasteland, if further away probably an icy world. It doesn't mean that changes aren't happening to other planets, and there are. Also, the universe is in constant motion and changing every day.|`|RJRantBfaa	"... and stuff?"<br>  <br>  What about OUTSIDE our solar system?<br>  <br>  Evolution and faith are not mutually exclusive and I'm not sure why you're insisting upon it, seeing as Genesis was metaphorical (and has been so documented through Biblical scholarship).|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	What does one have to do with the other?  That's like asking "if evolution occurs in the oceans on earth, why doesn't it occur inside volcanoes?".|`|19PgkkFWaa	wow your narrow minded, ok well seeing as your most likely a christian you wouldn't know a thing about this so i will explain. Mercury is to close to the sun it gets around 800 degrees there, jupiter and saturn are gas giants and don't have a surface so its impossible for them to have life, venus is clouded in carbon monoxide and gets to around 700 degrees so i highly doubt there is life there. Maybe if you looked into it you most likely candidate is mars cause it has water underneath the surface so there is probably microscopic life there, you know huge rivers flowed on mars once right? our galaxy has probably around 10,000 earth like planets so there might be intelligent life, and the universe has billions of Galaxy's and even more earth like planets so there is most likely intelligent life 10000x smarter than us|`|8urFS6RMaa	<sigh><br>  <br>  It ain't all THAT strange, considering the necessity of liquid water for the formation of life -- at least, life that's like the kind of life we have on Earth.<br>  <br>  Besides which, we've barely even begun exploring our solar system.  It may very well turn out that Mars and subsurface Europa are TEEMING with life, if we ever get astronauts with microscopes up there to take a closer look...|`|XAlCd8Ebaa	Evolution doesn't matter if the conditions for life to come about in the first place aren't in place. Earth is the only planet in our solar system that currently has those conditions, so we're the only place in the solar system where evolution is currently happening.|`|vxSXsn59aa	You do realize that, once life is found on Mars, your whole fragile little belief system comes tumbling down around you, right? You might wish to consider getting with the program before that happens.|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	Just a five degree extra tilt in our planet and life would be impossible on Earth as well...<br>  The conception of intelligent life on this planet can only be described as miraculous.|`|vL8JErXNaa	A true non sequiter|`|hmU2udmRaa	because the conditions are not right for life.|`|DDFgKxcaaa	they're either too close or too far from the sun to sustain life

By the time 2030 arrives, he will have revised Einstien's theories of relativity, correcting them for the additionall 4 dimenstions.  It will take another 50 years before a sufficiently large and powerful enough supercollider is built to prove his theories, but they will foster an age of interstellar travel that allows men to not only approach the speed of light, but to shift dimension and exceed it.  Although not exactly similiar to that proposed in the science fiction TV series, it will be dubbed 'warp' travel.<br>  <br>  By 2110 the first interstellar travel space ship will be built, and by 2150 there will be hundreds.  By 2200 will will have found 12 other planets that contain higher order animal life, although none yet found have evolved to the point of humanity's mental capacity and the use of complex language.  We'll keep looking though.<br>  <br>  uh... never say "never."|`|M3sVQm2Maa	I don't think you understand what "proof" consists of. How is not being able to do something "proof" that god made the earth? The two are not related in the slightest. As for life on other planets, it may or may not exist. But statistically, there is a good chance that of the billions of stars in the universe, there is a yellow one with a planet at just the right distance away and with just the right conditions to support life. There may even be thousands. But whether there is or isn't hasn't got anything at all to do with a god.|`|19PgkkFWaa	Noooo that doesn't prove anything it proves where not that advanced yet. Have you ever heard of einsteins wormhole theory? that you could go into a black hole and come out on the other side of the universe or in another galaxy, also you said you don't believe in UFOs why is that? cause if we find or get visited by intelligent life that would prove 'god' wrong|`|Hwe4MA6Faa	I think of it like this, there had be a starting point of our universe and ther has to be a finishing point.<br>  <br>  As we observe our universe and time and space, it is as though the universe is eternal, it must be, there is no limitation of area or mass, there is no inside and outside, eternal in nature and composition yet we are finite in our physical life.<br>  <br>  Therefore our spiritual life is eternal like the universe.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	No. That is completely illogical.

All of these scientist who have tried to prove there is no GOD can not even tell us what is on the other side. How can they try to prove their theories against GOD when they do not even know what is all out there. They have no proof that Heaven or God doesn't exist, but yet they want us to believe their theories on how everything was made. <br>  GOD is real and he does exist.

swkhohjgaa	For me my whole life has been one of continued identification and can change as I continue to learn. So far my knowledge and personal experience leads me to the understanding that I'm Bi. When I love someone it is both emotionally and sexually. <br>  <br>  Bisexuality is a sexual orientation characterized by attraction to both men and women. Unlike pansexuality, it does not specifically include people who fall outside the gender binary. Pansexuality has been described as a "means to skip the binaries and essentialism of 'bi'.<br>  <br>  However, many people who identify as bisexual are actually attracted to people who fall outside the gender binary. These people, who could be described as pansexual, have a variety of reasons for identifying as bisexual, including widespread unfamiliarity with the term "pansexual" as well as its negative connotations for some people.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|uky2nsh8aa	it simply means you like both. <br>  whether u date both at once or not would be monogamy/polygamy.|`|HH90Eghaaa	Both are correct definitions, it all depends on the bisexuals preference!|`|tVUBqdSzaa	bisexual means you are attracted to both male and females<br>  <br>  dating more than one person at time doesn't matter if your you're gay, straight, bi, or lesbian, it just means you're playing games with peoples feelings.|`|lKE1ObbXaa	the second one,<br>  but the technical definition of a bisexual is<br>  "someone who reaches down the front of someones pants and is happy with whatever they find"<br>  :)<br>  hope i helped :)|`|2ydF6OTAaa	bisexual=gay, however will sleep w/ the opposite sex.|`|vDG0iA8laa	A baseball term....

But there is also what is known as a "monogamous bisexual", which can be construed two ways:  one is if they only date one gender at a time.  The other meaning is that, like a monogamous heterosexual or homosexual couple (they only date that person they are with).  <br>  <br>  For instance, I have a friend who identifies herself as a "monogamous bisexual" when she is sticking to a certain gender (which seems odd to me given the definition of monogamy)...but my brother's best friend's wife defines herself the same way, saying she is attracted to both sexes, but chooses only one man to be with.|`|gWJqarq8aa	well being bisexual means you are physically, emotionally  and mentally attracted to females and males, now if your a good person and have a genuine heart you will one person at the time but eitha way your bisexual if your able to date both!|`|paRGbr7Xaa	Being bisexual means you can date either men or women.

spbqfjvbaa	My wife & I do want kids.  We're still discussing how we are going to start a family.

There are so many kids out there who want , need, & deserve a loving stable home that I know that my wife & I could provide for them.<br>  <br>  My Pop for the longest time wanted me to have kids the "old fashioned way".  Once I told him that lesbianism=really not wanting to have sex with a man, he got the hint & a good chuckle.<br>  <br>  AI & IVF are out since the extra fertilized eggs are destroyed.  My wife is very pro life, & I respect her wishes.|`|z2xRXM5Laa	I am a lesbian and I never wanted to reproduce. I gave it some thought but it just wasn't for me, even though I'd be okay with adoption.  Besides, I cannot have children. Having kids isn't the sole purpose of humanity.  My wife hopes to have a baby and we will raise it together.  She is able to have children and if we do, she will be artificially inseminated.  She won't be having intercourse because she is my wife and she doesn't sleep with men.  But we can deposit a man's sperm into her just as heterosexual couples do when the husband cannot give his wife a baby.  They get another man's sperm.  The woman doesn't have sex with some other man, and neither would my wife.<br>  Gay people can have babies, even if it's not through intercourse.  Same goes for heterosexuals. Many of them are born without the ability to reproduce and that happens for a reason, too.  Nobody has to have intercourse to reproduce.  I hate it when religious people say that gays are wrong and cannot reproduce.  We CAN reproduce.  Just because we don't want heterosexual relationships doesn't mean we don't have reproductive organs that we use.  Does a religious person's theory mean that straight people who cannot have kids are also some kind of abomination?  Their whole concept is so stupid and they don't even see it.

Therefore listen to what I am saying to you very carefully and TAKE THESE WORDS TO THOSE WHO COULD NOT BE PRESENT HERE TODAY.<br>  O People, just as you regard this month, this day, this city as Sacred, so regard the life and property of every Muslim as a sacred trust. Return the goods entrusted to you to their rightful owners. Hurt no one so that no one may hurt you. Remember that you will indeed meet your LORD, and that HE will indeed reckon your deeds. ALLAH has forbidden you to take usury (interest), therefore all interest obligation shall henceforth be waived. Your capital, however, is yours to keep. You will neither inflict nor suffer any inequity. Allah has Judged that there shall be no interest and that all the interest due to Abbas ibn 'Abd'al Muttalib (Prophet's uncle) shall henceforth be waived...<br>  Beware of Satan, for the safety of your religion. He has lost all hope that he will ever be able to lead you astray in big things, so beware of following him in small things.<br>  O People, it is true that you have certain rights with regard to your women, but they also have rights over you. Remember that you have taken them as your wives only under Allah's trust and with His permission. If they abide by your right then to them belongs the right to be fed and clothed in kindness. Do treat your women well and be kind to them for they are your partners and committed helpers. And it is your right that they do not make friends with any one of whom you do not approve, as well as never to be unchaste.<br>  O People, listen to me in earnest, worship ALLAH, say your five daily prayers (Salah), fast during the month of Ramadan, and give your wealth in Zakat. Perform Hajj if you can afford to.<br>  All mankind is from Adam and Eve, an Arab has no superiority over a non-Arab nor a non-Arab has any superiority over an Arab; also a white has no superiority over black nor a black has any superiority over white except by piety and good action. Learn that every Muslim is a brother to every Muslim and that the Muslims constitute one brotherhood. Nothing shall be legitimate to a Muslim which belongs to a fellow Muslim unless it was given freely and willingly. Do not, therefore, do injustice to yourselves.<br>  Remember, one day you will appear before ALLAH and answer your deeds. So beware, do not stray from the path of righteousness after I am gone.<br>  O People, NO PROPHET OR APOSTLE WILL COME AFTER ME AND NO NEW FAITH WILL BE BORN.

Lutheran churches are basically the same except they don't pray to mary or the saints and the preachers can get married.  But as far as ritualistic services... they are the same.  Everything is read from a script... and it's sort of like a bunch of robots all saying and doing the same things lol<br>  <br>  I used to say that if someone said "praise the Lord" during service or if they raised their hands to praise the Lord during a song... that at least 1/2 of the church would have had a heart attack because it wasn't in their ritual lol<br>  <br>  But all joking aside... Lutherans are Christians... but not for me.  Different people need different types of churches that teach the same things.

It is as close as I can get to simple facts. The Catholics are the oldest Christian fellowship. Their core beliefs are solid but they do a lot of traditional things that are sort of weird. Because of this, a lot of people split off from the Catholics resulting in the protestant fellowships. When you start to break down the protestant fellowships you will find that they are very similar in beliefs. For example Lutheran Vs Baptist = Lutherans are more formal and ritualistic where Baptist are a little louder and informal. It becomes a matter of taste. Because of the endless verity of Protestant Churches I won't list them all here. You will find that they are all centered on the Bible. The Bible is the bottom line and blue print for the "Church". The actual "Church" is made up of everyone who puts their faith in Christ finished work on the cross. It consist of every denomination. Denominations are like cars. Do you like Chevy, Ford, Dodge or Honda? They all help us get around.<br>  <br>  I must include the fringe groups or "cults" as we like to call them. There are also many of them. They can be easily identified by applying two questions to their beliefs.<br>  1. Who do they say Jesus is? If the answer is anything but GOD in the flesh come to redeem a lost and dieing world, then they are not following Jesus.<br>  2. Salvation is through Jesus finished work on the cross? If they add anything to this or require anything in addition to the cross they are the most deadly sort of cult. Some are very close to Christianity and fool a lot of people. Jesus is enough. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps a little. This is more like a context then an explanation.|`|nCU4mgbHaa	Well to start with Catholics, Baptists, Lutherans are all denominations of the same religion, Christianity.

Jsqlkb3caa	We would always do two large main dishes..one that was vegetarian, since we always have several people visiting that do not eat meat. it is usually something like a vegetable quiche. We would also do something like roasted lamb, or ham, since lamb is often expensive. Lamb is a tradition spring dish..and historically Ostara would have been a time to use the last of the meats cured for winter use, so ham fits well. We would *always* have honey cakes and hot cross buns. Deviled eggs were a staple as well. Lots of fresh leafy greens, salads and whatnot always go over well to. OH and rosemary roasted potatoes. Those are one of my favorites!! Well, now I'm hungry. Off to raid the vending machine. I hope you have a wonderful Ostara!

xOiyuDataa	Yes, God did make us. He created Adam and Eve and we were born from them. This may sound strange, but in those days, they didn't have the rules that we have now concerning incest. Adam and Eve bore Cain and Abel, and Cain and Abel went into their sisters (or rather, had sexual relations with them) which of course, created offspring, and we come down from them, and now here we are.<br>  In the bible, God says that 'Before you were in your mothers womb, I knew you.' Yes, we are predestined. Basically, God was already thinking about you and me from the moment He created Adam from the dust of the earth. Even When God said 'Let there Be LIGHT!' God was thinking about you.<br>  God has mapped out each and every one of our lives whether we belive it or not... We all have a destiny and a purpose to fill, an individual calling. How can one belive that there is no God? The human brain is too intricate and genuis to think that we were just randomly formed to do nothing on the earth. We should open our eyes, cause there is a bigger picture. It takes a genius, a creator to create such a masterpiece as the human being. And only God could do such a thing.<br>  And by the way, I saw a billboard the other day which said :<br>  'If there PROBABLY isn't a God, we better start worrying...' Remember, if there ("PROBABLY") isn't.<br>  People do not want to believe in God, because they simply do not want to face their master, their creator one day. Some people just don't want to meet their maker. Look around you, at this world, this creation. It seems foolish for one to say that there is no God when you deeply think about it all......<br>  <br>  Answering to what you just wrote additionally, all I can say is that, that is something which you will have to ask God when you meet Him one day, but for now, all I know is that Jesus Chrsit has changed my life, and I know that when I follow God's word I see the difference in my life. When i have on purpose lived in sin and have chosen to do what I want, my life just becomes an instant mess... I know that if it wasn't for Jesus I wouldn't be the person I am today. Jesus Chrsit suffered on the cross and died a brutal death just for me, to cleanse me of my sins, and even if you were the only one on the earth, He would have done it just for you. Jesus Chrsit loves you, and I know He loves me too, because I feel his love always around me... If you haven't seen the movie 'The Passion Of The Chrsit' then you should go and see it...<br>  <br>  Limerickdogred, excuse me??? I actually know people who dont want to believe in God, and I know people who don't want to believe in God, but really do. I have an idea, don't tell me I dont. Cause we are not talking face to face it is difficult to have this kind of conversation. So i will not keep adding more and more to this cause I have no time to do so. God is there for us, whoever wants to believe on Him can, whoever doesn't, doesn't.

a9etFur6aa	Men put it in there to assert their superiority over women. <br>  <br>  Prior to organized religion, you had nature cults and things like that and often women were worshipped because they gave birth to new life. Eventually, the concept of property developed along with agriculture and property became a new measure of power in society. Hammurabi's code, the first written law, is mostly about property rights and this is again to protect that power. To further protect the power, women were made second class citizens. Modern religion is from ancient times and just a reflection of this.|`|Q6qyfPkRaa	i dont interpret it anyway. however i do interpret the word of GOD as it is written, with that said, the bible indicates that i am to submit when man is doing and fulfilling all of his obligations towards me (a female).. if he does not do this i am not required to be submissive  and is what the word implies and personally speaking  i will NOT be submissive unless man does what he has to do and treats me like the queen that i am... notwithstanding, it also mentions that he should be fair in his treatment towards her to not make it unbearable for the woman.|`|db7df25ea31227e5641d5c32d43c3bcdaa	no it was not put in to control women<br>  <br>  God established in his creation a order.<br>  <br>  God gave men orders on how they should be treated.<br>  <br>  Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, even as Christ also loved the church, and gave himself for it; <br>  <br>  Husbands are to love their wife as Jesus loved the church and even died for it.

Let's check the facts:<br>  <br>  1. God's word--the Bible--is said to be "God breathed."  NOTE: That is NOT the same as inerrant, which many Christians say.  Think "divinely inspired."  <br>  <br>  2. The Bible tells us that God is omniscient (all knowing) and omnipoent (all powerful).  <br>  <br>  3. The Bible was written by people.<br>  <br>  You cannot possibly put much emphasis on number 3 IF you believe numbers 1 and 2!  My editorial on the subject:<br>  <br>  If man was free to write whatever he wanted to write, could he have said say ... "God is not real?"  If you say, OF COURSE NOT then why not?  You are SAYING that man could write anything he wanted to write.  You are suggesting that it wasn't God's work, God's will, and God's message, but rather that of mortal men.  <br>  <br>  If man couldn't have tampered with God's messages about how we're saved or who or what God is then why would you believe that man would be allowed to tamper with messages about women's roles?  So, God said in effect: "When it comes to the role of women, write whatever you want to write, I don't care"?  Seriously?  You believe that?!  <br>  <br>  See, I'm saying to you that the attack that "man" wrote the Bible is ALWAYS by people who don't believe in God.  So, they IGNORE or even THROW OUT 1 and 2 and just hammer and hammer on number 3.  If you believe that then that's fine!  There is no God and some people made up a book about a fake God.  Peachy!  But if you believe numbers 1 and 2 then you cannot possibly believe that man was somehow able to "slip some stuff by God" that doesn't represent His word.  <br>  <br>  If I may be blunt, it's a downright stupid thing to believe and it makes your faith look like a sham!|`|m3YC7Jcyaa	WWW never trust<br>  Your work you never know<br>  your weather you never know<br>  woman you just never know.<br>  <br>  do you see any woman prophets?

He who loves his wife loves himself. 29After all, no one ever hated his own body, but he feeds and cares for it, just as Christ does the church— 30for we are members of his body. 31"For this reason a man will leave his father and mother and be united to his wife, and the two will become one flesh."[c] 32This is a profound mystery—but I am talking about Christ and the church. 33However, each one of you also must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.|`|aPuUuWlLaa	I believe that it is a product of the patriarchal societies these religions arose in and thus they reflect the culture.

He hides the prophet in the cleft of a rock and passes by. Moses does not actually see the Lord but hears His words: "The Lord, the Lord God, merciful and gracious, longsuffering, and abounding in goodness and truth; keeping mercy for thousands, forgiving iniquity, transgressions, and sins; by no means clearing the guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children to the third and fourth generation."<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.joemckeever.com/mt/archives/001034.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joemckeever.com/mt/archives/0...</a><br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Interesting research:<br>  <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=LNaVhMuWRtYC&pg=PA80&lpg=PA80&dq=explain+Exodus+34:6&source=bl&ots=tujBDkwJZ5&sig=i7sgy36zmH8QTWoTEpzo8AL7qN4&hl=en&ei=RWilSZujFaGbtwem-snRBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=7&ct=result#PPA83,M1" rel="nofollow">http://books.google.com/books?id=LNaVhMu...</a><br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  Here, we see the personality of God.  All goodness, all grace, all<br>  truth, all mercy, and even long-suffering in all of this.  At the very<br>  same time that we see all of this goodness, we also see justice.  The<br>  Lord is the Judge of all the world.  They had known God until this<br>  time as Jehovah. The Self-Existant One.  This name "Jehovah" had shown the power, and greatness of God. Now, we see the Lord revealing to Moses more of Himself in His dealings with man.  We are told by Jesus that He is the Truth, Word, and Light. The name that tells all about God is the one that I believe He revealed Himself to Moses here.  This name is not to be spoken or written by mere man. We will not know this name until we hear it in heaven. Most people want the Lord to be all the good things, and want to forget that He is, also, the Judge, and that He is just. Forgiveness is the only way to get to heaven. Jesus is the door we must go through. There is no other way. Without Jesus' shed blood, we would be judged and found guilty as charged. We have been pardoned, and justified; just as if we had never sinned.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lovethelord.com/books/Exodus/57.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lovethelord.com/books/Exodus/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  See also:<br>  <a href="http://bible.cc/exodus/34-6.htm" rel="nofollow">http://bible.cc/exodus/34-6.htm</a>

Anyone with multiple spouses, who keeps any of those spouses a secret from the others, is a liar.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, a polygamous, polyandrous, or group marriage can be source of great stability and support, if everyone enters into it as truly consenting adults, with love and optimism.|`|OLnmXeWDaa	I really don't want a husband who sleeps with other women.

And they will have to beat their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning shears. They will not lift up sword, nation against nation, neither will they learn war anymore.<br>  <br>  In our day, when fear covers the earth like an ominous cloud, we are thrilled that many are learning Jehovah’s ways. We long for the time now near at hand when all such lovers of God will learn war no more but will sit under their own vine and fig tree. Fig trees are often planted in vineyards. (Luke 13:6) Sitting under one’s own vine and fig tree symbolizes peaceful, prosperous, and secure conditions. Even now, our relationship with Jehovah gives us peace of mind and spiritual security. When such circumstances exist under Kingdom rule, we will be unafraid and totally secure.<br>  <br>  To enjoy divine favor and blessing, we must walk in Jehovah’s name. This is powerfully expressed at Micah 4:5, where the prophet declares: “All the peoples, for their part, will walk each one in the name of its god; but we, for our part, shall walk in the name of Jehovah our God to time indefinite, even forever.” Walking in Jehovah’s name does not mean merely saying that he is our God. It calls for more than our participation in Christian meetings and the Kingdom-preaching work, although such activities are also vital. If we are walking in Jehovah’s name, we are dedicated to him and are endeavoring to serve him faithfully out of whole-souled love. (Matthew 22:37) And as his worshipers, surely we are determined to walk in the name of Jehovah our God to all eternity.|`|GDexucXKaa	They're just trying to get on his good side, to cover up other wrongdoing.  <br>  <br>  That's what I think, anyway.|`|3d7f120f2bf9906d7333799542b3a295aa	Same reason the devil uses atheists to fight his battles

47181414a475aa26d8316adbb0d510d1aa	From reading Matt, Mark and Luke, you get the picture that Jesus is "a son of God".<br>  <br>  From John's gospel we learn that Jesus is not just a son (like all the other sons of God, Gen 6:2; Job 1:6, 38:7)<br>  <br>  but that he is the only begotten Son of God, the beginning of creation by God. (John 1:14, 3:16, 36; Rev 3:14.<br>  <br>  "Only begotten" literally means "sole made" or "solely created"<br>  <br>  Beginning comes from the greek meaning 'start of' or 'first in line'<br>  <br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  So Tim are you saying that Jesus is the "lonely" Son of God?<br>  <br>  Or are you saying the context should dictate the correct understanding of  a word.<br>  <br>  Fast:  to move quickly  (The fox ran fast)<br>  Fast:  to not be able to move. (The rabbit was held fast)<br>  Fast:  to not eat.  (Thus ending the fast of the fox)<br>  <br>  Context of the book of John and the other times it appears in the Gospels, always applies to someone child and it being their solely born child.<br>  <br>  (Luke 7:12) .?.?.there was a dead man being carried out, the only-begotten son of his mother..?.?.<br>  <br>  (Luke 8:42) 42?because he had an only-begotten daughter .?.?.<br>  <br>  (Luke 9:38) .?.?.“Teacher, I beg you to take a look at my son, because he is my only-begotten, <br>  <br>  Even when "only begotten" is used by Paul in Hebrews to discribe Jesus, it is in context with "solely created".<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------<br>  <br>  Tim,<br>  <br>  I do not believe monogenes means "lonely" at Ps. 25<br>  <br>  I do believe that the Hebrew word in question "yachiyd" [lonely], which is used in Ps 25, can also mean 'only begotten son' which is how the Septuagint translated it.<br>  <br>  The Hebrew word <br>  <br>  Strong's H3173 - yachiyd  can mean "only begotten son"<br>  [blue letter bible lexicon]<br>  <br>  1) only, only one, solitary, one<br>  <br>  a) only, unique, one<br>  <br>  b) solitary<br>  <br>  c) only begotten son<br>  <br>  so the translators of the Septuagint were not wrong to use mongenes.<br>  <br>  Just as 'fast' can mean quick, "quick" does not agree with all the definitions of fast.<br>  <br>  but even IF monogenes has 'several' meanings the bible translators of the KJV, NASB, NIV, YLT, NWT, and many more translate monogenes [Strong's G3439 - monogenēs] as 'ONLY BEGOTTEN'  and not as 'the other so call meanings of this word.  Why?  because the context denotes this as the correct understanding of mongenes when applied to Jesus.<br>  <br>  Even blue letter bible lexicon states under this word.<br>  <br>   "used of Christ, denotes the only begotten son of God"<br>  <br>  Look up only and begotten in your english dictionary and you will find that begotten means "to cause to exist"<br>  <br>  which is the same definition of the word 'create'.<br>  <br>  So even the 'bible' dictionaries and our english dictionaries denote 'only begotten' and 'only created' mean the same thing.<br>  <br>  Did you notice that this reference work doesn't use 'lonely' as a correct translation of the Hebrew word at Ps 25:16?<br>  <br>  This is another reason why I have found the NWT to be more accurate in it's translations.<br>  <br>  If I said:<br>  <br>  John got up and had breakfast before he left.<br>  <br>  and someone translated it as:<br>  <br>  John got up and had ruptured quickly before he left. <br>  <br>  they would be wrong,<br>  <br>  rupture is a synonym for break and quickly is a synonym for fast.<br>  <br>  yet when you place break & fast together you do not get ruptured quickly.<br>  <br>  Breakfast is a word thats meaning is the total of the two words that make the one word.<br>  <br>  monogenes is two words that make one word, "only" and "made"<br>  <br>  To say this word means "alone" is using only half of the word to make it's definition.<br>  <br>  Therefore 'only' or 'unique' are not complete translations and do not reflect the true meaning of the word.<br>  <br>  .|`|JMi0TrC0aa	I guess the answerer above did not see my rebuttal for the Greek word "monogenes" which can mean many different things other than "only begotten" or "solely created". <br>  <br>  In Psalm 25:16 the verse reads...<br>  <br>  16 Turn to me and be gracious to me, <br>         for I am lonely and afflicted.<br>  <br>  The Septuagint Greek word "monogenes" was used to describe David not as "solely created" but "lonely". This shows the word "monogenes" can mean many other things other than the "solely created", since David was not stating in that verse "...for I am [solely created] and afflicted." This does not make any grammatical sense, and the JWs were trying to grammatically correct the English translation of John 8:58? This shows the JWs' only real concern was their doctrines speaking throughout the whole NWT Bible, not God.<br>  <br>  Jesus being the "only begotten" in the Gospel of John should be looked into more closely not solely as a human but also as the Son who has the divine nature of the Father. JWs will only look into Jesus' human nature and build up a twisted theology making Jesus into a lesser being and making JWs (especially their so-called "anointed" elders) into higher beings. <br>  <br>  To answer the question, there is only one view of Jesus in all four Gospels, and that view is Jesus is God and He was worshiped and revered as such. There are other existing gospels by others who were with Jesus but they all have different views not in common with these four Gospels. This is why Matthew, Mark, Luke and John were canonized as part of the Holy Scripture, they are all showing a similar view of Jesus as God the Son.<br>  _______________<br>  <br>  TeeM...I am surprised at how you still won't see the truth re. "monogenes" can mean many different expressions other than "solely created". I guess you are indeed admitting that David did say the words "for I am [solely created] and afflicted" when applying your narrow minded definition of the Greek word "monogenes", and I guess you do indeed have a mixed up method in grammar usage.<br>  _______________<br>  <br>  TeeM...Your NWT Bible translated the Septuagint Greek word "monogenes" in Psalm 25:16 as "solitary", not "solely created".<br>  <br>  16?Turn your face to me, and show me favor;<br>  For I am solitary and afflicted.<br>  <br>  Footnote<br>  <br>  Rbi8 Psalm 25:16<br>  <br>  Or, “the only one.” Gr., mo·no·ge·nes′, “the only-begotten,” the same word as in Lu 7:12; Lu 8:42; Joh 3:16.<br>  <br>  There is nothing in the verse or in the footnote saying "solely created", that is a mistranslation if used in that verse because that would be grammatically incorrect. This is like you saying... "I am solely created and inflicted" ...this does not fit in with the grammar in that sentence. Why would anyone say they are "solely created" and then say the word "inflicted"? These two do not relate in the same sentence. You may disagree with your NWT Translation Committee of "monogenes" as "solitary" or its synonym "lonely" in Psalm 25:16 all you like, but that is not your choice as a JW to make. <br>  <br>  Question: Are you really a JW, or are you in some similar religion such as Christadelphian, Unitarian, etc...?<br>  <br>  I have read your belief writings in the past, and I see there are a few differences between your beliefs and what the JWs believe in general.|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	I'm not a JW, but I wasn't aware that there was more than one view of Jesus...

AA11297267	Here's what I'd suggest:<br>  <br>  Attending college is the best way to insure one's future career opportunities.  In addition to providing a wealth of knowledge and training, college can help a young adult become more responsible.  The rigors of college life help young adults become more independent, and can help them mature in ways they never thought possible.<br>  <br>  College is, however, becoming more expensive. While there are grants, loans and scholarships, lower tuition would allow more students to reap the benefits of a college education.  <br>  <br>  It may take quite some time for students to feel as if they're accomplishing their goals, partly because of the requirements for courses outside their major field of study, but if they stay focused they will see that a well-rounded education will pay off in the end.  College is very challenging and demanding -- it takes optimism and determination to achieve a college degree, but the final result is well worth the struggle.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps, and good luck!<br>  <br>  Peace.|`|AA11220299	You need to get rid of all the short choppy sentences. For example:<br>  "I feel that college is a necessity. It is a wonderful way to advance your career opportunities.

azazvgxIaa	The basics are no meat on Fridays or today (Ash Wednesday), give up something you enjoy, help the poor, pray the Rosary.  Most people tend to give up something and not eat meat on Fridays.  On Ash Wednesday and Good Friday (the Friday before Easter) you are supposed to fast (one modest meal and two smaller snacks not equally the quantity of meal are allowed, and water does not count).  <br>  <br>  Peace in Christ|`|AA11923447	I have a Pagan friend who faithfully observes Ash Wednesday (and certain other aspects of Lent), so there are non-Christians, and non-religious people, who do it. I know several non-Christians who attend Ash Wednesday services. Ash Wednesday is usually a fast day. Don't eat red meat (some people don't eat anything at all, or just have a small, modest meal on this day). At Ash Wednesday services, one can receive the imposition of ashes (a cross is traced on the forehead with ashes made from the palms of the previous Palm Sunday), which is a sign of the start of Lent. Otherwise, you might consider avoiding red meat on Fridays during Lent, and adopting a spiritual discipline. As their spiritual discipline, many people give up something they like, such as chocolate. Or they read more Scripture, volunteer in hosipices, nursing homes or soup kitchens, or give to the poor.|`|ewWUFWyWaa	The truth, but if you get to know the truth, the truth "shalt set thee free!" said Jesus!<br>  <br>  The only way that the Bible writers thought to pacify the whimsical sadistic God thet they came up with was by sacrificing God the Son Jesus Christ after having him beat up to a pulp to be properly tenderized and thoroughly marinated in Roman soldiers’ spit for a crucifixion number totally naked as a “spotless Lamb of God taking away the sins of the world!” There is no historical record that the Roman soldiers ever dressed any of their victim’s genital area in a white diaper before hanging them on any cross no matter how holy! In fact, there is no record that the Romans crucified anybody in Jerusalem outside of the Bible record. The Romans were known to IMPALE their victims driving a pole into their rectum and making them stand on it until after a few days later when the thick pole reached the heart or lung killing the victims by their body weight! Jesus hardly suffered a sissy’s death hanging from a nail holding him by his 2 hands. BTW, it is a SCIENTIFIC FACT that no human being can possibly be hanging any length of time by their own weight nailed to a “cross” by their hands while conducting a long conversation with his peers on the other crosses like Jesus did! Anybody with any measurable IQ can tell you that! This fact alone proves the deceitful mind of the Bible writers who invented Christianity! Spiritually speaking, of course! So how religiously primitive can you possibly get in our society today believing that the Roman soldiers would build a perfectly square and artistically looking cross for future generation of Christians to worship? Is there any thought given to the victim of any crucifixion to LOVE THE CROSS, rectum impaled pole or what have you the way Christians do? BTW, JWs are much closer to the truth about any Roman crucifixion bit. Based on historical records, they believe that Jesus was nailed to a pole instead of a cross! Nails were not manufactured that easily then to be used on common criminals. I know that Jesus was capable of pulling executive privilege, but there in no record in the Gospels that the Romans made an exception with him!  300 Years after the alleged crucifixion, Saint Helen found only 3 crosses in Jerusalem! This is a fact! Check the Early Church Father writings!<br>  <br>  Still Christians to this day delightfully snack this Jesus Christ spit flavored Meat and drink of his Holy Blood for “salvation” in the sacrament of the Holy Communion or Lord’s Supper so they can go to Heaven when they die (John 6:53). Europe is waking up out of the Dark Ages of Church domination and superstition far ahead of us here in America! I guess that religious gullibility will still be in effect until our IQ, common sense and self esteem improve to a decent level… Hey, are we still evolving or what?|`|z9st8cLvaa	Basically, you can't eat meat on Fridays (fish is okay), and typically people "give up" something for the duration of lent.  Choose something that would be a real sacrifice for you.  On the flip side, you can also commit to volunteer or provide a service to others.  Anything that you haven't been doing that would either be beneficial to yourself or your fellow man counts.|`|AA12194228	First, you would need to know why you want to do it. What your sacrifice would do for your soul. Observing lent is to meditate and deny yourself from a usual pleasure you enjoy, such a movies, TV. smoking. The money spared by your sacrifice should then be given to the Church you choose to be used in charity.|`|qSHO1wQtaa	No red meat on Fridays, don't forget to get some dirt on your forehead today, and give something up that you direly like.

By using the word god you are referring to something not human, something more than human. Whatever your idea of a god may be, human means pertaining to the human race, ie. one of us. So pretty much excludes any human from also being a god, unless you have a very unorthodox understanding of the term god.<br>  <br>  The main problem defining the term god is that most religions decide for themselves what the defnition of the word is.<br>  As you used the word "god" without a capital "G", the general consensus is that you are not acknowledging any god to be supreme or even real, but are referring to the idea of a god. So as you are not talking about one defined "God", no one can tell you anything definitive about him/it/her/them as different religions lay claim to the term "God" and are allowed give their own definition of what the god is, does, comes from, will do, etc. <br>  Whereas "god" is just a word, and is defined in the dictionary.<br>  The Buddha is supposed to have been a man, but he was never called a god. <br>  Jesus and Mohammed are agreed to have been men, and although the Christians have a nicely complicated "Jesus is part of God and God is part of Jesus" idea, Jesus is not supposed to have been a god, they are merely taking the liberty of defining what their "God" is.<br>  Jesus was human and not even the incarnation of God, rather his son.<br>  So if you will agree Jesus was not a god, you can say whatever you like about him haveing been "God" because they are different things.<br>  <br>  Oh.. and to answer your question fully..<br>  god is in Vegas all this week promoting his upcoming book and sequel to the bestselling "Ten Commandments", "The Commandements, Revised Edition for the internet age"|`|chHPoiThaa	Man invents god in his own insane image in order to cope with the insanity of it all. <br>  Life is not sane, and neither is man.<br>  Man constantly strives to  to make sense out of the insanity of it all.<br>  Man attempts to, and in some cases has to justifies his actions as a result of having to succeed at the demise of the next man.<br>  ” It all very parasites like really”<br>  There is no such thing as race or religion, that’s just man categorizing in order to recognize. <br>  Homa sapians wiped out other intelligent bipeds many thousands of years ago. <br>  What we have right now are culture clashes as a result of many mind sets being colloquial, uneducated and indoctrinated.  I.E. “Living in our own little world”  <br>  It's all still very insane as long as primitive mans ego needs to invent where he came from in order to know where he is going. never mind know what he is doing. <br>  Maybe this will always be so.  <br>  We are a perpetually, accentuating product of environmental circumstance that has no choice other than to do onto others as was done onto us without incurring some damage and knowledge upon ourselves.<br>  We learn and then perpetuate our behavior whilst exhibiting our hierarchical status, this is what we know as culture.  <br>  There is no escape and anyone at any time can become the victim, that’s if we are not all victims in the first place.

F4IjI9qaaa	Absolutely!<br>  I do not believe our souls/spirits sit idle for thousands of years waiting for judgment day. I don't think He would be so wasteful. Everything else He designed continues to serve a purpose - it's never-ending. The tree dies and becomes soil which feeds the plant. Why would His prized creation function for 70 years and then sit for thousands.<br>  <br>  I believe our souls are reincarnated into another human life and that judgment will be made on our cumulative efforts and actions. I also believe karma follows us from life to life.<br>  <br>  Reincarnation, to my way of thinking, helps explain why babies all have such different personalities. And why we inexplicably love or hate certain periods in history with regards to clothing, decorations, and cultures of the past. And why we are strongly drawn to certain places.<br>  <br>  Just because we get many lives to get it right, doesn't mean we can goof off in this one. God IS watching and we will have to reconcile our past and present lives in the next.|`|S5H0NmEWaa	Reincarnation makes no sense to me. The population of the world is increasing, so where are all the extra souls coming from? And where did they come from in the first place?<br>  <br>  Another question is whether reincarnation matters. If we have no idea that it happens during our mortal lives, how could we possibly be expected to do anything about it? What is the value of it if we don't recall earlier lifetimes? If we just live individual lives totally unaffected by the fact that we have been reincarnated and will be again, then surely it doesn't matter that we are.<br>  <br>  So no, I don't believe in it, but then I don't know for certain that I'm right. Interesting question though.|`|mNyhRGowaa	Yes till it wilts and the peddles fall off then I reincarnate with a new one.|`|WQvqLnnhaa	No....><br>  If you believe in that, who is going to judge you to determine if you got it right this time or not?|`|SWeT6MGpaa	What we essentially are is being reborn each moment.|`|7hpXsYOCaa	Nope|`|DHtCzpNUaa	Yes|`|Kp9YusZIaa	nope. its either heaven or hell|`|vPeNKLK7aa	When I was young I feared death like nearly everybody does.  At 18 I had an accident so bad that to call it extremely serious would be an understatement.  I was in a coma for some time, and, like most coma victims (I have read) awoke no longer fearing death in any way.  I then read a great deal of literature about near-death-experiences and past-life-regression and the spirit realm etc.  Reading those books was like reading an old diary of mine, though I had no recollection of that kind of thing at all, and I still haven't.  I have concluded, that this is not our actual life.  We are simply here to learn primarily through experiences.  Though getting yourself back to the spirit-realm by your own hand is the worst thing you can do: by a long way!!!  The spirit realm is our true life, this is somewhere to learn and for HIM to see your true character.  Though HIM is probably more of a council of overseers.  Religion, however, is man-made and offers guidance only; which is completely ignored by every government on the planet.  Greed is by far the worst motivation that anybody can have; and we live in a society that is dictated entirely by it.  We have possibly thousands of lives as our soul develops and increases in status within the spirit realm.  It takes a very long time and a great many lives before we progress.  So, be good to everybody and everything, forget the state enforced yearning for wealth and use your life gaining knowledge.|`|XSEWADI0aa	Does the Bible’s teaching about the soul and death allow for reincarnation?<br>  <br>  Genesis 2:7 states: “Jehovah God proceeded to form the man out of dust from the ground and to blow into his nostrils the breath of life, and the man came to be a living soul.” Notice that the man himself was the soul; the soul was not immaterial, separate and distinct from the body. “The soul that is sinning—it itself will die.” (Ezek. 18:4,?20) And a deceased person is referred to as a “dead soul.” (Num. 6:6) At death, “his spirit goes out, he goes back to his ground; in that day his thoughts do perish.” (Ps. 146:4) So when someone dies, the complete person is dead; there is nothing that remains alive and that could pass into another body. (For further details, see the main headings “Soul” and “Death.”)<br>  <br>  Eccl. 3:19: “There is an eventuality as respects the sons of mankind and an eventuality as respects the beast, and they have the same eventuality. As the one dies, so the other dies.” (As in the case of humans, nothing survives at the death of an animal. There is nothing that can experience rebirth in another body.)<br>  <br>  Eccl. 9:10: “All that your hand finds to do, do with your very power, for there is no work nor devising nor knowledge nor wisdom in Sheol, the place to which you are going.” (It is not into another body but into Sheol, the common grave of mankind, that the dead go.)|`|oJ5ztybGaa	All the way.

The only way God would forgive man his original sin was through a perfect sacrifice.  Hense His only begotten Son was born to man.  Jesus was the perfect sacrifice for man's sins.  Jesus lived a perfect life, without sin.  Satan tempted Jesus many times, but Jesus never faltered.<br>  From the moment of His birth He was sought after to be murdered, by King Herrod and alike.  Why?  Because it was said that He was King of King and Lords of Lords, and no one in power was going to have a new born child declared the Chosen one or King of Kings.  Jesus was hunted throughout His early existence, only to be given a brutal death, because He would not deny being our Messiah.  If any one of us thinks our lives have been difficult, let me tell you brothers and sisters, not one of us can stand before God, and tell Him that He could never understand how difficult our life was.  He had the most difficult life of us all!  He chose His life so that we His children could be saved!<br>  He asks nothing except that we believe in Him, and ask Him for forgiveness, and nail our sins to the cross with Him.

For, since Muhammad (PBUH) is the last and greatest of the prophets, and his religion and summons are for the whole of mankind, and since he is superior to all with regard to his miracles and religion, and acts as teacher to all mankind in all matters concerning reality, and has proved this in a brilliant manner for fourteen centuries, and is the cause of pride for mankind, a Muslim who abandons Muhammad (PBUH)’s essential training and the principles of his religion will most certainly be unable to find any light, or achieve any perfection.

I would also like to add that we should have patience to listen to other people and reply with logic and reason, instead of accusing them for not being a Muslim.<br>  <br>  1 - As far as good things in other religions are concerned, there can be two types of things that you may think are good.<br>      (a) - Things which are compatible with the teachings of Islam<br>      (b) - Things which are not compatible with the teachings of Islam<br>  <br>  So, you have the full liberty to follow all the ideas that lie under (a), but you cannot follow that lie under (b).<br>  <br>  2 - I don't think there is anything good in this world that is left out in the teachings of Islam, therefore, there is no need for a Muslim to look at different ideas of other religions to follow.<br>  <br>  3 - Who will decide what is good or bad in a particular creed or religion? We humans cannot decide because we are creation of Allah, He knows us better than us. Suppose, if a computer is malfunctioning, only the manufacturer or engineer of that computer can give the solution of the problem and repair that computer.

67e4501c0c56a505b86d4b14fc9a8330aa	Yes, I found the NY Times artile also.  Quoting from teh article:<br>  <br>  According to church teaching, even after sinners are absolved in the confessional and say their Our Fathers or Hail Marys as penance, they still face punishment after death, in Purgatory, before they can enter heaven. In exchange for certain prayers, devotions or pilgrimages in special years, a Catholic can receive an indulgence, which reduces or erases that punishment instantly, with no formal ceremony or sacrament.<br>  <br>  There are partial indulgences, which reduce purgatorial time by a certain number of days or years, and plenary indulgences, which eliminate all of it, until another sin is committed. You can get one for yourself, or for someone who is dead. You cannot buy one — the church outlawed the sale of indulgences in 1567 — but charitable contributions, combined with other acts, can help you earn one. There is a limit of one plenary indulgence per sinner per day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Notice the article says "you cannot buy one (indulgences)".|`|4807230affa1ab91b912bc7830a4b01baa	Simply incredible in the truest sense of the word...<br>  <br>  Here's the NY Times article for those who want to read it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/nyregion/10indulgence.html?ref=us" rel="nofollow">http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/nyregi...</a>|`|51fe01ef6db0c1bd743afcb3e7a2e1ffaa	sigh.. You cannot buy them. <br>  <br>  One never could "buy" indulgences. The financial scandal surrounding indulgences, the scandal that gave Martin Luther an excuse for his heterodoxy, involved alms—indulgences in which the giving of alms to some charitable fund or foundation was used as the occasion to grant the indulgence. There was no outright selling of indulgences. The Catholic Encyclopedia states: "[I]t is easy to see how abuses crept in. Among the good works which might be encouraged by being made the condition of an indulgence, almsgiving would naturally hold a conspicuous place. . . . It is well to observe that in these purposes there is nothing essentially evil. To give money to God or to the poor is a praiseworthy act, and, when it is done from right motives, it will surely not go unrewarded."<br>  <br>  The Council of Trent instituted severe reforms in the practice of granting indulgences, and, because of prior abuses, "in 1567 Pope Pius V canceled all grants of indulgences involving any fees or other financial transactions" (Catholic Encyclopedia). This act proved the Church’s seriousness about removing abuses from indulgences.<br>  <br>  The return of indulgences began with Pope John Paul II, who authorized bishops to offer them in 2000 as part of the celebration of the church's third millennium. But the offers have increased markedly under his successor, Pope Benedict, who has made plenary indulgences part of church anniversary celebrations nine times in the last three years. The current offer is tied to the yearlong celebration of St. Paul, which continues through June.<br>  <br>  Getting Catholics back into the confession booth, in fact, was one of the underlying motivations for reintroducing the indulgence. In a 2001 speech, Pope John Paul II described the newly reborn tradition as "a happy incentive" for confession.<br>  <br>  "Confessions have been down for years, and the church is very worried about it," said the Reverend Tom Reese, a Jesuit and former editor of the weekly Catholic magazine America. In a secularized culture of pop psychology and self-help, he said, "the church wants the idea of 'personal sin' back in the equation."<br>  <br>  "Indulgences are a way of reminding people of the importance of penance," he added. "The good news is we're not selling them anymore."|`|ZaSelz61aa	*sigh*<br>  <br>  This battle of Protestants and Catholics have been going eversince.

There is some confusion to one of the reasons "Almsgiving" was not considered a good way to earn an indulgence because of abuses by a particular priest that Luther was upset with.  It was certainly an abuse, but Almsgiving is a spiritual act that could be considered an act that the church could give indulgences on.   The reasons it was removed is because of the potential for abuse.  I don't know if I agree with allowing it, but it is interesting.  The current pope is used to contraversy and appears to be able to stir up contraversy so that people can ask questions.  The limitation could be lifted if the church wanted to.  I think it is similar to the Pope's recent further relaxation of celebration the "Tridentine Rite" mass.  Pope Benedict, I think, believes we have a right to it despite any whisperings.  <br>  <br>  I would like to hear more intelligent talk about these contraversies myself.  Typically, your regular press releases can contain some misconceptions.   And some bold discussion could do us some good.<br>  <br>  I have seen so many accusations on Catholic practices it really doesn't phase me.   It is wierd.  What person in their right mind would think you could buy your way into heaven or think they can worship idols.  You know its just plaster!  So you almost have to assume there is predjudice involved.  And even if you tell people what you believe, they think you are disturbed enough to not really know what you are saying.<br>  <br>  Well, if anyone (Catholics) have more info, let us know.

i7oHTo9haa	Hi.  Ignore some of your previous lame answers that say America is about freedom of religion and to just ignore his religious preference.  You're his friend and America also stands up for freedom of good righteous people to stick up for their own beliefs when they are met by aggression, even if it is from one's countrymen within.  America is under attack from within so this extends beyond religious tolerance. Since when did America's religious tolerance beliefs make one passive towards an aggressive religion?  NEVER. That is what we seceded from Britain about, so Americans could be equals on our own soil.  And that means a righteous person has every right to defend against an aggressor so just ignore the numb skulls with the lame answers above. <br>  <br>  The fanatical Muslims use our religious tolerance laws and beliefs against us, and I have no qualms as it is perfectly appropriate for you to stick up for your beliefs and fight for what you feel is right. In fact, I commend you for it.<br>  <br>  This has been a trend for Muslims purposely targeting converts in American prisons and good for you for being bothered about it.Their largest target is the Black disenfranchised American who is spiritually weak. The Christians have been stereotypically viewed as weak so if he was a lapsed Christian and feeling abused by America then he'd be easy prey for them.<br>  <br>  What you can do is to show the flip side of Christianity.  Many Christians have already shed that passive stereotype and stick up for themselves, and believe in defending freedoms.  We've got oodles of Christian troops that are kicking multiple extremist Muslim a** and it's going to continue to be that way.  Americans fight for freedom. Period.<br>  <br>  Besides breaking his stereotypical idea of Christians being weak, try to also be there spiritually for him.  Explain in equal terms that one can be a valid productive and spiritual member of American society without being hostile to America or our allies.<br>  <br>  And the other thing that you can teach him to do is how to maneuver around in society.  Some people just never learned how easy it is, get angry, then feel disenfranchised.  Typically whatever he feels disenfranchised about there is a suitable method of addressing the issue that is proactive to society and devoid of violence. The most common thing he might encounter would be a legal issue, and for that you can help him find a legal aid office to help him feel more empowered.<br>  <br>  Some links that will help educate on the hostiles within radical Islam and their intent to dominate the world.  They typically operate as a state within a state and try to take over from within.  There are currently 5million Muslims in America, 1.5 million in Britain, and 60 million in Western allied territory in Europe.  They currently "own" 60+ countries already. Their plan is to make inflammatory war with Israel and then explode simultaneously mass chaos on the rest of the West.<br>  <br>  They already rioted in Paris and shouted to riot police "get out of my occupied France!" and Britain is nearly bowing to their extremism by keeping out Geert Wilders and London police were threatened with "war, you coward!" while Malmo, Sweden has already experience "home made" rockets.  If anyone is a conscientous American that loves our freedom they will fight the incoming extremist Muslim aggression whether it radiates from foreign soil or from within.  That, is the patriotic American thing to do!!!<br>  <br>  "I warn that there should be no place on earth where terrorists can rest and train and practice their deadly skills. I meant it.

His teachings were oppressive to women (4:34, 2:223, 2:228) and disdainful of his personal enemies, the Jews (2:96, 5:13, 5:82).|`|AA10239241	Mohammad (pbuh) has no power to save a soul -- only Jesus.  Only Jesus can give Grace. What "kind" of Islam did he embrace -- radical Islam?  Extremist?

Why does anyone expect less?  Didn't the apostles tell us to count it as pure joy when we are persecuted for the sake of the name?  Again, the Grace of Jesus through His Holy Spirit will help him to endure....<br>  <br>  Pray for him.  Tell Him that Jesus was a Muslim -- of sorts.

Many groups of people form these kind of groups in prison for protection because there is strength in numbers, so they say. Anyway, Muslims with an understanding of Islam don't often find themselves in prison so the sincerity of the "Muslims" in prison is questionable since they often times get out only to go back. And lets make it clear that these "Muslims" are often Black American and not those born and raised in a Muslim country or with Muslim family. There is nothing that you can do about your friend becoming Muslim, if that's what he Truly has done. Alot of times these guys will claim Islam in prison then as soon as they get out they go back to the way they were before. Only a very few actually get out and pratice Islam and make it apart if their life. And if your friend is one of the few then be happy for him because Islam came to teach us how to live better and in peace.|`|a4crNiGdaa	that's his own Business not yours <br>  if he wants to become one then he can<br>  plus i think he made a good choice <br>  islam is a good and peaceful religion<br>  and my friends told me that if you ever dream about jesus or prophet muhammed(PBUH)<br>  or any of the other prophets then you are really seeing them<br>  and maybe what they really look like<br>  (unless you are having a dream about them in a bad way)<br>  and its true<br>  so they might of saved him for real|`|Cmj8jjLhaa	You should convert to islam to.

41ISfvXmaa	By allowing the Holy Spirit to guide you through your day everyday! Some people call this a conscience. That voice you hear that tells you that, "that's a bad choice",  "that isn't very loving", "you're being selfish" or "I shouldn't have done that"....these are all words from the holy spirit. When people listen to those words, their lives change and draws them closer to God.

Will those I work with be bad associations?<br>  <br>  As long as you are following GOD's standards of conduct, he'll approve of the work you do. those standards and principles are found in the Bible my friend.<br>  <br>  For instance:<br>  Proverbs 1:19 "Thus are the paths of everyone making unjust profit. It takes away the very soul of its owners."<br>  <br>  Proverbs 10:9 "He that is walking in integrity will walk in security, but he that is making his ways crooked will make himself known."<br>  <br>  There are vast amounts of scriptures you can consider, and should consider.

And we are talking about a country that is very tunnel vision. Abortions are illegal in that country, from what I understand (as it is in most of Latin America). <br>  <br>  So to them, they felt that it did not go to the level of putting the child's life at risk, and arbitrarily decided to terminate the lives of the twins. In their mind, it did not justify it. <br>  <br>  (I'm not saying I agree with them, I'm trying to explain their stance)<br>  <br>  Personally, as a mom of a 10 year old, I know a 9 year old is not physically capable of carrying twins to term, so the child's life was in jeopardy.

Practically speaking, though, the only difference is who has the authority to absolve, though in many places the difference is non-existent, since the bishop has authorized his priests to act in his name and lift the excommunication for abortion and grant absolution. <br>  <br>  Bottom line: both those who participate in an abortion and those who sexual abuse are barred from the sacraments until they repent. Both must seek and obtain absolution through the sacrament of confession before their good standing in the Church is restored.|`|MeFeazFiaa	The Catholic church was willing to let her risk death.

This teaching has not changed and remains unchangeable. Direct abortion, that is to say, abortion willed either as an end or a means, is gravely contrary to the moral law: <br>  <br>  You shall not kill the embryo by abortion and shall not cause the newborn to perish. <br>  <br>  God, the Lord of life, has entrusted to men the noble mission of safeguarding life, and men must carry it out in a manner worthy of themselves. Life must be protected with the utmost care from the moment of conception: abortion and infanticide are abominable crimes. <br>   <br>  2272 Formal cooperation in an abortion constitutes a grave offense. The Church attaches the canonical penalty of excommunication to this crime against human life. "A person who procures a completed abortion incurs excommunication latae sententiae," "by the very commission of the offense," and subject to the conditions provided by Canon Law. The Church does not thereby intend to restrict the scope of mercy. Rather, she makes clear the gravity of the crime committed, the irreparable harm done to the innocent who is put to death, as well as to the parents and the whole of society. <br>  <br>  2322 From its conception, the child has the right to life. Direct abortion, that is, abortion willed as an end or as a means, is a "criminal" practice (GS 27 § 3), gravely contrary to the moral law. The Church imposes the canonical penalty of excommunication for this crime against human life. <br>  <br>  2274 Since it must be treated from conception as a person, the embryo must be defended in its integrity, cared for, and healed, as far as possible, like any other human being. <br>  Prenatal diagnosis is morally licit, "if it respects the life and integrity of the embryo and the human fetus and is directed toward its safe guarding or healing as an individual. . . . It is gravely opposed to the moral law when this is done with the thought of possibly inducing an abortion, depending upon the results: a diagnosis must not be the equivalent of a death sentence."|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Good question.

mo4MnsX7aa	Several hundred years before Newton did his theoretical work, should all thinking people have rejected the truths of his work?<br>  <br>  Using your theory argument, there are several theories about God.  Just because you choose to ignore or disagree with them does not mean that all thinking people should reject His truths either.<br>  <br>  Truth does not come so easily to thinking people.  Truth only comes so easily to people who accept what others have said in blind faith.  Fortunately, as a Christian, I have no such blind faith.  It takes a person who truly understands that there are realms beyond yourself that need to be explored who find the truth.<br>  <br>  People who reject the unexplained will never be able to explain it.  They will forever fall back on specious arguments like "absence of proof is proof of absence".  They not only aren't true.  They also cause people to reject the truth when they do see it.|`|Qc6MqcpWaa	History has shown us that any well-accepted belief that is disproved will probably still be widely acknowledged for a long time regardless. People don't like when something disproves their beliefs, so they typically deny it and shun those who do not.

They just silenced those who told the public otherwise.<br>  <br>  So yes, it would only be rational to reject such a thing, except for the fact that faith often gets in the way.|`|e6t9FPUdaa	How many creationists cannot comprehend evolution?

Whoever does not have, even what he has will be taken from him. <br>  <br>   13 This is why I speak to them in parables: <br>     "Though seeing, they do not see; <br>        though hearing, they do not hear or understand. <br>  <br>  14 In them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah: <br>     " 'You will be ever hearing but never understanding; <br>        you will be ever seeing but never perceiving. <br>  <br>   15 For this people's heart has become calloused; <br>        they hardly hear with their ears, <br>        and they have closed their eyes. <br>     Otherwise they might see with their eyes, <br>        hear with their ears, <br>        understand with their hearts <br>     and turn, and I would heal them.'[a] <br>  <br>  16 But blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear. <br>  <br>  17 For I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous men longed to see what you see but did not see it, and to hear what you hear but did not hear it|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Actually I felt the entire Old Testament read more like the original Brothers Grimm with all the weird rules about sexin' and the killing and the outright cruelty inflicted by or in the name of a deity/higher power and the like.

I for one do not believe in evolution and that I derived from an ape like so very many people do and only makes sense to believe what our FATHER wrote in the Bible. <br>  <br>  I believe that all of us have to have something positive to believe in and I would rather believe in good than the evil. There are so many that will say, how can you possibly believe in something like this as there's no proof. <br>  <br>  However, I do believe that there is proof as it did come about and was written as all history books were written about FACTS. If it were never written then it would never have become an issue and followed down through time. <br>  <br>  You're not going to change peoples thoughts no matter how hard you try but stop and think about the changing times and how it was all pre-written. Next comes the mark of the beast as we are now in those times. <br>  <br>  Oh, and you might want to think about this as well. You have to have a mark or you will not be able to buy food and or anything else for survival. Money will not exchange hands and this to is already in the works and peoples paychecks are going directly to the banks.<br>  <br>  Also, we are already marked and have to be from birth as a few years back. It's your SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER. We all have to have it to do anything in this life and cannot work without supplying that number to you employers. <br>  <br>  This number will be applied to the backs of every americans hand and you will run it under a scanner in all shopping places where the money will come directly from your acct. This is coming so watch for it. It's all pre-written and I certainly believe it after these great many years of watching all foretold Bible prophecies coming into reality.<br>  <br>  I don't ask that you believe this but would like for you to watch the times and read the Idaho Observer and do some seaching there. It's quite informative.  http:/Idahoobserver.com ... I think this is right.

Don't trust talking snakes?  If God wants to kill you in a flood, you're screwed unless you're one of the few He happens to decide to stick on a bigass boat - which you'll have to build yourself?  <br>  <br>  What morals are those?<br>  <br>  I'll take Aesop over the Bible any day.

vSlG3ayiaa	Any logical argument for logic is going to be circular.  Logic isn't the sort of thing that NEEDS to be proved because logic is what you need to prove everything else.<br>  <br>  Aristotle came up with two arguments for the law of non-contradiction.<br>  <br>  1.  If the law of non-contradiction is not valid, then significant speech is not possible.<br>  2.  Significant speech is possible.<br>  3.  Therefore, the law of non-contradiction is valid.<br>  <br>  The other argument is just the same except that instead of "significant speech," you'd have "significant action."|`|DOQ4bZQuaa	I always thought that logic is how we use our reasoning. In other words, that our ability to reason, or draw conclusions, comes from our use of logic. <br>  <br>  It strikes me as circular to explain the validity of reason through reason's own faculties. How can your reason inform upon your reason?<br>  <br>  Without first having faith in your reasoning, you cannot do anything. Reason cannot prove itself. You cannot say that through your faculties, you have concluded that your faculties are sound. The insane man does not know he is insane. He believes that his faculties work fine, because the corruption of his faculties (that is his insanity) have prevented him from detecting the corruption in his faculties. One must first have faith in one's own reasoning in order for any inferences to be made. <br>  <br>  I may be entirely off the mark here.|`|tsgP2JfBaa	Appeal to Consequences is only a fallacy if one is attempting to demonstrate the "truth" of a proposition.  Not if one is simply making a case for the proposition's usefulness.<br>  <br>  Rationality is "good" because it leads to good consequences, and its alternatives don't.  But that doesn't necessarily make it "true."<br>  <br>  But then, you don't need to prove that something is true in order to construct a logical argument in favor of using it.<br>  -------------<br>  "are you not conflating logical and reasonable here?"<br>  <br>  That depends.  Do you consider logic to be inherent in ethics?  Because "good" is an ethical concept, while "true" is a logical one.  But ethics uses logic to form its premises.<br>  <br>  My argument is an ethical one - not one solely limited to formal logic.|`|NQnOw4Qbaa	I call it the bootstrap paradox:  Every logical system has to be based on assumptions that are intuitive rather than logical.  I think.<br>  <br>  Sorry about the advert in the source.  Just having a lazy Saturday.|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	If the universe is unintelligible, attempting to reason is no more meaningless than anything else. Therefore, attempting to reason on the assumption the universe is intelligible is warranted.|`|li22L9gZaa	There is also no rational justification for believing inductive reasoning (that is the past will resemble the future), because we use the past resembling the future as a basis for saying the past will resemble the future (which is circular).  However, living based on experience is of utmost importance to survival and it works (think science and technology).  There is a logical reason for believing deductive reasoning, because if the premises of the the argument are correct then the conclusion must be correct by definition. E.g. All bachelors are unmarried.  Tom is a bachelor, therefore Tom is not married.|`|QkpNt5mvaa	It is all for the reason that well all, in our respective faiths, do not ponder much. Therefore, it's been a primitive practise to consider such things as taboo in religion.<br>  <br>  Similar to your case, I also find reasoning as it is very much written in Koran to do so, but alas, most our us don't do it and keep considering it a taboo!!!<br>  <br>  You are experiencing the same thing here too.

"Is it possible to construct a [Logical].[Reasonable] argument for using [Logic].[Reason]?<br>  <br>  certainly it is reasonable to construct an argument for reason... Plato and Socrates and teachers like him used it as the foundation of all their argument.  Geometric proofs are a construct from this same idea... and that takes us back to Euclid.   so i would answer yes.<br>  <br>  it is most certainly logical to construct an argument using logic...<br>  and it is most certainly reasonable to construct an argument using reason...<br>  <br>  lawyers do it all the time... if hey!  "they are logical and reasonable" and their argument is based in Reality... not fiction.<br>  <br>  i argue that the Universe is Reasonable AND Logical or i couldn't carry on this conversation with you and other readers... however... perhaps i am just being unreasonable and illogical... <br>  <br>  but i 'doubt' it.<br>  i have 'faith' in Veritas...<br>  otherwise our life ain't worth a farthing... [consequence?]<br>  <br>  i don't know if i answered your question... i am in a hurry and this is not well thought out... it is 'off the cuff'...<br>  best wishes and warm regards... as always... <br>  <br>  your brother,<br>  sean|`|AA12165299	no...reason is based on faith and is very subjective...logic doesn't come into play with reason or rationale...they are faith based assumptions...|`|bVHnNqzBaa	Take a look at Petty & Cacioppo's research into the Need for Cognition. I think this explains your subject very well.|`|kX0T1urdaa	Isn't this an oxymoron? Logic isn't going to solve every problem. Common sense could help. Have you tried it?|`|4HClQObFaa	No.|`|yZXe2XLlaa	Well, oddly enough, it is actually logical to be irrational if your life depends on it.<br>  <br>  EDIT  I assume no such thing.<br>  I hold that it can be logical to follow an irrational thought to its conclusion if there are no rational thoughts or plans of action available when inaction would clearly be less rational in any given situation.<br>  I think the common term for my point of reference is "the fog of war"

"For all have sinned and come short of the glory of God".  This is why Jesus came...."to seek and to save that which is lost"<br>  <br>  As a person gets older, and comes to the point in their life that they know they have sinned, and that Jesus died and paid the price that God requires for sin, then they must make a decision.  Accept it, or reject it.<br>  <br>  If they accept it, they are saved by the Grace of God.  If they reject it, they continue on their course towards hell.  At some point, when they die, Christ comes back, or they have rejected the convicting of the Holy Spirit for the last time, there is no more opportunities for them to be saved.<br>  <br>  For those who are screaming about "pushing my beliefs" on you,  I have this to say.  If you don't like it, get out of the Spiritual and Religious section.  Christians have just as much right to voice our oppinions and beliefs as you do yours.  This section does not read "Yahoo non-believers" section.  If you don't believe in God and spiritual things, then stop hanging out here and doing the work of your father the devil.<br>  <br>  Joh 8:44  Ye are of your father the devil, and the lusts of your father ye will do. He was a murderer from the beginning, and abode not in the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he speaketh a lie, he speaketh of his own: for he is a liar, and the father of it.|`|baW9sSsLaa	I think that your only lost if you don't know where you are.

Every building has a builder. Everything made has a maker. The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic (self-evident). That’s why the Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’" (Psalm 14:1). The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God, and defends his belief by thinking that the question "Who made God?" can’t be answered. This, he thinks, gives him license to deny the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn’t. If there is a brick wall with "The End" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind the brick wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe (have faith) that space has no beginning and no end. The same applies with God. He has no beginning and no end. He is eternal.<br>  <br>  The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist. That will be called "eternity." God Himself dwells outside of the dimension He created (2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 1:2). He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came into being. He can move through time as a man flips through a history book.<br>  <br>  Because we live in the dimension of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end—by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrums.|`|f6743TA1aa	Because there is no proof of GOD.

The concept of the trinity has baffled many theologians throughout the ages and yes, Arius, one of many, grappled with trying to define Christ in the Godhead and his idea was that Jesus must be a lesser or created being By God the Father.  The Council of Nicea dispensed with his interpretation as heretical much like that of Modalism (Sabellianism, Marnarchianism), Adoptionism, Docetism, etc. also identified in future councils.  The early church fathers had a very difficult time dealing with Gnostics tendencies and defining how the Father, Christ, and the Spirit fit into orthodoxy Christianity was of paramount importance.  Even to this day, theological discussion looms as a backdrop when considering the Trinity because it is so difficult to define, the fact of the matter is that it defies reasoning however, when taking the new testament in context with proper hermeneutics, it is quite obvious that the begotten son is truly God incarnate.<br>  Without reiterating the already presented bible passages, my suggestion concerning how and why the trinity is defined as it is, one should look to investigating Christian history such as that presented by Philip Schaff or others. <br>  I could write a book on this subject but for this I will limit my response; it is clear to me that a full understanding of the trinity is in order and I will expand that to include the bible as a whole. It seems that you have consulted extra-biblical resources (to no avail) and yet still think that the trinity issue is unresolved.  I must warn you that pursuing JW as an alternative to orthodoxy Christianity is not a wise one.  One of many failures of other religions, is that they embrace the attempt to "work towards god", the JW believe that also.  As Luther so eloquently put it, Sola Gratia (by grace alone).  It is impossible to work your way to God except through Christ by Sola Fide (by faith alone).  All religions and I mean all religions are works based except Christianity and that includes JW as well.  My suggestion to you is read the bible for all its worth and ask God to enlighten you into is true meaning and you will find that the bible is replete with ample clarity about the Trinity just like the early father embraced.  I would also state that you P.S. confuses me, If you know the "I Am" from the new testament, you surly should have known it from the old testament; that alone should have given you a clue or maybe you haven't viewed all the scriptural references.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	If you don't see the gravity of Jesus saying "Unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins" in John 8, then look at it this way:  The Old Testament says that ONLY God is the Savior, and no other can save. <br>  <br>  Since only God can save His own creation, and Jesus is the Savior, then you must believe that Jesus is God.  <br>  <br>  You see?  :)|`|cVPq3s9zaa	The trinity are three persons that are in unity and harmony as one BEING.  The BEING is God.  The 3 persons that are in unity as that BEING are all ONE God.<br>  <br>  Think of the trinity like The Vitruvian Man by Da Vinci, only as 3 layers.   Think of the Father as "THE WILL", the Son as "THE WORD" or "THE FLESH", and the Holy Spirit as "THE SOUL".<br>  <br>  The 3 are essentially us, we have our will, our flesh, our soul...the only problem is...when it comes to man, we lack the harmony for our unity.  The 3 are in constant battle when it comes to man.<br>  <br>  GOD (3 persons in unity and harmony) made us in THEIR image and likeness.  We are made in the likeness of the the trinitarian GOD, but we are essentially defective because of the fall, and thus, flawed and imperfect and certainly not harmonious.|`|cYwmT9xPaa	Hi, I would love to answer this for you, but right now i do not have time.

It wasn't simply his disagreement with the Archbishop of Alexandria that caused his dismissmal, but of the teachings he was pushing. (Yes, JWs are Arians in their Doctrines).<br>  2) YES, you must believe that Jesus is God Eternal for salvation, because IF Jesus is NOT God, then He saved no one. The foundation of the Church is based on the Deity of Christ. <br>  Jesus was Messiah; Messiah was not simply an "anointed person" but was to be, in accordance with Scripture the Living embodiment of the Eternal God. (Isaiah 7:14 and Matthew 1:23) He is called "God with Us." Which, can be said, Literally "God Incarnate." Incarnate means “embodied in flesh, esp human form; personified or exemplified.” If something is “embodied in flesh” or physically personified and exemplified, than it is the exact representation of that which it personifies, exemplifies or embodies.<br>  The importance of “Messianic Text” in Scripture is that it is directly relevant to the establishment of the Identity of the Authentic Messiah; and relevant to the Deity of Jesus Christ. The Messiah is and was to be literally "God incarnate.”  He that was to come (scripturally) was to be the exact representation of God (The Father) and the Eternal One, personified. Messiah (mash?yach) means the “Anointed One.” Greek translation of the same Hebrew phrase is “Christ.” (christos). The Messiah (or the Christ) was to be the very embodiment of God. <br>  The reason being, is that A) Only God can Forgive Sins (Mark 2:7; Luke 5:2) B) The Sin of Adam brought a curse upon us all, therefore Original Sin passed generationally through the Flesh (Genesis 3:16-19) C) To make atonement for sins the shedding innocent of blood was required (Leviticus 17:11) because of the Law that stated "A Life for a Life" regarding atonement (Exodus 21:23-25;) Because without the shedding of blood there is no remission of sins (Hebrews 9:22). No man is without sin, Only God is sinless. (1 John 1:8; Rom 3:23; Numb 23:19; Heb 4:15 etc)<br>  So, based on the requirements for atonement, (OT Law) and innocent life had to be exchanged for the life of the Guilty in order that the Law be fulfilled and atonement for the sinner, accomplished. But because Man sinned in the Flesh, the final atonement had to be in a body of Flesh, not an animal.<br>  Therefore Christ, was the final such atonement: His Life for Our Lives; His Innocence (he was without sin) For Our Guilt. His Blood Shed in accordance with the Law, to make atonement for our Sins. Since He was God Eternal, He could accomplish this. <br>  Therefore, IF Christ is NOT God, then He is NOT Messiah. IF He is not Messiah, than He saved no one and we are ALL in some trouble.<br>  <br>  The Doctrine and Creed (of which you are referencing) was not pulled out of the air, there was a reason that Arius was condemened. In teaching that Jesus was created (and God's Firstborn among creation) is to say that He was not Divine in the sense of BEING GOD. Jesus was both Fully Divine and Yet Fully Human. <br>  3) A Trinity, is not the same thing as a Triad. <br>  A Trinity is,“any union of three parts or elements in one.” A Triad is “a group of three persons or things” <br>  <br>  And Jesus DID claim to be God, more than once. (In claiming to be "The Son of God" or "Messiah" He was claiming to be the Eternal G-D incarnate, as that is what Scripture says.<br>  In John 10:30 where he says, "I and the Father are One." he was building upon the Shema, Deuteronomy 6:4. “Shema Yisrael Adonai Eloheinu, Adonai Echad.”  i.e, “Listen, Israel: The Eternal is our God, the Eternal one alone!”  OR “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, The Lord is one.” (NIV) echad (’echad) = one. (united, i.e, one; first, alike, alone, altogether; a numeral from ’ached which means “to unify”;) “Echad (’echad) speaks of a compound or collective unity which comprises more than one person, i.e, one crowd, one people, one nation.  So, essentially, Jesus was saying "I AM GOD ETERNAL" because in claiming Oneness with the Father, He was claiming Eternal Divinity.<br>  JWs often debate this, (John 10:30) taking the position of Arius (since they follow his teachings) BUT the proof comes not in that isolated verse of 30, but in the preceeding and succeeding verses. In 10:33, The Religious People made quite clear that they were trying to stone him because He claimed to be God. i.e, "We are not stoning you for any of these," replied the Jews, "but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, claim to be God."  Therefore it is clear that Jesus' statements of "I and the Father are One" was a direct claim to His being the Eternal I AM. <br>  <br>  In any case, I am running out of space, but i could add SO MUCH more to this.  Essentially, The Trinity is Scriptural and thus why it was formulated into a Doctrine of the Chuch; Arius taught hereseis, such was his condemnation. To be "saved" One MUST believe that Jesus is God, otherwise his faith is in vain; Only God Eternal can save, and only God Eternal can Forgive Sins.<br>  Hope this Helps xoxo ?<br>  <br>  PS: While it is True that the word “Trinity” does not appear in the Bible, the word “Godhead” does. (Acts 17:29; Romans 1:20; Colossians 2:9 KJV). The term “Godhead” is in reference to the Triune nature of the Almighty, His being Three-in-One as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, in One Divine Being; (i.e., a trinity) and not three separate gods (i.e., a triad). It, the word “godhead” means “divine nature or being; divinity.” Colossians 2:9 (KJV) “For in him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.” So essentially, Jesus was "the fullness of the Godhead bodily" hence the incarnation of the Eternal One.<br>  <br>  IT is NOT from one or two isolated verses that the Doctrine (of the Trinity) was Established; but from a thorough overview of Scripture as a whole:<br>  There is only One God: Deut 6:4, Isaiah 43:10, 44:6-8; <br>  Trinity in O.T: Gen 1:26-27; Isaiah 6:1-10,  61:1- 10    48:12,16; Zech 2:10-11; <br>  The Father is God: 1 Peter 1:17; John 5:17-23;<br>  The Son is Called God: (explicitly) Matt 1:23; John 1:1,14, 5:17-23, 8:53-59 along with Ex 3:1-15; John 10:28-33, 20:28; Rom 9:5;Col 2:9; Titus 2:13; Heb 1:8; 1 John 5:20; (as in terms descriptive and reserved for the Almighty alone: (creator:) John 1:3, Eph 3:9; Col 1:16,17; Heb 2:10; Rev 3:14; (almighty:) Rev 1:8 with 21:5-7 and 22:12,13, 16,20; (first and the last:) Rev 1:17, 2:8, 22:13 cross-reference Isaiah 44:6; (representation of the Father:) Heb 1:3; John 12:45 and 14:6-11; Isaiah 46:9; (worshipped as God:) Luke 4:8; Rev 5:11-13 with 4:9-11; Heb 1:6;<br>  The Holy Spirit is God: (called God:) Act 5:3,4; 2 Cor 3:17 compare with Ex 34:29-35; (is omnipotent:) Isaiah 40:12-14 with Rom 11:34 and 1 Cor 2:16; (is omniscient:) 1 Cor 2:10,11; Isaiah 40:13,14; (is omnipresent:) Psalm 139:7; (is eternal:) Heb 9:14; (has attribute of personality:) (intellect:) Rom 8:27; 1 Cor 2:10-12; (has a will:) 1 Cor 12:11; (emotion:) Eph 4:30; (self-cognizance demonstrated by actions:) (speaks:) Acts 8:29, 10:19, 13:2; 21:11; Rev 2:7,11,17,29, 3:6,13,22; (teaches:) Luke 12:12; John 14:26; 1 John 2:26,27; (says “I”:) Acts 10:20;|`|xyIZv6iiaa	Acts 17: 29<br>  Rom. 1: 20<br>  Col. 2: 9<br>  <br>  Godhead - mentioned in the bible is the idea of The Father, The Son , and The Holy Ghost - three seperate entities united in cause, intent, and purpose.<br>  <br>  Trinity is a philosophical construct of the Nicene Creed. <br>  <br>  When given the choice, do you choose scripture or man?|`|AA11616515	Check this site out it supports what you are saying <br>  Disregard the name, as today’s vernacular denotes negative connotations ..just read what they post.   <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblicalunitarian.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblicalunitarian.com/</a>|`|XN0cYCATaa	The Trinity<br>  God is a trinity of persons: the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Father is not the same person as the Son; the Son is not the same person as the Holy Spirit; and the Holy Spirit is not the same person as Father. They are not three gods and not three beings. They are three distinct persons; yet, they are all the one God. Each has a will, can speak, can love, etc., and these are demonstrations of personhood. They are in absolute perfect harmony consisting of one substance. They are coeternal, coequal, and copowerful. If any one of the three were removed, there would be no God.|`|dNSvlc6caa	I commend you on your effort to learn about your faith - many people I know do not make such an effort.  The man who fought against the Arian heresy (as the Church called it) was named Athanasius.<br>  <br>  I agree, there are many passages that seem to say that Jesus was not God, or was less than God.  Arius (I think) believed that Jesus was less than God because Jesus proceeded from the Father - there was a time when the Son did not exist.  It seems logical I suppose.  <br>  <br>  But then, trinitarian Christians will point out that Jesus forgave sins, and the only person who can do that is God, so in that way Jesus was claiming to be God.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, salvation would not require people to believe Jesus was God.  You could say that Jesus is the only way to get to God, but that's not the same as saying  he IS God.  Jesus said, "I am the way, the truth, and the light, no one comes to the Father but through me." To me, this statement does not say that Jesus is saying he's God. It's saying that Jesus is the only way to God.  I think as long as you believe that, then you can be considered Christian. You said that you believe Jesus was the Messiah, and that he died for our sins; in my opinion, you are a Christian.|`|mrzeXJ6Eaa	Does salvation even require us to believe Jesus is God?<br>  <br>  John 8:24  I told you that you would die in your sins; if you do not believe that I am the one I claim to be, you will indeed die in your sins."<br>  <br>  It is vital to know who Jesus is and not follow a "false Christ". I'm glad you are sincerely looking into it.<br>  <br>  Here is one that you might have missed:<br>  <br>  The high priest knew this passage that said the one coming on the clouds would be worshiped by all nations. <br>  Daniel 7:13-14  "In my vision at night I looked, and there before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient of Days and was led into his presence.  (14)  He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion that will not pass away, and his kingdom is one that will never be destroyed.<br>  <br>  Here we both see Jesus hinting at the "I AM" reference as well as blatantly stating Daniel 7 is about Him. Combining Daniel 7 with Psalms 110 and it was total blasphemy if Christ was not who He claimed to be.<br>  Mark 14:61-63  But Jesus remained silent and gave no answer. Again the high priest asked him, "Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed One?"  (62)  "I am," said Jesus. "And you will see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of the Mighty One and coming on the clouds of heaven." (63)  The high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we need any more witnesses?" he asked.<br>  <br>  Furthermore, Jesus demonstrated omniscience (Matthew 26:34), declared omnipotence by raising the dead (John 11:43) and raising himself from the dead (John 2:19) and professed omnipresence by promising He would be with his disciples to the very end of the age(Matthew 28:20). He forgave sins that only God can do and accepted worship.

NZ0mRaG3aa	I don't think the strict hierarchical control of the sort espoused by the Papacy was intended by Christ. St Peter was only one of many leaders in the early church. He was one of the 3 in charge at Jerusalem initially. But he and James the Lord's brother(the spokesperson of the Jerusalem church it would seem in the 40s) and John recognised Paul's separate calling and authority; and the other apostles would be off establishing new churches, such as Thomas in India. Peter was later bishop of the Rome church. But after he died, John over at Ephesus would be most highly reputed.

Had catholicism existed during the time of Acts, the first Christians would have rejected catholicism completely. <br>  <br>  Also there's a long list of Christians that called the "pope" the antichrist, and who also completely rejected catholicism, long before Martin Luther was even born.<br>  <br>  So not only is it false to say that "catholics were the first Christians", but this list blows away the catholic claim that "no churches existed other than the catholic church, until Martin Luther". <br>  <br>  There were always saved believers outside the catholic cult, who knew catholicism cannot save anyone.|`|4JKeZmdlaa	Mien Fuhrer CJ/Chris who was it in acts taht said this<br>  <br>  Evodius was the first Bishop of Antioch a Catholic, and he is credited with being the first person to call the followers of Christ, "Christians", as shown in Acts 11:26.

AA11232725	I say that similarities don't prove a common ancestor.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/k94.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.biblestudymanuals.net/k94.htm</a><br>  <br>  We're often pointed to the blood serum similarities between the chimpanzee and the human... But if we compare milk chemistry instead of blood serum, it's not the chimpanzee that's the closest [to human's]... it's the donkey that has milk chemistry almost exactly like mother's milk... We see distinct similarity with the garter snake [relative to cholesterol]... Likewise, foot structure: the closest [to humans] is the glacial bear, not the chimpanzee, not the ape... Regarding [the] tear enzyme, we find [that] the chicken has the same chemistry in the egg to kill bacteria that we have in our eyes to kill bacteria. When it comes to blood antigen A... the butterbean [is most similar to humans]... The cockroach [has a similar] brain hormone... Notice a statement that appeared in DISCOVER MAGAZINE, the year before last. It says... the cockroach and man... shares a common brain hormone...<br>  <br>  Well, what we're pointing out here are the variations on a theme. And the similarities that we see are not similarities developed gradually and branch outward that would explain... common ancestors but [these similarities instead are] randomly spaced throughout the animal kingdom: one Antigen A in the butterbean and us, cholesterol in us and also in the garter snake, and similar blood serum with the chimpanzee. But what we're seeing is not this gradual developing, branching pattern; but rather what we're seeing is the mosaic - like the artist who puts the blue tile here when he needs it and puts the blue tile there when he needs it, randomly dispersed for similar functions throughout the living world. Now that is the picture that's seen when we look at similarities. They don't come from common genetic origin... They don't fit the branching pattern...

However, new evidence suggests that the difference might be much more drastic. Mutations resulting in DNA insertions and deletions cause much of the genetic difference between the two species, but are typically not included in estimates of diversity. Moreover, areas of significant similarity are often affected by selective constraints. An increasing number of functions are also being discovered for so-called ‘junk DNA’, suggesting similarity in such DNA is not necessarily due to common descent. Additional research should aid the understanding of such important data in the debate over origins.<br>  <br>  Creationists have long maintained that the similarity between human and chimp DNA is not all that it is touted to be. A new study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences could help confirm this.<br>  <br>  It is widely held that ‘The common chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes) is our closest relative. Its genome sequence is about 98.8% identical to our own, and we shared a common ancestor some six million years ago.’1 The assumption that humans diverged from chimps roughly this long ago also forms the basis of the mitochondrial clock,2 which ‘continues to be widely used to “time” human evolution and population movements, both ancient and modern.’3 In the popular-level book Genome, Matt Ridley states that:<br>  <br>  ‘Apart from the fusion of chromosome 2, visible differences between chimp and human chromosomes are few and tiny. In thirteen chromosomes no visible differences of any kind exist. If you select at random any “paragraph” in the chimp genome and compare it with the comparable “paragraph” in the human genome, you will find very few “letters” are different: on average, less than two in every hundred. We are, to a ninety-eight per cent approximation, chimpanzees, and they are, with ninety-eight per cent confidence limits, human beings. If that does not dent your self-esteem, consider that chimpanzees are only ninety-seven per cent gorillas; and humans are also ninety-seven per cent gorillas. In other words we are more chimpanzee-like than gorillas are.’4<br>  <br>  One creationist response to such arguments regarding human/chimp DNA similarity has been that ‘Chimp DNA has not been anywhere near fully sequenced so that a proper comparison can be made’,5 and that this evidence is just as easily explained (and predicted, for that matter) by the concept of a common designer:<br>  <br>  ‘Since DNA codes for structures and biochemical molecules, we should expect the most similar creatures to have the most similar DNA. Apes and humans are both mammals, with similar shapes, so both have similar DNA. We should expect humans to have more DNA similarities with another mammal like a pig than with a reptile like a rattlesnake. And this is so. Humans are very different from yeast but they have some biochemistry in common, so we should expect human DNA to differ more from yeast DNA than from ape DNA.’6<br>  <br>  In a recent article,7 David A. DeWitt cited a study which found that the two species are only 95% identical when insertions and deletions are considered,8 showing that the estimate of divergence depends mainly on what type of DNA is being compared. A number of differences between humans and chimps were named that are difficult to quantify in an estimate of sequence divergence (that is, the differences in bases between the human and chimp genomes), including shorter telomeres in humans, a 10% larger chimp genome, and great differences in chromosomes 4, 9, 12 and the Y chromosome, for example. Indeed, DNA similarity estimates ‘do not adequately represent fine changes in genome organization.’9<br>  <br>  Considering DNA gaps<br>  Previous estimates of sequence divergence have focused exclusively on base substitutions in DNA—that is, one base (or one DNA ‘letter’—A, T, C or G) being replaced with another. The new calculation, resulting in much less sequence similarity, also includes insertions and deletions, or indels, (occurring when a base is added or removed, often resulting in what is known as a frameshift mutation), in addition to base substitutions. The author of the study, Roy J. Britten, stated:<br>  <br>  ‘It appears appropriate to me to consider the full length of the gaps in estimating the interspecies divergence. These stretches of DNA are actually absent from one and present in the other genome. In the past, indels have often simply been counted regardless of length and added to the base substitution count, because that is convenient for phylogenetics.’8<br>  <br>  His findings lend support to the idea that much of the failure of DNA to hybridize between chimps and humans is the result of missing DNA due to indel events. Britten then became involved in a follow-up paper in which these initial results were confirmed; in fact, it was found that ‘the 5% human-chimp dif|`|mggFgqFPaa	Ah, Noki the blurter, you are certainly qualified to be the spokesman of the atheist apes, but for those of us descended from Adam, we're just thankful you're not the voice of us humans.

I will give some passing references to the verses of Bible to think about:<br>  <br>  1) Jesus went to mountain to worship! Who is he worshiping if he himself is God?<br>  <br>  2) Devil raises Jesus very high in sky, shows him all the kingdoms of earth and says if Jesus obeys him all kingdoms will be given to Jesus!<br>  Can Devil say this to God?<br>  <br>  3) Jesus comes to his disciples and asks them for food; they give him fish and honey! Does God requires sustenance?<br>  <br>  4) Jesus on cross cries out: "Eli Eli la ma sabachtani" (O God! O God! Why have you forsaken me?)! Can these words be said by God?<br>  <br>  5) When Jesus returns after being crucified (as per Bible), his disciples are astonished and are in a state of disbelief! Did his disciples considered him to be God? If so then why were they amazed when he came back?<br>  <br>  6) Does God dies? If not then how can he be crucified?<br>  <br>  Does not all this indicate that there is something which has gone wrong after Jesus Christ (may peace and blessings be upon him) left?<br>  Is it not that the original message preached by Jesus is not same as that preached by Church today? <br>  <br>  It is true that Jesus Christ (may peace and blessings be upon him) was a human being who conveyed the message of God, just like other Prophets and Messengers of God have done. To raise him to divinity and say that he was "Son of God or God Himself", is not only incorrect but also a great lie against God Himself! God says regarding this, saying:<br>  <br>  "And they say: "The Most Beneficent (God Almighty) has begotten a son."<br>  <br>  Indeed you have brought forth (said) a terrible evil thing. <br>  <br>  Whereby the heavens are almost torn, and the earth is split asunder, and the mountains fall in ruins,<br>  <br>  That they ascribe a son (or offspring or children) to the Most Beneficent (God Almighty). <br>  <br>  But it is not suitable for (the Majesty of) the Most Beneficent (God Almighty) that He should beget a son (or offspring or children)<br>  <br>  There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most Beneficent (God Almighty) as a slave."<br>  (Qur'an 19:88-93)<br>  <br>  In fact Jesus never claimed divinity for himself or called people to worship him! On the contrary he called people to worship One True God, without associating anyone with Him in worship, be it a Prophet, Angel or anything else:<br>  <br>  "Surely, they have disbelieved (in God) who say: "God is the Messiah (Jesus)." But the Messiah (Jesus) said: "O Children of Israel! Worship God, my Lord and your Lord." Verily, whosoever sets up partners in worship with God, then God has forbidden Paradise for him, and the Fire will be his abode. And for the 'polytheists and wrong-doers' there are no helpers (to save from punishment of God)." (Qur'an 5:72) <br>  <br>  God also addresses people regarding the concept of Trinity, saying:<br>  <br>  "O people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in your religion, nor say about God anything except the truth. The Messiah (Jesus), son of Mary, was (no more than) a Messenger of God and His Word, ("Be!" - and he was) which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit created by Him; so believe in God Almighty and His Messengers. Say not: "Three (trinity)!" Cease! (it is) better for you. For God Almighty is (the only) One God, Glory be to Him (Far Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him belongs all that is in the heavens and all that is in the earth. And God Almighty is All-Sufficient as a Disposer of affairs." (Qur'an 4:171) <br>  <br>  <br>  Jesus said: "And verily God is my Lord and your Lord. So worship Him (Alone). That is the Straight Path. (God's Religion of Islamic Monotheism which He did ordain for all of His Prophets)." <br>  (Qur'an 19:30-36)<br>  <br>  This is the true message of Christ, and it is necessary for one who wants to succede and be guided aright to embrace it.|`|hIdVdd28aa	First of all we should be clear about who GOD is.<br>  There is an expansion for the term GOD.<br>  G stand for the Generator ( Is it that for  Generator of all creture , etc -Living and non living-Organic and in organic matters and so on ...).<br>  O stand for Operator and the D stand for the Destroyer.<br>  <br>  So is it not GOD is nothing but the nature.<br>  <br>  Who created our body -Our parrents.<br>  Who maiatined  ( operated )us - Our parrents and the soicienty-Society in the form of Dr., Nurses, the builder who buits the hospital, the manufactrer who gave u the medine; the former who gave us the food, the engineer who gave us the roads and buildings, machines and motors cars and so onn).<br>  Who destroyed us- When we bocome (grow ) , etreamly old is it not better that we die .

But the Father is not the Son or the Holy Spirit.  Together the three from a single "God".|`|ZDDya5Ibaa	The whole idea is that Jesus is the human incarnate of God. He was God in the human form.

RgceFQ9Caa	The concept of a Good Friday crucifixion and a Sunday morning resurrection is a complete falsehood that has led to the deception of those who would be followers of the Christ for centuries. It is one of the traditions of men that we are warned against following. Christians should celebrate Passover as did our Savior.<br>  <br>  The truth is that the resurrection was near the end of the weekly 7th day Sabbath (our Saturday) exactly 72 hours after He was placed in the tomb. Anyone who tells you anything else is calling Christ a liar. If it was NOT 72 hours, then He is NOT your Savior. The only sign that He gave that proves His identity is Matthew 12:40. Three days and three nights cannot possibly fit into Friday evening to before sunrise Sunday. You cannot even count, if you believe in a Friday crucifixion, Sunday as a day because the scriptures say He was already risen BEFORE the women got to the tomb and that it was still dark.<br>  <br>  Several links where you can study the truth for yourself:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw..." rel="nofollow">http://www.tomorrowsworld.org/cgi-bin/tw...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucg.org/booklets/JC/</a><br>  <br>  To truly understand what went on during the week of the crucifixion, you need to study the Biblical Holy Days:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_..." rel="nofollow">http://media.pcog.org/en/Literature/PAG_...</a><br>  <br>  To give you a basic overview, because you really need to study this vital truth for yourself, in the Bible, the days start and end at sunset:<br>  <br>  Crucifixion week:<br>  <br>  Our Tuesday evening (Sunset started the 14th day of Exodus 10-12) Yeshua ate the Passover with His disciples and instituted the bread and wine ceremony as a memorial to His death. That night He was betrayed, arrested, taken to the High Priest's house. The next morning (our Wednesday) very early before the morning sacrifices began at the Temple, He was taken to the Sanhedrin. Peter denied Him, most likely about the time the Temple Crier (Not a rooster) was calling for the morning sacrifices to begin. <br>  <br>  After being shuttled back and forth between Herod and Pilate, He is finally condemned, tortured, and crucified and died on the cross late Wednesday afternoon and was placed in the tomb before the sunset that ended that day. This was the preparation day for the 1st High Sabbath of the year, the first day of Unleavened Bread (Again read the Exodus account and Leviticus 23).<br>  <br>  This period of time from sunrise Wednesday to sunset Wednesday is also the preparation day for the High day Sabbath mentioned in John's account.<br>  <br>  Night 1<br>  Sunset Wednesday to Sunrise Thursday. The High Day Sabbath, the first day of Unleavened Bread, or the Passover of the Jews, mentioned in John's account (19:31) began at this sunset<br>  <br>  Day1<br>  Sunrise Thursday to sunset Thursday. It is still the High day Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Night 2<br>  Sunset Thursday to sunrise Friday began the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath.<br>  <br>  Day 2<br>  Sunrise Friday to sunset Friday. This is the daytime portion of the preparation day for the weekly Sabbath, during which the disciple prepared the spices for the final burial of Yeshua.<br>  <br>  Night 3<br>  Sunset Friday to sunrise Saturday, the weekly Sabbath began at sunset Friday and the disciples rested according to the commandment.<br>  <br>  Day 3<br>  <br>  Sunrise Saturday (Sabbath)to just before sunset Saturday (Sabbath), 72 hours after being placed in the grave before the first Holy Day ends the 3rd day. <br>  <br>  This is so easily proven from the Bible that it is ridiculous that people still believe in a Good Friday/Easter Sunday scenario. Like so many other practices and beliefs of traditional Christianity, it is rooted in pagan worship of heathen gods and has no Biblical basis whatsoever.<br>  <br>  Bottom line;  Which do we love more, God and the truth or the false traditions of man?<br>  <br>  Edit: I guess we may as well throw out Matthew 12:40, the only sign the Messiah Himself stated would prove His Messiahship.   How can one possibly take this out of context?<br>  <br>  Matthew 12:38   Then some of the scribes and Pharisees, hearing this, said to him, Master, we are looking for a sign from you.  39  But he, answering, said to them, An evil and false generation is looking for a sign; and no sign will be given to it but the sign of the prophet Jonah:<br>  40  For as Jonah was three days and three nights in the stomach of the great fish, so will the Son of man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth.|`|2a93295e665a94d49d03426e34243078aa	????????Those who try to use Matthew 12:40 as proof for anything, are ignoring 13 other statements to the contrary -- including the entire symbolic service, the giving of the Manna, and prophecy, combined, which says otherwise (Hosea 6:1-3; Mat. 16:21; 17:23; 20:19; 27:64; Mark 9:31; 10:34; Luke 9:22; 18:33; 24:7; 24:46; Acts 10:40; 1Cor. 15:4).  But I won't bother relating how Matthew 12:40 is used completely out of context.  That is not what you asked.<br>  <br>  ????????So, when did Jesus Christ Resurrect from the tomb?  He resurrected just before dawn, just moments before Mary reached the tomb, on a Sunday morning which was the third day from Passover, the Day of the First Fruits, and the Day of the Wave Sheaf (Mat 28:1-4).  Good Friday and Easter DO NOT EVER coincide with Passover and the Feast of the Wave Sheaf.<br>  <br>  ● The symbolic services pointed to this third-day resurrection for more than 1,000 years before Jesus Christ was born (Lev. 7:16-18; Lev. 19:5-7).<br>  ● The Manna given on Friday morning was collected that morning (just as Jesus was Crucified that morning; Exo. 16:22,23), was not given on Sabbath morning (just as Jesus rested in the tomb on Sabbath; Exo. 16:24-31), and was given again on Sunday morning just before the dawn (just as Jesus Resurrected on Sunday morning just before the dawn; Num. 11:9).<br>  ● The prophet Hosea also said that Jesus Christ would resurrect on the third day (Hosea 6:1-3).<br>  <br>  ????????Further, Jesus Christ became the Anti-typical First Fruits on the Day of the typical First Fruits (Lev. 23:10,11; 1Cor. 15:20).  He, also, collected His own Wave Sheaf to present before His Father.  You see, the typical wave sheaf was marked in the field on Passover afternoon, but not actually cut until early the morning of the Wave Sheaf -- just as the saints graves were marked on Friday afternoon at Jesus' death, but didn't actually come out of their graves until Jesus' resurrected (Mat. 27:50-53).<br>  <br>  ????????Thus, that selfsame day, the Day of the typical Wave Sheaf, He presented His Anti-typical Wave Sheaf before His Father's Throne at the time of the morning sacrifice when the earthly wave sheaf was normally offered by a Levite High Priest before the Lord in the earthly sanctuary.  Jesus Christ, though, did this in the Heavenly Sanctuary where His Father's Throne is located.  This is also why, on Sunday morning, He told Mary not to touch Him, for He had not yet ascended unto His Father (John 20:17) -- while at the same time, later that Sunday evening, He appeared before His disciples, in the upper room, and told them to touch Him and handle Him in order to prove to them that He was not a spirit (Luke 24:33-43).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090305200320AAQqGg7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  God bless.|`|RCqG4z5Oaa	Matthew 27:62-64.

NEkssyeAaa	Many people did know how Jesus looked like. DO you want to know how?<br>  The followers of Jesus and the Romans and Jews who were agaisnt Jesus all saw Jesus. <br>  At that time having a beard was very common, they dotn know exactley how he looked like but can assume.<br>  <br>  The concept of Jesus being white was made in Europian Churches, he defnitley wasnt white. How can he be white when he was in middle east. Its not snowing there or raining. Its always continues hot. He wasnt black even as some people say. He was tanned.<br>  <br>  So there was concept of Jesus image. In Christianity it is allowed to show Jesus, In Islam they are not allowed to draw or have any type of painting of Jesus or any holy prophet.<br>  <br>  <br>  There are actually images of God. Very famous painting by Michaelangeelo of the Sistine-Chapel. Michaelngalo made GOd like a old man with muscles, wearign a robe with a big beard. This is how some people see God, that he is a man and is old. This is some type of image people see. He is not a he or a she. In chrisitanity they use the term father. In the bible it sometime does say he to refer to God as him. This is just to create a sentance and understanding for the reader not for reference that God is a male. If this is the case then where is the mother?<br>  God cannot be drawn, reason is nobody knows how God looks like. We can only imagine light.

Each one of us is in need of a savior for our sins.<br>  Romans 3:10-11<br>  <br>  Jesus Himself says in Mark 9:<br>  Mark 9:43-44 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter into life maimed, rather than having two hands, to go to hell, into the fire that shall never be quenched— 44 where <br>  ‘ Their worm does not die And the fire is not quenched.’[a]<br>  <br>  Matthew 8:11-12 And I say to you that many will come from east and west, and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven. 12 But the sons of the kingdom will be cast out into outer darkness.

If you believe the Bible it says that hell is a place of torment and a literal burning flame. Only those that belong to God will not go there, regardless of how bad or good you are.

That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!|`|pj2bnJgjaa	The existence of hell and the surety of the judgment are not the claims of fallible man. The Bible is the source of the claim, and it is utterly infallible. When someone becomes a Christian, he is admitting that he was in the wrong, and that God is justified in His declarations that we have sinned against Him.<br>  <br>  However, let’s surmise for a moment that there is no Judgment Day and no hell. That would mean that the Bible is a huge hoax, in which more than forty authors collaborated (over a period of 3,000 years) to produce a document revealing God’s character as "just." They portrayed Him as a just judge, who warned that He would eventually punish murderers, rapists, liars, thieves, adulterers, etc. Each of those writers (who professed to be godly) therefore bore false witness, transgressing the very commandments they claimed to be true.<br>  <br>  It would mean that Jesus Christ was a liar, and that all the claims He made about the reality of judgment were there-fore false. It would also mean that He gave His life in vain, as did multitudes of martyrs who have given their lives for the cause of Christ. Add to that the thought that if there is no ultimate justice, it means that the Creator of all things is unjust—that He sees murder and rape and couldn’t care less, making Him worse than a corrupt human judge who refuses to bring criminals to justice.<br>  <br>  Here’s the good news, though, if there is no hell: You won’t know a thing after you die. It will be the end. No heaven, no hell. Just nothing. You won’t even realize that it’s good news.<br>  <br>  Here’s the bad news if the Bible is right and that there is eternal justice: You will find yourself standing before the judgment throne of a holy God, who has seen every sin you have ever committed. Think of it. A holy and perfect Creator has seen your thought-life and every secret sin you have ever committed. You have a multitude of sins, and God must by nature carry out justice. Ask Him to remind you of the sins of your youth. Ask Him to bring to remembrance your secret sexual sins, the lies, the gossip, and other idle words. You may have forgotten your past sins, but God hasn’t. Hell will be your just desert (exactly what you deserve), and you will have no one to blame but yourself. This is the claim of the Bible. If you don’t believe it, it is still true. It will still happen.<br>  <br>  Yet, there is good news—incredibly good news. We deserve judgment, but God offers us mercy through the cross. He paid our fine so that we could leave the courtroom. He destroyed the power of the grave for all who obey Him. Simply obey the gospel, and live. By doing that you will find out for yourself that the gospel is indeed the "gospel truth." Jesus said that if you obey Him, you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free (see John 8:31,32).<br>  <br>  Get on your knees today, confess and forsake your sins. Tell God you are truly sorry, then trust the Savior as you would trust yourself to a parachute. Then you will find yourself in a terrible dilemma. You will know for certain that hell is a reality. When you get up the courage to warn people you care about, they will smile passively, and say, "Could you be wrong in your claims about Judgment Day and the existence of hell?"|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Hell is here on earth.I have seen people suffer so much that death is a release from pain.Hell is around us as we write on answers.

They can even hear the gospel preached to them and receive at least the sacrament of baptism (but if they purposely rejected God or his church in this life, they might not have quite the same menu of rewards that other people do).  <br>  <br>  Note that Hell is destroyed by the atonement just the same way that death is destroyed by the resurrection.  Hell must give up its captive spirits just like the grave and the sea must give up their captive bodies (I prefer not to speculate about people who were eaten) so we can be arraigned and judged for our deeds.<br>  <br>  In the final analysis, Hell is the least convenient way for us to be purified from sin so we can receive some kind of a glorious reward.  Paul spoke of three heavens awaiting people who receive the Celestial resurrection; a Terrestrial resurrection, which logically must have at least one glorious reward in it; and a type of resurrection that is not named in the Bible ["Telestial" in Latter-day Saint scriptures] but also must have some kind of a glorious reward.<br>  Sun > Moon > Stars > Darkness<br>  Celestial > Terrestrial > [Telestial] > Outer Darkness<br>  <br>  My church just happens to teach that the people rescued from hell will receive that "starlight" [Telestial] resurrection and reward.  It's better than Hell, at any rate, and infinitely better than Outer Darkness.<br>  <br>  Practically nobody is going to suffer forever, and the ones who do -- the Sons of Perdition -- will suffer not necessarily as a punishment, and certainly not because God wants it, but because they have cut themselves off completely from the source of life and happiness.  But don't worry, you have nothing to fear about this.  You'd have to know for a surety that Jesus is the son of God, feel his boundless love, and then completely and totally turn against him (out Judasing Judas, almost) to qualify for that.  (By the way, this proves that the average atheist is not going to become a son of Perdition.)|`|9btru19waa	Pay close attention to Luke 16:24 and Revelations 20:10 & 15, then you will have no doubt that there really is an eternal hell.<br>  <br>  Luk 16:19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed and who lived each day in luxury.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:20 At his door lay a diseased beggar named Lazarus.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:21 As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:22 Finally, the beggar died and was carried by the angels to be with Abraham. [fn] The rich man also died and was buried,  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:23 and his soul went to the place of the dead. [fn] There, in torment, he saw Lazarus in the far distance with Abraham.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:24 "The rich man shouted, `Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue, because I am in anguish in these flames.'  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:25 "But Abraham said to him, `Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:26 And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. Anyone who wanted to cross over to you from here is stopped at its edge, and no one there can cross over to us.'  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:27 "Then the rich man said, `Please, Father Abraham, send him to my father's home.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:28 For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them about this place of torment so they won't have to come here when they die.'  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:29 "But Abraham said, `Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read their writings anytime they want to.'  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:30 "The rich man replied, `No, Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead, then they will turn from their sins.'  <br>  <br>  <br>   Luk 16:31 "But Abraham said, `If they won't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even if someone rises from the dead.' "  <br>  <br>  Rev 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who did mighty miracles on behalf of the beast--miracles that deceived all who had accepted the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue. Both the beast and his false prophet were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.  <br>  Rev 20:10 Then the Devil, who betrayed them, was thrown into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.  <br>  Rev 20:15 And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.|`|NZ0mRaG3aa	I'd certainly like it to be so. However, there is quite a lot about hell in the New Testament. So the source that poured out the most wonderful love into my life, and some freeing forgiveness, and has caused me to know God also teached about the reality of hell. Can one discard what one doesn't like about the message ? We know that it is God's salvation.<br>  <br>  Some people who have reported visions of the throne room of God (etc) have reported that they quaked like Isaiah in Isaiah 6 at the holiness of God, since even as christians the "flesh" pulls us down a lot, so we are not yet pure in the full sense. Some even reported that they felt so disgustingly dirty, that even though saved in the spirit, they were saying 'kill me' to God the Father as they found themselves so revolting morally in the presence of the Almighty; of course as christians they were under God's mercy and loving grace and that wasn't His will. But they became intensely aware of their sins, and the evil of it.

mo4MnsX7aa	You have to invite Jesus into your heart as Lord of your life.  If you do that, you will follow Him because of the love you have for Him, not because there are some rules for you to follow.|`|azD1REoEaa	I think that's a great start but this doesn't always necessarily guarantee that now we have become saved.   I'm going to emphasize here that there is no magic formula or words to say that will guarantee salvation.  Only God can grant us the gift of eternal life and it doesn't necessarily come that easily.   <br>  <br>  One example I'm reminded of is for instance the Billy Graham crusade.   When the call goes out for people to invite Christ hundreds of people come down the aisles to "accept Jesus" into their lives.  That's great but you'll also find that although many may have been "caught up in the moment" and "accepted Jesus" they eventually turn away from Christ.    Does that mean they lost their salvation?  No, it means that their repentance and belief was never real in the first place although they may have went through the motions of someone appearing to come to Christ.   <br>  <br>  True salvation is manifest in a demonstration of faith not a profession of faith.  If the word of God has taken root in our lives and we have been converted this results in a life changing experience where we become sanctified more and more as we live our life.  It results in a life that is deeply grieved and sorry for sin and it results in us repenting of our sins.  It means that the fruits of the spirit such as love, joy, peace, patience and kindness are manifest.    It means we trust the Bible and Christ 100% and it means our hope and treasure is heaven rather than the things of this life.  <br>  <br>  If faith and repentance of sins has not been manifest in our life we have to ask the question "am I really saved?"    The sad thing is many people decieve themselves into thinking they have become saved when they have not.  When Judgment Day does come it will be revealed that their conversion never took place and Christ will say "I never knew you".|`|O5KOwhovaa	I invited Jesus into my life.....but now he won't leave!!!<br>  <br>  Please help!!!!|`|3KD6RRhPaa	NO!!! If it was that simple then why is the church full of sinners all trying to get rid of their sins by their perpetual repentance prayers, making God so very angry?<br>  <br>  Jesus said this, "Many are on the broad way which leads to death, but narrow is the way which leads to life, but few find in."   It is therefore not so easy to just believe in Jesus, for the narrow way is hard to find. The Bible even tells us this: 'You do well by saying just believe in Jesus, but I tell you, even the devils believe and tremble."<br>  <br>  And looking at the church today it becomes clear that only few have found the narrow way, for you cannot find one single holy and sinless saint in just any church.<br>  <br>  The only way to this narrow way is for the seeker to cast his notions and thoughts he accumalated along the way away, and follow those saints who have gone before, and learn what this true faith is that God approves of, and then believe in it 100%.<br>  <br>  These saints can be found in those websites recorded in my Avatar.

One must also repent of sin first.<br>  <br>  Prayer for Salvation: Jesus Christ is the Son of God. If we have invited Jesus to come and live within us and be the Lord of our lives then our inheritance in the future kingdom is assured.<br>  <br>  God's word says in John 14:6, "Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me."<br>  In order to invite Jesus to be your Savior and Lord, you must believe in you heart that He is the Son of God, believe that He died upon the cross of Calvary as an atonement for your wrong doings, and believe that He arose from death and the grave. We must confess and repent of our sins and confess that Jesus Christ is Lord. If you have never done this then stop right now and pray this prayer.<br>  <br>  Heavenly Father, I come to You in the Name of Jesus repenting and asking forgiveness of all my sins. Your Word says, "whosoever shall call on the Name of the Lord shall be saved" (Acts 2:21). I am calling on You. I pray and ask Jesus to come into my heart and be Lord over my life according to Romans 10:9-10. "If thou shall confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thine heart that God has raised Him from the dead thou shalt be saved" I do that now. I confess that Jesus is Lord, and I believe in my heart that God raised Him from the dead. I am a Christian ..a child of Almighty God! I am saved!<br>  You are now an heir to the Kingdom of God!

Eternal Security|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	My own study of the Bible has convinced me that our souls or spirits go immediately into the presence of God when we die. The Apostle Paul wrote that those of us who are Christians "would prefer to be away from the body and at home with the Lord" (2 Corinthians 5:8).<br>  <br>  Although the Bible doesn't answer all our questions about life after death, it clearly tells us that we can look forward to heaven's joys when we die, if we know Christ. Shortly before His death and resurrection, Jesus told His disciples, "I am going there to prepare a place for you ... that you also may be where I am" (John 14:2-3). The Bible also says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23).<br>  <br>  The most important truth I can tell you about heaven, however, is that we will be with God, and nothing evil or harmful will ever touch us again. In heaven, God "will wipe every tear from their eyes. There will be no more death or mourning or crying or pain, for the old order of things has passed away" (Revelation 21:4). Why would anyone not want to go there?<br>  <br>  All this is possible because Jesus Christ took upon Himself the death and judgment we deserve when He died on the cross for us. And by rising from the dead, He showed that He has conquered death and Hell and Satan forever. Is your faith and trust in Him for your salvation? If not, commit your life to Him today. <br>  <br>  Let me assure you that the Bible teaches the life we live after we die will be real—just as real as this life, if not more so. We won't be in a state of dreamlike consciousness, but we will fully exist in body, mind and soul.<br>  <br>  The pattern for this is Jesus Himself. When Jesus died on the cross and was laid in a tomb, His physical body was completely and absolutely dead. But He came back to life by the power of God—and when He did, He had a different type of body, without the limitations it once had. His resurrected body wasn't an illusion; it was a glorious and immortal body that was just as real as His earthly body had been.<br>  <br>  And someday, if we know Christ, we too will be given new bodies—bodies like Christ's resurrected body. The Bible says, "So will it be with the resurrection of the dead. The body that is sown is perishable, it is raised imperishable" (1 Corinthians 15:42). Our bodies in heaven will be real, and so will our whole existence. Only in this way will we be able to serve God.<br>  <br>  But the real question is this: Are you ready for that day? Do you know—really know—that if you were to die tonight, you would go to be with Christ in heaven forever? You can know, by confessing your sins and your need of Christ, and trusting Him alone for your salvation. Salvation is real—and it can be yours by putting your faith and trust in Jesus Christ today.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	There are many prayers for the ones that have died. Me I'm not having hymns.

When YAHOSHUA returns the righteous will be brought back to life, and then they will live forever.  First in heaven (I believe) for 1000 years, then on the earth made new, after YAHOSHUA makes all things new and very good.  Those who reject life, and YAHOSHUA, will be brought back to life after the 1000 years, and then, after proving they are still evil by attacking the righteous, they will be destroyed in the lake of fire, and be no more.  YAHWEH has no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but the universe must be cleaned up, and He will do it.|`|gf3CCvuUaa	Catholics believe that the only sure way to salvation is through Jesus, and thus Christianity. However, there are other means of going to heaven, but they are not the sure way. So, if you are an atheists but you just live your good life and care and loving others, maybe, just maybe, you'll go to heaven.<br>  <br>  Hell is for those who deny, disrespect and thoroughly against God. Even sinners, murderers, rapists can go to heaven if in the final hour they truly repent. But those who simply denies God and His love, will go to hell.<br>  <br>  Additionally, Catholics believe in purgatory. It's a transition place before you can go to Heaven. Because we are all sinners, we are not worthy to face God in our worldly bodies and souls. Therefore, we 'cleanse' them so that we are free from sins and thus, worthy to face God.<br>  <br>  I don't know about other denominations though.|`|naI5hGjHaa	what???
1ec32bd76f3584208ce83bf42928a21faa	Those who do not know Jesus Christ as their Lord and Savior ie who are not saved will be judged and punished for their sins whatever their sins may be.  After the second coming of Jesus Christ and at the end of this age all sinners who are not saved will be judged at the white throne judgement at the appointed day and be found guilty and be cast into the lake of fire.  Christians will also be judged but only for reward for their services to the Lord and the good deeds they do in His name after they are saved.  You can read the Bible to learn of these things.  God bless you.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Galatians 5: 19-26<br>  "The acts of the sinful nature are obvious: sexual immorality, impurity and debauchery; idolatry and witchcraft; hatred, discord, jealousy, fits of rage, selfish ambition, dissensions, factions and envy; drunkenness, orgies, and the like. I warn you, as I did before, that those who live like this will not inherit the kingdom of God.<br>  <br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

It only takes one person and their sock puppet accounts to wreak havoc on your account. <br>  <br>  You're right in that we shouldn't have to deny access to our questions and answers.

I don't know what questions you asked or what response you got, but you are very, very confused about what it means to be Christian.<br>  <br>  All people are sinners, including you and me. I recognize that I'm a sinner and need saving. The only Saviour is Jesus Christ, who paid the penalty of your sins and mine, by suffering and dying on the cross. That knowledge creates in me a love for other people, a desire to serve God and do the right thing according to His laws.<br>  <br>  Know this, however. Not everyone who says they are a Christian really are. And even Christians who believe in Jesus as Son of God and Saviour may show sinful behaviour, because, GUESS WHAT, ALL PEOPLE ARE SINNERS, even and especially Christians! That's why we need Jesus! Not because we are "good" or "better" or "superior" but because we know we need Jesus.<br>  <br>  People sin, people fail, even Christians fall. But God does not change, and truth does not change, and God's Word is the truth.<br>  <br>  If Christians do something wrong and say it's God's will, yet it goes against God's true revealed word, that doesn't make it right. Yes, many have falsely taken that name and those claims, and have done it wrongly.<br>  <br>  God's Word does not change and truth remains truth.|`|GHdscZ2Haa	I think some have weak faith and some have strong faith.<br>  <br>  <br>  Just as some people very sincerely believe that they are Napoleon.

It is far more likely that some report monkey with a half dozen accounts decided that you were his target du jour.<br>  <br>  Hiding your Q&As will stop them retroactively digging though your questions to report you, but if they really want to zap you then they will.    Just part of the Y/A R&S game.<br>  <br>  It would be nice if Y/A would only allow one report per IP address, effectively limiting the damage one person can do with multiple accounts.

I mean here i am being very nice and not judging anyone and people are going to tell me that i am not going to go straight to hell but that i don't care enough about my spirit.

As a Christian you may enjoy a certain amount of political power, but only within the confines of the group (mob) mentality.  You want personal power, join the Army and ask for a gun.  The only "powers" you're going to end up with as a Christian is the ability to spread rumors and not feel guilty about it.

The substance of God is the substance of all things .God is in all things ,is all things, and beyond all things, therefore can be seen only indirectly as the physical universe,and its inhabitants. At the time of creation, there were only two raw materials to create with: God and nothing . All that is is some combination of 1's (God), and 0's (nothing), like a binary code.

Sometimes the Bible speaks about God's hands or eyes, but when it does, it is using symbolic language to convey some truth about His activity: "For the eyes of the Lord range throughout the earth to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him" (2 Chronicles 16:9).<br>  <br>  When the Bible says God created the human race in His image, it means that God put His character or imprint on our souls or spirits. We aren't God—but we are like Him (although limited). Because of this, we have the ability to love, and to know right from wrong. Because we bear God's image, we are different from the animals, and all human life is sacred.<br>  <br>  The tragedy is that God's image within us has been defaced and twisted by sin (although not destroyed). But Christ came to make us whole, and someday "we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is" (1 John 3:2).

AA11370093	Hi!<br>  <br>  The doctrine of the Trinity is not a biblical doctrine. It is a doctrine easy to scripturally refute, but the trinitarian models don't even get off the ground.<br>  <br>  There have been at least nine different doctrines of the Trinity throughout church history. The two most popular versions are the orthodox and social versions.<br>  <br>  Social trinitarianism (this forum is inadequate for a full theological discussion, so I'll hit the high points) asserts each Person of the Godhead is separate from the others. The term "God" is abstract like "corporation" and/or "family." Each Person is a full member of the one and only one divine family. Hence, you can have one "God" (family) but three Persons.<br>  <br>  The wheels come off of this version rather rapidly. Each Person is either finite or infinite. If finite, the aggregation of finite beings cannot make an infinite one. Three finite beings cannot compose omnipotence. If each Person is infinite, then you have three separate infinite beings. By definition, then, you have three Gods. There is also a host of logical problems associated with these sub-versions, but it is not necessary to highlight them now because this version was rejected long ago by orthodox adherents for the aforesaid reasons. However, many Christians espouse this version.<br>  <br>  The orthodox version asserts each Person "shares" the same divine essence. The essence of God, His being (so to speak), is shared equally by each Person. This "sharing" is not by division, for the divine essence cannot be divided. This "unity" is so complete that one cannot speak of *separate* Persons. The orthodox version insists each Person is *distinct* not separate. How the unity and distinction is maintained is a mystery that finite man cannot understand.<br>  <br>  Of course, the most obvious problem with this version is its intelligibility. Appealing to mystery will not do. If one is going to insist this doctrine best describes the biblical record of God, and an essential one at that, then it had better be coherent. Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox theologians have written extensively about the nature of God, His attributes and each Person of the Godhead. Although their works are admirable on effort alone, they fail to adequately describe what a Person is in relation to monotheism.<br>  <br>  Intelligibility aside, when compared to the biblical record, it fails miserably. Who was incarnate? God's nature cannot be divided, so it is *impossible* for God the Son to be incarnate without the Father and Spirit sharing *equally* in the incarnation. Hence, the Trinity was incarnate in Christ. Any divine act of Christ is *necessarily* the act of all three Persons. This makes the incarnation indistinct from Monarchianism.<br>  <br>  No appeal to person-person relationships in the Bible works for this model because the orthodox version (divine simplicity) denies the unity of the Godhead is a composite one. Against this, they argue that analogies are always inadequate for an immaterial being, but this will not do. Angels are immaterial beings, but we can understand their "personhood" regardless the inadequacy of material analogies.<br>  <br>  The prayers of Christ cannot work as orthodox proof-texts because *any* assistance from the Father *necessarily* entails assistance from the Son and Spirit. An indivisible Godhead precludes restricting the 2nd Person's presence to the incarnation, hence, any prayer for assistance by "the man" Christ Jesus necessitates an appeal to His own divine Spirit. Thus, their own arguments against modalism self-destruct.<br>  <br>  The glue that has held this doctrine together is the appeal to mystery. Coupled with this is an inadequate definition of faith which obligates the faithful to take a logical "leap" away from reason. The dominant position enjoyed by Catholicism and Protestantism in the West has kept this doctrine alive under a veil of mystery. But mystery cannot disentangle this doctrine from polytheism.<br>  <br>  At bottom, the doctrine of the Trinity, in all its forms, is tritheism masquerading as monotheism.<br>  <br>  Isaiah 43<br>  10. Ye are my witnesses, saith the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall there be after me.<br>  11. I, even I, am the Lord; and beside me there is no saviour.<br>  <br>  If you would like to discuss this further, feel free to email me.<br>  <br>  Kind regards,<br>  Scalia|`|dwPxU89Vaa	If I say a have a wife, it is an implication that I am married, even if I didnt say "I am married" it remains true that I am.<br>  <br>  Bible says clearly that there is only one God, and it says too that three persons has Gods attributes, the Father, The Son and the Holy Spirit.  These are three persons because they have personalities, and individuality, that makes them persons, and they are God who is still one, as there is only one True God. There are plenty of references of that in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Is 48:16 speaks cleary about the trinity as Jesus is speaking about the Father and the Holy Spirit|`|gC5eFMyTaa	The Trinity?

The only "verse" that ever calls Him three is 1 John 5:7 (as in the KJV, the NIV doesn't have it). This verse is a fraud, not found in any ancient Greek manuscript prior to eleventh century, where it was scrawled in the margin, rather than appearing in the text.<br>  <br>  The Bible also never uses the word "persons" in connection with God, but does, in Job, use the word "person."<br>  <br>  Both Isaiah and John found themselves standing before the throne of God. Both recorded the same thing: One throne, and one sitting on the throne. Where were the other two?<br>  <br>  Jesus is called the Father in Is. 9:6, and Col. 2:9 says that all the fullness of the Godhead resides bodily in Him.<br>  Father Son and Holy Ghost are not persons in the Godhead. They are positions held by the One God. This is why the apostles never repeated those titles in baptism, but always used the name of Jesus.
EJHhCDcaaa	It is true that many holidays have their origins in idolatry or pagan practices. It is also true that other things we utilize have their origin in paganism, such as our calendar (days of the week and months are named after pagan gods). The celebration of wedding anniversaries and the giving of rings in marriage also has pagan roots. Symbols used in the modern business world, and artwork on stationary, wallpaper, etc. are often borrowed from pagan sources. Are we to separate ourselves into some kind of monastery or private community where all vestiges of paganism have been carefully screened from our presence? <br>  <br>  Such an attitude calls to mind the Pharisees, who spent long hours discussing what was "clean" and "unclean," and making rules for the people to follow, as if such rules would make them clean. Anyone who takes the time to examine their traditions (such as later contained in their Talmud) will note how absurd it is to search out every little detail of what is "right" or "wrong." On the other hand, if we really believe that God intended us to scrupulously observe these matters (as if failure to do so would damn us), then like the Pharisees, we should engage in a continual screening of all traces of paganism from our lives. To stop short of eliminating any traces of it would be hypocritical, would it not? <br>  <br>  Not so, sayeth the Watchtower. They claim to have a balance in this matter of what is pagan and what isn't. Note these statements from a 1976 Awake! article regarding the use of pagan symbols, such as the heart, the swastika, and the cross: <br>  <br>  What should be a Christian's attitude toward shapes and designs that have at some time or place been connected with false religion? . . . <br>  <br>  . . . just because idol worshipers at some time or place might use a certain design, that does not automatically mean that true worshipers must always shun it. For instance, figures of palm trees, pomegranates and bulls were incorporated in the design of Jehovah's temple in Jerusalem. The fact that other religions might take these natural things that God created and use them as symbols in idol worship did not make it wrong for true worshipers to use them decoratively. Anyone visiting the temple could tell that God's people were not worshiping these decorations or venerating them as sacred symbols. <br>  <br>  So the Christian needs to be primarily concerned about what? Not what a certain symbol or design possibly meant thousands of years ago or how it might be thought of on the other side of the world, but what it means now to most people where he lives. <br>  <br>  With so many different designs having been used in false worship, if a person went to the trouble and took the time he might find an undesirable connection with almost every design he sees around him. But why do that? Would it not be needlessly upsetting? And is that the best use of one's time and attention? (Awake!, Dec. 22, 1976, pgs. 12-15)<br>  <br>  We concur with them that it certainly is a waste of time looking for pagan connections in every object. Note similar statements in the WT of May 15, 1972 (p. 295): <br>  <br>  Whether an object is an idol or not primarily depends on how it is viewed. . . . the fact that various creatures, plants and heavenly bodies - all parts of God's creative works have been and still are being given veneration would not in itself make them unacceptable for decorative or ornamental purposes. Many things that were at one time worshiped by the ancients have lost their idolatrous significance and are generally regarded as being merely ornamental.<br>  <br>  The Watchtower is emphasizing that (1) Designs or symbols in themselves are not necessarily wrong to use, even if once used by pagans in false worship. (2) It is a waste of time and needlessly upsetting to concern ourselves with what an object may have meant in times past, or even elsewhere on the earth in our day. <br>  <br>  The inconsistency of the WT now becomes manifest, for most all the holidays celebrated in the Western world have lost their original pagan significance. Take Christmas for example. Long before the time of Christ pagans worshiped the sun on December 25, the time of the winter solstice (where the sun is farthest from the earth). As with all pagan holidays, it was a time for generosity and licentiousness. When the Catholic Church instituted the celebration of the birth of Christ as December 25 around the year 336 A.D., it was to replace the Sol Invictus festival introduced by the emperor Aurelian in the 3rd century. It was considered the victory of Christianity over paganism. The later canonizing of St. Nicholas (Santa Claus) and the giving of gifts was tied in with church history. <br>  <br>  According to the Watchtower's reasoning, the question we should ask is: Does Christmas mean to us what it did to the pagans? Do people in our part of the world still worship the sun on December 25? The answer is NO. Though it is a time of year that is abused and exploited by many, that cannot be used as a case against.  the Christian concept of Christmas. Though the WT complaint that Christ was not born on December 25 is true, a celebration need not take place on the actual day of its memorial. Most of us get holidays off from work on different days than the historical date, and we don't consider such a practice wrong! <br>  <br>  Easter has a more church-related history. Originally, the early church celebrated the modern equivalent of Easter (the resurrection of Christ) on every Sunday, in expectation of the return of the Lord. Later, in linking the Passion and the Resurrection story, this memorial was scheduled on Passover, the Jewish feast celebrating the Exodus from Egypt. The date for the celebration was finally set by the Council of Nicaea in 325 A.D. as the first Sunday after the full moon that follows the spring equinox. As early as the eighth century the name "Easter" was transferred by the Anglo-Saxons to the Christian festival. The name itself was borrowed from a celebration to Astarte, goddess of fertility. Also borrowed from the celebration to Astarte was the use of rabbits and eggs, common symbols of fertility in the pagan culture. (For more information on Christmas and Easter, see Encyclopedia Britannica (1982 Ed.), Vol. 4, page 501.) <br>  <br>  While the trappings of both church history and the pagan holiday are still with us, their significance has changed. As with the original observance of the resurrection, today we do not connect rabbits and eggs with fertility rites, and neither do most people consider Easter as a time for greater licentiousness. Even the television programs during this time are geared to obviously Christian themes.<br>  <br>  By the way is not a rabbit a creature that was created by our creator.  I see no problem using this theme of the rabbit and the eggs to keep the interest of the little children in Jesus Christ.  This is a tool of learning, not a pagan practice.|`|AA10052130	I don't know, nor care, about what JW's commemorate, but the Bible, the Word of GOD, sets the commemoration of Christ's death and NOT his resurrection.

I know the jw's will say that there is no command from God or Christ to celebrate it but neither is there a command to not celebrate birthdays or the birth of Christ, and we all know they don't celebrate them.

Well if it were then I am sure that God would have mentioned it somewhere since it was started and spoken about in his word.But He does not.<br>  <br>  So if someone does they celebrate it unto God and who can condeme them?
Lt41tqwZaa	John 1:1 is a good example, but I’ve decided to list some of the lesser known examples, in the hopes that any JWs who read this will think about it rather than give the gut response that is no doubt stirred up by the very mention of John 1:1 and verses like it.<br>  <br>  John 4:17<br>  NASB: “that is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you.”<br>  NWT: “the spirit of the truth, which the world cannot receive, because it neither beholds it nor knows it. YOU know it, because it remains with YOU and is in YOU.”<br>  Agenda: The NWT refers to the Holy Spirit as an “it” because they believe it as a force, but in the context of this passage, the pronoun “it” does not make sense. The Holy Spirit is systematically changed to a less personal “spirit” and given the pronoun “it” throughout the NT.<br>  <br>  Romans 8:1<br>  NASB: “Therefore there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.”<br>  NWT: “Therefore those in union with Christ Jesus have no condemnation.”<br>  Agenda: The change is a little subtle, and there are many passages with only slight changes, but taken together it seems that all were made for a purpose. In this case, the word “now” is omitted, because the WTS teaches that one will never know for sure if they are free from condemnation until the resurrection. It must be nerve-wracking. (See also 1 Cor. 15:2)<br>  <br>  1 Corinthians 6:19<br>  NASB: “Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?”<br>  NWT: “What! Do YOU not know that the body of YOU people is [the] temple of the holy spirit within YOU, which YOU have from God? Also, YOU do not belong to yourselves,”<br>  Agenda: The WTS does not teach that the Holy Spirit dwells in individual members, so the verse is changed to imply that the Spirit merely dwells in the body of believers as a whole.<br>  <br>  Titus 2:13<br>  NASB: “looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus,”<br>  NWT: “while we wait for the happy hope and glorious manifestation of the great God and of [the] Savior of us, Christ Jesus,”<br>  Agenda: The agenda needs no explanation. This is one of my favorite verses because it indisputably calls Jesus God. The NWT seems to break every Greek grammar rule in the book, and the rule they’re breaking here is Granville Sharp’s rule, which essentially states that when you have two nouns, which are not proper nouns (proper nouns being names like Paul or John), and the two nouns are connected by the Greek word for “and,” and the first noun has the article “the,” while the second noun does not, then they are referring to the same person. The NASB translation (and most others) follows this rule perfectly. This is not a “sometimes” rule, as there are no passages in the entire body of existing Koine Greek literature (not just the Bible) that violate it. JWs are left with only two alternatives: either Jesus is the God, or a God-inspired writer fudged his grammar in a big way. (See also 2 Peter 1:1).|`|AA10554783	john 1; 1, really the whole book is riddled with em.|`|CmHLKKODaa	John 1 ..........<br>  <br>  A God ?????<br>  <br>  Insanity !<br>  <br>  He Is God .......<br>  <br>  It's not going to go well for some !|`|6Q4xh4F1aa	Colossians 1:15 – 17.

All [other] things have been created through him and for him. 17 Also, he is before all [other] things and by means of him all [other] things were made to exist...<br>  <br>  Adding the word [OTHER] is wrong because it is not in the original Greek texts.  They try to justify adding words to their translation in order to complete the "sense" in english.

"In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was *a* god.".  This is a profound mistranslation of the Greek.

All churches have bad.|`|AA11124121	there are none..|`|EJHhCDcaaa	Many are going to give some verses that are different, I am going to approach it from a different view.<br>  <br>    Consider these two important truths about the art of Bible translation: <br>  <br>  Accurately translating the entire Bible from the original ancient Greek, ancient Hebrew, and ancient Aramaic is a task requiring a considerable degree of technical expertise.  It is a job for bona fide Greek and Hebrew scholars.  It is not a job for amateurs or dilettantes armed with a lexicon and having little real understanding of the subtleties of Greek and Hebrew grammar. <br>  <br>  Having an accurate translation of the Bible is very important since the Bible is the only infallible means we have for obtaining detailed information about God and his will for our lives. Scripture defines our belief, our practice and therefore, how we will live. <br>  <br>  Four red flags of warning must be raised about the New World Translation: <br>  <br>  The New World Translation is entirely the product of one religious sect.  Translations produced by one individual or one sect should always be approached with caution.  Translations produced by teams of scholars representing a diversity of theological perspectives are safer.  The diverse theology of the translators in such cases forms a built-in safeguard against any one sect or individual smuggling (either deliberately or inadvertently) their own doctrinal bias into the translation.  The New International Version and the New American Standard Bible are good examples of “safe” translations (i.e. ones produced by theologically diverse teams of highly competent Greek and Hebrew scholars). <br>  <br>  The Watchtower leadership has repeatedly refused to divulge the names and/or academic qualifications of the people within their organization who produced the New World Translation . Common sense should tell anyone that it is not wise to trust a Bible translation produced by totally anonymous translators, whatever might be their stated reasons for wishing to remain anonymous.  How are we to know whether they have the necessary expertise to produce an accurate translation?  Let me illustrate.  Suppose your ten-year-old son needs a kidney transplant.  Suppose that a man you have never met before approaches you, claiming to be a surgeon, and offers to perform the operation free of charge.  Yet your repeated requests to know this man’s name, to find out whether or not he graduated from medical school, or to learn whether he is a member of the American Medical Association are politely rebuffed.  The “surgeon,” allegedly because he is extremely humble and wishes to receive no glory or credit for his good deeds, simply refuses reveal this information about himself.  Would you allow this man to operate on your son?  If you would not trust a loved ones mortal life to an anonymous (possibly unqualified) “surgeon”, why would you trust your eternal destiny to a committee of anonymous (possibly unqualified) Bible translators? <br>  <br>  Numerous qualified Greek scholars of international renown have voiced serious reservations about the New World Translation.  Dr. Bruce Metzger of Princeton University (arguably the world’s foremost living Greek scholar) calls many of the New World Translation’s renderings “erroneous".  Dr. Julius R. Mantey (co-author of A Manual Grammar of the Greek New Testament and A Hellenistic Greek Reader) called it “a shocking mistranslation”.  Dr Robert Countess concluded, in his PhD dissertation on the New World Translation,  “it [the New World Translation] must be viewed as a radically biased piece of work.  At some points it is actually dishonest". <br>  <br>  As far as we have been able to determine, no baptized Jehovah’s Witness has ever been awarded a post-graduate academic degree by an accredited institution in the field of Biblical Greek or Hebrew.  This is rather startling in a religious sect of approximately six million people who pride themselves on being zealous students of the Bible.  One would be hard pressed to find any Christian group of similar size that could not boast of at least a half-dozen or so persons with advanced academic degrees in fields relating to Biblical languages.  It is, of course, possible that there are Jehovah’s Witnesses with advanced degrees in Greek and Hebrew that we do not know about.
AA10083573	All you have to do is read some of the answers here, and you have your answer. Pride is the only reason to reject Jesus as the payment for all our sins. People don't like to be reminded that they're sinners. They don't like to be personally responsible for their sins. They get on their high horse (pride) and rise up in your face, asking you who you think you are telling them that they're a sinner. It's like telling a drunk he's an alcoholic. He can't see it, because alcohol has clouded his judgment of his condition. Sin does the same thing. It clouds our judgment to be able to see our deepest need. It's like this story I once heard...a warning goes out into a town that the dam is about to break, and everyone should get to high ground immediately. One fella looks out his window and sees that the skies are blue, so ignores the warning. The police drive through the streets, telling everyone to evacuate immediately to high ground. He still doesn't see the need to leave, so turns up his TV. All of a sudden, he hears a noise, and runs to his window to look out. He sees a wall of water coming down his street. Quickly, he runs up his stairs, thinking that he can wait it out on the top floor of his house. He looks out his window, seeing the water rush by. A police boat comes by, and seeing him in his window, call out for him to get in the boat. But the fella shakes his head and says that he doesn't think it's that bad. The boat leaves and the water rises more. Soon the fella has to sit on his roof, the water just a few inches from the eaves. A helicopter comes by and tells him to grab the ladder & get pulled up. The fella shakes his head and tells them that he thinks the water will start going down soon, as he knows the region and believes that the worst is almost over. The helicopter leaves. The water continues to rise, sweeping the fella from the roof, and he drowns. The fella finds himself in front of Jesus, and angrily asks Jesus why He didn't save Him. Jesus tells the fella, "Well, I warned you that the dam was going to break, but you trusted your own eyes that things looked too good to heed the warning. Then, I sent the police to go by and warn you again to get to high ground, but you still didn't see the need to leave, and chose to ignore the warning again. Next, I sent a boat to you to take you to safety, but you again didn't see that things were as bad as what everyone thought. And lastly, I sent you a helicopter, and you refused to grab the ladder and be rescued. Your decision to refuse help was based on what you thought you knew, but it was faulty knowledge. I came for you several times, but you refused My help. And now I can't help you." And that's the way it is in our lifetime. We receive many "invitations" to be rescued, but if we have faulty knowledge of our need of a Savior, we don't reach out for that Savior. Sadly, many really don't think they need a Savior, and will even say they don't want a Savior, since they haven't done anything to be saved from. Many will use worldy markers to judge whether or not they're "bad" people. They'll say stuff like, "I'm not a murderer, rapist, molester, or like some other nasty person they know, thinking that if they're not "that bad", that they're just fine the way they are. And nothing you or I can say will change their minds. The only thing that can change their mind (and actually their heart) is the Holy Spirit, who draws people close to God. He does the urging, putting an emptiness inside that only God can fill. And until the person realizes that this emptiness is something only God can fill, then they really don't see their need of any kind of salvation. And there are a few who have been so damaged by religion, that they don't want to hear about it at all. The only thing we can do about it is to just continue living the life that Jesus has given us, and by living that life in a way that brings honor & glory to Him. And that this kind of life will show those who are searching that there is a difference between religion, and a live lived in Christ. Sad to say, many Christians don't show this, so that's why many don't see it as something they need. And that's the bottom line...having your deepest need fulfilled. We all have a God-shaped hole in us, that only God can fill. Everyone stuffs all kinds of things into that hole, but nothing fits like God. <*)))><|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	No, I think all people who fail to "accept Christ" do so because they simply do not believe that any Christ exists.

yN3fWUCuaa	I would imagine most non-Catholic Christians, while viewing suicide as a sin, would still consider the person to be under the grace of God.<br>  <br>  Especially for those of the "security in salvation" mindset, this would not be an unforgivable sin.<br>  <br>  I cannot imagine anyone in their "right mind" commits suicide.|`|WwCBomTMaa	There is always hope. No matter your situation. It is also a sign that you lack in faith. If you commit suicide what you are silently saying to God is "I don't believe you can make things better".<br>  <br>  Also, you can pray for whatever you like. And God will always answer. Sometimes his answer will be "no" though. I highly doubt if God would grant a prayer of suicide. For why would he grant a prayer for someone who has no faith? And that is what you will be if you pray for such a thing.<br>  <br>  Have a great day!! :)|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	Please give scriptural citation for the assertion that Christians are not allowed to commit suicide. I know a lot of Christians will disagree with me on this one, but that is just fine. Either you believe the Bible or you don't, and it says that God is the giver and taker of life. It is not really possible to commit suicide without it being God's will for you to expire. Jesus said, 'Blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.'  If you think you can name me one person more poor in spirit than one contemplating suicide, I would be very interested to know who that is.<br>  That being said, if you are contemplating suicide and feel that you cannot carry on, let me assure you that nothing in this life is impossible to deal with when you let God lead you and that when God is ready for you, He will take you as He sees fit. Until then, confess and repent all sin that is keeping you from experiencing the joy of the Lord. Seek Him in earnest and humbly accept His will for your life. You will be glad that you did. He loves you and has good things in store for you. God bless.|`|jpgP5simaa	It is much better to pray and ask God to try to make things better for you or to give you more strength in front of adversity. <br>  <br>  In times of trouble let's not forget to confine in Jesus. There is a passage that I quite like when he says:<br>  <br>  "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. <br>  <br>  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. <br>  <br>  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light." (Matthew 11:28-30)|`|C33dNHSDaa	Not an easy question to answer. All I can say is Seek God for all understanding .He's is the only one that can help, You can always ask God to take you.But I feel he wouldn't until he was ready for you.God has a job for all of us and we ain't going until it's done!|`|g4AAZRuxaa	No.|`|K6UbI5Ooaa	You can pray for it but I wouldn't expect it to be answered. There is no reason for suicide nothing in life is permanent not even life. Any problem you are experiencing is temporary and will pass. If you are seriously depressed you need to see a doctor and find out if you have a chemical imbalance causing it, so you can be treated, otherwise volunteer at a nursing home or hospital helping others helps you. When we are thinking about others it takes the focus off of our problems and sometimes helps us realize that our problem is not as bad as we thought it was when we were only thinking about our self. No suicide is not allowed because it is murder, it is also against the law in all 50 states. So get help seek counseling or medical help. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary situation, and causes severe pain for your family and loved ones. And is the most selfish act anyone can do, it gets you out of the problem but leaves your family to pick up and clean up your mess.

And even a Jackass? But very few if any could have cared less.<br>  <br>  These were people who saw HIS work and Miracles first hand? And forgot about them second hand. They were rescued from the Mightiest  Army and Ruler of their time. BY?  Only one person, GOD. GOD sent Moses as HIS messenger, and after Moses was done following GODS plan? The Egyptians gave up and begged Moses to take these people and go. And then a Day latter, Pharaoh decided to take his army and kill all of the Jews. The death and destruction of the mighty army was witnessed by JEWS, as the RED sea swallowed them up.<br>   GOD went before them by a Pillar of Smoke during the Day, And a Pillar of Fire by Night. They saw HIS mighty wonders and powers first hand. And all they did was to grumble. They wanted Wine, HE gave them Water from a rock. They wanted Steak, HE gave them Bread. <br>  <br>  He was their GOD, their Creator, They worshiped and made Dead false Gods to worship. Things like this went on for Generations. One Generation would tell of GODS good deeds and works. And everyone was just peachy. Until the stories of GODS greatness disappeared from ear shot. <br>  <br>  And for sin atonement. There had to be animal sacrifices for their sins.<br>  They almost ran out of animals. But then GOD told HIS only SON JESUS CHRIST, that HE was going to have to go to Earth in Fleshy form, And die for all sins of man kind. HE would be the last sacrifice made for our sins.<br>  <br>  Now, It's all about JESUS CHRIST. HIS Church, HIS people (Every soul on Earth) He died a most horrible lonely death, Separated from GOD the FATHER, when HE bore the sins of the entire World in his body just before death.  HE did this? Out of Pure love for HIS creation.  <br>  <br>  After JESUS rose from the Dead, Many saw HIM for a Month or so. NOW no one see's HIM or THE FATHER. Wouldn't do any good if we did, someone would try to kill them. <br>  <br>  So now we Christians walk in The faith, Knowing that JESUS died for our Sins. And that we will live with HIM for all of eternity. We also know, HE pays our bills, Heals us when were sick. Gives us fresh air to breathe and fresh water to drink.HE puts the Grub on the table. And HES with us 24/7.<br>  <br>  This is why we know HE LIVES!<br>  <br>  GOD Bless YA,<br>  <br>  Chicago Bob.

The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic (self-evident). That’s why the Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’" (Psalm 14:1). The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God, and defends his belief by thinking that the question "Who made God?" can’t be answered. This, he thinks, gives him license to deny the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn’t. If there is a brick wall with "The End" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind the brick wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe (have faith) that space has no beginning and no end. The same applies with God. He has no beginning and no end. He is eternal.<br>  <br>  The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist. That will be called "eternity." God Himself dwells outside of the dimension He created (2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 1:2). He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came into being. He can move through time as a man flips through a history book.<br>  <br>  Because we live in the dimension of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end—by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrums.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Special pleading - Somehow, faith = gnostic knowledge.|`|sA7DuUUBaa	the reason my friend the Christan's do this is because its essayer for them to use religion as a refuge for there Small minds. air jesus sky daddy. faith.. give me a break.. it was just the other day I cough them in a lie they all claim from time to time god made us from clay and jesus is the son of god then at other times they say jesus is god and at another time they say we got here because god thought us into existence and it became true. now which is it did he run out of glay or something. they want to lie about the truth and don't want to face the facts that there is no god and we are more alone than they know. the world is black and white more than know and less gray. its time to make a stand and stop denieing existence Christan's and start by being a friend to logic instead of pushing it away and worshiping artifacts and air.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I know He exists, and you know he doesn't.<br>  <br>  Now how is that automatically better than <br>  <br>  I know He doesn't exist and you know he does !!<br>  <br>  Wait, wait, I know : What you think is true, and what other people think isn't.

JESUS SAID THAT YOU MUST HATE YOUR FAMILY TO GO TO HEAVEN WHEN YOU DIE!<br>  <br>  By believing in Jesus and being “saved” the Bible writers tell you that you will get one of the first seats in Heaven to watch how the vast majority of all the human beings perhaps into the TRILLIONS including your “unsaved” family members and old acquaintances will be especially tormented one by one in a sulfuric lake of fire or what have you for ever and ever. You will be encouraged to poke fun at them showing a wet big finger for them to lick to quench their thirst because in Hell there is no fresh water and you can tease them all you want for ever and ever! That’s HEAVEN! No wonder Jesus said that you must hate your father and your mother and everybody else to follow him, especially if they are "unsaved" and go to HELL! You will hear a lot of “I told you so…” from Sweet Jesus! He thought of everything even some low IQ teasing games that WE CAN ALL PLAY with the damned in Hell! Heaven is for the childlike poor and uneducated so please bear with me in this story written by the authors of God’s Holy Word, the Bible!<br>  <br>  Luke 16:23-25-NIV (Jesus is telling us…) AND BEING IN TORMENTS IN HELL, he* (*Not a gay person, or a Godless Atheist, or and abortionist, but a rich Jewish person whom Jesus knew personally! In those days to be rich was the fad sin of the day.) lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham afar off, and Lazarus in his bosom* (*If you go to Hell you will recognize EVERYBODY in Heaven especially your family members, and vise versa!). “Then he cried and said, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue; FOR I AM TORMENTED IN THIS FLAME.’ (and Jesus all excited and turned on like mad continues the story telling… BTW, at this point you can tell the necessary IQ level to believe all this crap “in your heart!”) But Abraham said, ‘Son* (*Abraham was an ancestor of this rich man! Notice how little compassion any member of your own family will have on you when you end up in Hell!), remember that in your lifetime you received your good things* (*again. in this story to be rich is a sin! Christian preachers now use it to make it applicable to ANY SIN!), and likewise Lazarus evil things; but now he is comforted* (* for all eternity, for ever and ever, and ever! billions and trillions of years…!!!) and YOU ARE TORMENTED!<br>  <br>  Believe it or not, there is hardly any other specific description in the Bible of what else any Christian will be doing in Heaven except for “worshiping” this narcissist Bible God for ever and ever while poking fun at the damned in Hell…!!! Christians need to forget that the Bible writers are telling us that during the “Creation Week” as soon as God created Heaven and the angels 1/3 of them were not one bit impressed with God’s “beauty and Holiness” and rebelled against him on the spot under the leadership of Lucifer* (*Light Bearer – The most beautiful Angel ever created!) and they became Demons and Satan, and so on.<br>  <br>  The Bible God promised the Jews to be “rich lenders and not borrowers” like this rich man in Hell, otherwise IF THEY DON’T OBEY they will be poor “slaves and borrowers” like Lazarus in Heaven! I know it sounds screwy, but what the heck that’s the story that the Bible writers managed to say! That’s why I get a lot of email telling me that not everything in the Bible should be taken literally… short of seriously! Especially the silly teasing words that Sweet Jesus aka “Creator of the Universe” will personally enjoy hearing and watching the Christians POKE AT ALL THOSE IN HELL FOR EVER AND EVER for not believing in Jesus, or for never hearing about him, or not having the mental faculties in order to accept Jesus, or not being obedient to the clergy, or not being respectful at all the Christian religious displays in public places, or not paying the tithes and offerings ON TIME! It will be a long time before anybody in Heaven can possibly get bored! Only Jesus knows what other torments await for those in HELL…!!! Low IQ people will love to be entertained for ever and ever like that… or wouldn’t they? That’s about the only hope that they have on being right on anything! What the heck! It is all in the Bible that Christians hardly read!<br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Sweet Jesus is very excited telling this other story, too!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here AND KILL THEM IN FRONT OF ME!* (*Not even the Mafia measures up to Jesus! Christianity surely is a “slaughter house” religion and the preachers know how to profit out of it!)<br>  <br>  Revelation 14:10-11 (NIV) [Jesus says] "he, too, will drink of the wine of God's fury, which has been poured full strength into the cup of his wrath. HE WILL BE TORMENTED WITH BURNING SULFUR IN THE PRESENCE OF THE HOLY ANGELS AND OF THE LAMB* (*i.e. Sweet Jesus Christ, and the Christians who managed to be saved in spite of all the hurdles that Jesus set up -John 17:24 will enjoy watching!) And THE SMOKE OF THEIR TORMENT RISES FOR EVER AND EVER. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and his image, or for anyone who receives the mark of his name." <br>  <br>  At the same time The Christians will be worshipping God day and Night WITHOUT REST FOR EVER AND EVER AND EVER… Just how narcissist can the Bible God possibly get?  <br>  <br>  Revelation 4:8-9 (KJV) …and they REST NOT DAY AND NIGHT, saying, Holy, holy, holy, Lord God Almighty, which was, and is, and is to come* (*that’s also some stuff that the Christians will be doing for ever and ever and ever when they get to Heaven).  And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever, The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne…<br>  <br>  In reality there is no Heaven or Hell outside of the Bible. Even so some the most honest Bible writers say so, too. The whole idea is a very primitive religious people control device and a money making scheme banking on human gullibility! The Bible writers had God certify King Solomon to be the WISEST MAN ever to set foot on this Earth, and he has this to say... <br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 9:5,10 (NIV) For the living know that they will die, but the dead know nothing; they have no further reward* (*The grave is the final reward!), and even the memory of them is forgotten* (*Not true in all cases, but what the heck this is God’s word!). [10]   WHATEVER your hand finds to do, DO IT WITH ALL YOUR MIGHT* (*without any restriction just be wise!), for in the grave, where you are going, there is neither working nor planning nor knowledge nor wisdom.<br>  <br>  Ecclesiastes 3:19 (NIV) Man's fate is like that of the animals; the same fate awaits them both: As one dies, so dies the other. All have the same breath; man has no advantage over the animal. Everything is vanity.<br>  <br>  The writers of the Book of Job admitted the same destiny for humankind… <br>  <br>  Job 7:9 (NIV) As a cloud vanishes and is gone, so he who goes down to the grave does not return.|`|WpA7n8Iwaa	Do you see no contradiction in accusing Christians of being hateful, when that is exactly what you are doing yourself?  How can you have so little self-awareness not to see what you are saying?  <br>  <br>  The next fallacy is that disagreeing with somebody is a "stream of spite".  Untrue.  Just because a person doesn't believe that same sex marriages should be allowed doesn't mean they hate gay people.  There could be something else involved that you're not seeing - like people who are trying to preserve the fabric of society and not watch what they perceive to be God-given roles eroded.  My sister is gay and I love her, but that does not mean that I will violate what I know the Bible teaches.<br>  <br>  Next, I will agree that threatening eternal damnation is wrong when a Christian seems to enjoy it ( and I agree some do), but if you will read Ezekiel 33 and Jude 1:23, you will see that God has given us a duty to warn people about hell and frankly I don't follow that enough.  But my desire to be a "watchman" and obey God is much stronger than my fear of offending people who don't like to hear what they deep down already know.  If you thought it through, you would see that if hell is true, and there's no way that you can prove it does not exist, then warning people about it is actually an act of love.|`|HdmlZdyHaa	I think you should read the Bible again.

Some seem to be suggesting that if it had not been for syncretism between pagan religions and Catholicism that all Christians would be Arians based on the information that some pagan religions had beliefs similar to Christian Trinitarian beliefs therefore the Trinity is wrong and Arius was right. If I was to list all of the pagan religions that believed in oneness as did Arius and his modern day heretical followers, would that prove that Arius was influenced by Pagans and thus heretical for his beliefs and practices? I pray all can see the folly of such arguments. Are we to accept such comparisons which persuade only by their volume those that are ignorant and not on the truthfulness and application of the comparisons but on the gullibility and prejudice of the hearer?<br>  <br>  Other claims are not based on pagan religious practices but on Platonic philosophy. Certainly there was an influence of Greek philosophical thought in the early Church as the early Christians even in Jerusalem had contact with the diaspora Jews who were the early converts to Christianity. St. Paul was one of them. However, the argument for Hellenistic influence falls apart when one realizes that Jesus taught what would be understood to be Hellenistic influence if it was not for the realization that it was not only the Greek’s who taught similarly but also certain Jewish sects, particularly the Essenes. This is most prominent in the soteriological teaching of Jesus. In other words similarity does not necessarily mean “descended from”. One should pay particular attention to the fact that those who suppose the similarities to the mystery religions that invaded the Roman Empire three centuries before Christ from the East point out marked but superficial resemblances to Catholicism and many of those resemblances are shared by all Christians including the accusers. Reason would say that if Catholicism has more resemblances it is because Catholicism is a broader fullness of Christianity because of Catholicism’s direct origin from Christ and the apostles and long history of scholarship. In other words because of the broadness of the faith it is a bigger target for the Church’s detractors than would the truncated Christianity of the critics. So it would seem reasonable to say that if the Catholic Church has similarities to these mystery cults and that means that Catholicism is false the same standard should be used against Catholic critics and their truncated Christian sects who also share similarities.<br>  <br>  The origin of most of this anti-Catholic propaganda comes from the book written by Alexander Hislop, called “Two Babylons” published in the mid nineteenth century. Another book written by Ralph Woodrow called ”Babylon Mystery Religion” is a revised and modernized version of Hislop’s book. Both of these books are simply lists of similarities of Roman, Babylonian and Egyptian religions to Christianity that these similarities imply descent. Church history makes such comparisons ridiculous but to the uninformed and uneducated in Church history with a predilection to be suspicious of Catholicism these accusations are believed by some. To the knowledgeable the similarities supposed are laughable but even though they are laughable and weak, people are still influenced.<br>  <br>  Religious similarities are inevitable because God relates to all people regardless of their exposure to Christianity. The Scriptures tell us that the law is written on the hearts of all men, not just Christians or Jews. Men may respond to that law within their own cultures and try to make sense of the innate knowledge they possess creating their own religions. Mankind share similar desires and it should not seem unusual when they come to similar conclusions, not necessarily because of the influence of one on another but because of the influence of God. Could this not be why the Gospel when shared with others speaks to their spirit whether they are pagan or Jew and brings people to faith in Christ? Christianity is the culmination of religion and philosophy in the hearts and intellects of men taken as far as man is capable on his own and beyond. Christ brought all intellectual and philosophical concepts of God and His plan for mankind to a conclusion that rests in Him and His redemption on the Cross culminated by the fact that “He is risen” and that through Him death and sin no longer has a hold on us.<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr.

In early life, he was a major figure in the Oxford Movement to bring the Church of England back to its Catholic roots. Eventually his studies in history persuaded him to become a Roman Catholic. Both before and after becoming a Roman Catholic, he wrote a number of influential books, including Via Media, Essay on the Development of Christian Doctrine (1845), Apologia Pro Vita Sua (1865-66) and the Grammar of Assent (1870).<br>  <br>  His body was buried in the small cemetery at Rednal near Birmingham, next to the Oratory country house. The grave was opened on 2 October 2008 with the intention of moving any remains to a tomb inside Birmingham Oratory, during Newman's consideration for sainthood; however, no remains were found due to the coffin having been wooden and the burial having taken place in a damp site. Canonization would make Cardinal Newman the first English person who has lived since the 17th century to become a saint. In 1991 Cardinal Newman was proclaimed "Venerable" by the Roman Catholic Church.|`|pfNnuD5saa	I am not Catholic. I don't see any reason to strip out heritage and culture from any group of people.

I am of the Anglican Tradition (who are experts on protestantism... considering we were one of the first).<br>  <br>  However, this is what the Church has always done.

It is a universal belief amongst both Protestants and Catholics that God takes a broken, sinful, degraded man and makes him whole and new. <br>  <br>  That is what the Church has done with pagan tradition. We have taken for example, the pagan festival of the Spring Solstice, a festival of new life, and focused it on the Resurrection of Christ, who Brings True New Life. <br>  <br>  Also you claim to follow the Traditions of the First church, which i assume you base upon the Book of Acts. <br>  <br>  If so, do celebrate Communion on a weekly basis?

Its a few cultural traditions that really don't hinder the peoples communication with God, as they see Him. <br>  All churchs have good and bad aspects.  Does the manor of prayer make that much difference to the supreme being? Is he going to get all twisted, if you are sitting ,kneeling ,or standing when you pray.  Are you  loving each other ,are you, loving God ,then so what if you have a tree in your house at Christmas. So what if your children dress in costumes and get candy on Halloween these are traditions not forms of worship. The Church in the distant past took a gentle path in its missionary work they were able to allow people their traditions which evolved into their present day , practices. Would you prefer that they disallow anything from the past...many of the cultural and religious practices overlapped as they do today. It was probably the only way to instill a new religion.<br>    The word Christian is the name of a follower of Jesus teachings...Catholic ,is the name of the Church,it means universal.<br>  Why are you and others attacking a church that was the only Christian church for 1500 years or so.  Your Church is a baby of the Catholic Church. Do some research ,and you will find this to be true.

mOaG5ueZaa	I believe it comes from a false understanding of the nature of sin and our need to be forgiven. Many people (atheists and some Christians alike) believe that failure to accept Jesus as your personal Lord and Savior will keep you out of Heaven. In a very relaxed sense this is true, but what really keeps people out of Heaven is their sin. The reason we need to accept Christ in the first place is because of our sin, which separates us from God. When Adam and Eve lived in the Garden of Eden, they enjoyed close fellowship with God before they sinned, and when they did their fellowship with God was broken and mankind entered a sinful state where sacrifices were needed to atone for our sins. We must accept Jesus to forgive us of our sins and to cleanse us, to make us good enough to enter such a holy place as Heaven where even one sin can keep us out.<br>  <br>  As a result, I believe many people started interpreting the unpardonable sin as rejecting Christ, but what rejecting Christ does is ensure that we won't be able to get into Heaven because of our sin. However, Christ is so holy that He detests sin, and to blaspheme the Holy Spirit, or to slander His name, making it on par with the works of evil, Satan, is so heinous that God will not forgive such an egregious error.|`|QqxZzvbAaa	when the Pharisees accused Jesus of using the power of satan instead of the Holy Spirit,that was blasphemy against the Holy Spirit,<br>  you're right.<br>  but if you deny Christ here then He will deny you to the Father.<br>  <br>  <br>  (IFB)|`|4sUek7ugaa	Who knows?

They lasted for about 20 years.<br>  <br>  So here I am going to try to explain about bliss, true healing experience and emotions.<br>  <br>  Strange enough I truly remember vividly that Spiritual bliss, Felicity, as I used to call it, has very little to do with emotions.<br>  It is not an emotion, it is not even Joy. Not even Love. <br>  It has something to with a total unification yes, a total relaxation, when duality is no more, yes.<br>  It is like a very clear single pure spot, where there is no heaviness, no gravitational pull, it is very light.<br>  My brain stops, if you can believe this. I don't think.<br>  Things happen, ordinary things happen, but I am seized, and captured, and I cannot move.<br>  It is like a cessation.<br>  And if I move, then the movement does not come from me.<br>  Things happen through me next. Healing, yes. For me and others. The Healing for me, I used to call it regeneration. Because after the Ecstasy, I felt Physically absolutely wonderful and regenerated, and this for a while.<br>  Again, there is no emotion, so no fear.<br>  Actually the Ecstasy often starts with a fall, from which I am never hurt.<br>  The fall is there because of my inner state of total self abandon.<br>  The Source is at the same time very gentle and very powerful.<br>  And absolutely non judgmental.<br>  I remember laughing !

HH90Eghaaa	Yes, sadly the No on 8 campaign failed! We underestimated the Yes on 8 campaign and instead took a defensive role when we should have took a proactive stance long before the Yes on 8 campaign even started their disgusting commercials! Partly this is because everyone thought it just couldn't happen in California! Time and time again the new reports on the ballot measure said it would fail by an overwhelming majority! <br>  <br>  Unfortunately that was not the case because money started pouring into the Yes campaign well before it did to the No campaign! After all why pour out money when it was set up to fail by the projective, we are in a recession after all! It was only later did we realize that it was going to be a fight to the bitter bloodily end that the No on 8 campaign started on the defense and not the offense which it should have took! Once again we had the California Constitution on our side! Truly it was sad!<br>  <br>  Now all we can do is look ahead!

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8. Jesus knew all men (John 16:30)<br>  9. Jesus is everywhere (Matt. 28:20)<br>  10. Jesus Christ, dwells in you (Col. 1:27)<br>  11. Jesus is the exact representation of the Nature of God (Heb. 1:3)<br>  12. Jesus is eternal (Micah 5:1-2)<br>  13. Jesus gives eternal life (John 10:27-28)<br>  14. Jesus is our only Lord and Master (Jude 4)<br>  15. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6)<br>  16. Jesus is called the Mighty God (Isaiah 9:6) and "God" also be called the Mighty God in Isaiah 10:21<br>  17. Jesus is able to raise Himself from the dead (John 2:19-21)<br>  18. Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26. Jesus is the One who will judge you on judgement day (John 5:22-23). Only God can be the judge.<br>  27. Jesus forgives sins (Luke 5:20) (Luke 24:47,Acts 10:43) .Only God can forgive sins.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a>|`|CmHLKKODaa	Thankfully yes !<br>  <br>  Three days and who raised Jesus from the Dead ?<br>  What did Jesus say ?|`|wuPTBIIuaa	this is a very debateable question<br>  <br>  jesus pre-existed, before the earth was formed<br>  <br>  he was part of the creation process. <br>  but i dont believe the fulness of the godhead was his until after he put the last enemy under his feet. that enemy is death. so the resurrection was the turning point in my understanding of when Jesus received all authority in heaven and in earth.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	Jesus was at one point the voice of God. As John said, He was the word. But as far as being here on earth. God took a piece of himself and gave it life. This is why God no longer spoke to the people after telling everyone that, this is my beloved son. All God did was take his voice and give it life. Jesus is the son and will continue to be the son.|`|7oCpSkmxaa	Jehovah God is the father, Jesus Christ is the son.  Jesus prayed to him father, he told people that the father was greater than him, and he said his father sent him.  When Jesus was baptized, Jehovah spoke from heaven and said "This is my son."  Jesus himself never claimed to be his father, and he directed all people to worship his father.<br>  <br>  Nowadays, some people worship Jesus as God.  Many people today mistakenly believe that they are the same person, but they are not, and never were.  Jesus is a very important figure, as he set for all of us a model to follow.  He also set the example for how we should pray.  Many people are familiar with the Lord's Prayer, or Our Father.  Who was he directing it to?  His, and our, heavenly father...... not himself.|`|k7FD3rt5aa	Yes.<br>  Compare Exodus 3:14 w/John 8:58.|`|RCqG4z5Oaa	The Holy Spirit before birth, the Holy Spirit at time of Spiritual conception, the Holy Spirit at birth, the Holy Spirit during His physical life on earth, the Holy Spirit on the cross, the Holy Spirit in the tomb, the Holy Spirit on His resurrection and the Holy Spirit upon His Ascension.|`|uD8d5V9Saa	They are one and the same.|`|zS29xWejaa	Yes, jesus was God. remember he was not given birth by man and woman.|`|niq3ETl0aa	Was and always is.|`|3aVxJYf6aa	No...if so..... why he could  died??<br>  <br>  They are one and the same???<br>  <br>  is Jesus his own father???

The act of Jesus dying and spilling His blood on our behalf is without question how we get salvation.  However, His resurrection is as vital in pinning our faith onto the hope of the reward for placing faith in Him and His death.
0aN1xIxfaa	Today people are being controlled by a philosophy that says that reality is a subjective experience - if it's real for you, it's real. It says God is not real. The philosophy says that if something is true for you, it's true. It says that God is not true. You believe that. Why? Because someone told you. So much for your imagined free will.|`|pGf4mIw9aa	I learned about God through God. Not through people but through God himself. Secondly, you are asking a lot of questions that only God can answer, so why don't you try talking to him and waiting for the answer. He does answer and he has time for all the questions in the world. <br>  How old are you twelve. Your asking why doesn't God do this and why doesn't God do that. Since you don't believe in God. Why don't you take yourself and do the very thing you are crying about doing?|`|e8a42257dd2b34817d2020222ee63839aa	1) "only way to know about god is through someone else":  Other people, the Bible, nature, other writings like novels, history:  all these things can tell you something about God and His will.  That's all right, but eventually we're supposed to start listening to what God says in our hearts.  How that happens for me is through silent prayer.<br>  <br>  2)  "Some people feel it in their heart":  God is a lot more than a feeling in a heart.  It's knowing in your heart.<br>  <br>  2a)  "would they feel in their hearts about God if no one even told them about God":  Yes.  They might not call Him "God", but what they would know in their hearts about loving other people -- that is God.<br>  <br>  3) why did God create stars and planets so far away from earth that it makes no difference?":  How do you know it makes no difference?  Astronomers find them, feel amazed and excited, and use their brains to find out about them.  Then they share the beauty of these far off objects with us.  That's pretty important to me.  And who knows what we might find when we visit those stars/planets in the future?  Besides, God is about extravagance and excess:  His creative love overflows and makes more beautiful things than we can ever imagine.  God is never limited by what is immediately useful and practical.<br>  <br>  4)  "why did God create earth?":  Earth is a gift for us to use and a responsibility for us to maintain.<br>  <br>  5)  "was he bored from existing forever:"  God doesn't experience boredom.  That's a human emotion that is caused by something being wrong.  God wanted something:; children to be the recipients of His love.  But that doesn't imply boredom.<br>  <br>  6)  "if God existed forever, why couldnt earth have existed forever?":  Again, you're looking at it from a human perspective, and it doesn't apply to God.  God exists outside of time.  There is no "now" or "then" or "later" or "forever" for God.  There is just one giant NOW.  So to say He was sitting in heaven forever getting bored, doesn't apply to God.<br>  <br>  7)   "why is there So much Death And Poverty in places in the world":  Free will.<br>  <br>  7a)  "the children born there are born into it, its not their fault":  Right.  It isn't the starving children's fault that they're starving.  It isn't their  misuse of free will that caused them to starve.  It is our fault, because we have more than enough food to eat and we don't make sure that they get some too.  It's our fault for misusing our free will, saying "Oh well.  They're starving in Africa.  Too bad.  I want McDonald's for supper."<br>  <br>  8)  "if god is all good, why doesnt he help them out":  God is all good.  He created us, you and me, with brains and abilities that He expects us to use to help them.  That's our job, not God's.<br>  <br>  9) "why cant god come out from hiding" and "I can live my life through without god":  God isn't hiding.  The problem might be that you don't know what to look for.  You could live your life through without air quicker than you could live your life without God.  You just don't know it.<br>  <br>  When people say that I think of a fish in a fishbowl saying "why can't I see water, if water exists," and "I can live my life through without water.  It's just a myth created by my parents."<br>  <br>  Question all you want.  It's good to question.  Just be open to answers that will challenge your current beliefs and cause you to rethink them sometimes.<br>  <br>  10)  God is as much a "He" as a "She," so no tears from me about that.<br>  <br>  11)  "Who created the Bible?":  many many people over many centuries.  Most of them were wise and inspired by God, but again, they had free will.  The inspiration they got from God didn't take over their will to make them write inerrent things.  They wrote through the filters of their own cultures and their own assumptions and prejudices.<br>  <br>  God gave us brains, and expects us to use them when we read the Bible too.  Just because it says that eating bacon is a sin, or that women shouldn't speak in church, doesn't mean those things are applicable for us today.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	no<br>  there are two ways, that NOONE can escape or bypass<br>  <br>  a person must receive personal knowledge <br>  or they must receive the testimony of others by faith. <br>  <br>  there is no other way to receive Christ and God. <br>  and no one comes unto God except through Jesus.|`|8OpFYoO4aa	Like the animals, ignorance is bliss.<br>  Easy come, easy go.|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Well said.|`|IAmYNgNaaa	this website might answer your questions: <a href="http://www.everystudent.com/features/isthere.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.everystudent.com/features/ist...</a>|`|qRue8Xdraa	:] Imagine, the missionaries who are doing this...<br>  <br>  Seriously to those who are deluded, message me and we'll have a debate. ;)|`|yN3fWUCuaa	God may not exist, put paragraphs most certainly exist.

[fn]  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 1:19 For the truth about God is known to them instinctively. [fn] God has put this knowledge in their hearts.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 1:20 From the time the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky and all that God made. They can clearly see his invisible qualities--his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse whatsoever for not knowing God.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. The result was that their minds became dark and confused.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Rom 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became utter fools instead.  <br>  Eph 1:2 May grace and peace be yours, sent to you from God our Father and Jesus Christ our Lord.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:3 How we praise God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we belong to Christ.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:4 Long ago, even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:5 His unchanging plan has always been to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. And this gave him great pleasure.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:6 So we praise God for the wonderful kindness he has poured out on us because we belong to his dearly loved Son.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:7 He is so rich in kindness that he purchased our freedom through the blood of his Son, and our sins are forgiven.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:8 He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:9 God's secret plan has now been revealed to us; it is a plan centered on Christ, designed long ago according to his good pleasure.  <br>  <br>  <br>   Eph 1:10 And this is his plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ--everything in heaven and on earth.  <br>  Eph 2:10 For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so that we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.|`|MRUAlbRVaa	This is how Imam Ali (a.s) introduces God:<br>  <br>  Praise is due to Allah whose worth cannot be described by speakers, whose bounties cannot be counted by calculators and whose claim (to obedience) cannot be satisfied by those who attempt to do so, whom the height of intellectual courage cannot appreciate, and the divings of understanding cannot reach; He for whose description no limit has been laid down, no eulogy exists, no time is ordained and no duration is fixed. He brought forth creation through His Omnipotence, dispersed winds through His Compassion, and made firm the shaking earth with rocks. <br>  <br>  The foremost in religion is the acknowledgement of Him, the perfection of acknowledging Him is to testify Him, the perfection of testifying Him is to believe in His Oneness, the perfection of believing in His Oneness is to regard Him Pure, and the perfection of His purity is to deny Him attributes, because every attribute is a proof that it is different from that to which it is attributed and everything to which something is attributed is different from the attribute. Thus whoever attaches attributes to Allah recognises His like, and who recognises His like regards Him two; and who regards Him two recognises parts for Him; and who recognises parts for Him mistook Him; and who mistook Him pointed at Him; and who pointed at Him admitted limitations for Him; and who admitted limitations for Him numbered Him. <br>  <br>  Whoever said in what is He, held that He is contained; and whoever said on what is He held He is not on something else. He is a Being but not through phenomenon of coming into being. He exists but not from non-existence. He is with everything but not in physical nearness. He is different from everything but not in physical separation. He acts but without connotation of movements and instruments. He sees even when there is none to be looked at from among His creation. He is only One, such that there is none with whom He may keep company or whom He may miss in his absence.|`|gC5eFMyTaa	The HOLY BIBLE?  Is the living GOD Breathed word of our LORD.

The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic (self-evident). That’s why the Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’" (Psalm 14:1). The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God, and defends his belief by thinking that the question "Who made God?" can’t be answered. This, he thinks, gives him license to deny the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn’t. If there is a brick wall with "The End" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind the brick wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe (have faith) that space has no beginning and no end. The same applies with God. He has no beginning and no end. He is eternal.<br>  <br>  The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist. That will be called "eternity." God Himself dwells outside of the dimension He created (2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 1:2). He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came into being. He can move through time as a man flips through a history book.<br>  <br>  Because we live in the dimension of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end—by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrums.

oTehE3LIaa	Yes, I think it is sad that some people don't know Jesus.  How do I know that Jesus is real?  I had already been a Christian for awhile when I read through the book of Daniel and studied it.  I was amazed at how it opened my eyes and heart to how real Jesus is.  There is lots of evidence out there that Jesus is for real.  For starters, I know there's no way I could be good enough on my own--that I couldn't ever hope to earn my salvation in light of the holiness of God.  I know that because of the horrible things I have only just thought about, even, that I need a Savior, a perfect Savior, to rescue me...Have you ever felt the same way?|`|69750f25faea5e6021c54c23d0dcb774aa	Why would it scare me?  I am an atheist.  Hardly any of the people I know are atheist.  We just don't ever discuss religion.  It's not their whole life, evidently.  No one I know brings it up.  It's really dumb to discuss religion and politics unless you want an argument.|`|ZUTfMc8vaa	no cause i am not worried about something that i cannot change|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	no|`|LuN1unJ3aa	Not at all. First, they have to have heard of Jesus and for many people in the world, it is not common to their society and therefore, they may not have heard of them. Even in the United States, there are cultures which do not teach or mention Jesus.<br>  <br>  So, no, it doesn't bother me at all. And, having lived in Japan, religion that is foreign to mine is not unusual, either.<br>  <br>  If I had to depend upon man to tell me what religion was "right" or which was "telling the truth" or if I had to depend upon a book, first compiled some 1600 years ago, about a people who lived 2,000 years ago, I'd be in a bad way. The matter would be subject to debate and even being told that "it is a matter of faith" would have little meaning if I started looking at the lives of the people (living or dead) that were involved.<br>  <br>  The only way to know what is true about religion, deity (God), or any other matter having to do with spirituality is to experience it. And for that, I am most thankful.|`|hI1V3SB5aa	OK one at a time!<br>  <br>  Does it scare you that you know someone that don't believe in Jesus?<br>  I mean with me, I would start thinking that believing in Jesus is just a religion.<br>  <br>  Jesus is a person that certain religions claimed existed. He wasn't/isn't a religion in his own right. The religion that most venerates him is Christianity. But he and the religion are not one and the same thing.<br>  <br>  Have you ever thought that believing in Jesus was just a religion?<br>  <br>  Believing in him existing may or may not be. Believing him to the the son of the Abrahamic god would indeed be "just a religion".<br>  <br>  How does it make you feel to know that people believe in other religions?<br>  <br>  To Christianity (or Jesus)? I don't care. I'm not a Christian myself. Do I care that people have religions other than mine? No. My religion doesn't require that everyone follow it.<br>  <br>  How do you know which one is the right religion?<br>  <br>  Different religions are right for different people. Mine is right for me.<br>  <br>  How do you know who is telling the truth?<br>  <br>  You don't. And neither does it matter. Religion is a personal decision that only you can decide on. If you accept it because someone tells you to, then you really have missed the point of it entirely.<br>  <br>  Would it scare you, if you knew someone that didn't believe in Jesus?<br>  <br>  I don't believe in him, and only a handful of people I know *do* believe in him... so no, doesn't scare me. And neither should it scare you. it's better to start concerning yourself more with you religion than that of others.|`|Jkb9kCs6aa	I'm not scared to know myself or my atheist son. <br>  <br>  Religion is a personal matter.

Jesus was real; he lived, he died, and he lives again now.  He died so that YOU could be free of the condition of Sin that plagues your life; He came back to show that Sin and Death have already been conquered and to finish up with His diciples.<br>  <br>  I did once think that the teachings of Jesus was just a religion.  That was part of the reason why I stayed an agnostic for so long.  What you need to know is that Jesus' teachings were not a religion - they were THE TRUTH - THE ONLY TRUTH... and believe so with everything you have and everything you are.<br>  <br>  It makes me feel... frightened to know that people are "born into" and "Loyal to" other religions, or convert from one religion to another.  The teachings of Jesus are NOT religion... they are TRUTH.   Religion is a man-made thing, used to try and keep an omniscient, omnipresent, onmipotent God in a neat little box that they can understand.  God dumbed it all down for us and put it in a book called "The Bible" so that we could understand it WITHOUT having to do the same task.<br>  <br>  There is no "right" religion.  As stated above - Religion is man-made and therefore TOTALLY FALLIBLE.  God's word is TRUTH and NOT FALLIBLE.  Don't follow the religion - Follow the teachings of Christ and see how it lines up with religion.<br>  <br>  Mohammed said, "I point to truth."  Buddha said, "I seek truth."  Jesus said, "I AM truth.  (John 14:6)  If you want to know which "religion" is the right one, use the Bible as your guide... and pray for direction.<br>  <br>  I will FEARFULLY pray for you as I pray FEARFULLY for everyone else on here who doesn't believe that Jesus is, and taught,  the TRUTH.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	Scandinavia must be your hell on earth.|`|7vfoOXknaa	i believe in Jesus but i have loads of friends who don't i pray for them that one day they will find salvation|`|Y6odIQgJaa	It doesn't scare me.

And it is not a religion but a faith within one's heart that He cares about us. If people believe in Darwinism I feel they are lost and only putting their hope in a theory of another human being.  The Bible tells that  pure religion is this to care for the widows and orphans and to visit the sick. And to look to the interest of others besides your own, which I suppose is the same as To love the Lord your God with all your mind,heart and soul, and to love your neighbour as yourself.

But that is no explanation for the ameoba to man evolution.  Where are the transitional fossils????   There should be millions of them - but none exist.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Book of Genesis tells us that everything was created by God—nothing "evolved." Every creature was given the ability to reproduce after its own kind as is stated ten times in Genesis. Dogs do not produce cats. Neither do cats and dogs have a common ancestry. Dogs began as dogs and are still dogs. They vary in species from Chihuahuas to Saint Bernards, but you will not find a "dat" or a "cog" (part cat/dog) throughout God’s creation. Frogs don’t reproduce oysters, cows don’t have lambs, and pregnant pigs don’t give birth to rabbits. God made monkeys as monkeys, and man as man.<br>  <br>  Each creature brings forth after its own kind. That’s no theory; that’s a fact. Why then should we believe that man comes from another species? If evolution is true, then it is proof that the Bible is false. However, the whole of creation stands in contradiction to the theory of evolution.|`|Kz6Dmv2Oaa	Nothing to worry about, because the great thing is, these theories ARE true.

abc5586b3ed239ce0184edfcb1625325aa	Absolutely!.  Whether or not you an athiest does not matter.  What matters is that someone is in need, and here is why:<br>  <br>  31 “When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. 32 Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. 33 And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. 34 Then the King will say to those on his right, ‘Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. 35 For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, 36 I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.’ 37 Then the righteous will answer him, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? 38 And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? 39 And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?’ 40 And the King will answer them, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, [6] you did it to me.’<br>  <br>  41 “Then he will say to those on his left, ‘Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. 42 For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, 43 I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.’ 44 Then they also will answer, saying, ‘Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?’ 45 Then he will answer them, saying, ‘Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.’ 46 And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life.”|`|BRG94d2saa	Sure!<br>  Why not?

That isn't an explanation but it is an answer. What my problems are aren't yours, what your difficulties are aren't mine.

How is that a good reason for me to believe that this person exists? <br>  <br>  After all, it's just your word that he exists. You could show me that person's picture, and how do I know that you are not simply picking a picture out of the internet or doctoring a photo with the two of you?  You could have that person talk to me online or on the phone, but that does not prove to me that you love the person or that this person loves you.<br>  <br>  So, why should I believe you that this person is real? Just because you say so? I have to accept on faith that you do love that person.<br>  <br>  You believe that love exists because you have faith in that love, even on days when you are not happy with that person or that they hurt you. Chances are that this person still loves you. <br>  <br>  It's the same for us. We may not be able to see God, or God's word in the same way that you hear a human voice, but when we seek that relationship with him, we understand what he wants. For us, he's as real as any other person.|`|OfRITFHAaa	They answer that way Jessica , because when you get born again , your spirit is alive , and you can feel Gods presence , and sense God spirit in your spirit . <br>  <br>  People who are not born again are dead , as Jesus said , let the dead bury their dead . <br>  <br>  Can the dead hear ? <br>  <br>  Can the dead see ?<br>  <br>  Can the dead feel ? <br>  <br>  People who have not accepted Christ as savior and who do not walk in the newness of spirit , are dead , and the dead can't Sense God . <br>  <br>  Now as far as me , I have seen Jesus in a vision , heard God's voice 2 times , been healed , felt God's presence even at this moment , and hundreds of other things . <br>  <br>  When a person is born again , they grow , at first the child sees his parents , and does not know the mother from the father . <br>  <br>  But in time , the child grows and then knows the mother , from the father . <br>  <br>  And as the child grows he is able to speak to the parent . <br>  <br>  The christian life is the same , if the person grows in the faith , in time , he knows God more and more .|`|KM2EPk2saa	It is not a good answer. <br>  <br>  However, the concept of a good loving God is real to many people.

No they would go right back to doing it again. And the thing is, people still don't learn from their wrong doing. If a child was to stick his hand on a hot stove, do you think he would have learned not to put his hand on the stove again. Unless of course he likes that sought of thing. Let me ask you this. if your child was to fall while learning to walk, would you intervene and carry him around all the time? If you do that, the child will never learn how to walk on his own. So God let things happen for a reason. People suffer because of the things they put themselves through.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	First, I think that God has amazing plans for mankind in the future, and I think He wants us to see what devastation happens when someone lets their power get to the heads.

Second, even the worst, most horrible, most vile things that happen to us here in this life is nothing but a puff of smoke in the realm of eternity.<br>  What awaits us on the other side so so spectacular so incredible that words cannot describe it; and nothing on earth good or evil can compare to the glory we will experience once we are fully and completely in the presence of God.<br>  <br>  So, in my opinion God allows the suffering to show why we shouldn't turn to evil and cause others to suffer; but even if we do suffer not to worry because we have so much to look forward to regardless.|`|Z6TNsJluaa	He does when People believe but if no one believes in Him, the devil runs rampant bringing total misery upon mankind, but this is not the Will of God.

Why doesn't He stop it?  Can He or is He weaker than we think?  Suffering can fall into three simple categories: emotional, mental, and physical suffering.  But, there are a variety of causes for suffering:  morally corrupt (evil) people, disease, earthquakes, floods, famine, etc.<br>  <br>  There are different explanations for why God allows suffering, but none of them can satisfy everyone.  Therefore, I will simply list various reasons offered to account for suffering and evil in the world.<br>  <a href="http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence-and-answers/if-god-all-powerful-and-loving-why-there-suffering-world" rel="nofollow">http://www.carm.org/apologetics/evidence...</a>|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	He did not intervene when His own Son suffered on the cross, He has a purpose for all things|`|Ez9NB86Iaa	Gave us the choice to leave the garden of eden and make our own choices, read the bible before you question it|`|pqqKLCmwaa	Pain is nature's (God's ) way of telling you that something's wrong.

Of course I believe in reincarnation, and we keep coming back ,getting chances to get things more and more right,improving our lives ,and future ones. That's the only way a gracious God could have it. It is impossible to learn all we need to in one life,especially when some of us are born handicapped. They can't be held to the same standards as those who are physically and mentally competent. No one goes to Hell just because they never heard of Jesus, or have heard but choose not to believe something written in an old book with no proof, while other ppl push their book with equal zeal.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	By not intervening, he accomplishes the following:<br>  * Trials to test and strengthen our faith.<br>  * Reasons to bless and reward the righteous<br>  * Reasons not to bless or reward the wicked (he's really not interested in punishing anybody, no matter what you might hear)<br>  * The maturation we need before he can even think of letting us sit down with Jesus in Jesus' throne and rule kingdoms (or worlds) in his name.<br>  * Opportunities for us to get off our rear ends and learn love through service to God's children.|`|BlA60kDVaa	Nothing is disapproved by God.

Now within the context of what serves you, or dis-serves you on your path of evolution - only you can decide that.|`|5c9011543d498dda04d1562813072559aa	The question of why a righteous and loving God allows evil to exist is almost as old as the human race. Over 3,000 years ago, Job asked, "Why do the wicked live on, growing old and increasing in power? ... Yet they say to God, 'Leave us alone! We have no desire to know your ways'" (Job 21:7, 14).<br>  <br>  Nor does the Bible give us a complete answer to this puzzle. Someday in heaven we'll fully understand God's ways—but not now. We live in a fallen world, a world where evil often seems to be in control. But that isn't the whole story! By faith we know that God still loves us, and His power is greater than all evil. The proof is Jesus Christ, who was put to death by evil men but rose from the dead by the power of God. Never forget this truth: Ultimately, God is in control, not Satan.<br>  <br>  And someday God's justice and power will rule, and all evil will be destroyed. Satan will be bound forever, and Jesus Christ will reign over all the earth. In the meantime, we say with the Bible, "How unsearchable are his judgments, and his ways past finding out!" (Romans 11:33).<br>  <br>  The real question, however, is this: Is your trust in God? In the midst of so much confusion and doubt in the world, have you put your faith in Christ, and are you seeking to follow Him every day? Make sure of your commitment to Christ, and then make it your goal to grow closer to Him every day.|`|HRUkmBBxaa	lol.. i think if people pray and really mean it ,God can answer there prayers and remove that suffering it all goes down to really mean it when praying to God and believe that he will answer|`|Ii0Kd6hdaa	Because God works in mysterious, inefficient, and breathtakingly cruel ways.|`|XcL6eitsaa	*************<br>  ***************<br>  <br>  Because people prefer to say it's Satan who make people suffer and stuff !<br>  <br>  People only read Job when they want to perform some kind of adoration to evil but people don't read well Job explained it was God who killed his 10 sons and stuff !<br>  <br>  How is if a Sheriff do business with killers just to see if the people who voted for him still talk nice about him ? <br>  <br>  Job is a part of the Bible that confess the Bible is wrong and is for preachers to say evil is nice if done to others and not to them !<br>  <br>  As i said: " Preachers are Evil's Shitt !

We humans have enough imagination that our grasping can always exceed what we have, so we can always cause ourselves suffering, by asking the impossible- like you asking this question and then specifying that you don't want to hear the real, true answer.  That kind of behaviour will only lead you to dissatisfaction which even feelings of moral superiority can't ease.  Sorry!|`|Kl56NSmLaa	Really, it's no bother at all - HE DOESN'T EXIST. And that's a serious answer.|`|Km6QTk9Caa	Why does god (If god exists to you) then why does he stand back and allow suffering?<br>  What are your thoughts on Your own question Bas Ruten?. <br>  <br>  You throw the question out here,  but you make stipulations about what answers you are willing to hear.<br>  So what is your answer?<br>  <br>  Here's mine.<br>  <br>  I no longer believe in the christian god,  and I am closer to believing there is not even A god or any kind of higher power.<br>  <br>  How do you explain the successful landing of a plane upon the Hudson river,  everyone survives?    Oh glory to god,  praise him,  what a miracle!<br>  <br>  Then a couple weeks later another plane crashes and everyone on board dies  and I am sure suffering went on.    <br>  <br>  You can't have it both ways,  so god must be the cause of this too.  Right?    god is given credit for the first incident,    so why not the second.   <br>  <br>  Why did god (if he exists) saved everyone on the first plane and then wiped everyone out on the second?<br>  <br>  Two babies are born with identical horrendous health problems,  god allows one to die and the other to live.    <br>  <br>  Explain this?<br>  <br>  No one can,   again it is all opinionated,  speculative type answers,  because no one f**cking knows.    <br>  <br>  The answers I think are the most distasteful and I abhor are the ones from those who mentioned sin in the person's life.<br>  Yeh a new born baby.  Make it suffer.   The hungry children in third world countries,  yeh,  a make them suffer.   To teach mankind a lesson.   It is sick and twisted thinking.<br>  <br>   Because of the "original sin" of thousands of years ago committed by supposedly the "first" man and woman.  Because of them is why there is suffering and pain today.<br>  That is one hell of a punishment,  thousands of years of punishment to mankind.<br>  christians,   you gotta think why you believe what you believe.   Why just accept what is spoon fed to you?<br>  Oh god's ways are higher than ours.   This is the biggest cop out answer.<br>  And Superb90's answer is the one that wants to make me hurl.<br>  That is the most quoted scripture to give when no one can come up with an answer.   What a cop out.   <br>  god works things out for the good.    That is so typical,   stereotypical answer,   you just spew out the same sentiments that I have heard from so many christians.   <br>  Well god works things out what was meant for evil for the good.<br>  Again go back to the scenarios I mentioned up above.<br>  <br>  So which plane crash was meant for evil?   And god will work out for the good.<br>  So everyone on the first plane loved the Lord?<br>  <br>  Which sick baby was meant for evil?  and god will work out the situation for good.<br>  Which one of these babies didn't love the Lord?<br>  <br>  Remember babies aren't able to think,  they can't make choices.   <br>  <br>  So how does that scripture apply in this case?|`|5rP0zBudaa	Whats 2+2 ? serious answers only please.<br>  <br>  If you are going to say "4" don't bother<br>  <br>  (sorry i couldnt resist it)|`|1cfa3610b6d1b6140a73170b42273c55aa	We could have stayed in the Garden of Eden and everything would have been taken care of, but we chose to leave and to take responsibility for our own lives.

It's not God, we let it happen, not him.|`|3KD6RRhPaa	God has given in man's DNA  a concience, and this concience becomes his judge. It tells him what is right and what is wrong. Many follow this judge, and also many follow its ethical and moral obligations, and the result is a peaceful and restful village.   But there are some individuals who allow their conciences to be seared as with a hot iron, by foolowing after things that destroy mankind in many evil ways, and they get a kick out of killing, raping and destroying this peaceful village of people.<br>  <br>  So why blame God for everything that goes wrong in that village of restful people living by their consciences.<br>  <br>  Jesus taught us in mark 7:20-23 that every man woman and child has been born with 12 types of sin, and its this sin that is causing all these problems.<br>  <br>  God did come and intervened in our situation by sending His only begotten Son to the earth nearly 2000 years ago to take away the sins of this world with His water baptism by John the Baptist and His death on the Cross in our stead (1 John 5:6-11).<br>  <br>  So to live in the realm of God on this earth as a righteous person and no longer resting only by our judge, we must believe in this full and complete atonement for sins and not in half of it (only the blood on the Cross) as many people do today, making God so very angry.<br>  <br>  Grab for yourself some Free Christian Books by going to me Avatar and logging onto one of those websites.|`|O5KOwhovaa	Because he doesn't exist.<br>  <br>  <br>  Denying that most obvious of answers is part of the problem.<br>  <br>  Why look for supernatural explanations when the most logical one is staring at you in the face?|`|mmMgfhf2aa	Think about it.

Suffering is temporary(whether short or long) but the outcome of that often last longer. I feel that he is teaching us a lesson. It is often when going through trials and tribulation that we seek him and his word for peace. He will work things out for you in his time and in his way. Often times what we want for ourselves is not what God has for us or his ulitmate plan for us or is not the best thing.|`|9sRH0Bjtaa	i think to myself that god always does something for something else to happen good.

If a paedophile is a devout person, should his crimes be excused? Whatever we enjoy or suffer is the fruits of our deeds or simply our karma. The law is the same for all.

No amount of money will save us from it.<br>  <br>  That is a very difficult question. I know that God does not want us to suffer neadlessly. I know He suffers along with us when ever we do suffer. He is very careful not to break His promise on our free will that He blessed us with and they may cause us to not choose His help. He also loves all us the same reguardless of sin or religion. I do not understand His plans, but I do know He make allotment for suffering on Earth and in Heaven. Offer your sufferring up to Him for the salvation of souls and know, as long as Evil is in this world, there will be suffering. <br>  <br>  God allowed ST. Paul to be lost in the Ocean for a day. He let him drift in the water until he was rescued. John the baptist had his head decapitated. Jesus came to him in jail and John greatly grieved the fact Jesus would not release him. St. Bernadette of Lourdes had the faith to find the healing waters, but she herself died of a very painful illness. Padre Pio suffered his whole life. They all where given great gifts along with it. What does this say to you?<br>  <br>  I know in my suffering, loosing people, my Mother, and having a brain tumor, the pain of those events was nothing compared to being away from God. I think even though God does NOT want suffering, when it happens HE can use it for good, for saving souls. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure why some are saved from suffering and some are called to it. I think the important question is if God is with us.|`|CT265lQyaa	If you are going to say "serious answers only", then don't say "don't bother saying because he doesn't exist"...|`|gknPGlDCaa	Maybe God doesnt intervene because he created nature and he must let nature take its course.

All the things you listed were known way before Muhammad wrote them.  Look at all the astronomy that was known at that time, and mathematics...the things you listed were common natural processes that would be learned just from watching nature.

The water cycle was well known to the Greeks, hundreds of years before Mohammad was born. Mohammad copied many Greek scientific misconceptions. The proof of that is in the Qur'an. For example, sperm does not come from between the ribs and spine. How do the misconceptions of Ancient Greek scientists wind up in the Qur'an? Mohammad had ears and a good memory.

Rain falls from clouds, that's not so hard to see. Plants grow with water, wither without it. Not very difficult. There is little mention of the process of evaporation in these texts, and it's role in cloud formation. So half the cycle seems to be missing.<br>  I rather think these passages are a metaphor for His good grace than a scientific observation, though, so maybe the evaporation part is not needed to illustrate that point.|`|uJO0MbShaa	The history of agriculture goes back 10,000 years!

2nRjy734aa	If we continue to say a person can label themselves as "whatever they want", we open the door to anyone falsely laying claim to another race's history and achievements. History books in the future may reflect that, giving the wrong people claim to something they did not achieve. False labeling should be discouraged. You are what God made you-period. <br>  <br>  Other than freedom of speech, biracial people should identify as such, or be categorized as what they are - biracial.  Being two races and identifiying as one advocates segregation. It also perpetuates the identity issues that many biracial children face. These celebrities who falsely label themselves as "black", in all honesty, are not doing so because they "choose" to, they are doing it because, unfortuately, most of society accepts it and the black community encourages it ( <a href="http://bbsnews.net/article.php/20061222014017231" rel="nofollow">http://bbsnews.net/article.php/200612220...</a> ). The scrutiny Tiger Woods faced after labeling himself biracial is a perfect example. <br>  <br>  It does not matter what Tiger Woods "looks like" or is "treated" as now or 50 years ago. That does not change what he is. All races have a history of mis-treatment. That doesn't make them black. Forcing a "black" label on a half white person appeases the racists that treated him that way. The fact that biracial people can begin to finally acknowledge *all* of their ancestry is evidence that that type of "treatment" is changing. Anybody advocating a "black" label for a biracial person perpetuates that "treatment", and the very label itself promotes segregation.  <br>  <br>  We should be encouraging biracial people to love and embrace *all* of themselves. Biracial people have a unique history and life that is all but forgotten. I think we need a NAABP (National Association for the Acknowledgement of Biracial People). And no, that would not further devide the races. What better way to UNITE blacks and whites than by recognizing a black and white person as both? People like Berry and Obama are living in the past. <br>  <br>  I added you as a contact. I applaud you for your bravery and level-headedness in acknowledging who you are! Don't give up.

They are not the spokespersons for the entire group of biracial people.  There are, and have been for hundreds of years, a majority black/white biracial people who have identified solely as Black.  This is the reality demonstrated in numbers according to the United States Census over many decades.  The 2010 census is going to be the most important census in our nation's history and it'll be interesting to see how most black/white biracials check off the race boxes.  I understand that checking "all that apply" simply retabulates b/w biracial again to the Black race when it comes to tabulations needed to maintain our nations important civil rights laws.   Since there is no official "mulatto" race, what is the problem with mulattoes also identifying as Black--as well as identifying as biracial?  After all, mixed race people have always been members of the black race and community since the early 1600's in this country.  And I would think that the majority of mulattoes today, look more black than they look white.  So they'll be perceived by most people as black.  Nothing wrong with that.|`|3hYUNHphaa	i've said it before and i'll say it again, if someone doesn't want to be identified as biracial, it is their own business, and a decision that that person has made out of their own experiences. i believe that we should not judge them based on the decision they have made and just accept it.|`|AA11926458	I think the bigger question is {not whether some people should racially identify themselves as "Biracial"} but why do YOU care what hundreds of thousands of complete strangers identify themselves as?|`|WuPwWf0faa	thats a very good video. maybe you should see this one. around the 4:00 mintue mark..<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBvXHQ3V7sE" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UBvXHQ3V7...</a>|`|8N4aPcpaaa	lol first of all where have you been mariah carey claimed white until ebony busted her out so she doesnt claim biracial by choice|`|Dv5HiSSraa	I'm African thus black.

Perhaps they've heard other people talk about it, or they may have been exposed to it slightly when they were children—but they haven't seriously examined it for themselves. But since the Bible claims to answer life's deepest questions, doesn't it make sense to at least listen to what it has to say? Of course it does.<br>  <br>  This is why I challenge you to discover the Bible for yourself. Take one of the Gospels (which tell us about the life of Jesus) and read through it carefully. (I often recommend people start with the Gospel of John.) As you do, ask yourself if it sounds like something people just made up, or if instead it rings true.<br>  <br>  I think you'll find it rings true—and for a very good reason: Jesus Christ really lived, and He really showed us what God is like. As Peter later wrote, "We did not follow cleverly invented stories when we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty" (2 Peter 1:16).

It has had more prophecies come true than any other document ever written.   3.   Jesus is just plain awesome... I would rather believe there is life after death and a heaven and hell, and find its all fake; rather than not believe and end up in an eternity of pain and suffering.  4.

I accept that my evidence does not constitute proof nor should it even constitute "evidence" for anyone else, especially someone that doesn't even know me well enough to determine whether or not my experiences or my assessment of them are genuine.  <br>  <br>  I also accept that my "evidence" rests on a foundation of "faith"...and that someone who doesn't share that faith could legitimately dismiss it as biased...as long as they concede that their own evidence is biased in the same manner.  All evidence is biased by the assumptions we make about unknown (and unknowable) factors that may (or may not) influence our observations.As such, it is hardly suprising that the initial assumptions a person makes about the existence of God has such an obvious impact on what a person "sees" when they read the bible. A person without faith in God reads the bible looking for evidence it is false and finds "a bunch of jibber jabber" written by "a bunch of men".  A person with faith in God reads the bible looking for a message from God and finds information that proves itself so valuable in their life that "a bunch of men" who lived thousands of years ago and didn't even know each other couldn't possibly have known let alone communicated it so well and so consistently.<br>  <br>  The interesting thing is that the bible says it will work exactly the way it does work...that those with faith will be able to hear the voice of God while those that aren't willing to "believe without seeing" will be blind to any evidence of his existence.  Face it, the issue of God's existence is a choice not a decision...the initial assumption we make about God determines the way we will perceive and interpret everything we hear and read and see.  <br>  <br>  The sad/unfortunate thing is that many people don't realize they made that initial assumption before they read one word of the bible.  The very first time their brain entertained the idea that a "creator-god" may exist they chose to assume that it was true or false pending further investigation.  The "null" position says that I will not believe until I can collect evidence to determine if it is true, the alternate position says, I will believe it is true until I can collect evidence that it is false. <br>  <br>  The result is that people who already assumed the null position believe that they made a sincere effort to find evidence to support the alternate position in the bible and, finding nothing but "jibber jabber", dismiss the bible as worthless fiction...never realizing that their choice to assume the null position made it impossible for them to perceive the evidence that was right in front of them!|`|j5YwuVEIaa	Here is a wonderful article. PLEASE read with the bible. The prophecy alone will show you that this book truly is the 'inspired word of God'. The things he inspired the writers to write are being fulfilled even as we speak. <br>  <br>  Also, it is the longest surviving book in history.....1000s of years is  not by accident.<br>  <br>  Chapter Two<br>  The Bible—A Book From God<br>  In what ways is the Bible different from any other book?<br>  How can the Bible help you cope with personal problems?<br>  Why can you trust the prophecies recorded in the Bible?<br>  CAN you recall a time when you received a fine gift from a dear friend? Likely, the experience was not only exciting but also heartwarming. After all, a gift tells you something about the giver—that he or she values your friendship. No doubt you expressed gratitude for your friend’s thoughtful gift.<br>  2 The Bible is a gift from God, one for which we can be truly grateful. This unique book reveals things that we could never find out otherwise. For example, it tells us about the creation of the starry heavens, the earth, and the first man and woman. The Bible contains reliable principles to help us cope with life’s problems and anxieties. It explains how God will fulfill his purpose and bring about better conditions on the earth. What an exciting gift the Bible is!<br>  3 The Bible is also a heartwarming gift, for it reveals something about the Giver, Jehovah God. The fact that he has provided such a book is proof that he wants us to get to know him well. Indeed, the Bible can help you to draw close to Jehovah.<br>  4 If you have a copy of the Bible, you are far from alone. In whole or in part, the Bible has been published in more than 2,300 languages and thus is available to more than 90?percent of the world’s population. On the average, more than a million Bibles are distributed each week! Billions of copies of either the whole Bible or part of it have been produced. Surely, there is no other book like the Bible.<br>  5 Furthermore, the Bible “is inspired of God.” (2?Timothy 3:16) In what way? The Bible itself answers: “Men spoke from God as they were borne along by holy spirit.” (2?Peter 1:21) To illustrate: A businessman might have a secretary write a letter. That letter contains the businessman’s thoughts and instructions. Hence, it is really his letter, not the secretary’s. In a similar way, the Bible contains God’s message, not that of the men who wrote it down. Thus, the entire Bible truthfully is “the word of God.”—1?Thessalonians 2:13.<br>  HARMONIOUS AND ACCURATE<br>  6 The Bible was written over a 1,600-year period. Its writers lived at different times and came from many walks of life. Some were farmers, fishermen, and shepherds. Others were prophets, judges, and kings. The Gospel writer Luke was a doctor. Despite the varied backgrounds of its writers, the Bible is harmonious from beginning to end.<br>  7 The first book of the Bible tells us how mankind’s problems began. The last book shows that the whole earth will become a paradise, or garden. All the material in the Bible covers thousands of years of history and relates in some way to the unfolding of God’s purpose. The harmony of the Bible is impressive, but that is what we would expect of a book from God.<br>  8 The Bible is scientifically accurate. It even contains information that was far ahead of its time. For example, the book of Leviticus contained laws for ancient Israel on quarantine and hygiene when surrounding nations knew nothing about such matters. At a time when there were wrong ideas about the shape of the earth, the Bible referred to it as a circle, or sphere. (Isaiah 40:22) The Bible accurately said that the earth ‘hangs on nothing.’ (Job 26:7) Of course, the Bible is not a science textbook. But when it touches on scientific matters, it is accurate. Is this not what we would expect of a book from God?<br>  9 The Bible is also historically accurate and reliable. Its accounts are specific. They include not only the names but also the ancestry of individuals. In contrast to secular historians, who often do not mention the defeats of their own people, Bible writers were honest, even recording their own failings and those of their nation. In the Bible book of Numbers, for instance, the writer Moses admits his own serious error for which he was severely reproved. (Numbers?20:2-12) Such honesty is rare in other historical accounts but is found in the Bible because it is a book from God.<br>  A BOOK OF PRACTICAL WISDOM<br>  10 Because the Bible is inspired of God, it is “beneficial for teaching, for reproving, for setting things straight.” (2?Timothy 3:16) Yes, the Bible is a practical book. It reflects a keen understanding of human nature. No wonder, for its Author, Jehovah God, is the Creator! He understands our thinking and emotions better than we do. Furthermore, Jehovah knows what we need in order to be happy. He also knows what pathways we should avoid.<br>  11 Consider Jesus’ speech called the Sermon on the Mount, recorded in Matthew chapters?5 to?7.|`|FI916ISFaa	We know that the Bible is the word of God because it says so in the Bible.<br>  <br>  Best example of circular reasoning there is.|`|eph8JOhBaa	faith, blind faith!

My grandparents had eleven children.  It would take remarkably little time to populate the earth at that rate.  For example, Australia imported some rabbits, they got loose, and in a very few years they had overrun one half of Australia so much that they built a fence ACROSS AUSTRALIA to try to limit their spread.  <br>  <br>  Remember, population growth is exponential.

There are 18 generations from Adam to Noah (1656 years). The Bible tells us Adam and Eve had at least three sons and three daughters, and Noah had at least three sons. <br>  Thus, using the formula 2(3)^n, we can determine approximately the number of people at the end of each generation. So, after the first generation there were 2 x 3^1 = 6 people. After the second generation there were 2 x 3^2 = 18 people. After 17 generations there would have been around 258 million people and after 18 generations there were 774 million people. <br>  This doesn't take into account the fact portions of previous generations would have been alive while the current generation is alive, nor does it take into account the lack of contraception which meant the number of offspring of each generation was probably more than 3 boys and 3 girls. <br>  Therefore, on the basis of the information provided in the Bible, the evidence is the world wide population of mankind could easily have attained the population we now have.

kavhzTXgaa	If it is more acceptable it shouldn't be. Abuse of any kind is wrong. But i understand your question. Would the cops take it as seriously if it were two women fighting vs a man fighting a woman?.. Good Question Mins|`|kclpa0Abaa	It is overlooked. People don't realize the psychological side of abuse. Or the other sides. All the see is the fact that a woman, supposedly, can't defend herself against a man. So if there is 2 men/women, people just think, "well you should be able to defend yourself" or, think that's it's equal. Some women are way stronger than other women and same thing applies to men. <br>  <br>  The reasons abusive relationships exist go beyond strength. It's also people who have connections that make it hard, like they share a home or finances or children. The abusee may depend on the abuser financially or ironically, emotionally.<br>  <br>  The abusee can still be threntened. And the availibaility of shelters and services for LGBT abuse survivors are just about non-existent, especially for men. There are no battered men's shelters. And lesbians can experience discrimination and insensitivity in the system, a lot of what happens to LGBT youths in NY when it comes to foster care, homelessness and the juvenile justice system.|`|FpMS47sXaa	I do not think it's more common with gay people, if that is what you are driving at.<br>  <br>  I also agree that no abuse of any sort should be tolerated.|`|LURqbzoZaa	No, it is not acceptable ever, in any situation.

At the time I heard it, I was surprised but it made me think. Over time, I developed my arguments.<br>  <br>  As you say, common sense points that way. To explain God, people devise ever more tortuous arguments and finish by saying that He (She?) is a mystery that we should not question. But science progresses by questioning. 500 years ago, we knew far less than we know now. If you ask a scientific question that no one can answer, that does not mean that the answer is "God"; it means that we must search harder until we find the answer. I am confident that in another 500 years many of today's scientific questions will have been answered, leaving even less room for "God".<br>  <br>  The existence of different religions, each with its own book, contradicting each other also points to the absurdity of the idea. All these books were penned by humans. If God were directing these humans' hands, He could at least have given them consistent stories.|`|CejuzMycaa	I've have never been part of a religion, but as a child I was a deist. I think the design argument was the only factor that kept me believing. As a child my family took me to church and sunday school. I believed in an all powerful, all knowing creator. I often questioned this believe especially when I found out about things like the tooth fairy, santa claus, the baby bringing stork etc. I realized that lot's of people (kids) believed in these things without evidence and they weren't true, so why couldn't god be the same (Large numbers of people believing something doesn't validate it). The thing that kept bringing me back was that I couldn't explain how my parents parents parents..... had come into existence.<br>  At sunday school I heard the bible stories of the old testament and completely rejected them for several reasons. The god in them was child like, seemed less moral and reasonable than me, and he could be persuaded by men (eg moses persuading god not to kill the jews for building a false idol), he generally didn't fit the profile of the god I believed in. I was also horrified by many of the stories like god rewarding Abraham's willingness to kill his own son. I began to wonder if my dad would consider such a thing as a righteous act. To my relief I later found out that he wasn't a Christian.<br>  Although I believed in an all powerful god I didn't believe in miracles simply because they just didn't make sense to me. Nothing can go against the laws nature, but there are laws of nature that we do not yet know. For something to happen, it needs possible, if it's possible it can't be a miracle.<br>  I also rejected the idea of Jesus being the son of god. I liked a lot of the jesus teachings, but the god I then believed in, could never be contained in human form. My god was perfect and infinite, so could not be put in such an imperfect shell. Also the miracles he performed made me question him.<br>  I think another big factor in my rejection of religion was that my parents told me about lots the other religions and I saw how they all contradicted each other. I knew that most of them logically had to be wrong and I had no reason to believe any one of them was right.<br>  I think the discovery of evolution in my early teens got rid of my deism. I simply no longer had a reason to believe in a god. I still didn't know the answer to the origin of the universe, but to confine a god to that (a switch flipper) seemed pathetic/pointless. I'd spent my whole life asking questions, observing the world around me finding answers to things I previously didn't know. I wasn't likely to start worshipping a god of such small gaps.|`|Jkb9kCs6aa	I was a pastor's wife and very involved in many aspects of the church. While studying for my next lesson to the teen ministries I started having more and more trouble finding "real" answers for the myriad of questions that my students had. I couldn't just gloss over them anymore. I even used literal language concordances to try and find an answer but ended up with more questions.<br>  <br>  It was a life changing decision to give up belief and religion. I lost my husband, my job, my standing in the community and even had to move because the Christians I left behind got so nasty with me. I got tired of being told I was going to hell, or being called a devil worshiper.|`|UFMvhn2Gaa	I had just looked at many peoples' perception of God, read through a few Bible, Qu'ran, and Torah passages, and read many religious, and non-religious peoples' opinions on the matter. Also, to be totally honest, too much has happened to me, and to the world for me to believe that there is a divine being capable of doing good.|`|li22L9gZaa	My beliefs became increasingly liberal as I began to learn what evolution actually was and as I learned to be more tolerant of other views.  Meeting a number of non-Christians in college helped me realize how unjust the whole believe or burn policy was.  I soon just kind of realized how much I didn't believe when I was confronted about why I was a Christian by an atheist friend.  I was making the usual arguments, i.e. argument from design, cosmological argument etc. and realized as I was reciting them that I didn't really buy what I was saying.  Then I became an agnostic.  The full-blown atheism came later.

They did this for some weeks when Joseph and his brothers convinced Josiah to stop the quest.  No treasure was found.<br>  <br>  Encyclopedia of Mormonism, 1-4 vols., edited by Daniel H. Ludlow (New York: Macmillan, 1992),, p.1348<br>  The Smiths purchased a 100-acre farm in Manchester, New York, soon after their arrival from Vermont in 1816, but lost it in 1825 when they were unable to make the final yearly payment of $100. In an effort to raise the money, Joseph, Sr., and his son Joseph joined Josiah Stowell in a venture to dig for purported treasure in Harmony, Pennsylvania. Critics of the Smith family have used this incident as evidence of their interest in money digging. While the practice of seeking buried treasure was common at that time in the Northeast and Joseph, Sr., may have participated in searching for it, his digging for Stowell was a desperate attempt to earn money to meet a mortgage payment. After they lost their farm, the Smiths again became tenant farmers.|`|wRIF7SSnaa	Yes that is true. Joseph Smith had some good Tall tales that tricked many people. He had said before his mormon Theology was gathered, that he was a Psychic medium and he could find gold using some weird methods. He was in fact a very troubled child growing up and almost landed in jail for stealing food from a neighbor. I would not be surprised if he also invented that an angel came to him and gave him a book to which humans had to pay a vast amount of land and money to their church. In fact, in the book of mormon, vast amount of power was giving to him, that he is more important than jesus. That's why many people With Phd.'s claim that mormons aren't christians and more of cult. They claim that the end of people's death that Joseph Smith alone will judge if you were a good person and not jesus. They also claim that god can have sex and that jesus and the devil are brothers that dint get along. That's why they have been criticized over the ages among several criminal offenses of bigamy and embezzlement. I hope this helps.|`|TzY9vkinaa	He was mighty poor for being accused of stealing people's money...|`|UWKF7x4faa	Yes - he was a pure charlatan.|`|Kwfo0aRvaa	“Now, most historians, Mormon or not, who work with the sources, accept as fact Joseph Smith’s career as village magician. Too many of his closest friends and family admitted as much, and some of Joseph’s own revelations support the contention.”  Richard L. Bushman, Mormon historian, “Treasure-seeking Then and Now,” Sunstone, v. 11, September 1987, p. 5<br>  <br>      "When Joseph Smith recalled his money-digging activities for his official history, he wrote only about searching for a lost mine in 1825 for Josiah Stowell. But contemporary records suggest that this had been one of the Smith family occupations in the Palmyra/Manchester area since the early 1820s. For example, Joshua Stafford of Manchester recalled that he ‘became acquainted with the family of Joseph Smith, Sen. about the year 1819 or 20. They then were laboring people, in low circumstances. A short time after this, they commenced digging for hidden treasures,…and told marvellous stories about ghosts, hob-goblins, caverns, and various other mysterious matters.’ Willard Chase, another friend of the family, similarly recalled, ‘I became acquainted with the Smith family…in the year 1820. At that time they were engaged in the money digging business.’" (Inventing Mormonism, Marquardt and Walters, p.64)<br>  <br>      As early as 1822 Joseph Smith was connected with the magic "seer stone" he found while digging a well for a Mr. Chase. Joseph and his father later joined with a group of men to search for buried treasures, aided by Smith’s stone. In 1825, after hearing of Smith’s powers, Josiah Stowell came to Palmyra to hire the Smiths to help him look for a silver mine in Pennsylvania.<br>  <br>      Smith’s mother relates that Mr. Stowell specifically sought out Joseph Smith due to his special powers. Lucy Smith wrote:<br>  <br>      "A short time before the house was completed [1825], a man by the name of Josiah Stoal came from Chenango county, New York, with the view of getting Joseph to assist him in digging for a silver mine. He came for Joseph on account of having heard that he posssessed certain means by which he could discern things invisible to the natural eye."

Including the fact that he did use a "seer stone" in a top hat in which he placed his face to see where ancient treasures might be or where there might be a vein of gold etc.. I also accept the fact that he shunned this practice as he devoted himself to what he believed was the work of God and suffered greatly in poverty, under persecution, and threat of mob for what he professed his religion to be.|`|62s7J8sHaa	No.<br>  <br>  My mother was a "born again" Christian and heard/read all the lies that are spread by those trying to get rich off of those who will believe those lies. Fortunately, my mother is quite intelligent. She wasn't gullible enough to just believe those "truths" that preachers were spreading. She researched the Mormons using their literature in addition to the anti-Mormon garbage. <br>  <br>  After a year of study, research, and sincere prayer she learned from God that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Christ's true church on the earth. That was over 40 years ago.<br>  <br>  I feel sorry for you that you believe the same tired, old lies that have been around for so long.<br>  <br>  Here's a question for you: If Mormonism is a Joseph Smith - worshiping cult, why didn't it just dry up and blow away when he died, just like every cult does when its leader dies?<br>  <br>  Another question: Since we supposedly worship Joseph Smith, why don't people say that we worship Thomas S. Monson, our current prophet? If we worshiped our prophets, maybe that would explain why ours is one of the fastest-growing churches in the world?<br>  <br>  I know that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is the only church with God's authority. While other churches have truth, the only source of God's continuing revelation to the world is found with the Mormons. <br>  <br>  We respect others' right to believe as they wish, and expect the same from others. There are no sermons ever given at our churches that are anti-Baptist, -Catholic, -Jew, -Muslim or any other religion in the world.

When you spend hours texting or on your email, it can take away from prayer time, time for helping others, etc. Is it a sin to eat meat on Fridays? Friday is the day that Christ died on the cross and so fasting and prayer is the order of the day. My church has that too but I don't follow it. I'm trying to fast for Lent...Orthodox don't eat meat for 40 days. I haven't been able to do it. In fact, I just ate meat this morning by accident. Don't look at these as sins.

But they deliberately forget that long ago by God's word the heavens existed and the earth was formed out of water and by water. By these waters also the world of that time was deluged and destroyed. By the same word the present heavens and earth are reserved for fire, being kept for the day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men.But do not forget this one thing, dear friends: With the Lord a day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a day.

NFK3A68oaa	Hospitals are noted for being fair and impartial, and treat all patients the same, respecting their beliefs.  <br>  <br>  However, Jehovah's witnesses beliefs, including the Bible's command to "abstain from...blood", at Acts of the Apostles (or just, "Acts")15:28,29, are a protection in many ways.  A prominent U.S.medical journal once noted that 10,000 Americans alone, in one year alone, died just from the three main complications of blood transfusions--hepatitis B, hemolytic reactions and mistakes in cross-matching.  There are many more complications than this, including, of course, AIDS.  Using a safe transfusion alternative, such as saline solution, Dextran, etc. avoids these dangers.<br>  <br>  Also, to avoid use of transfusions, skilled and dedicated surgeons have developed many special techniques to operate without losing much blood--laser surgery, electrocautery (using a hot scalpel that cauterizes as it cuts), thorough clamping of bleeding vessels.  This precise surgery now permits surgeons to perform open heart surgery on infants while losing only a teaspoonful of blood!<br>  <br>  So getting bloodless surgery assures you of not only avoiding the dangers inherent in blood transfusions, but of getting the most precise surgery.<br>  <br>  A side benefit is that you recover from surgery faster and with less danger of serious internal infection, a constant worry with surgery.  Another important benefit, if you have to have cancer surgery, is reduced risk of the cancer spreading or coming back somewhere else, since your immune system is free to hunt down and kill left-over cancer "seed cells" instead of  being kept busy killing off and digesting billions of foreign blood cells from a blood transfusion.  Remember, blood is a tissue, and you know about tissue rejection in transplants.  All "foreign" blood cells must be eventually destroyed and eliminated by the immune system.  And if it's working on that, it's not working on finding and destroying cancer cells. One medical journal said, "The cancer surgeon of the future may well need to become a bloodless surgeon."<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Michael|`|b77af9f788ecbbd1984a5e2166b0d0ceaa	Tell your mother that she does not need to say she's one of Jehovah's Witnesses to get this bloodless treatment.

It has been observed that patients who receive such treatments sometimes fare better and recover quicker from surgery.<br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses do not refuse medical treatment, unless it involves the use of whole blood or plasma.  In such cases, safe alternatives are available, which do not involve the transmission of pathogens and  blood-borne diseases, as could happen with blood transfusions.|`|yz6qXwUiaa	Yes we get excellent medical care without the use of Blood.  There is more to it than saying you are a Witness though.

They work with the doctors and educate them and coordinate with other hosptals or other doctors so that we can receive the kind of care we need without compromising our stand on blood.  Since these doctors are so experienced with Jehovah's Witness patients and with the procedures done without blood, it is EXCELLENT care.|`|AA10024451	No, that is not true.

God has said:<br>  <br>  “But whoever turns away from the Quran,  he will have a hard life, and We will raise him up blind on the Day of Judgment.” (Quran 20:124)<br>  <br>  This may explain why some people commit suicide while they enjoy the material comfort money can buy.

pj2bnJgjaa	To one who examines the evidence, there can be no doubt that God exists. Every building has a builder. Everything made has a maker. The fact of the existence of the Creator is axiomatic (self-evident). That’s why the Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart, ‘There is no God’" (Psalm 14:1). The professing atheist denies the common sense given to him by God, and defends his belief by thinking that the question "Who made God?" can’t be answered. This, he thinks, gives him license to deny the existence of God.<br>  <br>  The question of who made God can be answered by simply looking at space and asking, "Does space have an end?" Obviously, it doesn’t. If there is a brick wall with "The End" written on it, the question arises, "What is behind the brick wall?" Strain the mind though it may, we have to believe (have faith) that space has no beginning and no end. The same applies with God. He has no beginning and no end. He is eternal.<br>  <br>  The Bible also informs us that time is a dimension that God created, into which man was subjected. It even tells us that one day time will no longer exist. That will be called "eternity." God Himself dwells outside of the dimension He created (2 Timothy 1:9, Titus 1:2). He dwells in eternity and is not subject to time. God spoke history before it came into being. He can move through time as a man flips through a history book.<br>  <br>  Because we live in the dimension of time, logic and reason demand that everything must have a beginning and an end. We can understand the concept of God’s eternal nature the same way we understand the concept of space having no beginning and end—by faith. We simply have to believe they are so, even though such thoughts put a strain on our distinctly insufficient cerebrums.|`|MeFeazFiaa	Human beings created the christian god, zeus, odin, allah and 4000 other gods.<br>  <br>  Believe in god and your money disappears down a black hole.

A young fellow just asked almost the same question a while ago: "If God created everything, then who created God?" This is the shortest I could answer and do justice to your question. I think you'll find that 90% of it is applicable. <br>  <br>  But think about it. When did time begin? What time was it an hour before that? And where does space end? And if it has an end, what is on the other side of that? They go on forever, infinitely, or at least so far that there's not much point in our pursuing the matter.<br>  <br>  So there are some things within our everyday experience that are infinite. Space may be curved, but then, if it went straight, where would it go, and how far? Mathematicians and quantum physicists deal with infinity every day. So saying that God is infinite shouldn't be that hard to comprehend, really. <br>  <br>  And if there is no God because there is no one to create him, then how did intelligent life come to be by itself? Many top scientists theorize and believe that it did by evolution...So the question is really just a circular question, that is, one that goes around in a circle without ever coming to a definite answer, one that substitutes US for God, because it says that it is possible that we, instead of God, came into being by ourselves.<br>  <br>  Problem is, in our universe there is something called entropy, which, among other things, means that complicated things tend to go downhill instead of uphill, if you know what I mean. They don't get better by themselves. and we and every other living thing are very complicated. That's why you have teachers, engineers, scientists, coaches, managers--to keep things from going downhill, to produce improvement. And even something as simple as a fly comes equipped with things that are hard to believe as happening by themselves--self-constructing, self-programming, self-correcting, navigational system that enables it to fly forward, backward, and upside down, self-fueling, SELF-REPRODUCING. We can't yet design ANYTHING like that. Whoever did deserves great respect.<br>  <br>  If there is a God, and many people believe the evidence goes that way, He would be on a completely different plane than we are, made of different stuff than we are and possibly existing amid different rules and forces than we are, and any attempt to explain what he is will be like a bacteria trying to explain to another bacteria what the scientist is like who is looking at them through the microscope. Completely different scale of time, size, speed, ability. And vastly different scales sometimes have vastly different rules and forces at work. Can't you just hear the bacteria? "She can't possibly travel that fast! He can't possibly be that big! She can't possibly be that smart! He can't possibly live that long!" Stephen Hawking, in his book, "The Universe in a Nutshell", noted how some of the atomic forces only become noticeable on extremely small scales, gravity only on extremely large scales. People long wondered how the gecko lizard could stick to and walk on the ceiling, without glue on his feet. Scientists discovered that there are forces and rules at work in the tiny fibers on his feet (microfibers) that they hadn't realized existed or were at work. And NOW we have Microfiber cloths, mops, etc. (But who figured out how to grow microfibers on the gecko's feet? And nowhere else?) <br>  <br>  The Bible says that God is made of different stuff (John 4:23,24) and exists in a different environment, allowing for different rules, principles and forces. Since in our generation alone we have discovered several forces not previously recognized, and an incredible number of principles and processes and phenomena, that, especially now, doesn't seem unreasonable.  If we're smart, it seems to me that we need to recognize the same possiblity of as-yet-undiscovered principles, rules, phenomena and forces with God.<br>  <br>  The more I think about it, saying that God has always been here is hard to understand, but no other choice for a beginning of the universe can be said to make any more sense. Starting from nothing doesn't make any sense to me. Where would anything come from? And why? And even the Big Bang assumes a starting point with all of the mass and energy of the universe crammed into it. But how long was THAT there? And where did it come from? And why? <br>  <br>  "God has always existed."  "Matter/energy have always existed."  See any similarities?  The problem of coming up with a definite beginning from an indefinite, infinite past remains whether you believe in God or not.<br>  <br>  So I have no problem believing in a Creator.  This is not, of course, defending the horrible things that have been done, like the Inquisition, or the unscientific things taught, like a 7,000-year-old universe, by fallible humans supposedly in God's name...<br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  Mike|`|oTehE3LIaa	There had to be something that always existed--the beginning of everything else.

His father saw him and warned, "Don’t touch that heater, son. It may look pretty, but it’s hot." The little boy believed him, and moved away from the heater. Some time later, after his father had left the room, the boy thought, "I wonder if it really is hot." He then reached out to touch it and see for himself. The second his flesh burned, he stopped believing it was hot; he now knew it was hot! He had moved out of the realm of belief into the realm of experience.<br>  <br>  Christians believed in God’s existence before their conversion. However, when they obeyed the Word of God, turned from their sins, and embraced Jesus Christ, they stopped merely believing. The moment they reached out and touched the heater bar of God’s mercy, they moved out of belief into the realm of experience. This experience is so radical, Jesus referred to it as being "born again." The Bible says that those who don’t know God are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1; 4:18). We are born with physical life, but not spiritual life. Picture unbelievers as corpses walking around who, by repenting and placing their faith in Christ, receive His very life. There is a radical difference between a corpse and a living, breathing human, just as there is when sinners pass from spiritual death to life. The apostle Paul said if you are "in Christ," you are a brand new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17).<br>  <br>  Those who now have God’s Spirit living in them will love what He loves and desire to do His will; they will have a hunger for His Word, a love for other believers, and a burden for the lost. The Holy Spirit also confirms in their spirit that they are now children of God (Romans 8:16). Those who believe on the name of the Son of God can know that they have eternal life (1 John 5:12,13).<br>  <br>  Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, "My speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God" (1 Corinthians 2:4,5). What Paul was saying was, "I deliberately didn’t talk you into your faith, but I let God’s power transform you." He didn’t reach them through an intellectual assent, but through the realm of personal experience.<br>  <br>  Suppose two people—a heater manufacturer and a skin specialist—walked into the room just after that child had burned his hand on the heater. Both assured the boy that he couldn’t possibly have been burned. But all the experts, theories, and arguments in the world will not dissuade that boy, because of his experience. Those who have been transformed by God’s power need never fear scientific or other arguments, because the man with an experience is not at the mercy of a man with an argument. "For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance . . ." (1 Thessalonians 1:5).

That's known as Pascal's wager. I don't consider these folks Christian or religious at all.

But, I do know that the Lord has told us to comfort the feeble minded. 1Thes. 5:14. Now, we exhort you, brethren, warn them that are unruly(lazy/idle), comfort the feeble minded, support the weak, be patient toward all men. As the Body of Christ we need to be there for one another and not be judgmental when one is not capable of understanding the Word. Look at the world and you will see that the ones who are weak are pushed away and forgotten. We must be there for them to lift them up to the Lord. Acts 20:35 Paul exhorted the ones in Ephesus to support the weak and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, that it is better to give than to receive.<br>  Remember Isaiah 61:1,2. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because He hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty them that are bruised, To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. <br>  God sees our hearts whether we are intelligent or not. He alone can discern the true nature in man. <br>  Remember too what Jesus said, "Verily I say unto you, Whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter therein." Mark 10:15. What does a little child do best but trust and obey.

It is like young children sitting in the marketplaces who cry out to their playmates, 17 saying, ‘We played the flute for YOU, but YOU did not dance; we wailed, but YOU did not beat yourselves in grief.’ 18 Correspondingly, John came neither eating nor drinking, yet people say, ‘He has a demon’; 19 the Son of man did come eating and drinking, still people say, ‘Look! A man gluttonous and given to drinking wine, a friend of tax collectors and sinners.’ All the same, wisdom is proved righteous by its works.” "<br>  <br>  "But we think it proper to hear from you what your thoughts are, for truly as regards this sect it is known to us that everywhere it is spoken against.” " (Acts of the Apostles ("Acts") 28:22)<br>  <br>  Russell devoted his life and personal fortune to the work of Bible education for the common person, and encouraging the common person to do the same!<br>  <br>  Of course, any organization of human beings is going to have constant problems to overcome, but the Witnesses overcome most of them by following Jesus' statement, "By this all will know that YOU are my disciples, if YOU have love among yourselves.” " (John 13:35)<br>  <br>  Please, by all means, check the Witnesses out to your heart's content.

OeAfpIZAaa	Corruption.|`|9VJV2Dcvaa	An expressive part of the money obtained from the selling of indulgences was used to build the Vatican!!!!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	Part of that great part of the most famous of Creeds -- now either cut out or re-interpreted by non-Catholics, the Communion of Saints :<br>  <br>  APOSTLES CREED<br>  I believe in the Holy Ghost;<br>      the holy catholic church;<br>     THE COMMUNION OF SAINTS;<br>      the forgiveness of sins;<br>      the resurrection of the body;<br>      and the life everlasting.<br>  <br>  So, the connection is : <br>  As God teaches us, the prayers and good works of one, when offered on behalf of another, atones for sins:My brethren, if any one among you wanders from the truth and some one brings him back, let him know thatwhoever brings back a sinner from the error of his way will save his soul from death and will cover a multitudefor sins (Jas. 5:19-20).This exchange of graces is one example of the communion of saints. “In this wonderful exchange, holiness ofone profits others, well beyond the harm that the sin of one could cause others (cf. Rom. 5:20). Thus recourse to thecommunion of saints lets the contrite sinner be more promptly and efficaciously purified of the punishments forsin.”10We . . . call these spiritual goods of the communion of saints the Church’s treasury, which is “not thesum total of the material goods which have accumulated during the course of the centuries. On thecontrary the ‘treasury of the Church’ is the infinite value, which can never be exhausted, whichChrist’s merits have before God.”11In exercising her authority to bind and loose, the Church uses indulgences as a means to lessen the temporalconsequences of sin and apply the effects of penance. As noted, one obtains an indulgence after having received forgiveness and performing the prescribed acts of penanc<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  =========================<br>  Here is what a convert to Catholicism and a great Bible scholar said on the subject :<br>  <br>  Indulgences, "to absolve from sin" sometimes means one of two things quite distinct from real absolution. First, it may mean nothing else but to remit the punishment of sin; and next, it may mean to absolve externally or to reconcile to the Church, in the sense in which I explained the phrase in a previous Lecture [Note 8]. Here, however, I am going to speak of the phrase in the former of these two senses—viz., as the remission of the punishment remaining after pardon of the sin. This is an indulgence; indulgence never is absolution or pardon itself. At the same time it is quite certain that, as far as words go, Indulgences have sometimes been drawn up in such a form as conveys to a Protestant reader the idea of real absolution, which they always presuppose and never convey. To a person who is not pardoned {347} (and pardoned he cannot be without repentance), an Indulgence does no good whatever; an indulgence supposes the person receiving it to be already absolved and in a state of grace, and then it remits to him the punishment which remains due to his past sins, whatever they are; but that this is really the meaning, a Protestant will as little gather from the form of words in which it has been sometimes drawn up, as he would gather from the good old soul's words cited just now, that "absolution" means "leave to go to communion." If Protestants will not take their information from Catholics on points such as this, but are determined to judge for themselves and to insist on the letter, there is no help for it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newmanreader.org/works/england/lecture8.html#indulgences" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmanreader.org/works/englan...</a>|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	<a href="http://www.catholic.com/library/Primer_on_Indulgences.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.catholic.com/library/Primer_o...</a>|`|AA11796124	INDULGENCE - "The remission before God of the temporal punishment due to sins forgiven as far as their guilt is concerned, which the follower of Christ with the proper dispositions and under certain determined conditions acquires through the intervention of the Church, which, as minister of the redemption, authoritatively dispenses and applies the treasury of the satisfaction won by Christ and the saints" (Pope Paul VI, Apostolic Constitution on Indulgences). <br>  <br>  As originally understood, an indulgence was a mitigation of the severe canonical penances imposed on the faithful for grave sins. The term "indulgence" remained, however, even after these extreme penalties were discontinued. Yet until the Second Vatican Council, the norm for determining the effectiveness of an indulgenced practice was its relationship to the ancient canonical penances, as seen in the numbers, so many years or so many days, attached to every official listing of partial indulgences. <br>  <br>  All this changed by Pope Paul VI. From now on the measure of how efficacious an indulgenced work is depends on two things: The supernatural charity with which the indulgenced task is done, and the perfection of the task itself. <br>  <br>  Another innovation is that partial and plenary indulgences can always be applied to the dead by way of suffrage, asking God to remit their sufferings if they are still in purgatory.|`|wxBFZ41Taa	Indulgences are still around.

Most people who study scripture are aware of it. Doesn't make a difference to the message. The bible wasn't dictated by God. <br>  There were 40 writers over 1500 years. Putting it all into a historical, geopolitical context and knowing the personality of each writer and their agenda takes some study. Then one has to identify the style - narrative or poetry - under that category there are 100 literary styles. <br>  I have about 50 books that help with that.

If I thought the Bible was only a bunch of myths and legends, then I wouldn't want to base my life on it, either. But that's not what it is—not at all.<br>  <br>  This is why I invite you to discover the Bible for yourself, and not simply go on what you've heard others say about it. You see, the Bible tells us about real events and real people—people who faced the same challenges we do, and had the same hopes and dreams we have. But many of them had another dimension to their lives also: a spiritual dimension. The reason wasn't just because they believed in God, but because they knew God in a personal way. We can, too.<br>  <br>  Most of all, the Bible tells us about Jesus Christ. It tells us who He was and what He did; most of all it tells us He was God in human flesh, sent from heaven to save us from sin and death and judgment. Do you honestly want to know what God is like? Look at Jesus Christ, for in Him "all the fullness of the Deity lives in bodily form" (Colossians 2:9). He proved it by doing something no one else has ever done: He rose from the dead.<br>  <br>  Don't let pride, or fear, or anything else keep you from the Bible, and from the One who is its center: Jesus Christ. When you honestly examine it, you'll discover the greatest truth anyone can ever know: God loves you, and He will change your life as you open your heart to Christ. <br>  <br>  David<br>  believer_in_jesus37421@yahoo.com|`|EBGdlo35aa	Certainly there is a chance.

Why, I should say, my brethren, that that man was worshipping his own mind, his own dear self and not God; that his idea of God was a mere accidental form which his thoughts took at this time or that,—for a long period or a short one, as the case might be,—not an image of the great Eternal Object, but a passing sentiment or imagination which meant nothing at all.

Veneration is often shown outwardly by respectfully bowing or making the sign of the cross before a saint's icon, relics, or statue.

This sovereign worship is due to God alone; addressed to a creature it would become idolatry. When worship is addressed only indirectly to God, that is, when its object is the veneration of martyrs, of angels, or of saints, it is a subordinate worship dependent on the first, and relative, in so far as it honours the creatures of God for their peculiar relations with Him; it is designated by theologians as the worship of dulia, a term denoting servitude, and implying, when used to signify our worship of distinguished servants of God, that their service to Him is their title to our veneration (cf. Chollet, loc. cit., col. 2407, and Bouquillon, Tractatus de virtute religionis, I, Bruges, 1880, 22 sq.). As the Blessed Virgin has a separate and absolutely supereminent rank among the saints, the worship paid to her is called hyperdulia (for the meaning and history of these terms see Suicer, Thesaurus ecclesiasticus, 1728).” <br>  I do not know why some are opposed to this definition as it clearly states that the worship is Christocentric but allow me to try to explain it further. <br>  <br>  Throughout history the Church has given special honor to the Blessed Mother. The definition is an attempt to differentiate the differences in the way the blessed mother is venerated and the other Saints with the adoration we as Catholics have for the incarnate Word of God, the Father and the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  Saints are revered with “dulia” which is human reverence and devotion given because of their intercession on behalf of us and is very similar to the reverence given to friends who pray for us in times of need.<br>  <br>  The mother of God receives hyperdulia which is also human reverence and devotion but with a deeper respect for her closeness to her son in intercession for our prayers. All prayer, whether it comes from a saint or from the blessed mother on our behalf, is totally and absolutely dependent on Christ. <br>  <br>  What one should try to understand is that Catholic devotion to the blessed mother does not take away from our adoration of Christ but instead gives our adoration a better focus. This is not like idol worship which changes one’s focus from the true God but through imitation of her devotion we are focused on Him. Every saint by their life spent in devotion and service to God gives us encouragement and their prayers for us give us greater hope that we also will endure to final salvation as their example exemplifies.<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|vhlORK4Waa	no need to be rude!!<br>  <br>  o Catholics worship the saints? To worship someone is to acknowledge that the one who is worshiped is divine, is God. Sometimes we can confuse cultural gestures of reverence for gestures of worship. In doing so, we often judge not as God does, by what is in the heart, but rather by appearances (see Jn 8:15, Is 11:3). <br>  <br>  Catholics hold saints in esteem because they are such wonderful images or mirrors of Christ. Paul several times exhorts his readers to be imitators of him: "Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ" (1 Cor 11:1, also Phil 3:17, 1 Cor 4:16). <br>  <br>  Mary is the first saint, and holds high honor today, as she did in the early Church. Over the course of history, devotion to Mary has taken many forms, and even has been confused with worship. Church teaching has consistently placed Mary in the company of the saints, however.<br>  <br>  Devotion to the saints comes back to the theology of image: Christ is God's image, the saints are Christ's image. We honor them because we desire to imitate them. We pray to them the same as we call upon earthly friends to do a favor for us. This too, is scriptural. In Acts we read of Peter and John going up to the Temple for prayer and encountering a beggar. Peter says to him, "I have neither silver nor gold, but what I do have I give you: in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazorean, rise and walk" (Acts 3:6). Peter makes it clear that he has the power of Christ in his possession. <br>  <br>  To be sure, it is Jesus who heals, but Peter holds the right to extend that power. The same can be said of Paul. In Acts 19:11-12 we read, "So extraordinary were the mighty deeds God accomplished at the hands of Paul that when face cloths or aprons that touched his skin were applied to the sick, their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them." These texts are the basis of the Catholic practice of asking saints to help us, of honoring (not worshiping) the bodies and relics of saints.<br>  <br>  Here is what the dictionary says regarding the words venerate and worship:<br>  <br>  Venerate: "To regard with respect, reverence, or heartfelt deference."<br>  <br>  One of the 10 Commandments is "Honor your Father and your Mother." Do you honor your father and mother? Do you respect them? These are the things Catholics do for their parents, and for the Blessed Virgin Mary.<br>  <br>  Worship: "The reverent love and devotion accorded a deity, an idol, or sacred object."<br>  <br>  Do you worship your parents? Certainly not, and neither do Catholics worship theirs. However, it is perfectly alright to venerate them and for Catholics to venerate the Blessed Virgin Mary.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps to clear up what appears to be a misunderstanding<br>  Halcon|`|vYFqEtcUaa	Catholic don't worship saints.

The Catholic Encyclopedia explains the difference: <br>  <br>  The worship of latria (latreia), or strict adoration, is given to God alone; the worship of dulia (douleia), or honour and humble reverence, is paid the saints; the worship of hyperdulia (hyperdouleia), a higher form of dulia, belongs, on account of her greater excellence, to the Blessed Virgin Mary. <><a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.htm>" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/02364b.h...</a><br>  Similarly, the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America explains: <br>  <br>  In the Orthodox Church the worship (latreia) given to God is completely different from the honor (tim) of love (agape) and respect, or even veneration (proskynesis) "paid to all those endowed with some dignity" (Chrysostom).<br>  <br>  Supporters also point out that the Bible encourages the veneration of angels, who are comparable to the saints in that they are creatures with a special relationship to God (references include Ex. 23:20; Jos. 5:13; Dan. 8:15 and 10:4; Matt. 18:10; Luke 2:9; Acts 12:7; and Rev. 5:11 and 7:1).

AA10456284	I just had to jump in and say, I am SO SICK of people using the lame" get a better job" excuse for THEIR poor behavior.You don't know why someone is working where they are...I actually LIKE my job, the people i work with, the hours...and oh, guess what? out of all my friends with "better" jobs...by which I am assuming you mean an "office" job...why that constitutes as "better" is beyond me...I am the ONLY one that doesn't need a roommate to get by. Cops and firemen don't get paid that well....do you want to tell THEM to get a better job? I think YOU should get a better attitude...if you can't tip, don't go out. Very simple. or go to a place that tipping isn't acceptable. In a restaurant/bar, we expect to get tipped bc we go above the norm...it's not fast food, we don't just hand it to you and walk off. It's a whole other level of service, and if you want to continue to enjoy it, then tip your server. Trust me, the tables that screw me over and then have the gall to come back, figure out very quickly the difference between tipped and nontipped service.|`|pfke6Jieaa	because that would be too "white".....lol. im not black but i always tip when required. i dont tip someone from mcdonalds though for example. cuz that ***** only takes my order and hands me the bag so he doesnt do that much work. my only tip to him would be to find a better job....jp.|`|DhffKJreaa	Uhmm generalization much!!<br>  <br>  I tip and I'm african.

But the dream has loop holes that tend to limit certain folk's ability to do so. The economic reality is that African Americans are still 3/5 persons when it comes to economics, earning on average only 60% of what the so-called mainstream "earns." That reality has its way of manifesting itself in various ways. Tipping is probably one of them. <br>  <br>  It seems to me that something is wrong with a custom that allows employers to offer knowingly inadequate wages with the expectation that patrons are going to make up the difference, without the understanding that some patrons can't! On top of that, it is pretty well documented that African Americans in general get the worst service in everything American and, therefore, may feel no desire to tip.<br>  <br>  If you understand and appreciate this, then you should either chill on this issue or limit yourself to working where "codes" and "charges" assure a certain economic clientele. Peace.

And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and cast it from you; for it is more profitable for you that one of your members perish, than for your whole body to be cast into hell." (Matthew 5:27-30)<br>  <br>  Please don't harm your eyes!!  The passage demonstrates the importance of putting aside what makes you sin. Also think that Jesus did not sacrifice himself on the cross and endure all the sufferings for us to sin again and again. I think people should try to show in their behaviour that his sacrifice was worth it and that we are worthy of it through our actions by doing what is good.|`|86d89523a598db2e1df40b31020c6fc1aa	Give it up for Lent, it is never to late to give p for Lent even if it already started.

vhlORK4Waa	The Greek Matthias (or, in some manuscripts, Maththias), is a name derived from Mattathias, Hebrew Mattithiah, signifying "gift of Yahweh." Matthias was one of the seventy disciples of Jesus, and had been with Him from His baptism by John to the Ascension (Acts 1:21-22). It is related (Acts 1:15-26) that in the days following the Ascension, Peter proposed to the assembled brethren, who numbered one hundred and twenty, that they choose one to fill the place of the traitor Judas in the Apostolate. Two disciples, Joseph, called Barsabas, and Matthias were selected, and lots were drawn, with the result in favour of Matthias, who thus became associated with the eleven Apostles. Zeller has declared this narrative unhistoric, on the plea that the Apostles were in Galilee after the death of Jesus. As a matter of fact they did return to Galilee, but the Acts of the Apostles clearly state that about the feast of Pentecost they went back to Jerusalem. <br>  <br>  All further information concerning the life and death of Matthias is vague and contradictory. According to Nicephorus (Church History II.40), he first preached the Gospel in Judea, then in Ethiopia (that is to say, Colchis) and was crucified. The Synopsis of Dorotheus contains this tradition: Matthias preached the Gospel to barbarians and cannibals in the interior of Ethiopia, at the harbour of the sea of Hyssus, at the mouth of the river Phasis. He died at Sebastopolis, and was buried there, near the Temple of the Sun<br>  <br>  Still another tradition maintains that Matthias was stoned at Jerusalem by the Jews, and then beheaded It is said that St. Helena brought the relics of St. Matthias to Rome, and that a portion of them was at Trier. Bollandus* (Acta SS., May, III) doubts if the relics that are in Rome are not rather those of the St. Matthias who was Bishop of Jerusalem about the year 120, and whose history would seem to have been confounded with that of the Apostle. <br>  <br>  The Latin Church celebrates the feast of St. Matthias on 14 May and the Greek Church on 9 August.<br>  <br>  Apocryphal writings relate that Matthias went among the cannibals and, being cast into prison, was delivered by Andrew. Needless to say, the entire narrative is without historical value. Moreover, it should be remembered that, in the apocryphal writings, Matthew and Matthias have sometimes been confounded. <br>  <br>  Halcon|`|DEzHhQeFaa	<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Matthias" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saint_Matth...</a>|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	<a href="http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10066a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10066a.h...</a>|`|b3f4f6798be929d658ec38c5b998d657aa	He was chosen to replace Judas Iscariot, he led a simply ministry and was martyred for his teachings as a Disciple of Christ.

Religions should always strive to keep their religion out of politics.  <br>  <br>  However, when a religion like Christianity has Jesus, presumably (which is to say it may not be true because saying this would cause conflict and war, which it has) tells his followers to teach other nations and baptize them in the name of the Father, and you have religious zealots that get into office, like the Talmudic Jews and their belief that they are "the chosen" who have to build the Kingdom of God on Earth, then you get endless conflict leading to war.|`|TzY9vkinaa	I think everyone should be in politics including Christians.

84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	Wowww.... Rape is bad because not everyone wants to have sex with just anyone. Maybe YOU do but most people don't. I sure as hell don't want to be raped by some 40 yr old man. I'm 20. <br>  <br>  And men can be raped too. How would you like it if some woman you were not attracted to tried to rape you?<br>  <br>  I hate double standards.|`|1yJWrccXaa	True rape is a terrible act of violence and a crime to go to prison for.  True rape can have many devastating consequences.  The way you are using the word though it sounds like you have a sexual fantasy of power.  Most people have some sort of fantasy to control or be controled but it shouldn't be acted out unless it is with a consenting partner as a wild sex game.  Many women have shared with me that they have had such sexual fantasies.  No woman has ever told me that she wants to be brutally forced and hurt and humiliated.|`|PPyMhRJAaa	I agree with Jenna and Tupper.

This is from a man who thinks women have no say  -  and should have no say  -   in the matter of who has intercourse with them.<br>  Only men who can't talk or charm or attract a women into bed will feel the need to rape. So, by definition, a rapist is a man whom women really REALLY do not want to go to bed with. Why should any woman be forced to have the unwanted part of an unwanted man forced violently into her body ?  And why should you take this vile crime so lightly ?<br>  Add to this that rapes take place out of doors in places like parks, beaches, footpaths, roadsides, and other horribly uncomfortable or even dangerous places , this makes your attitude even more sick. Also, many rapists turn to drugs to subdue a woman who would otherwise refuse sex.  You cannot by the wildest stretch of your perverted imagination think that a woman would enjoy that.  <br>  Add to the fact that most men anyway just do not know how to give a woman real enjoyment during sex, all you are suggesting is that women should be regarded and treated as men's playthings, and that they should put up with it so that men can have lots more fun than ever before, and never have to pay the price  - that is, being arrested, charged, standing trial and going to jail.<br>  Male Chauvinist pigs are supposed to be out of fashion, but you seem to be attempting a one-man revival of this disgusting and deeply unattractive behaviour<br>  If you are so deeply unattractive, no wonder you feel the need to rape women  - clearly they don't fancy you enough to be willing partners.|`|CEKAqtB1aa	Its not free its forced which is different you complete idiot, cannot believe someone like you exists.|`|VG2X9Ihkaa	Rape means when one have sex with the other person without their consent.

Pervert.|`|sRvfF732aa	That's the thing- a woman doesn't feel "sexual pleasure" when forced into the act in a threatening manner, by someone they aren't attracted to or possibly don't even know.

Then, if you start to avoid him and he comes to you wanting to be a part of your life, give him a chance.

God is inviting us to become His sons and daughters.  You have the free will to chose to accept or reject His invitation.  If you want to be perceived by others as a moral, ethical and loving person who wants to be apart from God, then He will honor that request.  <br>  <br>  Heaven is not the reward.

Then suppose he gave you a prescription that would cure your illness—but you refused to take it. Who would be to blame if you failed to get better—the doctor, or you? I think you know the answer.<br>  <br>  In the same way, the whole human race has a very serious spiritual "illness." It is a disease of our souls that the Bible calls sin. It is so serious, in fact, that it has put us on the road to eternal separation from God—which is what the Bible calls hell.<br>  <br>  But listen: God loves us—and because He loves us, He has provided the remedy for our spiritual disease. The remedy is Jesus Christ, who took the punishment we deserve when He died on the cross for us. This is why the Bible says, "For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord" (Romans 6:23). Yes—salvation is a free gift!<br>  <br>  But what if we refuse it? What if we fail to accept the remedy God has provided? Who, then, is to blame if we continue on the road away from God? The answer is clear: We are. In other words, God doesn't send us to hell; we send ourselves. Don't gamble with your soul, but by faith accept Christ so you can know—beyond doubt—that you will go to be with Him in heaven forever.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	We're all sinners.

That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation. <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what!<br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead.

We know it because we are all separated from each other.<br>  At the moment humanity is the farthest it can be from Godliness, which is the quality of unconditional bestowal and love.<br>  In this condition we have no chance of sensing anything spiritual.<br>  First of all we have to change our attitudes and connections towards each other.<br>  If we can build a new human society based on the above mentioned Godly qualities, we will start sensing the higher force within our connections.<br>  Until then it is purely faith and philosophy.<br>  But it is in our hands, we can all achieve it here and now, while still living our present life on earth.<br>  The Bible verse I would recommend: "Love your neighbor as yourself".<br>  I hope it helps, all the best.|`|aCDWwsisaa	Rejoice that they have come to their senses, (so few do!), and try to follow their example.

Tell them that Jesus will kill all their children if they end up in the wrong church!<br>  <br>  According to the Bible writers, ONE SUREST SIGN of Jesus coming back and the Rapture? is the slaughter of innocent children in the end of days! The Bible writers made it into a clear pattern that before any major event in Bible stories innocent children get slaughtered right and left! This is a primitive trick to scare the heck out of religious people into catching their attention! They wrote that before Israel was liberated from Egypt (there is not a trace of historical evidence outside of the Bible that the Jews were ever slaves in Egypt, but what the heck!) God had ALL the innocent first born children of Egyptian parents slaughtered on the spot without any mercy! When Jesus was born in Judea ALL the innocent male children 2 years of age and under got slaughtered in a way that not even God the Holy Ghost was able to comfort the grieving mothers! It was a massacre of humongous proportions unlike Hitler’s holocausting the Jews! (Mat 2:18) When Jesus comes back he will personally slaughter ALL the CHILDREN of the wrong Church brand! He will have them slaughtered not in Babylon, but in the Churches! Christians are brainwashed believing that Jesus doesn’t do that! As far as sadistic religions go not even Islam matches Christianity! It is all in the Bible! Now Christianity survives picking on new religious “sins” like abortion, equal sex marriages, stem cell research, etc. Even the new President Obama honors most Christian and Catholic clergy dogmas damning gays, equal sex marriage and so on!<br>  <br>  Revelation 2:23 (NIV) (Jesus says in his apocalyptic REVELATION NOW for the last days) “I WILL STRIKE HER CHILDREN DEAD”* (*Abortionists deal only with the fetus when necessary so they can’t beat Jesus at killing babies! Jesus is doing the killing of the innocent children on his own to announce his expected return and at the same time to teach everybody a lesson on WHO IS THE BOSS! In our society today Christians are very selective in what they want to believe from the Bible! Their political “PRO-LIFE” stand is only an attempt to disassociate from this kind of Jesus’ REVELATION…!) Then ALL THE CHURCHES WILL KNOW* (*Bully Mafia talk!) that I am he who searches hearts and minds, and I will repay each of you according to your deeds.<br>  <br>  I’m the BOSS says Jesus Christ the LORD and I take it on the kids in the Churches! This make believe Bible Jesus is promoting the killing of children of the wrong Christian brand to set an EXAMPLE! All Christians claim to be of the right faith! Most of them will be up for a big surprise when they find out that their children have been mysteriously slaughtered! Jesus infanticide mania comes from way back when the Jewish Bible writers had God the Father highly favoring anyone killing the innocent children of his enemies! <br>  <br>  Psalm 137:8-9 (NIV) O Daughter of Babylon, doomed to destruction, happy is he who repays you for what you have done to us --he who seizes your infants and dashes them against the rocks.<br>  <br>  That is why Jesus Christ knows that the enemies of TRUE Christianity (whatever that is) ought to be killed in their infancy when it is easier to get rid of them! In Bible times hardly anybody practiced abortions because it was easier and much safer to “dash the infants against the rocks” after they are born than having them aborted. Unwanted children were put out without any accountability to anybody right after they were born like it was done in Egypt to the willing Hebrew ladies. Christianity is not much of a civilized religion at all! <br>  <br>  Luke 19:27 (NIV) (Jesus is very excited telling this story… most Christians prefer to ignore, although the Clergy and the Westboro class Christians love it!) But those enemies of mine who did not want me to be king over them–bring them here and kill them in front of me.<br>  <br>  I'm telling you what the HOLY BIBLE writers say! ESPECIALLY IN THE NEW TESTAMENT that is strongly believed in Christianity today!!!<br>  <br>  The Bible writers made Christianity into a very violent religion. “Turning the other cheek” is a joke! They have Jesus suggesting the slaughter by drowning of anybody causing a Christian who is a moron in the Faith to stumble (Mat 18:6)… The shedding of body parts to make it into the Fairy Kingdom of Heaven! (Mat 5:29-30), INCLUDING male castration (Mat 19:12). The carving out of the female clitoris today is still widely done by the local butchers and practiced almost exclusively in Islam! Christian ladies in America are very lucky! BTW virginity and male castration is forbidden in God’s Law “Be fruitful and multiply,” but what the heck! Nunnery stuff is a Heathen sourced idea of the Early Church Fathers. Most Christians today don’t pay attention to Jesus’ gory suggestions, but throughout history many Christians got castrated for the “Kingdom Sake.” See Wikipedia “castration”. Christians are very gullible and willing to do anything that their preachers tell them. Christianity survives today only because it is disregarding most of the primitive and uncivilized pronouncements of the Early Church Fathers. Now the Clergy promote the be good, get well, get rich quick, pay your tithes and offerings on time and when you die you go to Heaven to be with Jesus! In fact, Christians are promised that at the moment that they will see Jesus they will be transformed to be like HIM!!! Like this children killing JESUS! Please give me a break!

God does not ask for human sacrifice. <br>  <br>  Jesus Christ is God and he came to earth to pay for our sins, because we can never be saved on our own.

AA10170845	Not too long ago I was given a very nice complement.  A man I was working with in a political battle that had gotten pretty ugly said to me that he really admired the way I got over things so quickly and was ready to be friends with former foes.  I have to admit that I can be pretty gruff and to the point.  I tend to say what I think, but he was right that after the battle is over I'm ready to forget it and move on.  He then went on to point out that others may take longer to heal.  I think it was his kind way of telling me I shouldn't be so blunt.  I appreciated the complement and tried to accept the advice also.|`|Y6odIQgJaa	I can and do forgive.<br>  <br>  But I never forget....|`|rTplTuEdaa	Yes  i  do ,,I love everyone and can ot be mad long.|`|J4z3mJyuaa	Yes. I believe everyone does. Some people just have a harder time swallowing their pride and accepting others' mistakes. (For example: Feeling that someone does not deserve your forgiveness and/or has not earned it.)<br>  People need to realize that it will make them much happier in life to forgive than to hold onto their anger. We all make mistakes. I pity those who have a lot of hate in their heart. Hate will destroy your view of the world and everyone in it. It will cause negative feelings and mistrust, which will prevent you from holding close bonds with people, etc. It goes on to affect everything in your life.<br>  Just let it go...It is ignorant to intentionally harm your own quality of life. Chances are that person you hate won't even care. You are only harming yourself and those you love. Forgive, but do not forget.<br>  <br>  "stephanie" - Count your blessings! It is a gift to be forgiving when others struggle with it. You aren't a "sucker". The people that waste time and happiness in their life holding a grudge against someone are the "suckers".<br>  <br>  "T" - I will cut ties with someone for doing things that may be harmful to me or those around me, but that doesn't mean I don't forgive them. I just accept their flaws/mistakes and move on. I don't think forgiveness should mean that you have to put your happiness in harm's way.|`|YOt6uTSzaa	I'm not sure, my friends or friend are very limited and are not around at the moment...<br>  <br>  My closest friend my husband says...hmmmm, he said I am still very selective, but have come a long way from where I used to be.... he is right, it is true, now my memory has been thoroughly refreshed.<br>  So much better to ask and talk to someone else, especially when they know you inside and out and have gone through life with you.

Forgiveness is too often misunderstood or misinterpreted. Too many people confuse the words forgive and condone. Forgiveness is not something you receive in return for atonement. Rather, forgiveness releases the victim from his or her personal prison through release of anger toward and hatred of the sinner/perpetrator. <br>  <br>  Sin is just a silly concept meant to trap people into an endless guilt-redemption cycle. <br>  <br>  If you wronged someone, by all means feel free to apologize or not. However, when they forgive you, it has nothing to do with you and is all about removing the thorn stuck in their heart. You will have to forgive yourself for any misdeeds you committed.|`|5163421430fada657d83a91148b438e2aa	Yes|`|8b35140fd5eabcceff1f6c71562a2a02aa	Yes, but ONLY by the grace of God x x|`|6lJuKKMHaa	It depends.

We simply view it as history. When the bible is viewed this way, we ignore the cultural, philosophical and spiritual ideas it contains. Looking at genesis as history prevents us from seeing the truth in its imagery and instead of seeing the nature of our humanity reflected back at us, we see the world created in 6 days, and tree with forbidden fruit.|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	Quite the opposite.

nQvcqVkNaa	You have struck upon a very interesting point. I was speaking to someone just yesterday about this and showing her some of the things the Bible says. She told me that she had never heard those things before. She also told me that she has a strong faith. I asked her if she believes that the entire Bible is a message from the Almighty Creator to us and she said yes. So I asked her 'if the Bible is God's message to us but you do not know it, can you truly say that you know God? She wants to start studying the Bible now!<br>  <br>  If one claims to have faith and yet does not study God's Word the Bible in order to get to know what God likes and dislikes, what exactly are they putting faith in?<br>  Perhaps they are putting too much faith in their favorite religious leader. What does God say about your favorite religious leader who does not encourage you to study God's message?<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:5; In the last days men will be having a form of godliness but denying its power. Have nothing to do with them.<br>  <br>  Matthew 7:21-23; "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only he who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles?' 23Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 4:3; For the time will come when men will not put up with sound doctrine. Instead, to suit their own desires, they will gather around them a great number of teachers to say what their itching ears want to hear.<br>  <br>  God does not want you to follow traditions, especially pagan rooted ones!

When they find, they will be disturbed. When they are disturbed, they will marvel, and will reign over all. [And after they have reigned they will rest.]" <br>  <br>  That quote comes from the Gospel of Thomas which was nearly chosen as number five.<br>  the full Gospel is in the Link along with a few others that some claim are closer to Christs message than the NT, millions have died because of those Gospels, they're worth reading just to see why?|`|3ba0ab7304ca31210254987d14dbe035aa	The only reason I can think of for people not to believe the bible is if it's inconsistent with their own personal agenda.  Instead of asking God to straighten them out with regarding to His word (i.e., changing their heart to line up with what He says is right and wrong), these people desire to change what God has said according to their own opinion.<br>  <br>  Many so-called "Christian" churches are being swayed by the culture of the day and abandoning the word of God.  It's a sad thing, but not unexpected, as the bible teaches in the last days there will be a "falling away" from the true faith.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	The traditions of men have invalidated the Word of God.That's why I left the Catholic Church.

Or Sophia, Wisdom, the Holy Spirit?<br>  <br>  The word for spirit in Hebrew was “Ruah” this was a feminine word, when it was translated into Greek it was translated as “Pneuma’ which neutered it.<br>  <br>  (Nag Hammdi Library, the lost gospels) In the Gospel of the Hebrews that the Nazarenes read, Yeshua says, "Even so did my mother, the Holy Spirit, take me by one of my hairs and carry me away to the great mountain Tabor [in Galilee]." It also says, "Just now my mother, the Holy Spirit, took me."  Yeshua refers to the Holy Spirit as his mother. The Acts of Thomas gives a graphic account of the Apostle Thomas when he went into India with Abbanes the merchant and contains within it prayers invoking the Holy Spirit as "the Mother of all creation," “She that revealeth the hidden mysteries,” "compassionate mother," “mother of the seven houses,” along with many other titles. These Coptic Christian writings unquestionably link the "spirit of Spirit" as the "Spirit of the Divine Mother." “We glorify and praise thee and thine invisible Father and thine holy spirit the mother of all creation.” (Acts of Thomas 39)<br>  <br>  King Solomon worshipped her: “She brought them over the Red Sea, and led them through deep waters; but she drowned their enemies, and cast them up from the depth of the sea.” (The Wisdom of Solomon 10:17-19) Notice it says “She.” In early Judaism the female aspect of god was called Shekinah.<br>  <br>  Jesus even said he was the true vine and his father was the husbandman. Husbands generally have a wife. It wasn’t until man decided to hide the consort under the neutered term Holy Spirit has she disappeared, but if you search hard enough you can find her.|`|3K51tgQWaa	If he did, she'd just be a beard.|`|wT9PTRgtaa	Yes,we (all those who believe in him) are his wife in the making.|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	Why would she want a wife?

God loves us no matter who we are or what we have done. Regardless of what may have happened to you to make you think otherwise, God cares about us more than we can imagine.The Bible tells us that ‘…God so loved the world that he gave his only Son …’. John 3:16 (NLT) When Jesus died on the cross, it was for you and he would have died for you if you were the only person in the world. If you have not seen the movie ‘The Passion of The Christ’ then I recommend that you do. While you watch it, try to remember that it was all about God’s love for you. Every lash of the whip, every punch and every moment of pain was taken on your behalf. Ignoring everything else that Jesus has ever done for you, he has still done more for you than anyone else ever could when he died on your behalf. Sure someone else could die for you but there is more to Jesus’ death than the physical side. When he died he suffered spiritually, that spiritual suffering was so severe that Jesus was taking the punishment for every bad thing that has ever been done by anyone for all time, (past, present or future!) God shows his love to us in many ways. We tend to take a lot of things for granted. The air we breathe, the clothes we wear and the food we eat. God provides all those things because of his love for us. Every good thing you own and have ever owned was a gift from God. Each day that we live is a gift from God. God’s desire is for you to be with him in an wonderful place called heaven where he wants to bless you for all eternity.God loves you with an everlasting love’. So I came to accept that God loves me in a way that goes beyond mere words. God did not do that just for my benefit alone, he loves you as well and he want’s you to know it. God loves you just as much as he loves me. The Bible tells us that ‘God has no favourites’.Romans 5:8 says ‘But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.’ (NLT) God does not wait until we are perfect before he decides to love us.|`|e50c8aae94677952ee9beadc76ab4c1baa	Yes I do love God, but am afraid whether it is as much as He can love His children.

For this reason, English translations of Orthodox texts will sometimes list him as "Gregory Dialogus". He was the first of the popes to come from a monastic background. Gregory is a Doctor of the Church and one of the six Latin Fathers. Immediately after his death, Gregory was canonized by popular acclaim. John Calvin admired Gregory and declared in his Institutes, that Gregory was the last good pope.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	What fact is described?  What mystery is revealed?  That a couple she-bears will maul a group of children may well be a fact, but that the she-bears were directed by a deity at the behest of a prophet made to feels ashamed of his baldness is hardly "fact" described nor "mystery" revealed in any sense of the terms.|`|5OucqEzFaa	I don't know anything about Pope Gregory apart from the information supplied by Galactic Emperor. However, when I read the quotation my thought processes went like this: Holy Writ = the Bible = the Word of God = Logos = Christ Jesus. From there I thought of 1 John 1 - 'In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God.'<br>  <br>  Looking at what Gregory said, I then leaped to the marvellous conclusion that the Trinity, or the triune nature of the Godhead, as described in 1 John 1, is a wonderful example of how the Word of God transcends every science because while it describes a fact, it reveals a mystery. We are introduced to the concept of the triune nature of the Godhead in Genesis chapter 1 but it isn't till after Jesus' resurrection that the revelation of who he was (and is) became clear.<br>  <br>  This may be a highly unpopular view given we live in a post-modern society that declares there is no such thing as God and Science supersedes religious explanations. Reality as perceived by Christians is mocked and ridiculed because the centre of most people's universe is no longer God but themselves.<br>  <br>  Anyway, for what it's worth, I go along with Pope Gregory and it seems to me that the Trinity is a perfect illustration of the point he was making about God's Word transcending every science because, whilst describing a fact, it also reveals a mystery.|`|aGRJ6MPdaa	Translation: "The Bible, since it lacks the structure of modern- day languages, in one verse is easily interpreted in more than one way, and when you think you have it interpreted correctly, it presents a problem with the rest of the text in the Bible." <br>  <br>  Then you have to keep re- interpreting the other verses to try to make them all match up, all the while being drawn by the temptation to follow the crowd and their interpretations!<br>  <br>  Fun!

aac509d23ce8da767d68e4f377f3f4c7aa	Real life is what Jesus Christ gives to those who come to him. The world offers depersonalisation, isolation, selfishness, materialism, triviality, with all of that on a tread-mill.<br>  <br>  People who reach out for the world's allurements and the world's accolades or rewards soon find them unfulfilling and try to grasp something else.

Poorly educated people can be just as lonely as well educated people!<br>  <br>  The Christian concept of the Trinity demonstrates what sublime reality is to be had in perfect unison between the three persons of Father, Son and Holy Spirit, all three passing on the love to the others, never grasping it, trying to retain any of it. If we learned from that, we could find true fulfillment, even in our imperfect lives. But the world keeps trying to break fellowship down, compartmentalising us all, with TV and electronic means the most sinister forms of detaching us from reality. People are real. God is real.

It is my opinion that life is too short to waste it on observing the antics of people who seem to have a highly inflated opinion of themselves. On the other hand, risk-takers have been around for millennia and I suspect climbing up a sheer rock face without any ropes will always appeal to a certain type of person, albeit very few. Perhaps you're referring to the thrill-seeking element that has become popular - like bungee jumping or white water rafting? I'd be very worried if watching 'Reality TV' was an outlet for feeling really alive, though.<br>  <br>  The reality of my parent's generation was working long, hard hours, often in manual labour, just to make ends meet. Perhaps they weren't as materialistic as this generation (whose expectations are higher), but on the other hand, mothers usually stayed at home to bring up the children and weekends included a day of rest (unlike now). Religious belief and regular church attendance was also higher. 'Reality TV' and extreme sports were not available then.<br>  <br>  One person's definition of living a full and meaningful life may include striving for material possessions, watching 'Reality TV' and engaging in thrill-seeking activities. Another person may describe that type of lifestyle as superficial. Perhaps the difficulty lies in people failing to think about the possibility that lives that are purely materialistic, physical and centred on self lack substance and lasting achievement.<br>  <br>  I'm inclined to go along with your suggestion that lives that are purely materialistic and physical reduce reality and fragment it, resulting in superficiality. It may well be the case that the younger generation is content to watch 'Reality TV' and/or engage in activities that make them feel 'really alive', but I can hardly inflict my opinion on people who do not share my values, experiences and hopes. Perhaps you need to ask, what is reality, or what constitutes a really meaningful life?|`|IIhiSprlaa	No, not even close.<br>  I don't even watch TV|`|jard50Yiaa	Reality television is a genre of television programming which presents purportedly unscripted dramatic or humorous situations, documents actual events, and usually features ordinary people instead of professional actors. Although the genre has existed in some form or another since the early years of television, the term reality television is most commonly used to describe programs of this genre produced since 2000. Documentaries and nonfictional programming such as news and sports shows are usually not classified as reality shows.<br>  <br>  Reality television covers a wide range of programming formats, from game or quiz shows which resemble the frantic, often demeaning shows produced in Japan in the 1980s and 1990s (such as Gaki no tsukai), to surveillance- or voyeurism-focused productions such as Big Brother.<br>  <br>  Such shows frequently portray a modified and highly influenced form of reality, with participants put in exotic locations or abnormal situations, sometimes coached to act in certain ways by off-screen handlers, and with events on screen sometimes manipulated through editing and other post-production techniques.
5pEgUh55aa	There is a post-modern philosophy that claims reality is a subjective experience - if it's real for you then it's real, but not necessarily real for someone else. It also claims that if something is true for you, then it's true, but not necessarily true for someone else.<br>  <br>  This post-modern philosophy would have us believe that God is not real and God is not true. But if God is a reality, then no amount of wishful thinking to the contrary will alter the fact of that reality. To claim that something (or someone) does not exist merely because one does not think they exist is self-delusion on the grandest (and most foolish) scale. Makes me think of the story about the King who was hoodwinked into thinking he was wearing the finest of clothes only he was stark naked. It took the honesty and perception of a small boy in the crowd to point out the blindingly obvious. <br>  <br>  You may have a point - a lot of people seem to jump onto whatever bandwagon of philosophy is flavour of the decade.|`|Vc1CT2e8aa	you know what is reality? world poverty, famine, dying children, war, rape, abuse, domestic violence, abandonement, murders, george w bush(the walking accident), depression, infidelity, i could go on....<br>  <br>  if you need to believe in a fake reality, where you think that divine intervention will protect from the world.  where if you don't believbe in this "God" then you'll never experience reality,  you dont live in reality, if god exists, condemn him, hes  done too much **** to the world, and the bible bashers like you, you parade thier christianity around webpages and such, accept this, you want reality, go outside and see it.|`|5tgksDp1aa	Assuming everything you said is correct, how do you know what "He says about realities"?

There's no way to know which holy book, if any, is actually God's word, so there is no way to know what "He says about realities".|`|VHa5PIfpaa	In the case of Existensialism, it could be said that they don't believe in God because their view of reality has been skewed.  In the case of true atheism, it is more likely the case that all evidence pointing to God's existance has either been disregarded or not been brought to light at all, and all the evidence supporting the existance of no God has been accepted as pointing to reality.<br>  <br>  Most of the answerers above me have proven my point.|`|1OHmbYFUaa	Even if there was a God (which is highly unlikely) who are you to say that your God is right, and the other religions, expecially the ones that came way before Christianity, are wrong?<br>  <br>  Can it with the 'hollier than thou' act.|`|6Ao8Bskfaa	Apart from being a complete moron, your "reality" is based on a single fictional book.

And the reason I say this. You are a girl. Girls never tell everything. <br>  Maybe he was going to tell you about it on his time. Or better yet, maybe he likes you so much that he overcame his gay sin. For you to be a Christian, you sure do judge and condemn people fast. <br>  If you are on here asking questions dealing with him anyway. You are not a honest person because you are airing your business to the world. You need to grow up and talk to the guy instead of judging and condeming him. <br>  How would you like it if someone pointed out the fact that you had your vagina wrapped around his cock. Either way you put it, that is still part of fornication. I'm sure this is something you don't want people, judging and condeming you on, so don't act like now you are innocent because you aren't. <br>  In all fairness, I hope he dumps you when he finds out what you did on line.

Not part of a Trinity.<br>  <br>  The Bible never speaks of the holy spirit in the same way that it speaks of God or of Jesus.<br>  <br>  In the Hebrew Scriptures, or the “Old Testament,” there are references to the “holy spirit” and to “my [God’s] spirit.” (Psalm 51:11; Joel 2:28,?29) We read that the holy spirit can fill a person, come upon him, and envelop him. (Exodus 31:3; Judges 3:10; 6:34) Some of God’s holy spirit can be taken from one person and given to another. (Numbers 11:17,?25) The holy spirit can become operative upon someone, enabling him to perform superhuman feats.—Judges 14:6; 1?Samuel 10:6.<br>  <br>  How can a portion of a person be taken from one individual and be given to another? Moreover, there is no evidence that when Jesus was on earth, faithful Jews viewed the holy spirit as a person equal to the Father. They certainly did not worship the holy spirit. Rather, their worship was directed solely to Jehovah, the One whom Jesus himself called “my Father” and “my God.”—John 20:17.<br>  <br>  Like the so-called Old Testament, the part of the Bible called the Christian Greek Scriptures, or “New Testament,” says that the holy spirit can ‘fill’ a person or be “upon” him. (Acts 2:4; Luke 2:25-27) Holy spirit was ‘given,’ ‘poured out upon,’ and ‘distributed.’ (Luke 11:13; Acts 10:45; Hebrews 2:4) At Pentecost 33?C.E., the disciples received “some of” God’s spirit. (Acts 2:17) The Scriptures also speak of baptism with holy spirit and of anointing with it.—Matthew 3:11; Acts 1:5; 10:38.|`|ni6SCUm9aa	A very strong Ale.|`|8PjHFUdfaa	"Breath" and "Spirit" in Hebrew is "Ruach."<br>  <br>  "Ruach" is a feminine noun.<br>  <br>  Often in Scripture the dove represents the Holy Spirit.

When it speaks about the dove coming down and landing on YAHUSHUA, in the Greek "dove" is also a feminine noun.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	I've always had problems with that concept, too. I had one friend say it was a separate thing from her god and that it could "fill you", so I started thinking of it like I think of demonic possession, just all christiany and stuff. Then a different friend said, "no, no, no. it's not an entity at all, it's god's active force!"<br>  <br>  I'm under the impression that you're not alone in not knowing. It would seem even christians can't all agree on what exactly it/he/she/they/whatever  could be.

The Holy Spirit is God Himself as He works today in the world and in the hearts of God's people. In other words, the Holy Spirit is God's presence with us today. At one time God came to us as a man: Jesus Christ, who was God in human flesh. But now God comes to us through His Spirit, Who—although He is unseen—is just as real as Jesus was to the first disciples. Jesus promised them, "If I go, I will send him to you" (John 16:7). That promise was fulfilled on Pentecost.<br>  <br>  Never forget: The Holy Spirit is God Himself. (This, incidentally, is why we should always refer to the Holy Spirit as "He" and not as an impersonal "it.") As such, He is all-powerful and all-knowing, and He loves us with an everlasting love. He also convicts us of sin and shows us the truth about Christ; He helps us when we pray and works within us to change our lives.<br>  <br>  Does God's Spirit dwell in you? The Bible warns, "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he does not belong to Christ" (Romans 8:9). Make sure of your commitment to Christ—and then thank God for the gift of the Holy Spirit, who now lives within you and will help you as you submit your life to Him.|`|fb6z7rVSaa	I agree with MoMiLKP3z!<br>  Rock on!!!|`|MNUAMFrkaa	I agree with "MoMiLKP3z" you are excluding a whole group of people based off religion.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors.

For many of us, this is a difficult concept to grasp. The Bible declares that there is only one living God, yet we learn from scripture that He comprises three separate personages. One way to partially visualize this concept is to examine the nature of water (H2O). Water is a single compound that can exist in three states – liquid, ice and vapor. An egg is another picture. It is comprised of the white, the yoke and the shell, yet it is still one egg. Of course, by no means do these examples paint a complete picture of our God, but they are illustrative of the fact that His three “persons” in no way invalidate His oneness.

In the year 326 the mother of Constantine, Helena, then about 80 years old, having journeyed to Jerusalem, undertook to rid the Holy Sepulchre of the mound of earth heaped upon and around it, and to destroy the pagan buildings that profaned its site, Some revelations which she had received gave her confidence that she would discover the Saviour's Tomb and His Cross. The work was carried on diligently, with the co-operation of St. Macarius, bishop of the city. The Jews had hidden the Cross in a ditch or well, and covered it over with stones, so that the faithful might not come and venerate it. Only a chosen few among the Jews knew the exact spot where it had been hidden, and one of them, named Judas, touched by Divine inspiration, pointed it out to the excavators, for which act he was highly praised by St. Helena. Judas afterwards became a Christian saint, and is honoured under the name of Cyriacus. During the excavation three crosses were found, but because the titulus was detached from the Cross of Christ, there was no means of identifying it. Following an inspiration from on high, Macarius caused the three crosses to be carried, one after the other, to the bedside of a worthy woman who was at the point of death. The touch of the other two was of no avail; but on touching that upon which Christ had died the woman got suddenly well again. From a letter of St. Paulinus to Severus inserted in the Breviary of Paris it would appear that St. Helena. herself had sought by means of a miracle to discover which was the True Cross and that she caused a man already dead and buried to be carried to the spot, whereupon, by contact with the third cross, he came to life. From yet another tradition, related by St. Ambrose, it would seem that the titulus, or inscription, had remained fastened to the Cross."<br>  <br>  For the record though, the Romans used to keep order in their own army by randomly executing one out of every 10 soldiers every now and then, just to keep order.  I don't think we have a record of any of their names, just that this was a practice of theirs.|`|ouXrNitMaa	Aside from what was written in the Bible centuries ago, nope.|`|EAigtBDBaa	There is proof but you might not accept it.

G2yUpoqfaa	According to Gratian, canon law, the law of the church, exists on the borders between law and theology.  Dante thought of Gratian as a pre-eminent teacher since he awarded him a place between two other teachers, Albertus, who taught Thomas Aquinas.  Medieval intellectuals knew also Gratian and Aquinas through the textbooks which they had written and which were used in the teaching of canon law and theology.These two were the twin pillars on which theology built its compendium, the summary of learning at that time.  The usefulness of their works is attested to by the hundreds of commentaries that have survived.  Gratian's Decretum was a valid law book, the oldest and most voluminous part of the so-called Corpus iuris canonici, in Catholic ecclesiastical courts until 1917 (when the first Canon Law book was printed and organized by subject).  <br>  <br>  Thus, Gratian's Decretum is the words of the Early Fathers who were taught by the Apostles after their scriptural letters to their flocks had ended.   Here began the Patristic epistles  (letters on doctrine to the flocks) in the Second Century.  These epistles, like those of the Apostles, became bishop decrees to further explain and teach the sacraments to the catechumens.  Over the next many centuries the bishops decreed christian truths (decretums) to the flocks and these became known as Decretals of the Faith, the more expanded truths of faith on Christ's teaching by all the Early Fathers.  The Decrees ARE the Faith explained, the same as the Epistles. <br>  <br>  Each Council called by the Bishop of Rome admitted or corrected any Decrees unclear and they became clarifications of the Words of Christ as applied to the faithful.  Future Councils clarified again, decretal and scripture.  They contained the same force as the words of the Apostles and are directly connected to scripture.  The collection of these discussions is called the dicta before becoming decretal. This original Decretum is actually a text which survives and can be read in medieval manuscripts.  Hence it has become possible to study Gratian's original book, and to know his sources were authentic Catholic bishops and fathers.|`|8465ed09a7111e9ef73563fd6ed0ec22aa	You need to distinguish between authority and discipline or the answer will forever escape you. <br>  <br>  Christ the Lord, indeed, did not in the least wish to destroy the very rich heritage of the law and the prophets which was gradually formed from the history and experience of the people of God in the Old Testament, but he brought it to completion (cf. Mt. 5:17) such that in a new and higher way it became part of the heritage of the New Testament. Therefore, although in expounding the paschal mystery St. Paul teaches that justification is not obtained by the works of the law but by means of faith (cf. Rom. 3:28; Gal. 2:16), he does not thereby exclude the binding force of the Decalogue (cf. Rom. 13:28; Gal. 5:13-25, 6:2), nor does he deny the importance of discipline in the Church of God (cf. I Cor. 5 and 6).<br>  <br>  Thus the writings of the New Testament enable us to understand even better the importance of discipline and make us see better how it is more closely connected with the saving character of the evangelical message itself.<br>  <br>  This being so, it appears sufficiently clear that the Code is in no way intended as a substitute for faith, grace, charisms, and especially charity in the life of the Church and of the faithful. On the contrary, its purpose is rather to create such an order in the ecclesial society that, while assigning the primacy to love, grace and charisms, it at the same time renders their organic development easier in the life of both the ecclesial society and the individual persons who belong to it.<br>  <br>  As the Church’s principal legislative document founded on the juridicallegislative heritage of revelation and tradition, the Code is to be regarded as an indispensable instrument to ensure order both in individual and social life, and also in the Church’s own activity. Therefore, besides containing the fundamental elements of the hierarchical and organic structure of the Church as willed by her divine founder or as based upon apostolic, or in any case most ancient, tradition, and besides the fundamental principles which govern the exercise of the threefold of-fice entrusted to the Church itself, the Code must also lay down certain rules and norms of behavior.|`|LJ6vHfgoaa	Like any other body of law (say, that of your city, your state, your gym, etc.), canon law is not "the authority"; it is rules "of conduct or action prescribed or formally recognized as binding or enforced by a controlling authority".<br>  <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/law" rel="nofollow">http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionar...</a>|`|jard50Yiaa	Canon law is internal ecclesiastical law governing the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox churches, and the Anglican Communion of churches. The way that such church law is legislated, interpreted and at times adjudicated varies widely among these three bodies of churches. In all three traditions, a canon was initially a rule adopted by a council (From Greek kanon / καν?ν, for rule, standard, or measure); these canons formed the foundation of canon law.<br>  <br>  Canon Law, the ecclesiastical law of the Catholic Church, is a fully developed legal system, with all the necessary elements: courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code and principles of legal interpretation. The academic degrees in canon law are the J.C.B. (Juris Canonici Baccalaureatus, Bachelor of Canon Law, normally taken as a graduate degree), JCL (Juris Canonici Licentiatus, Licentiate of Canon Law) and the J.C.D. (Juris Canonici Doctor, Doctor of Canon Law). Because of its specialized nature, advanced degrees in civil law or theology are normal prerequisites for the study of canon law.
pj2bnJgjaa	"How can you know that you are saved?"<br>  <br>  A two-year-old boy was once staring at a heater, fascinated by its bright orange glow. His father saw him and warned, "Don’t touch that heater, son. It may look pretty, but it’s hot." The little boy believed him, and moved away from the heater. Some time later, after his father had left the room, the boy thought, "I wonder if it really is hot." He then reached out to touch it and see for himself. The second his flesh burned, he stopped believing it was hot; he now knew it was hot! He had moved out of the realm of belief into the realm of experience.<br>  <br>  Christians believed in God’s existence before their conversion. However, when they obeyed the Word of God, turned from their sins, and embraced Jesus Christ, they stopped merely believing. The moment they reached out and touched the heater bar of God’s mercy, they moved out of belief into the realm of experience. This experience is so radical, Jesus referred to it as being "born again." The Bible says that those who don’t know God are spiritually dead (Ephesians 2:1; 4:18). We are born with physical life, but not spiritual life. Picture unbelievers as corpses walking around who, by repenting and placing their faith in Christ, receive His very life. There is a radical difference between a corpse and a living, breathing human, just as there is when sinners pass from spiritual death to life. The apostle Paul said if you are "in Christ," you are a brand new creature (2 Corinthians 5:17).<br>  <br>  Those who now have God’s Spirit living in them will love what He loves and desire to do His will; they will have a hunger for His Word, a love for other believers, and a burden for the lost. The Holy Spirit also confirms in their spirit that they are now children of God (Romans 8:16). Those who believe on the name of the Son of God can know that they have eternal life (1 John 5:12,13).<br>  <br>  Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, "My speech and my preaching were not with enticing words of man’s wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power: that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God" (1 Corinthians 2:4,5). What Paul was saying was, "I deliberately didn’t talk you into your faith, but I let God’s power transform you." He didn’t reach them through an intellectual assent, but through the realm of personal experience.<br>  <br>  Suppose two people—a heater manufacturer and a skin specialist—walked into the room just after that child had burned his hand on the heater. Both assured the boy that he couldn’t possibly have been burned. But all the experts, theories, and arguments in the world will not dissuade that boy, because of his experience. Those who have been transformed by God’s power need never fear scientific or other arguments, because the man with an experience is not at the mercy of a man with an argument. "For our gospel came not to you in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and in much assurance . . ." (1 Thessalonians 1:5).|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4).

It was (and is) known precisely when this happens, the recipients speak in tongues, a miraculous unlearned prayer language that God leads His people in <br>  (Acts 2:4, 33, 39; 10:44-46, 1 Cor. 14:2, 4).<br>  <br>  To receive this one must belieev that one needs it and desire it above all else, "thirst and you shall be filled".<br>  <br>  This is called repentance. Water baptism is also commanded, showing no faith in self.  These steps bring you into salvation.<br>  <br>  You should then use what you have received by considering others that have it as your family and loving them as such.<br>  <br>  +++++<br>  It's a new start, like a seed must be buried and watered, so we are to be buried in baptism and receive the living water of the Spirit.  That's how Jesus began, just follow him, that's faith, don't add to this.|`|nrXCCf76aa	If you confess with your mouth, Jesus is LORD and believe in your heart that He was raised from the dead, you will be saved.<br>  Romans 10:4<br>  <br>  Basically, just ask God for forgiveness, that's the only thing.<br>  To get closer to God, however, pray often, read the Bible, sing praises, etc.(:|`|lsuT5whmaa	For whosoever Calls upon the name of the Lord will be saved.

The dead will rise from their graves, and be judged according to their works<br>  <br>  <br>  whats with the pray now nonsense mien fuhrer all you need is faith alone<br>  <br>  <br>  To those who believe that faith alone (Sola Fide) justifies our salvation:<br>  <br>  Nowhere in the bible does it state faith "alone" justifies, and this new doctrine was not heard of before the 16th century. Why did the Protestant reformers propose it and what authority gave it to them?<br>  "Come, ye blessed of my Father, possess you the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. For I was hungry, and you gave me to eat; I was thirsty, and you gave me to drink; I was a stranger, and you took me in. Naked, and you covered me: sick, and you visited me: I was in prison, and you came to me." Matthew 25:34-36. Are these not examples of good works? <br>  <br>  Consider the verses, "And behold one came and said to him: Good master, what good shall I do that I may have life everlasting? Who said to him: Why asketh thou me concerning good? One is good, God. But if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments. He said to him: Which? And Jesus said: Thou shalt do no murder, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness. Honor thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. The young man saith to him: All these I have kept from my youth, what is yet wanting to me? Jesus saith to him: If thou wilt be perfect, go sell what thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come follow me.<br>  <br>  " Matt 19:16-21. Are the above verses not filled with good works? How much more proof from Scripture do we need to show that Our Lord commanded us to do good works for our salvation?<br>  <br>  "For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with his angels: and then will he render to every man according to his works." Matthew 16:27. <br>  <br>  , "And every man shall receive his own reward, according to his own labor." 1 Corinthians 3:8. Again this clearly does NOT refer to faith alone, but to labor, which is works. <br>  "And if I should have prophecy and should know all mysteries, and all knowledge, and if I should have all faith, so that I could remove mountains, and have not charity, I am nothing." 1 Corinthians 13:2 (St Paul). What is charity other than helping the needy? Charity is clearly considered among good works. "And now there remain faith, hope, and charity, these three: but the greatest of these is charity." (1 Corinthians 13:13). This clearly puts charity BEFORE faith, so to say "faith alone" is all that is required of us is clearly contrary to Scripture.<br>   "Do you see that by works a man is justified; and not by faith only?" James 2:24. How much more plain can it be said that faith alone is not enough for our salvation? <br>   "What shall it profit, my brethren, if a man say he hath faith, but hath not works? Shall faith be able to save him?" James 2:14. <br>  <br>  "So faith also, if it have not works, is dead in itself." James 2:17. No explanation is needed for this verse!<br>  "But some man will say: Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me thy faith without works; and I will shew thee, by works, my faith." James 2:18.<br>  <br>   "But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is dead? Was not Abraham our father justified by works, offering up Isaac his son upon the altar? James 2:20-21. <br>  "For even as the body without the spirit is dead; so also faith without works is dead." James 2:26<br>  "Wherefore, brethren, labor the more, that by good works you may make sure your calling and election." 2 Peter 1:10<br>  In summary, justification by faith alone has overwhelming opposition in Scripture. Some Protestants have been known to reference other verses from Scripture in an attempt to show that works are NOT required for our salvation. However if one looks at verses that appear to speak negatively about works, they are clearly referring to works that glorify men and not God. Here we agree; works done to please men do not help with attaining our salvation|`|3cxJfevQaa	Performing one's duty. <br>  Calmness of being. <br>  Acceptance of current situation/life. <br>  Giving without an eye on the return.<br>  are some I can think of.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	Believe in Jesus and follow His teachings.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up.

FOzN3xwzaa	The fossils were formed during the Flood|`|9btru19waa	There were no fossils on the earth at the time period of Genesis. <br>  <br>  God created the dinosaurs and man on the 6th day of creation. Dinosaurs and man lived at the same time. Before Adam and Eve sinned in the Garden of Eden, there was no death. God gave the animals the grasses to eat and gave man the fruit of the trees to eat. After Adam and Eve sinned, death entered the world and the animals and humans began to eat meat. So God took the dinosaurs out for obvious reason. I think possibly with the great flood.

The allusion is to special spiritual gifts given to him to fit him for the duties of an evangelist. These were given, and were essential, in that first age.<br>  <br>  Which was given thee by prophecy. As the Spirit at Antioch said to the prophets, Separate for me Paul and Barnabas (Ac 13:2), I suppose a revelation was given that Timothy was to be set apart, and that he would be spiritually endowed for his work.<br>  <br>  With the laying on of the hands by the presbytery. He was ordained in the usual way, and at the ordination the Spirit conferred upon him new gifts. It must be borne in mind that the ancient evangelists had no New Testament to guide them, and hence needed special qualifications.The charism or spiritual gift, is that of the Spirit which qualified him for "the work of an evangelist" (Eph 4:11; 2Ti 4:5), or perhaps the gift of discerning spirits, specially needed in his function of ordaining, as overseer [Bishop Hinds].<br>  <br>  So probebly an Evangelist !
aGRJ6MPdaa	It can't be explained because it doesn't exist and goes against everything God created and teaches.

There's the right way, and there's the wrong way.<br>  <br>  This teaching of the Christian church is one of the most profound insights into the being of God that words allow us to make. And the words run out whle God remains and continues to be ineffable and almighty.<br>  <br>  We have God's revelation of himself to go on; written (in scriptures), experienced (by the nation of Israel) and demonstrated (in the person of Jesus Christ). God began his revelation of himself by taking a long time to get through to Israel that idolatry was a gross sin because there is only one true God - the Creator. He told Israel that he created everything by himself. Then Jesus came and it dawned on his followers that he had had a pre-human existence and that he was God manifest in the flesh. They worshipped him. He accepted their worship. The rest of scripture (after his resurrection back to heaven) teaches the Trinity but you can well imagine it took some time for Christians to get over the shock of worshipping Christ without being idolatrous. Yet they wrote that Jesus created everything! That he is the saviour! That he is to judge the living and the dead! Gradually, they began to form the words to describe this immense revelation but as opposers arose and verbally battled with them, they had to thrash out creeds that used language as carefully as possible to express this. But it's not necessary to be able to explain the trinitarian creeds in a theological manner. We enter into the reality of just who God is by accepting this revelation and as God becomes ever more real to us, we understand in our spirit.<br>  <br>  For the numpties who repeat the 1 + 1 + 1 = 1 garbage, it should be 1 x 1 x 1 = 1. Much confusion would disappear if people understood that you can have three persons who share the same being. You are a human being and so am I. Yet we are different persons. We share the being of humanity. Our personality is unique. So with God. There is only one being who is God. All three persons of the Trinity share that same divine being yet they have unique personhood.|`|RCLVr0Evaa	because the trinity is a concept only about 1600 years old.  some scriptures in the new testament that supposedly support it, like 1 john 5:7, are proven forgeries and didn't appear in the bible until about 900 AD|`|RgceFQ9Caa	It is confusing because it is a bunchabunk.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gnmagazine.org/booklets/WG/isgodatrinity.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.gnmagazine.org/booklets/WG/is...</a>|`|1gA07a1Caa	because it's not logical and Non-science at all ..how could 3 = 1|`|PFzqpxQ7aa	The only Holy Trinity is Carlos Tevez, Cristiano Ronaldo, and Wayne Rooney!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://softmelon.wordpress.com" rel="nofollow">http://softmelon.wordpress.com</a>|`|DDwecKakaa	white lie, little lie, big lie.

Here is the Trinity as believed and taught by the true Christian Church:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ccel.org/creeds/athanasian.creed.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ccel.org/creeds/athanasian.cr...</a>|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Its confusing because it is Not from God.<br>  “God is a God, not of disorder, but of peace.” (1?Cor. 14:33)|`|AA11622701	Of course there is more than one way you can try to explain the Trinity.  Just as there are different techniques you can use to explain just about anything.  For example, many children learn to do counting and adding using their fingers.  However my mother taught me using a abacus.  As a result I found that I often "think" a little different about how to do a math problem that a person who learned on their fingers.  But in the end, 2 + 2 still equals 4.<br>  <br>  Some people find it easier to thing of the person of the Trinity as a progression - God the Father became God the Son and then God the Holy Spirit.  But in the end, they have three that are one.<br>  <br>  Others thing of them as different "parts" of God, like the parts of an egg.  But in the end, they have three that are one.<br>  <br>  I personally like the idea that God reveals himself as a person in each of the different realms that man touches - the Father in the spiritual/heavenly realm, the Son in the physical realm, the Holy Spirit in the heart/mind realm.  But in the end, i have three that are one.<br>  <br>  No analogue of what the Trinity is "like" will ever be perfect.  If you look only at the analogue and not the real thing, you will of course end up with "difference" between the different analogies.  But none of that alters what the real Trinity is like.

Also if there was someone who testified to try and save there own life there might be a special circumstance. All in all for sure the Preachers, judges and the towns leaders will go to hell.

To bless or curse someone is biblical, to enchant some one to your will is not permitted, to call upon demons is not permitted, to speak to evil spirits is not permitted,<br>  When a witch does a spell is it not the same as prayer the difference is who they are speaking to, When a Christian blesses a meal is it not done by the power of the holy spirit in them. anything done by any other powers is rebellion against good for you are not doing things according to Gods will but by your own.<br>  <br>  The majority of the ones they killed as witches where in fact saints that kept the true way of Christ as the bible says they have the blood of the saints on there hands and they will not be getting away with it.|`|de109ccf1349bcb7dcc5e78fb10fcbe6aa	I personally don't believe in hell... but, they did break their own commandment from their god by killing innocent people so you would think they would go to their hell for it. <br>  That was a horrible time, you could be accused and put to death just because someone did not like you or owed you money. You do know it started with little girls who got caught dancing with their slave (dancing was forbidden) so they said she was a witch and put a spell on them that made them disobey. When they saw how well that worked getting them out of trouble they begin saying that people they didn't like were witches even pretending to be under spells at the trials.

Sadly, I believe so.<br>  Even if they were genuine believers and did the wrong thing, does that change the truth of the Gospel, or the truth of Jesus Christ?

Jesus also said do not kill and to turn your cheek when you are hit. Jesus also allowed himself to be killed and told Peter to put down his sword after he cut off the ear of the servent of the priest. The bible says inorder to go to heaven you must be a christian. Jesus said you will know who my people are by their actions. A tree without fruit will be cut down. <br>  The tree is people and the fruits are those of either the Holy Spirit or the sin nature. If you contain the fruits of the sin nature you will not make it to heaven. Jesus said if you love me you will obey me.<br>  <br>  So the point is all those "christians" who were going around killing people regardless if they were guilty or not were still killing therefor they were murders and they were not having the fruits of the spirits and I bet anyone who can kill like that also does alot of other bad stuff so unless they repented and asked for forgivness they would be cast into hell.<br>  <br>  So yes it is the though that counts. God judges you by your heart. Those people were not killing for Jesus because Jesus is against killing. They killed out of sadism, killer lust, paranoia, fear, and sop on. But they did not kill out of the love of God. For one you cant really be a christian and go aroud killing people. Faith without deeds are dead. True faith is shown in deeds.<br>  <br>  So it is not me saying they are going hell it is the bible and its verses that are letting us know who is and who is not to a degree.<br>  <br>  The Greek New Testament and Septuagint on Witchcraft <br>  Witchcraft occurs only once in the King James New Testament and sorcery twice--Galatians 5:20, Revelation 9:21 and 18:23. The word in the Greek New Testament in all three cases is pharmakeia, derived from the word pharmakon ("drug"), the source of the English word pharmacy and its cognates. The standard koiné Greek-English Lexicon translates the word as "sorcery" or "magic," but its cognate "sorcerer" (pharmakous) used in Revelation 21:8 and 22:15 is translated "mixer of poisons" as well as "magician." The root of both words, pharmakon, literally means "poison" or "drug."1<br>  <br>  A few key Old Testament passages about witches which are often associated with the puritans such as Exodus 22:18 ("Thou shalt not suffer a witch to live"--KJV) use pharmakous in the Septuagint--the word translated sorcerer in Revelation 21:8 and 22:15.2 The Greek New Testament and the Septuagint version of the Hebrew Scriptures use different words such as mageia ("magic") when other types of occult practices like calling on spirits or using curses are meant. In English such words are usually translated "wizard," "necromancer," or some other appropriate word or phrase. Because of the Greek word chosen in each case, it appears that the New Testament authors and Septuagint translators understood the idea of witchcraft in terms of the use of drugs or poisons.|`|5shqstYraa	Thou shalt not kill.

9Ur1VL9Paa	I'm sorry but you are way off the mark here.<br>  <br>  Firstly; we have plenty of arguments against religion besides our "disdain" for it.<br>  <br>  1. It doesn't add up; and makes very little sense<br>  <br>  2. It contradicts itself<br>  <br>  3. There are so many religions; so how could you possibly say which one is correct (if any at all)<br>  <br>  4. Many religions; particularly Christianity could hardly be defined as legitimate. Nothing in it or its bible is original. It took its ideas from Paganism, Greek Mythology an Egyptian Mythology (to name but a few). This is a proven fact by the way; not an opinion.<br>  <br>  5. The theory of "natural selection", "evolution", and "the big bang", strongly suggest that the universe was not created by a higher being.<br>  <br>  6. Religion is the main cause for most of the wars and violence through out human history. I'm saying this because it's a simple historical fact; my feeling towards religion is irrelevant nor does it change the facts. <br>  <br>  <br>  You say we seemingly forget to deny the limitations of logic. In my opinion and experience of observing logic; it does not posses any limitations (none that I know of). Lets look at the main definition of "Logic". A particular method of reasoning or argumentation; in other words the ability to think rationally. I understand that rationality is an aspect in which is not present in all religious people (I won't generalise here). But if we didn't use logic to think clearly; we would hardly be thinking clearly at all. We would be like wild animals; with no sense of tact whatsoever. The more logical you can be about anything; the more progress you can make; and there is no limit to that. Its just that many religious people haven't even tried to explore it.<br>  <br>  Project our views as truth? We only project facts as truth. And for anything to be regarded as truth or fact; it needs to be proven as such. And no Atheist no matter how obnoxious he / she may seem (and we are not all obnoxious by the way), will never say something is fact without something to back up their claim. We do not claim we know for a fact that gods do not exist. However we support the very strong theories in which point towards the non-existence of gods and there is a very big difference with that.<br>  <br>  We claim we don't use faith because we simply and honestly don't. We use whatever tools we have to base an argument; the only tools we have is fact; backed up by proof. And when proven facts are not available in certain circumstance we use theories. A theory can contain many mini facts within it; but yet still not enough to come up with a final conclusion. Unlike faith; theories ARE questioned; as often as is required in order to solidify the argument and sometimes it is changed so much that the theory is no longer a theory; but a proven fact. Faith on the other hand is very rarely questioned; and some consider it an insult to question a religious faith. And because it is never questioned; religious groups protect and prevent themselves and their organisations from being unravelled; so to speak. <br>  <br>  I rest my case...thank you! thank you! **bows*|`|d7c8ecd624fbbc0797b1502ba6682e8baa	I don't deny the limits of any of these. But as limited as they are, they can demonstrate clearly that faith adds nothing of explanatory value. <br>  <br>  Any belief, religious or not, that has to be accepted with inadequate evidence, is unreasonable. That leaves virtually nothing about religion to speak of.|`|o4UrRbTvaa	You are misinformed as usual, which isn't hard to believe.  What I do find hard to believe is how a Level 5 can still be a troll.  That is totally mind boggling.|`|FCNAf6NTaa	You are mistaking religious faith ("belief despite a lack of evidence") with faith as used in everyday conversation ("belief based on evidence.")<br>  <br>  So having faith that the pizza will arrive on time is based on previous positive delivery experiences. Faith in god involves no such prior experience. <br>  <br>  The simple lack of evidence for god (any god) coupled with satisfying naturalistic explanations for much of what we percieve leads me towards atheism out of respect for my senses. They behave consistently. I trust them. <br>  <br>  I find it hard to believe you can't understand my need for evidence. Do you believe in buddah?  Why not?  Using your argument you should. Or maybe you could use your lack of belief in budday to help you understand my lack of belief in the christian god. Don't dignify your weak position with frivolous window dressing. My position is the only clear one to take. Yours is only present because someone told you it was true.|`|OeAfpIZAaa	What limits?<br>  <br>  I love how Christians try to make atheism a faith-based matter. That essentially means they admit, that faith is based on nonsense.|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Err...we don't have to argue against it until it actually presents some evidence.  Got any yet???|`|399b8d4579ac145bf601ea2ecd4bf934aa	umm...no<br>  <br>  It's the other way around.

LpyEAcjeaa	Apparently nothing<br>  <br>  Behold, the two premises of creationism:<br>  <br>  A.) "Everything must have a creator"<br>  <br>  B.) "Not Everything must have a creator."|`|758cae615235590fa29ef1d7060ba6d7aa	If God created the universe, then who created God?<br>  A number of sceptics ask this question. But God by definition is the uncreated creator of the universe, so the question ‘Who created God?’ is illogical, just like ‘To whom is the bachelor married?’ <br>  So a more sophisticated questioner might ask: ‘If the universe needs a cause, then why doesn’t God need a cause? And if God doesn’t need a cause, why should the universe need a cause?’ In reply, Christians should use the following reasoning: <br>  1. Everything *which has a beginning* has a cause.<br>  2. The universe has a beginning. <br>  3. Therefore the universe has a cause. <br>  It’s important to stress the words in *in asterisks*. The universe requires a cause because it had a *beginning*, as will be shown below. God, unlike the universe, had *no beginning*, so doesn’t need a cause. In addition, Einstein’s general relativity, which has much experimental support, shows that time is linked to matter and space. So time itself would have begun along with matter and space. Since God, by definition, is the creator of the whole universe, he is the creator of time. Therefore He is not limited by the time dimension He created, so has no beginning in time—God is ‘the high and lofty One that inhabiteth eternity’ (Is. 57:15). Therefore He doesn’t have a cause.<br>  In contrast, there is good evidence that the universe had a beginning. This can be shown from the Laws of Thermodynamics, the most fundamental laws of the physical sciences.<br>  ? 1st Law: The total amount of mass-energy in the universe is constant. <br>  ? 2nd Law: The amount of energy available for work is running out, or entropy is increasing to a maximum. <br>  If the total amount of mass-energy is limited, and the amount of usable energy is decreasing, then the universe cannot have existed forever, otherwise it would already have exhausted all usable energy—the ‘heat death’ of the universe. For example, all radioactive atoms would have decayed, every part of the universe would be the same temperature, and no further work would be possible. So the obvious corollary is that the universe began a finite time ago with a lot of usable energy, and is now running down.<br>  Now, what if the questioner accepts that the universe had a beginning, but not that it needs a cause? But it is self-evident that things that begin have a cause—no-one really denies it in his heart. All science and history would collapse if this law of cause and effect were denied. So would all law enforcement, if the police didn’t think they needed to find a cause for a stabbed body or a burgled house. Also, the universe cannot be self-caused—nothing can create itself, because that would mean that it existed before it came into existence, which is a logical absurdity.<br>  <a href="Http://creationontheweb.com/content/view/1851" rel="nofollow">Http://creationontheweb.com/content/view...</a>|`|cd7a815aadd36875b0d7dabeed6e75bfaa	It's not a difficult question, but rather a difficult concept for us to wrap our tiny brains around.

If you deny God, then you have to deny your own existence, which is impossible. No matter how knowledgable or intelligent you are, you cannot deny that there has to be a supernatural force that has created our planet and our body and, that creator is God.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet? Why should I see him as God?<br>  <br>  Pasting a small part from the website.<br>  Visit the website to strengthen your faith in Jesus or to know more about Him.<br>  <br>  Jesus is God.<br>  <br>  1.Thomas calls Jesus God in John 20:28 (Note, Thomas addresses Jesus<br>  specifically.)<br>  2. Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

So for God to prevent evil actions would be to take away the will of an individual.  Its the same as the CONCEPT and understanding of love.<br>  <br>  If a man is married to a woman, he wouldn't want her to love him because she has to.  He would want her to love him because it is her choice and honestly has love in her heart for him.  The same goes for God.  What good is it to make people love you?<br>  <br>  If God won't make you love Him, then I won't make you do what is right and prevent you from doing evil things.  Just like you have a choice to love others, you also have the choice to do evil.|`|t88527U1aa	God in his wisdom gave us a choice to follow or not.We choose evil before the fall we were without sin in communion with God we choose to disobey,and follow the fallen one.

It is Finished as Christ said!|`|D9lMg7A2aa	This evidences some instructive major logic problems.<br>  <br>  1 The fallacy of the False Dichotomy. <br>  <br>  2 The fallacy of emphasis (Aristotle The Sophistical Refutations has this one) You don't say the following<br>  IF God doesn't prevent evil, He is not good.<br>  Instead you put a double question in (another logic error by the way) and you say <br>  Is God able but UNWILLING to prevent evil? Then he's not good.<br>  <br>  3) And the error of Amphiboly/Equivocation...You want to be sure that no one picks Jesus as a counter-example so you use 'unwilling' in two senses...Obviously Jesus as God become man took on the evil and suffering and transmuted it but you mean 'unwilling to do what -- I -- would do'. How absurd .<br>  <br>  I'll stop there. Readers who are still confused should realize that the burden of proof is on the poster. Socrates, Aristotle, Plato all affirm on reason alone that God has all those traits AND is responsible for absolutely NO evil. <br>  <br>  Poster is like the people who put Socrates to death as an 'atheist' because he wouldn't uphold their theology.<br>  <br>  Same with Plato...look at all these things he said about the Greek gods, things that post er is trying to maintain.

"Is he able but not willing? Then he is malevolent." This completely ignores the fact that "evil" itself does not exist. It is a subjective term, and in a religious sense, which is the state of mind people generally are when discussing God, "evil" itself is the ...  Read Moreopposite of "good," (obviously), and "good" is God. So if a person does something evil, they've done something that goes against God. That doesn't make god malevolent, because the offense is just as much against God as it is against the rest of us."<br>  <br>  Your thoughts?|`|t5Nrj6Txaa	For the sake of argument, if you are good, then you will want for others to know what goodness is.  Without the contrast of evil, how can this be ascertained?  For example, a parent in the kitchen could always keep a child from touching a stove, or the parent could say, "Don't touch it, it's hot . . ." and allow the child to touch it.  In the first case, the child never gains the autonomy of knowing that the stove is hot, and why it is to be avoided.  In the second instance, the child will come to learn exactly why and will always remember.  Is the second parent evil, simply because they allow for suffering with the realization that their child must eventually learn to be autonomous?<br>  <br>  So I think the question has more degrees of feedom than simply benevolence and omnipotence, it could be the difference between a coddling god or not.
Gw1LLzDgaa	What is inside you makes you straight or gay -- not acts -- and certainly not relationships.<br>  <br>  Briefly explaining that.  <br>  <br>  If you desire males, lust for males, want males and DO NOT desire, lust for and want females sexually -- then you are gay.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter if you force yourself to marry a woman and stay with her for years.  The feelings will continue and you will continue to be gay -- just in the closet.<br>  <br>  Likewise, if you only desire, lust for and want females, you are straight -- it doesn't matter if you and your male friends fool around and have sex.  The feelings will continue -- and ultimately that will be your reality.<br>  <br>  If you desire, lust for and want both -- you are bisexual -- and you have more choices than either of the other groups.<br>  <br>  Men who are gay marry all the time, and give up the lie and come out of the closet all the time too -- after miserable years.<br>  <br>  Men who are straight often have sex with their male friends -- but don't say they are gay, and go about having a straight life.<br>  <br>  It's feelings, not actions -- always.<br>  <br>  Let me note however that if you are sexually attracted to guys' bodies -- you are at least marginally bisexual -- even if you do not want to deal with it.  But that's ok.  Love yourself and others.<br>  <br>  Kind thoughts,<br>  <br>  Hermes|`|z0kSza6Eaa	Appreciating the fact that someone has a nice body and being sexually attracted to them are two different things.  I can appreciate the fact that a female is beautiful and has a nice body, but I am in no way, shape, or form attracted to them, and I am definitely NOT straight.  You can look at a guy and say "wow, he's got a great body' or 'he's really good-looking' without being gay (although most straight guys pretend not to notice).  It's that pang of sexual attraction - you'll know it if you have it - that makes the difference.|`|oDdXpghDaa	No, you don't have to be in a committed relationship with a person of the same sex to qualify as gay.  <br>  <br>  And there's a difference between appreciating the beauty of someone of the same sex, and wanting to go buck wild with them in bed and love them.  A BIG difference.  I look at women models and strippers and stuff and think "wow, she's really beautiful" but have no urge to want to have sex with them.  <br>  <br>  What makes a person gay is "SEXUAL ATTRACTION TO A MEMBER OF THE SAME SEX" by strict definition.|`|VCz1CtiLaa	For me it's a sexual and emotional attraction.  <br>  I think a lot of men have nice bodies but it doesn't mean I'm attracted to them.|`|g3kORzIFaa	I do find certain guys attractive, and I've dated a few of them, but it never works for me. The whole time I was wishing that I could like them the way that I like girls, because the guys that I dated were all thoughtful and kind. And I also wish that there are girls who are a bit more like them. <br>  <br>  So I guess that answer your question? I am attracted to certain men but I'm not straight. And I don't want to be in a committed relationship with a men either, because I'm not straight. It's probably the same for straight people who find attracted to the same sex but don't want a committed relationship with them, because they're not gay.|`|IQiREB05aa	You know you're gay if you aren't sexually/emotionally attracted to the opposite sex.<br>  I can look at a guy and see that he is good looking but I would never be able to do anything physically with a man.<br>  Being gay is just something that you know. It takes years to realize it but once you do, and you come out, then it is such an amazing time in your life.|`|61wMfK9Uaa	So many people claim to be bisexual because they enjoy the company of both sexes.<br>  <br>  It has been said, but 'sexual attraction' is where you draw the line. This is why you should not need to experiment with both sexes before knowing. However a lot of people do this. Sometimes because they are legitimately confused. Usually for attention. Some people are just attention seekers. There are always exceptions, but bisexuality has very little logic to support its existance in anybody who has been intimate with more than a handful of people.|`|3a72219446c9a5a85bf1448f6d4a2860aa	Sexual Attraction to your own gender is the answer.<br>  Attempting to use 'qualifiers' is an attempt at rationalizing the truth you know but wish to deny.|`|LURqbzoZaa	Well...its sexual attraction to the same sex.

When I was in what I considered the "pits of hell", he forgave me.  He actually reached in my heart with his loving hands and healed all the scars of pain.  It felt like one big hug only multiplied by 1,000,000,000,000.  Afterward, he told me that he was always there for me with his hand stretched out, all I had to do was take it.  Since then I have been volunteering at a ministry and I see God working in my life, my friends, my family and daily I see strangers touched by the power of God.  What an awesome gift he gives me daily.  I learn every day new things and really try to grow closer to him daily.

Even when I was angry with Him, erroneously blaming Him for my pain and suffering, He remained, protecting me from my self destructive behaviors. He waited patiently for me to reach the end of self, and was there to pull me from the pit of despair. I have learned since that God does allow us to suffer pain and temptation, but not to drive us away but to show us what we really believe. I know now in Whom I believe, trust, rely on, serve, love, cherish, and wait for.. God in Christ Jesus reconciling us to Himself..."20 I have been put to death on the cross with Christ; still I am living; no longer I, but Christ is living in me; and that life which I now am living in the flesh I am living by faith, the faith of the Son of God, who in love for me, gave himself up for me" Galatians 2:20   I am now dependent upon Him alone, having become willing to death of self and to the things of this world, the suffering and pain that I endured seems to be as nothing for now I know that I am His,and that all things do indeed work for good to those who love Him, those He has called... and I am living daily in His presence.

I was to meet a friend to study the Bible but I was tired and called to tell her I didnt feel much like coming. She didn't answer so a d-r-a-g-g-e-d myself out of bed and went to her house kinda fussing as I went. When I got there she told me she hadn't studied so had called me to tell me not to come...I had left just before she called....talk about GOD'S timing! She was really depressed and told me that she had lost her car in the mall, had dropped an envelope somewhere in the mall with about a thousand dollars, and lost her keys. She said she was "losing it" and just didn't want to live that way. I could tell she was serious. I said a quickie prayer for the right words. I reminded her that if two of us prayed in Jesus' name and we agreed, that He promises to hear and answer us. We asked for God's will to be done. I asked her to call me when He answered and then I went home. I never prayed SO HARD all the way home!! I was like "God, I know sometimes your answer is "no" but I am begging you to answer this prayer "yes" to show her that you are really here and listening to us and that this will bring honor to YOUR name!"  <br>     The next night she called and had found the keys AND the money!!

He is just WAITING to help us and answer our prayers. He says if we draw close to Him that He WILL draw close to us!

I knew that nobody had ever loved me that much, and nobody ever would -- in this world, at least.  Because of that, I know for a certainty that everything that God does is out of love for his children and for their eventual happiness.<br>  <br>  Of course, scoffers will disdain, boors will rail -- but if I were going to invent any sort of a spiritual experience for myself, it would have been negative.  At the time, I just wanted to go to hell so I could get it over with.  I was suffering that much.<br>  <br>  The first time that I ever baptized anybody, I was filled with the overpowering, burning witness of the Holy Ghost that Jesus recognized my authority (priesthood office) and that I was working on his behalf.  From this I deduce that the restoration of priesthood authority occurred just like Joseph Smith and others said it did, and that Jesus really did establish my church.<br>  <br>  One time I was asked to give a short sermon on how to have the faith we need in times of trial.  Oh, I wasn't happy to get that assignment.  Now look, I have nothing against Latter-day Saints.  I'm one myself, though usually not very Saintly, so to speak.  But I could just imagine that congregation taking me out and tarring and feathering me for what I knew I would have to say.<br>  <br>  I stood up at that pulpit, more frightened than for any other sermon I ever recall having to give.  But when I began to speak, the Holy Ghost burned within my soul, witnessing of the truth of my words, and delivering a message that God wanted delivered with power into the hearts of the congregation.  My wife reminds me to this day that I should have listened to her and provided more examples.  What can I say?  I was so scared while preparing for it that I just wanted to get up, speak up, and shut up.  Nobody was more surprised than I was to receive that witness (by the way, I don't pretend that I am the best public speaker, I usually don't prepare quite as well as I should, and I have never received support like that during any other sermon before or since).  <br>  <br>  What did I say about faith?  The only thing I remember was that the best way to have faith when we need it is to develop it when we think we don't need it.

0aN1xIxfaa	We 'let' words affect us by either believing them or not believing them. To let the word of Christ affect us, we have to read or listen to His word. Then we accept it as His word; we do not resist it, or argue against it, or reject it. We let it in to our minds. Then, prayerfully, we entreat the Holy Spirit to apply that word to us personally. He causes it to sink down into our hearts where it becomes a mellow word, warmed by our love. Then we carry out that word in our everyday living. We are obedient to it. Then our lives are enriched by so doing.<br>  <br>  The more we absorb the word of Christ, the less we can be distracted by the subtle distortions of the evil one. The more we apply the word of Christ in our communal life, the more our brethren are built up in the faith. We do not isolate ourselves or just keep taking in and taking in. We fellowship and share the good word. That does not necessarily mean we must be teachers of the word (for not all are to be teachers) but as we are obedient to that word, we do things that help the Body of Christ to grow in grace. That is what Philippians 1:1-11 is all about.

To elaborate would take much time - but to give you an idea, the word “teaching” or “teach” is the Greek word {Didaske} = “to debate”. We get our word teacher from this Greek word. It’s used in the academic realm of a didactic coarse [a teaching coarse] But here is the beauty of this scripture. In our teaching methods there is no debate, but in the old Hebrew or the synagogue operation, anytime a teacher teaches, anybody who wants to get up and question him can do so.|`|r8rykCkGaa	Lots of times when I was feeling a crisis (more or less) I was even more eager to get into the word and the Lord would speak to me through the word.

But they also go out into the world to enrich all of Christ mind with love, whether we are aware of it or not..
4eLLjTzzaa	Jesus has been speaking of his work on earth; the work his Father gave him and the work he is handing down to the disciples and the future Church (the Father's chosen ones whom He has given to Jesus v.6).  <br>  So, Jesus is continuing to ask for strength, protection, and perseverance for the disciples in their present circumstances.<br>  <br>  The next petition refers back to his request that they be kept out of the hands of the evil one:  Sanctify--or set them apart for holy service to God--in the truth...which is His Word, the Bible.<br>  <br>  Ergo, the way for me to be strengthened and preserved in my holy service in this world, and to be protected from the Evil One is to be emersed in the Scriptures.  <br>  <br>  My experience of this truth looks like this:<br>  My circumstances may not change.  My circumstances are not God's priority.  God's priority is the perfection of his Bride out of the world (which is what this passage is talking about).  The way for me to resist the influence of sin, flesh, and the Devil (which, btw, are 3 distinctly different issues) is to stay close to God (in all three of His Persons) through his revelation in Scripture.

Many of the things which have gone wrong in our society have been the result of striving towards political correctness and attempting to come to terms with things which are contrary to the Gospel. We have to be prepared to stand out and speak fearlessly for what is right, as did the early Church.

UWlRLXvRaa	This is our purpose. It's to know God through Christ and make Him known. As Christ who was seen with the natural eye, reflected God who cannot be seen with the natural eye and so do we who have the Spirit of Christ or the Holy Spirit dwelling in our hearts.<br>  <br>  The degree to which we reflect God's glory is a process. It's something that we grow into. God's glory is heavy in the sense that it carries a lot of weight. There's GREAT substance to who He is and reflecting that weight in it's fulness doesn't happen overnight or over a decade. But as we walk with Him and dwell with Him daily, we are changed reflect Him from glory to glory. <br>  <br>  A baby believer may reflect Him in small ways while a "sage" in the faith may reflect Him in many ways. The important thing is that they are reflecting God where they are at. <br>   <br>  The good news is that He doesn't wait to live in us and through us until we've reached total maturity. He's doesn't wait until He's totally done remodeling all the rooms of our heart. He lives in us during the remodeling process. God gave the disciples the Blessed Holy Spirit in chapter 2 of Acts and not in Chapter 28.While they weren't perfect in chapter 2, they reflected Him at that place. They also reflected Him in the chapters between 2 and 28 and beyond. They also moved from glory to glory to glory!<br>   <br>  John commends those under his care in 1John 2 for reflecting God at whatever stage they were at - fathers, young men, and children. They all knew God & reflected God at their maturity level. John didn't condemn the children for not reflecting God like the fathers did. He encouraged them for reflecting God for where they were at in the process. <br>  <br>  This journey with God takes us to the place, where we reflect His glory fully. He is taking us to the place where we like Jesus can say confidently, unashamedly, and humbly, "He who has seen me, has seen the Father."|`|4Vswcoqeaa	Christ is the word-turned-flesh.<br>  <br>  So you've got all these words from God in your mind- but do the words manifest in your body?

HMOs, electronic medicine centers, medical supply houses and the like. <br>  Outside the industrial parks, new hospitals are popping up or expanding like mushrooms. There are drugstores on every corner. We are constantly being shotgunned by ads for drugs to cure or treat a plethora of diseases (all of which are identified by 3-letter abbreviations) imploring us to "ask our doctors if it's right for you".<br>  And yet the medical "profession" is always crying poormouth, and whining about losing money to "charity care". <br>  Congress is currently beating their chests about how they're "doing something about the problem" of child health care. And where do you think they're getting the money to pay for this? By raising taxes on smokers, not the medical industry. <br>  The medical industry is a scam.

MEwILtzBaa	First off, I'm gald you asked this question. There is a lot of misunderstanding that Islam demoralizes women, when in fact, that is not the case. Ignorance is passed down between people that know nothing of the religion and links are provided to mostly biased material (yes second poster I am speaking to you).<br>  <br>  As a Muslim woman, born and raised in the US and currently living in a Muslim country by free will, I will tell you this, I am respected. At work and at home with my husband, I am respected. I am a well off business woman who takes time out for her prayers and such and never have I been persecuted for being a woman.<br>  <br>  In fact, there are MANY Muslim woman who are taking such giant strides in society, that it's amazing, such as Queen Rania of Jordan and the Late Benazir Bhutto. <br>  <br>  The main reason women are usually portrayed in Islam as always being beaten and such is because most of these things done are based on CULTURAL beliefs and have no basis in Islam. This is a form of "jahiliyah" or ignorance. To justify wrong doings by reading one line from the Qu'ran itself is a sin. The people who hurt, murder, abuse, etc. women are the ones who bring their culture before religion.<br>  <br>  I recommend the following as a resource and hope that it may clarigy anything else: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Islam" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_Is...</a>|`|UWsyqLrwaa	Well, not all Muslim,married women are treated the same..I've lived in three Arab countries and I saw from the rich woman who have ton of money who lived as a queen to the "religious" poor woman who have to just pop out babies, cook, clean, and never go outside the house by herself..Some women lived like animals in a cage where they married the man that their families made them marry.Some live a long love story with a Muslim man that they marry afterward..I even saw a woman who had to share her husband with two other women; in Islam the man can marry 4 women.|`|gplfqOEHaa	Quraan is Islam and the rest is just talk.

If ye take a dislike to them it may be that ye dislike a thing, and God brings about through it a great deal of good. (Surah 4 Verse 19)<br>  <br>  “and live with them honourably”[al-Nisa’ 4:19] <br>  <br>  “And they (women) have rights (over their husbands as regards living expenses) similar (to those of their husbands) over them (as regards obedience and respect) to what is reasonable, but men have a degree (of responsibility) over them. And Allaah is All-Mighty, All-Wise” [al-Baqarah 2:228] <br>  <br>  And the Prophet (peace and blessings of Allaah be upon him) said: “I urge you to treat women well.” Narrated by al-Bukhaari, 331; Muslim, 1468.

I've never heard of the Monday/tuesday bit, however.<br>  <br>  Also, in the early church fasting was on both Wednesdays and Fridays -- year round, not just during Lent.  Jesus and the Jews fasted on Mondays and thursdays.  However, the early church changed the Monday to Wednesday because it was on a Wednesday that Judas betrayed Jesus and changed the Thursday fast to Friday because of Good Friday.  Somewhere along the line, the Wednesday fast kind of got dropped along the wayside -- but the Friday fast year round remains!

The message however is quite clear and not hidden at all.

I'm not a Biblical scholar, but I've read it many times.  Yes, I take it literally unless it is clearly a metaphor, like in Psalm 91 where it says that God covers us with his feathers.<br>  <br>  First, what would it have meant to it's original audience.  Second, being that I'm not Jewish and am part of the church, what is the principle that this teaches and how do I apply that to a 21st century American Christian.  Third, is there a personal message that God is sending just to me today. <br>  <br>  Those are the main ones.  Other than that I look for a consistency of symols and idioms that are in the Bible, and how this fits in.  In other words, wine is a symbol, an olive branch is a symbol, a fig tree is a symbol.  These things should be interpreted, from the first time they are mentioned and going forward, consistently.  I have a mystical bent also, but that is usually speculaton and I won't get into that!!!!|`|UinOWcMUaa	THE GOLDEN RULE OF INTERPRETATION<br>  When the plain sense of scripture <br>  makes common sense, seek no other sense;<br>  therefore, take every word <br>  at its primary, ordinary, usual, literal meaning <br>  unless the facts of the immediate context, <br>  studied in the light of related passages<br>  and axiomatic and fundamental truths, <br>  indicate clearly otherwise.|`|AIZvfgscaa	Your are partly right of course; the Holy Bible has many 'metaphors,' analogy's and poems; such as the Book of Job, which is a Jewish poem from which one takes the essence and learns from it. <br>  However, the interpretation of the Bible in general is always guided by the Holy Spirit, so that the true spiritual meaning may be seen, understood and incorporated into ones life.|`|f7fcb6877caa0ad4f41dd9af2258ee0aaa	I don't. Self-interpretation of the Bible is what has caused the doctrinal chaos of Protestantism.  I look to the one divinely appointed authority, the Church Jesus Christ founded for all mankind; the Church which compiled the Bible, defining under the guidance of the Holy Spirit which texts are divinely inspired and which are not; the Church to which Christ promised "whatsoever you bind upon earth is bound in heaven", and "the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth", and "he who hears you hears Me";  the Church which the Bible itself calls "the pillar and foundation of truth"; the Church whose divinely appointed chief shepherd alone holds the keys to the kingdom, the universal symbol of supreme authority; the Church which has taught in unity and in truth for 2,000 years; the Church which has not fragmented into thousands of conflicting manmade denominations over its inability to interpret Scripture authentically; the only Church founded by Jesus Christ and the only Church approved by Him, the Holy Catholic Church.|`|a48cfffc5a668f8ee11c890acdaf3ccfaa	A Bible verse should be interpreted using other Bible verses.  Example, the key to understanding most of the symbolism in Revelations can be found in Daniel.|`|AA10034051	Private interpretation is forbidden.<br>  <br>  Is private interpretation of the Bible condoned in the Bible Itself?  No, it is not (2 Peter 1:20).  Was individual interpretation of Scripture practiced by the early Christians or the Jews?  Again, "NO" (Acts 8:29-35).  The assertion that individuals can correctly interpret Scripture is false.  Even the "founder" of Sola Scriptura (Martin Luther), near the end of his life, was afraid that "any milkmaid who could read" would found a new Christian denomination based on his or her "interpretation" of the Bible.  Luther opened a "Pandora's Box" when he insisted that the Bible could be interpreted by individuals and that It is the sole authority of Christianity.  Why do we have over 38,000 different non-Catholic Christian denominations?  The reason is individuals' "different" interpretations of the Bible.<br>  Can there be more than one interpretation of the Bible?  No.  The word "truth" is used several times in the New Testament.  However, the plural version of the word "truth" never appears in Scripture.  Therefore, there can only be one Truth.  So how can there be over 38,000 non-Catholic Christian denominations all claiming to have the "Truth" (i.e., the correct interpretation of the Bible)?  For that matter, aren't ALL non-Catholic Christians as individuals claiming "infallibility" when it comes to interpreting the Bible?  Catholics only believe in the infallibility of the Papacy as an office.  Which is more believable - one office holding infallibility or 400 million non-Catholic Christians who can't agree on the interpretation of Scripture all claiming "infallibility?"  When it comes to interpreting Scripture, individual non-Catholic Christians claim the same infallibility as the Papacy.  If one were to put two persons of the "same" non-Catholic Christian denomination (i.e., two Presybterians, two Lutherans, two Baptists, etc.) in separate rooms with a Bible and a notepad and ask them to write down their "interpretation" of the Bible, passage for passage, shouldn't they then produce the exact same interpretation?  If guided by the Holy Spirit as Scripture states, the answer should be "Yes."  But would that really happen?  History has shown that the answer is "No."  Now, in the case of Catholics, the Church which Christ founded and is with forever (Matthew 28:20) interprets the Bible, as guided by the Holy Spirit, (Mark 13:11) for the "sheep" (the faithful).  The Church (not individuals) interpret Scripture.  In Catholicism, Scripture is there for meditation, prayer and inspiration, not for individual interpretation to formulate doctrine or dogma.|`|MdyHKQRGaa	They interpret it in so many ways...<br>  <br>  Holy documents have a tendency of being subject to personal interpretation.<br>  <br>  And the people who interpret it different from each other take turns at insulting other sects for having the wrong message.

Like Norman Geisler and Ravi Zacharias , Josh mc Dowell etc|`|AA10202389	Your Answer:<br>  I think you can take the Bible literally and learn lessons for now also. Life is only a metaphor in the brain. The mind only deals with metaphors. Unless we find the ideas are more real than reality and that ideas create our reality. Then, in the end, metaphors are more real or useful than reality as that is how the mind works and how we create our reality. With Quantum Physics the Bible is looking more and more literal.<br>  Christians just listen to their church. Thinking yourself is dangerous and demonic thoughts may get in. We don't want to have to deal with spirits. Of course Angels are spirits so they and God are kept out also, but that's the price you have to pay for fear and mindlessness. What's wrong with that? Are you trying to twist my mind with thoughts from the Devil? I have to add, for our non thinking Christian friend that I'm only kidding. But really, have you no guts to read the Bible and decide for yourselves, or do you have to let someone else decide for you, maybe the decider or the Sergeant or the government or the Republicans?How was our confidence in ourselves stolen. <br>  You can't just take some scriptures, here a little, there a little and make up any lie you want. Well you do or someone does it for you and you are being deceived, just like the church of old. It was a lesson for today. Don't follow others, blindly or otherwise. Don't you have the Helper to guide you. If not then something is wrong. Can't you see that? You have to take the leaders to task and not be afraid to correct them. Of course they will kick you out, so you'd rather compromise and sell out. The few errors you notice in popular doctrines of your denomination hides thousands you don't see. Of course we can't see what we don't know, but we have to find out. A lover of God, and God is also truth, will seek the truth. I suppose we can drift, but it's pretty dangerous to trust the ones you trust most. Your friends do you in. Your enemies can't get in and it turns out they reveal the truth about you. Life is infinitely complex and therefore infinitely interesting. To believe is to have faith. Faith is in something. Faith that the life of Christ is what we are following. A name is a word. How can you follow a word and not the man and His teachings. If you did, your 'enemies' would be in your hands rather than the other way around. Y'all be in a corner of your own making. It's hard to get the beam out of your own eye. It's a daily, hourly fun job. <br>  I'm sorry, but spirituality is just like physics. If you don't apply it you can't expect to get the results. Even if in a way you can, like let welfare take care of you, it's much better to think for yourself, it's so satisfying. Anywhere discussion isn't allowed is mind control, communism or fascism and book burning. It's not necessary if you really know the truth. Truth is not so fragile. Ignorance is. If you really believe in the Bible, don't let anyone get between you and the Bible. If you really believe in God, it's a personal relationship, not a threesome. Maybe you need a mediator to talk to your wife sometimes. If your life isn't going so well, maybe it's because you haven't grown up enough to talk to God yourself and get intuitions from Him, the still small voice of Ezekiel, then that's bad. And if He doesn't answer, there's a communication problem. It's not an acceptable situation. Don't accept it anymore than abusing your wife by not listening to her. The Muslims have God at an even greater distance, but we are not too much ahead of them, so don't brag. All this New Age stuff is people trying to reach God directly, and it's true the churches, we, have failed them. And it's true that they are having some success and some idiocy, but with the Bible and allowing the Spirit of Truth lead you into all truth, you will succeed marvelously. It's time to loose your chain, come out of Egypt, grow up and become a spiritual adult or continue to let governments, churches and authorities, educated idiots, tell us what it is and what isn't. Science finds we have the emotional intelligence of six year olds. I suspect we have the intellect of six year olds too. That wouldn't be so bad if we weren't whinny ignorant ones, but I am afraid that we are and that's the rest of the story. We just can't see our ignorance and immaturity. But others can and 'Christianity' is becoming a laughing stock. Not for where we're right so much as were we are wrong. That's what you have to believe in, humility or wait for someone else to clue you in that you are used to listening too. Unfortunately it's already been thousands of years. Priests are only commentators and not authorities. It's little different from the Church of old. If you look to Christ above churches opinions of Him you should be surprised. I know some people don't like to read and are afraid of psychology, a lot of it is useless, like everything else, but we have to test everything against scriptures for what we can use. We have to be educated. All knowledge in nature and discovered by man that's in books isn't from the Devil, but secretly so many feel that way. We weren't given a spirit of cowardliness, but a spirit of courage and power. We are not the sort to shrink back. I know you can have ten thousand arguments that there is little truth in what I say, but I don't see how you expect to succeed at anything with no effort. I don't see how you can think straight without standing on the shoulders of giants in every field. It's gutless and ignorant not to study to show yourselves approved and add wisdom to all your knowledge and get enough knowledge to add wisdom too. The Bible is a guide to life and study, not a replacement. Oh, well, "A word to the wise, a thousand words won't help a fool." I don't know who said it. Romans 11:25 is as true for us today as for Israel when it was written. "For I would not, brethren, that ye should be ignorant of this mystery, lest ye should be wise in your own conceits; that blindness in part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gentiles be come in." One man or church interpreting the Bible also could be looked at as private interpretation for the masses.|`|256t9bIqaa	You read it like any other non-fiction book.   <br>   <br>  Be aware of that there are 3 genres of literature in the Bible:   <br>  <br>  1)   Historical narrative<br>  2)   Poetry<br>  3)   Apocalyptic<br>  <br>  You read each type differently.     That means you have to be aware when you are reading poetry, historical narrative or apocalyptic.   Once aware, then you can interpret the Bible as the authors intended.<br>  <br>  To become aware of the genres, go to a book store and pick up a copy of the NIV Study Bible by Zondervan.    This Bible contains footnotes which helps one understand the features built into the literature.   Without this help, there's a 100% chance that one will indeed miss what the author said, or mistakenly read things into the writing which are not there.<br>  <br>  Here's a famous case in point:    Genesis 1 is a poem.   Now consider the number of people who think the Bible says the earth is 6000 years old.    That entire doctrine comes from not knowing that Genesis 1 is a poem, and then treating Genesis 1 as historical narrative.   In doing so, they read things into the Genesis creation story, and worse than that, they miss what Moses really said.     The entire evolution debate as well as corporations like CRI and Dr. Dino are founded upon the ignorance of not knowing a poem when they see one.|`|c38976723ee9b37f5c90f3768d12be59aa	Christians, how do you interpret the Bible?<br>  like a light in the darkness<br>  <br>  <br>  You've read a passage. <br>  <br>  yes<br>  <br>  Now what?<br>  <br>  with these words i heal a friend<br>  <br>  <br>   Do you place it in historical context <br>  no<br>  <br>  and read it literally<br>  <br>  yes<br>  <br>   unless clearly intended as a metaphor, <br>  no<br>  or read it to decipher hidden meanings,<br>  <br>  no<br>  <br>   and take it as a divine message for modern times?<br>  yes<br>   Both methods?<br>  no<br>   Some other way?<br>  yes<br>  bible is medicine|`|415b73f4e9911495575d995988a025aeaa	I interpret the Bible with the aid of the Holy Spirit, who manifests via the dogma of the Catholic Christian Church.<br>  <br>  Matthew 16: 18-19 says… “And so I say to you, you are Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church, and the gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.”<br>  <br>  Let’s break down this fundamental verse: Jesus says to Simon that his name is now Peter, a term meaning “the rock”. We know that Christ was speaking about Simon, not himself; for Simon permanently adopted the new name. <br>   <br>  Christ then says that he will build his church upon the rock, who is Peter. Christ states that Peter will be given the keys to the kingdom of heaven. By saying this, Jesus has not only established his true Church, the beginning of Christianity, but has also given Peter authority as the first Pope – the Vicar of Christ on Earth, the visible head of the Church. “The gates of the netherworld shall not prevail against it.” Meaning that the influences of the devil, demons, and fires of hell will never conquer the Church. “Whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.” This verse justifies the infallibility of the Pope. Christ is clearly telling Peter that he, as leader of Christ’s church, has been given the divine authority to continue Christ’s work on earth by issuing doctrines and dogma with the aid of the Holy Spirit. <br>  <br>  The Catholic Church is spelled out in black and white, right there in the Bible, as Christ’s true Church. There are solid records, preserved for the past 2000 years, to back this claim! All other denominations of Christianity have in fact broken away from Catholicism within the past 500 years, by the leadership of a mere mortal human being. The Catholic Church is the only Church that has been founded by Christ, and is the only one that can trace it’s lineage of Popes and Bishops in an unbroken line all the way back to Peter and the Twelve Apostles. As I previously stated, solid records exist to back this claim! <br>  <br>  And yes, the Catholic Church DID exist when the Bible was compiled, for it was created the moment Christ spoke in Mt. 16: 18-19! That is an indisputable fact.<br>   <br>  How can ANY informed Christian not realize the truth found in the Catholic Church?|`|wHxzPHKBaa	Well yea like everyone has been saying its a big metaphor...<br>  I'm not sure what to say, you can believe in what some old dudes wrote down at an attempt to keep society from falling apart as your life purpose  or go about and live how you think you should live.

Most use only the Bible. (although Mormons use the Book of Mormon in addition to the Bible)<br>  <br>  Even within a particular type of Christianity, there are variations. For example, among the Apostolic Pentecostal churches, there are a number of divisions. All Apostolic denominations agree on the Oneness of God and the plan of salvation. There is some disagreement between denominations on things like dress code, and some are more liberal on social issues.<br>  <br>  We are not forbidden to eat pork. Some Apostolic churches forbid alcohol. Others allow it in moderation. Some Apostolic churches feel that a woman's hair is her covering.<br>  <br>  How do we know the truth? Scripture tells us to study to show ourselves approved to God, a worker who does not need to be ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth. We study, always seeking for more truth. If we see that something we believe isn't biblical, we leave it behind. I have done this numerous times in my walk with God. And I refrain from judging those who see things differently. They may be wrong... OR they may be right.|`|ouXrNitMaa	Every religion has sects, because they're all maintained by humans.

I wIll attempt to answer just the first, if you submit each of the other one by one I will attempt to answer them if I see them, fair?<br>  A sect by definition is a portion of the whole.  Christianity is based on one book, the Holy Bible, and especially that portion of the Holy Bible that deals with Grace.  Grace being the theme of the NT starting with the life ministry of Jesus, his death and burial, his resurrection and the Gospel being opened unto all men--the Christ was sent to the Jews, rejected by the Jews and God told Peter, Paul and the other Apostles to go to the world, which are the others or Gentile.<br>  When a group of people take certain features from the whole, just maybe one scripture and isolate it from the whole, some will form around it as if that was the whole.  It is a breach of the orthodoxy of Christianity and forms an identifiable group still called Christian (questionable in some cases) but focus on this one or few differences.  Some examples may be the snake handlers, those who stopped using technology at some point of time, the forbidding of musical instruments in church.  It is only a sect if carried to the extreme and is very narrow in scope.  Back to our examples, some faith that are true Christian faith in that they practice the Holy Scripture almost as much as any other but still do not allow musical instruments in church.  They are not a sect by our definition. <br>  <br>  There are a few other examples I could give by name but will not in this forum: Their history and earlier practices suggest a legend of being Christian, but their unorthodox practices say other wise.  They are neither sect as we have discussed but known by the world as Christian but are not Christian either.  They are false to the teachings of Jesus, taking the role of authority or nature of Christ or God for their own purposes.  Some of their members are truly Christian but misled by a lifetime of nurturing under false pretense.  Jesus warned us about these and for us to be aware.  He said many will speak in my name but I never knew them.  Hope this helps.

The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23. Jesus says you must honor him even as you honor the Father (John 5:23).<br>  24. Jesus gives life (John 5:21).<br>  25. Jesus bears witness of Himself (John 8:18;John 14:6).<br>  26.

AA11690436	Perhaps heaven is only filled with single cells, only these cells have 92 chromosomes, instead of just 46.  We die, and all that we are, contained in a heavenly protoplasm, rises and reunites with another rising cell, our 46 chromosomes each uniting into a single cell of 92.  And it is the aggregate of these cells that compose the body of God.

Look, most Christians that hate (let's call a spade a spade, eh?) gays don't hate them because scripture says it's wrong.  Homophobia is as natural as homosexuality.  It's creepy and demonstrates incredible insecurity, yes, but it was around before gays and will outlast the laws that discriminate against gays.  So no, your getting the hate cart before the hate horse here.  Christians use the scriptures as a rationale for, not as an actual cause of their hatred.

WpA7n8Iwaa	Almost assuredly not.  But what I would do is read that to that person what the Torah says about disobedient children, and that would be enough to get them to straighten up, which is probably the point of that law.  The only reason that the threat of punishment has no effect in most countries is that there is very little chance that it will ever be applied.  If the threat were real, it would be a deterrent. <br>  <br>  Do I think it's messed up?  No.  I think every time someone is beaten, robbed or raped by a repeat offender, I'm reminded that there needs to be punishment for crime.  Will anybody be surprised the next  time Chris Brown beats the crap out of a woman?  Of course not because he will not be punished in the least for what he has done.  And frankly, you would save a lot more lives by punishing criminals the first time, rather than letting them go and offend again and again and again.  I'd rather see the criminal die than to see the constant stream of victims of repeat offenders.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	They'd be absolutely thrilled that they GET to...<br>  <br>  A fundie parent would love to threaten their child with "if you don't clean up your room , I'll be taking you out for a stoning!"|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Since I assume that I would be at least something like I am now, of course not.

592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	Establish a written policy about showing up for work on time. Make sure each employee gets a copy. Do they have to punch a time clock? That's always helpful, too. <br>  <br>  Then enforce the policy immediately. Keep a paper trail for a week or two, and then you'll be able to get rid of them.<br>  <br>  Oh, and do the drug testing thing, too. <br>  <br>  They can still file for unemployment, but you can dispute it when you have the paperwork.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	You can institute a drug test and you can also have a 3 strike policy; no show for more than 3 times is grounds for immediate termination.|`|H7L66ynJaa	You are new and keen.

There is likely a series of steps that must be taken, that would lead up to terminating.   <br>  <br>  You will have to be very careful with your record keeping.  Include notes of all conversations with the employee.  When they realize that you are serious about holding them accountable., perhaps they will shape up.  When you see an employee making good efforts to improve, make sure you say something positive to him.|`|yk4S7uuraa	Firing someone is never easy. In fact, the more times you do it, the harder it gets. <br>  <br>  Tell them that since the industry is dead right now, you have no alternative but to cut back your payroll, and leave it at that. <br>  <br>  Doing a drug screening brings in all kids of legal "mumbo-jumbo" that can cause problems that you don't need.<br>  <br>  Just do it, and get over it, the best way to do it is quick; as they say "hire slow and fire fast." It never will be easy.|`|rThIVk2maa	There isn't an "easy" way, but the one thing you need to do is document document document. Make note each time they do something unreliable, and send them an email about it, asking what their reasoning is. After you have a nice fat stack of these, you can talk to each individually and discuss how they plan to improve. <br>  <br>  Keep documenting though cause they won't.<br>  <br>  And once they keep screwing up, let's say, a couple months from now, you can take all your evidence to HR and let them know that you need new employees that are more reliable.|`|zR0YShRnaa	It can be enough yes. But if you really want to get rid of them you can tell them that the company has a surplus of workers and there isn't much work, therefore they are the ones who have to leave being the less productive.|`|blxlNHeCaa	you should start making your own records of absentees and bad work from those employees. By all means implement a drug test each month or every few months. Write up an employee manual that says what will happen if they fail to show up, fail a drug test, or do less than satisfactory work.|`|145811a27a6c8d5d7b012583d1de95f0aa	I would say you are going to have to create the history for the company.  Will you have that kind of power?  Set up performance evaluations.  Start seeing to it that people are being written up for infractions and that everything gets filed away.  Have attendance taken every day and make managers provide all pertinent data on employees.  I would say you will need at least 6 months to a year to build a reliable history.  <br>  <br>  You will have to have evaluations on a regular basis, let employees know how they are failing and what they have to do to improve.  Have all the pro and con feed back on record.<br>  <br>  Another thing you will have to do is talk with the department of labor in your State.  The laws in each State are different.  Find out from them what a good reason it would be to fire an employee and not have them be able to collect.  Half the time when their is a hearing the fired employee won't even show up and then the employer will win by default.  In addition, they will most likely be able to provide lots of good advice for managing your employees.  The Department of Labor is also a friend to the employer so it would behoove you to use this resource wisely.|`|O4jGlC2caa	I can't believe you run a company where there is no paper trail.  Do you at least have a written schedule?  You should have been writing "no call, no show" on a written schedule or keeping a written documentation.  The payroll could act as proof too.  If they are supposed to work 5 days out of the week, and they have consistently only been working and paid for 3-4 days out of the week, that shows they haven't been showing up for work.<br>  <br>  The drug testing policy may be a good idea, but it's going to be expensive up-front.  I had to pay for a 10 panel drug test for a rotation.  Cost me $40.  You also need to give them WRITTEN notice (and have them sign a paper for your records saying they received the written notice).  Then give them a surprise test sometime in the next 2 weeks and random drug tests thereafter.|`|WuhIoS1laa	Depends really on the scope of your duties. You may want to review what you intend to do with your own boss to make sure you aren't overstepping any boundaries.  There are also often  laws that determine how employees can be fired. Make sure you comply with them. You may not have any control over the laws in your state regarding un-employment.  You better read up and understand them.<br>  <br>  Check your company policy also. Make sure that everyone has access to the company policy.  <br>  <br>  Then start enforcing it with the blessing of your own boss.  Get the problems on record, and to be fair give them a chance to improve. <br>  <br>  If you take these steps you should be in the clear.

Hitler had a very similar philosophy, and it ended with over six million innocents murdered. <br>  <br>  Many religious people are very intelligent. You are stereotyping; stop it. You cannot even use proper grammar and syntax; why do you think you are so much more intelligent than a person of faith? Our human culture was built on religion, and that doesn't mean we need to follow our ancestors and not move forward. <br>  <br>  I am Catholic and Hindu, two religions of enormous tradition, but I believe very firmly in progressing the human race and making a better, more peaceful life for our children. <br>  <br>  Isn't that what we all aim to do? To live in peace, love, gratitude, and happiness? We all take different paths to that state of bliss, a state some people call God, others simply call "perfection," and still others call the future.

The right hand shows the fear-not gesture while the left is in the Varada (wish-granting gesture).<br>  <br>  The Abhaya mudrā ("mudrā of no-fear") represents protection, peace, benevolence, and dispelling of fear. In the Theravāda it is usually made with the right hand raised to shoulder height, the arm bent and the palm facing outward with the fingers upright and joined and the left hand hanging down while standing. In Thailand and Laos this mudrā is associated with the walking Buddha often shown having both hands making a double Abhaya mudrā that is uniform. The mudrā was probably used before the onset of Buddhism as a symbol of good intentions proposing friendship when approaching strangers. In Gandhāra Art it is seen when showing the action of preaching and also seen in China during the Wei and Sui eras of the 4th and 7th centuries. The gesture was used by the Buddha when attacked by an elephant, subduing it as shown in several frescoes and scripts. In Mahāyāna the northern schools' deities often used it with another mudrā paired with the other hand. In Japan when the Abhaya mudrā is used with the middle finger slightly projected forward it is a symbol of the Shingon Sect. (Japanese: Semui-in; Chinese: Shiwuwei Yin)[citation needed]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudra" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudra</a><br>  <br>  He was the son of Kākava??atissa and Vihāradevī, whose antenatal cravings showed that he would be a great warrior.

Incredibly, intensely, amazingly naive and stupid, but interesting. Because the only difference between atheism and theism is that when we look at everyday things, you see god behind it, we see logic and science. We are both 'devoted' to some form of explanation. the only difference is, atheism and science can explain so much in the world. It can explain just about everything in everyday life. Theism, on the other hand, is getting smaller and smaller, because what science cannot explain is getting less and less. So god has to hide in smaller and smaller holes and nooks and crannys (wikit words)...and your **** about talking to god, yes, pretty much everyone has, i cant even count the times i shouted at the sky and asked him to strike me dead and send me to hell. Sorry, there is just no evidence for god. Your **** about evolution REALLY cracks me up, because, you dumbass (sorry, i simply must rib on you for being so naive) we DID NOT COME FROM APES and NO ONE ever said we did. we had similar ancestors. Evolution is such obvious common sense. All it takes is genetic mutation (which has been proved countless times) and natural selection, which is just about the simplest common sense you can get.

It did happen so it could happen.  Once life started, it was just a simple matter of evolution over a period of time and bam, you have us.  When you know the science, it's not that incredible.

I see no question there at all.
h1IYS0dbaa	Before I answered your question, I read the article on "Historical Jesus" in Wikipedia. That article is rubbish. The reconstruction of the "Historical Jesus" there, is made under the precondition that Jesus existed, because otherwise, he wouldn't be in the Bible.<br>  <br>  That's highly problematic because the earliest passages in the Bible were written 35 years after the alleged death of Jesus. They were written by Paul who never knew Jesus by the way. The Gospels won't help you either because these were written between 40 years (Marc) and 100 years (John) after the alleged death of Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  Therefore, as you mentioned it in your question, it's wiser to look for another source but this time in other books and scriptures and these have to be from the period when Jesus was still alive.<br>  <br>  There is one single book without theological background where Jesus is mentioned. It's in a work of the Jewish historian Josephus.<br>  <br>  The following passage appears in the Greek version of Antiquities of the Jews 18.63-64, in the translation of William Whiston:<br>  <br>      3.3 Now there was about this time Jesus, a wise man, if it be lawful to call him a man; for he was a doer of wonderful works, a teacher of such men as receive the truth with pleasure. He drew over to him both many of the Jews and many of the Gentiles. He was [the] Christ. And when Pilate, at the suggestion of the principal men amongst us, had condemned him to the cross, those that loved him at the first did not forsake him; for he appeared to them alive again the third day; as the divine prophets had foretold these and ten thousand other wonderful things concerning him. And the tribe of Christians, so named from him, are not extinct at this day.<br>  <br>  This is the so called Testimonium Flavianum, the alleged written testimony a the existence of Jesus by a person who was alive when Jesus was alive.<br>  <br>  First of all, you shouldn't forget who copied such works during the dark ages again and again. It was the Church. It is said that this passage in Josephus's book is not authentic.<br>  <br>  To see why read here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on_Jesus#Testimonium_Flavianum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josephus_on...</a><br>  <br>  But one thing remains important. John the Baptist is mentioned many times in the book of Josephus and most historians think that John the Baptist must be a historic person who actually lived once and who had a certain importance that he was mentioned in Josephus' book and not only once. Do you get what I mean? Why is Jesus, if he really existed, mentioned only once in Josephus' book? How is that possible? Given the importance of his person (read in the bible how he allegedly entered Jerusalem, what happened after the alleged crucification (earthquake etc.), the alleged sermon on the mount with hundreds of people), it's quite astonishing that Jesus can be found only on one particular passage of a historian, which is even disputed! And the books of that historian are extremely detailed. There are many many people mentioned there who would be much less important than Jesus but they are there. Even if the passage is authentic, it's quite little what we find about this man who was allegedly the Son of God, whose walk to the cross and whose crucification was allegedly watched by thousands of people.<br>  <br>  One thing is for sure. Even if Jesus existed, he was not of any importance.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean that Jesus as an idea of man is not of importance. On the contrary. This idea is pretty much a great part of human history of the last 2000 years.<br>  <br>  Edit: Just read the answer of another answerer. Tacitus is of course not a proof of the existence of Jesus. When Pliny and Trajan exchanged those letters (in the year 109) he was already dead (if he ever existed). With the letter of Pliny, only the existence of Christians is proven. Same for the scripture of Tacitus.|`|NFK3A68oaa	Sensible question.  And this isn't defending the irrational and sometimes horrible things that fallible humans have done and taught, supposedly in Christ's name.  <br>  <br>  There is, of course.<br>  <br>  in A.D. 64, the Roman historian Tacitus wrote<br>  Nero fastened the guilt . . . on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace. Christus, from whom the name had its origin, suffered the extreme penalty during the reign of Tiberius at the hands of . . . Pontius Pilatus, and a most mischievous superstition, thus checked for the moment, again broke out not only in Judaea, the first source of the evil, but even in Rome.<br>  <br>  letters of Pliny the Younger to Emperor Trajan<br>  <br>  <br>  Even Jesus' avowed enemies, the Jewish religious leaders of his day, unintentionally bore witness both to his existence and his miracles in the Talmud, which survives to this day, by accusing him of performing his powerful works by pronouncing the Divine Name, YHWH (Yahweh or Jehovah in English.), which they normally kept secret.<br>  <br>  "For instance, consider the testimony of Flavius Josephus, a first-century Jewish historian who was a Pharisee. He referred to Jesus Christ in the book Jewish Antiquities. Although some doubt the authenticity of the first reference where Josephus mentioned Jesus as the Messiah, Professor Louis H. Feldman of Yeshiva University says that few have doubted the genuineness of the second reference. There Josephus said: “[Ananus the high priest] convened the judges of the Sanhedrin and brought before them a man named James, the brother of Jesus who was called the Christ.” (Jewish Antiquities, XX, 200) Yes, a Pharisee, a member of the sect many of whose adherents were avowed enemies of Jesus, acknowledged the existence of “James, the brother of Jesus.” "<br>  <br>  "Tacitus, born about 55 C.E. and considered one of the world’s greatest historians, mentioned the Christians in his Annals. In the account about Nero’s blaming the great fire of Rome in 64 C.E. on them, he wrote: “Nero fastened the guilt and inflicted the most exquisite tortures on a class hated for their abominations, called Christians by the populace.

I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist?

The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6.

AEZ75dJ7aa	I just finished a study on creation.  I learned that there were millions of years between Genesis 1:1 and Genesis 1:2- which includes dinosaurs, ancient civilizations, the ice age, the fall of Satan and the creation of demons.  With the restoration of Earth in Genesis 1:3. This was first approached, to my knowledge, by Finis Dake and explained in his book God's Plan For Man (originally printed in 1949).|`|AA12081312	I think it is quite possible that there were millions of years between Gen 1;1 & Gen 1;2.<br>  It is very dangerous for the Church to argue that the world is only 6,000 years old, when science say's it is much older.|`|wuPTBIIuaa	as much as i love listening to kent hovind discuss the creation in 6 days theory, <br>  it is possible that where it says God created the earth in 6 days might be a tradition, not a fact and the prophet wrote it as a fact and not as a vision.<br>  hovind rejects the Gap theory. <br>  but i can see it very plainly. <br>  <br>  in the beginning the universe is made. but the earth is not visited until the Lord jesus (pre-existent) comes with Heavenly Father and the host of heaven and the population of the earth yet to come! <br>  i am pretty sure God the Father is building his kingdom and giving his sons and daughters inheritance through the galaxy. <br>  albeit, there has got to be at least a dozen theories on genesis alone.
ybFg4umCaa	They don't believe that they do single out groups for persecution, but they do. They are christians, there is no basis for their arguments<br>  <br>  Not singling out groups like gays, Muslims, atheists, Mormons, Catholics, JWs. Yeah I know the last ones are sort of christian but you still attack them|`|N4ORX2fZaa	It depends on the "group"...  If you are talking about the people who commit murder and want it legalized, then the fact that they commit murder is the basis for the argument.  If you are talking about Gay Marriage, then the fact that people want to change the Definition of marriage is the basis for the argument.  If you are talking about abortion, then the killing of a developing human is the basis.  Take your pick dude.|`|VxrsfAfyaa	Who exactly am I persecuting?

But they have used their bible to back up many beliefs during history that what others are doing is wrong, and now are considered perfectly acceptable behavior in society.|`|xWi4ua0Iaa	They base it on the fact that it is not a powerful enough group to stand up to them.<br>  <br>  Case in point: In Luke 16:18, Jesus is reported to have said that re-marriage is adultery, and of course we know adultery to be part of the Big 10.  But divorce and remarriage is a big part of American Society, so you never hear any condemnation from the Christian Peanut Gallery (in fact, a Republican candidate that is remarried after a divorce is somehow more acceptable to the average fundamentalist than a black man during a presidential race).  But a couple of obscure references to homosexuality (a clear minority within the American Society) within the text - neither spoken by Jesus - is enough to bring the full brunt of the Fundamentalist wrath down within an election.<br>  <br>  I wonder what the divorce rates would be in the American Society if the same energy used to attack a minority group with lines from the Bible could be utilized to attack divorce (and remarriage, forcing people to really think hard about their commitment beforehand) with lines from Jesus?<br>  <br>  Instead, they look for loopholes to placate the majority, and look for hatred to attack the minority.<br>  <br>  EDIT:  Oh, look!  I got some thumbs down!

As pontiff he practiced the virtues he had displayed as a monk and a bishop. His piety was not diminished, and, in spite of the heavy labours and anxieties of his office, he made at least two meditations a day on bended knees in presence of the Blessed Sacrament. In his charity he visited the hospitals, and sat by the bedside of the sick, consoling them and preparing them to die. He washed the feet of the poor, and embraced the lepers. It is related that an English nobleman was converted on seeing him kiss the feet of a beggar covered with ulcers. He was very austere and banished luxury from his court, raised the standard of morality, laboured with his intimate friend, St. Charles Borromeo, to reform the clergy, obliged his bishops to reside in their dioceses, and the cardinals to lead lives of simplicity and piety. He diminished public scandals by relegating prostitutes to distant quarters, and he forbade bull fights. He enforced the observance of the discipline of the Council of Trent, reformed the Cistercians, and supported the missions of the New World. In the Bull "In Coena Domini" he proclaimed the traditional principles of the Roman Church and the supremacy of the Holy See over the civil power.<br>  <br>  But the great thought and the constant preoccupation of his pontificate seems to have been the struggle against the Protestants and the Turks. In Germany he supported the Catholics oppressed by the heretical princes. In France he encouraged the League by his counsels and with pecuniary aid. In the he supported Spain. In England, finally, he excommunicated Elizabeth, embraced the cause of Mary Stuart, and wrote to console her in prison. In the ardour of his faith he did not hesitate to display severity against the dissidents when necessary, and to give a new impulse to the activity of the Inquisition, for which he has been blamed by certain historians who have exaggerated his conduct. Despite all representations on his behalf he condemned the writings of Baius, who ended by submitting.<br>  <br>  In England, finally, he excommunicated Elizabeth<br>  <br>  In England, finally, he excommunicated Elizabeth<br>  <br>  In England, finally, he excommunicated Elizabeth

dF5clN4daa	Ephesians Chapter 1, Romans Chapters 5-8, 1 Peter<br>  <br>  God foreknows those who are His.  In eternity past God predestined His chosen ones to be conformed to the image of His Son, Jesus the Christ, and called them into an everlasting relationship.  And more than that He justified them, declared them righteous and sinless, through the offering Made by His Son (the blood of Jesus).  And those He justified He glorified, that is, transformed them into the likeness of His Son so that His Son would be the firstborn among many bretheren.  From God's perspective glorification is a done deal in the life of a believer.  However, from our perspective, it is a work in progress to be completed at the return of Christ where He gathers His own and changes our bodies from corruption to incorruption... death is swallowed in victory. <br>  <br>  As His chosen ones we are given the earnest of our inheritance which is the indwelling presence of the Holy Spirit to, among other things, comfort us until the day of the redemption of our body.  The Holy Spirit bears witness to our spirit that we are the children of God and the Spirit testifies to the truth of the scriptures.  You may ask "Why is scripture necessary if the Spirit can guide you to truth?"   That's an excellent question and I'm glad you asked!  We, the sinners saved  by grace, are not yet in our glorified form.... we are still in this earthbound sinful nature and are subject to those sinful traits that cause disputes, rivalries, divisions and the such...<br>  <br>  "All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness:  That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished unto all good works" (2 Tim 3:16)<br>  <br>  ...The children of God have a standard to use as the measure of truth... it is the "final word" in a christian's life... the Spirit will not disagree with Holy Scripture and the Holy Scripture will never correct the Holy Spirit... they are in complete agreement, unified in purpose and in the work in a christian's life.|`|hR7OsqtRaa	2 Timothy 3:16<br>  All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1:11-12<br>  I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel I preached is not something that man made up. I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it; rather, I received it by revelation from Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  2 Timothy 3:16 tells us that the Bible was "breathed out" by God.<br>  <br>  Galatians 1: 11-12 tells us that the gospel was a revelation from Jesus Christ himself, which was recorded by Jesus disciples and Paul.<br>  <br>  God himself chose the disciples and the people whom He knew were going to spread His word and write the Bible.<br>  <br>  The Bible was written by approximately 40 men of diverse backgrounds over the course of 4000 years. Despite being penned by different authors over 40 centuries, the Bible does not contradict itself and does not contain any errors. The authors all present different perspectives, but they all proclaim the same one true God, and the same one way of salvation—Jesus Christ (John 14:6; Acts 4:12).<br>  <br>  In John 8:58 "I tell you the truth," Jesus answered, "before Abraham was born, I am!"<br>  <br>  The above verse speaks a lot about who Jesus really is.<br>  <br>  All about Jesus and the Holy Trinity explained in the below website.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com" rel="nofollow">http://jesustrinity.blogspot.com</a><br>  <br>  Lots of videos, sermons, songs are also present, along with all of Jesus miracles, his parables, and questions on his birth, crucifixion, resurrection are answered.<br>  <br>  Many major questions on Christianity are answered with lot of examples that cannot be denied by anyone, such as,<br>  <br>  1) Did Jesus really exist? Is He God? Why did He suffer on the Cross?<br>  2) What is so special about Jesus? Why cant I just view him as an ordinary man or a teacher or a prophet?

Jesus is God in Heb. 1:8<br>  3. John the apostle states that Jesus was the Word which was God that became<br>  flesh (John 1:1-14)<br>  4. The phrase "Call upon the name of the LORD" (Hebrew, YHWH, i.e., Psalm<br>  116:4) used only of God on the OT, and translated into the Greek in the LXX as "Call upon the name of the LORD (greek, KURIOS)," applied to Jesus in the NT (1 Cor. 1:2) Jesus is God in flesh<br>  5. The apostle John says that Jesus was , "...calling God His own Father,<br>  making Himself equal to God," (John 5:18)<br>  6. Jesus said that He and the Father are One (John 10:30), that caused the Pharisees to<br>  claim that Jesus was making Himself out to be God.<br>  7. Jesus knew all things (John 21:17)<br>  8.

Jesus created all things (Col. 1:16-17), it is God who created all things by Himself (Isaiah 44:24)<br>  19. Jesus searches the hearts and minds of the people (Rev. 2:23)<br>  20. Jesus is worshiped (Matt. 2:2-11; Matt.14:33; Matt.28:9; John 9:35-38;<br>  Heb. 1:6) Only God can be worshipped (Matt. 4:10) (same Greek word for worship<br>  is used in each place.)<br>  21. In the OT God was seen (Exodus 6:2-3;Exodus 24:9-11; Num. 12:6-9; Acts7:2), yet no man can see God (Exodus 33:20; John 1:18). It was not the Father that was seen in the OT (John 6:46). Who, then were they seeing? See John 8:58.<br>  22. Jesus claimed the divine name, "I AM", for Himself in John 8:58 see<br>  Exodus 3:14.<br>  23.

And if you are not sure of the meaning ask a clergy for assistance.|`|AA11622701	Why do people trust in what someone wrote and declared is science?<br>  <br>  Usually helps if you start by actually reading the writings so you have some idea of what it says.<br>  <br>  In the case of a religion text, is there evidence to support any history contained within the book, for example.  While there is some debate about some events in the first 9 chapters of Genesis (creation through the Flood), the other 99.9% of the text is rich in historical evidence, both physical remains and writings by other non-Bible authors.  (And personally I see reasons to accept even that 0.1% that is not as easily proven.)<br>  <br>  In the case of science, is there only one scientist who advances a theory, or are there hundreds?  In the case of the Bible, you have over 40 authors, writing over a period of 1500 years, in over 60 books, on several different cultures and societies, on three different continents, who all claim to have spoken with the same God.  And who all record getting some answers, doctrines and teachings from him.  If this was a science text, in which 1500 years of science all got the same results from the same research and experiments, it would be considered a "fact".<br>  <br>  But I am not limited to writings of another.  Just like I could repeat a science experiment for myself to confirm the findings, so I have the ability to repeat the experiences of the Bible.  I can talk to God himself, and confirm that he is still doing and saying the same things that he did in the scriptures.  I need not rely on the ONLY the testimony of others, when I can talk to God himself.<br>  <br>  So there are many things that a person can use to support their trust in the Bible as the word of God.|`|Uq9qPZ75aa	God has knowledge of the past and future, it was past unto is in the Holy Bible.<br>  <br>  Genesis=Beginning<br>  Revelation=Ending<br>  <br>  The ending is true, so the beginning is true too!<br>  <br>  Just read it!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	By my life's experiences that you absolutely nothing about!!  <')))><|`|HrnlBc4Laa	saagieba,there could be thousands of answers to your question.  If you are not well protected, some will try to hurt you with words, these are children even if they are Christians.  If your question is sincere, I hope some will sincerely try to give you an answer.  Before you can receive any well meaning answer, you first have to believe there is a God.  God himself said that a person must believe that He is.  All others are said by this same God are fools.  Let me put it in a slightly different way: if a person can look at his world, the flowers, trees, animals, insects, oceans, star, moon, sun and all the other divers and magnificent things that didn't just happen and still say there is no God, he is a FOOL.<br>  Assuming you are not a fool, the Holy Bible of King James Version 1611 is inerrant.  Thousands of scholars and scientist have attempted to prove any part of it in error.  lesser people will take a verse here and a verst there and try to prove God in error, that is not the way it works, you know that and I do too.  These true researchers have attempted for what ever reason to prove it wrong.  Not one time, ever has it been in error.  There are 2.5 % what is called recopy errors, each have been traced back to the original manuscript and proven.  Each is cross referenced back.  The whole bible is authored by many writers, that is true, what you left out is they were inspired by God himself.  Now if you question that, I will give you some of my personal experience.  God's holy word is organic, meaning it is alive.  I have studied it for now on to 73 years less about six of those while learning to read.  I can and often do, read a chapter of a certain book.  It has happened often so the chapters vary and so do the book from which they come, now all are part of the bible we are talking about.  I read and gain some level of understanding.  the next time I may confirm or I learn a deeper meaning.  As my ability to understand and receive grows, so will God allow me to get a deeper meaning.  It happens to every growing Christian.  No other reading media have I experienced this organic nature and I have read thousands.<br>  <br>  Another proof the Holy Bible is a work of God rather than man is its phrophetic nature.  Thousands of years ago God inspired a man to write a phrophesy.  Long after the death of that phrophet, the event occurred.  This has happened many, many times.  Then there are things like medical information.  God suggested thousands of years ago that our diet include olive oil, the medical profession is now realizing how important olive oil is for our hearts and arthiritus health.  Moses told the Israelite to spend seven days completely away from fermented, or yeast products, that would cure the yeast infections so prevalent even today.  Doctors are now discovering that works.  Over five thousand years after God wrote the books using simple men.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|GwEEEyNRaa	Because they are too lazy to do the hard work themselves.|`|ab406a9a5d69ca0d2cc95e30217f543aaa	Ask a clergy member, if you have the courage, which I doubt.

rTmYpDTPaa	The modern day Knights Templar, as associated with the York Rite of Freemasonry, has no connections with the historic Knights Templar of the 12th-14th century. <br>  There is some limited historical evidence, that upon the dissolution and following persecution of the historic order, that some of the knights fled to Scotland and became part of the stone mason guilds there, and that many hundreds of years later these guilds would evolve into modern Freemasonry. While not wholly untrue, this is by and large legend more than fact. Former Templar knights became involved in any number of other trades following the end of their service, and distinct Templar influences can be found elsewhere, and often to a greater extent than within Freemasonry. <br>  <br>  What happened though, is in the 1850's, York Rite Freemasonry formed a kind of honor society within their ranks, and most likely based on the previously stated legend, called themselves the Knights Templar and decided to pattern themselves in spirit after the historic military order of the same name.   <br>  <br>  So the actual relationship is largely one simply based on inspiration and emulation, and is not, nor is it claimed to be, a direct decedent or underground continuation of the original Knights Templar.|`|stAeoUeSaa	They found ancient mauscripts about techniques to conjure and control demons from the time King Solomon went apostate.|`|GPmBB0Mvaa	The knights Templar were a band of knights that found secret passage ways underneath Solomon's temple that led to a treasure.

And out of his mouth there<br>  protrudes a sharp long sword, that he might smite<br>  the nations with it, and he will shepherd them with a<br>  rod of iron. He treads, too, the press of the wine of<br>  the anger of the wrath of God the Almighty. And upon<br>  his outer garment, even upon his thigh, he has a <br>  name written, King of kings and Lord of lords. ~<br>  Revelation 19:11-16|`|bVfVWFyMaa	He would be driving my Chevy Cobalt 2.2 LS turbocharged that gets 270whp 273twhp 0-60 in 4.9 seconds in-line 4 cyl|`|MdyHKQRGaa	Well if Jesus came back to Earth in America he would probably drive a Hummer like every other idiot in that country.<br>  <br>  @Capt.

QsbB6vkoaa	ok, suppose you die tonight, and you are unworthy of being on god's list because you don't follow his commandments, you would not go to hell. hell isn't a literal place, it has a very deep meaning but it means "complete destruction" Jehovah is not a god of hate, he is a god of love so he would never torture anyone by having them suffer in fire all the time. when he mentions in apocalypse/revelation that he will one day destroy satan and all his followers, it means that he will kill/destroy them forever and it will be like they were never alive, so if you think about it, in order for him to torment them day and night he would have to keep them alive, but he says that they will be DESTROYED.<br>  most Religions have a lot of opinions about hell, but that's because they don't take the time to get to the root of the meaning. God's words are very complex and you need a lot of time and patience to truly understand them. it's not so hard if it becomes a daily routine to study them and you have a superior that helps you understand when you don't.<br>  so in case you do get destroyed, you just wont wake up to god's new paradise here on earth. but the bible holds the key to you getting in to this magical place that Jehovah will one day make.<br>  i hope this answers your questions, and no you will probably not go to heaven, only 140,000 will go to heaven, and a few of those special people are still here on earth. the rest of us ( if god chooses us of course) will live here on earth and fullfill the purpose that god had from the beggining.<br>  the rest that don't make the cut, will just be forgoten, like they never existed. god wont wake anyone up just to kill them again.|`|4191bf22931e9cc7e405f80b732d50fbaa	Everyone is a sinner,but if one asks for forgiveness with a true heart,by talking to God in realization of all the sins that one has,and repents from their sins and tries to live a better life in Jesus,then forgiveness is granted and you will not be in a kind of Hell..so if i were you hit the deadline and start talking to God, before you die tonight.|`|f821e891c77524cf69e50d2bb5629d7faa	again what is heaven and whos idea of heaven are we talking about<br>  <br>  Mine would be the rest of eternity with my wife and the ones i love, to be the same person i am right now and not something i never was. I am pain and sorrow i am death and life without those things in my life i would not be the man i am today.<br>  <br>  Now if its a image of me but with a blank mind and a brain that does not remember the sorrows i experienced in life then i do not want to go. i would rather miss the things i had then have them washed away and forget the ones i loved.|`|tpDICzslaa	There are various Christian opinions about this. The Catholic view is that if you are not fit for heaven, there are two other possibilities.<br>  <br>  If you die in a state of unrepented mortal sin, having rejected God in a very clear and deliberate way, then God will accordingly reject you. That is hell - total and eternal separation from God, in which you no longer have his help or defence against the powers of evil.<br>  <br>  If you die in a state of lesser (venial) sin, or as someone who, through no fault of their own, never knew God, then you may end up in Purgatory. This is a temporary state, where those who have been saved but are not yet fit for heaven undergo whatever purification they require. This will not be an easy or pain free process, but unlike in hell, the suffering serves a purpose and is made bearable by the knowledge that you will eventually enter heaven.|`|6lJuKKMHaa	Do you have God's "Sealed Pardon" in you??

Then Jesus will turn to those on His left hand and say, "Depart from me because I was hungry and you did not feed me, I was thirsty and you did not give me to drink, I was sick and you did not visit me." These will ask Him, "When did we see You hungry, or thirsty or sick and did not come to Your help?"

Start going out during the daylight and get that knife away from your wrist.|`|dFBccLExaa	Reading is the best place to start. While witchcraft =/= Wicca, the two tend to play nice together, so don't be afraid of picking up Wiccan books, you might be surprised what you find. Once you've learned how magick works, and what it's capable of, you'd be able to put what you've learned into practice. Just rememeber that learning to perform the craft properly takes time, and you don't want to rush it. <br>  And as Crystal Clear said, you want to also look into what you expect to gain from witchcraft, and why you want to use it. These things are very important in your growth and learning. <br>  You can email me if you have any questions.|`|iByMZH4waa	Read everything you can find on the topic. Many books about Wicca also have information on witchcraft. Some of my favorite books are: <br>  Earth Power - Scott Cunningham<br>  Earth, Air, Fire, Water - Scott Cunningham<br>  Buckland's Complete Book of Witchcraft - Raymond Buckland<br>  Meditation is also a very useful practice in witchcraft.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Are you talking about witchcraft or Wicca?  Wicca is a modern day religion based on the folklore of (mostly) European origin, and primarily of Celtic origin.  (Yes, I know, there are about a thousand people who are ready to argue with me on this point. Please notice I said "mostly and primarily.")  <br>  <br>  Wicca uses rituals and spells that are morally directed by the threefold law: that what you do will come back to you three times (so don't go around cursing people).  The one thing that most Wiccans don't use is the Bible.  Though, even here, I've met at least one ritualistic Christian who hung out with Pagans because he found them less antagonistic to his beliefs.  <br>  <br>  Witchcraft is sometimes claimed by people who have grown up in families that have preserved spellcasting, divination, and herbal formulas in a continuous line passed down from generation to generation.  They often live in England and have names that are similar to the "witches" that were put to death there.  They may or may not have moral rules controlling their behavior, depending on the family.  Some witches use the Bible in their beliefs, others do not. <br>  <br>  There is a huge variety of witches and Wiccans in the world and they each have their own ideas about all of this, so it's very hard to talk about without somebody saying "that's not what *I* do!"  So keep in mind that it's hard to answer a question like this.  <br>  <br>  You can either start by joining a large organization like Covenant of the Goddess, or Church of All Worlds, or you can stay solitary and develop your ideas on your own.  A good book for that is written by Scott Cunningham.  <br>  <br>  The first question you need to ask yourself is, what do you believe in?  If not Jesus Christ and God as per the Bible, then what?  Try to find a deity that you respect and that you really believe in.  Otherwise, when things get rough (like you get hurt in a car accident, or you go through a divorce), you'll just go back to saying "Hail Mary's" because they're more comforting than your new religion.  <br>  <br>  Keep in mind that there is a Marian Cult that is approved of by the Pope and that many women find is satisfying.  Look for the Letters of the Popes online and you'll find that Mary is venerated very much in Christian doctrine.  So make sure you're not really looking for more ways to honor Mary when you make this jump away from Christianity.  <br>  <br>  Once you've discovered your deity (whoever it is, or they are), just do things at least weekly to respect and honor them.  But if you're young, keep in mind that your parents will not be pleased if you burn candles in the house.  So find some other things you like - perhaps a Fireplace DVD playing on your TV in the bedroom?  Or a decorative lamp you only use during ritual?<br>  <br>  The important thing in religion is to have a moral idea, and to develop a respect for yourself and others through it.  The rituals, spells, whatever, are there to give you emotional lifts.  That's very important.  Few things in life can give you the emotional support of a religion.  <br>  <br>  For starters, use a journal to record your thoughts and re-read it as you write in it.  You'll discover what your emotional and spiritual needs are soon enough this way.<br>  <br>  Please note:  Wiccans do not charge for their services.  Although even this is now changing.  It used to be a tenet of Wicca.<br>  <br>  Update: I noticed that people have a negative reaction to the suggestion that you look up Satanism.  Actually one of the most illuminating things I did was take a romp through Satanist websites.  People will always accuse you of it, so at least have an idea of what they're talking about.  Satanism I think is about removing the limitations to personal power.  I don't agree with everything they say, but hey whatever floats your boat!|`|SDDgbtQ4aa	The teacher in me would first ask you - what do you think/believe witchcraft is?

Start with simple basics, there are things you already do that can help you learn to apply energy to your work.  <br>  <br>  Herbalism, while it does require study, is simple and there is plenty of good info out there, (keep in mind, just because something is all natural doesn't mean it is safe.)  Learn to use teas to help clear the mind, Celestial Seasonings Sleepy Time Tea, is the exact recipe for a dream spell that I have, the tea is a booster it will not work on it's own, but it helps.  <br>  <br>  Cleaning the home you live in also is a great way to learn to focus your energy.  It applies your own power to the process of removing what you don't want there, this will help you in the future when you need to purify ritual space.    <br>  <br>  Not all magic is religious oriented, but if that is a path you wish to go down, you will have a lot more homework to do, and it's not all just reading, you will have reports to write.<br>  <br>  Dance to the rhythm of Fire|`|MbE0iwyXaa	It is great that you want to explore your spirituality.There are some sources that are  better than others in explaining wicca.Good books to start are Scott Cunningham and Silver Raven Wolf; "Solitary Witch."

mqV9TOv0aa	I found this for you...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ask.com/bar?q=Why+does+Shiva+hold+the+deer+and+fire&page=1&qsrc=0&zoom=What+Does+Shiva+Hold+in+His+Hands%7C&ab=8&u=http%3A%2F%2Frkmission-halli.org%2FFeb06-Release%2Fcelebs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ask.com/bar?q=Why+does+Shiva+...</a><br>  <br>  (((Being angered by Siva whose extrordinary beauty had attracted their wives, the Rsis of darukavana tried to kill him through sorcerous rituals. Out of the sacrificial fire rose a tiger, deer and a red-hot iron. Siva killed the tiger and wore its skin, caught hold of the deer with its left hand(which has remained there ever since)and made the iron one of his weapons.)))<br>  <br>  <br>  Shiva is the last deity of the Trinity. He is responsible for the dissolution of the universe. He is the embodiment of Tamas, the centrifugal intertia, the tendency towards dispersion and annihilation.<br>  Literrally, Shiva is one in whom the unvierse "sleeps" after destuction and before the next cycle of creation.<br>  All that is born, must die. All that is produced, must disintegrate and be destroyed. This is an inviolable law. The principle that brings about this disintegration, the power behind this destruction, is Siva.<br>  Siva is much more than that. Disintegration of the Universe ends in the ultimate thinning out, into a boundless void. This boundless void, the substratum of all existence, from which springs out again and again this apparently limitless universe, is Siva. So though Siva is described as responsible for destruction, he is equally responsible for creation and existence. In this sense, Brahma and Visnu are also Siva. It is perhaps this identity that is revealed by some of the stories in the Puranas. If one story makes Siva speak from the womb of the infinite pillar of fire Brahma and Visnu that they are his own aspects, other stories make Siva as being born from the brows of an angry Visnu or from Brahma who was intensely desiring to beget a son.<br>  <br>   <br>  Though Siva is often called Rudra, especially in his terrific aspect, whether the two are identical or not has been a subject of discussion and even controversy. Many scholars are inclined to think that the Rudra of the Vedas and the Siva of the Puranas and Agamas are two different deities fused into one at a later date as cultural integration ofthe two races accepting them progressed. According to these scholars Siva the pacific deity is a non-Aryan God, 'more ancient' than the Vedic Rudra. Though the 'Aryan conquerors' despised and derided the Saivas and their Siva(apparently because of some of their mysterious rituals and practices) as the two races had to live together; rapproachment and consequent cultural reconciliation became inevitable.<br>  Whatever may be the truth of these statements they are irrelevant to our study here, since we are more interested in discovering the significance of the symbology concerned, to enrich our lives.<br>  Siva is worshipped both in the anthropomorphic aspect and as the linga, the latter being the rule whereas the former is an exception. The most common of his pictures and images show him as a very handsome youth, white as camphor. His limbs besmeared with ashes are strong and smooth. He has three eyes-the third eye being on the forehead between the eyebrows-and four arms, two of the arms holding the Trisula(trident) and Damaru(drum) while the other two are in the Abhaya(protection-giving) and Varada(boon-giving)and Mudras(Poses). He has a crown of long matted hair from which flows the river Ganga. He also wears the crescent moon as a diadem. A tiger-skin and an elephant-skin adorn his body forming the necklace, the griddle, the Yajnopavita(sacred thread) as also arm-bracelets. There is also a garland of skulls round his blue neck.<br>  Man, being what he is, cannot help super imposing his own states on his gods too! Therefore it is but natural for him to concieve of Siva as a man with family. Parvati is his consort. Ganesa and Subramanya are his sons. Then there is the large retinue forming a veritable zoo as it were! Nandi his vehicle bull, Bhringi the Rsi, with three legs and three arms, the mouse of Ganesa, the peacock of Kumara as also a host of ghosts,goblins and imps constantly capering round him-form his large retinue.<br>  Though he has his head quarters in the icy mountains, the Himalayas, he is fond of roaming the earth, especially the burial grounds and cremation sites. All this in perfect consonance with his nature as the lord of destruction and dissolution.<br>  Before embarking upon the explanation of all this, which is obviously symbolical, it is better to summarise first the various stories about Siva recounted in our mythological literature.<br>  1. Once Parvati, in a playful mood. closed his two eyes, and lo! the entire world plunged in darkness. To save the worlds from this predicament, Siva willed a third eye in between his eyebrows, sending forth light, fire and heat. Later on, he opened this third eye-normally kept closed out of infinite mercy for humanity- to burn up Kamadeva, the Lord of lust.<br>  2.

YUAegpPoaa	If I answer did I choose to apply the label to myself to begin with? I thought almost everyone thought of themselves as 'the middle' and fairly representative of their groupings (actually as above the norm in a positive way but I wander from your point). <br>  <br>  Isn't moderate just the label you choose to apply to someone in an opposing group that has the opinion closest to your own?<br>  <br>  I think perspective is from where you stand and labels, even self-selected ones, are as often wrong as not.<br>  <br>  Personally, if the smile is genuine you/they can literally call me almost anything.|`|fbdad2836b12a55aac5a35bcb551f09caa	Actually, I love being a moderate. I'm a Liberal Fundamentalist Christian, which is an enigma in itself, so it brings me to a balance between both sides of the pendulum.<br>  <br>  What being a moderate means to me, is that I have the ability to listen to both sides, see the value of both viewpoints and formulate a decision based on seeing more than one side. It allows me the ability to walk the mile in the moccasins of another person.<br>  <br>  So, I love being a moderate!!|`|pfNnuD5saa	I am moderate to liberal in my politics too. I don't have a problem with it. It's a fact. I am a moderate to liberal Christian.|`|SbN2cXE5aa	Sorry, but I have never heard that term applied to Christians.

The problem comes with action|`|7f65e028a9299be65138de1d8d61b165aa	Wow i never really thought about those things.  i accept the moderate label because i know what people usually mean by it - a Christian who accepts evolution, doesn't hate homosexuals, all that.  Most of the moderates I know call themselves "real Christians."  i don't want to say fundamentalists are wrong (but they are).<br>  <br>  i guess it's like there are good cops and cops that harrass the public.  you could call this second group extremist but it doesn't mean that police work is inherently evil.|`|jkW2b55Qaa	It's a good point.  How many 'liberal' muslims or evangelicals do you hear about?  <br>  <br>  When a group is so hateful and reactionary that you have to distinguish those of the group who aren't that way by calling them 'moderate' (essentially, not like the others), you know your group has problems.|`|AA11579650	its something you adapt to shall i say? apprently being just Muslim isn't good enough. but really, i doesn't bother me as long as ppl realize that i am peaceful not "extremists" and if i gotta stick a moderate in front of it, who cares.|`|0WB5Tru5aa	Strange.

NwXnzARwaa	If California were to only recognize Domestic Partnerships, previous opposite-sex marriages would still be recognized by other states since not doing so would be unenforceable because they violate Article I, Section 9, Clause 3, and Section 10, Clause 1, of the U.S. Constitution (known as an Ex Post Facto law).<br>  <br>  Future opposite-sex Domestic Partnerships that would have been classified as a marriage would likely not be recognized by the US federal government due to the numerous laws that use the word marriage. They would also not be recognized by the other states due to the Defense of Marriage Act that does not require states to abide by the Full Faith and Credit clause of the US Constitution (Article IV, Section 1) in regards to marriage and the several recent state constitutional amendments that say that those states will only recognize marriage and not anything similar to a marriage. <br>  <br>  An opposite-sex couple would likely have to get married in a state that has marriage in order for that marriage to be recognized federally and by the other states.|`|FnCvyXVDaa	I'm not sure but I wouldn't think you would have to.

Their family sounds exactly like my family, and we are upper middle class, but not rich.|`|coPtU10Laa	Why do they need the granite. It will raise the resale value of their home but if they mostly eat out they won't really get much use out of them. They sound like the upper middle class at the very least but not necessarily wealthy. Question is why do you feel they need to tell them how to invest their money. Sounds like you have different priorities than they do and you allow them to decide how to best please their own wants and desires.|`|6jrv0MWTaa	I'm confused, what's the question? <br>  No the don't sound rich, they sound standard middle class.<br>  <br>  You don't convince them of anything, if they can afford all this they're doing something right.
zjzfWaGXaa	I don't see where you did anything wrong. You felt betrayed and you turned to a friend for comfort, this sounds like perfectly normal and healthy behavior. If you didn't cheat then she doesn't have any right to be angry, especially after what she did to you. <br>  <br>  The answer to the main question is Yes but it takes time and effort. She is going to have to prove to you that she can make it the distance and you are going to have to work to be able to trust her again. It seems like everyone these days thinks things either take longer than they should or should be an instant fix but this is one of those things where you just have to slowly work into a regular routine and eventually you will find that you are just as much in love and trusting as you ever were. Also DO NOT let her MAKE YOU feel guilty when you haven't done anything wrong. There is absolutely nothing wrong with having a friend and confidant with whom you are not romantically involved. Remember that she has to prove herself to you, not the other way around. She needs to feel all the hurt she has caused you and your daughter and she needs to be made to understand that it is unacceptable and will not be tolerated. You need to tell her how it is going to be and you need to be prepared to remove her from your life if she starts slipping. <br>  <br>  If you can't stand losing her again, don't get back involved because it could come to that.|`|2f0137f09289e62bcaf3e3903473e994aa	wow. dump her. shell do it again. she gave a way your freakin dog. what a selfish *****. find someone much better. please don't waist all your energy on theis piece of ****.|`|mr4pB3xFaa	if you know whats best for you, you would stay away from her even though how much you care for her, if sshe doesn't make you happy, and forgive you for what you've forgiven her for.<br>  <br>  she's not worth it.<br>  i mean think of it, she's done more stuff than you have done to her, and yet you still forgive her and have a relationship with her, does that sound right?<br>  she's gonna get close to you again, and just continue to do this, i would say leave her, and don't trust her.<br>  at all.<br>  <br>  if she really cared about you, she wouldn't steal from you in the first place.|`|lQmGDPIoaa	Are you a bisexual.

Death row executions are well known but not an every day event.<br>  Tommiecat is not correct that it was used only on "Jewish criminals". It was almost never used on Jews. But, it was also never used on Roman citizens. Remember, there were many nationalities all through the Roman empire at the time.<br>  <br>  It was essentially a criminal's execution that was meted out to a religious leader. The fact of his crucifixion is not the basis of the popularity of Christianity, but rather it's message and vigorous spread by followers.<br>  The crucifixion no doubt helped this popularity by being a violent and "high profile" execution.|`|ouXrNitMaa	Wow that's like saying something along the lines of "Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated for his beliefs and others were too, so what made the way he was killed so special?"<br>  <br>  And here we are, with a half-black PRESIDENT. I'd say the significance of their CAUSE is the point, not how they were killed by the people who feared to lose their control.|`|ORFXYTj6aa	Jesus was the only one that rose from the dead after being crucified.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Placing significance on his crucifixion makes all the others who died on a cross seem insignificant. I think that's wrong. It was just as painful for all the others. And Jesus (not his real name anyway, just the bastardized english version of his name - which he probably wouldn't respond to anyway) did not die for anyone, he died because the romans killed him. They made a massive religion out of it because some jews who followed his teachings got bored with their religion and thought it would better suit them to start their own where they could bend the rules to their own whims. I mean, isn't that what all religions do anyway? Tweak it to interpret it the way they see fit?

Lewis says, because Jesus claimed (and demonstrated) that He is God in the flesh, you must either call Him crazy, a liar or Lord.  There are no other choices.   A "good or "holy" man would not claim to be God if it wasn't true. Since Jesus did on many occasions, He can't be good if it was a lie.  So which one do you say He is?|`|t88527U1aa	Well fulfilling every Prophecy about him many out of his control,then reappearing to more than 500 people after death might have had something to do with it.

Romans only used it on Jewish criminals. They did not use it on there own citizens. After Jesus was crucified they tried to cover up that they ever did it. But recently it has been found that they did use it. The Jews hated it. Pontius Pilate did not charge him with any crime. So why did the Jews demand that Jesus be crucified when they hated the punishment|`|A5UbjXI4aa	The religion isn't about the crucifixion. Jesus was the Son of God and He came down from Heaven to die on the cross for our sins so we too could go up and be with Him when we died.

The Bible never says any of what you said. Guess that is why there are no quotes or citations, huh.<br>  <br>  Just a couple points because I'm serious, you should read at least the Gospels once. <br>  <br>  1) It is His whole life that is significant. He was 30 you know (!) when He started preaching. 10 times as much of His Life was spent NOT PREACHING!! -- Look it up.<br>  <br>  2) The Church is based on the Resurrection. You should read some of St Paul too. THIS is the basis :<br>  "And if Christ be not risen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is also vain"<br>  <br>  Finally, as the Prophecy of the Destruction of Jerusalem shows, it was the rejection of Him as the Son of God sent by the Father that brought down destruction. <br>  <br>  Yes, the Crucifixion was important but if you really don't know the above, what is the use giving you Baby Catechism lessons :)|`|AA11598520	Because unlike all the others, he rose from the dead of his own accord three days later. He couldn't have risen from the dead if he hadn't been killed in the first place. THAT'S why is crucifixion was so much more significant. The ONLY reason that Jesus' crucifixion was significant is because it provided the avenue for Jesus to rise from the dead through his own divine power. That's why Christianity exists and the churches were built, not because of the way he died but because he rose again all by himself.<br>  <br>  Gosh, thanks. When I was a teenager, I used to get very wrapped up in the sorrow of Good Friday and found that I would get so depression over what was done to Jesus that I'd miss the point--Easter and the resurrection.

They believe that everything past that is a false chain of events created by someone else (though she couldn't explain who...).  They believe in the same God that Christians do...but they don't believe that Jesus was the "chosen one"...he hasn't come along yet, I guess.<br>  <br>  She told me this about 10 years ago, so I hope I didn't mix anything up.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Lee, I really don't understand your questions.<br>  <br>  For one thing, Jesus built his church during his life.  He had to hand the obvious decisions over to Peter after he resurrected himself, though he still led the church through revelation.  No revelation?  No Christian church.  <br>  <br>  Next, Jews didn't have to kill anybody in order to believe.  Some of them believe all of the prophets up to Malachi (any further and they'd have become Christians, Moslems, or Latter-day Saint Christians).  Some of them simply define Moses as the greatest prophet of all time so they can comfortably ignore all of the other prophets after him.  Some are skeptics and take all the old scriptures with a grain of salt.

Lethal, in fact.<br>  <br>  What we can refer to as ‘classical’ anti semitism is predicated on the notion that the Jews killed the ’son of god’. Until recently, the Christian charge of ‘deicide’ against the Jews stood.<br>  <br>  But to anyone who understands the situation back when Jesus lived, the idea that the Jews killed him is foolish beyond belief. And here’s why:<br>  <br>  1 - Crucifixion has always been forbidden to Jews, precisely because it is such a cruel method of killing a person. It was a purely Roman method of execution.<br>  <br>  2 - The Jews were a despised minority, with no power to request, let alone ‘demand’ a man’s death. They were entirely at the mercy of the Romans and to suggest that the Jewish leaders ‘pressured’ the Romans over anything is, frankly, risible.<br>  <br>  3 - Pilot was renowned for being a ruthless and violent leader. He didn’t take orders from the Jews, that’s for sure. Simply put: if Pilot had wanted to free Jesus, he *would* have, and that’s all there is to it.<br>  <br>  4 - Even in the Christian bible, the Jews are referred to as being overly ‘legalistic’ and ‘pedantic’. The overturning of their many ‘laws’ was the aim of Christianity! Yet Christianity would also have us believe that the Jews ignored all of their own rules in order to hand Jesus over. Well, which is it? The Christian scriptures blatantly contradict themselves on this issue.<br>  <br>  5 - Jesus was one of many, many young Jewish preachers in Judea at that time. He was not unique. And he taught basic Judaism. ‘Love thy neighbour’ appeared first in the Torah, written *thousands* of years before Jesus was even a glint in Joseph’s eye. The Jews had no problem with Jesus. Sure, he sought to reform some aspects of the religion, but so what?<br>  <br>  That, again, was not uncommon. Judaism has always cherished debate and discussion. And Jesus, with his tiny following, was certainly no threat to Judaism as a whole.<br>  <br>  But the Romans did view Jesus as a threat. For one thing, he had this unfortunate habit of calling himself ‘the most powerful man in the Roman Empire’. Such a statement was not going to be tolerated. The Romans also viewed Jesus as a political rebel. It’s worth noting that there were various other Jewish men claiming to be the ‘maschiach’ and most of them were also crucified by the Romans!<br>  <br>  The Romans crucified some 250,000 Jews, in total.<br>  <br>  6 Jesus was charged with sedition; this was a crime against Rome and nothing to do with Judaism.<br>  <br>  In short,The absurd myth that the Jews killed Jesus has no basis in fact. It never did have. Two Popes have publicly apologised to the Jews for the unfair accusation.<br>  <br>  Joseph C. Hough, a Christian theologian, writing in the June 2002 issue of Bible Review, states: “By the end of the second century, anti-Judaism and the ‘Christ-killer’ **myth** had become prominent in the teachings of Church leaders. The early church fathers perpetuated this with even greater vehemence than John did in his gospel.<br>  <br>  “By the fourth century, Augustine and John Chrysostom were among those who gave credence to the awful depiction of Jews as the enemies of G-d who crucified Christ. The power of the ‘Christ-killer’ **myth created a cultural climate in which hatred and killing of Jews occurred with impunity. What emerged was a relentless and continuing persecution of Jews . . .”<br>  <br>  REFERENCES:<br>  <br>  Crossan, John Dominic, Who Killed Jesus?

NY, Bloch Publishing Company, 1964.<br>  <br>  Longer Answer:<br>  <br>  The Christian scriptures would have us believe that in order to get rid of Jesus, the Jews were happy to violate an entire series of religious laws:<br>  <br>  1. First, the NT says that the trial was on a Friday, and that on the night before, Jesus celebrated the Passover meal with his disciples. That would mean that his trial was on the first day of Passover.<br>  <br>  Here is a violation of two legal principles — his trial was not on a Thursday or Monday as required, and it was on a holiday when no trials whatsoever could be held.<br>  <br>  2. There were no witnesses of a warning to Jesus and no witnesses of his actual crime. The NT account of his trial shows that he was convicted on his own testimony. This is a severe violation of the Torah.<br>  <br>  3. There is no account in the NT of any call for defense witnesses.<br>  <br>  4. The choice of execution method violates Torah completely. If convicted for Sabbath violation or false prophecy, the appropriate punishment was stoning.<br>  <br>  5. If the trial and execution were indeed held on Friday, there are several problems, including li including limited time for a trial, and limited time for the execution. A crucifixion on a Friday afternoon was certain to run over through Shabbat and then later. Assuming that the 120 judges of the Sanhedrin would have permitted a crucifixion (which is unlikely), one would doubt that they would have risked having Jesus die on the cross after the Sabbath began Friday night. Because of the Sabbath laws, they would have been unable to carry the corpse to a burial site, and leaving the corpse on the cross overnight would be a Torah violation.<br>  <br>  6. Finally,there is no record teaching that the court of that era was known to be reckless with the use of the death penalty. Yet, not only was Jesus crucified, but so were two petty criminals, according to the NT, and their crimes did not even justify the death penalty.<br>  <br>  Relevant info on the Jewish legal system in effect during the Second Temple:<br>  <br>  *No trials of any kind were held on any day but Mondays and Thursdays, which were market days and ensured the highest chance that witnesses could be found and available. (In addition, it was believed that those are the days when G-d’s holy court was in session.) Furthermore, no trial could be held on a Jewish festival such as the first or last day of Passover. Source: Talmud tractate Moed Katan 16a.<br>  <br>  * Jewish law requires (then and now) that a person accused of a capital crime be convicted only if (a) two valid witnesses come forward and testify that the accused was warned that doing X would result in the death penalty; and (b) two valid witnesses testified that after the warning, the accused violated the law anyway. A false witness was liable to the same punishment as would have been given to the accused — hence a strong deterrent against perjury. Moreover, a defendant could not be convicted on his own testimony. These are fundamental principles you’ll find in the Torah itself. E.g. Deut. 16:6<br>  <br>  * When one stands accused of a capital crime, a towncryer was to go out through the community and announce that so-and-so was accused of such and such and is being tried at such and such time. In addition, the towncryer was to also announce that any witnesses favorable to the defendant should step forward to the Sanhedrin. This was not a short process and could not be done in a single day. Source: Talmud tractate Sanhedrin.<br>  <br>  *Execution was only permitted by four methods under Torah law: stoning, burning, beheading and strangulation. These are the words used in the translation, but the Talmud explains that “burning” required that the convicted felon drink a liquid metal that would kill him immediately, and that beheading did not mean literally to remove the head, but merely severage of the windpipe and the artery to the brain, resulting in immediate death also. The Talmud taught that these methods were all designed to limit disfigurement of the body and result in rapid death with limited pain. Source Talmud tractate Sanhedrin, among other places. In tractate Yevamos 120b there is discussion of crucifixion as a strictly Roman practice. Furthermore, it was taught that if a person testified (on behalf of a widow seeking proof of her husband’s death) that so and so was crucified, but he did not actually see the body after death, then there is no proof of death as people had been known to survive cruicifixion.<br>  <br>  * The Torah strictly prohibits a body of an executed criminal from being hung out for view past nightfall. Deut. 21:22-24. Furthermore, it would be prohibited to transport a body through a public area to a private area (such as a cave) on the Sabbath. Talmud Tractate Shabbos.<br>  <br>  * The death penalty was carried out rarely in Israel. According to Rabbi Elazar ben Azariah, if an execution occurred more than once in seventy years, that court would be considered “murderous tribunal.” Mishna Makkos 1:10. Besides the issue of a stigma on the court, executions were rare because of the high standards of evidence required for a conviction. To put this in context, Texas, this year alone, executed 40 prisoners.<br>  <br>  Key point:<br>  <br>  The Christian scriptures themselves remark that during this period, the Jews were excessively ‘legalistic’; that is, they were obsessive in their adherence to the Jewish religious laws.<br>  <br>  Yet the same scriptures would also have us believe that the Jews cheerfully violated an entire series of religious rules, purely in order to dispose of Jesus!<br>  <br>  Clearly this is an utter contradiction.<br>  <br>  Philo, who was Pilate’s contemporary, wrote an appeal to the emperor Caligula that included a description of Pilate. Philo wrote of “the briberies, the insults, the robberies, the outrages and wanton injustices, the executions without trial constantly repeated, the endless and supremely grievous cruelty” of Pilate’s rule. Pilate was eventually dismissed from office because of complaints of his widespread and inju|`|mefwTmwQaa	We the Jews did NOT kill Jesus the Romans did being that was their method of execution..From what I read in the NT Jesus was ordained to die as a sacrifice for what later became Christianity..Assuming you're a Christian you should know that.

Osiris.<br>  <br>  The complicated answer? Both and neither.<br>  <br>  Osiris, in terms of written accounts, appeared in religious mythology before Jehova. However, I have found through personal research... and a little common sense, really... that most religions go back to Sumerian mythology. So honestly... neither Osiris nor Jehova would exist as we know them today, but both may be present within Sumerian mythology. Therefor, they could be about the same age or could even be the same entity under different names.<br>  <br>  I really suggest people look up the Sumerian mythology and take a look. :] It's fascinating.|`|XtVCFIXmaa	Yahweh, or jehovah, is infinite, he was there from the beginning of time.

He has no beginning nor will he have an end.|`|VYLEfiSTaa	Jehovah is the only true God.....“Before me no god was formed, nor shall there be any after me.” (Isa. 43:10) More is also read into this text than it warrants by those who use it to prove that Jesus Christ is equal with God. The claim is made that this text proves that Jesus could not have been created by God but must have existed from eternity, otherwise he would have been a god that came after God, and God says that there shall be no god after him. Such an argument, however, shows a misunderstanding of the text. The point Jehovah is here making is that he had no predecessors, before him no god existed. How could there be a god before him, since he always was? Neither will there be any god after him, that is, he will never have any successors, because he will always be the Supreme Sovereign, Jehovah God. That God Jehovah did produce other gods, the Scriptures show: “I say, ‘You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, you shall die like men, and fall like any prince.’” So also the Logos was a god created by Jehovah.—Ps. 82:6, 7.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Osiris was the most popular of the Egyptian gods and was regarded as the son of the earth-god Geb and the sky-goddess Nut. It was said that Osiris became the husband of Isis and reigned as king over Egypt. The mythological accounts tell of Osiris’ being murdered by his brother Set and then being restored to life, becoming the judge and king of the dead. The relationship of Osiris and Isis and their respective characteristics strikingly correspond to the relationship and characteristics of the Babylonian Tammuz and Ishtar. Hence, numerous scholars consider them to be identical.<br>  <br>  Mother-and-son worship was also very popular in Egypt. Isis is often portrayed with the infant Horus on her knees. This representation is so much like that of the Madonna and child that certain ones in Christendom have at times venerated it in ignorance. (PICTURE, Vol. 2, p. 529) With respect to the god Horus, there is evidence of the distortion of the Edenic promise concerning the seed that would bruise the serpent in the head. (Ge 3:15) At times Horus is depicted as trampling crocodiles and grasping snakes and scorpions. According to one account, when Horus proceeded to avenge the death of his father Osiris, Set, who had murdered Osiris, changed himself into a serpent.<br>  <br>  On Egyptian sculptures and paintings the sacred symbol, the crux ansata, occurs very frequently. This so-called sign of life looks like the letter “T” with an oval handle on top and probably represented the male and female organs of reproduction combined. The Egyptian deities are often depicted as holding the crux ansata|`|GeoiGjbCaa	The FSM created both of them one day when the electricity went out and he couldn't watch tv.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	osiris is fake|`|4qA9Y7m9aa	Osiris by a few thousand years

GBKaftrJaa	The Lord's prayer is an example Jesus gave us as to how we ought to pray when we pray.  It involves addressing God as our Father, speaking of his holiness, and your wish that his ways are what happens, asking for your needs to be met, asking for your sins to be forgiven, remembering to forgive others, and praising God.<br>  <br>  And if you as a child pray and are baptized but later as an adult reject  Jesus and his salvation then no, you wouldn't be saved.  It's not like a vaccination where you get it once and you are protected in the future.  God desires us to have an ongoing relationship with him.<br>  <br>  So to accept Jesus and have that relationship with him, pray daily, read the bible daily, attend a worship service at a local church weekly, and try to live your life according to God's ways.|`|TMb076n6aa	No it goes something like this<br>  <br>   Lord Jesus, forgive me of my sins and come into my heart. I thank you for dying on the cross for my sins thank you for shedding your blood for me. I accept you into my heart. I ask that you fill me with your Holy Spirit Amen!|`|d9fb2acd20fb4c3590182dc9f4470d89aa	To accept Jesus, you need to simply receive Him by faith and welcome Him into your life, giving Him His proper place - as the Lord, who died for your sins, to buy you back from Satan and present you to God.<br>  I believe the Bible sets forth certain things we MUST believe about Jesus. Mainly, that He is truly God, not a created being - indeed John in his Gospel in the first few verses says plainly that Jesus before becoming a man was the One through whom all things were created.<br>  We need to believe He died for our sins, and that He was raised from the dead, and that He stands before God the Father now to intercede for everyone who seeks to come to God through Him.<br>  <br>  PLEASE- begin to read the Bible ! It is the Word of God, and when we receive it as such into our heart, this will bring the assurance of salvation. Read especially the New Testament  (starts with the Gospel of Matthew), and read some of it every day of your life, praying as you read, and God will bring you safely to His heavenly Kingdom.<br>  <br>  Consider just this one statement by Jesus:<br>  <br>  "Truly, truly, I (Jesus) say to you, he who hears My word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life."<br>  <br>  John 5:24 NASB|`|0Iin6kO4aa	amen|`|XkrHDiClaa	I'm sorry to say, and I don't mean it to be an offense... but you are mistaken in the process of being saved.<br>  <br>  Your accepting of Jesus is not done because of the prayer, only the Baptism.  First of all, you accept Jesus prior to being baptized.  Baptism is your public display of your belief.  The Lord's Prayer is a template of how we should pray to God - for those who don't understand how to do so.<br>  <br>  As you become an adult, you will be tested by Satan - just as everyone (including Jesus) was allowed to be.  Your salvation doesn't change, but your beliefs can cause you to miss out on what God has in store for you when your time comes.<br>  <br>  I've slipped up, just as anyone can, and spent year regretting my past actions in silent depression.  But I came back, studied, learned and understood so that I can help those who may be weavering.  I would suggest you find a medie (website, book, video) that can help you understand these practices.  God bless you in your journey, and I wish you the best.  Be careful of who you listen to on this page.|`|faceb0da83e7b433b86d3ae6836703f3aa	Well? The Lords prayer is a good prayer to learn. Jesus told us to pray this way.<br>  <br>  The Kingdom came on the Day of Pentecost.<br>  <br>  But we should confess with our mouth Jesus Christ our Lord while believing in our heart He raised from the dead.<br>  For with the mouth confession is made unto Salvation.<br>  And with the heart one believes unto Righteousness.<br>  <br>  As a child I prayed the sinners prayer. But really during praise & worship, prayed honestly from my heart to God in the praise song, 'Come into my heart. Come into my heart. Come into my heart Lord Jesus. Come in today. Come in to stay. Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.'.|`|Vw1REpBKaa	Saved from what? Is someone after me??|`|UL3XOKJxaa	The Lord's Prayer...or model prayer does not save anyone, nor does any prayer. Where in the bible is there any example of someone repeating or saying a prayer to be saved? The biblical model for salvation is found throughout the book of Acts, in fact there are 9 examples of people being saved and all follow the bible mode of salvation. Why not read it for yourself and come to your own conclusions...I will say this, every answer that you have received will get you someplace...but it is not heaven according to what the bible teaches. Check it out for yourself, your soul depends on it. God BLess|`|iblT1HJpaa	For one - "chris" is a dunderhead about apostasy. All can lose their salvation when once saved ofr Jesus said that the greatest sin is to blaspheme the Holy Spirit and none will be saved by it. <br>  <br>  For you - there is no "special" prayer.

dOXUYv0Xaa	If one wishes to know the answer to this question, one must ask Jesus (PBUH).<br>  <br>  First of all this question is possibly the root cause of all religious conflict.<br>  We all know that much time has passed since the physical presence of God's Prophet Jesus, Isa (PBUH) occurred.<br>  To this very day the question remains: Who exactly said what?<br>  Over time verbal communication can become distorted and this is highly possible, is it not so?<br>  <br>  It is documented that Jesus (PBUH) said that he was the Son 'Sun' of Man, many times.<br>  It is not documented that Jesus (PBUH) claimed to be the Son 'Sun' of God.<br>  The truth of that which has been spoken of in the past should be left up to the discretion of each human being and each human being must decide for them-self of its validity or credibility.<br>  <br>  There is a 'Sun' that dwells within all human beings.<br>  It is a ray of divine light.<br>  This 'Sun' is the Soul.<br>  It is the connection between all those that have been graced with the human form, and their Creator. It is the one common thread within humanity.<br>  Some have faith in its presence and some have no faith in its presence.<br>  ~~~~~<br>  This is my humble understanding of God's Prophet Jesus, Isa (PBUH).<br>  <br>  La ilaha illa Allah 'Isa Ruh Allah. - arabic translation<br>  There is no god other than Allah, and Jesus is the soul of Allah. - english translation<br>  <br>  Jesus is the Over-soul within all those known as human beings.<br>  That is the presence that binds the "family of man".<br>  Thus: The Son 'sun' of Man. <br>  This presence within mankind was initiated from the very beginning.<br>  <br>  Eventually this is what man must know through wisdom, silently observe, and through clarity come to understand.<br>  <br>  I hope this sheds some light on this marvelous question.<br>  May the Peace and Blessings of that "One God" be with us all.<br>  <br>  *footnote - If I have spoken anything in error, this small child asks for God's forgiveness.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	When he called himself the son of man in the King James Bible, he was (in the Reina-Valera Spanish Bible) calling himself The Son of The Man, or the son of God.  Everything that Jesus did and said underscored his claim to being the son of God.<br>  <br>  Not God.|`|hl4kkvXhaa	OK...basically, it's the same way Christians think on this.  In essence, we are all the "children of God" meaning we are his creation.  But, at the same time, we are "borne of man", meaning that we are born to humans.  <br>  <br>  God is basically the spiritual parent, but man is the physical being that makes us flesh and bone.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps a bit!|`|6b24cf642defa808f4e13cc745076453aa	Confusion?

"Son of (the) Man".<br>  <br>  The Hebrews would have no doubt that Jesus, applying this term to himself,  was most certainly declaring himself to be none other than the promised Messiah.<br>  <br>  But the Jews (or the gentiles, for that matter) would probably not have expected the Messiah to also be the Son of God, since that detail wasn't clearly defined, according to their limited understanding of the OT scriptures, which described God as "one".<br>  <br>  Jesus personally set that matter straight when he  described himself as the Son of God ... and that was enough to get him crucified ... perfectly fulfilling God's salvific plan.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/a-short-course-on-the-peculiar-theology-of-redemption/" rel="nofollow">http://douglawrence.wordpress.com/a-shor...</a>|`|6ypnDnvLaa	I interpret it to mean: he was both fully God and man.  <br>  He came to pay our price; bridging the gap between us and God.<br>  <a href="http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=4038" rel="nofollow">http://www.bible.org/page.php?page_id=40...</a>|`|I0aosHnuaa	pure religious gobbledegook nonsense ... there is NO jesus ... there is NO god ... there is NO father xmas ... our parents made us.|`|21734fbffcbf8e21d21f99205c491e6daa	maybe by man, he meant son of Joseph (that's like his step dad or human dad)|`|8f1i9DWyaa	Jesus was both, Son of God, and Son of Man. We understand His divinity as Son of God. Now to understand why it is so important that Jesus' humanity be understood.<br>  Zoom back to Genesis: God gave Adam authority in the earth. Adam's authority over the earth realm extended to his descendents. Jesus had to be born as any other human being, born as a man, to obtain man's authority over the earth realm. That's why He had to be born of Mary, yet He was conceived by the Holy Spirit. So Jesus is was born as a human being; yet wrapped up in that humanity was the Son of God, a divine being who had pre-existence in a heavenly realm with His father, God.<br>  Once on earth, Jesus could take back the authority over the earth that Adam negligently, and inadvertantly, gave to satan. (that's why there's so much negative stuff going on in the earth)|`|Iw9C17Braa	The statement "son of man" most likely comes from the Aramaic phrase "bar enasha" which literally means "human". So this was not an uncommon thing for people to say at this time.<br>  <br>  As regards "Son of God", according to the bible:<br>  Jacob (Exodus 4:22),<br>  Solomon (Samuel 7:13-14),<br>  Ephriam (Jeremiah 31:9),<br>  Adam (Luke 3:38)<br>  were also the son of god.<br>  <br>  also see (Romans 8:14)<br>  <br>  If you bear these things in mind then it is not so strange or contradictory that he refered to himself as both|`|U2Tem402aa	The son of Man because he was the Son of a Mortal Woman and the Son of God because His father was that of God or more or less because of the will of God he was born without a Father and was the Lamb of God another one of his titles because of his Sacrifice at the Garden and on the Cross, <br>  <br>  Hope it helps|`|oGVvEl3Maa	dear sister...<br>  this thought comes to mind and my answer is in the form of a biblical quote...<br>  <br>  what it means is left up to the reader...<br>  Genesis 5:1-2<br>  <br>  "This is the book of the genealogy of Adam.

He created them male and female, and blessed them and called them Mankind in the day they were created."<br>  <br>  lots of love... and a hug too,<br>  sean|`|EOJpp4BBaa	Jesus was called the son of man for he was born of the virgin Mary, and lived with humans, and had interaction with humans. He was born a human, yet he was still a God. Since Jesus was modest, he would not go around and tell everyone he was son of God.|`|1fyZTtnVaa	The way i see it, when He calls Himself the Son of Man, He does so to show that He was born of man, meaning that He was human.<br>  <br>  And like you said, we all understand what He means when He says Son of God.|`|TzNdXVmPaa	Why do you naysayers even bother with these questions. Must not have anything better to do. Just going for points, huh? Lilith, you were already answered. Jesus was seeded in the virgin Mary's womb by GOD'S Holy Spirit. His birth was emmaculate , praise the LORD for us. He was human and divine.|`|SHtTPBieaa	Jesus never existed, a man named Yeshua Bar Joseph did.  Just as the name was corrupted so is his message.  Yeshua would tell you that we're all the Children of God and only by the accident of incarnation are we the sons of man.  This just happens to be the dominate species at the moment.  We are all divine and by our faith we create our world.  Faith is just that which we completely agree with, sometimes it's our fears as much as our hopes.  It is this power that brings hope and dread into all our lives.  The power is for each of us, but it is Truly a two edged sword.|`|CnEmETVfaa	OK...I hope this makes sense....  <br>  <br>  In the Bible, Jesus never referred to Himself verbally as "the Son of God."  He only referred to Himself verbally as "the Son of man."  <br>  <br>  Those of us who believe the Bible is the Living Word of God, also believe that Jesus was born of the virgin Mary, and God was Jesus' Father.  Therefore, we know that Jesus Christ was a human being (man), with the Father's Spirit (God).  <br>  <br>  Jesus wanted all who heard Him, and those who observed what He did during His 3 year ministry on earth, to have complete FAITH that the message He brought and the works that He performed, such as heeling the sick, raising the dead, and casting out demons, was the message and the works of His Father (God).<br>  <br>  OR....another way to explain is that in ancient times (BC), only the Jews believed in the one true living God.  So, God the Father, sent His Son, Jesus Christ, so that all who have FAITH that the message Jesus Christ brought, was the message of love, forgiveness and salvation, or everlasting life, from His Father (God) not only to and for the Jews, but for all of mankind.  Therefore, believers are referred to as "the children of God."  <br>  <br>  You too can become a child of God this very moment.  All you have to do is believe in Him.  Ask Him to come and live in your heart and you will have a new life as a believer in Jesus Christ.<br>  <br>  I'm going to stop there, but I hope that helps!!  GOD BLESS!!!|`|6lJuKKMHaa	He is the "First Born" to New Life Everlasting for ALL mankind 'if' they want Him.

TVJsOEKNaa	This actually has to do with English semantics. A suffix (ending) is an affix which is placed after the stem of a word. <br>  <br>  Common examples are case endings, which indicate the grammatical case of nouns or adjectives, and verb endings, which form the conjugation of verbs.<br>  <br>  the suffix -ish modifies the root-word clear changing its meaning to "clear, but not very clear". <br>  <br>  'Jew' can be treated as a pejorative depending on the context that it's used in. In your example you state: "Jew artists" but that is incorrect English grammar.  <br>  <br>  A Jew refers to one person, and Jews refer to many people, so regardless, your statement tries to use a singular combined with a plural word (this is a no-no in the English language).<br>  <br>  Pejoratives, are phrases that imply disapproval or contempt. When used as an adjective, pejorative is synonymous with derogatory, derisive, dyslogistic, and contemptuous. <br>  <br>  When used as a noun, pejorative means "a belittling or disparaging word or expression". Pejorative expressions are not inherently dyslogisms but may also be used in a non-pejorative way; however, determining the intent of the speaker is problematic, as with any implied meaning.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a term may begin as a pejorative word and eventually be adopted in a non-pejorative sense. <br>  <br>  This happened with the terms Big Bang, Quaker, Yankee, Okie, Tory and Whig, Ham radio operator, Methodist, Shaker, Unitarian and Sooner or Republican, which were originally slang insults but came to be used as non-pejorative standard words. In historical linguistics, this phenomenon is known as melioration, or amelioration.<br>  <br>  Sometimes a term is still considered as a pejorative word by some but not by others. In other cases, some groups have attempted to "reclaim" formerly offensive words applied against them, with limited success. <br>  <br>  In this case, it's a social faux pas because of the pejorative uses of the term both historically and presently. <br>  <br>  As far as Jews all being "Eastern European": What about the Jews living in Yemen, Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Persia etc.. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jews" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mizrahi_Jew...</a>|`|vUiUoamVaa	I think that is just how it is done - it desingates them.

In hebrew, we are yehudim. English constructs its genre labels independantly. Why are Islamists "muslim" and not Islamists. why aren't Buddhists Buddhaites?

Even in the dictionary that was how it was defined.<br>  <br>  Today of course, it's fine to use the word.

However, that's what made people think you were being racist.  Good guess on their part since a number of your quesitons are targeted at Jews with anti-Jewishism concepts.  I really hope though you are learning things new to you & starting to have new ideas...I noticed at least one question where you did seem to be geniunely interested in us.<br>  <br>  Jew WAS used as an anti-Jewish slur in Europe for centuries.  It's the noun, vs. adjective, & therefore stands out.  So when someone uses "Jew' incorrectly instead of the adjective "jewish" it's the way the term was used as a slur.  That's what's wrong with it.  <br>  <br>  To unbunggle when I'm saying.,,, "Jew artists"<br>  1. Uses the wrong part of speech, a noun where an adjective belongs.<br>  2. Uses it in a way that was classically used to express distain & hate at Jews & degrade them.  It was often used with "Jew boy".  It was -not- used when -not- degrading, so if you use it that way, that's what it represents.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped.<br>  <br>  ===================<br>  "Endgame: HAHAHAHA!!!"<br>  What kind of communication is that?????<br>  You make a comment attacking Jews - think you didn't -- and now think you got the answers you wanted.

You'll see some things you don't want to, some things you wish you'd never seen. But it's still usually pretty fun. <br>  <br>  I was down in Galveston on year for Mardi Gras parades along the seawall. Just looking at license plates, people came from as far away as Ontario to enjoy it.<br>  <br>  You're standing on Seawall Blvd, in 10 deg C weather, the wind blasting you off the Gulf, and by 9am, the beer booths are doing a lively buiness and the Canadians are shucked down to tank tops, drinking cold beer and flashing for beads. The Coast Guard was using propane cannons to shoot cups and beads into the crowd, the star pitcher from a baseball team was too trashed to hit the broadside of a coed with a string of beads, and Bo Diddley was on a float going by, playing jazz and throwing beads.<br>  <br>  Our pride parades can be a little,....interesting, for lack of a better term. Last time I was there, we had a guy in a nun's habit, carrying a pledge paddle with sign pronouncing him "The Nun For You." There was a Colonel Sanders look alike, with a chicken in a full body harness, the chicken was carrying a sign that said "Col. Sanders doesn't abuse me, I enjoy it." A Michael Jackson impersonator had an infant doll on a string so he could pretend to drop it and snatch it back to his hands. I avoided a club where there was a costume party going on and heard a judge say "Tell me those curtains don't match the drapes." There were faux Mormons, complete with short sleeved dress shirts and cycle helmets, the best of which had rolled an all-terrain tire through paint before rolling it across the back of his shirt.<br>  <br>  I could've done without the guys that looked like Homer Simpson in tutus and leotards, but it's been a very long time since I laughed that hard.

PeYiVoeoaa	Passing up the bread and wine may attributed to false teachings of the WBTS.<br>  The composite doctrines and implementation of those doctrines are quite easily seen by those on the outside as cult teaching and cult practices.<br>  The Watchtower does not teach as any Christian church so the dogma may not be considered Christian. Therefore the followers are not Christians.<br>  What is different that makes the WBTS non Christian? They do not teach the divinity and deity of Jesus Christ. Recognizing the divinity and deity of Jesus is and has been belief and faith of Christians for 2000 years.<br>  Without believing and having faith in Jesus as the Son of God , Immanuel God with us,  taking the bread and wine is of no value to a Jehovah's Witness.<br>  Members of the writing staff and Governing Body of the WTBS penned the variation the the bible that is used by the Jehovah's Witnesses. This removes the divinity and deity of Jesus our Lord and Savior and alters many other Christian concepts such as Grace.<br>  Grace,  believing upon Jesus, and being a member of the Christian Church is the reason to take communion.<br>  The Jehovah's Witnesses believe what the WTBS teaches them. This is belief and faith in a group of men that write articles and run a publishing corporation.<br>  The followers are baptized into the Organization. The followers have faith in the corporate of men that run the Organization who call themselves "The Faithful and Discrete Slave" and their teachings "The Truth".<br>  What is interesting is that no matter how many times it is pointed out to them the errors and fallacies the followers still think these men and their truth are the way to live..|`|yrJQHOOeaa	It seems the ways of the Jehovah Witness disturb you... If that is the case then you should find comfort in not sharing their beliefs.

I am wondering about their decision to not partake.  If I was hosting a feast and was happy to lay out a wonderful selection of foods and drinks and the vast majority of my guests didn't eat anything, but simply passed the plates around I would feel offended.<br>  <br>  I imagine that Jesus might feel the same way.  I mean, He died a torturous death to redeem mankind from sin and death and asked all to remember Him by eating unleavened bread and drinking wine.  He didn't say that only a few should partake and others sit around and ignore His gift. His command was to KEEP DOING THIS in rememberence of me.|`|VxTKNbJRaa	All of the followers of The Watchtower Bible and Tract society with the exception of about 5,000 (+/- a couple of hundred) will reject and spurn the gift of life represented by the bread and wine.<br>  <br>  Spurning the wine and bread is advocated by worshipers of Satan the Devil. The act of not taking the bread and wine is denying Jesus. The JWs do not spit upon the symbols only reject them. Though I am not sure there is any difference.<br>  <br>  Here is some verses in which our Lord and Savior explains this to His followers and non-believers as well:<br>  <br>  John 6:<br>  53 Then Jesus said unto them, Verily, verily, I say unto you, Except ye eat the flesh of the Son of man, and drink his blood, ye have no life in you.<br>  54 Whoso eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, hath eternal life; and I will raise him up at the last day.<br>  55 For my flesh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed.<br>  56 He that eateth my flesh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.<br>  57 As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me.<br>  58 This is that bread which came down from heaven: not as your fathers did eat manna, and are dead: he that eateth of this bread shall live for ever.|`|dmTVbpcWaa	Millions...why?|`|3aVxJYf6aa	funny.....you learnt with JWs what date jesus died for our sins.....not in your Church..but with JWs

No censoring allowed.  <br>  <br>  So there you have it one REALLY bad REALLY disgusting thing about Canada, the broadcasters dont give a damn what kids are watching, and NO I dont have any porno movie channels, I have basic cable. <br>  <br>  I think these people who make these decisions should all be charged with distributing pornography to a minor, or something that would send them to jail for 10 or 12 years. <br>  <br>  Hell Hank Hill is pretty benign compared to this filth
okTecGZfaa	If your letter was completely honest, then no, there is no reason to feel guilty. What is abnormal here is that the company had no business discussing how the manager would be disciplined with you.|`|AA11569882	Wow.  I'd feel guilty, just a little bit.  It depends really on how exact your letter was, if you exagerated at all then I'd be feeling awful, but if what you said was true then somebody better than her would deserve the job.|`|AA12152549	You did the right thing.  If that manager was rude to you then he's probably rude to others as well.  Always report poor service.  That is the only way a restaurant can improve.  Restaurants depend upon customer feedback.|`|AA11209831	I wouldn't feel guilty.<br>  <br>  You got bad service, you were treated like garbage.  You responded, and now action is being taken.  Maybe this will be a wake up call to that manager.<br>  <br>  I have had a few waitresses and one manager fired for the same reason.|`|vZADL4IVaa	Nope, if she can't do her job, it's not your fault...|`|0Iin6kO4aa	no|`|xnq7Nrgkaa	No way, its they're jobs to offer only the best of customer service, and she deserves to be demoted if she can't keep up to the standard that is required. Being in a 'bad mood' is no excuse, she should keep her personal life and mood swings out of the work place.<br>  <br>  However, I would feel a little bad as well if I was in your place so don't worry, it just shows what a good person you are. Chances are, they probably aren't doing much, and that the letter is all talk and no bite.|`|pE0XKXbWaa	No.  You have the right to be treated with respect and not insulted etc. <br>  <br>  I would say that either they have had many other complaints about this person or that the Manager is not happy in their job and therefore the company needs to find somebody who will be happy.<br>  <br>  As for feeling guilty that the Manager may lose their job, I have been in jobs that I have hated but I have always put on a smile and been pleasant to the customers as does everybody else who hates their jobs and the customers.  <br>  <br>  KD|`|JsMd6PrCaa	well, its too bad for her because she could have just been having a not-so-good day, but its not your fault.  You told the company the truth, and they are handling it, the way they think is right.  Obviously they think if she was as you described her, she needs to be retrained or demoted.  That's the companies policy, they don't want their employees to be rude, and in turn this manager should be demoted if she's not being the way she was hired to be.<br>  <br>  Kind of a rough company, but i don't think either of you should feel guilty.|`|BvHRriEyaa	Not at all, you did the right thing! You have helped the community and hopefully she won't be treating anyone else like that! Ignoring it would have just meant she had gotten away with it and would probably continue to be rude to customers.<br>  <br>  This is definitely a result! Good on you :)|`|Wwgobzjaaa	No, I think that they are at least giving her a chance to make things better. If she decides after that to do the same, then she should find a position that she is more comfortable with.|`|N7rQ9luraa	No, you should not feel guilty.  I agree with the others.  She should not have treated anyone in that manner.  It is unlikely that you were the only ones who received such treatment from her.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	No absolutely not, by the sound of things and reading between the lines there may have been other complaints about this "Manager".<br>  Ja.
Wwgobzjaaa	I think that you handled this situation in the appropriate manner. He had his chance, and blew it! You also did the right thing when you told him exactly how you felt, that was the mature and honest thing to do.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	He was probably a kid or a married 60 year old guy who is just getting his 'jollies' flirting with chicks online.  That's why he didn't meet with you.  There are a lot of them out there.  How do I deal with it?  I don't do 'online dating'.|`|G6Uy43coaa	Count Crotchula is right....DATING online does not work so well.  I have a best friend online and we have lots of fun together.   We have fun, converse, have what we feel are meaningful conversations but we never plan to meet.  He will always be my friend and I love him...as a friend. If I meet someone in my real life, my online friend understands that my attention will teeter away from him.  And I know the same is true about him.  Neither of us has met anyone interesting enough to cause that shift yet...so we are cool being friends online.|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Well you know if I found myself out "looking" the last place I would be doing it would be on line.You know me well enough to know I would be "hunting" in a building with a cross on top.<br>  O well, I guess I'm just old fashioned that way.|`|IYPPp3xQaa	he sounds like a retard! And you should find bf by yourself not with the help of stupid online dating sites shhesh!|`|ZaO65qpBaa	I don't like chatting for that very reason...you get too attached to people too quick, if you hit it off without them ever seeing you. And humor and openness are very strong aphrodisiacs,,,,,,<br>  Then one time I sent a few friends pics...the one guy wouldn't leave me alone after that, and the other stopped altogether!!!! LOL!!!!  <br>  I think looking for a relationship that way is 99% sure to fail.

Still, a lot of challenging behaviours are triggered by a need/desire for control/influence/power. (If I can't get you to love me, I'll get you to hate me.) Even our 'normal' behaviours are, like the way young women devote so much time, money and energy into making themselves 'attractive' (relationships with others being one of the great uncontrollables in our lives). Just some examples to hopefully illustrate.<br>  <br>  I suggest a universal block. If you see this account, block it. And keep doing it for every new account. That's the control we have here and this is definitely a time when it's appropriate to use it.|`|sWLRSa6Caa	All actions that are not of Love come out of fear and are a cry for Love.

She never attempted to push her beliefs on others and at times, I disagreed with her religious philosophy but she and I never disagreed about how she or I should treat others.  She was the kindest soul on this earth and I still love her.  I lost my mother on Thursday morning.  My brother, two sisters, dad, aunt, and several nieces and nephews were there to be with her in the last few hours of her life.  She had nothing but love in her heart for others and yet I am sure that over time some may not have cared for her.  She was the strongest woman that I ever met.  I believe that people who act in such a manner do it to be hurtful and find some kind of attention that they can not find in any other way.  I hope that you are well.  Have a great week.<br>  Your Friend,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  It is not a "certain group" who are hateful.  It is people in general who seek attention who become hateful in this world.  I saw a group of men and women who had not sat together and spoken in years gather as brothers and sisters the last two days and talk about a woman who never complained about anything and can continuing illnesses throughout her last thirty years.  She endured more pain then any of us could have ever taken and in the end, I am so glad that she was relieved of that pain and suffering.  She was a Christian but that is not what made her strong.  It was the type of person who never wanted to share her pain with anyone else.<br>  Thanks,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  Pangel,<br>  You are always so loving and caring in your answers.<br>  Thank You for doing so.<br>  ------<br>  Elsie,<br>  Thank you for your kind words.  I do not see atheism as being on the opposite side from theism.  I do see both sides as having their own belief and using what they have found as grounds for their belief.  I have many friends who are not theistic but they are genuine friends in my book and we correspond as much as we are able at this time and have great conversations on many different topics.  Neither side in our case is disrespectful of the others belief/opinion.<br>  Thanks again,<br>  Eds<br>  ------<br>  Filida,<br>  I would also like to thank you!<br>  ------<br>  .|`|66fJYDJaaa	I didn't really understand the first half of the question.

FGcwxZz0aa	Let me put this in as clear language as possible. Any Catholic who endorses the murder of children through abortion or any other means separates themselves from God's family and is no longer a Catholic Christian. The Church is clear in endorsing protection of life and has never made exceptions to the right of everyone to life. This is a fundamental foundational moral teaching of the Church.<br>  <br>  The step-father being accused of rape and being probably guilty of rape is a separate issue. He has committed a sin as well as those murdering these two precious children. God is the final judge of all and he will be punished by God's justice if not by man. I am sure the secular authorities will deal with his crime as they should also prosecute those who perpetrated this double murder of children. God bless!<br>  <br>  In Christ<br>  Fr. Joseph|`|02c88162bffef072e5382461e8afc7f3aa	You must first understand the Catechism is not about canon Law and the very acts committed by all removed them from the life of the Church the Sacraments.Second your at best getting second hand information. And you can use all the emotional human thinking you like and in all honesty if it was my child i'm not sure enough my faith would be strong enough to say no to another murder by abortion. We all have heard that two wrongs does not make a right and in this case this is exactly what is being said that two wrongs make a right.Most of you do not accept Catholic teachings including a sad but large number of those who claim to be Catholic but the fact is Abortion no matter for what reason is never accepted in the Catholic Church teachings. But all those blasting the Catholic Church for what ever reason's i wonder how big is the log in your eyes.How many of you watch porno and use drugs or drink to much or lose much needed money gambling or cheat on your wife's or husbands and use GODs name in Vain.|`|g4AAZRuxaa	If they haven't, they should.|`|AA11598520	The Church doesn't excommunicate for everything.

Personally, I think the mother of the child made the right decision and Catholic authorities have made fools of themselves in the eyes of the world.|`|gDVQNMR7aa	No. The Vatican did not excommunicate the step father.<br>  <br>  I have to wonder how many people actually realize that this abortion was done to save the girl's life. Seems as though many do not. It wasn't done simply because her step father raped her.|`|28216207e17752f6c782dd9a28e07f1faa	Apparently not, because in the twisted doctrine of the Catholic church, the greater offense was the 9-year-old girl's abortion, which saved her life at the expense of a clump of cells.|`|LYnuEdKUaa	No.  Contrary to popular belief, the Church does not excommunicate someone because they "feel" like they should.  There are very exact and well established criteria for excommunication that has been around for quite some time.  Rape is not a qualification for excommunication.  Helping to procure an abortion is.  Also ordaining a bishop without approval or divulging what is said during confession get one excommunicated.<br>  <br>  Sexual misconduct is not on the list of "personal grave sins" because it is not personal, i.e. private.  Rape has a victim, and thus, while grave, does not fall under the category of "personal".|`|AA12304384	The church could not be any more ridiculous than in this matter.

So when a human law ... is contrary to God's law, this human law has no value," Cardoso had said.<br>  <br>  He also said the accused stepfather would not be expelled from the church. Although the man allegedly committed "a heinous crime ... the abortion - the elimination of an innocent life - was more serious".<br>  <br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  <br>  Well, I think your post is great and it illustrates that not all Catholics agree that the girl's abortion was 'wrong'.|`|9VJV2Dcvaa	Hi!! I'm brazilian and we are discussing this a lot in Y!A Brazil....<br>  <br>  Apparently, rape is not a reason for excommunication!!!

uLYlQMs3aa	I am not sure what you mean by putting it to use in modern times... but I think I understand what you are getting at.<br>  <br>  The Reason he spoke so much on the Pharisees is that they were Part of the Nation of Israel. God's chosen nation. The Jewish people consisted of three tribes, Benjamin, Levi (the Priesthood) and of course Judah, hence the name Jews. There were as a matter of course members of the other tribes as well as from a few other nations as well within their national makeup. <br>  He focused on them due in large to the fact that they were responsible for the Law. They were4 supposed to be following and enforcing it with love and responsibility and with justice. They instead were holding to traditions and for going love and mercy. All they cared about the "tradition", so as Christ was adapting and clarifying the law they refused to except it. They hated it so much that they had Christ put to death as to secure their positions in the Roman hierarchy.<br>  So basically he preached to them in hope that they would turn from their ways and follow God as they once had.<br>  As to applying it today... well there are many different ways that it can be applied. <br>  One is prophetical. It is still a message to the Jewish nation and Religion  to turn back to God. <br>  Two is a message to Gods people today, "let no man take your crown" be sure you are not guilty of following certain laws and forsaking others as the Pharisees did. And as most churches do today.<br>  And I bet there are others that don’t come quickly to mind... anyways I hope this helps and feel free to let me know if you have any questions.|`|Fo9ADQLBaa	Because the Pharisees were arrogant and self righteous.<br>  With sinners, there is always hope.<br>  There are so many self righteous and arrogant people who claim to be christians.

Most of the Pharisees thought that they were righteous in God's sight because they held to the outward forms of keeping God's laws. In addition to that, some of the Pharisees were antagonistic towards the Lord Jesus because they apparently didn't accept His teachings and His rejection of their man made traditions.<br>  <br>  Therefore there was a greater area of disagreement between the Lord Jesus and the religious "experts" of His day than there was between people who were not deluding themselves about having a need for divine salvation.<br>  <br>  Luke 18:9  Also He spoke this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and despised others:  10  "Two men went up to the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.  11  The Pharisee stood and prayed thus with himself, 'God, I thank You that I am not like other men--extortioners, unjust, adulterers, or even as this tax collector.  12  I fast twice a week; I give tithes of all that I possess.'  <br>  <br>  13  And the tax collector, standing afar off, would not so much as raise his eyes to heaven, but beat his breast, saying, 'God, be merciful to me a sinner!'  14  I tell you, this man went down to his house justified rather than the other; for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, and he who humbles himself will be exalted."<br>  <br>  Mark 7:1  Then the Pharisees and some of the scribes came together to Him, having come from Jerusalem.  2  Now when they saw some of His disciples eat bread with defiled, that is, with unwashed hands, they found fault.  3  For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands in a special way, holding the tradition of the elders.  4  When they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other things which they have received and hold, like the washing of cups, pitchers, copper vessels, and couches.  <br>  <br>  5  Then the Pharisees and scribes asked Him, "Why do Your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashed hands?" <br>  <br>   6  He answered and said to them, "Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written: 'THIS PEOPLE HONORS ME WITH THEIR LIPS, BUT THEIR HEART IS FAR FROM ME.  7  AND IN VAIN THEY WORSHIP ME, TEACHING AS DOCTRINES THE COMMANDMENTS OF MEN.'  8  For laying aside the commandment of God, you hold the tradition of men-- the washing of pitchers and cups, and many other such things you do." <br>  <br>   9  He said to them, "All too well you reject the commandment of God, that you may keep your tradition.  10  For Moses said, 'HONOR YOUR FATHER AND YOUR MOTHER'; and, 'HE WHO CURSES FATHER OR MOTHER, LET HIM BE PUT TO DEATH.'  11  But you say, 'If a man says to his father or mother, "Whatever profit you might have received from me is Corban"--' (that is, a gift to God),  12  then you no longer let him do anything for his father or his mother,  13  making the word of God of no effect through your tradition which you have handed down. And many such things you do."|`|QyAyQf3Laa	Because the Pharisees, Scribes and false religious leaders fashioned themselves after God and the laws of God but they were nothing but hypocrites. They were the ones supposed to be teaching the people the correct way to behave and draw close to God, but instead they were greeds, puffed up with power, having a form of godliness but proving false to its power.<br>  <br>  The also rejected and murdered Jesus later on. He knew this was coming, but still remained faultless and true to his father. he remained perfect throughout his 33 and a half years in the earth, and was our perfect example.<br>  <br>  These ones were hypocrites and misleading the masses, just as many false religious leaders are misleading and recking the masses of people today.<br>  <br>  Soon, however, these false leaders will perish along with all wicked humans in the earth at Armageddon. <br>  <br>  Won't that be nice? I cannot wait and hope I am judged amongst the living at Armageddon by God.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	Nothing destroys a relationship with God faster than a "religious" spirit.<br>  <br>  Even now people take the word of God to oppress others while boosting their own egos; God can't work through that kind of attitude and frankly it keeps those who need God away from Him.<br>  <br>  Just look at some of those who come here to mock Christians. many do so because the only "Christians" they know are the modern day Pharisee and Sadducee. <br>  <br>  Jesus said those whom society calls last here on earth will be first in the kingdom of God, and those who are first now will be last then.|`|H8WqMK1eaa	Jesus doesn't like religion.|`|d05b366085d8773ec7654e3ad2b991cdaa	Jesus took the Pharisees to task because they changed the law.  The changes were made by extending the range of application of particular laws.  The effect was to build a hedge around the law, so that if it was forbidden to do something, the forbidden area was extended by them to include more area than the original proscription required.  <br>  <br>  This has been explained satisfactorily by the example of a family that has a new white carpet fitted into one of their best reception rooms.  When it is installed, a decision - law - is made that neither food or drink is to be taken into that room for any reason to accomplish the goal of keeping the carpet free from stains.<br>  <br>  Now, if the father were a Pharisee, he would be so concerned that even if the law was not broken deliberately it might be broken by accident.<br>  <br>  To preclude the possibility of accidental transgression the father establishes a hedge around the mitzvoth that makes it illegal for anyone to be closer than three feet from the threshold of the room when the door is open lest, from curiosity, one bearing food and drink although not actually in the forbidden room by reason that his feet are not on the forbidden side of the threshold line but are in the hallway, might, possibly, accidentally drop or spill the food and drink held in his hands.<br>  <br>  This kind of thing could happen if a sibling, a mad dog, or even a wild horse in a mad mood bolts down the hallway, striking him on the legs, feet, or back, and cause an innocent to become a malefactor.<br>  <br>  To preclude this possibility - admittedly the wild horse is less likely to happen than is a poke in the back from a jealous sibling because the curious one is holding what is left of the last Twinkie in the box - the Pharisaic Phather then extends the scope of the law to include that area of the hallway that is three feet from the threshold.<br>  <br>  His reason is to prevent someone from being able to mar the carpet accidentally in the same way that the Parush addressed and castigated by Jesus had made the laws of God difficult to obey because of their illegal and unauthorised extensions.<br>  <br>  God understands sin and in order to accommodate it has established the principle of repentance to restore balance in frail humanity when they yield to impulses not approved by God.  <br>  <br>  It was not that the Pharisees were greater sinners than everyone else that exercised Jesus, but the fact that they laid burdens of obedience on ordinary worshippers that God had deigned not to.<br>  <br>  There are Pharisees amongst us today.  They are recognisable by their adherence to non-biblical teachings and requirements of their flocks, one such instance being the 'requirement' of converts to speak in tongues among some Pentecostal churches.<br>  <br>  Such proof of conversion is not required from Jesus or his apostles but is an interpolation that supports a particular theological position, of which there are many similar examples. <br>  <br>  Whilst it is not polite to make enemies of such, it is impolite to God to follow them in their departure from what is revealed.<br>  <br>  BTW  -  Judaism, ancient and modern has 635 commandments or laws. 3500+ is just a little exaggerated.<br>  <br>  QUILL|`|N53y9qohaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  Jesus point to the Pharisees that they were so obsessed with the 3500 + laws and religious laws along with their intellectual snobbery , governing the lives of the Ist century Jews that they totally forgot about the basic welfare and kindness toward their fellow man.<br>  <br>  Tha Pharisees were the conservative upper echelon of that society who liked their status quo, kissed the butts of their Roman overlords and looked down on others who did not match up to their standards.<br>  <br>  Cheers,<br>  <br>  Michael Kelly|`|akvrwpywaa	The Pharisees were hypocrites.<br>  Back in that day, the religious people were the most respected.  The Pharisees were an "elitist" group that were always worshiping--and making sure everyone knew it (so it was like empty worship); they were doing it mainly just so that people would look at them and think they were such great people|`|d8zxbKduaa	The Pharisees were the religious leaders of that day. People looked up to them for guidance into God's kingdom. Jesus knew their hearts and called them hypocrites because they did not practice what they preached. He was mad at them because they were representing God and people were getting a wrong impression of what God was like.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	The Pharisees rejected Jesus, that's the first point to understand. <br>  <br>  The Pharisees also added their own rules that they forced on people, that's another thing to understand. <br>  <br>  Those are two main reasons why Jesus spoke against Phariseeism.|`|b02b80202f3e9ef2663844e95c136d09aa	A Pharisee is a person who has false beliefs about Christ.

They pretended that they were good people when they commited other sins, such as greed.  Plus, they weren't being "righteous" for God, but so people would respect them (pride).  Average sinners are more likely to admit they do wrong, which of course makes actually changing easier.  It's easier for God to work with a humble person than one who thinks (or pretends) they're perfect.<br>  <br>  I also seem to remember that the Pharisees did things like cheating widows and other things like that.<br>  <br>  I like to think of it as Alcoholics Anonymous... the first step is admittance.<br>  <br>  I hope I answered your question.<br>  <br>  Edit: <br>  Oops, I forgot to answer the second part.  In modern times, Pharisees are probably like respected people who liked to flaunt their good deeds.  Basically politicians (but we know they're all scumbags...) and people who donate a million dollars to charities.  Also I suppose there are many Church attenders who just want others to think they're "good."<br>  <br>  Jesus eating dinner with sinners would be like Him eating dinner with crack addict over the Governor.<br>  <br>  Again, I hope I helped!|`|MqLxwsw7aa	Then like today the problems really haven't changed much.

Only people who don't believe the bible to be the word of god can understand that it is a load of garbage.  I urge you to continue your critical thinking of the bible. Question anything that does not make sense.  But stop asking others to explain it to you.  They will only tell you what they believe.  You will find the answers all by yourself as long as you stay in that frame of mind.  Listen to your conscience, reason and logic, not someone else's.  It will help to free your mind.  Good luck and happy freethinking!|`|HzvyASt3aa	Because in the eyes of Jesus they were worse than the sinners. Remember he said "judge not lest ye be judged" he was directing it at the Pharisees.

Fear tactics, Lies and manipulations.|`|kE1WUus2aa	Like everybody else said, the Pharisees were hypocrites because they do not follow the Word of God and they pretend to be highly religious so people can look at them as religious people. Jesus detested that! There was a parable where two men went into church to pray. One was a pharisee and the second one is a tax collector. The pharisee prayed,"O' lord, you know that I'm a righteous man; thank god I'm not like that tax collector over there!' The tax collector prayed, "Oh, lord! Please forgive me for my horrible sins! Please come into my heart!|`|TzNdXVmPaa	First of all, do you believe the whole bible as God's inspired word? A lot of priests and preachers don't. The Pharisees believed all scripture of their day, but rejected Jesus Christ. Today some Preachers say they believe in Jesus Christ, but rejected some of the Holy Bible claiming some of it to be just stories. Please don't misunderstand. There are church leaders who believe the whole bible is the word of God. Either way, you can't have one without the other. The Pharisees became proud. Jesus knew their hearts before he came to earth. All of us are sinners. Jesus was sent to take our sins upon himself, but we cannot let our pride stand in the way as not to call on him to come into our hearts. He is our one and only way to salvation. We must know him personally, and love him with all our heart and soul, and repent. He loves us all. The Pharisees were losing followers. They were jealous of Jesus, and on, and on, and on.|`|Api5zLaeaa	Today's Pharisees are right where the first century ones were. At the head of the church. If a pastor uses the rules of the Church to control your actions, RUN!!!
QVKWVValaa	Do you mean things like the Spanish Inquisition, during which the Pope sanctioned the use of whatever means necessary - including killing people - to battle the rise of religious unorthodoxy?<br>  Or how about the whole Manifest Destiny thing, a religiously inspired idea that the USA had a God given right to all the lands of North America, that led to the ethnic cleansing (which some could see as multiple religiously inspired death-sentences) of almost all of the Native American population.<br>  There was also the Crusades, during which the Pope passed a universal death sentence on any inhabitant of the Holy Land who wasn't Christian.<br>  More recently, I believe the anti-gay hatred prevalent in US Christianity has led to the pandemic of gay bashing. And since the hatred that led to the beatings and killings of gays is religiously inspired, one could say that is a religiously inspired death sentence.<br>  Lastly, bombings of women's health clinics, or more precisely the targeted killing of doctors that work in such clinics, is a religiously inspired death sentence, since the hatred fueling the killings is based on a religious belief. <br>  And in the last two cases, it doesn't matter that someone as religiously significant as an Ayatollah or a Pope give the order. There is no such position in US Protestant Christianity. The leader of a single church, or church group, must serve the purposes and functions of Ayatollah or Pope in US Protestant Christianity. And as long as that church leader says, "Killing baby killers, or unbridled hatred for gays, is okay by them," that is a religiously inspired death-sentence.|`|pfNnuD5saa	Sure, people have always had to flee.

Afrocentrists insist that everyone was black, and that everything black is great and that everything white is inferior. Eurocentrists insist that everyone was white, and that everything white is great and everything black is inferior. Neither group presents their argument as anything more than emotional and poorly substantiated. Both groups can be ignored. Unfortunately, Eurocentrism has become so ingrained in Anglo-American culture, that as become unquestioned and immune to intelligent criticism.<br>  The original texts from a few hundred years ago that defined the field of Egyptology, were written during the same time as the western slave trade. It remains no secret that a primary tactic used in the marketing of American slavery, was the argument that "black people" were inferior to all other peoples on the planet. This viewpoint was supported using faux historical evidence that clearly showed black people to be eternally primitive. It was in this whirlwind of racist propaganda that we first hear talk of Egypt being not only non-African, but non-black.<br>  Initially Egyptology's supported slavery by claiming that the Ancient Egyptians were black, but a different kind of "intelligent ***** race" that was an historical anomaly. Later the argument shifted to a new paradigm that featured Caucasian Egyptians back primarily by the theory that black people were incapable of building any sort of civilization. At this point in time, the primary agenda in all American studies of Africa was to further justify the western slave trade. Prior to this era of extreme racial persecution and enslavement of Africans, the notion that Ancient Egypt was home to non-black peoples did not exist.<br>  The origins of the Egyptians, as the evidence dictates, was not the result of a northern Asian migration, but the result of a southern migration. The people of the norther Nile valley migrated from the drying Sahara and migrated northward to modern Egypt and Nubia. The Egyptians traced their origins to the land of Punt, which lies in the southern part of modern day Sudan. Regardless of which way it is examined, it is clear that the Egyptians and the Nubian's came from the same region of Africa originally and physically would not have been extremely different. All of the ancient sources note the differences between the two groups, but nothing that ventures beyond what we would call black people. Being lighter skinned than a Nubian in no way indicates a complete shift in racial type. Look at the figures of the American Civil Rights movement. You have people with literally black skin like Stokely Carmichael, but then you have Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X with his light skin, red hair and freckles. The contradiction lies in the assumption that any deviation from the supposed Nubian type indicates a racial shift. Any Roman source will tell you the physical differences between a Roman and a Gaul, but we don't make the assumption that one of the must be non-white.<br>  The modern population of Egypt reflects many, many occupations, migrations and conquests. The Middle Eastern Arabs who dominate the population now did no show up in any real numbers prior to the 7th century AD. The Egypt was not heavily mixed during the thousands of years when it was the world's superpower. It was mixed, but with people who were very similar in type to themselves. After it's fall, it became extremely mixed as a result of people migrating and conquering from all over the world.<br>  For the Egyptians to have been non-black a few scientific firsts would have had to occurred. One, an indigenous population would have to go from being extremely black, the Nubian's, to a completely different racial type in the absence of significant climatic change or the presence of a massive foreign settlement. Two, all of the eye witness accounts, archaeological evidence, and literature that spans thousands of years, would be completely wrong when it comes to the basic description of a people. Trusting early American and European Egyptology's writing during the time of slavery, over the words of people who traveled to Ancient Egypt and described what they saw before their very eyes, should be considered truly foolish.<br>  All of the ancient sources clearly point to the Egyptians being native Africans. Also Native Middle Eastern There are no indigenous peoples of Africa who fall out of the category of "N3gro." Every non-black African population and comfortably trace their origins back to a specific non-African country. If the Egyptians were native Africans, which the evidence supports, then they would have been what we call black people. All Native Egyptians did not live in Africa.<br>  This is most of what people get confused, because since Egypt is in Africa, but Middle Eastern decents were migrating to those nations close by including Egypt, so when you hear people say many were Arab/Caucasian decent that's true as well.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	I agree!!!!!

They did interbreed with Africans from the South, however the majority was Arabian descent.  As I have mentioned before, Genetics do not lie.

I've never seen a stoner cause a bunch of problems, but I've seen it plenty with drunks. We already know prohibition doesn't work for alcohol, and we can guess it's not working for pot. Legalize it. Tax it. Make it profitable. Get all those non-violent offenders who were caught with a bunch of pot out of our prisons and jails. I'm tired of paying for their room and board. <br>  <br>  If you don't like it - don't use it. Don't hang out with people who do if it bothers you. I don't hang out with drunks or tweakers and if I can avoid those, surely you can avoid a few stoners. Especially since most of them can't even get off their couches after a few hits...
0KR4wyoQaa	Sorry, this is too much to read, but im saying 2 things.<br>  <br>  1) I used to smoke marijuana but I quit.<br>  2) No, people who don't smoke marijuana are not necessarily oppressed.|`|2gyJUTzRaa	i wouldn't say oppressed.  i think the people who absolutely refuse to ever smoke marijuana are brainwashed though, and incapable of thinking for themselves; they refuse to do something that's harmless, but believe it's harmful because of what someone else baselessly told them.|`|5PKrR25Qaa	Just because i be gettin high don't mean i am a dangerous person. you just generalize half the world.|`|wTqid2ONaa	Lol, nobody's making you smoke.  I think you could use some though, you sound very stressed.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	lol i disagree. when i use marijuana it is in my own home for medicinal reasons... i'm not blowing smoke in your face!|`|6aNRf7ENaa	Well you don't have to start smoking pot just because everyone else is. I don't hang out with potheads because they're annoying. They blab about how natural it is and stuff and w/e but if it is natural then I wouldn't be able to tell if they were high. Makes most of them unnaturally relaxed in situations. They can do whatever they want I don't care as long as they don't bother me there's no problem.|`|QzGWYFvVaa	I googled and got this response...<br>  <br>  "Interestingly, in a 1988 ruling that marijuana should be reclassified to allow medicinal use, Drug Enforcement Administration Judge Francis Young concluded that "In strict medical terms marijuana is far safer than many foods. For example, eating 10 raw potatoes can result in a toxic response. By comparison, it is physically impossible to eat enough marijuana to induce death. Marijuana in its natural form is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man. By any measure of rational analysis marijuana can be safely used within the supervised routine of medical care.""<br>  <br>  "The evidence in this record [9-6-88 ruling] clearly shows that marijuana has been accepted as capable of relieving the distress of great numbers of very ill people, and doing so with safety under medical supervision. It would be unreasonable, arbitrary and capricious for DEA to continue to stand between those sufferers and the benefits of this substance in light of the evidence in this record."<br>  <br>  In 1999, a White House-commissioned Institute of Medicine report declared that, ''Nausea, appetite loss, pain and anxiety . . . all can be mitigated by marijuana.'' And in 2002, a Canadian Senate committee concluded that ''there are clear . . . indications of the therapeutic benefits of marijuana."<br>  <br>  In 1982 an 18-member committee of the National Academy of Sciences who had studied the drug laws for four years unanimously advocated decriminalizing marijuana, and eventually legalizing and regulating it, only to have Reagan’s science adviser, Dr. Frank Press, repudiate their report and successfully pressure the media not to publicize it.<br>  <br>  In December 1997, the UN World Health Organization received a report it had commissioned on marijuana. Unknown officials of the National Institute on Drug Abuse and the UN International Drug Control Programme browbeat the WHO into withholding parts of it from publication. The deleted portions stated that cannabis is not addictive, does not lead to use of other drugs, poses no risk of lung damage or other serious long-term health problems, is less harmful than alcohol or tobacco, and would remain so even if it were used as much as these two legal drugs.<br>  <br>  Nixon had appointed Pennsylvania governor Raymond Schaffer chairman of a commission to study the effects of marijuana on society, perhaps unaware that Shaffer was primed to do an honest job because he’d been made to look like fool by an anti-drug zealot a few years before. He had called for new a enforcement effort against LSD after six college students had gone blind from staring at the sun while tripping—only to find that the tale was a hoax made up by Dr. Norman Yoder of the state Welfare Department’s Office of the Blind. The Shaffer report found marijuana to be the safest of all popular drugs, including the legal ones, and recommended immediate decriminalization. Nixon ceremoniously threw it in the Oval Office wastebasket without opening it.<br>  <br>  The journal PHARMACOLOGICAL REVIEWS reports that decades of research prove that, "Compared with legal drugs...marijuana does not pose greater risks." Yet based upon mortality statistics, we can safely con- clude that cannabis is one of the safest medical drugs known, for, while prescription drugs, defined as safe by the FDA, kill up to 27,000 and aspirin up to 1,000 Americans per year, cannabis kills 0 per year .<br>  <br>  In the 20 years since DARE began, scientific evaluation studies have consistently shown that DARE is ineffective in reducing the use of alcohol and drugs and is sometimes even counterproductive -- worse than doing nothing. That's the conclusion of the U.S. General Accounting Office, the U.S. Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences, and the U.S. Department of Education, among many others.<br>  <br>  IT'S NOT WORKING<br>  <br>  In fact, marijuana enforcement has had no discernable long-term impact on marijuana availability or use. According to the National Center on Addiction and Substance Abuse at Columbia University, teenagers report that marijuana has surpassed tobacco and alcohol as the easiest drug to obtain. This result is hardly surprising, givern that annual federal data compiled by the University of Michigan's Monitoring the Future project reports that an estimated 86 percent of 12th graders say that marijuana is "fairly easy" or "very easy to get". This percentage has remained virtually unchanged since the mid-1970s - despite remarkably increased marijuana penalties, enforcement, and the prevalence of anti-marijuana propaganda since that time.<br>  <br>  The percentage of adolescents experimenting with marijuana has also held steady over the long-term. According to annual data compiled by Monitoring the Future, 47.3 percent of 12th graders reported having used marijuana in 1975. Despite the billions of dollars spent on drug enforcement and drug education efforts (such as the federally funded DARE program) since that time, today's number (for the Class of 2

If you're Asian, they can create the double eyelid and remove fat which will widen your eyes. Also as they're not operating on your eyeball, there's little risk of going blind. I've heard of eyes being widened by breaking the bone around it but it's obviously a very complicated and painful experience so it's not performed unless desperately needed.|`|R1Fc344laa	ok r u talking about ur eyelids drooping over the top of your eye? cuz that happens to a looot of people. u can get upper eyelid surgery it costs like 3500$usd but that has nothing to do with your eye SOCKET|`|jzEo2Qtfaa	I dont think so, Because Surgery on an eye usually can leave you Blind.(Especially since if you get surgery they have to clean the area first with a special chemical substance.)<br>   But you can ask your docter to see what he/she says about surgery
yKycwvf8aa	1) Practice, practice, practice.  The more you practice, the better your delivery.<br>  2) Pick a spot on the forehead or eyebrow instead of looking in the eye.  It will still give them the appearance that you're looking them in the eye.<br>  3) Try to relax and have fun.  Accept the fact that eventually you are going to mess up.  You're human.  In many cases the audience won't be able to tell you messed up if you keep going and act like nothing happened.  If it is very obvious you messed up, make a joke about it.  Say something like "Sorry folks, I was having a Bush moment."|`|GZUZqazcaa	I used to be like that when I was in the 5-8 grade.Most of it was because in my elementary school days I was never accepted,called fat,teased,and stabbed in the back by people who were my so called friends.I was basically afraid of what people would think of me.At the end of my 8th grade year,I decided to get over that fear because it was hindering me from doing simple tasks.The way I got over it was by telling myself that no matter what I do or say,people will have their opinions of me,and their opinon doesn't matter because most likely,I will never see them again in my life,and they don't make me who I am,I make me who I am,and I make me what my life will be.I determine the path,my career goals,my dreams,i'm me and no one can change that.<br>  <br>  Try to do your best,don't look directly at the crowd,look at the wall wayyyyyy in the back,find a focusing point,and don't direct your attention from it!<br>  <br>  You need to find the root of your problem,why do you feel the way you feel?Is it because you're scared of people,shy,afraid of what people will think of you,or even low self esteem?Once you find the root of the problem,work your way up from there :).<br>  <br>  I hope i've helped!|`|WAkUBPORaa	Then look in the back of the room.

Since it isn't rocket science to figure out that gay rights are good, they believe that gay rights are good.<br>  <br>  Here's the dumbed down version.  It's called LOGIC 101:<br>  <br>  All people are equal under the law.<br>  Gays and straights are people, therefore they are equal.<br>  Straights have a right that gays don't have.<br>  We need to fix this to make them equal.<br>  <br>  and...<br>  <br>  Things that don't hurt anyone aren't bad.<br>  Gay marriage doesn't hurt anyone<br>  Gay marriage isn't bad.<br>  <br>  Brain surgery, isn't it!?<br>  <br>  And you can't be "over"protective of equal rights.  I suppose the folks who encouraged the desegregation of schools were "overprotective" of black's rights?  The Suffragettes were "overprotective" of women's rights?  Those who advocated child labor laws were "overprotective" of children's rights?<br>  <br>  Besides, you can't protect something that doesn't exist yet.  When gays have rights, we will protect them.  Until then, we will fight for them to exist.<br>  <br>  BTW, a reminder to the atheists who think that theists are ALL bigoted and nasty and hate others, may I remind you there is more than one religion!|`|de2AwHpHaa	we believe in civil liberties for all.|`|bRLCxmP6aa	It's not gay rights, specifically, that I'm trying to protect - it's equal rights...it's everyone's rights.

The right to choose. I protect gay rights because its the right thing to do. No one should be treated the way you theists treat them.|`|5qFmukWwaa	Because its not gay rights, its civil rights.  If you deny civil rights to one group, which group is next?|`|gGmMw2vDaa	Unlike christians, we care about civil rights.|`|rGEZup0Zaa	Because denying them is a violation of basic human rights.<br>  <br>  I didn't realize that atheism had any special purview over the subject of homosexuality equality. Huh, learn something new everyday.

Sad.|`|2f6d591b87634e2c1909160eb45e94a1aa	Because many homosexuals have left their churches, due to the traditional Biblical injunctions against homosexuality... so there is a significant overlap between the two groups.  Now there are religious gays (I know a few) and there are lots of  straight atheists, but there is a large overlap.<br>  <br>  Also both groups share a common cause in that they hate traditional orthodox Christianity.|`|23033d499769542e5e7910234a60e4f7aa	I am concerned about all rights including yours... <br>  <br>   Remember when you take away, suppress and/or violate the rights of another you are setting precedent for your rights to be taken, suppressed and/or violated in the future... <br>  <br>  Anyone with the sense of cabbage would be for protecting all rights for all people in order to protect their own....|`|PjwWWMu4aa	I don't think its possible to be overprotective of any human right. <br>  <br>  The right to equal treatment regardless of gender, race, or sexuality (or anything else for that matter) is one such right. Currently, homosexuals in the USA are denied this equality.|`|ttTDiJWfaa	Why do so many christians in fact display homophobia too vulgar to be described here?<br>  <br>  Human rights are good things.

And why do they seek to redefine morality so that "equality" becomes a dirty word?<br>  <br>  Decent, patriotic Americans believe in equality for all.  This concern cuts across political, social and religious lines.  Thousands of churches find homophobia to be morally repugnant and believe all members are worthy of the love of Christ.  <br>  <br>  We are told to treat others as we want to be treated. This does not mean "take away the civil rights from law-abiding, taxpaying, gay Americans." How sad that some cannot understand that, ignore their own sins and throw stones at others.|`|hYzfzu9yaa	Overprotective? Are you serious? Human equality, freedom, and the rights endowed to every citizen of this country shouldn't even be in question! We shouldn't HAVE to fight for our rights! But some people are hell-bent on stripping us of our humanity and denying us equality in OUR OWN COUNTRY. **** you. Wanting to marry the woman I love is not "overprotective".|`|nIu8zVkXaa	I suspect that most Gays are atheists for one reason but I'd just like to know what "Gay Rights" are.  I looked all through my copy of the United States Constitution and I can't find it anywhere in there.  I couldn't find abortion rights in there either.  Now isn't that strange!  Hmmmmmmm!|`|KVBTtF9faa	Maybe it's because the atheists are the only ones human enough to care about EQUAL RIGHTS FOR ALL and a true separation of church and state. Your religion should not dictate my rights. (I'm not gay by the way, just saying that no religion has the right to dictate anyones rights).|`|Znw52fxkaa	Why did women fight to have equal rights?<br>  Why did black people fight to be classed as humans and not second class citizens?<br>  Why does anyone want rights?<br>  <br>  Because everyone is entitled to them, whether everyone believes it or not.|`|91XGHfSaaa	It's a normal reaction to ignorant bigotry.

But the fact that it pisses you guys off makes it fun.|`|fE628A9xaa	That is a poorly generalized assumption.  You are putting atheists in a class as if they hav the same set of beliefs to go by.  The only thing that atheists have in common with one another is that they lack a belief in any god(s).  That is the "golden rule" of atheism and the only rule of atheism. To say that atheists are overprotective of gay rights would be like saying theists are overprotective of gods rights (theists believe in a god or gods, but not all believe in the same god or gods).  Neither atheism nor theism is based upon any set of specific views or ideas.  Get that straight first.<br>  You are confusing atheism with humanism (specifically secular humanism) which many people do.  Although not all atheists are secular humanists, all secular humanists claim some form of atheism. <br>  Your question would then have to be "Why are secular humanists so overprotective of gay rights?"<br>  This would be like asking "Why are people that believe in their god so overprotective of their god's will?"<br>  <br>  Do you now see how ridiculous this question is?|`|c5ffa63bef1a57e12459947bb46f6b28aa	Somebody's got to stand up for them.

4sh2oRR7aa	I'm mixed and maybe it's just my geography but every black person between 13-40 generally act the same. The women want to be bootylicious, oh-no-you-didn't attitude and Baby Phat wearing. Men want to be homeboys (usually rappers is their career choice) who wear their pants down to their knees and would rather buy bling or put rims on a 20 year old car rather than pay their bills. The older generation though, seems a lot more well rounded like they're two different species who aren't related in any way. A lot of younger black people feel if they don't act hood or ghetto they're not black and if they go to Harvard, wear polo shirts and live in the Suburbs, they're acting white and betraying black people. However black Americans who are born/raised in Africa or the first generation of American tend to act a lot better. They're hardworking, honest and just plain nice most of the time. My town has a section that's primarily African immigrants and it's a very peaceful neighborhood. I know 60 and 70 year old African couples who work at Wal-Mart as janitors but an unemployed black guy who wants to be ghetto thinks that kind of job is too good for him.|`|4Vmlf902aa	Do you know all the black ppl in this country? So I guess you act like us since you're half black, huh? I don't act nothing like other black guys I know.|`|YA36FUf1aa	That's because you are looking for it. All people of all skin colours have a wide diversity of actions, it is just that society is often quicker to label and stereotype people of visible ethnic minorities and be far less tolerant of their behaviour because their very presence challenges the hierarchy of society by demonstrating to people that not everybody is like them and thus helping people realise that it is wrong for one group to assert dominance over another. If they have the bravery to retain their own distinct cultural ideas then they are also potentially upsetting a hegemony, something which the powers that be wouldn't tolerate. So they encourage supiciousness around people of a 'different' racial heritage to maintain their own position.<br>  <br>  The other possibility is that they have just fallen into the trap of negative and offensive racist stereotypes and caricatures.|`|VsamHLPOaa	I'm mixed and I don't think all black ppl act the same.

5tY3eZcoaa	Here's my answer on Ancient Egyptians(gave this on another question)<br>  <br>  <br>  It is important to separate Afrocentrists and Eurocentrists from legitimate scholarship. Afrocentrists insist that everyone was black, and that everything black is great and that everything white is inferior. Eurocentrists insist that everyone was white, and that everything white is great and everything black is inferior. Neither group presents their argument as anything more than emotional and poorly substantiated. Both groups can be ignored. Unfortunately, Eurocentrism has become so ingrained in Anglo-American culture, that as become unquestioned and immune to intelligent criticism.<br>  The original texts from a few hundred years ago that defined the field of Egyptology, were written during the same time as the western slave trade. It remains no secret that a primary tactic used in the marketing of American slavery, was the argument that "black people" were inferior to all other peoples on the planet. This viewpoint was supported using fact historical evidence that clearly showed black people to be eternally primitive. It was in this whirlwind of racist propaganda that we first hear talk of Egypt being not only non-African, but non-black.<br>  Initially Egyptology's supported slavery by claiming that the Ancient Egyptians were black, but a different kind of "intelligent negro race" that was an historical anomaly. Later the argument shifted to a new paradigm that featured Caucasian Egyptians back primarily by the theory that black people were incapable of building any sort of civilization. At this point in time, the primary agenda in all American studies of Africa was to further justify the western slave trade. Prior to this era of extreme racial persecution and enslavement of Africans, the notion that Ancient Egypt was home to non-black peoples did not exist.<br>  The origins of the Egyptians, as the evidence dictates, was not the result of a northern Asian migration, but the result of a southern migration. The people of the norther Nile valley migrated from the drying Sahara and migrated northward to modern Egypt and Nubia. The Egyptians traced their origins to the land of Punt, which lies in the southern part of modern day Sudan. Regardless of which way it is examined, it is clear that the Egyptians and the Nubian's came from the same region of Africa originally and physically would not have been extremely different. All of the ancient sources note the differences between the two groups, but nothing that ventures beyond what we would call black people. Being lighter skinned than a Nubian in no way indicates a complete shift in racial type. Look at the figures of the American Civil Rights movement. You have people with literally black skin like Stokely Carmichael, but then you have Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and Malcolm X with his light skin, red hair and freckles. The contradiction lies in the assumption that any deviation from the supposed Nubian type indicates a racial shift. Any Roman source will tell you the physical differences between a Roman and a Gaul, but we don't make the assumption that one of the must be non-white.<br>  The modern population of Egypt reflects many, many occupations, migrations and conquests. The Middle Eastern Arabs who dominate the population now did no show up in any real numbers prior to the 7th century AD. The Egypt was not heavily mixed during the thousands of years when it was the world's superpower. It was mixed, but with people who were very similar in type to themselves. After it's fall, it became extremely mixed as a result of people migrating and conquering from all over the world.<br>  For the Egyptians to have been non-black a few scientific firsts would have had to occurred. One, an indigenous population would have to go from being extremely black, the Nubian's, to a completely different racial type in the absence of significant climatic change or the presence of a massive foreign settlement. Two, all of the eye witness accounts, archaeological evidence, and literature that spans thousands of years, would be completely wrong when it comes to the basic description of a people. Trusting early American and European Egyptology's writing during the time of slavery, over the words of people who traveled to Ancient Egypt and described what they saw before their very eyes, should be considered truly foolish.<br>  All of the ancient sources clearly point to the Egyptians being native Africans. Also Native Middle Eastern There are no indigenous peoples of Africa who fall out of the category of "negro." Every non-black African population and comfortably trace their origins back to a specific non-African country. If the Egyptians were native Africans, which the evidence supports, then they would have been what we call black people. All Native Egyptians did not live in Africa.<br>  This is most of what people get confused, because since Egypt is in Africa, but Middle Eastern decents were migrating to those nations close by including Egypt, so when you hear people say many were Arab/Caucasian decent that's true as well.|`|4sh2oRR7aa	No. African tribes didn't read or write for the majority so their history was purely oral. Eventually, people intermarried, information stopped being passed down, new culture came into order, war took over existing tribes, languages faded, the new beliefs prospered and the people who knew the old ways died.<br>  <br>  Ancient Rome, Egypt, Asia, ect- That exists because those places wrote down their history. Otherwise, theirs would be lost too. The majority of everything we know about Rome is the fact that Romans took records on everything.|`|6NEPcZFfaa	White people of the past wanted to feel superior to black people so they decided to ignore their history.

T1beLIQqaa	NO, THEY WERE/CURRENTLY, ARE, ARAB SEMITIC WHITE. EVERYONE, Arabs ARE White(Semitic, like the closely related Jews). Genetic studies indicate most of the Ancient Egyptian mummies are Arab Semitic White, followed by a small amount of Nubians-people of Kemit-Sudanese and some Nilotics, Black/Arab mix-most experts consider this mix to be the Hamites,the Berbers and Moors are essentially Arabs with 8-15% Black heritage, and a smaller amount of Indo European Aryan Whites(Iranians/Persians, Greeks, Romans, Turks) and Asiatics(both Oriental and non Oriental).The population break down of Ancient Egypt has remained the same as present day Egypt-65% Arab Semitic White, 30% Black(mostly Nubian, some Nilotic), Black/Arab mix, and 5% all other ethnicities.The Ancient Egyptians in their "Book of the Gates" (see link) clearly delineated themselves from the Black Nubians See the following links for more information: <br>    <br>  <a href="http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpress.com/2008/07/22/the-faces-of-ancient-egypt/" rel="nofollow">http://mathildasanthropologyblog.wordpre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/enbp/pbs.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gates" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_Gat...</a><br>  <br>  In the Ancient Egyptian "Book of the Gates"-the dark brown Ancient Egyptians very clearly DELINEATE themselves from the black, Black Nubians.<br>  <br>  ***Lalu212 in your link, two are incorrectly labeled and are as follows, Libyan, a Nubian, an Asiatic, and an Egyptian NOT Syrian, Nubian, Libyan, and Egyptian.***<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wally_mo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.com/wally_mo/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catchpenny.org/race.html</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/RaceOfAncientEgypt.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.jrbooksonline.com/PDF_Books/R...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/12/13/where-the-ancient-egyptians-black-or-white/" rel="nofollow">http://naturescorner.wordpress.com/2008/...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  NOTE: Afro centrists attempt to portray the Nubians as the Ancient Egyptians against scientific evidence, including DNA testing(haploid) and anthropological measurements of the mummies.This link from above shows the genetic proof -the Hamitic theory is outdated and proven wrong by DNA testing(haploid):<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_africa/v032/32.1keita.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/history_in_...</a><br>  <br>  Arabs are classified as Caucasian, although most are swarthy and have the same coloration as many of the Southern Indo European Aryan Whites-Iranians/Persians, Greeks, Southern Italians, Southern Germans, and the Tamilils of India(very dark brown).Arabs also get much darker in Egypt's climate.Many of the Egyptian murals show many different peoples with different facial features and skin coloration because of the mix as described above.

Part of the reason for the war there is that the indigenous Black Sudanese feel the immigrant Arab Semitic Whites had spread too fast and want to annex Sudan to Egypt.<br>  <br>  BOTTOMLINE, MOST ANCIENT EGYPTIAN MUMMIES, TESTED BY DNA TESTING ARE Arab Semitic White, FOLLOWED BY VERY SMALL AMOUNTS OF Nubian-Sudanese-people of Kemet(some Nilotics TO),AND EVEN SMALLER AMOUNTS OF ALL OTHER ETHNICITIES.<br>  <br>  All Africans were originally Black, is a misconception, especially popular among Afro centrists and bigots of all ethnicities.There were TWO forms of Homo sapiens(both extinct-modern humans are Homo sapiens sapiens, a subclaasification) in Africa about the same time - Homo sapiens Idaltu(had N*egroid features) and Homo sapiens Cro Magnon(had Causcoid features). The indigenous peoples of Maghreb(generally applied to all of Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia, but in older Arabic usage pertained only to the area of the three countries between the high ranges of the Atlas Mountains and the Mediterranean Sea) are classified as Aboriginal Caucasoid(White/appearing White).Currently, a full 1/3 of Africa(North) is Arab Semitic White as well as smaller amounts of Jews(Semitic White,closely related to the Arabs) and Indo European Aryan Whites and even smaller amounts of other ethnicities.<br>  <br>  NINE-we have been through this before-suffice to say-DNA(haploid) testing CLEARLY shows YOU ARE WRONG-see the links above since you will keep insisting on your way based on hearsy.DNA is where it is at and you are wrong.Arabs have NO Black haploid markers. Read up on your mother's Black heritage-Nok was an ancient, advanced Black culure in present day Nigeria. Black Nubian Pharoahs ruled Egypt from only 800-700 B.C. You do know Sudan is considered part of Arab Semitic White North Africa and half their population is Arab Semitic White.Can you not tell Jamie Farr(Semitic White-Arab American-Klinger on Mash) and the late Dean Martin(Indo European Aryan White-Italian American(like your father) are White and in a different ethnic group than Bill Cosby(Black American)-surely you can see that.I know you think because they are dark, they are Black-wrong again.Now, instead of ranting and raving PRESENT DNA proof of what you speak as I have in the links-you simply CAN NOT-so what  you procaim to be the truth, is NOT.<br>  <br>  The following should clearify things for your thinking:<br>  Mostafa Hefny,is a Black Nubian born in Egypt Arab Semitic White. When he came to the US(Detroit Michigan), he was classified as White because Egypt is Arab Semitic White, not Black Nubia.He sued the US government to be again classified as Black Nubian, as he was in Egypt.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1030876701.html;jsessionid=F297D4F420700ED29340B14CB" rel="nofollow">http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/...</a>|`|4Vmlf902aa	Maybe because of their location,etc. Egypt is considered to be in the middle east, I think. So when ppl hear that they assume Egyptians are Arab,etc. Also Egyptians are generally lighter than say Nigerians, Kenyans,etc. So ppl who think all Africans are dark think Egyptians aren't black cause they don't fit, well most, into that category. <br>  <br>  Scarlett: Technically Egpty is in AFRICA!

The British family didn't intermarry with non-whites.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	coming from me. this is my opinion.<br>  i think since egypt is right by the middle east, i think that there were more arabic people there than black or white, so i'd think that ancient egyptians were arabic.|`|DfDss68haa	Real answer: We live in a Eurocentric society that does not want to acknowledge the contributions of anyone other than white people. And expands it's definition of what constitutes White every day. Best example of this: They are constantly claiming some Blacks as White or Middle Eastern but if we try to point out that Whites and Middle Easterners are just as mixed with Black we get shot down. Everyone can look at Italians and Jews and Middle Easterns and see some black features but this is heartily denied while the same people will insist that East Africans cannot be completely pure African. So Italians found their way to African but Africans could not have found their way to Italy. It's a sad double standard. Africa is being erased from history and you are very astute to notice this. Well, it really doesn't take being astute, just being willing to see Black people as the kings and queens we once were and will be again. I am noticing too that there is an unwillingness to give Africans credit for their contributions from the biggest thing (denial of Pharoahs being Black) to the smallest things (dreadlocs have become an European invention and every Disney princess but the black one was allowed to be princesses in their country of origin). Mulan, Pocahontas, Cinderella, were all princesses in their respective countries. But not the upcoming Princess Tiana who is a princess in Louisiana. Not African princesses allowed which is incredibly offensive. There are tons of ancient royalty they could have chosen from. <br>  <br>  1st This might seem like a small thing but it's quite significant. It's indicative of an overall belief that Africa has no culture, had no royalty, Africa has always been a cesspool. That's not even true today. Native Americans, Asians, Europeans have all been given a certain allure and the credit their ancient civilations deserve but there is still an idea that Blacks have been benefited by slavery. But why are black people being denied credit? It takes the guilt out of slavery for White people basically. If they acknowledge that Africa was once a prosperous, successful and diverse continent run by Black people (the same people they have degraded and placed below themselves) they would have to admit they did something truly horrible. Sure slavery was horrible blah blah blah but they can tell themselves in the back of their mind that at least Africans aren't in that horrible place anymore so in a way they did us a FAVOR.<br>  <br>  2nd Also there is another reason. There is still extreme prejudice against everything Black. This creates a two fold behavior within white people. We are forbidden, our creations are forbidden so they become cool. BUT they want to still be accepted so they try to have their cake and eat it too by rocking Black creations but "white washing" them by saying that White people created them. This way they get the cool factor by being LIKE black people but they can rationalize it by saying that Black people didn't really create it. "That's an urban myth" they can tell themselves.<br>  <br>  3rd The last reason I have noticed is still that there is racism and becuase Black people are not the top of our society today they must NEVER have been on top. I see this when someone says that Cleopatra was not a black woman. They inevitably follow up this statement with some racism like "Yeah, right like Cleopatra was Shaniqua and had braids." They are incapable of seeing modern black people as royalty and can't see past their prejudice.<br>  <br>  And then anyone who has brain cells and has noticed this gradual erasement and downplaying of African contributions and creations is labeled "Afrocentric." We don't get any credibility becuase we are "crazy". I guess seeing the obvious became being Afrocentric. Whatever, we know the truth but it makes me sad to see all these black children walking around unaware with their heritage and believing Eurocentric lies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sarcastic Zombie Nine: "Black people must have wide flat noses, ebony skin and big lips. Anything else is a White person. This should be obvious to everyone. You might be tempted to ask why White people are allowed to have such diversity without being called racially mixed. This is not a wise question to ask. That question is too logical of course and has no place in this discussion. Also the Saharan desert seperated North African and Sub saharan Africa like an impenetrable wall. This is so clear to me now. But of course the Mediterranian and Red sea and Cacuasas and Alpine Mountains were no match for White people and Middle Eastern people and Semitic people to find their way to Africa. Everyone knows Sub Saharan Africans are allergic to sand and wouldn't have the technology (ie camels) to cross this impenetrable ocean of sand. They would be repelled. Of course Middle Eastern people are Cuacasion. That makes so much sense considering how close they are to Europe and also Middle Easterns intermingled extensively with East African like Somalians but this micegenation does not work the other way. Do not every call a Middle Eastern an African, that would be wrong. All the Middle Easterners accomplished makes sense now. All along they were White people. They are clearly very similiar to White people in looks and very close to Europe. Oh wait, they aren't anywhere near Europe. And Mediterranians do kind of look like modern day mixed people with African admixture. Oh well, it's best not to think about it too much. White people have it under control. They understand these things better than you or I. Of course Egyptians were White. <br>  How silly of me to think otherwise. How could Black people create an empire? Everyone is part of the almighty white race. They are everyone and everyone is them (when it comes to successful things of course). I am so glad I stopped trying to fight the inevitable."|`|R3TzcZu8aa	I am surprised you have no tried to steal English history or Chinese history.

They can argue about an improvable issue - like "how many angels can dance on the head of a pin."|`|pfke6Jieaa	because they are NOT. end of story.|`|6yGY8QPsaa	Okay, since so many people here know nothing about what they're talking about, let me try and educate you people.  First off, the Ancient Egyptians were Caucasians.  Although they were Caucasian, however, that does not mean that they were "white" in the modern sense.  The words "Caucasian" and "white" are not synonyms.  Secondly, you people don't understand this basic fact:<br>  <br>  RACE HAS ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO DO WITH SKIN COLOR. <br>  <br>  Race is a sub-species classification used in anthropology and biology to categorize organisms that share similar genetic and physical traits within the same species. Racial classifications are based upon anthropology, most notably facial features and the shape of the skull - not skin color. People can be of very different skin color, and yet be categorized in the same racial group based on similar facial features.<br>  <br>  "Caucasian" is a racial classification that means anyone of European, North African, Persian (modern-day Iran), and Indian ancestry. The term "Caucasian" is synonymous with the word "Japhetic". Caucasians are characterized by a vertical forehead; a slender, protruding nose; and soft cascading hair. This is in contrast to the Semitic Race (Jews, Arabs, Turkic peoples), which are characterized by a receding forehead; a prominent, hooked nose; and more rigid hair. The Hamitic Race (sub-Saharan Africans and native Australians) are characterized by a wide, flat nose; large jawbone; and very rigid hair. (One side note: In case you don't know, Turkic peoples live in countries such as Turkey, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Afghanistan, Kyrgyzstan, Azerbaijan, etc. A large group - the Tatars - live in Eastern parts of Russia)<br>  <br>  The etymology of the word "Caucasian" is derived from the Caucusus Mountains, a mountain range stretching from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea. This geographic location is where many scientists and historians believe that the first Caucasian people, the Aryans, have originated. The Aryans migrated into Europe and North Africa in the first wave of migration, and then later to modern-day Iran and India in a second wave of migration. In India, they displaced the original inhabitants (the Dravidians), much the same way that Europeans displaced Amerindian populations in North America. Many historians believe that the Hindu caste system evolved to its current rigid status because the Aryans wanted to retain political superiority over the native Dravidians, who were assigned to lower social castes. According to the World Factbook, approximately 70% of India's population today is Indo-Aryan, while 30% is Dravidian. However, these figures are not concrete because large-scale miscegenation occurred since the Aryan invasion, which took place between 1700-1300 B.C.E., despite the formation of the caste system. (As a side note, It is important to note that some people choose not to use the word "Aryans" because of its connotations with Nazism and Nazi ideology. Instead, people commonly use the more politically correct term "Indo-Europeans"; such as "Indo-European" language groups, etc.). In short, people from Europe, North Africa, Iran, Pakistan, and India all share a common ancestor - a group of people who lived in the Caucusus Mountains many years ago.<br>  <br>  Regarding Northern Africa, it is important to note this in regards to historical contexts, not modern ones. Someone of North African origin today would not be Caucasian, which I will explain. The area known as the Maghreb (which in Arabic literally means "Western") - modern-day Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Mali, etc. were originally inhabited by a group of people known as Berbers. The Berbers were a Caucasian people, along with the ancient Egyptians. Although they had very dark skin tones, they are classified as Caucasians because of their facial features (which goes back to my point earlier that race has nothing to do with skin color). The Arabs (who are Semitic) invaded Egypt and North Africa beginning in the 7th century C.E., where they displaced the native Berber and Egyptian populations. In modern-day Egypt, for example, Arabs constitute roughly 90% of the total population. The native Egyptians (today known as Coptic people or Copts), represent only 10% of the total population. That is why most people from North Africa today are not Caucasian, since most of the inhabitants today are Arabs.<br>  <br>  The term "white" is a modern term that people use to connote someone of European ancestry. Its etymology is descriptive of European peoples' pale skin pigmentation. It is not a racial categorization and has no anthropological or biological significance. Therefore, "white" is not a race. Also, it is not synonymous with "Caucasian" because Europeans are just one group of Caucasian peoples.<br>  <br>  People misuse words all the time. For example, the word "anti-Semitism" means hatred against all Semitic peoples. Jews are just one group of Semitic peoples. It became popular in modern usage to mean hatred against Jews because the Jews were the only Semitic people living in Europe during the 19th Century, when the word first became used. And yet another example, people often say something along the lines of "We all belong to one race: the human race." This also is wrong. We all belong to one species, not one race. The word "human" is synonymous with "Homo-Sapien" - which is the name of the species that we belong to. Race, as I mentioned, is a sub-species classification. <br>  <br>  Also, "Hispanic" is not a race, as most people believe. The term "Hispanic" simply means anyone of Latin American national origin, who may be of any racial group. For example, there are many Caucasian Hispanics - such as most people from Argentina. Likewise, there are many Hamitic Hispanics, such as many people from Jamaica.|`|4yq5ZrCDaa	Because of ignorance. People don't think that Black Africans are capable of being smart like the ancient Egyptians. <br>  <br>  What bothers me about this is that Sudan is only about an hour away from Egypt.

JPCZCPE1aa	Rape fantasy is the most common fantasy for women. Often the things people fantasize about are those which are the most unacceptable in real life. It has been recorded that many jewish women suffer from terrible guilt because they fantasize about having sex in a concentration camp style setting and many black women suffer the same thing because they fantasize about being slaves.<br>  <br>  The important thing to realise is that everyone does this, it does not mean you actually want to be raped. As other posters have said: you would most likely find it very unpleasant.<br>  <br>  Perhaps part of the cause of your fantasy is because if you were being raped then you would not be responsible for your actions and thus would be able to relax and enjoy the experience without wondering if this was the right thing to do if he/she is the right person etc etc.<br>  <br>  One of the reason some people enjoy submitting in bondage play is that being tied up means that you are free of responsibility in the situation and so can relax more.<br>  <br>  My advice: enjoy your fantasies don't worry about trying to subdue it but realizese that the content of your fantasies seldom reflects your true desires.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|x4LYGAIkaa	Whoa! Rape is something you shouldn't want. I also know a few people who have this desire, the thing is, they usually imagine the rapist as some handsome devil---psh, in a thousand years. Do you really want some balding beer-belly rubbing his sweaty skin all over you? Fantasy is okay, maybe it can help you relieve your urges, but be careful not to make it a reality--don't get too carried away. Talk about raging hormones! If your into brutal passion you could read some de Sade, Venus in Furs, or something. It's better to relieve yourself in safety than to actually put yourself in danger--you seem to cherish yourself enough to not go out and risk yourself. It's actually not considered rape if you consent. If you ever find that one person, you could do some role playing--just don't forget the safety word. But seriously, once it's actually encounter a rape situation, it's something you won't want. There's a difference from wanting to be forced to have sex and actually being forced against your freewill.|`|a1hevOG2aa	As bad as this sounds, you're just a horny teenager.

This is a common misconception, we do not have a sexual quota to meet and get pent up if we don't and this applies to both men and women. If I were you I would stop focusing so much on when your going to loose your virginity and who is going to meet up to your standard for doing so. If you just let yourself relax and stop worrying about it I'm sure these fantasies which would definitely be unhealthy to live out but are not damaging to have will slowly melt into a fantasy of a safe and healthy experience with someone special. They are probably born of anxiety and a desire to just, get it over with or to stop limiting yourself.|`|wdYJqrnHaa	depends if you like guys or girls or both but if you want subdue it make the sex uncomfortable or watch movies about murder rape you might postpone the rape aspect.   <br>  <br>  Oh and if you decide on some sort gang sex make sure to use protection or have them checked for disease.|`|TcW0LHLAaa	Acknowledge your feelings and think about how it makes you feel and why.

AA11598520	Well, the physical body wouldn't exist if not for life, so I guess I believe in #1. I believe that one can have life without a physical body, so I don't agree with #2.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Erm, two, I think. Because the physical body IS life. Or life is the physical body. There's no entity that is "life", which forms a physical body around itself. Life is nothing more than a series of interesting chemical reactions, when you get right down to it, and those chemical reactions are happening inside the crucible of the physical body. Forming that crucible, as the crucible forms the reaction.|`|D9lMg7A2aa	I have to go with what I think Aristotle would say, and say '1'. <br>  <br>  I am not a reductionist.

Considering that I believe that life begins at conception, it's more than just the physical body, because the human body, while in the womb is living, although dependent on the mother to survive. <br>  <br>  At the same point, I believe that the soul is necessary for survival, and when it departs the body, the soul lives on for eternity. The body is merely the shell.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	Oh, no -- you're forcing me uncomfortably close to philosophy, you know.<br>  <br>  Time passes...<br>  <br>  I can't, for this one reason: They are not independent.

DltwBpMCaa	I think a fancy casino theme for the James Bond theme.<br>  Dress code: men in suits, women in dresses.<br>  <br>  Drinks:<br>  I like the idea about the sparkling cider, and I'd suggest you get someone to be like a kind of waiter, the people who hold the champagne glasses on trays going round offering people or if you can get a home bar or borrow one, if not the tray thing would do. And if its a James Bond theme, you should have the 2 main drinks - Vodka martini, shaken not stirred and also champagne but anything in the champagne glasses would do as long as its sparkling.<br>  <br>  Entertainment:<br>  Plan your music in advance, by mixing a tape or burning a CD - a good start would be the James Bond theme songs, but other period music can also work well. Don't forget that you can also buy cover versions of all the Bond songs, so you don't only have to play the originals.<br>  If you go for the casino theme, roulettes a must - you can buy cheap table top roulettes, and how about providing chocolate casino chips or normal plastic casino chips to guests. And you could set up poker/blackjack, all you need is a table and deck of cards, simple!<br>  Of course, don't forget a James Bond quiz!<br>  <br>  Decorations:<br>  Just black and white stuff, black + white balloons, maybe a few casino cut out posters. You can also get life size silhouette spies.<br>  <br>  It will all just flow, relax, everyone will be chatting and having a drink, you don't actually need a quiz or casino but if you want you can<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Table top roulette - <a href="http://www.gamesonboard.co.uk/p/casino/5%22+Roulette+Set/189/1178" rel="nofollow">http://www.gamesonboard.co.uk/p/casino/5...</a><br>  Chocolate poker chips - <a href="http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse/processRequest.do?demandPrefix=12&sku=/K1022&mode=Searching&erec=1&D=casino+chips&Ntt=casino+chips&Ntk=all&Dx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&Ntx=mode%2bmatchallpartial&N=0&requestURI=processProductsCatalog&sd=Double+Crisp%26%23174%3B+Chocolate+Poker+Chips" rel="nofollow">http://www.orientaltrading.com/ui/browse...</a>|`|t2LOcPkLaa	Perhaps you should make it formal? Bond is always wearing a suit after all and I'm sure girls wouldn't mind dressing up. Or at least cocktail attire? I'd say make it fancy. Perhaps it could be casino themed? Sparkling cider is a great idea & you can get those plastic glasses at Party City or you can go to a thrift store and pick up some real glasses for cheap (works out great if you only need a few or if you don't mind them not matching perfectly). You could have one of the movies playing on mute in the background. And you should make a cd of the most popular Bond songs! You could play a Bond trivia game (I'm sure they make one somewhere). You could play that party game where you put a name on everyone's back (use characters from Bond movies) and they ask other people questions to try to find out who they are.

Sometimes it is a good thing but when it gets to the point that you can't admit you're wrong and apologize or accept someone/something, then its a character flaw.|`|coPtU10Laa	Being persistent isn't a character flaw neither is being true to ones own beliefs. Stubborn goes beyond either of these and suggest doing something even if we know it isn't correct because it's what we want to do. Or refusing to accept that we could be wrong and yes this is a bad thing. stubborn people refuse to even consider others opinion. People on the other hand wrongly accuse others of being stubborn just because they don't share the opinion. you can disagree on a subject and still not be stubborn if you have Truly listened to others arguments and just don't agree with their conclusion.

Yet, in their doing so, they do what Christ taught us not to do. That is, judge others.     Nonetheless, what others think does not really matter to me.  What Christ thinks does.

Next time you drive past one of their places of worship, look at the signage they use to advertise their wares. It says, "The Church of JESUS CHRIST and Latter Day Saints." The 'JESUS CHRIST' is put in large bold lettering to reinforce the claim that Mormonism is Christian. But it's not; their doctrine is based on the lies of a 19th century con artist called Joe Smith. He believed his hat told him things and he managed to convince people that he found golden plates with another revelation from the Christian god on them. No one else ever saw the plates.

As in, we live what we believe.  We don't go to Church on Sunday and live a lie the rest of the week.  We strive to live what we believe everyday.  Such as being honest, being physically clean, living morally clean lives and giving service to our fellow man.  We don't just preach it, we live it.  There are so many good people in our Church they inspire the rest of us to become better ourselves.

This is absurd and FALSE DOCTRINE! And JOSEPH SMITH IS A FALSE PROPHET WHO HAS DECEIVED MANY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... :(<br>  And ask yourself this. If they are truly "Christian" the way they "claim", why do they believe in "becoming Gods" (Satan's 1st lie to Eve in the Garden of Eden), why do they believe that salvation can ONLY be had through Joseph Smith (when salvation can ONLY be had through the Lord Jesus Christ, as it is written), and why are their "temple services" pagan (performing baptisms for the dead and the like when this is CLEARLY outlawed in the bible?) <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd say don't just walk away from the "Mormon(s)" trying to convert you, RUN!

"Love your neighbor as yourself, and love the Lord Your God with all your mind, with all your might, with all your soul, and with all your heart." If we do that then all His "ideas" will be done.

Although Harry Potter seems more realistic to me.|`|XkrHDiClaa	Your question is a result of misleading factors.<br>  <br>  The answer is "If you don't ACCEPT Jesus, you are going to hell."<br>  <br>  I can understand why you typed it this way, however.  In this day and time 'wording' has become distorted.  This was initiated by Satan (ref. Garden of Eden).  If you read the bible about Jesus' journey, you will see that he encountered demon who knew he was the son of God.  They believed who he was, and they are demons - so of course they are going to hell (if not there already).  Be informed, there will come a time when everyone has encountered the word of God and will have made their choice; Accept him or Reject him.<br>  <br>  Everyone and every religion may have their different views on him, but the previously-mentioned choices still apply.<br>  <br>  If they accept him as their saviour then belief if a by-product of that acceptance.  If they reject him, then - though they may believe who he is - they just don't want him as part of their life...  like the demon spirits.<br>  <br>  I've met Atheists who believe who God and Jesus are, but chose simply to reject the words.  That was their choice, which is opposite of the choice I made.<br>  <br>  And you know what?  As human beings, I don't look at them any different.  They know they can come to me if they have an opinion or question about the bible.|`|znt2s3sMaa	Yes, they will go to Hell if they don't believe.   It does not matter how many good things you do-it won't get you into Heaven.  Only the belief in Jesus will.

Prophets like Moses, Isaiah and Jeremiah preached about Him before He was born.|`|t88527U1aa	Ever hear of Missionaries that is why they are out preaching the gospel so men are without excuse.

Next, you're obviously intelligent and you're apparently wondering how such tenets can be reconciled with God's love and mercy.<br>  <br>  Short answer: They can't, and you're right.<br>  <br>  Better answer: Of course God is going to give all of his children a fair chance.|`|FOzN3xwzaa	Nobody gets into heaven without having believed in Jesus alone for salvation.<br>  <br>  We're all sinners. Only JESUS is acceptable payment for sins. All the good deeds in the world won't pay for even one of a person's sins. <br>  <br>  Either Jesus pays for a person's sins, or that person pays for their sins in eternal torment in hell. That is the choice before everyone. <br>  <br>  Salvation is a FREE GIFT that happens in a split second when you believe in Jesus! It is impossible to lose or "leave" salvation (John 6:39-40, 1 John 5:13). <br>  <br>  The truth about Jesus is that the only way to be saved and to get into heaven and avoid being sent to eternal hell, is by believing in faith alone that Jesus, who is God, died for our sins on the cross as FULL PAYMENT for all our sins, and then Jesus rose from the dead (1 Corinthians 15:1-4). Believe this and you will be in heaven, no matter what! <br>  <br>  Please pray now: "Jesus, please forgive me of my sins. I believe that You died on the cross for my sins and You rose from the dead. Thank You for eternal life!" You will be in heaven with Him forever when you die. :)|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Chris said it right!|`|5shqstYraa	Revelation 5:9 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation;<br>  Revelation 14:6 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and people,|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	Just exactly who is this 'they' you are referring to?<br>  The world is full -- FULL -- of religious and spiritual people who do not believe in Jesus as their personal savior (and who are not diss-ing him either!) -- Jews and Muslims as you have noted and Hindus to name another large and non-Christian group AND all of these religious, spiritual people believe in some sort of (positive) afterlife.<br>  It is more than a shame that some people are so narrow-minded and dogmatic -- and frankly, incredibly egocentric, to think that their 'way' is the only way.

But everyones going to have a chance to know who Jesus issss AND to accept Jesus as their saviour before God come to take his people but if they don't then they will have their own account on judgement day.

LOL LOL LOL|`|9f5169159afb1c45757aaedd7e065b7caa	I found this article   <a href="http://www.gotquestions.org/never-heard.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gotquestions.org/never-heard....</a><br>  <br>  There is more information at the website.  <br>  <br>   All people are accountable to God whether they have “heard about Him” or not. The Bible tells us that God has clearly revealed Himself in nature (Romans 1:20) and in the hearts of people (Ecclesiastes 3:11). The problem is that the human race is sinful; we all reject this knowledge of God and rebel against Him (Romans 1:21-23). Apart from God's grace, God would give us over to the sinful desires of our hearts, allowing us to discover how useless and miserable life is apart from Him. This He does for those who reject Him (Romans 1:24-32).<br>  <br>  In reality, it is not that some people have not heard about God. Rather, the problem is that they have rejected what they have heard and what is readily seen in nature. Deuteronomy 4:29 proclaims, “But if from there you seek the LORD your God, you will find him if you look for him with all your heart and with all your soul.” This verse teaches an important principle—everyone who truly seeks after God will find Him. If a person truly desires to know God, God will make Himself known.<br>  <br>  The problem is, “there is no one who understands, no one who seeks God” (Romans 3:11). People reject the knowledge of God that is present in nature and in their own hearts, and instead decide to worship a “god” of their own creation. It is foolish to debate the fairness of God sending someone to hell who never had the opportunity to hear the Gospel of Christ. People are responsible to God for what God has already revealed to them. The Bible says that people reject this knowledge, and therefore God is just in condemning them to hell.|`|zkovxRseaa	i believe in jesus, he's real, he trims my bushes and mows my lawn, he's a good worker|`|D9lMg7A2aa	You go to Hell if it is your fault you don't know.

Does this suggest a certain course of action?  Does it make you feel any better?<br>  <br>  Maybe you can find some solace in the idea that if he is testing you, your suffering will eventually end and you'll be rewarded eternally.  Can you really believe that strongly enough that it will serve as a bulwark and balm against all of the misfortune that life throws at you?<br>  <br>  The fact that you're asking this question tells me that you have some doubt.  You want to believe there is some purpose to your suffering, but you're not sure that view is justified.  Maybe a part of you feels that even if there is a purpose to your suffering, that you'll never understand what it is, and perhaps some dark part of your psyche that you'd prefer not to confront holds the agent responsible (god) in contempt for subjecting you to needless suffering.  <br>  <br>  I can't tell you what to believe, but I would encourage you to explore your feelings and to confront your beliefs and doubts honestly, keeping in mind what you really, practically think has the best chance of allowing you to cope with the difficulties of life.<br>  <br>  One thing to consider is that if you believe you are being tested by god, is there a chance that you might be more prone to blow your negative experiences out of proportion?<br>  <br>  I know that I personally became a happier person after I stopped trying to reconcile the events of my life with what I had been taught about god.  Others claim to have had the opposite experience (that being schooled in the nature of god showed them a path to worldly happiness).  You have to decide for yourself what is right, but if you care to hear more about my perspective and how I'd personally deal with your situation (or if you just want to vent), feel free to drop me a line.

God isn't in a big hurry and rushing your progress only makes the progress flawed.<br>  <br>  If possible keep a journal; nothing big, but write down general events of the day, how it made you feel and so on.<br>  <br>  then in six months go over your notes and see how you've changed.

This is incorrect. And also, God may be testing us in our daily lives, but I doubt two men commenting on your physical appearance has anything to do with that. How is your self-esteem? If you realised that you were a child of God then you wouldn't have to worry about what other people had to say as far as your appearance goes. <br>  <br>  The verse about God's testing:<br>  <br>  James 1:12<br>   Blessed is the man who perseveres under trial because when he has stood the test he will reecive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.<br>  <br>  The verse against the idea that God tempts us:<br>  <br>  James 1:13<br>  <br>  When tempted, no one should say "God is tempting me." For God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone, but each one is tempted when, by his own evil desire, he is dragged away and enticed. <br>  James 1:16<br>  Don't be deceived my dear brothers. Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <br>  <br>  Keep your head up but don't be so quick to blame God.|`|t8JlnuqFaa	Why do bad things happen to good people? That is one of the difficult questions in all of theology. God is eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, omnipotent, etc. Why should we human beings (not eternal, infinite, omniscient, omnipresent, or omnipotent) expect to be able to fully understand God’s ways? The book of Job deals with this issue. <br>  <br>  God had allowed Satan to do everything he wanted to Job except kill him. What was Job’s reaction? “Though he slay me, yet will I hope in him” (Job 13:15). “The LORD gave and the LORD has taken away; may the name of the LORD be praised” (Job 1:21). Job didn’t understand why God had allowed the things He did, but he knew that God was good and therefore continued to trust in Him. Ultimately, that should be our reaction as well. God is good, just, loving, and merciful. Often things happen to us that we simply cannot understand. <br>  <br>  However, instead of doubting God's goodness, our reaction should be to trust Him. "Trust in the LORD with all your heart and lean not on your own understanding; in all your ways acknowledge Him, and He will make your paths straight" (Proverbs 3:5-6).|`|wFjLeulXaa	hey you were made in his image so you can't be ugly.You have to understand that God loves you and thinks that you are beautiful before you can ever except yourself.What do you think God is thinking when you put yourself down?He's not agreeing with you I can tell you that much.Some people are just jerks and can't see the beauty God put in all of his Creations.Or some are to proud to admit it.Life will get hard but that is when I challenge you to hold on and show your loyalty to God. God Bless you and I wish you the best of luck.Be assured you will be in my prayers tonight.God loves you so you have no reason to not love yourself.I urge you to pray and to put your burdens on God.

Regardless how mean they are, they too have family, friends and acquaintances in their life. <br>  <br>  Who love them just as they are, even if yourself or others don't. Just because a person disagrees with a person. Doesn't mean it's right to end their life, no matter how mean or bad the person is.<br>  <br>  Yes I do feel sympathy for murder victims, as any loss of life before their time is a sad event. I also feel sympathy for a person who was driven by cruelness and ill treatment towards them. To think murder was the only way to stop a person continuing their ill treatment towards them. <br>  <br>  Being murder is not the answer, they need to speak out, to someone who will listen and help them, to stop people like this and let the law deal with them.

P7phsL52aa	Good job on accepting who you are.<br>  <br>  No matter what anyone says, being gay is NOT wrong. People who say so, were brought up to think that. They're weak human beings that allow society to feed them lies and their brains get degraded. I understand where you're going with your parents, the fact that they talk badly about being gay. When at first, if they don't accept who you are, wait and see if they can change their mind and love you for who you are. If they still don't, move out when you're old enough. No one deserves this from their parents, though many people do face this situation. In the end, it's not about your parents anymore, it's about you. <br>  <br>  Kids these days are immature, and too, are fed the lies from society. Do NOT let anyone bring you down and make you feel disgusting for being gay. Being gay is just as normal as someone who is straight. Love not knows anything but love itself. <br>  <br>  I'm sure you are a great person, and I hope things go swell for you.|`|FgaBo4Eraa	It's good, same as any other sexuality really (I'm bi)<br>  <br>  I didn't know my sexuality at 13, I was essentially Asexual until 16 so meh. trouble with realising early is that you will face more discrimination than coming out later in life.

HOPE I HELPED!!|`|a1hevOG2aa	Congrats on being able to accept yourself.  Even though you're afraid of your family and friends' reactions, which is normal, it's good that you are content with yourself.  With me, I was pretty young too when I knew pretty much for sure that my interests didn't lie with men.  Actually, I was 11 the first time I came out to my mom.  She disregarded it and said that I didn't know what I was talking about, so I ended up suppressing it.  This caused it to come out in other ways, like when I was 12 and i shaved my head and didn't grow it back for about a year and a half.  A few years later when I was 14 I told her that I was a lesbian and that she had two choices, deal with it or lose a daughter.  She kicked me out later on, but we're getting better now.  What I think about LGBT is that we are really nice people for the most part, and unfortunately a lot of other people miss out on seeing that because they are afraid of something or someone that's different.  Another unfortunate thing is that we get bad publicity quite often, because we're just like everyone else, our culture has some people who don't carry themselves with dignity, and sadly those are the ones that make the most noise making us all look bad.  <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to tell your parents, but only when you're ready, and they may take it hard, but they'll learn that you are still their son that they can't help but love.  And with friends, the ones worth keeping are the ones that stand by you, the others were never really your friend.|`|wdYJqrnHaa	I'm 16 and bi I've told people but they all think i'm joking my opinion on this is that if there is love why cut your chances in half accept everyone FYI I have nothing against the gay or the lesbian.

There are enough straight women out there and they need to go find one of them.|`|bmo2aGbdaa	Yes, you have a snowball's chance in h3ll.  Just because a woman looks hot to you doesn't mean she has any desire to spend time with you.<br>  <br>  With an ego like yours, many straight women must run in terror from you.|`|0f7ba60c4b5854ac551f8222ad3afdf1aa	No. They're LESBIANS.|`|gt5mEVOuaa	Really?

There was this woman, I used to know and I thought she was the ant's pants (it's a saying for hot).<br>  <br>  Then there was the story of the water in the oceans and the sunlight reflecting off it, gives us the colour blue. Someone has mentioned it here as well.<br>  <br>  BUT .... I have a better reason. This woman, the sunshine came out of her butt. So we have the reflection onto the water and up into the sky.<br>  <br>  Simple.

And, oh yeah, because Chuck Norris said so, like she said!|`|MDgVPwU3aa	Because it really isn't a color|`|vlVdn5GFaa	cause if it was red they would think hell is up instead of down.|`|R1eten5Haa	Cause God made it that way. :-)|`|0sv7UnCMaa	hmm thats a good one i dont know srry|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Why make it up?<br>  <br>  The sky is blue because the light is refracted by the air to a specific wavelength that we perceive as blue.|`|iTi26ojQaa	because it's Chuck Norris's favorite color, DUHH!
4maV4O1aaa	Go with something you are passionate about, and familiar with, so you don't get nervous.  What are your personal interests?  For example, I enjoy doing genealogy research - so, for a speech class I had, I talked about how to get started in researching your family tree.  You might have a hobby or interest that you can "inform" your audience about for 5 minutes.  Is there a local issue in your town or city (historic buildings, development, jobs, economic, etc.) that's important to you?  Are you involved in your community somehow that you could talk about (choir, volunteering, etc.)?  What do you enjoy (knitting, birdwatching, scrapbooking, writing, etc.)?  Find an aspect of something you are involved in or familiar with and make your presentation about that.  <br>  <br>  If you try to do talk about something that is unfamiliar to you, not only will you have to do extensive research but, you would be more prone to being nervous about it and going blank. You'll be more comfortable and confident if presenting something familiar.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!

oE0ApHqPaa	I'm hetero, but I have serious skills with reading body language, so I can usually tell.  I have been wrong before, but I'm spot on probably 95% of the time.  I think that some people base it on a set of stereotypical behaviors and appearances, but anyone with half a brain knows that appearances can be deceiving.  <br>  <br>  People that are bi can be confusing, though.  Sometimes they read as straight, and sometimes their body language is super complex.|`|u8CFwtyMaa	If anyone knows, please please please please tell me!!!!!!!|`|6ELSwKKvaa	Gaydar isn't real, however there are people who have become skilled in reading the signs of someone who is homosexual. Using terms like "Significant other" tend to set off some gadar bells. There are also people who attempt to show they are gay in how they dress or act, which can also set off gaydar but has been known to sometimes give false results.<br>  <br>    The reason why gadar doesn't always work is because there are some people in this world who work very hard to hide their sexuality and those people will slip under the gaydar most times. There are also some heterosexual people who just don't fit what the world considers the norm and they might falsely set off the gadar.<br>  <br>   So, while having a certain amount of gadar skills is helpful it is never foolproof. The only way to really know if someone is gay is to ask them.|`|hZiwiboRaa	People with 'Gaydar' somehow concentrate on body language a lot more than average people. That's how they know if someone is gay or not, but it's still pretty un-predictable if you ask me.|`|HOQp0gA7aa	Yes.  First they offer to put your sexual organs in their mouth.  If you keep them there until you achieve "enlightenment", then their "Gaydar" sense lets them know you are gay.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|wRuWQA8Yaa	well I'm not gay, but I have almost impeccable "gaydar", so I'm assuming others might too.|`|ig6qg2R4aa	It's kind of just this aura that some people give off, so, if we figure out the person is gay, we can say "I totally called it first!!!"|`|7LJRbfGHaa	I don't believe in "gaydar". Gay people, like all people, come in all shapes, sizes, colors, whatever. I will admit that there are some us that are more stereotypical gays that probably would be easier to guess, but then there are also a lot of guys that you would never even know just by looking at them or talking to them. There's just too much of a variety to be able to have a consistent and definitive perceptiveness, called "gaydar".  For example you have your effeminate queens on one end of the spectrum and on the other end you have your hyper-masculine hairy macho guys it just isn't pragmatic for anyone to have actual "gaydar".|`|6rHhrcWGaa	not unless theyre obviously flaming on fire gay XD<br>  <br>  I have a horrible gaydar =[<br>  but at disneyland I can pick them ALL out XD|`|ZfV2PDhWaa	lol maybe sometimes but not always = /|`|tVUBqdSzaa	mine is broken at the moment.<br>  lol just joking, no i don't know if someone else is gay, speaking for myself.|`|i8cFHtUzaa	hah, no. <br>  they just say that because it's funny.|`|grYkoDaraa	well i'm gay and my "gaydar" absolutely sucks.  like really bad.|`|xUCXXb73aa	i don't think so|`|ye1muYCfaa	i wish lol|`|iP8TRjXraa	Some times, yes, as it as been proved a few times.|`|z5bImY4waa	no you can't...well not well anyways|`|Z7dShLRLaa	Yea i have gaydar.<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  I can spot a gay a mile away.<br>  <br>  That ryhmed XD|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	no.<br>  are u gay?|`|gWJqarq8aa	well i base my 'gaydar' on body language and it works most of the time but it has failed before...lol

INJSpV4haa	There's nothing wrong with your desires, or with your fetishes. Many peoole have the same type of fantasies, and a fetish for feet is the second most common fetish in the world (right after a fetish for breasts).<br>  <br>  Your only problem is your age. You will have to be patient until you are over the age of concent, before you can start trying out your fantasies.<br>  <br>  In the meantime, try to relax and concentrate on your studies.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|30da49ce7350d87aa6b90301d5bc7940aa	Technically "fetishism" is erotic response to inanimate objects, erotic response to a specific body part, like the feet, is "partialism".  Leaving that aside what you're feeling is considered by the psychiatric community to be normal as long as it doesn't interfere with your ability to function in non-sexual situations, like at school or church, so there's nothing for you to be worried about on that score.  This is also true about sexual submissiveness, but at your age, like homosexuality, it is widely considered socially unacceptable for you to experiment so I recommend you wait until you are old enough to leave home and start building a life of your own.  Roughly 15% of the people in the U.S. are into alternative sexualities, that's well over 30 million people, so you're hardly alone and once you are able to start exploring you shouldn't have any trouble finding people with whom you can build the kind of relationship you desire, just take your time, you're young and you have it.  Good luck.|`|hZiwiboRaa	She's a girl not a women at 15.<br>  I've never understood why people like feet so much.. Weird.<br>  <br>  I guess you'll have to wait for other answer i'm repulsed by feet so don't ask me lol|`|paRGbr7Xaa	You're not weird, you're just into D/s and feet. D/s is something interesting and wonderful when you're with the right person. You're young so there's no need to tell anyone about it unless you decide to enter into a committed intimate relationship (which might not happen for a long time).|`|uyX6VP2Yaa	your hilarious! it's weird.. but what ever u like is ur business.lol.|`|i8cFHtUzaa	I dunno, hun.<br>  <br>  I'm 17 and a lipstick lesbian, and I am absolutely repulsed by the thought of feet. When i first had sex with my current girl, she had ice cold feet and I kept moving my legs away from her and she kept trying to stick them under my legs to warm them up :/<br>  <br>  the domination thing isnt all that strange. Most of us have a preference to either being a "sub" or a "dom" (submissive or dominant) so that's probably why you like it. <br>  <br>  I dunno what to tell you about the feet though.<br>  i watched a video of a girl getting her toes sucked on by another girl and i wanted to throw up.<br>  But to each their own i guess.|`|Q5zdvZxraa	It's perfectly normal to have fetishes at a young age, its hormones kicking in as well. <br>  <br>  Everyone has their own preferences. And you have nothing to be ashamed of. But you really can't get rid of your feelings. If you don't want to be embarrassed then maybe you shouldnt talk about it much?|`|bFDeOXvYaa	It's not wrong, but wait until you turn 18 before trying to learn more.

Can you name one incident when a 'celebrity woman' has been publicly accused of domestic violence anyway? It could happen in theory but in practice, domestic violence is perpetrated by men in 9 out of 10 cases. It is often about asserting a stereotypical and brutish form of 'masculinity' which most normal, decent men reject but a few lunatics use against women.|`|D2trlpjzaa	ok um first of all chris is the one who hurt rhiana and so the split up but now they are getting back together and rhiana is still deciding if she should press charges on chris. also chris was supposed to go to jail but he was lucky. but there still is like both side of there lawyers involved|`|yY5AGLFHaa	Chris missed the awards.<br>  Rhiana is a celeb.<br>  Otherwise none of it would be on the news. <br>  Pain is pain when you take a punch.

XoNuUrYoaa	If the confirmation was unwillingly done, it means nothing.I feel for this girl.Although the priest could do nothing if she refused to be confirmed, she may have got hassle from her family about it.She probably felt pressure from her family to conform to the family's faith, so I would tread carefully lest you get blamed for causing her to "rebel".I guess by all the tears, her family have grasped her reluctance in the matter.|`|vUiUoamVaa	I deny the Catholic confirmation process - and the protestant also.  What HE taught has been SO diluted over time...wow, she is a a free thoughtful person.|`|KXQVRQdjaa	Those jerks.  The whole point of confirmation is that a child reaches the age of reason (able to make decisions for themselves), and they CONFIRM that they wish to remain in the Catholic church.  Choosing is the entire point of the sacrament!<br>  <br>  Remind her that if she doesn't feel Catholic, the Confirmation doesn't mean anything to her, because a non-Catholic doesn't believe in it and considers it a meaningless gesture.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, she probably would have been punished if she hadn't gone through with it.  Best of luck to her.  You're a good friend.|`|um9W8Dy8aa	I doubt the validity or at least the efficacy of that Confirmation: there was not faith and commitment to confirm|`|592517cb7a38eb4f9614445c37df538aaa	If she didn't mean her vows, her confirmation is invalidated. In other words, she's not really confirmed.<br>  <br>  I don't know exactly what consequences she would have faced from her parents, but the Church probably would have helped her out with that. You see, if she would have spoken with the priest privately and explained that she didn't want to be confirmed and had no intention of taking the vows in any meaningful way and was just doing this because Mom & Dad said, he might have actually gone to bat for her with Mom & Dad and told them it would be best for her to wait until she really wants to be confirmed. A priest is not supposed to confirm ANY person who doesn't wish it. <br>  <br>  Not knowing her parents, I couldn't say whether they would have been understanding or not. She also had a sponsor involved -- that person should have helped her out as well. <br>  <br>  I am a Catholic parent, but if any of my kids really didn't want to be confirmed, I would allow that child to wait under the condition that it's not just idle waiting but fact-finding and examining the situation to determine what he/she truly believes and how that fits in with Catholicism (or not).|`|AA10192697	Darn, she shouldn't have gone thru it. She should have told the teacher of the program, the priest or her parents. God at least knows.<br>  <br>  You don't have to make your confirmation until you are truly ready and willing.  Tell her to talk to the priest. Without it in her heart, it's not a true confirmation.  And she shouldn't be afraid. Several kids don't do it or do it a few yrs later. I personally think the ages for these sacraments are too young. <br>  <br>  Go with her to the priest or to tell her parents. And have her tell you want she wants to say to them. Have her practice on you so she will be able to stay focused when she tells her parents.  Just don't let her be alone in this.  You sound like a good friend.  <br>  <br>  Maybe after a few more years and a few Bible studies, she will be able to confirm her faith.  It's valid in the church but not in her heart and soul, so it's not valid with the Lord either.  He knows what she is thinking and feeling. This is a hard age to be.|`|AA11598520	When I taught in Catholic school, I did Confirmation prep many times. My colleagues and I often wished that more kids who weren't ready would admit it and not go through with it. Many of us felt that most of the kids--and their parents--didn't really understand what Confirmation was all about and were just going through the motions to get to the big party. I believe it is akin to you Baptists deciding whether or not you want to be baptized. It's a huge decision and should not be undertaken lightly.<br>  <br>  It is sad that this girl felt that she couldn't tell her parents or her teachers that she didn't want to be confirmed. No one should be forced to be confirmed if they don't want to be. If she changes her mind later, she could have been confirmed then. <br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it's necessary to "deny" her Confirmation since, really, one cannot receive a sacrament because they are being forced to. It's like going to confession and telling some sins but not mentioning that murder you just committed and then receiving absolution. Sure, you can fool a priest, but since God is doing the forgiving, and he knows what you did, you aren't really forgiven. It doesn't "take." Technically, since she was unwilling to be Confirmed but was forced into it, she wasn't really Confirmed. That doesn't mean she would have to do it over, but it means that it doesn't really count. <br>  <br>  If she can find a priest she is comfortable talking to about how she feels--and they aren't easy to find--I'm sure he could put her mind at ease. I wish that more kids would take it as seriously as she does. <br>  <br>  If I didn't make sense in this or if you have another question, you can contact me or try me at my 360. (Sometimes simply trying to send an email through YA doesn't work for some reason.) Good luck!|`|4args6jHaa	She should have talked to her family and her priest. Confirmation is an act where the person being confimed states that they agree with the faith and teachings of the catholic church.  This child obviously was not ready to be confirmed.  If I were her, I would go and speak to the priest.  Talk to him.  Some families are catholic more out of tradition then faith...and others are so dogmatically of the faith, that they forget that to question is ok.  Have her talk to her priest...if she's really too scared of her own priest, then she should go seek out another parish nearby if she can.|`|6sJhoXAAaa	That's the last big ceremony she had to do (Baptism, First Holy Communion, Confirmation).  She can be whatever she wants in her heart, and in 4 years she can convert, become an atheist or do whatever she wants.  I don't know why she shed so many tears over a short ceremony -- especially if her heart wasn't in it.<br>  That is if she isn't going to let her parents bully her into a Catholic wedding and Catholic Christenings for any children she might have later.|`|xelkbdbdaa	If that's what the young lady wanted, that was her right. Clearly, she is not Catholic. And, she should not have it forced on her. And, even though I am a non-denominational Christian, I would say that regardless of what she would convert to. I would hope she would choose my preference. But, I can't force it. Now, bear in mind that I'm speaking as an American. Other cultures might not be so lenient toward younger people.|`|stHol8ITaa	Of course she can deny it, you can't exactly grab someone and force them unless you want to risk been charged with assault.|`|AA10034051	Yes she could have all she had to do was to speak with her priest and then her parents.|`|qxteTM9Kaa	Sure,why not.She can also leave the Catholic Church if she so chooses.|`|P5Iq6nufaa	Some have already said this and they are correct. The Sacrament would have had not effect if it was performed unwillingly. Confirmation is the coming of the Holy Spirit unto a person. It is not for parents or anyone else to attempt to determine one's disposition in regards to the Sacrament. I feel terrible for this child; she is obviously going through a period of questioning her faith and she should be allowed to explore her faith without being bullied. If she expressed reservations to her priest or Bishop, she would not have been forced into the Sacrament, no matter what her parents said. Canon law supersedes parental wishes. She may, with God's grace, find her faith again but she will be guided as her heart sees true. I would hope she does, but she should not be forced into anything.|`|y6TbtvPoaa	She could have denied it and the only consequence would be from her parents. when you are confirmed you are suppose to be ready to be faithful to the church.

Lucifer's original purpose was apparently to illuminate.  He might have been a candidate for the office of Holy Ghost (or one of the spirits meant to fill that office, if more than one).

Hmm well I don't buy into most of these stereotypes for Americans but they are often depicted as ignorant because  a lot of the media in the US has exaggerated cultures and made them something they are not(eg: as i'm also aussie, I've had americans come up to me and ask if i have a pet kangaroo. we don't have kangaroos in suburbs..only the outback where mostly no-one lives---also we don't have that godaarn awful accent like Steve irwin's or that guy in crocodile dundee because they are mostly the outback accent as well).|`|rlEoPwjEaa	I dont even like guns.<br>  <br>  i like swords! yeeha!<br>  <br>  ( goes around cutting and stabbing random things! )|`|cb0dd8b109b614c488f7229846dbcd8faa	You have such ignorance in your words and you should start thinking before you speak. The person above me stated it in a nice way. We KNOW what Americans are. I think if we have the ability to read & type, it's a 99.9% chance that we know who or what Americans are.<br>  <br>  Not ONLY Americans are gun-lovers. Many other races also have interests in guns.<br>  <br>   There are many stereotypes that I hear but I can't get one right off the bat. This isn't a stereotype but I would possibly be able to say that they "look down" on other races. Especially foreigners and African-Americans. Look at what you just said: "----americans in here means USA citizen". THAT right there deserves a slap in the face.|`|axylPYftaa	i dont think give a sh*t

7LJRbfGHaa	Gay behavior? The only gay behavior is an attraction to the same sex. If you've seen having sexual interactions with another guy then the answer is obvious if not, then you're jumping to conclusions.|`|rsAqrbsgaa	Why do you care if he is gay or not?  It is none of your buisness.|`|Ji1DVABtaa	I don't mean to be mean, but why are you even concerned?  Your friend's sexuality is his business and nobody else's.  If he is gay and chooses to try a different path then that's his thing.  You need to stop obsessing on what his sexuality is either way.  It's not your business.  Just be a friend.|`|fWclxi9Baa	i doubt it i mean im 23 and never had a g/f i perfer not to have one more drama and fighting these are things i dont want in my life|`|7PHKYCKDaa	i would talk to him telll him you dont mind gay people lol but dont make assumptions=/|`|IGXE3aDraa	you should butt out of his life let him live how he chooses|`|7KAhcGPLaa	He might not be gay, so do not jump to conclusions. <br>  Homosexuality is a struggle just like lying or stealing is a struggle. So maybe he is just struggling with that desire, and he is doing good by not giving in to it. <br>  I'm not sure what this "strange behavior" is, but it might not necessarily mean he is gay. If it appears that way, try confronting him through an anonymous note or something (to avoid any violence) and urge him to change his behavior. <br>  Good luck!|`|HReDTDExaa	as sad as it is, maybe as a friend, you should step aside and let him do him. if u keep asking and he responds in that manner, then just stop asking. let him come to you, and as a religious person he should know that nobody is perfect, God made him the way he is. Remember people don't choose to be gay.|`|WQ9D8Qwlaa	I don't believe he's gay. Just because he has some erratic behavior doesn't mean he isn't straight. He might be religious because he was brought up that way. Sooner or later, he'll get a girlfriend and maybe get married. Don't try to judge other people and let him be the way he is.|`|mr4pB3xFaa	maybe the reason he takes it really violently is becuase he doesn't want to accept and make it public that he is, maybe he's thinking its just a stage that hes thinking he is, or liking other men.<br>  maybe he wants to keep his relationship/sex stuff personall, and not shared.<br>  <br>  thats just my opinion.|`|WNIL4sLiaa	1. There is nothing wrong with being a gardener.<br>  2. If he acts psychotic, then maybe he is. Even a religious zealot that happens to be a lawyer and denies being gay doesn't spit on people and go nuts on them.<br>  3. Even if he's never had a gf and hasn't one now doesn't mean he's bi/gay. Maybe just choosy. You say many people depend on him; possible this is why he has no gf. He may feel he has too many obligations to meet at home and at work. I'd want a lawyer represent me that put his all into my case and not worry about what he might be doing later with his gf or bf for that matter.<br>  4. Why not lay off asking him, "Why" he has no gf or asking him if he's gay and reminding him you'd still be his pal; he knows that already. He is 28 and doesn't want anyone prying into his private life. Ones sexual preference is on a need to know basis and who really needs to know except the person one is with sexually?<br>  Possibly he is bi/gay and in the closet, has a friend with fringe benefits and fears coming out may lose him his job, family, friends, reputation, etc.|`|xk0WeWzaaa	Your description of him and the reasons why you/or other people think he is gay are very vague.<br>  <br>  If he has been denying for a very long time that he is gay perhaps its because he's in fact not gay. But if this is something more recent then perhaps he is denying it.<br>  <br>  One thing to keep in mind is that not everyone can/wants to have relationships. You mentioned he is a lawyer. From my experience with lawyers, I know that they live a very busy life and have little time to spend with family or significant other.<br>  <br>  Your friend is still very young. He may have graduated from university no more than 3 years ago and therefore he may not feel established. Many people want to wait until they have a decent amount of money and a place where they have settled to even attempt to begin dating and to have a family.<br>  <br>  Also, If your friend was gay and many people asked him he may have committed suicide by now. Many homosexuals who keep their sexual orientation hidden for a long time end up committing suicide. Again if it hasn't been that long since you began noticing these things, then he is perhaps not gay, or if he is then he will wait until he thinks that HE is ready to come out.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!<br>  Good luck!|`|zjzfWaGXaa	unfortunately I have had a friend in a similar situation and I know this is a hard thing to deal with. You don't want to intrude but you can't help when they may be hurting themselves like this. <br>  <br>  Unfortunately the only person who can help him is himself. The only thing you can do is try to help him come to it peacefully. The next time you talk to him I would just ask him about the religious stuff, maybe he'll mention something that can help you. A "chink in the armor," so to say.<br>  <br>  On the flip side though, if he really does believe in it then you have to respect his decision as dumb or as painful as we might think it is.

a4a93d1728dc420a1fac5f2537cc444faa	Before about the time that writing was invented in ancient Greece. <br>  <br>  That is, before about 700BCE. <br>  <br>  The Trojan War is considered myth, and that was about 1100BCE. Although it's borderline, since many believe that the war really happened, though the events recounted in the myths are made up.  <br>  <br>  After about 500BC we have 'historical' events recounted by people like Herodotus, such as the Peloponesian War. <br>  <br>  So you could date it any time before 1100BCE and be safe.|`|ebc5fdfac8f50e088056beb5d5d6f767aa	The earliest of Greek religions and Gods began when the Ionics built their culture on the Greek peninsula. This was between 1400 B.C.E. and 1200 B.C.E. The Dorians invaded in 1200 B.C.E. and the variance in Pantheons created the first conversion of Gods into Myths. Next came the Achaeans and the wars with Troy. In 338 B.C.E. Alexander conquered Greece and took it into his domain. The Christians infiltrated Greece in 200 C.E.  The Greeks took up their own path of Christianity--the Greek Orthodox church--which is still alive. However, the last of the Myths were brought to the fore as myths and not true tales of the doings of Gods.|`|AA11403222	Just check your history book for the dates of 'Classical Greece', then add about 500 years backwards to it.  The stories were in place before Greece became a nation, there are references to Greek myth in the time of Plato and Aristotle, and much of the action in the myths were supposedly when humans were just newly created.|`|EWR01atlaa	i'm not sure the exact date either. I just know it was the 200 bc's to all the way through probably just before ''Christ'' was born.
yrJQHOOeaa	Life is suffering. From the moment of our birth we suffer in so many ways. In my opinion, life is but a path we walk with the urge to seek wisdom and beliefs that comfort our own personalities. Life is beautiful, life is pain, life is ugly, life is ever-changing. Nothing is permanent. No one is ever always happy or always sad. The only thing consistent about life is its inconsistencies. Would it be safe to say that life is nothing more than a way and means to evolve and transcend? In my opinion... yes.|`|8rwxS60Eaa	Phases. Ups and downs. Happy moments and sad moments. Love and hate.

CmLDcfMfaa	The first people were Adam and Eve.  They had a perfect relationship with God, and they were able to talk to God directly.  Everything was perfect and provided for them.  God gave them one rule they were not to eat of the tree of life.  But because God gave us a free will Eve was able to be tricked by Satan to eat from the forbidden fruit from the forbidden tree.  And then she shared it with Adam.  Adam and Eve were naked in the garden and after they disobeyed (sinned) they knew they were naked and try to cover themselves.  So I think the first people knew no sin, but brought sin into the world and felt bad about it when they tried to cover their sin.  <br>  <br>  That is why God sent His Son Jesus so our sins would be forgiven and we would have that perfect relationship with God again.<br>  <br>  God Bless you and keep reading your bible.

Wy0lUjP9aa	Well the reason why she is treated like an angel is because she is so young. The reason why she tells you not to hit her when she hits first is because your parents know you can hurt her really bad or possibly kill her if you wouldn't stop. Sometimes you do hit the kids because you get tired of it (I am 17 and my 5 year old nephew hits me in my lower back) I get angry and I yell about it, my sister then yells at him because I said something. My 2 year old nephew hits me too, but it isn't as hard, not only that he is so young that I shouldn't hit him back. Remember, when she gets older, she will not be the little angel, it is just because she is young is all. The 2 year old in my family is treated like that but when his older siblings (who are 8 and 5) hit or yell at them, they get screamed at by their mother (my sister) and sent to bed or things get taken off of them. My sister knows that he is not strong enough to defend himself so she helps him, or sometimes I do.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|d1CiQRNCaa	your sister. you should tell your mom that you feel it's not fair for your sis to attack you, but when she does you can't fight back. i would have done the same thing, were i in your shoes. next time, tell your mom when your sis starts hurting you. if she's a good parent, your mom will break up the fight and hopefully scold your sister.<br>  hope i helped :)|`|ORFXYTj6aa	My young friend you should find some common ground with her.Do things that wont make her mad enough to hit you.Being nice does work in cases like yours.I know its going to be hard but do you really enjoy being hit by her?If not try nice.|`|8ubAwaGCaa	You, for being foolish enough to let your anger get the better of you.

It is an actual physical reaction which we are unable to control.  I cannot recall the scientific name for it, but it can be referred to as the "startle reaction" for sake of discussion.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, most people do not realize this reaction actually exists, and when people jump/startle, others take it for a fear reaction and many times make FUN of the person.  It is part of our deep "primal" selves involved in our survival instincts.<br>  <br>  When people have this "startle reaction," others should not make fun of it.  It is a GOOD thing, it is part of our need for survival.  It is not a "fright or flight" reaction, like many in the animal kingdom display when they are startled.  But they, too, experience this "startle reaction."  Only they progress to the "flight" more quickly than we do.  Humans will attempt to locate and identify the SOURCE of the noise and THEN "flight" if necessary.

QyAyQf3Laa	Beware of organized religions esp. these two, but really, ALL of them. What is most important is your personal relationship with God and the Bible is true.<br>  <br>  At one time I was a devout defender and one of Jehovah's Witnesses but I have realized over the past 6 years, and even more so over the past 4 to 5 months, that this organization is American made, and made up by white people.<br>  <br>  Did you know that JW's would not allow Black people to be a part of their organization because they felt Black people were too inferior and were not worthy to their publications? If this religion is "the truth" like they like to proclaim it is the one and only true religion, then why would they ban Black people from being a part of their orgnanization? Would All Mighty, Loving "Jehovah" God be a racist? I don't think so for it is them that has committed the racism, and today do you see their publications? All the Bible characters are very white skin or more white than not, with blonde and brunette hair -- no dark skinned or Black people and with the bluest of eyes in many cases? This organization is a "business entity" and nothing less; and a cult.<br>  <br>  I have done some research on this organization to see just how they started and although they like to boast about Rutherford who I have learned based his "revelation" on how angels enlightened him, and how he said that "invisible spirits transmitted the interpretations, as well as organized instructions audibly in his mind. He claimed they were not spiritism. <br>  <br>  Rutherford also stated during a 1887 talk: "Enlightened proceeds from Jehovah... and is given to the faithful annointed... the remnant are instructed by the angels of the Lord. The remnant do not hear audible sounds, because such is not necessary. Jehovah has provided his own good way to convey thoughts to the minds of his annointed ones". Rutherford is a spirit medium and what does the Bible counsel on such ones --- even their (JW's) own Bible?<br>  <br>  Deuteronomy 18: 10 - 11: There should not be found in you anyone ... who consults a spirit medium or a professional foreteller of events or anyone who inquires of the dead"... Yet look at Rutherford himself, and a white, racist liar in his own right.<br>  <br>  Also, they keep very criminal actions committed by their own clergy (ministerial servants, elders, etc.) and other members of their congregations a secret from authorities so the guilty go unpunished and the abused continue getting abused. They have also had to settle many lawsuits and pay "hush money" to keep their bad behavior "secret". They impose gag orders, etc. It's all so sick.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21917798/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21917798/</a> They are false and a crock.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4jehovah.org/exjw-annemarie.p..." rel="nofollow">http://www.4jehovah.org/exjw-annemarie.p...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.watchtowerdocuments.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.watchtowerdocuments.com/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.4jehovah.org/ex-jehovahs-witn..." rel="nofollow">http://www.4jehovah.org/ex-jehovahs-witn...</a><br>  <br>  It's all a bunch of garbage for the governing body is old mentally challenged white men who repeat themselves and are grumpy like your own old grandpa would be.

This has happened to me 3 times in the past 4 years, and it happens often time to others not only in my kingdom hall but nation and worldwide.<br>  <br>  The HEAVENLY CLASS??? In my small congregation there were 4 (that's right FOUR) of the annointed class, those with the seal of the lamb on their foreheads --- those of the "heavenly class". I got to wondering how can it be that out of all of the 144,000 worldwide, that go to heaven, a whopping 4 of them, the annointed class, were directly from my small town and kingdom hall?? I am in Oregon and this has caused some concern for me over the years but I just let it go because I was always taught "If you have to wonder if you're of the heavenly class, those that have the heavenly hope, or go to heaven" then you are not of that class.... simply because you had to wonder if you were???<br>  <br>  Some witnesses are very good people thinking they are doing right and pleasing God, but God has been telling me all along to watch out and "get out". The ones that are truly good people don't know what goes on behind closed doors as it were and they didn't do their research on how the witnesses "GOT STARTED", and they also truly think they are doing the right thing... but this was their make up before they joined the organization, for these ones were always good people anyway. I hope they learn soon enough and to "get out" before it ruins them like it has done me. <br>  <br>  Now I am picking up the pieces. I feel alone -- like I have lost all my family, but then they were not really my family; it was truly a waste of time and energy to finally learn what scammers they are. Beware, just beware.

Any Catholic who endorses the murder of children through abortion or any other means separates themselves from God's family and is no longer a Catholic Christian. The Church is clear in endorsing protection of life and has never made exceptions to the right of everyone to life. This is a fundamental foundational moral teaching of the Church.<br>  <br>  The step-father being accused of rape and being probably guilty of rape is a separate issue. He has committed a sin as well as those murdering these two precious children. God is the final judge of all and he will be punished by God's justice if not by man.

This includes the health care workers and possibly even her family and friends.<br>  <br>  While bringing the baby to term and giving him or her up for adoption will make the victim into a hero in the eyes of the child, the adoptive parents, the community, and God and go a long way towards her physical, mental, and spiritual health.<br>  <br>  This particlular case may fulfill the one exception that is accepted by the Catholic Church.

GrBQuCXqaa	poison their weed|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	No.  Until they're ready to quit, there's nothing you can do for them.  What you can do , is do something for yourself.  Even if you love them, you have to cut your ties with them until they sober up.  You can't let them drag you down their emotional roller coaster and put you through a bunch of crap because they choose to stay jacked up.  I'm sorry, I know what my family went through with me, I used to be a meth addict, been clean for 10 years, so I know you can't do a damn thing for them.  But please, do those things I told you for yourself.|`|1CgK5Le6aa	You pretty much need to let them figure it out for themselves. Point out to them when their behavior is that of an addict (giving things up they enjoy to use), and invite them to do things that don't involve drugs. Especially things they can't do high. Try to expose them to the dark reality of addiction, if you are indeed capable. Emphasize that true happiness comes from connections with people. If their behavior becomes hurtful, cut them off.<br>  <br>  At the same time, recognize the benefits of drug use yourself. People expand their minds and achieve new perspective. The double-helix structure of DNA was dreamed up by a scientist on an acid trip. Many great artists, scientists, leaders and athletes consumed them. In dealing with this person, remember the hypocrisy of alcohol, because they will. <br>  Provided one isn't consumed by it, it's not necessarily good or bad. It's when it takes over your life it becomes a problem.|`|Fws9pnrmaa	Try showing that person some videos of people who are into drugs and ends up being a victim to many illnesses.  Then maybe that person will realize that taking drugs is not good at all.
mOWyzwubaa	First Understand what is Hijab according to Glorious Quran.|`|4aveC2aaaa	Allah wants to protect us from the lust in men's eyes<br>  <br>  it adds to our modesty and makes it more beautiful|`|9NniKJcEaa	I would answer:<br>  I wear it so people could see me for who I am. Not the shape of my body or my hair, So that they would concentrate on my face. And for modesty.|`|Tledw3eAaa	I do not observe hijab.<br>  <br>  But if I did, I would answer: because I want others to know I am not interested in their perception of my body. I want others to get the point I am not available for them in any romantic sense. Or even because I wish for every man to pass me by without looking, so that my husbands eyes are the only ones which devour me.<br>  <br>  I may not wear hijab, but certainly there are reasons many women wear it that have to do with the good in it, and not simply the following of a rule. After all, people are more likely to follow a rule when they understand why it is there.<br>  <br>  So to the hijab girls... you go girl. Not everyone who doesn't wear hijab is one who doesn't understand you, and I felt this way long before I read the Quran or paid attention to muslims or Islam.|`|5ofS2qQYaa	SALAM!<br>  you're back!<br>  how's it going?<br>  -----<br>  <br>  well, we cannot know all the reasons why our Creator has told us to observe hijab<br>  <br>  if someone asked me though, I could say lots of reasons, but most would surround the same idea: <br>  modesty and self-value<br>  also, it helps *me focus on more important things besides looks<br>  <br>  :)<br>  peace<br>  Allah(swt) knows best|`|kkO87h0Xaa	Modesty. Protect us for the precious creatures we are.|`|tUaRawDNaa	Allah created men and women differently. Men are attracted to women in a different sense than why woman are attracted to men. Since Allah created us He knows that men are attracted to a woman's body/looks and women can hold back these lustful desires because we are more attracted to personality and what not. That is why women cover. <br>  <br>  Also, Allah tells us to cover up to be protected and unharmed and to be seen as free, believing women.|`|bs9Zbouaaa	because it keeps safe and protects the beauty of female.

An argument made out of awe is not valid|`|f522078ffdf8786fcab6f8023c6befbdaa	So far, only one Creationism "scientist", Michael Behe, has provided a valid and testible definition for design.  It was Michael Behe who coined the concept of "irreducible complexity."<br>  <br>  If any system were found in biology which could not be reduced to a simpler and still functional and useful system, it would by default constitute design.<br>  <br>  I'll give the man some credit -- he did put it into something science could address.<br>  <br>  However, every system he's ever claimed is irreducibly complex has been subsequently shown to have not one but MULTIPLE viable evolutionary pathways, proving his hypothesis false so far.|`|bJqS9GYOaa	My opinion is "Why not?".   I believe in God based evolution.   God created everything,  then gave it a spin and let it do its own thing with minimal guidance.    This leaves several really big possibilities in our understanding of the universe.    Lets say God made the Big Bang from nothing.....now we have the universe.   God does not touch it and lets it grow out,  so it grows more complex and more confusing.   Then he sees a rock and creates the Earth, Adam, and Eve.   But here is the catch....were they more monkey like?  or did they live with dinosaurs and eventually drive them to extinction?       It also leaves the fact that life started in simpler forms (such as bacteria) and evolved into more complex forms (such as humanity).|`|czf6uhIraa	Ha!  The Universe doesn't look designed!  Our Universe is a bloody mess.<br>  If our Universe was actually "designed", it would have been "designed" to kill us.  We aren't even safe on Earth, being constantly bombarded by solar radiation, comets and meteorites!|`|fE628A9xaa	"looks designed" is an observation as well as an opinion.  <br>  The human mind naturally looks for patterns and similarities in order to distinguish things.  It also recognizes beauty, often combining it all.  This is a normal function of the human brain.  Without it, we could not have adapted to our environment.<br>  The reason things appear to be "designed" is because without some sort of order, they could not exist.  For example:  Suppose the planets in our solar system had orbits that intertwined.  Eventually they would have collided with one another and ceased to exist, or at least existed in some other form of matter and energy elsewhere in the universe.  If everything were designed by some perfect all-knowing creator, then nothing would cease to exist.  In otherwords, nothing would have and end.  (Why would some "god"  make something be and then make it not be?)  If you look beyond your first impression, you will notice how "undesigned" things really are.  Creationists claim that the human eye is so perfectly designed and complex that there is no other explanation except that some "god" created it.  Tell me then, why do so many people where glasses?  How can we be born blind or with impaired vision?  There is no design there.  Only random imperfections which occur through the process of genetic transformation, backing up evolutionary theory and the process of natural selection.|`|bhTjO8MCaa	You can't, because creationism isn't science.|`|vUiUoamVaa	It does seem to have an orderly basis...what it does makes sense.  <br>  <br>  What do watches have to do with this?|`|AA10641825	When they say "intelligent design" do they mean intelligent more or less?<br>  <br>  Do they mean intentional design, which may or may not be too intelligent depending?<br>  <br>  And why do the embryos of whales and dolphins, on one stage in their development, have rudimentary hind limbs?<br>  <br>  Is that an example of design intended to fool scientists into thinking evolution was going on, then they become atheists and go to hell?<br>  .<br>  .

It does seem that gays are more likely to be atheist though|`|VLv3Vzjnaa	You think that because you're been taught that and it enables you to justify your homophobia.<br>  <br>  As a Christian gay man, I can assure you that there are thousands and thousands of Christians--gay and straight--and thousands of pro-equality churches which find homophobia morally repugnant.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, the sin of homophobia is found in all kinds of people, including those who do not believe in God.  It's an affliction that's irrespective of class, religion, sex or ethnicity.  And it can be changed if the victim really wants to change.<br>  <br>  Those who use the Bible to promote homophobia push many gay people and others away from God.  They place a stumbling block between many people and God.  Their concern should be about the harm they cause others and not unique and clever ways to justify living actively in the anti-gay lifestyle.|`|5UJSX3vJaa	i dont think there is such thing as being gay i'm atheist i think being gay is a by product of religion <br>  <br>  kindof like the retard bands of the 80s that always sang about the "DEVIL" wow "shock shock" <br>  <br>  <br>  its all bull chit Gays, Christians and Heavy Metal Rock bands that sing about the "DEVIL"<br>  <br>  OOO OO and twilight teenage vampires thats B.S. too <br>  <br>  I think that gays are bs because of the human design penis and vagina and the reproductive cycle<br>  <br>  but what people do in the privicy of there own home falls into the catagory of being there business <br>  <br>  just don't want to hear your gay i don't tell people i'm hetro so you don't have to tell me your homo|`|AA11135281	Like many of my Christian neighbors, I find the thought of same-gender sexuality kinda ookie, but unlike them, I don't consider that a justification for denying my gay neighbors their basic rights as human beings.|`|GlCrG0wPaa	Being atheist is being a believer of the idealism that there is no God.<br>  <br>  In Christian faith, gay relationship is morally wrong because it is against the law of nature, and in greater sense, against the law of God- That is the faith of a person with the faith there is really a God. <br>  <br>  Basically, every atheists or any supporter of atheism opposes the Sacred Scriptures because in their opinion, it is just a book of myth.<br>  <br>  You are absolutely right when you also mentioned that there is a huge correlation between being gay and atheist. Being gay who supports gay relationships and even gay marriage will go to the point that they will believe that there is no God because what they want is against their faith. So, for them to prevent guilt, they will believe that there is really no God. But you must also remember that there are lots of gays who, despite their condition of being gay, they try to keep their moral values and their faith.|`|hXQjnPuGaa	Yes, there are atheists who hate gay people.<br>  <br>  No, being an atheist does not make me gay.|`|QVO9b0a8aa	Yes, being gay usually leads to being Atheist because people of religion ridicule gays all the time.<br>  <br>  However, being an Atheist does not make you gay, and being gay doesn't make you an Atheist per-se. I know Atheists opposed to gay marriage though, if you are wondering.|`|d2lvgxJhaa	There probably is a correlation.  If you're gay, you'll certainly be repulsed by the hate and bile that spews from certain religious mouths, but let's not forget the Catholic priests and other people in the closet, they balance things out, so maybe the correlation isn't as strong as you think|`|T8X7mrtHaa	I imagine a lot of gay people must come to the realization that religion is B.S. the first time it tells them thier orientation is a sinful choice.<br>  <br>  Once you hear 'God's People' say something you personally know CAN'T be true, that pretty much spoils the idea of God...|`|AA10398522	I think you are wrong.

Some people make strong statement to show how much they don't hate, but deep down they really do. Listen to these coded messages often heard from those insisting that they don’t really hate gays and lesbians.<br>  <br>  LOVE THE SINNER, HATE THE SIN: That's just coded language for I still hate you. If you truly love the sinner, you will accept him/her regardless of that individual's characteristics or behavior. Read that parable in Matthew 7 about the complaining about your neighbor's splinter while ignoring the timber you have in your eye.<br>  <br>  I HATE SIN: No, if you want someone to change you really hate the sinner. Homosexuality between consenting adults is a victimless activity that has no bearing on you. Love is unconditional.<br>  <br>  I DISAGREE WITH THEIR CHOSEN LIFESTYLE: First, being gay is not a lifestyle and it isn’t chosen. No, you really hate them and want them to conform to your world view.<br>  <br>  HOMOSEXUALITY IS A SIN: No it is not. Jesus never spoke to the concept of sexual orientation or homosexuality. As Christians like to remind atheists, Jesus came to replace the old testament laws with a new covenant. Since he threw out all those laws in Leviticus regarding the consumption of shrimp and wearing cotton-poly blends, he also did away with that little bit about man lying with man (which was a mistranslation to being with).<br>  <br>  JUST BECAUSE I DON’T AGREE WITH THEIR SIN DOESN’T MAKE ME A HATER: No one is calling you a hater because gay sex is just not your cup of tea. When you legislate against victimless yet loving activities that you don’t like, that makes you a hater. As long as an individual is not causing you or anyone else harm, live and let live without judgment.<br>  ----------<br>  True LOVE accepts every individual as is. Love is UNCONDITIONAL.<br>  <br>  As Auntie Mame says, "Darling, I disapprove of absolutely nothing."|`|U2Tem402aa	well I'm not gay I'm a christian but I say what Happens in the bed room no matter the gender preference should stay there, as long as it doesn't deal with children. <br>  <br>  But when it comes to publicly saying it's Ok (in other words supporting gay marriage) I'm in opposition|`|0WB5Tru5aa	Nice one, Einstein. <br>  <br>  Why not go to the national bureau of statistics to confirm your claim?

Being gay gives you the atheism.<br>  <br>  Or being an atheist gives you the gay.<br>  <br>  Either one.|`|MSWgVj4Maa	I find it repulsive but I am not opposed to it.

That doesn't change that its none of your business, or theirs.|`|l46UnucFaa	As an athiest I do not find homosexual relationships repulsive, I would just rather they keep their relationship to themselves.  In fact the same goes for heterosexual couples.  You do not need to be making out in front of the walmart or anything.

You may be able to write the Vatican and find out how people are chosen.|`|4068ddb702bdc41558e963e223abc40eaa	I doubt it, but the Catholic Church does have a website. Just ask them.|`|AA11403222	While the Pope is technically the Bishop of Rome, I have never heard of him doing actual confirmations.  He is a little busy running the church.<br>  There are many, many other bishops, archbishops and even cardinals around that actually do the sacraments.  In a place like Rome, there are probably a hundred bishops who do nothing more than do confirmations. (OK, I'm joking here, but I hope you get the point).  You might be able to get an audience with His Holiness, but that would be the closest you would get.|`|GlCrG0wPaa	NO.<br>  <br>  The Diocese of Rome has its Vicar. And he is the second highest ranking bishop in that Diocese after the Supreme Pontiff. he might be the one who can do that.|`|FgRUdQOBaa	interesting question but I would have to say I seriously doubt it although as you say it would be amazing.<br>  And congratulations on your continuing journey in faith.|`|I0aosHnuaa	Italy sure has a lot to pay for ; inflicting the evil catholic cult and disgusting pope on the world .... there is NO god ... our parents made us ...

Christianity of all types, including Catholicism are supposed to teach understanding, tolerance, and love...to call someone a sissy because of their sexuality is just ridiculous!  What gets me is that there is such a high number of homosexual sexual assault cases being covered up inside the Catholic church, and yet they have the gall to say something like that!  They protect pedophiles, but attack someone else?  Sickening.|`|U2Tem402aa	sure but he's the first and he gets the most amps
yKycwvf8aa	Once he gets what he wants, he doesn't have to be nice and lovey dovey anymore.|`|aWcD7Ou5aa	Simple, because he never really did care about you.  It's up to you to take things slow and make sure you know someone before you fall 'madly in love' with them.  All guys are not a holes, but, if they can get away with getting what they want by telling you a load of crap and you fall for it, they will.  Don't feel bad, this happens to a lot of good girls every day, just be more choosy next time and take your time with a guy, get to know the REAL him, before you think that he's 'the one'.|`|PjwWWMu4aa	Why do women always fall for assholes?<br>  <br>  Seriously, wtf? Nice guys are lonely guys.|`|AtY7izyHaa	how can a guy act like he loves you and then be a total asshole the next and act like he never cared about you??<br>  <br>  Cause if he was honest and said he wasn't interested<br>  <br>  you'd chase him until dooms day, to a women rejection,<br>  <br>  is an aphrodisiac . . .|`|hXQnR2Scaa	Probably the same reason girls are assholes.<br>  <br>  In other words, PEOPLE do this. I have had a couple of experiences just like yours, only with women. So please, don't generalize.<br>  <br>  Some people have no decency. At least you know the truth now (bad as it is) rather than later when it would have hurt even more.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	Unfortunately there are more and more of those today.  The good news is that some are really sweet even though they would be insulted if they would hear somebody saying they're sweet.  Just keep looking or maybe stop looking, good men seem to come to you when you least expect it.  I know, I met my husband the same week I decided I would never get married.  I was 29.|`|HE23qtamaa	Because he's just not that into you? Sorry for the cliche, but not all men are assholes. Sometimes, they do stupid things because they aren't that into you, and it's hurtful but usually it's fueled more by them being too cowardly to just tell you 'hey, I know we've been involved for a little while now, but I'm really not feeling that strongly about you so I think we should just end it." Instead, they act like they don't care so that you'll be the one to end it and they don't have to feel guilty. It's stupid, so just don't waste time and energy hating them for it.<br>  <br>  Women do stupid things too...|`|6jrv0MWTaa	It is unfortunate if you have been hurt.<br>  <br>  But i have to say, in general we are slaves to our nature, and the 2nd strongest drive the human animal possesses is the drive to reproduce (survival being the strongest)<br>  <br>  It also doesn't help that we can rationalize things even when we've been an arsehole.<br>  <br>  By all means: if you're looking for a long term mate then go for the nice guys. But if all girls agreed with you the arsehole-guy would have died out long ago.|`|VnCVkHDhaa	now thats just offensive, how can you call all men arseholes, thats just being demeanative to the male gender, you are evalauating all men under the basis of an experiance with one person, surly its the same if i was to say something like alll blondes are dumb, not that i think they are but just as an example.<br>  <br>  you sould be ashamed!|`|ou0sh511aa	well us men sometimes get different feelings about a girl and we don't want to tell you that we have lost interest in you because we know you will get mad. So we think and i don't know why we do this, but we think that no matter what you are going to get mad so might as well tell you the truth. Or you must have done something to piss him off and so this is his way at getting back|`|vbNVlcNNaa	I wouldn't go as far as too say ALL men are assholes. But yeah, there re plenty of jerks out there.<br>  <br>  Edit:Teenage boys..that explains so much. Most don't know what they really want. And when they get in their 20's, not much changes. Some mature and some don't.|`|8GW80mf1aa	Because he never cared about you to begin with, but you were stupid enough to fall for the act.|`|bHdsvFqQaa	Maybe because you're looking in the wrong places for guys. There are some good ones out there. Sorry about your luck.|`|IE3i4dhNaa	?_?|`|coPtU10Laa	Sounds like your choice in men sucks. The hotter a person usually equates to the jerk factor. Try picking the next guy for his personality not his looks.|`|TraU6JFUaa	I know, It's sad really how some men do.

8A0JdS7Xaa	Proper English usage was always "he" until the PC era came and people started mutilating the language. Some people use "they" even though it is plural, but I prefer "he".|`|R5UIMBvcaa	I sometimes use "that person."|`|JO8FKDRhaa	ah yeah i see what you mean. it is trouble that he/she business. being gender inclusive can make you long winded! try to put the phrase into plural so you can use they. if you aboslutley must use singular, you can alternate between using just he or just she.|`|Ovj9hjMPaa	They/thier perhaps?<br>  <br>  "Again, if a partner is asked whether they were missed as their partner was away, would expect the answer that the other did miss the person."   <br>  <br>  Like so.|`|SmOefD5Raa	"Again, if a partner is asked whether he or she was missed as he or she was away, would expect the answer that the other partner did miss the other person."<br>  <br>  ... huh?

But i don't know why...|`|pNesTQSvaa	it really depends where u are in the world.

Check out Islamtomorrow.com. there is a priest there that talks about how he used to hate islam and he reverted to it later in his life.

Yes, fish can be multiplied but it occurs through a process known as reproduction. Did Jesus do any of these things? No.|`|8f1i9DWyaa	Yes, I believe.

9vBqgoDfaa	This won′t write your name in maya hieroglyphs. It will simply translate your English font to Maya font.<br>  <a href="http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=mayan" rel="nofollow">http://www.dafont.com/font.php?file=maya...</a>|`|62a782905683852221ca54bad3c08636aa	Sorry to say but that font page is a load of crap.<br>  <br>  The Mayan language can not be translated in that way. The Mayan script is logosyllabic combining logograms (which represent whole words) and syllabograms (which represent syllables). As well there were also  glyphs representing place names and the names of gods but not individual letters, the language just doesn't work that way. That was part of the problem with the "key" Diego de Landa compiled matching Mayan syllables to the 27 Spanish letters. It just didn't work. They Mayan he forced to write it simply did his best to match the sounds of the Spanish letters to Mayan Syllables. <br>  <br>  You would need to figure out the syllables of you last name and find the glyphs that best match it. Even then there would be multiple options.<br>  <br>  I would suggest that you write your birthday or the day your project is due, something like that would be a lot easier unless your teacher specifically asked you to write your last name.

NH3IBuSiaa	It's not about self-esteem, it's about insecurity and self-worth. I have a friend that is in your same situation and no matter how much I tell her how great she is, she won't believe me. It's very sad because she really is a beautiful person inside and out and she has this weird deep fear that keeps her from letting anyone get really close to her. She's really just holding herself back from experiencing true love because she feels like she doesn't deserve it.<br>  <br>  My only advice would be to take a break from dating and focus on doing things to better yourself so that ultimately you feel like you have more to offer.|`|gWJqarq8aa	hunni i know exactly how you feel and it takes alot of time and effort to work through something like that, i know form personal experience that it hurts really bad to feel like everyone elses will be better for that person but you!<br>  <br>  it took me a while but i finally found my reason and i know im verry special in my own way and that i have a lot to offer! you have to find some1 who's whillin to work through it with you and showing you how speacial you are!<br>  <br>  good luck and if you ever need anyone to talk to don't hesitate on emailing me!
59vpcHuhaa	No. My school's library is infested with Twilight. There are Twilight posters, Twilight collages, etc. They featured Twilight as "a book to sink you're teeth into." They even hosted a Twilight party. I had a free and went to the library to study and there was a sign that said "Welcome to Forks, Washington. Population: Humans - 1, vampires - 500." Then they had a box where you can submit your opinion for a poll asking the question, "Edward or Jacob?" Also, an English teacher who was substituting for my AP Lit class recommended us to read Twilight.

I know some Muslim kids growing up. I had an Iranian friend whose father took him to a brothrel when he was 16 to get introduced to the facts of life. I can't imagine my father taking me to a whorehouse and letting me go at it with a hooker. <br>  The girls are checked when they get married to see if the hymen is still intact to prove they are still virgins. But many Muslim girls use candles as marital aids. A candle? Well, you have to figure that a dildo would be outlawed. But a candle? It doesn't bend and then the wax could get in there and cause an infection.<br>  So there is a lot of double standards going on. <br>  Some Muslim cultures practice what we would consider gay sex but they don't call it that. They also have sex with their animals like goats, sheep, camels. And the women, wives and daughters are considered "property" like their livestock. <br>  There are male prostitutes that go to the bath houses and are available for all kinds of favors. It is not uncommon for men to have relations with their livestock. And then there are houses of ill repute that the men go to for extra marital activities. <br>  Women are considered property. A daughter is the property of her father and a wife is the property of her husband. <br>  The men can do what they want except if he "steals" another man's "property."<br>  In some Muslim cultures, if you steal, you will have your hand cut off. It is also not uncommon for other body parts to be removed from the convicted criminal.|`|ubsq8O8Baa	it does not condemn about sex and marriage very seriously as prophet mohamed himself married a child of 6 years old and 13 other women and so on.|`|gHUHcPFwaa	Yes it is forbidden(Haraam)
