20090309090526AAt8oDe	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	I live in Zone 7 (Virginia).  I'd like to plant a "living fence" on my property border.  Any suggestions?	My planting zone temps range from about 15 to 100 degrees and snow is rare.  Fences aren't allowed in my neighborhood, so I'd like to plant a "natural fence" between our yard and our neighbors' garage/driveway.  The area is mostly sunny, mostly clay soil and is about 60' long.  I would like the material to be evergreen and lend itself to a straight border (otherwise, there is lots of confusion about who mows what patch of grass!), without being "soldierly".  The plant or plants would have to be non-invasive. A minimum 8' height at maturity would be great.  I would like to avoid Leyland Cypress, because it is everywhere!  :-)  I would appreciate your suggestions.  Thank you!
