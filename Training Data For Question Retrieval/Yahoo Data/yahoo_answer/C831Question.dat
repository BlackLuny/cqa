I've abused alcohol pretty badly in my past, so I stay away from it now. I want to tell him at some point, but I don't want to scare him off. If you found out someone's had that in their past, would it make you want to cut things off before they go anywhere? I think if the tables were turned, I wouldn't want to date an alcoholic, past or present. So that makes me not want to tell him at all! Do you think I should? How?

And I dont use breading or anything...would it make it taste better if i did?  And if so, what kind do I need to buy?

20090128190235AAdKnE8	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	I need help in fixing my Asian dressing. Too vinegary.?	My recipe consisted of honey, rice vinegar, fresh ginger, garlic, olive oil, sesame oil and red pepper flakes.  First attempt was way too oily.  Don't like the way all the oil floats to the top after chilling along with the seasonings.  To avoid some of this problem on the second go round, I decreased the oil dramatically.  First attempt was 1 cup of oil to 1 cup of vinegar.  On the second attempt, I added quite a bit more vinegar.  Now it has too much vinegar.  I do love vinegar but not that much.  Any chance on salvaging this dressing without adding more oil?  I realize that solidifying is unavoidable, but after the first attempt, you could only taste the oil.  Besides trying to fix this recipe, any suggestions on a new recipe would be greatly appreciated.  The more ginger, the better.  I do have to watch my sodium intake so soy sauce is off limits unless it's a very, very small amount.  I would also love to find a ready-made ginger dressing with a low sodium content.  Thanks.
