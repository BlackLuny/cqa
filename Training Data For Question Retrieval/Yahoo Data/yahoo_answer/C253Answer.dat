Does he sing on a stage?  We waste it all in the back of a long dark car  And I'm a sunshine machine  I want to get stuck  I want to get stuck  And be glowing in your memory    Unless you are talking about track 12, 20 Dollar Nose Bleed (Featuring Brendon Urie)  It's not me, it's you  Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me  Around my neck and around me  I'm just a racehorse on the track  Send me back to the glue factory  Always thought I'd float away  And never come back  But I've got enough miles on my car  To fly the boys home on my own  But you know me: I like being all alone  And keeping you all alone  and the charts are boring  and the kids are snoring  and my ankle's in a sling  You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing...  And I SAID, I SAID

Music, comics, and fun.   - I usually discussed about music and jamming on the studio with my music group. Some of them into manga. read a few, and sometimes borrowing it from me.  - I usually discussed about manga with comic groups though I can't really get into them because most of them prefer to read Weekly Shounen instead of waiting each month for the tankobon.  - Fun group is literally for fun.

YFi64qyeaa	Wow, someone else noticed this!  Back in the 70's and 80's I was a big fan, but honestly I haven't seen the show since the 90's. It is so weak now. I have tried to watch it, but after a few minutes of a skit I change the channel. I just guessed people are getting less educated and dumb which leads them to be easily amused. So it is now just like those Spanish shows with fat people dressed up as a bumble bee, clown, and whatever else, that some strange people find funny????  Yes society is becomming a bunch of idiots. Look at all of the stupid movies that do well at the box office. Do people really find these funny?  Strange!|`|VnRECJJxaa	it's jkust gone thru big changes, whenever that happens its not the best, with tina fey and amy poehler and all those people gone there went a lot of the great writers...snl always goes through a lill every few years, itll pick up again|`|AaXl3vcCaa	ya i used to love it so much more than mad tv and now i laugh more for mad tv|`|9091a71e93d753a15b6d91416ff86d4aaa	Unfortunately yes, the show needs better writers.|`|uGxWOIOdaa	It has always been boring.

It takes a little while to get used to, but it's every bit as good (if not better) than their first two albums.    Just a word of warning, the special edition packaging is a little awkward (it never closes properly and the disks keep falling out) but it comes with an extra CD.|`|7sqjaYx6aa	i would get it. the songs i've heard off of it are good.|`|RCbIDJndaa	Didn't particularly like it.

I think she is a really good artist. her songs are always really catchy. She can't sing very good live though :( But all in all, I think she has alot of talent.|`|1UKAho1iaa	I hate Taylor Swift music. In my opinion, she can't sing live, she sounds like a three year old girl when she sings in studio, and her songs are poorly written and don't deserve to be called country. I don't like Carrie Underwood music, either, but at least she can kinda sing.|`|vILQvJlmaa	She is my fave singer her voice is so unique|`|At7iKpONaa	no, i don't like pop country, i will admit carrie underwood can sing, but taylor's voice is like nails on a chalkboard|`|e047639a195da1944a4b39eeae16269caa	i like most of her songs, but she is still immature in singing.|`|4nZiK21Yaa	She is my favorite singer and i like carrie underwood too|`|gY4VZgnWaa	She's my favourite singer!!

Heard it on K-Rock.|`|cKuHXJQyaa	the reason you haven't heard a lot of news about him is because he is trying to stay away from the crowds and the spotlight.    he's currently in london/oxford.  he's been doing random shows at a few pubs a night, and just trying to be a regular 22 year old.    he's still in london, he was last spotted with some girl, they were going on a date, she was not an actor.    soon, he will be promoting his movies little ashes and how to be in LA.  then march 23rd, off to film new moon.

d29afa440ff68ae017715ed1abdd51a3aa	Comcast...If you get can it. Comcast has an almost 100% success level, even in the worst storms. I would suggest DirectTV as your last resort...satellite dishes can be hindered by storms, and even damaged.|`|AA10954273	I have had both and prefer satellite service.  We've tried Comcast cable and digital cable and had multiple problems with service and low quality signals.  However, the caveat of satellite service is that it all depends upon your line of sight to the satellite.  If you have trees, buildings or mountains blocking the signal, you'll be unhappy.  See if the DirecTV guys can take a look and see how your signal strength would be.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I have both services (Direct TV for NFL and Center Ice packages) and Comcast for the rest, and comcast is much better, much better.|`|bFf6Fb5daa	io digital.

"An Austrian insurance company posted an advert in major newspapers seeking employees for sales"...    would anybody talk about this if it was an ordinary ads? no.     2. they are kind of know hard workers of zodiac though. water signs being usually lazy and air ones too much talking, haha.|`|84726b724d7d1fd7da09652c50425c38aa	1. It is irritating. They also need to take into account other positions. 6th House rules work. Also, if someone has a strong Saturn influence not mattering their sun sign they would make a good worker. A Sagittarius or Gemini with a bunch of Capricorn and Taurus in their charts could be good workers too. We all can be good workers. I've been told I have been a good worker... and I'm a Sagittarius sun ( however, I have a bunch of other placements that makes me a good worker ).   Besides, I myself have Leo, Aquarius, and Aries in IMPORTANT places of my chart, so I am definitely irritated by this.     2. I can not exactly answer. Each zodiac sign can be good workers. It depends on the rest of their natal chart.

It would of been good once in a while but once a week was too much.  That kind of stuff works better on AMC.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	yes i believe so. Too bad cause that was a good show!|`|4imsjgE2aa	per TV Guide.com -     Wondering when and if we're going to see the final episodes of ABC's now-canceled Pushing Daisies, Eli Stone and Dirty Sexy Money?    Stephen McPherson, the president of the network's entertainment division, expressed genuine-sounding remorse about killing the three shows on Friday. "I really love those shows," he said. "I commend the producers. They delivered what they promised, but we just weren't able to get the numbers that we needed." His mea culpa went on to say, "I wish we had been able to give the producers series-ending notice. Because of the timing, unfortunately, we weren't able to."    When pressed by TVGuide.com to give more specific details about when the series' final episodes might air, McPherson was cagey, citing the complications of local affiliates, the flood of new midseason programming on ABC and the general lack of available "real estate" in their schedule. "It's not as simple as saying, 'Let's find a spot for that,'" he said. Uh-oh. He went on to say that they're weighing their options, but it didn't sound good.    What do you think? Does ABC owe us closure? Or have you already picked up the shattered pieces of your lives and moved on?

AA11107214	A lawyer married a woman who had previously divorced ten husbands.    On their wedding night, she told her new husband, "Please be gentle, I'm still a virgin."    "What?" said the puzzled groom.    "How can that be if you've been married ten times?"    "Well, Husband  1 was a sales representative: he kept telling me how great it was going to be.    Husband  2 was in software services: he was never really sure how it was supposed to function, but he said he'd look into it and get back to me.    Husband  3 was from field services: he said everything checked out diagnostically but he just couldn't get the system up.    Husband  4 was in telemarketing: even though he knew he had the order, he didn't know when he would be able to deliver.    Husband  5 was an engineer: he understood the basic process but wanted three years to research, implement, and design a new state-of-the-art method.    Husband  6 was from finance and administration: he thought he knew how, but he wasn't sure whether it was his job or not.    Husband  7 was in marketing: although he had a nice product, he was never sure how to position it.    Husband  8 was a psychologist: all he ever did was talk about it.    Husband  9 was a gynecologist: all he did was look at it.    Husband  10 was a stamp collector: all he ever did was... God! I miss him! But now that I've married you, I'm really excited!"    "Good," said the new husband, "but, why?"    "You're a lawyer. This time I know I'm gonna get screwed!"|`|jz2tlMiiaa	This guy in a bar notices a woman, always alone, who comes in on a fairly regular basis. After the second week, he made his move.    "No thank you," she said politely." "This may sound rather odd in this day and age, but I'm keeping myself pure until I meet the man I love."    "That must be rather difficult," the man replied.    "Oh, I don't mind too much," she said. "But, it has my husband pretty upset."|`|2a9jRZGRaa	Little Sunshine    Little Sunshine comes home from first grade and tells her father that they learned about the history of Valentine's Day.     "Since Valentine's Day is for a Christian saint and we're native americans," she asks, "will God get mad at me for giving someone a valentine?"     Little Sunshine's father thinks a bit, then says "No, I don't think God would get mad. Who do you want to give a valentine to?"    "Osama Bin Laden," she says.     "Why Osama Bin Laden," her father asks in shock.     "Well," she says, "I thought that if a little American Native girl could have enough love to give Osama a valentine, he might start to think that maybe we're not all bad, and maybe start loving people a little bit. And if other kids saw what I did and sent valentines to Osama, he'd love everyone a lot. And then he'd start going all over the place to tell everyone how much he loved them and how he didn't hate anyone anymore."    Her father's heart swells and he looks at his daughter with newfound pride.     "Little Sunshine, that's the most wonderful thing I've ever heard."     "I know," Little Sunshine says, "and once that gets him out in the open, the Marines   could blow the crap out of him."|`|uBW5xrK1aa	a blonde and a redhead out for a stroll find a mirror on the ground the redhead picks it up and says "she looks familiar" the blonde grabs the mirror and says "duh, it's me"|`|4hfXBQAKaa	Well... I have two:    Dumb Blonde Joke    Ok a smart blonde and the Yeti go into an elevator. Somebody drops a calculator? Who was it?........ The Yeti, there is no such thing as a smart blonde!    Longer Joke    A young boy asks his mom if he can take a bath with her. She says "ok, as long as you dont look under the water" In the bath the little boy looks under water and asks, "mommy, what's that?" The mom replies, "That's just the garage."   The next day the boy asks his dad if he can take a bath with him. He says "ok as long as you dont look underwater." In the bath the boy again looks underwater and asks, "daddy, whats that?" He replies, "that's just the car."   The next night the boy asks his parents if he can sleep with them. The dad says, "Ok as long as you dont look under the blanket." In the bed the boy says, "Mommy, Daddy! The car is in the garage!"|`|39OVFs5Raa	Little Johnny is passing his parents' bedroom in the middle of the night, in search of a glass of water. Hearing a lot of moaning and thumping, he peeks in and catches his folks in The Act. Before dad can even react, Little Johnny exclaims "Oh, boy! Horsie ride! Daddy, can I ride on your back?" Daddy, relieved that Johnny's not asking more uncomfortable questions, and seeing the opportunity not to break his stride, agrees. Johnny hops on and daddy starts going to town. Pretty soon mommy starts moaning and gasping. Johnny cries out "Hang on tight, Daddy! This is the part where me and the milkman usually get bucked off!!!."
39OVFs5Raa	A man arrives home one evening and found his wife in bed with another man. The husband grabbed the offending man by his pecker and dragged him to the garage. After putting his private parts into a vice and removing the key so it couldn't be loosened he walked over to the bench and took a saw off the hanger.  The naked offender said, "My god you are not going to cut it off?"  The husband handed him the saw and replied, "Oh no sir, But I think you will. I am going to set fire to the garage and leave. What you do next is your decision!!!.|`|2a9jRZGRaa	You Caught My Eye    A man who lived in a block of apartments thought it was raining and put his hand out the window to check. As he did so a glass eye fell into his hand. He looked up to see where it came from in time to see a young woman looking down.     "Is this yours?" he asked.     She said, "Yes, could you bring it up?" and the man agreed.     On arrival she was profuse in her thanks and offered the man a drink. As she was very attractive he agreed. Shortly afterwards she said, "I'm about to have dinner. There's plenty, would you like to join me?"     He readily accepted her offer and both enjoyed a lovely meal. As the evening was drawing to a close the lady said, "I've had a marvelous evening. Would you like to stay the night?"     The man hesitated then said, "Do you act like this with every man you meet?"     "No," she replied, "only those who catch my eye."|`|jz2tlMiiaa	This guy's wife asks, "Honey if I died would you remarry?"     He replies, "Well, after a considerable period of grieving, we all need companionship, I guess I would."    She says, "If I died and you remarried, would she live in this house?"     He replies, "We've spent a lot of time and money getting this house just the way we want it. I'm not going to get rid of my house, I guess she would."    So she asks, "If I died and you remarried, and she lived in this house, would she sleep in our bed?"     and he says, "That bed is brand new, we just paid two thousand dollars for it, it's going to last a long time, I guess she would."     So she asks, "If I died and you remarried, and she lived in this house, and slept in our bed, would she use my golf clubs?"    and he says, "Oh no, she's left handed."|`|wFN8bVqsaa	This is kind of gross but the other day (during the Super Bowl), this guy said to me "I am gonna go take the browns to the super bowl" and he was referring going to the bathroom!

Did you see 28 day later...that seems so real like it could happen.|`|auFmP7J1aa	Most Likely Not.  If there is a virus that kills you, it never brings  you back to life. It's impossible.   Except by some voodoo  :D|`|cU2mZfdNaa	im more inclined to believe in a virus like in I Am Legend|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	well, there is a possiblity of a virus/parasite taking control of certain parts of the body, and if there were one yet to be discovered that was capable of controlling parts of the brain, then yes, people infected by it could become "zombies"...as far as i know, the science of that scenario checks out, but the likely hood of it happening is pretty slim.  i however think it'd be cool if it did, cause i wanna kill zombies for real.  dont want to turn into one tho.  hope that helps you.|`|BJIo6twUaa	I would say you never know. At the rate technology is changing today, a lot of the shows that were considered fiction, has now become more nonfiction. It may not be the same way as it happens in Resident Evil but you never know.
vuCo9wZZaa	No.  They had a truce at the end of last season, but the fact remains  that Heidi is still with Spencer and Spencer spread ugly rumors about Lauren.  There will be no deep friendship between them as long as Spencer is involved.|`|57edf00d97af522b314c33475bf1e853aa	They do briefly talk but don't become friends,not while Spencer is in Heidi's life.

Apparently so|`|1TXJDiedaa	They were best friends the first season and this last 2 they were not friends.

Its really quite unfair what you guys have said!  I mean Dragonforce is good because......um.....well.......okay you guys are completely right keep trashing them at your leisure.    Plus milli vanilli is better because you can at least tell their songs apart, i mean they suck a different way each time instead of dragonforces sucking the same way every time.|`|QY5YOZcmaa	One was a pair of people who didnt play their music, the other is a power metal band with catchy songs who playtheir instruments.

THE NEW CD I DON'T REALLY LIKE IT. I LIKE "BRAND NEW" THO. HER FIRST CD IS OK ALSO.|`|xmdh8iY3aa	"Just Like You" I loved Give Me More and Let it Go. It was bolstered with other strong tracks like Shoulda Let You Go, Last Night and I Remember. Solid 8/10 rating. Not as good as her debut though.    "A Different Me". I'm diggin a few of the tracks right now, in particular Please Don't Stop, Trust and Where This Love Could End Up. Its also got an interesting tune Make Me Over which sounds like it should be sung by Jazmine Sullivan instead of Keyshia Cole. More neo soul sounding. Nevertheless its a good release I'd give it 7.25/10.|`|Uzg09g2laa	just like you is my fav

Smells like teen spirit has been played to death|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	One-as long as it's by Metallica.|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	one...idk, i just like metallica more....but Smells like teen spirit is ok|`|1eQcq4eZaa	ONE made me what I am today...a metal fanatic    after I learned to play it, I can play Teen Spirit with 2 fingers|`|8zcD3flPaa	One by Metallica, but these songs should not be compared - those are 2 diffrerent genres.|`|14DMKQpfaa	smells like teen spirit|`|1vCoaf08aa	Battle of the good songs that guitar hero (notice the small caps) has killed.    One, Metallica is better, IMO|`|UDAeKt7Eaa	Well, seeing as One (I'm assuming you're talking about the Metallica song) has about 10 times as much replay value I'll go with it.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	One - Metallica    You should specify which "One"|`|L4f5ONEkaa	teen spirit vs one i think im going to choose none|`|O5xCjej1aa	Smells Like Teen Spirit FTW I love that song!|`|7fe2e12eefd613a85a2294cb674aea83aa	OK...let's extrapolate this one!    The song "One" by Metallica is one of the greatest heavy metal songs ever written and is definitely Metallica's most utterly metal moment. It is grandiose in it complexities both musically going from 3/4 to 4/4 time and lyrically being based on "Johnny Got His Gun" by Dalton Trumbo. It has a moodiness and angst that is compelling to draw the listener to the story teller's nightmarishly claustrophobic world. The guitars are vital and alive, the drums are driving and unrelenting. James' voice is shot through with anger and pain, the machine gun double bass drumming towards the end is simply stunning and there is NO better rhythm guitar solo than the 2 plus minute play out of that song. It is a rhythm section players dream to play. In short - THE perfect metal song with a message performed by a band at their most vital.    Smells Like Teen Spirit is the same riff ALL THE WAY THROUGH!!!    I don't think I need to say anymore!

L4f5ONEkaa	they are stuck back in the pink floyde period    i think all the weed they smoked back then also  got to their brain and they still smoke it listenening  to pink floyde at 70 years old oh yeah this is the  best band ever|`|tlj3c50Haa	Because. They think it makes them 'different' because ohmygawd they like totally don't listen to what's hip and cool! (Despite the fact it is.)    OR some people seem to think that taste in music is somehow a skill or something that you makes you superior to someone else. It's TASTE. Whether you like Nickelback and The Jonas Brothers or Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin, it doesn't make you any better of a person. That's like going around saying people who like mushrooms aren't as good as people who prefer carrots. But they like to think it makes them cultured or some other shite. :)    Edit: Yay! Thank you Zacky xD Lol|`|kyEKb3cwaa	Because those people can't tell the difference between their opinion and bashing. I can't stand most modern rock but I don't make a huge deal out of it, I explain it in a calm way if the person asks. The reason I don't like most of it is because of bands like Nickelback. When they first started out they were kinda heavy, and they didn't have many fans. They found out that they'd have a lot more fans if they played what was "popular." To me that's a perfect example of selling out. And honestly, to me, lots of modern rock sounds so similar.     - Love and Peace -|`|gDxMoBl9aa	If Yahoo would let me link You I'd show You I asked basically this same question 2 days ago.|`|dBuj1EOKaa	That is so not true, I love Daughtry! Although some people do diss certain genres of music.|`|qLqYSeqRaa	I couldn't agree more. Some people are insaneeee! Like anything made after 1980 is garbage. People need to learn to shut up.    I like Tuesday's answer ^^    Edit: Haha, np :D That's exactly what I think, that some people have got it in their minds that they are smart and cultured if they like old music. I couldn't think how to word it.|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Because modern rock is gay, apparently.|`|yjSGVfdiaa	There's plenty of good modern rock.    I just don't really like the current stagnant plateau that is modern rock radio.  And while I will criticize it - I don't criticize those who listen to it.  People are going to like different things.... it makes life more interesting that way.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Who knows why people do what they do. A lot of it is just ignorance and intolerance, I suppose.    My favorite music comes from the early '70s, but I can enjoy Coldplay or Green Day as much as, say, Yes or Pink Floyd. There's plenty of room in this world for ALL kinds of music and all kinds of eras.|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	You're preaching to the choir here.    The way I see it, you take any genre and you dig deep enough there will be some really amazing stuff, some average stuff, and a whole bunch of crap. More often than not people look at just a little, hear the crap, and start making blanket statements. It's kind of like the old True False trick where you were supposed to be very careful about very bold and general statements because chances are you'll miss something and be totally wrong. That's what I equate stuff like that to. People just shouldn't make blanket statements.     And of course they should respect the opinions of others. You're right, there is no right or wrong answer in taste. Kind of like how I love me a good hamburger, but of all the restaraunt burgers I've gotten and all of the stuff I've sampled, I'm honestly not sure if I've had too many that beat the Superstar with Cheese. I'd put it in the top 10 for sure, and I've eaten many a burger in my day. I'm sure that's not going to win me any respect with hamburger purists, but that's my opinion and for my personal enjoyment I'll take my opinion over theirs.    ************  Thanks. I lost a bet with my wife on the Super Bowl so I am a vegetarian for a month. Guess I've got burger on the brain... mmm burger...|`|y1xPK3Txaa	There is plenty of good modern rock bands, and then there is tons of **** bands.|`|ecL0ZbfCaa	I don't bash modern rock because I don't listen to it!|`|KX8oWwDzaa	I'm with Syd, I don't listen to modern rock so there's no way I could bash it or even have an opinion on it.|`|v03M4OSBaa	Well, most people who like the oldies and classics, such as myself, are just not into that stuff. It's just an opinion. I really don't like modern music at all. I'm into the 60s, and 70s stuff. I'ts not that I HATE modern rock music, I just don't like to listen to it. I don't find it to be all that good. Now I DO hate rap music, hip hop, etc. simply because it is completely disrespectful and offensive. All it talks about is money, sex, violence, and drugs. Rap is disgusting. But people who talk about how they HATE modern rock, it sucks, its pure shittt, bla bla bla...people like that need to grow up.|`|yS61H04haa	Because it seems to be the in thing to do. The people who say that are just closed minded, and need to get out more.|`|e9Q51Oxyaa	Modern rock is just a piece of f u c k|`|1eQcq4eZaa	because, and seriously, "once you go Black (Sabbath), you never go back"|`|JLBuXqStaa	Amen|`|B3uXT6qzaa	Yes, and jazz.

Chester is mostly African American, although many of the police are white.    My friend once told me a story about a time he went to a McDonald's and all the (black) kids behind the counter were talking about a big police raid the night before. "Man," one of the kids said, "the police were after them like Israelis after Palestinians."    Ha ha! Excellent. We see yet again how people with less power are usually more politically sophisticated than 99% of those with money and white skin.    I thought of my friend's story when I read this BBC article that mentions a right-wing Israeli rapper calling himself "MC Subliminal." I'm going to run right out and get his album, because history teaches us the best art comes from the most powerful members of any society. After all, who can forget the seminal rap album, Straight Outta Darien, Connecticut?    MC Subliminal is a descendant of this proud lineage, with his clever wordplay about how Israel is "still dangling like a cigarette in Arafat's mouth." Wow! That works on so many levels! For instance, there's... well, at the moment I can't think of any level on which that works. Unless he means Arafat was addicted to Israel and it finally killed him. But I'm sure the depths of Subliminal's skillz will soon become apparent to us all, unless he has to take time out from his career to pilot attack helicopters over Gaza. And even then he can write a song about it, a song which will speak deeply to all of us who pilot attack helicopters.

Well, to find out that you are 13 was a big surprise for me, because you seem to love literature, and have great imagination and style for a 13-y.o. story writer. Try to get over this stupid thing, I'm not telling you who to like, but it seems that more and more people fall for Jonas Brothers or Twilight, just because they are so popular and commercial. but they are not real music/literature. as for obsessing over nick jonas.. you should look around. girls always fall in love with stars, when the next door boy would be much better for them.

Its like Demi is a leech on Selena. Miley is more independent.Even though i dont like how she goes on about Nick Jonas and talks crap about him and writes songs that are about him,she is more independent.Selena on the other hand got her fame by being on Hannah Montana (which is mileys show), and then Demi got her fame by being on Camp Rock.Demi is such a poser...she doesnt even write her own songs, the Jonas Brothers did.  So for her to be like "buy my album"....is just ridiculous.|`|3HgLbbuwaa	neither i despize anything out of disney channel excluding life with derek, phineas and ferb|`|PYnC1t7Taa	Neither, but if my life depends on it, Miley|`|4g8iBYEJaa	I like Selena and Demi the best, too!    Like, Selena's a really good actress, but only a few of her songs have come out, so I can't really compare them to Demi's. Right now, Selena's the better actress.    Demi is the better singer. I love Get Back and Don't Forget, but my all- time Demi favorite is La La Land. Demi is okay as an actress, but she's in Selena's situation, too. Camp Rock was OK, and Sonny with a Chance premires this Sunday, Feburary 8th. So really, I won't know until later.    They are my FAVORITE disney girls!     Let's see... Miley?     Ughh, gross, I hate her.     Miley's sucha Biatch- ****!     And she can't even sing that well. Demi is ACTUALLY talented. In Demi's songs, you can totally hear her hit the high notes!!! Miley's just average... but then she lets it go to her head!    So here's the deal: love Selena and Demi, hate Miley.       But if I had 2 choose btwn the BFFs I would choose Selena, but Demi's so close!|`|iNKnyj7Qaa	I like Demi best. She can sing act and dance. Singing is an important thing in Disney. If you can't sing you get made fun of. So basically.you have to be able to sing. Miley isn't the worlds greatest singer niether is Selena.

If Ben stays with Amy or not it's not Ben's baby and that's going 2 be a BIG problem b/c Ben is ready questioning things now (be4 the baby is even born so just think about when the baby is born). People say they love each other than next thing you know they HATE each other!

z81JIycpaa	I live in England too and I love Sailor Moon, since I was little kid. I am a teenager now, and still love it.    I did buy the first 2 seasons when I was 10, but I can't find the site. I shall look for where you can buy it. *Looks*    You can buy it from:    Amazon.co.uk    http://www.amazon.co.uk/b?ie=UTF8&node=2...    And that's about it. If that fails, you can buy the manga from the same website, or watch it in Japanese on Youtube WITH English subtitles.

qJ9o3iQnaa	I agree with you to an extent Old School rap/hip hop is Grandmaster Flash, Run DMC etc.     However it depends on who I'm talking to..I think of Biggie, 2pac, Dre, and Snoop as "back in the day"  so I might refer to it as old school when I'm talking to someone my age.      If I'm talking to someone older than me then I would refer say groups such as Run DMC are old school because they are the real old school    does that make any sense?|`|nJ5kceMBaa	The '90s seem ages and ages ago for me, because I was only born in '92. That means I only started to get into hip-hop in about 2002, so the 90's are before my time in a sense. I consider anything early '90s and earlier to be old school. Wu-Tang, NWA, Naughty by Nature, ATCQ...I class them as old school. I think it all depends on your age to be honest.|`|wfZhkZO0aa	Old skool music was made before I was even a twinkle in my parents eye. (I was born in 87 so...)|`|bc92692e5171a576e30283eb2faec88eaa	I think of KRS-One, Eric B & Rakim, Big Daddy Kane, Kool G Rap, Wu-Tang, NWA, Public Enemy... somewhat old stuff with that old sound|`|KoNHUcNUaa	Afrikaa Bambatta, Run DMC, KRS One, Sugar Hill Gang, Fat Boys, LL Cool J, MC Lyte, Kool Herc etc|`|4DzaDa3Uaa	Gang Starr - No More Mr. Nice Guy    De La Soul - 3 Feet High and Rising|`|21428fc02666515c85c83d64ffb798faaa	It all depends on how you use the term "old school"...If you ask about "old school hip hop" then it may be something from the 80's...but I do use the term "old school" alot when Im refering to something in the 90's...But since Im pretty old...anything longer then 15 years ago is "old school" to me...plus I probably have less brain cell cause of the marijuana smoke...|`|WM5gpOUsaa	i think of me...cuz i lived that ish..and i agree wit u Dominic...old school is Furious Five, Treacherous Three and cats like that..but KRS, PE, Kool G rap are old too...    ULTRAMAGNETIC MC's for life!!!!|`|VgE6HSdtaa	Um, I consider the 80's old school, because the 90's was just a decade ago. You know?|`|oJfBZ8wOaa	Beatboxing  Breakdancing  Graffiti  Emceeing  DJing|`|MAkEKCUfaa	co-sign swindle.    80-92 = old school  93-98 = golden era  99-present  = modern era|`|3oUSroiZaa	Swindle is right anything before '93 is old school except for Deep cover with Dr.Dre and Snoop Dogg(I was born in '91)|`|ZMPMqYV0aa	I think early 90's    Early 90's were almost 20 years ago go...|`|bBHlGs5waa	I think '90's hip-hop. Biggie, Pac, Cube, etc. Golden Age Hip-Hop.|`|eLN1WKLlaa	I think of Grand Master Flash, Public Enemy, Jazzy Jeff and the Fresh Prince (will smith), Whodini are now considered 'Golden Age' or 'Classic' hip hop.     I think of old school as anything pre 95|`|5FEIR0nxaa	Old fashioned, out of style, uncool. Opposite of "new school," which is hip, with it, in fashion.|`|PDwR0ehFaa	i like this question! im intersted to see what ppl right   but it to me it depends how far you go back with old school?  like there the 2pac and biggie Era or ya got ppl like The Game,Murs,Dmx ,Dre and the others of that like old school hip hop always reminds me of Murs yeah not that famous but his music has the old skool like back in the day|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	I hate it when kids hear a rap song from like 1-5 years ago and are like "damn thats hella old school but stilll goood"    Old school is pre '93.|`|eoyECL75aa	to me old school rap is 90's like dre, eazy, snoop coolio, pac, big bone, etc. but thats cuz i was born in the 90's and if you look at rap now, its waaay different from back then. 90's was real rap, todays is fake sh*t like lil wayne.
XyKnvoypaa	both :]|`|kcqe0ykNaa	mangas of course!|`|v1hCymAEaa	I like both, but I prefer manga because they usually dont have fillers like some anime do.    :-P|`|kCqH7So9aa	manga|`|i210xqkgaa	i prefer anime|`|GzRBlyJHaa	anime|`|D5SO29Qsaa	I can't really say for either.  Some anime adaptions are better than the manga.  Sometimes vice versa.  In general though, I have to say anime.  The anime has sound, so you can really feel the emotions of the characters.  The music adds to the atmosphere, and it's like seeing your favorites come to life.    However, I have to say that I prefer some manga like Loveless, Fruits Basket, and possibly Naruto (it's better in some ways, worse in some) more than the anime.  Loveless became somewhat boring, Fruits Basket wasn't serious enough, and Naruto...well, II find that Kishimoto does a good job already with emotions.  The manga went downhill for a while, but it's great again.  It's so emotionally twisting...the anime has too many fillers.  Blah.|`|2c67f64a147b966a432908672ea2402aaa	I absolutely love manga but for me anime is better. You can really see how an action is suppose to be and I love the voices of the anime characters. One more thing, I love watching animes in japanese with english subs. It has a lot more appeal to me that way. Plus, I learn Japanese from that...|`|4vrUbRujaa	i like both, but i prefer manga!!!!|`|1lkxpqAIaa	anime|`|k4iehRa8aa	Manga! Always has good detail, and the right endings.  No fillers. :D|`|jiSMcjQ8aa	It depends on the series, really.  When reading manga you can go at your own pace, reread your favorite parts, use imagination a lot more and hold the book in your hands... there's also no lag times in video and less general video messiness.    Anime has color though, and it moves, and music, and there's voices... I really can't decide.      I like both of them.|`|VmXq5NCOaa	I prefer manga.|`|tmVoiH6iaa	anime..|`|MDsUNZIHaa	manga...    haha...    you can read it anywhere... while you can't watch anime anywhere...|`|qNhblKWQaa	Manga is frikin awesome i love it|`|cLOdatCiaa	mmm.. i say anime, probably because its more detailed in background and texture, but mangas good 2 :)|`|mr5qcM3Laa	manga|`|3RPFp7Lkaa	manga ^^|`|Ttf7867jaa	Anime|`|f6xtzVUDaa	I love both! Tho the manga is a bit more detailed!|`|6SItarJuaa	anime|`|XNIkS3KNaa	Anime, it's what I liked first.  It's also easier for me to remember an anime then a manga.    Although at the moment I read more manga then anime. :)|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Manga, of course. It's just so much better to be able to read than watch. You can take manga anywhere and you can save your page, take a break for a while, but with anime, you cannot. With anime, you cannot bring it places, and it isn't as good because if you missed something, you have to find your place again. For manga, you won't miss anything since it's so much easier. Also, I believe 'twas you who said it in my one poll, that since the manga is what the artist actually drew, there is a better affect than the anime since the anime wasn't drawn by the original artist/writer. XP    Manga, for the win!|`|AhO0Uoppaa	Neither! im over 13|`|Syc0F9D8aa	I prefer manga, because to me you can really see the story the way the writer intended you to. Also for those of you who say manga/anime is just for kids you are the immature ones. The reason I  say this is because if you are soo mature why even bother wasting your time by answering this question? Get a hobbie and find something more useful to do with your time since apparently anime and manga are beneath you. Let people enjoy what they want, if it doesn't effect you directly then mind your own business. If you think it is "cool" to make fun of people then you are delusional and need to seek help. You are just shallow inconsiderate people who judge others, so in reality you are the biggest losers.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	I prefer manga because it is usually the original format and it's better in black and white BUT i think that for most manga/animes with fighting in them they're better in anime form because it is easier to follow|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey Black Winged Assassin. :)    I personally prefer the manga because unlike the anime DVD's and shows it's much more convenient to just pull out your book and read it anywhere you go instead of lugging electronic equipment around with you. Plus the manga usually has more events that weren't cut short due to a episode limit in the manga, they're cheaper to buy the the anime and I really enjoy bring mine to school and showing them to my friends. Or reading them for a English project.    All in all, I say the original is better then the supposed "copy" of the original.     Later on, and have a good day!|`|AA11176856	manga|`|HypqcnJaaa	I thought it was the same thing? :S|`|3u4HU7rdaa	m-m-manga|`|cFPQVavVaa	i hate them both.|`|TkPJYlaMaa	anime|`|ZII6YCk1aa	Manga.|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	anime. manga can be a bit confusing at times, especially during action sequences|`|wdxUb3moaa	ahhh I'm late....

XD but i like seeing colors and things move so yeah.. anime, but manga.. plot is so much better in manga's     pfft..yeah trolls dont respect what another person loves..its none of their business whether that person loves what they love.|`|o6K4Dr5Daa	Anime..... Coz it has more advance features than manga...   1 AniME has awesome sound effects  ------------>  coloured                  they move...LOL...

CyA!|`|xXeLkkqqaa	anime|`|DWqyK0Mbaa	Neither!|`|TfbR1IFIaa	Manga for me too, its more original, anime sort of takes away some of the manga's story.

If they are only seeking answers form someone who agrees with them..why bother asking in the first place, and especially on a public forum?    Now...if they had asked "What is your favorite Dragonforce Song", I would not bother answering, as I hate them, and do not think they have any good songs.  But I would not seek out a question just to bash them, as many seem to do with Metallica and other bands.  That is innapropratte and immature.      Likewse with me posting things about bands I like.  If you don't like them, that is fine.  Why do you feel the need to waste my time and yours by going out of the way to look like a jerk?  Seems kinda silly.    Now, again, if I find a new band, and post a Question like "Hey I just found theses guys..what do you think?", then I am willing to take all sorts of opinions.    But let's face facts, the people who complain the most about bashing are usually the ones who DO the most bashing also.  The ones who cry "Elitist" most often are the ones who act most elitist.    It is the nature of people to project their OWN faults on to others, and be far less tolerant of said faults when it is someone else, and hypocritically expect people to overlook THEIR faults and flaws, or to agree with them.    Add into it the need others seem to have to have people "Approve" of their tastes.  I find a lot of people today seem to have real esteem issues, and put a lot of their psyche into their favorite bands, like it is part of their own personal IDentity, and if someone dislikes THEIR favorite band, it somehow diminishes them.    Well kids...guess what?  Unless you are actually a member of said band, then people bashing on a band has NOTHING to do iht you, and everything to do with the other persons SUBJECTIVE opinion of their music.  Music is about emotion, and what float your boat just might not float mine.  So grow up, invest your esteeem and identity into something more personal that you actually have control over.      The only way my opinion of someones band is going to flavor my opinion of them is when it comes to some of these people who DO invest their every fiber into a band ( ZOMG!!!!!  How can I live without my music!!! Music is my life?!?!?!??!!   OH NOZE!! !They broke up!!!! Now my life has no meaning!!!), etc.  You know like many who refer to themselves as Maggots, orr a lot of Emo Kids, or even COre kids (though to be fair, these types can be found in ALL types... they just seem more prominent in theses genres)    Well guess what guys?  Here's a cookie, but IMO, your favorrite band still sucks.  You go listne to them and cut on yourself, and I will go and enjoy my stuff... and it SHOULDN'T interfere with either of us having a good day.    I think the continued moral and societal decay has left People with no real role models to invest in, and no help in building their own Identity and esteem.  Everything is packeged and spoonfed to us by the media,  and people in general seem to be inclined to just let them and Pop Radio do the thinking for them.          So, in short Darth, since I detest lenghty answers, I AGREE.|`|7fEVNng5aa	Oh, I agree. Everyone is certainly entitled to their own opinion.    I think where people get tripped up is on how to respond to someone who, for instance, thinks highly of Nickleback (and says so in a nice, respectful way). Too often we see their opinion dismissed outright, which isn't fair.     Not everyone has the same devotion to music. Some of us have the desire to search out new artists and genres, some are content with liking what is handed to them. Is the former a better approach than the latter? IMO, yes. The person who chooses the latter shouldn't be automatically scorned, though.  --------  amen, wire & string|`|OXvH2CgLaa	Totally. Any person who bashes you just because you don't like something is either very passionate about their music or is simply convinced whatever they are listening to is the greatest thing since sliced bread and thus have committed themselves to conforming everyone in the world to what THEY like!    I hardly take the term "this band sucks" very seriously because lets be honest, can any music actually "suck?" ...Thats a conclusion that everyone bases off of their own individual opinion! No band, even the likes of The Jonas Brothers, can actually suck matter of factually. I mean no matter how much you hate them, you have to admit that The Jonas Brothers are successful and they do have a strong fanbase. Yea a lot of people hate them, but its all opinion! In order for any band to suck, that would mean that its a majority rule, every person in the world.|`|87CAVhs2aa	I agree.   I'll saying how I feel because I am perfectly within my rights to do so!|`|UnsZKr4saa	Of course.  I believe that one's music preference is always open to both praise and criticism.  If someone gets so hurt over what others say about their favourite band, they really need to develop thicker skin.  Frankly, I would not want to hang out with someone that restricts me from expressing my point of view.  I will never personally bash someone for listening to their music, but I may question it.|`|YbmklSzGaa	The only time I have a problem with people's opinions that are different than mine are when they try to shove them down my throat. Then, I will defend MY opinion and if the spat tends to get a little dirty, so be it.    I will not be the one to purposely start it.    I must admit, when I first came to R&P I thought classic rock was the ONLY music worth listening to. Then I realized there were soooo many other genres. For example, my favorite band now (Oasis) isn't even classic rock!     If someone asks a question like "Do you like Nickelback?" and I answer no and get thumbs down I'm going to get mad. My temper can only stretch so far. I feel Iike I want to slap them across the face, not because of their opinion, but because of their intolerance for my opinion when they are the ones asking for it!    I asked a question once about a song that I KNEW was not everyone's cup of tea. I won't be mad if you RESPECTFULLY say you didn't enjoy it. But if you say "u suk listen 2 good muzik." I'm gonna be pissed. I can honestly say I have a short temper and you are going to see it.    If I am recommended a song and I don't like it I'm not going to say the band sucks. I may try a few more songs and if they're not for me, I will say so nicely. I'm not going to tell the person they suck.    Darth, I don't enjoy everything you listen to, but I do like a lot of it. Just because I don't like everything you listen to doesn't mean I think less of you as a fellow music lover. Our opinions differ and that is why they are called OPINIONS not FACTS.    I can also tell when someone is saying something simply to get under my skin and I will ignore it. If you genuinely think your opinion is so much better than mine, then I have a few choice words for you.     So in shorter terms, I will respect your opinion if you respect mine. If you insult me, I will insult you. And trust me, you do not want to see that side of me.|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	I think there is such a thing as cheese in music.  This is just my opinion though, and sometimes it does make me sound like a music snob.  But, I do like some cheesy 80's New Wave stuff myself.|`|dYyiG90caa	Of course -- It's okay to Dislike what You Dislike.    ...and If someone Dislikes You or it... Their self-righteouos and arrogant.  .|`|6D4a6PoVaa	Yes, and I have the right to say I think your opinion on Eddie Vedder sucks (respectfully, of course).    edit: Darth, you're right.  I have friends like that who hate his voice, and I understand why, I just like it for some reason.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Absolutely.    The problem is, some people are way too sensitive.  They preach about people being allowed to have their own taste, but the minute you say something about their favorite band, all that goes out the window.  All of the sudden you are a closed minded jerk who doesn't give any music a chance.    I hope that one day people will realize that we will never agree on music.  That is the beauty of this whole thing, is that we can all have such extreme differences in music, but a place like this can still pull us all together regardless of the gaps we have.  Like you said, I know not everyone will love Queen, Journey, Led Zep, etc, but they have to understand that I will never like Bayside, Nickelback, A7X, and others.  If we can all just learn to accept eachother's taste, maybe one day all this pointless drama and "how come" questions will go away.|`|DnWsMhwLaa	I dont know about you, but i am not paid as a music critic. and so the bands i dont like i dont have to listen to. and so the bands that i think i dont like i really dont know all that much about. every once in a while i bash a band on here and that is all in good fun, but i think it is just more productive to dwell on what you do like than what you dont, because you probably dont know all that much about the bands you dont like anyway.|`|OTFzJbaMaa	well of course i agree. people always are going to have their own opinions whetehr anyone likes it or not thats just the way poeple are and the way things are always going to be.     my opinion is no better then yours or anyones, and no ones is any better then mine. an opinion is just that, an opinion.   the only time things may be a bit more valuble is when they add facts, but thats not an opinion thats a fact haha so yes i agree exactly with what you are saying.   i do like nickleback, but i also love grunge and metal so does that make me less valuble then people who ONLY like grunge and metal? i personally dont think so but thats my opinion.|`|QY5YOZcmaa	Well, I'm pretty vocal about my music, but because Ive studies and played it, I feel I do have a right to criticise - as in I realise somebody like slash is hugley overrated in a world where eric johnson exists, but not too many others will realise that due to not knowing music in such detail. You can voice an opinion, but don't expect people to completley ignore it|`|8jd2AHJdaa	Agree    Well it makes no difference to me if people praise or bash the crap out of the bands/artists I am into. As long as I like my taste music thats all that matters|`|ZzqWzFNiaa	I've got to get back to work, but I'd like to take a crack at this later.  Great question Darth! I'm also very interested to see the responses. I've only read a couple, but it's already proving to be a very interesting topic.    ***************  Ok, so I'm a little late to the party here, and I think this time I'll keep it brief, but the way I see it, it all comes down to a level of decorum and respect. Of course you should have and put out your opinion proudly, whether it's a positive one or a negative one. This site is about opinions largely in a topic this subjective, but the thing that gets to me is all the piling on and all of the just unnecessary out and out meanness.     I'll have fun with bizarrely worded questions and I'll make a little joke here and there, and that's one thing, but when I see people just beating up on the Disney kids (for example you could also insert hip hop or pop act), calling them stupid, saying that their opinion is worthless, I think of my neice and what it would feel like for her to be treated that way. Just because some jerk who knows everything about everything, of course, wanted to display their "superiority" over an easy target.     I've never said that people shouldn't exchange honest opinions, and I've certainly never thought that people shouldn't make jokes and have fun, but I think that it comes down to knowing where the line is, and maintaining at least some level of decorum. Keep it a little higher brow.    Basically, if I were to write the rule it would just say, "come on, don't be a dick." I certainly think people are entitled to their negative opinions. Really, I think the difference is in attacking people (beyond a little razzing, especially between friends) with the contrary opinion. Think of it like, would you walk up to a stranger on the street and call them an idiot or tell them that they f'n suck because they happened to be wearing a JB or Hannah Montana t-shirt or one featuring the new en vogue rapper?|`|XhJuHMwQaa	I don't mind the bashing, but people need to know what they are talking about.  Some people make the goofiest comparisons.|`|YwqfYVPbaa	It's cool to say you don't like something. It's not cool to say something like, "OMFG! I CANT BELIEVE YOU LIKE THEM!!! R U A RETARD??" Seriously. I see that kind of thing way too much.|`|b32501726d33018adfee15dc84a32f79aa	Yes, they are.    I grew up listening to groups like Duran Duran and Culture Club.  The music I listened to was called talentless, stupid and oversimplified on many, *many* occasions.  But that didn't stop me from listening and loving it...despite what anyone said about it.  They were entitled to their opinion, and I didn't need the validation.    People really need to remove themselves personally when it comes to criticisms of their favorite bands...*especially* in a place like this.  Music is subjective, and an attack on your favorite band is not an attack on you.  It's simply a matter of preference and opinion.    Edit:  KP - I don't think you retreaded on anything.  Your answer has me trying to applaud as I type.  *Very* well put...I could not agree more with what you're saying.  It goes a lot deeper than the pouting we see on the surface.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Yes everyone has a right to opinion but it is natural for people do state their opinions. When you like something and someone else criticizes it people just naturally defend it. When i say something like "eww creed sucks" or "hey dont diss pearl jam" my intention is not to change any ones mind but to state my view and hopefully get into an interesting conversation. When I read this my first reaction was "hey dont put Eddie Vedder with crappy musicians like Nickelback" and me saying that most likely isn't going to change what you think but i just want to state a differing view.|`|k4GqiB6taa	I agree with you,the only thing I don't like is when people become smug or a know it all about music,but thats a whole different subject,you know.|`|qLqYSeqRaa	I don't think it's right to say something absolutely sucks. You can say things politely.    Edit: Pattern Juggler, I totally agree with that 2nd longer paragraph of your answer! I've thought that for a while, I never knew how to word it, though.|`|rR6lwxjjaa	yes i agree with you, but i think that one should stick with "i dont like that band" unless they can justify saying that that band sucks.  because theirs a difference between saying a band has no talent/skill and saying that one doesnt like them.   i mean i dont like a lot of bands but that doesnt mean i dont respect their work or that i dont admire them for being influential musicians.  and their are some bands that i will say suck for various reasons like lack of originality, lack of music skill, bad or cliche lyrics. but i wont just say that a band sucks because they're not to my taste      thats just my opinion on the subject|`|wqg3GrI2aa	It's okay not to like a band, it's okay too simply say "Not too keen on that band" etc.    But it gets on my nerves when people personally insult that person for liking that particular band and go overboard with the bashing the band like saying they wish for the band members to die or something.  Joking or not, it's still wrong and twisted.|`|yjSGVfdiaa	I totally agree - my problem is when the criticism turns from criticism of the music to criticism of the listener.    Each person is entitled to their own opinion, and just because you like one thing and another likes something else, doesn't make you better or lesser than them.  However, there are those people that so closely identify with their music, that attacking the band becomes a personal attack - and I think this is where 70-80% of the problems begin.   Person A attacks the Jonases or Classic Rock as a genre - and then Person B puts so much of the weight of their personality into that , they take it as a personal attack, and become defensive - so they lash out, and attack that other person.  They end up internalizing the criticism so that it actually hurts them personally rather than just seeing it as a criticism as a separate entity altogether.    If that makes any sense.....    Although, I'm also not a fan of "so-and-so sux!!1!" - that's not really adding to the conversation.|`|4e061QWkaa	I agree that matters of opinion are a two-way street, but there's no excuse for being flat-out disrespectful.|`|0cc7b69ea6b5f359aa006de2a67d9086aa	"I don't reside at the table of food which taste I dislike."     For me I don't like to dwell on bad energy and I am not interested in hashing out why I dislike music.  I will tell someone I dislike (if they ask) but usually do not volunteer that thought and do not pursue it to substantiate a negative viewpoint.   I find it's a waste of time, because in the end we are both where we started, standing their with different ideas, viewpoints and tastes.    This is an easy thing for me because my tastes are usually out of the norm.  I am used to "standing alone."  I am often overjoyed when I find a select few he have the same tastes as I do.  And a few of those are here on Y/A, thank goodness.|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	Agree!|`|LyZhJB1Baa	The problem is that many people get a big ego with their music and think their taste is better since their favorite band is "expanding the boundaries of what music can be". The musical elitists are the most guilty of band bashing.|`|TTaLB4kdaa	Once you put it that way your totally right. Though if someone is totally in love with a song they might get defensive over it. You basically listen to whatever you want. If you want to recommend songs that's fine. If you don't like it don't listen to it.|`|U2t6Pndhaa	I think the rash of bashing that has occured is because I asked a question about why people in the R&P section were so nice compared to other sections of YA.  It seems that the minute I asked it, the insults began to fly.    I think anyone can like anything they like.  I think anyone can dislike anything they dislike.    I do not think it is necessary to prove how crappy a band is, though.    Nor do I think that a person has to pound away about how good a band is.    If you like it, like it.  If you don't, don't.    Add:  If you think a band sucks, say so and move on.  And, don't make it personal...saying things like "Only an idiot with not musical sense would like ****"  And, if you love a band say so and say why and don't tell those who don't like that band that they are imbeciles without a lick of taste!|`|d4Kcwk7Yaa	i think it's fair to say that there is definitely music out there that just totally sucks (i.e., rascall flatts, daughtry, etc.) but you've still gotta give them credit.  it's obviously something that people spend their entire life working towards and you have to respect the fact that they try.|`|yS61H04haa	I totally disagree. it is one side of the same coin. I really don't understand how people can get so angry when someone says they don't like their favorite band. Does it really matter that much if I like them?     When people get so upset over my opinion about music they like, it gives me delusions of grandeur. Not a good thing when one is already plotting world domination.    *****    As you can see , the TC badge went strait to my head :P      Seriously, my opinion is really only important to me. It doesn't make a band better or worse if I like them. Opinions on music really are only a commentary on our personal taste.      *****    I really should read before I post what I write. I meant I totally Agree( my first sentence )... Persephone is sleep deprived today...|`|0vm66wlcaa	Well, yes that is very true.    But no one wants to hear how much you dislike a band.  If you are sick, no one wants to hear you moan and groan in pain, but they shouldn't really have a problem with it because you're sick! I guess the same goes for disliking bands. It's your opinion, and that's all it is.    That was a horrible analogy, but maybe you understood it.    But if you say "Avenged Sevenfold sucks!" or something like that, that's a whole different story. That is longer staing an opinion, that is more like saying it as a fact, which is offensive.|`|1vCoaf08aa	I suppose you can dislike somebody's opinion, as long as it's done tastefully, I usually add "But if you like it, that's awesome and I respect that". When I'm letting somebody down.    But it's not fair to go in (unless this person is just doing this to be annoying) to bash and hate and virtually b*tch slap their tastes.|`|BZIscz2Qaa	Yea, I agree with u for the most part though.  I hate it when ppl say that a certain band has no talent whatsoever just because they don't like theri music.  Like someone once told me that NIN sucked and that he had no talent, when Trent Reznor is extremely talented.  He plays guitar, bass, and synth.  So if u hate his music, there's still no denying that he is an extremely talented musician.|`|O5xCjej1aa	Agree that's why no matter what people say, I will always like Disturbed, the old Slipknot and Drowning Pool.    **Haters feel free to hate. :)|`|YlCgMDVwaa	I agree with persephone on this one.  The accepted opinion should go both ways.  If you can say why you love your favorite band, I should be able to say why I hate them.  And yet, neither of us are right or wrong.  And another thing, I don't think I should have to be polite about it.  It's just music.  I'm not insulting your attire at your wedding or anything.  The world is obsessed with being politically correct and don't want to hurt anybody's feelings, and I think that is wrong.|`|cbZdeOSPaa	To KP: Please make sure you are the last one to answer next time....why? Well because your answers are way more than TC material and they make people like me feel tiny :( (lol)    I agree with you  1000000% Darth, but I do sometimes want to see the other side of the opinions because I want to understand why people have such opinions not that I need approval to justify my tastes, for instance I do like A7X , not many do, but that doesn't mean that I'm gonna be forcing anyone to like what I like, that's just not gonna happen.  I respect everyone's tastes and yes there are bands that I don't like but I rather keep my comments to myself unless I'm asked for my opinion.  Can't add anything else because most of the good points have been already taken.    Thanks for answering my last Q btw.
21a244b6208e710c25758c16637fed71aa	well garth didnt write the dance      Garth didn't write the song " The Dance". It was written by Tony Arata.       The Dance    I will be the first to admit that without this song there might not have been the others.   Ironically it was the very first thing I ever had recorded after we moved to Nashville.   More ironic, perhaps, is how prophetic the words to this song have become by virtue   of circumstance, not some grand design on my part at the time of their creation.   What has happened since then could have been no more anticipated than it could be   re-created. My one brush with being right was pure chance, as it were.     I met the gentleman who cut it at an open-mic songwriter's show at Douglas Corner.   Garth and Sandy had moved from Oklahoma about the same time Jaymi and I came up   from Georgia. We were both doing whatever we could to stay in Nashville, trying to get   our songs heard by anybody. The only folks listening, however, were other songwriters   as no one else was usually at our shows. And so it was at one of those nights at  The Bluebird, Garth heard this one and swore if he ever got a record deal,   he was going to do it. Well, he did, and he did. I will always be grateful that it   was a songwriter who made this one his own. The song was doubly blessed   because it was also produced by a songwriter, Allen Reynolds.     One little-known fact about this song is that it originally had another set of lyrics   which, by grace, never saw the light of day. Thankfully, these lyrics were lost in one   of our moves and haven't resurfaced! The melody is the same as it was but the words   that finally stuck were inspired by a scene from the movie Peggy Sue Got Married.   Kathleen Turner discovers she can't alter one aspect of her past without   affecting the rest. No one gets to pick their memories, thankfully.     I am humbled by letters I have received since this song was releasedletters  from mothers, fathers, wives, husbands and children who found   something worthwhile in the message of The Dance.         Tony Arata was born and raised in Savannah, Georgia. While studying for a journalism debree at Georgia Southern University, he began performing his original songs in local bands.     In 1986, he and wife Jaymi moved to Nashville where his unique, soulful style began to get the attention of people like Allen Reynolds and Garth Brooks.     Garth recorded seven of Tony's songs and "The Dance" won song of the year at The Academy of Country Music and received both a CMA and a Grammy nomination, as well as most-performed song in Radio and Records magazine.           Elsewhere On The Web    ? A Songwriter's Tribute To Garth Brooks on VFR Records  ? Planet Garth              He has also had  1 records with "Here I Am" for Patty Loveless, "I'm Holding My Own" for Lee Roy Parnell and "Dreaming With My Eyes Open" for Clay Walker. Other artists who have recorded his songs include Trisha Yearwood, Emmylou Harris, Reba McEntire, Delbert McClinton and Hal Ketchum.              and here ya go just in case you wanted them      The Dance   Written by: Tony Arata   --------------------------------------...       Looking back on the memory of   The dance we shared 'neath the stars alone   For a moment all the world was right   How could I have known that you'd ever say goodbye     And now I'm glad I didn't know   The way it all would end the way it all would go   Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain   But I'd of had to miss the dance     Holding you I held everything   For a moment wasn't I a king   But if I'd only known how the king would fall   Hey who's to say you know I might have chanced it all     And now I'm glad I didn't know   The way it all would end the way it all would go   Our lives are better left to chance I could have missed the pain   But I'd of had to miss the dance     Yes my life is better left to chance   I could have missed the pain but I'd of had to miss the dance|`|f6b4d6a49f5882359cb454792d4d5424aa	the  meaning of the story is he had love he had happiness then the girl is gone and he is hurt but even if in the begining of the relationship he knew it would end he still would go through the relationship because of all the good times they had and no matter what you have to take chances in life because with good there is bad but thats life. life is the dance|`|a8e0183134a6f410bdd44562a2ec4ce8aa	maybe what someone and his mate had meant more to him than anything else. pain is okay as long as i'm with you i guess.

zIKCZi0Saa	These answers all come from very uninformed people. Yes, some groupies do indeed sleep with band members, but they are not "desperate" and "slutty" . Things just happen.  Groupies in general are some of the biggest fans of the musicians they follow. They enjoy the music and are simply wanting to have a good time with their idols. Most of the time groupies can be found hanging out backstage with the crew or band members, and have a lot of respect for their personal space.. which is why they are invited back in the first place. They are the first to arrive and last to leave. They will travel with their favorite bands almost as if they are on tour with them, thus becoming quite close with them as a friend and familiar face. Being a groupie is about the band/music.. It is not a competition to see how many famous people will invite you back to their hotel room for a one night stand.  There will always be a select few who will fit the negative stereotype.. This is not how the majority of groupies behave.|`|SKqTyJD6aa	a groupie is a person that sleeps with the band....most of the girls that tom has a one-night-stand withare groupies|`|HNmKgYnUaa	...    fit the Bill? or do you mean fit the Tom??    Yea basically groupies want to sleep with the band or one member just for fame.or b/c that member is cute looking.    they usually dont even know about the bands music or anything.|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	That's kind of sad that people would think you could be a groupie. Not something to brag about.    A groupie is basically a slutty girl who sleeps with famous (or totally unknown) bands or actors for fame, money, or no reason at all.|`|bhRuQYIEaa	a groupie is basically the chick who sleeps with the band not a girl friend but a f*ck buddy if you will lol some are really into the music others just want do a rock star|`|ZQRgFaozaa	a very desperate girl looking for some action|`|qLhtnommaa	if your a groupie then you travel with the band and sleep with them..    .. i wouldn't mind being a TOKIO HOTEL groupie...    I mean come one... TOKIO HOTEL|`|nPaQuo7raa	a nasty lil girl that has nothing better to do and sleeps with celbs|`|5oXbq6Gjaa	ummm... a **** who has nothing better to do but sleep with celebrities.|`|Wfvqyilcaa	Groupies are usually female. They follow the band around, throw themselves at the band members, act really very very desperate in hopes of getting even a little attention from a band member. Groupies think they are cool for getting close to the band (if successful), but they are actually far from it and don't earn respect from anybody by this behavior.

But if anyone was going to hook up i would pick Tim and Abby they look cute together =]|`|ad9efc98eb0fbeeae6b6c4abfd63046caa	maybe its a case of wait and see|`|K1GYtYryaa	I think that the will hook them up for awhile and then something will go wrong and they will break up|`|74029fdf261ab07bdee856f8426364b2aa	The sexual tension between Tony and Ziva  is designed to tease the audience and to keep fans hopeful and coming back for more. Perhaps they will hook up for some reason down the road, but I think that's highly unlikely unless it happens at the end of the series' run ala JAG's Harm and Mac. If that does happen before the series ends, it could work out if the writers handle it well,but it could just as easily turn out to be a Jump The Shark moment,as when in MOONLIGHTING, Dave and Maddie closed the deal and the show just wasn't the same afterwards. Or they could just handle it like they did on NORTHERN EXPOSURE, when Joel and Maggie announced to everyone in the restaurant that they'd just had sex, the townsfolk looked at them and gave them a collective "So what?" The scene was explained as an exasperated response by the series producers  to audience demand for the lead couple to hook up! So there you have it.Anything could happen:it's TV!

a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	It would only make sense for Etta to get the invitation as it is HER song. Who wants a copy (and a bad one at that) when they can have the real thing?     I think Obama and Beyonce and everyone else involved had no regard for Etta. She should beat them down!    And she isn't jealous. Come on, Etta James is one of the most respected and adored female musicians ever. Beyonce, well, isn't.|`|XSa8fgNIaa	I think B shouldve just sang her own song lol, but anyway  Beyonce did a good job and etta shouldnt be talking bad about her, it makes her sound jealous that she wasnt asked to perform,  besides beyonces more modern so thats probably why they asked her to sing|`|KuvTfJB3aa	Personally I dont see why Beyonce is such a big thing anyway. There's nothing special about her: her voice, her look. her songs, all nothing more than processed pop for the masses.    However, I did read an article about Etta dissing Beyonce's rendition of her song and her in general. And I have to say that what she said was uncalled for. At 71 years old she should know how to express herself in a professional way. If she didn't like the rendition or Beyonce's music period she could've said so in a more mature way.|`|VIcKYiFVaa	I think it's all stupid! I mean, I have total respect for Etta James but she didn't have anything to say about Beyonce portraying her in Cadillac Records so why is she complaining now.  And how long ago was it that Beyonce sang her song "At Last" and she just has something to say about it yesterday.|`|AA11778123	I think etta james needs 2 let it go. beyonce, no offense if you like etta james, has a younger more powerful voice. she also played her in the movie Cadillac records so maybe that's why. also, why is etta james waiting till february to call beyonce out? sounds 2 me like she just wants attention|`|94e38eefdf0bbad0cd53222f48961c12aa	Beyonce should have had enough respect and common sense to call Etta James and ask her blessing at the least.  Beyonce and her father have a history of offending people. For the record Beyonce had nothing to sing for the event because her songs are all about gyrating around like a fool.  Etta James opened the doors for many of these young artists.  She performed during a time in history when this country was not kind to black artists. Beyonce did not graduate from high school so I don't expect her to understand that concept.  We will see how much class Ms Beyonce has...if she apologizes or not.|`|4N6FLSm5aa	I think that it's a little immature of Etta James to blow up like she did.... I mean yeah, Beyonce probably should have talked to her first, but by saying "that girl is going to get her a** kicked" is a little extreme, and not very classy.

2d93367579d371ed53aa77712eef5a08aa	I used to make beats for some guys in Albuquerque and they'd go into a local studio and lay down lyrics at $20.00/hour.  That's the cheapest I've ever heard of.  I recorded a radio commercial for $65.00/hour and a 30 second add cost 3 hours or $195.00.  A lot of times, you get what you pay for.  I'd plan your costs on how serious the band is and how good the songs are.  If you're just some local guys looking to sell a cd when you play around the area, I'd say plan on spending $1800-$4000 for the finished masters.  If you're trying to make a living at music and make it in the biz, I'd say $8000+.  You figure 10 songs - each song is probably gonna take 3 hours plus to record, mix, and master.  That's at least 30 hours of recording and that's minimal.|`|AA11148162	Very broad price range when talking about recording music. Most recording studios charge per hour or day so it will depend how smoothly the recording goes. Call around and get some rates I've read in Oregon about $300/day 6-8hr day.

5Wgsi9kXaa	There are only 2 episodes I can really think of. In the first season there is an episode called Believe Me, Brother. In this episode Drake's girlfriend is flirting with Josh, but Drake doesn't believe him. I feel this shows that Drake doesn't believe any girl (and especially his girlfriend) would ever flirt with someone like Josh.  An episode that I really feel shows their differences is the 4th season episode Josh is Done. Drake does something really dumb and careless that really hurt Josh. He tells Drake he's done with him. I think this shows they really do depend on eachother as brother's even despite their differences.   I don't get the Nickelodeon channel although I do get a channel that plays it once a day. If you get the Nickelodeon channel I think they play it a few times a day, so you will definately be able to find some good stuff if you sit down to watch it.   Your essay is pretty good so far.

Making me choose between my two favorite bands.    FORTUNATELY, I long ago decided on Iron Maiden, and not much has changed to make me rethink that.    Iron Maiden simple has more songs and albums that I love than Metallica, and less filler stuff.    But, conversely, 2 out of my top 3 Metal albums are Metallica ( Master of Puppets and Ride the Lightning) while my 3rd is Iron MAiden (Powerslave), and MAster of Puppets is tied with a non Rock?Metal album for my all time favorite album, period.    Now... if I had to choose between which one to see in concert...at that, I must admit I would be in a pickle, since they are both beyond amazing live.    Also, to be noted, had Cliff lived beyond that sad night in Sweden, and Metallica had continued evolving along the lines he was leading.. I may very well have reversed this answer.|`|gDxMoBl9aa	Maiden but only by a fraction|`|2amRZXUzaa	Iron Maiden just because i don't like sell outs|`|JWEZ4PMKaa	AHHHH!!! Don't do this to me!!!!

Which is true ppl shouldn't look up to entertainers they don't know to be role models. They should look at their parents as role models. I think that's what he was trying to say.|`|Jsvz996Baa	lil wayne is cool he raps the truth.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	He's the best rapper alive.  Not the best role model alive.

I personally think it's something underachievers do. Drugs and not even caring who is look up to you as a role model is just so unthinkable to me. It's not something I'd want to grow up to be or teach my children to follow. He's has cool music, but he's trash.

ojEkgJoqaa	yes you do actually you need to watch all of them to fully understand what is going on and how everything came about.i have watched all of  them and am watching the current season and sometimes i have to watch some episodes to really get what is going on or a hint into something.    it is really confusing at times and you may not understand what is going on or how something came to be    best answer watch it and you will understand some of the characters and how they came to be and how important they are.    everything is vital and you will find out when you get to certain episodes especially now in season 5 because of time travel.|`|ZVngHOBTaa	yes - it is an important episode you get to know what happened to the people on the other end of the plane and also what happened to goodwin.  there is a possibility you wont understand some of the storylines if u dont see this episode.  however ever episode of lost it a good one!!|`|LBovv7Sxaa	EVERY episode is vital.  seriously.  even if the main story in the episode isn't (charlie and jack getting stuck in a cave in)  the writers ALWAYS, ALWAYS, ALWAYS! put something in there that is really important to the overall story.|`|3b29C9iXaa	Skip episodes??? I have been watching and re-watching ALL the episodes because apparently you have to be really careful while watching or else you'll probably miss something.

Peter Jackson was slated to be the executive producer with Neill Blomkamp as director. Before Blomkamp signed on, Guillermo del Toro was in negotiations to direct. The crew has stopped and resumed preproduction of the film several times while Blomkamp has declared the project dead, Jackson says the film will still be made.|`|qv5YTx5kaa	Hopefully not if it's anywhere near as boring and repetitive as the games

YsT8odtDaa	The scarcity of music through much of the movie is an effective device as well. The opening and closing credits offered a backing score, but on the island there wasn't any music to set the mood. Zemeckis leaves it to the audience to interpret what it sounds like to be alone.|`|zBkaqIWcaa	Scarcity (also called paucity) is the problem of infinite human needs and wants, in a world of finite resources. In other words, society does not have sufficient productive resources to fulfill those wants and needs. Alternatively, scarcity implies that not all of society's goals can be pursued at the same time; trade-offs are made of one good against others. In an influential 1932 essay, Lionel Robbins defined economics as "the science which studies human behaviour as a relationship between ends and scarce means which have alternative uses."    In Cast Away:  * Rope needed for the raft, and time required to make it vs date when the current would be more favorable to start the trip using the plastic  used as sail.  * water to drink  * Company, people to talk: none besides "Wilson the volleyball".

You should deffinetly checkout Versaemerge , They are an awesome band, many people compare them to paramore but they are just saying that because the lead singer is a girl, either way Sierra is hot(im not hating on haley i love her , but sierra is hotter) anyways check them out.|`|r1X7ywaNaa	i love that song, i wish i knew who sang it too.  it's so pretty

4m1U5Z7naa	I've played guitar for 20 years and as far as brands go squire and ibanez are definitely among of the worst I have encountered. My friends has an ibanez the has enormous tuning stability problems, you can play it for about 5 mins before it goes out of tune, I've had to replace components in squire amps and I've seen the strap studs fall out of their guitars. squires reputation for making instruments that are only appropriate for firewood is justified in my opinion.  As far as the cheaper brands go, I have a cort X-2 guitar and a 5 string Action-V-A bass, I've had them both for about 3 years and have had no problems with either. 2 frinds of mine have greg bennet basses that they are both happy with and they haven't had any problems (yet).    I hope my experiences and opinions of these brands helps, but, i'm not the one who will be buying or playing it, get whatever you feel is right for you.  rock on|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Both are great starter basses.  Both are versataile and as long as they have multiple pickups you can get whatever sound you want.  Try them out for yourself and decide which is more comfortable and gets the sound you want.  It's all a matter of taste.|`|YwtXSUAdaa	Ibanez, Squires are usually garbage. Ibanez starter packs are usually pretty decent.

AA10178658	Play scrabble, yahtzee, dice, skip-o, or whatever game you like.  It's hard to get started, but after you start playing it you'll enjoy it.  Turn the stereo on and get a drink and start playing.  Inexpensive fun.  And most likely you'll just start chatting about whatever.  You can add 'rewards' or dares while playing to make it interesting.  We do this during the winter when we're getting kinda bored.  And it always ends up to be a good time.|`|AA11196130	Watch the ALCS. Exciting & cost nothing. Cuddle on the couch & have some snacks.|`|dc57a9708d9812a871486c417845e1c2aa	Have sex with her.

Very popular with younger crowd and is not afraid to risk everything hes got.   Uli- Love her sense of fashion and how she loves to use color. Her style is definitly unique and one of a kind.  Michael- Very stylish designs and knows what people like. He has a really good chance of taking it all and is a favorite to win.  Laura- Good fashion sense, and has really classy stuff, but its kind of too old for me. I'm sure alot of adults like her stuff but its not really the fresh young hip fashions that I'm used to wearing.    For me I guess its a tie for my favorites between Jeffrey and Michael.    Bye! ;^)|`|171b3a5ea8a5ddf4624e9d0f9b50e4d1aa	JEFFREY...IF HE'S NOT DISQUALIFIED; I REALLY WANT MICHAEL TO WIN, HE'S ALWAYS BEEN CONSISTENT|`|c1e807f1cba23a49d0811eec19e280fbaa	Hopefuly Jefforey of Ulli.

THIS IS CLOWN MUSIC *pulls out Carousel and The De Leeuwin Dutch Street Organ* or they say Nightwish sounds like horror music and I'm like, have you heard Dreamlike Horror lately? C'mon!    They just don't know. :/    I find it funny that you got mad that they sound like videogame music .... that was being used as an insult and you're like HEY! VIDEOGAME MUSIC IS GOOD!

bsnnEsp5aa	PEACE MAKER KUROGANE (historical, drama, samurai, comedy, action)  Peace Maker Kurogane takes place in Kyoto in the late 19th century, during the height of the conflict between the Shinsengumi, a shogunal police force, and its enemy, an anti-government faction called the Choshu. This tale follows a young boy named Ichimura Tetsunosuke who is desperate to join the Shinsengumi and avenge his parents' deaths by the hands of the Choshu. But in the midst of the bloodshed, will he be strong enough to survive?    SHURA NO TOKI (action, martial arts, historical)  In Japan, legends tell of a strong clan of warriors who fought unarmed and walked the path of the undefeated. Since the Heian period, this clan known as the Shura helped shape and form history as we know it with the help of their legendary Mutsu Enmei-Ryuu style. Watch history unfold in this epic tale as the Shura and their ancestors witness the days of the swordfighter Musashi, fight with the one-eyed Jubei Yagyu and help influence the fall of the Shogunate and Shinsengumi; and most importantly, touch the hearts and minds of everyone they meet    RUROUNI KENSHIN (action, samurai, drama)  In the revolutionary Meiji period, Japan is undergoing enormous political change. It is a time when vagabonds and terrorists will use any method to prevent the modernization of their country, even if it means trampling on the innocent in the process. In such a time, Himura Kenshin, a wandering samurai, has dedicated his life to protecting the weak and desperate peasants from those who would oppress them. However, Kenshin has a dark past which threatens to destroy the values he is fighting for. When he meets his new friends Kaoru, Sanosuke, and Yahiko, and tries to build a peaceful life with them, events conspire against him. Can Kenshin overcome the demons within and without, and finally ensure the peaceful future that Japan deserves?    SAMURAI SEVEN (action, fantasy, drama)  In an age when samurai enhanced their bodies mechanically, a great war broke out. After the war's end, these "Bandits" (having become mere robbers) have lost their samurai code and now rob villages for their rice and women. The peasants of Kanna Village are filled with despair and agree to hire some samurai to retaliate, but with only rice in their food stores and no money to offer, it seems that time is running out. Now, the villagers must set out to look for samurai willing to accept such a deal -- but are there still such men that abide by the samurai code, and protect the weak?    COWBOY BEBOP (action, drama, comedy, bounty hunters)  Follow interstellar bounty hunters Spike Spiegel and Jet Black as they scour the galaxy for criminals with prices on their heads. Hoping to escape their past, they live on the spaceship Bebop, but it's a dangerous business and old enemies don't forget easily. Allies come from unlikely sources, however, as they find comrades in the beautiful swindler Faye Valentine, the genius child hacker Ed and the genetically engineered 'data dog' Ein. Will they be able to help each other though their respective struggles, or is their fate really inevitable?    BAKUMATSU KIKANSETSU IROHANIHOHETO (action, historical, tragedy)  It is the era of Bakumatsu  the last years of the shogunate. In the general turmoil caused by warring groups with different political interests, a curious theatrical group known as the Yuyama Troupe is set out for revenge. They come across a mysterious young swordsman, Akizuki Youjirou, who seems to be burdened with a dark past. Thrown around by currents of history, powerful people from different factions and personal relations, Akizuki tries to fulfill his mission to destroy an ancient, cursed relic, the Lords Head, which has caused chaos and bloodshed for thousands of years.

"Candle in the Wind"    Goodbye Norma Jean  Though I never knew you at all  You had the grace to hold yourself  While those around you crawled  They crawled out of the woodwork  And they whispered into your brain  They set you on the treadmill  And they made you change your name  And it seems to me you lived your life  Like a candle in the wind  Never knowing who to cling to  When the rain set in  And I would have liked to have known you  But I was just a kid  Your candle burned out long before  Your legend ever did  Loneliness was tough  The toughest role you ever played  Hollywood created a superstar  And pain was the price you paid  Even when you died  Oh the press still hounded you  All the papers had to say  Was that Marilyn was found in the nude  Goodbye Norma Jean  From the young man in the 22nd row  Who sees you as something more than sexual  More than just our Marilyn Monroe|`|nU7yv87Vaa	Peter Hammill... he has a brilliant vocabulary, amazing insight (everyone can relate to *something* he has to say), and his lyrics always seem fresh and not cliched. He's not a typical rock lyricist; his words seem more like poetry, but yet they still match with the music well. I don't know... he's just incredible. I can't even think of one lyric that is good enough to show his capabilities, but one I like is (only part of the song):    The characters procrastinate  on the threshold of the door;  there's something here that fascinates,  though the meaning's still unsure  and the plot so thick.  Is it some kind of history?  Sketch the thumbnail to the quick.  Oh, even though it's full of contradiction,  though it's flawed in the design  this is no fiction,   it's a lifeline.

I just sit and watch the people there. And they remind me of wind up cars in motion.  The way they spin and turn and jockey for positions.  And I want to scream out that it all is nonsense.  All your lives one track, can't you see it's pointless?  But then, my knees give under me. My head feels weak and  suddenly it is clear to see that it is not them but me, who has lost my self-identity.  As I hide behind these books I read, while scribbling my poetry,  like art could save a wretch like me, with some ideal ideology that no one can hope to achieve.  And I am never real; it is just a sketch of me.  And everything I made is trite and cheap and a waste of paint, of tape, of time.

So I don't delve too deep into lyrical meanings.    My favorite is Leonard Cohen. Why? He just is. Sorry for the generic answer.     From "Field Commander Cohen"  Field Commander Cohen, he was our most important spy.  Wounded in the line of duty,  parachuting acid into diplomatic cocktail parties,  urging Fidel Castro to abandon fields and castles.  Leave it all and like a man,  come back to nothing special,  such as waiting rooms and ticket lines,  silver bullet suicides,  and messianic ocean tides,  and racial roller-coaster rides  and other forms of boredom advertised as poetry.  I know you need your sleep now,  I know your life's been hard.  But many men are falling,  where you promised to stand guard.     From Lover, Lover, Lover  I asked my father,  I said, father change my name.  The one Im using now its covered up  With fear and filth and cowardice and shame.  -&-  I never never turned aside, he said,  I never walked away.

The king's crossing was the main attraction  Dominoes falling in a chain reaction  A scraping subject ruled by fear  Told me whiskey works better than beer  The judge is on vinyl, decisions are final  And nobody gets a reprieve  And every wave is tidal - if you hang around   You're going to get wet  I can't prepare for death any more than I already have  All you can do now is watch the shells  The game looks easy, that's why it sells  Frustrated fireworks inside your head  Are going to stand and deliver talk instead  The method acting that pays my bills  Keeps a fat man feeding in Beverly Hills  I got a heavy metal mouth that hurls obscenity  And I get my check from the trash treasury  Because I took my own insides out  It don't matter 'cos I have no sex life  And all I want to do now is inject my ex-wife  I've seen the movie and I know what happens  It's Christmas time, and the needles on the tree  A skinny Santa is bringing something to me  His voice is overwhelming, but his speech is slurred  And I only understand every other word  Open your parachute and grab your gun  Falling down like an omen, a setting sun  Read the part and return at five  It's a hell of a role if you can keep it alive  But I don't care if I **** up  I'm going on a date with a rich white lady  Ain't life great?  Give me one good reason not to do it  (Because I love you)  So do it  This is the place where time reverses  Dead men talk to all the pretty nurses  Instruments shine on a silver tray  Don't let me get carried away    ---I changed the song/lyrics|`|Vkff8N8Taa	Conor Oberst  Robert Johnson  Bob Dylan  Janis Joplin|`|AA12257580	John Lennon is, hands down, the greatest lyricist of all-time.     John's lyrics could be surreal, straight forward, symbolic, and many other things. John could write catchy, pop rock songs ("Please Please Me," for example). John could write protest songs (the case can be made that "Give Peace A Chance" played a fairly significant role in ending the Vietnam War). With songs like "Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey," John could write rock 'n' roll.     Essentially, John's lyrics will forever define the 1960's and 1970's.    Some of John's lyrics will forever be in my head. "Always know sometimes, think it's me. But you know, I know when it's a dream. I think I know. I mean, ah, yes, but it's all wrong. That is, I think I disagree," from "Strawberry Fields Forever" is one example. Another is "Woman, I know you understand the little child inside in the man. Please remember, my life is in your hand. And woman, hold me close to your heart. However distant, it won't keep us apart. After all, it is written in the stars..." from his 1980 song "Woman."    Lyrically speaking, these are the 10 best songs of John's (IMO, of course):    10. "Happy Xmas (War Is Over)"  9. "Nobody Loves You (When You're Down And Out)"  8. "Help Me To Help Myself"  7. "No Reply"  6. "Strawberry Fields Forever"  5. "Woman"  4. "I Am The Walrus"  3. "Real Love"  2. "Nowhere Man"  1. "Across The Universe"|`|AA10871021	Dylan  Johnny Cash  Nick Cave  Mark E.

EDIT: ooh, let's not forget Wayne's World, that probably started everything....|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Image.    Remember...most people WANT to conform, and want us to conform too.  Since we do not folow the status quo, they paint us with a wide brush, for fear that others may folow our lead.    Rock and Metal have long been unafraid to Proclaim that the Politicians and Clergy, have for the most part failed.  And isntead of fixing the shortcomings, it is easier to paint those who do not follow as malcontents, and stupid, as dupes.    AMEN, PAttern Juggler.  I too have known plenty of stupid Metalheads.  And unfortunately, most groups are judged by their weakest links.|`|dBuj1EOKaa	No you are intelligent don't worry what other people say, I love Metal Rock.|`|BWmSvTZ0aa	I don't know. Honestly, we're smarter than fans of Miley Cyrus, Flo Rida, etc. We really do deserve more respect from the media, as they're the ones who are the morons. They are the "underbelly of society." The music THEY listen to is society's weakness. All it talks about is money and sex. Rock and metal lyrics are deep and rely on more than a repetitive, generic hook to get people's attention; they work hard.|`|2i6TPlauaa	That's why I listen to pretentious, smug, and self-indulgent music.    I don't like metal......but I didn't give a thumbs down.|`|zXxQWGI6aa	I don't know. It's quite dumb. Listen to Peace Sells by Megadeth. They feel the same way.|`|Yc9uPziVaa	because they assume if people know how to rock they are "satanists"|`|MwiBGBK1aa	I wonder what gangsters are perceived as then...    Music can touch people and rock and metal are the best riot/rebellious music to conform against.... thus as KP said--image.|`|7fEVNng5aa	I can't stand it when morons give metal heads a bad name  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnP_m7-Wn...    I disagree that most of us are intelligent, though. I've known waaaaay too many downright stupid metal heads|`|rR6lwxjjaa	lol i like it that way.    pretty much the same reason i like tattoos other than because they're awesome art, i like that they're not super socially acceptable.|`|iJzIIEdfaa	Because we don't really give a **** what they think and it annoys them. Plus metal is something conservative parents do not understand. It is perfectly normal for people to fear what they don't know.     Remember Twisted Sister or Marilyn Manson.   When people first see them, they think that they are complete dumbasses, but once they start talking people shut up. After we watched Bowling for Columbine in class, the first thing my teacher said was "Wow, I didn't know Manson was so smart".|`|OTFzJbaMaa	i agree. a few days ago i asked the question does anyone else find it absurd when someone says rock fans know nothing about music and rap and hip hop fans do, and i think the same type of principle applies here.  rock people are honestly usually people who are very intellegent, not just about music but about the world.   they are talented, creative people, and often kind.   i dont undetstand peoples thoughts on that. rap is the genre that promotes violence, and banging hoes.   alot of rock is genuinly mellow. and i think people who listen to metal, grunge, hard rock, classic rock all the different types are mellower people.   they dont do anything to harm people its just the way some dress all in black with peircings.. like that makes us worse people?    ukk society sucks!
WfNsiz6Taa	i agree with you completely i don't listen to rap except for when those people in old cars on big rims that cost ore than the car itself have those big speakers in the trunk i think it is unbelievable that the radio plays songs like that that music is basically always talking about drug deals and having sex with any girl that has a big but. it also isnt sending a very good message to or children i dont let my kids listen to that even though they are 15 and 14 that music is why their are so many pregnancies under the age of 18 these days|`|a8qFkmSzaa	Duh the Jonas brothers rock!!    AND Soulja boy is good. So what he makes noises and makes up words. and remind me again why are you wasting 5 points to ask this question?|`|mZUXkeyRaa	hell yeah!  i only like one of his songs "Kiss me thru the Phone"  he sounds normal in it  But other than that he sucks|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I do.|`|miL4wPxpaa	**raising hand**    meee!!!!!!|`|XSa8fgNIaa	yeahh|`|SsV2dcxwaa	I totally agree with the Jonas Brothers thing. But any disney "artist" (they don't qualify for REAL bands cause they aren't one!) is better thanSoulja Boy|`|373267de54a567ce4fdd303d84705891aa	yeah i agree...rap hit a peak back in the 80s and 90s. Now its all about their money and how many women they can sleep with, and soulja boy is at the forefront of this kind of crap rap.|`|apmgNq59aa	Most of the rappers out there are pretty bad.|`|KuvTfJB3aa	Most modern rap is complete and utter nonsensical bullshit in my opinon. The only good rap I've ever heard is from back when my mom was a teen which was in the 70s. I prefer rock either way it goes, but if I had to listen to rap I'd listen to old rap....before the genre went to hell.    EDIT- I've very much ashamed to say this, but I would actually prefer the Jonas Brothers to Soulja Boy. I despise both's music with every fiber of my being, but...Soulja Boy is just too retarded. Even more so than Lil Wayne...and that's sad.|`|A1PLJKhUaa	I DO! Where is your belt, man!?|`|bPnmavjZaa	He is not a rapper. What's coming out of his mouth is considered "ringtone" rap. He is a pop artist, if that|`|g4Opj9Jkaa	Well to most people they think that music is about the lyrics but for Soulja Boy his music is like something that catchy, ring tone-ish,party song,ect I mean everyone have there own genre  just have to look at it in a point of view|`|pSkPC3sbaa	Yeah I do Souja Boy sucks|`|iNKnyj7Qaa	Well I certainly don't like Soulja boy. And I don't like rap sooooo yeah.|`|bLOG8iKnaa	I do.|`|yvWIt3Ubaa	All of these mainstream rappers are horrible.    Except for Jay-Z (even though I don't like him).

What kind of abilities do you want your zampakutou to have?  >>> oh la la!!~  i would want something similar to Rukia's...or Hitsugaya's hyourinmaru.....  I would want a water and ice type zanpakuto!!  when i attack, large amount of water would be aiming towards the ememy that would cut them!!  *evil laugh*.......then when the water hits the person, it would turn into ice!!!   =D  *takes out zanpakuto*  pwetty eh? xDD    3)If Kon were trying to hug you, what would you do?  a)Hug him back  b)Step on him like what Rukia would have done.  c)Avoid him  >>> i guess i would a)Hug him back  he's so cute and funny.....xD    4)If you can put Kon's soul in any stuffed animal, what would it be?  >>> i guess my panda plushie.....=3  Lol....that would be.....interesting...xP    5)If your brother was a hollow, what would you have done?  >>> hehe... i don't have a brother....xD  but i'll answer anyway...  since..*points at self*...I'M a soul reaper....  i would take him to the soul society....=)  xP    ~byee!!~|`|v1hCymAEaa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?

That's a tough question, I know Orihime had to go through all that when her brother became a hollow. I think I would have to kill him though with my zanpaktou, as much as it would hurt me inside it is what had to be done.    :-P|`|MuqtL8Baaa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  Tatsuki, she is so cool!

Gin Ichimaru or Chad. They are both awesome.    2. Meh...I don't know. Never really thought about it.    3. B.    4. A giant Scooby-Doo toy. Imagine that!    5. I would have destroyed him.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  >>>Ichigo Kurosaki    2)If you were a shinigami.

Its the best solution instead of letting him suffer as a hollow|`|bRjq7xZ5aa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  >>> Rukia!    2)If you were a shinigami. What kind of abilities do you want your zampakutou to have?  >>> the ability to freeze time    3)If Kon were trying to hug you, what would you do?  a)Hug him back  b)Step on him like what Rukia would have done.  c)Avoid him *****  >>> C    4)If you can put Kon's soul in any stuffed animal, what would it be?  >>> my stuffed tiger, loli    5)If your brother was a hollow, what would you have done?  >>> given him a soul burial *if i was a shinigami*  if i was a human...i would probably panic and run around in circles|`|Kgrq92Veaa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  >>> Orihime    2)If you were a shinigami. What kind of abilities do you want your zampakutou to have?  >>>  My zampakutou would  give me psychotelekenetic powers XD     3)If Kon were trying to hug you, what would you do?  a)Hug him back  b)Step on him like what Rukia would have done.  c)Avoid him  >>>B    4)If you can put Kon's soul in any stuffed animal, what would it be?  >>> a giant owl    5)If your brother was a hollow, what would you have done?  >>> I have no brother....|`|FdqCnU03aa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  >>> Abarai Renji or Kurosaki Ichigo. Because both of them are (or become) amazingly powerful/cool, and both of them are determined to become better and to protect their friends/family.    2)If you were a shinigami. What kind of abilities do you want your zampakutou to have?  >>> Maybe a water, ice, or fire (lol total opposites though) type zanpakutou... 'cause those types are just so pretty!  What kind of abilities? umm I'd probably go with anything... all of them are cool... maybe I'd wait till I talked to my sword, and in hopefully in the sword-me conversation, the sword will say "Hello, I am...[name]. and my abilities are..." and finish introducing itself. XD    3)If Kon were trying to hug you, what would you do?  a)Hug him back  b)Step on him like what Rukia would have done.  c)Avoid him  >>> C. I'd be like, eww stop it! and make my escape... and afterwards I'd employ the "avoiding" thing full-time.    4)If you can put Kon's soul in any stuffed animal, what would it be?  >>> A stuffed fish. Then it would be really hard for him to move around and infiltrate girls' privacy. Plus, he wouldn't be able to be half as annoying... while at the same time he can't run away but he'd have to stay and be available for my (and others') amusement. XD    5)If your brother was a hollow, what would you have done?  >>> Call my shinigami friends for help/advice. And if I didn't have any shinigami friends... then I'd freak out wondering why there are random crashing/screaming noises around my house at night.  (>>> Assuming my brother was older than me, and that he died first.)|`|ZJrft8a9aa	1)   well I luv Kira and Hisagi, Renji, Ichigo, Uuyu, and Rukia  for me it always changes between them    2)  Well (I know this is really really crazy, and made up by me)  I'd want my zampakutou to have the ability to copy any other zampakutou's ability, and that includes ban kai, then I'd really be able to use their attacks againsted them ^^    3)  all of them, depending on where we are, and how I feel    4)  I'd put it into my wearwolf plushie that I got at six flags great america    5)  I'd kill him so I could hopefully see him on the other side      sweet thanks for doing a bleach survey^^|`|D5SO29Qsaa	1)What is your favorite character in the show?  >>> Ishida.  I love that guy.  He's so eccentric.  He only makes women's clothing, well, he does it better.  Plus, he has the PRIDE OF A QUINCY,    2)If you were a shinigami. What kind of abilities do you want your zampakutou to have?  >>> Kira's power.  Hit them a couple of times, and then they can't move.  Instant win.    3)If Kon were trying to hug you, what would you do?  a)Hug him back  b)Step on him like what Rukia would have done.   c)Avoid him  >>> B    4)If you can put Kon's soul in any stuffed animal, what would it be?  >>> My Momiji rabbit plushie.    5)If your brother was a hollow, what would you have done?  >>> Kill him.  What else can you do?

I don't really care who the director or star is. If it looks good I'll watch it.

Saves me a lot of hassle of going through a lot of crappy sites to find some gems.

Don't let this be you if you ever become the next Miley, if you so wish to be.    OH!!!!!!! Got ya, watch stuff before I answer...Good lesson to learn. The one time I try to be nice...Ugh.

yjSGVfdiaa	Why does it bother you so much that a band you like has become more popular?  Why does it matter if you found a band before anyone else did?  Is that really all that impressive an act?    Calm down....  it's not worth all of this....|`|tlj3c50Haa	I've never even read Twilight. But I'm sick of the Twilight vs Anti-Twilight thing on deviantART, and I haven't even paid much attention to it.    Eugh, I hate when people do that in anything. Fair enough if it gets you into a band, but when they suddenly become massivley popular overnight because of something like that it's a little irritating. Although to be fair Muse weren't exactly obscure, now, were they? :P|`|2amRZXUzaa	yer they are even making Twilight vids for song that are not in the film    and its a kids film if you like Vampire films then the first under world is the best modern one|`|6LcHJbHjaa	I never read the book, so i really don't care|`|1vCoaf08aa	Hmm, actually, ever since the movie came out, I haven't heard much about Twilight.    I mean, it's practically dead as of the moment, but, depending on how long they can keep this fad up, it'll be loud and strong come time for New Moon to be released in the theater.|`|Z7c5d0nuaa	okay?    there's no need to get your knickers in a bunch.

Loads of people are suddenly like "Woohoo GNR!" and they only know approximatley one song.     However, i don't care. Put simply. If they wanna love that one GNR song then im very happy for them & im very happy that GNR's music is reaching yet another new generation.     They can call themselves a 'true fan' if they want or they can admit that they only know like one song. In all honesty, it doesnt affect my life one way or another, so no...to answer your question, im not pissed off at anything like that.|`|7lCJsp0naa	This situation has occured 1265849302 times in music history. Best advice I could give you is to stick with Muse because to all these so called "true" fans out there, they are probably just another "fad" band and will forget about them when they make a second soundtrack and it starts all over again with another band.    Damn it...I hate trolls. And I don't give a crap about Twilight. Just keep on rolling with your life. Muse will eventually fade away to these "true" fans and you can be proud and say that you stuck with them all the way.|`|f948d748facdf196074d849ea9c465c4aa	Im not a Muse fan but i totally agree. Twilight is like the jonas brothers of books.|`|tVUBqdSzaa	the vampires sparkling thing make vampires sound cute. vampires aren't supposed to be cute, just change the whole story is rainbows and unicorns if sparkles are involved for that matter.   it seems like every 11 year old i see is obsessed with rob pattinson. it's like "he's not gonna MARRY you for crying out loud!" for some reason, they seem like over-obsessed jb fans on that level i mean seriously... like how jb fans have "OMJ" (oh my jonas), this one girl was like "OME!" and i was like "what's that?" "it's Oh my edward!"  jeez, teenie boppers, get a hobby or something.|`|6XGcqXQOaa	What kind of Vampire movie uses a Paramore song? Twilight seems like a childrens Vampire fairytail and not a real Vampire movie at all. I wish they would get over it.|`|rXq7ssXBaa	Haha bloody hell, yes!!!    See, I wanna be part of the few people in the future to say     "Nope, I didn't succomb to Twilight and its taking-over-the-world-ness!"    Like how they do on I love the 80s, but like, I love the 2000s haha 20 years from now.|`|M6DQpIxwaa	I agree. I am only familiar with Muse through the Watchmen trailer 3 track but even Twilight fans has taken over my mentally gifted class. Our project was to create a fictional ice cream brand. I was gone for two weeks, and guess what they did? Clair De Lune. A song on Twilight soundtrack. They based everything on Twilight. It sucks. I'm associated with these devout Meyers followers, and it's not funny.|`|A2wXfJkbaa	totally agree...they're way to obssessed with the stupid books and the movie...its like "wow its a movie, you dont have to base your whole life on it..."|`|us9JQrTJaa	I know what you mean. I pretty much agree now.  I actually used to love the series, (plus I read it when it first freaking came out !), and knew about Muse before it, along with Claude Debussy, but now that the movie's come out, it's so popular and everyone loves it. It makes me so angry. I basically hate the book now and it's depressing to see it on my shelf. The movie sucked, too.|`|qYmpZFgLaa	Hey I can remember back to the days when "A Walk To Remember" came out and a little-known band named Switchfoot started to get more buzz...a lot of people gave the fans of the movie crap and this hierarchy of "where did you find out about Switchfoot" or "how long have *you* known about them" started up. It's a load of crap.    The fact of the matter is, this too shall pass. The superficial fans will burn off in time and those who truly care about the music will stick around. But just remember that people can legitimately become a fan of a band because of a movie soundtrack...that's why bands agree to have their songs featured on them in the first place. Since AWTR I have been a fan of Switchfoot for seven years, have seen them live 7 times, and have met them in person on three occasions...not to mention the website I ran for them for a few years. I'm not saying all fans end up like this...but it can happen!|`|0d694f6c4ec28638d573b71ebfcf6a61aa	I agree! (I listened to Muse months before I heard of Twilight, and I'm proud to say I haven't read it or seen the movie! lol) I hate it when people know nothing about a band and claim to like them.   Kind of like my sister. She's more of a pop kind of person, but she likes like, three Disturbed songs and claims she's a fan. She also listened to Avenged Sevenfold (I don't really like them, but still) for like, two weeks, and considered herself all "hardcore" or something. It's kind of insulting to the true fans of a band because of all the...I hate to say "unworthy", but I don't know how else to describe it, fans...Anyway, I completely agree with you on everything!|`|J5FslwZXaa	I am a Twilight fan.    That's how I got to listening to Muse.    I now love Muse. BUT NOT BECAUSE OF TWILIGHT.    I am a huge Muse fan and yes, I got into it because of Stephenie Meyer but I've branched off of that and listen to more songs from the band. I bet you even if I hadn't heard of Twilight, I would have eventually found Muse and fallen in love with them    My top five favorite songs:    1. Exo-Politics  2. Map of the Problematique  3. Bliss  4. Hyper Music  5. Soldier's Poem    Matt Bellamy is an amazing singer and guitarist who I admire very much because of his work in music and also because he's an open Atheist and it takes a lot of guts to come out with that.    But Christopher is best. :)    Please, don't be so quick to judge. Yes, I'm a Twilight fan but I disagree with some of the fans. Don't group us all together. We're individual people and I don't appreciate being "annoyed with" when it's someone else pestering people. Keep that in mind.|`|BgClmJb8aa	lol, yeah I love muse too, starlight was an awesome song, muse were always really famous anyway so anyone who hadn't heard of them until twilight clearly don't know much about the indie/alternative genre anyway.     Anyway you should be happy for their success!    Although I know what you mean, I liked the song America by Razorlight before it became famous, really annoyed me when half a year late people were saying "Hey! have you heard Razorlights new song? its awesome"     Put me off the band
aCcRsh7uaa	I think your biggest priority at this point should be taking English tutoring lessons with your spare time, not acting.  Once you feel confident that you can read a script, then approach the drama club.  Being a member of the drama club certainly couldn't hurt, but I don't know how much it will help either. Good luck!

i210xqkgaa	i think its still good (the cards) but the fad has passed and we all just leave them out of our lives since it has become "lame". i remember the original show, and when i think about it, season 1 was amazing, but the rest was just lacking in tradgedy and an actual reason for the dualing. yugiio GX started out good, but it soon suffered the same fate. yugioh 5D's was always terrible.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	Yupp, actually lately ive gotten into the old cards and there amazing fun and i have an awesome deck too and theyve gone super overboard with all the shows i watched as a kid cough yugioh digimon pokemon cough the other week i watched an episode of the newest digimon series and it was so terrible that i couldnt watch i just had to turn it off|`|SxXFofFtaa	Yugioh the Abridged Series is better.|`|2d8f11f8ab135e523b17936a02b63c9daa	YES.

7009b521a1e1f37ff2ab8a3e813bfa5eaa	I read the book. It was good, not great. It blatantly ripped off Lord of the Rings and star wars. Even though, it was still exciting. On the other hand, the movie sucked balls. I will never have that 104 minutes of my life back. NEVER! I was with my friend, and half way thruogh the movie he said" There better be a kick a** battle scene at the end. There wasn't! Oh my GOD it was horrible. I complained to AMC. If they even THINK about doing Eldest, they should get a new production crew and cast.|`|4585afb8ecfdaef590b604938257fc53aa	Oh, well I'm sorry you feel this way about the movie.  I'm a total LotR fan.    But I loved Eragon! I mean no, it wasn't as extreme as LotR, but it had what I needed. Perhaps it's just beacuse I love (well done) fantasy/adventure.    But yeah, I went into Eragon, and came out with all expectations met. :)    It wasn't that orignial, but I think it was still done well.|`|17aebfb2406a2122a9336be2bc396cf1aa	I LOVED ERAGON!

AA11710920	Santogold is brilliant, isn't she? I never noticed the Dale Bozzio similarity before :) I do notice that she's a musical shape-shifter and can slip into any vocal persona she likes, which is the appeal of her music.     But to answer the question, at times I notice a sort of Gwen Stefani-likeness to her vocal style in the song "Superman".   (not a huge Stefani fan myself, but, well you get the picture)    http://www.imeem.com/santogold/music/QQ0...    But I also notice that  "Superman"  reminds me too much of a Siouxsie & The Banshees song called Red Light:     http://www.imeem.com/rockmusic15/music/B...    Not sure if you hear any hint of Siouxsie in her voice, too|`|FDt7cC8haa	First, let me applaud you...not many people on this planet even remember Missing Persons....let alone the name their singer....Also I was rather surprised to hear a similarity in their vocals...  Well Done|`|N62uLMf3aa	sure does!  how about this one? I always thought they sound similar.  Bryan Ferry vs. David Byrne, then again Roxy Music came first    "Remake/Remodel" - Roxy Music  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4KwJDDLjN...

1bb71e635a87f9c2d8220d95e3475ff6aa	If you only knew...    I have so, so many "To-Do" lists for everything imaginable.  One Y!A user had a quote on his 360 page that epitomized my life beautifully with an optimistic twist.    "I was put on this earth to accomplish a certain number of things. Right now I am so far behind that I will never die."    Immortality...not such a bad price to pay for "fooling" around.|`|0a95d8c3d12418145b2bead1e9aa0a40aa	No not really, take each day as it comes really however, i do have the larger things in life like get married, have babies, practise having babies a lot, buy lots of property, be happy, bring children up well.....etc    *-*|`|AA10886429	nope but once i tried to make one but i said to my self that everthing i'd want to put there would be stupid like watching movies at the mall all day, eating mcdonalds the whole week every single meal of the day, just some stupid fun stuff that would come to my head|`|AA10053661	I have to live day to day. It's almost more than I can handle some days getting up and tackling all that has to be done. If I look beyond too much, that is when I shut down. I get overwhelmed by all I need to accomplish...... so I don't look past today. My daily to do list is just too long itself. My life list would go on for miles. So I simply check things off daily.... and then move on to the next day.|`|44c61ebbdf1b1abb39472ef3706acb43aa	YES..and it is sooooo long....sigh|`|AA11622224	Yes, ever since I was 9 years old. I'm 18 years old~~hehehe  And yourself?|`|AA10297617	not anymore|`|15552dbbcb2505f70379948650cb7b5aaa	well, I have to write... as much as I can. Unfortunately, I'm lazy... more than I can, lol|`|AA11248371	nope, that kind of negates the spontaneity of life which is closer to its true nature and without a list I'm ready for any adventure on a moments notice without having to consider that the resources used might be committed to another activity|`|9680336e07965e8ee9b302b44edceb40aa	nope.|`|AA12304872	No. I don't think that's a good idea.|`|7b3e05db5219ea29cc35a5b00551fcbaaa	no...i just take each day as it comes because i could make a list but who's to say that something might happen and then ruin my plans|`|AA11607416	yes TO DO GIRLS bahaha|`|ce6fa68751a113a2938b9beb6b6226ecaa	yes,  a 'to do before I die' list.|`|99b27e3897c6eef022d357ffc2d3da1aaa	Nope, I have goals I want to achieve for certain ages, but I re-evaluate those every once in a while because as things change so must we. If we try to hard to adhere to one specific "To-Do List" then we might end up letting great oppurtunities pass us by, simply because they were not part of the "plan".|`|4e47b70d6c20f79fffd40b3029df36e8aa	nope, but perhaps having one would streamline my life a bit, and make my decisions a bit more focused.

ac6e01d43537294ff14ee1abbafb665baa	It's a marketing ploy.  KISS FM is owned by Clear Channel Radio, the big comglomerate everyone hates.  Obviously, you live in Austin and realize the traffic that goes through the city daily.  Many folks are just passing through the city, and that's how KISS FM reels in a listener.  It makes the listener think the format is new and improved.  (I know a former DJ from 101X who would tell me all about stuff like this.)    I would listen when it was KHFI, but not KISS FM.  My other favorites were 101X, KLBJ, KGSR and Mix 94.7.  And for awhile, there was an 80's station on 107.7 called The Edge that I liked and there was like a sister station to KISS FM that played club music.  I LOVED that station.      I left Austin due to health reasons in 2002, but I still love the city, the people in it, and the neat stuff in town that just says "Austin".    Peace, my Austin friend!

a4f44d588dc3a3f295601ae27fb43c27aa	-_- your question sounds a bit vague. I mean...did you watch the japanese, or english? which series was it that you watched?    The English DVDs are composed of the 4 out of 5 seasons of Sailor Moon.    Sailor Moon (composed of Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R)  Sailor Moon S  Sailor Moon SuperS    There is also a boxed set featuring 3 movies released by Pioneer,  in bilingual and uncut formats.    ADV Films released the original Japanese version of the first 2 seasons of Sailor Moon (Sailor Moon and Sailor Moon R). That was great because a lot of Sailor Moon fans knew that the American version was heavily edited and skipped episodes never before seen in the US.    The last season, Sailor Moon Sailor Stars, was never licensed in the US, but it's out on DVD in Japan, and people buy the Import in the USA.     So, if we can recap, there are 5 seasons of Sailor Moon.    Sailor Moon  Sailor Moon R  Sailor Moon S  Sailor Moon SuperS  Sailor Moon Sailor Stars      ...have you watched all of them? And in terms of your answer, yes. Isn't that why we have DVDs in the first place? >_>    -TCC    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sailor_Moon...  - Look at this for basic information on the Japanese, and the English dub release, then you'll know for sure if you watched all of them.|`|0a2ecdcaf1ea2f896842ac11932142e3aa	some of them..... because i have them all both. but some are collections but some arent. i guess it just depends on which dvds u buy. u might want to buy some of them because after all u r watching it of the internet so yeah.
9f68ac0bfa4bb7eb2249388e78090905aa	I think just because a person acts crazy doesn't mean they are crazy.(Nicholson's character is just looking for an easy way out of prison, the supposedly mute Indian) The antagonist is the whole psychiatric system and how the mentally ill are dealt with. The protagonist is Nicholson's character and how in the end he "really did lose part of his mind"|`|0efb973c92c6e8ecd2331f3270a42499aa	well that is up for debate...you could say that Nicholson's character was either or, that the system was either or, nurse rached...depends on your view point...|`|ae6d07a4861a25bd63c81ef2d2531baaaa	well, i think the story is about the free spirit of nicholson in the age of pharmaceutical medicine.  nicholson is the protagonist and fletcher, the head nurse, is the antagonist
5DmgmmvTaa	At first I thought it was literally about history, but now I'm thinking that it is (pardon my terminology) about like the business world or working to the top and falling (and all of the people who are trying to stop you). I suppose that it could also refer to the music industry as well.     Interpret it as you choose. After all, there is no wrong way to interpret something(even if the person who wrote it had a different perspective)!

Long live the king!"    One minute I held the key  Next the walls were closed on me  And I discovered that my castles stand  Upon pillars of salt and pillars of sand    I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  Be my mirror, my sword and shield  My missionaries in a foreign field    For some reason I can't explain  Once you go there was never  Never an honest word  And that was when I ruled the world    It was the wicked and wild wind  Blew down the doors to let me in  Shattered windows and the sound of drums  People couldn't believe what I'd become    Revolutionaries wait  For my head on a silver plate  Just a puppet on a lonely string  Oh who would ever want to be king?    I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  Be my mirror, my sword and shield  My missionaries in a foreign field    For some reason I can't explain  I know Saint Peter won't call my name  Never an honest word  But that was when I ruled the world    I hear Jerusalem bells a ringing  Roman Cavalry choirs are singing  Be my mirror, my sword and shield  My missionaries in a foreign field    For some reason I can't explain  I know Saint Peter won't call my name  Never an honest word  But that was when I ruled the w|`|qnURfWqdaa	its supposidly about a spainish painting called "viva la vida"    exceot the storyline describes the french revolution perfectly|`|5vaBqfDIaa	The lyrics say it's about a king who "used to rule the world", then the world as he knew it was turned upside down.

De Liam Gallagher slo se puede decir que es una de las figuras ms da?adas y desubicadas del rock.    Ahora bien, si hablas de canciones, tengo muchas canciones favoritas como: "Turn Up The Sun" (El intro y el outro son de un altsimo nivel), "Let Ther Be Love", "Cigarettes & Alcohol", "Go Let It Out", "Love Like A Bomb" (el solo de piano le da otro matiz a la cancin), "Stop Crying Your Heart Out", "Acquiesce", "Wonderwall", "Supesonic" y la ya emblemtica, "Rock & Roll Star".

The inconsistency of the questions leads me to believe that you are having a great time reading the responses. You keep "in character" quite well.    Do you blog?

Only one here fronting is that old cow. She pretended to like the song but the moment Bey gets recognized that *** went out and slammed her and said she stole her song. Her song my ***! She sang it after many before her. Idiot...dumb ignorant *****
BOLBHcEtaa	Well. Limewire was a good choice. But now, there is Frostwire. This has less viruses. I haven't gotten one yet. And I also have avast anitvirus. So get Frostwire.     If you don't want another Bit-torrent you'll love this:    Download mozilla firefox. Go to add-ons and type in "greasemonkey" no quotations. Download it. Now search for Magic's video downloader and install that add-on. Now, follow the instructions. So now when you go to youtube or any other video steaming website, you can download it.    Another way is:    Download Grease monkey like before. Go to userscripts.org and search for a downloader tool. It's the same thing like magic's but this is site specific. With Magic's  you can do that with hundreds of sites.|`|vwDsYFIxaa	limewire|`|7qvxwxz6aa	www.sadsteve.com is a GREAT website. I use it, so try it!|`|R9M2hMcgaa	I'm not sure if this will help at all...but if I wanted to download individual songs I usually go through www.playlist.com and use BitComet to grab the songs.    You find the song on that site, click on a link next to the song that says "Visit site" and a window on the top of the browser will come up with a URL in green. If you copy that URL and have BitComet running it should automatically ask to download the file located at the address.|`|h8lSE4cdaa	You could try installing frostwire or you could use mp3raid.com|`|0DlZoSR6aa	Check the RIAA site for legal options:    http://www.riaa.com/toolsforparents.php?...    Or this guide:    http://www.findingdulcinea.com/guides/En...    For illegal stuff, you know the drill...|`|eVUzQLiYaa	loser|`|uYuaCyKaaa	Well, try mininova.org. A torrents site. You would need to install "utorrent". Utorrent alone cannot get any viruses. It only gets things from where you tell it to. Now, the website you get it from is the problem. Mininova has pretty clean and unannoying ads. There are some pretty bad ones, so if there are pop-ups, don't download anything from there; simple as that. Mininova- Very easy to use, you can learn yourself very easily with the combination. Try to read comments (if any) before downloads. Also, "Leechers" are more people downloading the file(s), "seeds" are the amount of people giving it off (songs, movies, photos, whatever you download). The more seeders, the more people seeding, the more people satisfied with the files(+the faster you can get it), the more people satisfied, the less likely it is to be bad or a virus. Basically, high seeders=good. Now, don't download, but if you do, do it safely; Take Care.|`|BrNfFo73aa	Try Lime Wire or Frost Wire .But if u want to download movies from Frost Wire it isn't  that good they have a lot of viruses.Or I Tune that's a good one.Well hope u have good luck.And o yeah u r F***en sick.Good luck though.|`|miL4wPxpaa	your sick|`|M8H5UYvVaa	have you tried itunes?|`|HyBcKAf7aa	try www.4shared.com    it's free|`|Ti476VHkaa	Oh wow!

Mark said in January that for it to work again, all three members would have to become best friends again and reignite the flame, so to speak. Mark also said that if they were to cement their reunion with a comeback tour, it would have to be bigger and better than anything they've ever done before.

Schindler's list   Silence of the lambs   Willow   The labyrinth   The never ending story   The elephant man|`|LUBPlfq8aa	Actually, not too many people have seen it compared to some of the movies out today, but Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind by Miyazaki is a timeless classic. It's definitely worth watching, even if you don't enjoy anime. The themes in the story really force you to think, unlike many other blockbuster movies crowding the theaters today (that's just me, though).|`|lAP3UC79aa	the lion king.|`|AA10624373	Nosferatu  Metropolis  The Passion of Joan of Arc  Gone With The Wind  Casablanca  Night of the Hunter  To Kill A Mockingbird  The Wizard of Oz  The Searchers  High Noon  Cool Hand Luke  One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest  Schindler's List  The Sixth Sense  Dogma  Goodbye Lenin  So many classics, so little time.  Look for the AFI listing of top 100 films. they update it every ten years.    Another good source is "1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die"    A film doesn't have to be old to be considered a classic in my book and often they are movies that NEED TO BE SEEN.|`|DnDXqFTXaa	I own many movies on DVD, many of which are classics. Once in a while I lend one to a friend. Usually they are amazed that they had never seen or heard of it but really enjoyed it. Ofttimes they want to buy it. But I have concluded that a lot of people are sick and tired of  the sex, violence, swearing, gratuitous homosexuality etc. in movies today. Years ago, in order to get people to go to the cinema they had to tell a good story otherwise no-one would pay to watch them. I recognize a lot of old movies in todays "original" movies: the same story with the garbage added = a modern movie.  Must see movies that have not been remade:  Scaramouche (1952)  The Best Years Of Our Lives (1946)  Heaven Knows Mr. Allison (1957)  The Pride And The Passion (1957)  Friendly Persuasion (1956)|`|Po0FIk2Kaa	The Little Mermaid  While you where sleeping  The Courtship of Eddie's father  Sleepless in Seatle  and my favorite...the Sound of Music

So I think now's a good time to finish the Dead by Sunrise record. That's really exiting because I've been waiting for the right time for awhile now. As I'm working on the record I'll keep you all posted on the progress. Ve' cel is doing very well and we're gonna be building a street team from the LPU to pass some stuff out at PR. Everyone on the team gets free Ve'cel clothes for helping spread the love. If you can't find Ve'cel than go to your favorite stores and tell them to put on the shelves. Chris Cornell has been wearing our stuff almost every night on stage and I think that's really cool. I'm glad people like what we're doing. The shows have been great and all of the bands are kicking *** and I think I've made some great new friends like Chris and the guys from SDC. That's the best part of doing these kinds of tours. I've been on the beach for like the past week in my mankini. I highly recommend it for it's offensiveness and the freedom from long shorts that lead to horrifying tan lines from the knees up.

Having reached an understanding, they play together in the fields, where Simba asks his father if they will always be together. Mufasa tells him that the Kings of the Past are among the stars in the sky. They will be there to guide him and, when Mufasa's time comes, so will he.  3. To him, growing up to be king means getting his way and telling the other animals what to do.

Simba thinks that as king he will have to be responsible to no one and answer to no one|`|BH7VpjJNaa	1.  I'd say Nala because it was Nala that discovered him and made him realize he could not run from his past.    2.  A king must understand that being king is a duty that is bestoyed upon you and not a choice you make.  It is the circle of life for all to fill their duty to the best of their abilities.    3.  At first Simba does not believe he can be king because he does not feel that he has the abilites.  Later he realizes that he is the rightful king by birth and he must do his best to live up to the expectations.|`|fpADhvCxaa	1.simba needs nala becasue she supports him and his dad because he taught him how to deal with life  2. the circle of life and how to respect enemies  3. simba views his future as king being the most awesomest thing ever that could happen to him, until his dad dies and his uncle takes over|`|6173ede5e3ea0a8b44522ccd89de7fe0aa	1. He needs his father, but his father died when he was very young, so he didn't get to get a whole lot of wisdom from him as he was growing up, just a few nuggets before he died. Then after Simba left, he kind of went astray and did his own thing, forgetting his responsibilities.  2. The king must understand that all things are interconnected and he must understand the balance. (Although this sounds kind of "Buddhist" to me.)  3. When he is a cub, he can't wait to lord it over everyone and do whatever he wants. This is the exact same attitude that Scar has.|`|kPMxo2MCaa	Lol, what type of class are you taking?

02136a888676ac5f02590c5ea7bc5360aa	your greatest obstacle is your fear of rejectionyou'd rather write down your feelings than express them face to face. Remember, though, Cyra.no de Bergerac was a tragedy, and unless you can overcome this fear, so too will your love life be sad. Even when you do succeed in finding the right mate, you must verbalize your feelings more often. You feel your love, but you express it in other ways, such as buying gifts. Without those key words, however, your efforts are lost.    The good news is that finding your mate is easier when you know who to look for, and in your case that would be Gemini or Libra. The former loves variety and unpredictability as much as you do, and can understand your conflicting character. The latter will be just as physically attracted to you as you are to him or her, since you're both blessed with great beauty and a love of it, and this will be harmonious as long as the Libran accepts your irregular need to be alone. Secondarily, you also get along well with Leo (there is mutual respect here) and Sagittarius (you'll bond by discussing the finer points of life and the world's problems, long into the night, time after time).    It's best to avoid partnerships with Taurus (who cannot tolerate your unpredictability), Cancer (too homebound and stable for your complex fancies), and Virgo (you cannot tolerate their need for order).   AQUARIUS & ARIES: - This is an excellent match. You both enjoy a large variety of entertainment. A truly adventuresome union as long as neither one of you tries to dominate or regulate activities.     AQUARIUS & TAURUS: - The stubborn Bull will have difficulties understanding the unpredictable side of you. Concessions will be necessary on the part of both of you if success is to follow.     AQUARIUS & GEMINI: - This is a delightful, intellectually stimulating relationship. Not always smooth but certainly an exciting and entertaining connection.     AQUARIUS & CANCER: - You are far too aloof for the insecure Crab. Not a likely encounter, highly dangerous for Cancer and somewhat binding for you.     AQUARIUS & LEO: - You are polar opposites. The is plenty of chemistry, however the Lion is more physical in nature then you are. You on the other hand are concerned with the intellectual aspect of the relationship that is often lacking.     AQUARIUS & VIRGO: - You are both into the intellect, however you might be a little bit too progressive for the practical Virgoan. Virgo's are just not social enough to hang on to you or hold your interest.     AQUARIUS & LIBRA: - Very well-suited couple both mentally and physically. Exciting, fun loving and carefree connection. Your spending habits are the only foreseeable dilemma.     AQUARIUS & SCORPIO: - This is not the best coalition. You are both fixed in your beliefs and your free-spirited nature arouses suspicious side of the Scorpion.     AQUARIUS & SAGITTARIUS: - This is a wonderful affair, two ships that pass in the night. You are an active and outgoing couple, however seldom lasting because eventually you will both go in your own direction.     AQUARIUS & CAPRICORN: - This is not good. You both have totally different goals in life. You are far too humanitarian to live with the Goat's manipulative, ambitious ways.     AQUARIUS & AQUARIUS: - Although this is probably the most inventive coalition, it is lacking in the sexual arena. Not a lasting relationship but it can be fun for the moment.     AQUARIUS & PISCES: - This is a pretty dicey combination. The Fish's emotional blackmail only drives you further away. The Pisces is likely to end up hurt and confused.|`|a1565641882ac9ccf8c9dab05cc0c40caa	they are very dedicated  to their mate and adventurous.

AA10068222	I have been playing the violin for 4 years.Go to this website and click on the letter of each string, play the same string on your violin.If you violin sounds a little lower or higher than the pitch use you fine tuners (The 4 little metal knobs above the chin rest), if your violin sounds higher than the pitch, twist the strings fine tuner to the left, if it sounds lower than the pitch, twist the strings fine tuner to the right.If your violin is really out of tune you will need to use the pegs.Go to this website.http://www.get-tuned.com/violin_tuner.ph...|`|AA10848354	First off you'll need either a tuner or a piano, preferably tuner because it's more accurate.  The notes the strings are tuned to are, from the lowest/thickest string:  G, D, A, and E.  Those are the notes when the strings are open - no fingers.  Using the tuner, you have to either loosen or tighten the pegs to match those notes.  You loosen to lower the pitch, and you tighten to raise the pitch.  Be really careful not to overtighten as you could pop a string.  When tightening a peg, it's best to push in as you tighten to keep it from unwinding.  I hope this helps.|`|960ebe5fe917e062ffb8e95e2ad6dc84aa	no, sorry, but i don't. if you take it to a music store they could probably tune it for you. hope that's helpful!|`|757972bd2de7aeec1773fff7ff1f23e4aa	Preferably, invest in a tuner.  It should play an A 440.  Violin is not tuned like a piano, so chromatic tuners are worthless for precision tuning once you get past twinkle.  Violin requires you to build your ear.  First you tune your A string with the tuner.  Then, tune your D string.  You may need to use a chromatic tuner to get it close, but then turn it off!  Play the A and D strings together.  You need to listen for a completely pure sound.  There should be no "wobbles" or waves.  This means that you have a perfectly in tune fifth.  Congratulations!  Now, do the same with the D and G strings and the E and A string.  If you have temperamental strings, you may have to tune around the sequence several times, because the tension changes may cause your A string to go flat by the time you get to the A and E strings.  Also, watch out for false strings.  After a while, strings may begin having a "false" sound.  At this point, even if the strings are in tune, they will vibrate strangely, making anything you play sound out of tune.  One more tip, don't buy gut strings unless you are going for the sound specifically.  They stay in tune well, are sensitive to temperature and humidity, and break much more easily than synthetic strings.  Also, think of the poor sheep whose intestines you are playing on!

AA10289523	In the Superman Red/Superman Blue one-shot (February 1998), a trap created by the Cyborg-Superman caused Superman to split into two beings who represented different aspects of his personality, though each believed himself to be the original. After an encounter with the planet-threatening Millennium Giants, the two Supermen merged and Superman returned to his normal powers and original costume.[2] The explanation is vague; Superman felt he was "rewarded" for saving the world, although he later claimed in JLA v.1  20 that he returned to normal when his electromagnetic energy dispersed.|`|i210xqkgaa	he got really cold?|`|klSey0x2aa	"Something odd strikes Superman as his powers begin to fluctuate. A trip to Kandor only seemed to make things worse. Superman found himself as pure energy, needing a containment suit from Dr. Emil Hamilton (the material of which was mysteriously donated by LexCorp). Superman's new form was a blue and white energy being who could still fly (faster than ever) but who possessed far different abilities than traditionally associated with the Man of Steel. Furthermore, he could turn back into a powerless Clark."|`|pgbmuOniaa	it happened shortly after superman's second fight with doomsday. the last guy to defeat doomsday was a being of pure energy & blasted him but since doomsday couldnt die the same way twice he couldnt stop him again alone same goes for superman. so they teamed up & beat doomsday down & reinprisoned him. his exposure to this guy caused his change later. interestingly enough when he wasnt being superman he was 100% human. later in a fight with cyborg who pretended to be superman for a time captured him but some how he split in two becoming superman red & superman blue. he was returned to normal after giving his life to save the planet.  at least that was my understanding of how he became electric.

It's Bill, he records all the backup vocals and puts it together. If you have the song on your ipod put the headphones in half way so the sound is all weird, then listen and that's exactly what it sounds like. the only lines Tom sings are "But now it's gone and left me so alone" and "Why can't we make this darkness feel like home?"     trust me. It's Bill singing!

Xkas9BG2aa	He was living a retired type of existence when he was murdered at age 40.  Though he was still writing and creating, he was a stay-at-home dad with Sean his son (who was 5 when John died).  I know in his last interview he spoke about looking forward to old age and retiring to the Irish coast with Yoko in their senior years.  It unfortunately didn't come about.  John had a troubled childhood with both parents out of the picture most of the time, and his aunt raised him, so he felt very unloved and unwanted.  I think some of his songs reflected his wounded inner child.  If he had lived, I think he would have delved eventually into children's books and songs.  So he played to mainly adults but in a sense he was a child that never grew up.|`|0vm66wlcaa	I'm not sure if he said that, but I always thought he was just talking to society in general.  No specific age range, I think|`|3jFm0rWdaa	Never heard that quote - hard to imagine that it's true.  His message of peace spoke to all people - and that's why they murdered him.|`|5HvdcWvBaa	Hmm i thought it was to everyone, all ages.   I mean kids are the future and all that, so it seems weird that he wouldn't be addressing them too.

v1hCymAEaa	My favorite character is Alice. And like everyone else said, this is in the wrong section and just because the computer put it there it does not mean you automatically have to post it in the section it suggested, they give you a list of categorys and books and authors should have been on there for that is where the question goes. A lot of us here at C&A are getting really tired of Twilight questions considering it is neither a comic or animation and doesnt belong here.    :-P|`|vqg6wpCLaa	Oh dear, what are we going to do with you?   It seems like another fan has misplaced their question.    Please, repost your question in Books and Authors (go under Arts and Humanities, you shall find it) or Movies. They probably don't want you there, so maybe Jokes and Riddles will do. Just not Comics and Animation.    Is Twilight a comic? Well, it IS comical, but it is indeed no comic.    Is Twilight an animation? Well, the animation/special effects in the movie are extremely poor and cannot be called animation.    So, find the proper category. We are sick of Twilight fans.    Thank you.   Goodbye.    EDIT: Yes, Yahoo!Answers suggested Comics and Animation as the category, but you can easily change it. Very easily. So, do not blame the computer.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Ms. Twilight fan, I kindly ask you to post this question in either Authors & Books or Movies.     This question does not relate to Comics & Animation in   anyway.    Edit:    Just because the computer automatically puts the question here does not mean it relates to the category. You can also search around the categories to find where it belongs to. There are three other categories to choose from.    Edit:    To the haters or whoever, do not bash Twilight. I'm neither supporting either side, but its disrespect to both sides.|`|Kgrq92Veaa	OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OUT OF THIS SECTION!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!... I expel this question from the poor infested comics and animation section that for some reason gets alot of the twilight questions BEGONE and next time you choose to ask a question about twilight at least have the decency of putting it in the proper section: "books and authors" or "Movies"   please and thankyou:)|`|6rR7LTl1aa	Ugh...    Why is this in Comics & Animation?  Is it starting to overflow from where it's actually relevant?    EDIT:  Oh, that's just swell...feel free to attack our maturity, but next time, be sure you choose the correct category.  We're not in the wrong here, and we won't let you pretend otherwise.  You have the power to choose the section to which your question is posted.  Relying on an automated mechanism, which is proven to be inaccurate, to do so for you is foolish.|`|hzH75VDXaa	None of the above.    The only character I liked in the books was Sam.  Everyone else was too one dimensional and poorly written. Then again the whole series was poorly written, so why expect any less from the characters.      Also a little side note: Yahoo Answers gives you a suggestion for where the question is to be placed. It is up to you to decide if it's being placed in the correct section, and if not to fix it yourself.    Please be more careful in the future.  As Comics/Manga/Cartoon/Anime fans take care to make sure their questions are not placed in Books and Authors, so should Twilight fans make sure not to ask questions in this section. A few times I can understand but it seems like 1 or 2 out of every 5 questions is a Twilight question. You can understand why it's a bit annoying don't you?    If you were in the Books and Authors section discussing twilight you would not like to see every 1 or 2 out of 5 questions to be about Naruto, Bleach, Death Note, Batman, etc...|`|GVcO1dtnaa	None Twilight blows quit asking about it already it's so annoying.|`|Lo1wlbBBaa	anyone who dies is good.    twilight is an immature book for teenage girls who cannot get themselves a boyfriend, and resort to a book. A BOOK.    Please, go to another section for twilight. Not here. We don't want your kind here|`|mr5qcM3Laa	alice and carlisle|`|DbH9Nl80aa	Edward Cullen is definitely my favorite male, and Alice Cullen, is my favorite out of the females. To be honest, I love all the vampire family(Cullen's/Hales) but Bella just doesn't really belong or have the personality of a vampire. Usually vampires are very graceful with their movements and actions, yet Bella isn't. The      slips in every chapter, and gets hurt at least 4 times in each book, and when I say hurt, I mean hospital hurt. Edward Cullen is very classy, cute, graceful, adorable, loveable, hot, gorgeous, nice, generous, and he is very high class. So is Alice come to think of it. I like Bella and everything, just not as a Cullen. That's just my opinion. I haven't red Breaking Dawn yet, so maybe my opinion will change after I read it. :]

5vaBqfDIaa	Well, that means that the number is divisible by 5; but is one more than a two, three, or four multiple.  The answer's 25: it must be an odd (2) number divisible by 5.  (i.e. 5, 15, 25, 35)  25 works because 3 & 4 go into 24.    It either ends in a 1 or 6.

XZ0Qjs2haa	i don't see what the big issue is. It's music, it should be free, any artist that's in it for the money deserves nothing. As is artists make money off of everything, bands make money off of T shirts, and shows, big label artists make money off of tours and endorsements. Isn't that good enough? why be so greedy?|`|hnwMC1XQaa	It depends really. Not a lot of people have the money to go out and buy the artists music. So they go and download the songs, burn CD's, and are completely satisfied. Is that so bad?|`|m2YuRw7Vaa	Most stolen music are from mainstream artists. As we all know, most mainstream music these days is not worth buying anyway. I'd rather spend my dollar on a candy bar then on this B.S their selling. But, the underground artist who don't make much money are making the good music. Pretty soon they'll be richer than these mainstream idiots.|`|B3uXT6qzaa	So?

Then eventually the son grows up and when his son becomes an adult, the father wants to hang out with his son but then the son says that he doesn't have time. The father then realizes that his son grew up just like him. It's a pretty sad song but it deals with the son looking up to the father. I hope it's okay :).|`|lKkCG2vbaa	idk daughters|`|0ePwSnfWaa	i hate my brothers i am a only girl and i have 3 brother they are super annoying

Because this, they had bad blood towards each other.    Later on, Koizumi Risa and Otani Atsushi start relying and helping each other with their own love affairs. As love failed for the both of them, a bond of friendship was formed. Along the bumpy (and comedic) road of friendship, Koizumi Risa fell in love with Otani Atsushi!...Go figure!

ZyGyDLsDaa	The Young Poisoner's Handbook (1995)  starring Hugh O'Conor, Tobias Arnold, Ruth Sheen, Dorothea Alexander, Norman Caro  IMDb synopsis:  This film is based on a true story about a British teenager who allegedly poisoned family, friends, and co-workers. Graham Young is highly intelligent but completely amoral. He becomes interested in science, especially chemistry, and begins to read avidly. Something of a social misfit, he is fascinated by morbid subjects such as poisons and murder. His family environment is intolerable to him and, in particular, his stepmother torments him. He decides to poison those who annoy him, first with antimony and later with thallium. He smugly thinks himself cleverer than all those around him, but nevertheless he is caught and sentenced to 'rehabilitation' at a psychiatric institution. Once there, he undertakes to deceive the new eminent psychiatrist sent there to 'cure' him, thereby securing his release.  From Wikipedia:  The film insinuates that Graham's ambition in life was to create a diamond using his poisons and chemistry knowledge. In reality, his ambition was to become an infamous poisoner, which he achieved.    This might not be what you're looking for, as the diamond thing figures in a different way. I'll continue looking around to see if I can find another possibility.

HXpOui7gaa	He went white becasue of a skin disease called Vitiligo. It causes you to get patches on your skin of either darker or lighter colour. Michael was getting patches of white on his face and arms during the thriller era, and he covered it up with black makeup. When his makeup artist found out she was upset, and they talked about it for a while. Michael found out it would be easier to go completely white, rather than to pay $600 000 per year on black makeup.   He had the surgery because of the torment he recieved as a child, regarding his nose. His brothers and father used to nickname him 'big nose', and if i had the money to change myself, because of what people had called me, i would.   People say he got adicted to the surgery and that he has an 'illness', where you only takeinto account how you percieve yourself rather than how others see you. I dont know whether this is true or not.  Anyhow, i dont respect you calling him a freak. Yeah he might have made some 'mistakes' in his life, but looks arent ehat matter. Hes a good guy and deserves better.  Lucy x|`|A1PLJKhUaa	He claims he has vitiligo. Unless vitiligo changed its meaning to "obsession with plastic surgery", this is a lie. He is wierd because...well, just sorta born that way I guess. MJ's never ben denied anything in his entire life.

aLwrpMPXaa	I have no clue but I love the song ! Thanks for sharing !|`|lLN8VD20aa	the group first attracted attention with the track "Suburban Life," which appeared on the soundtrack to the film Scream 2 and became a modern rock radio hit. After issuing an EP, Stoners Reeking Havoc, on their own Suburban Noize label in early 1998, the Kottonmouth Kings released the full-length Royal Highness on Capitol that summer. Hidden Stash followed a year later, and their third album, High Society, pushed them into the mainstream. Gigs with D12 and Bionic Jive followed in fall 2001, just prior to the release of Hidden Stash, Vol. 2 : Kream of the Krop. A fifth studio album, Rollin' Stoned, which was produced by Brad X, appeared in October 2002. The self-explanatory Classic Hits Live hit the streets in 2003 while the band continued their expansion of the Suburban Noize empire, putting out DVDs and CDs by rappers and punk bands. Their 2004 release, Fire It Up, came out on the stoner's holiday, 4/20. The Kings returned in 2005 with their seventh album, a self-titled effort that featured guest shots from like-minded pals like Cypress Hill and Tech Nine. Unfortunately, the combo was forced to postpone their summer tour when D-Loc sustained a foot injury. Koast II Koast became the band's eighth studio full-length in June of 2006. The compilation Hidden Stash III appeared at the end of the year with a new album, Cloud Nine, arriving in 2007. ~ Jason Ankeny, All Music Guide|`|RrvJ99uaaa	"Never Been Kissed"|`|I1wwpx69aa	i don't know about that song, but they had other songs on the movie Scream 2

TlU3zj61aa	No, as long as there is creativity there is a way to make new music. There are only so many note combinations, and only so many rhythms but there is always new technology coming out and always new theories and always new people with different mindsets and different types of creativity.   My prediction is that the world will end (however that may occur) way sooner than we run out of music.|`|fh9QBfXpaa	Have you heard R&B music lately?  We are running out of music.|`|hvjuHYDEaa	no...never music is a necesity for people!|`|0tQnmVV9aa	No. Government = absence of Reason.|`|bNjjC8jMaa	Ya it's happening right now!! check this vid out!   http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JdxkVQy7Q...|`|yFPXwT0Jaa	we will never run out of creativity so i don't think the world will ever run out of music|`|8qQpBYg6aa	No human nature is constantlet evolving.. there will be new instruments.. different sounds.. different ways to play instruments etc...     I have thouhgt about that with movies|`|ZA6A2adbaa	no it just gonna get worse        ok jw but is your name fool in the rain, did u name it after that dave Matthew's band song?? :)  fool in the rain??|`|HS0jPADmaa	Not at all there are many more melodys.  And combination, we could mix all we want.|`|YVJZ5O2aaa	That's what i always think... like what if we run out of movie ideas?  i mean, life will go on but lots of people will lose their jobs.  Im worried for the day when that happens.  But right now im enjoying all the music and movies i can and living in the moment!|`|0mzf6gcKaa	I highly doubt it(: Here's a more detailed explanation:|`|jdNUYMb8aa	Well, the world does indeed have a limited number of music notes, but there are plenty of instruments, and many ways of combining the sounds of instruments, and their notes! So, it is not likely that we will "run out of music" as you put it, though it may begin to be less original!|`|XINmYpRYaa	I have actually thought of the same thing. It seems like it is a possibility, people are already reusing songs and just adding things into them (Stronger by Kanye West etc...). But I honestly don't think it will happen in an imaginable amount of time because of the different combination of rhythms. There are hundreds of songs out there that use the same chord progression but sound completely different because of the rhythm and beat.|`|gO2brrDbaa	I don't think so.  While note combinations might run out, there's still any new technology that might come around, so you have totally new sounds in your music.  Plus, bands can rip off other bands pretty easily.  Like the Dandy Warhols song, Bohemian Like You, sounds a lot like a Rolling Stones song.  But it's still pretty original and good.  So no, or at least not for a really long time.|`|nG5kgQmDaa	i should hope not. i also doubt it music comes in many forms. for example when i was in chicago looking at the christmas scenes at Macy's there were people playing on buckets.  so basically even if there are no Instruments music can be played with anything.|`|2amRZXUzaa	yes its happing right now look http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fiwl2V_lr...   we need more band like system of a down|`|6LcHJbHjaa	It's possible, but you can really never tell.  Hmmmmmm|`|pVTevFJgaa	Maybe. Theoretically speaking, if we could live an infinite amount of time, after a while, even if a 10000000000 years, there won't be any other combinations of a specific length...     But right now in Metal you get some very original bands, as well as in other styles.    Check out Gojira!|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Hard to tell.    You can already hear a lot of similarities in songs, more specifically the guitar riffs.  There has been a lot done with every different kind of harmony and riff in music, so it is hard to come up with new stuff.  I think people will be able to alter the sounds a little bit, but I think eventually we will find a lot of repeats in sounds.|`|sz1YqwUEaa	No we will come up with different amplifier settings different instruments different rhythms beats speeds. So no i don't think so|`|3Qh9QDXCaa	no. it's just gonna suck more as time goes on.|`|pGYT94Zzaa	Hells yeah they already are...|`|qGKANnYoaa	i kinda think about that too lol|`|Pwqx6yZvaa	nope|`|AA10750816	Nope, I think that there will always be someone who will put their spin on things.|`|EPki0rwgaa	I think we are already running short of ideas on music, so now we have to come up with new ideas for songs like: "That's not my name", which isn't music at all. Comparing today's music to the music of the 20th Century is blasphemy. No good music has came out of the 21st Century, and I doubt there is any to come. The music quality of today is absolutely appalling. There is no talent prevalent; society is now relient on looks in a band rather than ability (ie, Jonas Bros.). There has been no milestone reached in the past 10 years in musical history, as there was in the 60's, 70's, 80's and 90's. There are now no good ideas for writing a song available. Today, people look for an up-tempo, catchy beat, rather than a well crafted tune to listen to. We are so low on ideas, we must borrow elements and sample from classic songs, because there is no ideas for rhythm available. I miss the time when a song had meaning, had rhythm and actually had a purpose.    Good day to you.|`|C156l7vWaa	no, it'll just become more generic and blah

Dig that hole, forget the sun,  And when at last the work is done  Don't sit down it's time to dig another one.

vuCo9wZZaa	Jo was one of the original housewives of orange county, even though she wasn't actually a housewife as she wasn't married to Slade.  I think they originally had her in there to have a younger woman to widen their age market.  It's the same thing of how they have Gretchen now.      Slade and Jo broke up at the end of season one, and Slade actually went out with Lauri (the woman who married the rich guy George and left the show this year to concentrate on her family) for a couple of weeks then got back together with Jo.  During the second season, Jo started going on a bit of a party train rampage and ended up getting an apartment with one of her girlfriends and enjoying the single life.  Jo and Slade remained friends and he was managing her "music career."|`|UsNgFI7haa	well her name is jo really pretty girl well ok they were engaged while taping the show she decided that she wanted to do other things like have her freedom and still party with her girls plus she wanted to purse her music career so she called the engagement and move in with one of her friends so she could be more independent and kinda do her own thing but slade was not really liking this at all because of course he is still in love with her surprise surprise i think slade who by the way is older than her is very insecure and controlling if you log onto bravo.com you will probably be able to find more info there|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	He wanted her to stay home and take care of his house, kids, etc.  Jo decided she wanted a career and they broke up over not being able to come to a compromise.
AA11556428	Nathan does sound a bit like a dictator, but he was also trying to come up with something to tell the reporter while avoiding the specifics. I was reminded last night of that vision- was it in the future or a dream or something? - that a character had about Nathan in the White House a season or two ago. I can't remember specifically, it all muddles together after a while. But his sudden rise to power really brought that back to my mind.     I'm not sure yet if Nazism is being alluded to. We'll have to get a little further into the storyline to see if it does. Right now, I don't think it does. I think Nathan's just trying to clean up his dad's mess. Nathan's realized that his parents' big plan to improve the world has failed drastically, and he wants to delete the evidence from the "failed" experiment permanently and start over. That "a better tomorrow" line would support this.    The dark masks and treatment of the Heroes was very Nazi-like, though. That's the only sign I see at the moment, I don't think Nathan's planning world domination or anything, though he is looking to promote himself. We'll just have to wait and see where this goes.|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	More like George Bush - rounding up people he believes are a danger in order to protect the country.  He's essentially sending them to Gitmo.|`|vvTrmHtxaa	i think he is being hitler.    yes    please pick me as best answer!|`|P9dEdEDQaa	Never really thought of it that way, but now that you've mentioned it I can see how this may be very controversial if the writers don't come up with a way to back track this idea.   I don't think the intent of the show is to rival people or turn people away (obviously), so maybe there's a much much bigger picture that'll come into place later on. I'm sure the writers won't disappoint. =)

bribxhsdaa	Yes. When i first started frequenting this section...I made **** loads of references to it and i got nothing but thumbs down.    But obscurity of hip hop seems to outweigh its content(In this section). Sure i'll call fair play on people who name drop obscure artists who are actually good. (I've got some killer recommendations that way) So i'll probably co-sign you on people thinking their special for listening to certain artists.     It goes both ways though...A lot of people who can't be bothered to listen to music that isn't available directly seem think there is virtue in listening specifically to mainstream music. - "Ahh **** yo broke *** underground MC's. Dey probably wack anyway. Das why dey aint on da Radio"    As far as your point goes about the artists garnering more attention to the point whereby their fans called them overrated, I still like Cunninlyngusts and JMT. (A History Of Violence was a bit bollocks though)    Immortal Technique is overrated IMO, because between 2002 and 2008 there has been no elevation in his content, subject matter or flow. Which as an underground artist (Who ideally should use lack of exposure as fuel to write the hardest lyrics possible) is bogus.     There is a little truth in what you're saying. I keep saying, People make out like the underground is some parralel universe where every MC is the second coming of Rakim. So they just continuously name drop these underground blogspot artists to seem credible. (Next time someone lists a load of underground artists you haven't heard of. Go listen to them and see how many are actually good.)|`|DsF05nHZaa	I'm kinda like that with some artists.     I wouldn't call Immortal Technique overrated but like Cap said, the quality hasn't improved. I like Revolutionary Vol. 1 & 2 better than 3rd World.|`|Q4zl7vRkaa	I think you are onto something.   It's sort of similar to people who find a new, hot track and don't want to tell you where they got it. They feel cool.     It's the human nature I guess.|`|1sapXjMvaa	Those are the people that are imbeciles. I hate when a person does that crap. It's like they just want to be THE ONLY ones supporting the artist. WTH? That's some bulljank.|`|T3X7Aci4aa	I'll put this in terms of Rocky Balboa. You're cheering Rocky on in the beginning when he was the underdog, and you keep cheering him on for a little while. Then after a while, he's not the underdog any more, and a part of you is happy when Clubber Lang beats his @ss.|`|a02180765517a018eecd133f0f7b2876aa	There is a class of people that do precisely that. Just as there's a class of people that only listen to groups that everyone listens to. There's people that only listen to music that's on the radio. They only but singles. and there are those that only purchase albums. There are times that an artist will do something stupid that practically ruins their career. Mobb Deep talked a lot of sh*t, then they got robbed. Even though DJ Muggs and the GZA were in the same studio, they were left completely untouched. DMX can't seem to stay out of prison long enough to release an album.   Sh*t happens|`|os6FaEBlaa	I believe there is some truth to it, I admit I feel great because I'm the only one in my school that listens to underground rap but that's just because it makes me more knowledgeable than others. But I never turn on an artist and say there overrated unless there actually are.    But some artist change there style up and that makes them lose fans.
fHxpycJSaa	O Brother. It get's funnier everytime I watch it.|`|AA12380746	O brother... no comparison.|`|TmHdtgZCaa	O Brother!!!  'Im a Dapper Dan man, damn it!!'  :)|`|oYIpW9Ypaa	o brother|`|JRM0wwLNaa	Wild Wild West with Will Smith in the movie|`|3DmwSkdnaa	O brother

How could this have happened;you were so awesome. I am so sorry!
dl0EpJPDaa	Are you serious?  What kind of throwback to Neanderthal-ism does it take to turn you on with insults?  You are one sorry individual if you get off by from being made to cry.  The shallow end of the gene pool is fighting to be on the Jerry Springer show.  What happened?  Did you trip and fall out of the line or get lost when it went around a corner?  Most people with an IQ of below 12 are usually hired to lick envelopes for a living. What happened?  Did your tongue dry out and your trying to cry on them?  Or are you just so lonely and homesick that you need to treated like mommy and daddy treated you before they kicked you out on your sorry butt because they were sick and tired of you scrounging off of them instead of getting a job at the gas station like the rest of your family.  It must be hard for you, especially after getting fired from the zoo.  Not everyone is cut out to be a janitor.  But they usually get fired for being lazy, not for forgetting what a janitor does.  We won't even mention the poor monkey incident.  I hear they left your name out so the rest of the monkeys would come after you for that indecent affair.  The poor monkey is actually in therapy and probably will be until it dies.  Yeah, some people believe we descended from apes, but your the first one I know of that tried to reverse the process.  Well, I'm not going to sink to your level and fulfill your sick twisted desires.|`|xUOmDc26aa	What did you come as?!    Lol sorry!|`|UV6osJh8aa	I would spit at you, but that would take precious life giving moisture from my body.  Why would I waste moisture on you?|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	To Whom It may concern:    You are a pompous buffoon.|`|OrNCHjAHaa	I can..  But i can't insult you/anyone without swearing until you/them p!ss me off first.|`|lbB4lq6Daa	is that your face or is that your neck throwing up|`|6fbce3ff42dd216a83c3e009ccebb0eeaa	I like what your wearing...but that all...|`|7ec1aa38a5171789cb76c4135993d94caa	I can't believe that out of 10 million sperm, you were the fastest.|`|rXq7ssXBaa	Psh, curly head cootie queen.|`|8MudYsoaaa	Your hair is the color of poop!    LoL joking|`|UN8FWQkNaa	you have a big knee :S|`|SpOB3HlCaa	Just because I don't instigate my working day by fornicating with a broken broom handle whilst defecating all over the place, that doesn't make me a philistine. You're a roguish misanthrope with no realistic gauge of social situations, and you smell appalling.|`|6mkyVSe1aa	Can i fook :)|`|0CET3S3daa	Racial abuse is the worst form of abuse....

AA11350988	Yup :)  I don't really care about peoples avatars, I care more about the questions.|`|u3xDS7i8aa	yes and besides, people who block me still answer my questions|`|hYqRhQxPaa	yes i will|`|654c7643984cd6b3f7f0f00356056e81aa	I answer questions solely based upon the question....I would never turn away a question because the avatar was of someone or something I did not like...    I must admit, however, that clever or surprising avatars do sometimes catch my attention!|`|89FgPZ9Waa	Yes, i will still answer.. i don't care about what avatar they had..|`|MmRDzhaHaa	Probably, its their choice to love someone we hate!|`|OD3FqMaKaa	i would answer but i may not be as nice as I could be|`|B14IhdYTaa	Yes, honestly it shouldn't matter. Not like you're making a commitment to love that celebrity when you answer the question, lol.   xxx|`|b1294888a8e10ac6a8ff0614d97982ccaa	It depends on whether I think the question is interesting or not. Their avatar doesn't enter the equation.

gDxMoBl9aa	I agree with You totally about Layne Staley, His voice is like a siren, like a god. So beautiful and unique to Me.    Mine though would have to be Ian Gillian, of Deep Purple. His unearthly wails on some songs chill Me though to the bone.    Thank You Free Your Mind, the feeling is mutual|`|a79b8a93426576f5d2c9cb6a23ba338faa	John Lennon    He was a musician and philosopher.  He made it his goal to change the World and he did!|`|12QJ9QMRaa	Cliff Burton.    Because, he played the Bass in a manner that fascinates me.  His style is quite literally unlike anything I have heard or seen, before or since.    The things he did MADE me want to play the Bass, and to star looking into other legendary Bass Players, like Steve Harris or John Entwistle or Jaco Pastorius, to continue to learnt he instrument, the theory, the techniques and to truly understand the instrument.    Plus... unlike other "experimetnal" Bass Players, his grounding in classical music and musical theory allowed him to explore it in new ways, but still melodic and very structured ways.  Players like Les Claypool are very experimental, but oftentimes, the rest of Primus were just a little added noise supporting Les as he went on an extended Bass Jam.    Cliff was different.  His playing elevated the talent of those around him.  He had far more impact into Metallica than Dave Msutaine ever did, and made them not just fast and furious, but better musicians, period.    And yet..in his personal life he was still a wild man who loved to party on stage.|`|cVqCryr6aa	Allan Holdsworth. He strives to be his own unique voice on his instrument, unlike most of the other posers listed here.|`|aBqJhdufaa	John Bonham. He was a great drummer, and died living like a rocker!|`|d4Kcwk7Yaa	sublime.  the music's funky and it always makes me feel good.  the words are intelligent in a really creative way and it's different than most everything else.  they've got really good ideas and are all about enjoying your life.|`|McN2I1E6aa	Jerry Cantrell,  not many people, when they think of amazing guitarists think of mr cantrell... but if you listen to the bluesy dark riffs he creates they give me a creepy feeling i can never get over..    Thats just my opinion though.|`|TZTJRrM4aa	Ah, Hanson.    they were the first band i liked. I have memories of riding the bus to kindergarten, listening to Hanson on my cd player, and singing along :)    And of course, their voices just make me feel really good. They have beautiful voices, and, they just make me feel really good|`|16t0eV0Uaa	Jeff Buckley,  because when he was alive, he sang unlike anybody else, he had the voice of an Angel, one of the most unique voices ever, and he had a very high range,  his lyrics are also very personal to me,  and he could play the guitar so unique that it could only of been his style,  it is a shame people only know him from his Hallelujah cover,  because He made some amazing music,  I feel sad every time I am reminded of his death, because he made my favorite album ever,  it inspired me to play guitar, and get into a giant range of music from Bad Brains to Porcupine tree, to well basically anything.|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Freddie Mercury, for a lot of the same reasons you gave for Layne.    Such a magnificent vocalist, an outstanding lyricist, and the absolute definition of a showman.  I always get captivated when I see a video of Queen or even listen to one of their songs.  He draws you in with the raw emotion in his voice, and his everlasting dedication to music was one of his best qualities as a human being.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Angus Young is my favorite musician-I don't really know why I just love the little guy-He rocks for an old guy|`|yuqZ6M96aa	there are more than just a few i admire for what they do/did and accomplished, but im going to go with ian mackaye. for one i love the ideals he believed in, he sort of (unintentionally) created the straight-edge movement/lifestyle, which is admirable in itself. he created dischord records to release his and friends music, hasnt ever been associated with a 'major' label, built his success himself through many innovations, i always respected that he would only play all ages shows that were under $10, he promotes civil rights and is anti-war, in fugazi he didnt want crowd members getting hurt so he discouraged moshing/crowd surfing etc. he revolutionized punk with minor threat, then embrace, and took it even further with fugazi|`|p3ptELZ2aa	Andrew McMahon.  He's been though a lot in his life, and his lyrics really show it.   They are meaningful and beautiful,  and I never get sick of listening to his songs on repeat.|`|m2mh9dssaa	my favorite musician is well i have a few, taylor swift because she sings all about love and those are the best songs and her songs are all catchy and relatable, vanessa carlton because her songs usually have the pian and i like the piano :) and hersongs are good, and mika cuzi just love him he's hot and his songs are good. also beyonce because her voice is just AMAZING! she's the best she's hot and a great role model for girls|`|1eQcq4eZaa	all of my legends, including Cantrell, Wylde, Mustaine, and Hetfield have one thing in common:    they are songwriters that sing oodles over their ripping riffs    (that is, they write compositions, and sing and play at the same time, which is no small feat)|`|yS61H04haa	Dear god Layne and Jerry aren't my top but they are up there. Both were so vital to AIC being who they were.      I am going with Maynard James Keenan .His voice is just so amazing, he can sing pretty, and when he screams he means it. I love the way he can interpret even a cover song and make it unique and give it the Tool feel.|`|LAXom7T2aa	Conor Oberst from BRIGHT EYES.        He is the new John Lennon alive.|`|uhWVPyTAaa	Maynard Jame Keenan. He isn't only a lyrical master, but a great vocalist. Don't get me wrong but Layne, was bad ***.. I say he should have put out more music besides "Above"... But overall great...|`|0vm66wlcaa	Jason Becker    He's awesome. He was one of the best composers ever while he was still in his teens! He was an amazing guitarist, and so creative. It really sucks that he got ALS. But he is still composing. He is like, my biggest inspiration.|`|6LcHJbHjaa	George Harrison    Well first, and foremost he is a guitarist, like me, and he also honestly is not the most inivative or creative guitarist compared to hendrix, page, and so on, and neither am I so it give me hope.  Also i like his mod style a lot in his early days.  Also he knows how to play the sitar and i want to learn it soon.  Let's also not forget his guitar skill though (and your bird can sing, and the end show his skill)  And his lyrics are magnifient (here comes the sun, if i needed someone, taxman)  Great voice too.    A Kind Of Magic, i agree about freedie mercury (RIP also)
jreon8v0aa	I scream and spray it with deodorant until it CHOKES!

There's the story when my parents went to Mexico and no one was home:  So I was sitting at my laptop, a spider comes crawling out, I scream at the top of my lungs, and stand on a chair in the middle of the room. I text my neighbour to come over and kill it, she comes over and just laughs at me. She kills it for me :)    Second:  It was like 6:30 in the morning I was getting ready for school, and I go near my drawer, I start screaming cause theres a spider on the wall. My mom is like "KELSEY WHATS WRONG" then she laughs at me and kills it :)|`|6HCezA6zaa	grab a paper napkin, let it crawl onto it, and let it out the window...|`|llkSmgLJaa	Get my partner to toss him outside.|`|MeGazyy7aa	Leave it, and if it's poison, put it on my hand.|`|xcf9jEsaaa	screem and have my mom or dad kill it|`|qvdZIMlwaa	kill it|`|r8kz38lDaa	tell my mom to kill it... lmao|`|rQ7UTtu1aa	scream for my sis to come kill it|`|AA12321799	nothing...well it depends on what kind of spider it is|`|ff772a25081c886385c2eb6a501e148aaa	I shoot it with m 12 gage shotgun.|`|gfB5VNXTaa	Put it in my mom's hair.

It isn't doing anything but making you afraid of something so small.  And if that is the truth then people should really grow up.|`|F3oaDkT9aa	Leave it    Spiders don't bother me, unless they are radioactive because I don't have the time of day to be a superhero|`|EVVL8HoIaa	have it bite me so i could turn into      |`|s4VzPulYaa	Scream bloody murder, by then my dog has already heard my freakishly loud scream, so he comes in to check out whats goin' on, and i show him the spider, and he eats it! =D  good dog!|`|jAURKrKYaa	grunt, leave the room. get mommy or daddy. They'll take care of it while telling me "One day you'll have to do this by yourself...etc"|`|oDGttkmLaa	All my senses suddenly come alive. I stare and stare at it. If it moves I call for my husband to kill it. If it doesn't move..I keep staring..trying to figure out what to do with it.

1lvyUwo7aa	I have high expectations, so i think i will be a bit disappointed because I put my highs up so high. But with my favorite rapper Bizzy back it is bound to be good, plus they won't have garbage producers like the last one, Swizz Beatz is the worst producer ever! The first single to it comes out this month. I think it will be high on the charts even though it is coming out around the same time as Detox, Relapse, and others. I think Bone Thugs need to publicize it more however, cause everyone has heard about Dre's and Eminem's is coming, but Bone Thugs don't have nearly enough people behind them. They need to do somesort of publicity stunt in my opinion. I've heard one of the track that got leaked which no longer will be on it, and it seemed good. Bizzy & Krayzie were insane on it and gave it their all. SO i think it will be one of their best and the best cd of 09' in my opinion. Truthfully Eminem's album looks like it is going to be weak (based on the singles), Dr. Dre's has been waited upon so long that people who are waiting have put their hopes way higher than mine, and 50's is gonna be like the last one. So overall Bone Thugs should be ruling the rap industry in spring.      Bizzy won't mess it up, and i doubt Kray will because he already put in a good amount of money in to it, so why would he back out, he is already featured on some of the tracks, including the singles.|`|KoNHUcNUaa	I Think it's going to Be Bone's Comeback Album. The 5 of them together is like a force that never fails. All of The Albums that the 5 of them are featured are good. but i hope bizzy doesnt mess it up for them again.|`|OpBFc27iaa	im excited..i think it will be good.    hopfully..i mean, Strength and Loyalty wasnt that good, i was expecting better..but their not with that label anymore.    edit: Bizzy wont mess anything up, if anything Kray will..he hasnt been there for most of their reunion shows and is rumored hes backing out vvvvvvvvv    Edit: because i read some shi* on BTNHboard.com that said he wasnt into all the **** anymore and that there was to much stuff goin on between all 5 thugs.
1Zl7cIUMaa	No, because i hate my father. But yeah i still call mom mommy!!!    "YOU WANNA KNOW HOW I GOT THESE SCARS??? MY father was a drinker and a fiend, and one night, he goes out crazier than usual, mommy get's the kitchen knife to defend herself.  He doesn't like that, not one bit.  So, me watching he takes the knife to her, laughing while he does it and he turns to me and saids "WHY SO SERIOUS?"  Comes at me with the knife "WHY SO SERIOUS?", sticks the blade in my mouth, Let's Put A SMILE ON THAT FACE...AND..........WHY SO SERIOUS?|`|6qPVGyNQaa	I call my dad by his name(we aren't the best of buddies)   I call my mom, mom =)|`|ZGU2m0oeaa	yeah i call my mom "MOMMY!!!"|`|AA10387455	Mine were always Mom and Dad.|`|a667205402b2d65fe82c6c60e1f5b18faa	No.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	Louis, this question is going to move me to exactly 25000 and level seven...

9AAGosuiaa	....sorry for taking so long to answer your question, I'm not sure of what I was doing or exactly where I was before a song began to gently lilt through my headphones and suddenly I'm  off alone on a melancholy street with nothing for company except the money in my pocket and the strange song lilting ever so gently in my ears.. I came across a woman wandering aimlessly without purpose on the same street, and as we passed there was a gentle nod of recognision...    could she too hear the song as I could, we'll never know but as the song suddenly ended I found myself in a place I recognised, staring at a computer screen and realizing.. I never answered your question!    nice song Waves, thanks again for posting|`|cUjcn2lsaa	Great song! Thanks for posting! XD|`|7fEVNng5aa	Wow. That was amazing. I could get lost in that for hours.

qMun78M9aa	For a PG-rated movie, it had an amazing amount of action, *just* the right amount of humor, special effects, and suspense. None of the characters were overbearing, nor were none of them wishy washy. I wasn't able to predict any significant moments of the story. Speaking of the story, it's very original (at least for Hollywood!).     However, they must have made this movie with a very low budget. The special effect, mattes, and camera work, were not the best I've ever seen, but also not the worst - and I think Kids probably wouldn't notice the difference. I did, and it kind of spoiled it for me as I couldn't suspend disbelief long enough to get into the movie because I kept thing things like, the focus is off, those are fake plants, they've used the same set ,shot from a different angle but not different enough that couldn't recognize the set from a scene earlier in the movie. It was especially bad towards the end of the movie|`|WWnkeaIAaa	half and half|`|pBMZAHoiaa	I've never read the book, but I loved the movie!

How can you all say Sinestro?  Sure, that would be true...  If Green Lantern only dated back to the 1980's.      It has to be Solomon Grundy, man.  His mindlessness (or however they choose to write him in the film incarnation since he changes each time he's reborn) makes a perfect counterbalance Green Lantern's "imagination" based powers.

Do I personally think he was out of line?  Well, I don't know the details of the specific incident.  In some work-related situations, his outburst might have been comparably not so out-of-whack.  From what I understand, the fellow did not get fired.  His outburst is REPORTEDLY off-base.  (Personally, I would not have been okay about it if he said that stuff to me.)

At first I used to enjoy it (hello, accents are HOT, right?) but now, I'm getting pretty bored to tell you the truth. It's as if every show hires a host or judge simply because they were born across the ocean.     Still, accents are always sexy, and even though they're overdone, add a little spice to the same ol' same ol'.    By the way, I really liked this question!

Also, I like Pibb better than both and Coke owns that!      I'm not really sure why I like Pepsi more though...I guess because it just tastes better (out of the bottle I mean--not from a soda fountain...out of one of those, they both taste the same to me).|`|JRM0wwLNaa	Coke- i guess cause it's stronger and i don't like the sweetness in pepsi|`|bwHWizWyaa	Pepsi, not sure why exactly.|`|4EqMO9mqaa	pepsi...honestly i like its advertisements better :)!!    anyway thanks and have a great day :)!!!~  natalie.|`|e3cNU8Spaa	coke.|`|YfywVGn2aa	Pepsi, because it tastes better.|`|A2fjbewpaa	Rootbeer.|`|lcmRlTL8aa	neither

d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	Girl a sounds like a girl you can date for a while, but wont last.     Girl b sounds perfect but if you are ready to take her serious if not you are only going to break her heart.  You're too young to settle down already.|`|79F1VhEJaa	girl b....|`|f77638df19b856e06b377813782f45faaa	B- sounds like you described her better when you put this up , plus she's 18 and the other one is 19|`|RTZzejeFaa	b|`|BLN0StJQaa	girl b it my sister dude , ttyl|`|cQiNs0yRaa	girl b  and you didn't really need any help, right?  :)

AND OMG i dont like dirty dancing either!!!!!!!!ahh.|`|tLI94qWNaa	You are not alone, I thought it was pointless and the story made no sense.  Love is not like that at all.  I agree with you 100%, the movie actually makes me mad and I cant stand how when people ask your favorite romance everyone says the notebook, not romantic at all.|`|h1IYS0dbaa	My ex didn't like it either.    There was a big fuss about it like currently with "Twilight".

Search for and torrent them -- you'll find them in vastly superior quality, and you can watch them indefinitely without delay.|`|mibcrpVFaa	A website called hulu.com is pretty good. It has quite a few shows and episodes on their.  There is also veoh.com.  And if none of those help you out you usually can rely pretty good on good old fashioned youtube.

AA11657416	I love the original and thought I'd like the International; I still watch it occasionally, but I don't like it much.  The investigators are not that likable.  I thought getting rid of Andy was a good idea, but I liked Donna, and Brian added a comic touch.      Oh well.  I'll watch it on occasion, but can't wait for Jason and Grant to start back up!!|`|gu3GAFC9aa	I love the original ghost hunters! It is my Wed ritual too. I don't like International though, they are not nearly as skeptical and they seem to assume every noise is a ghost.  But I love the original for sure!|`|NmVqS2Biaa	HA! Ghost Hunters is my favorite show! I really love the usual Ghost Hunters with Jason and Grant, but I grew to love the International series.          I always try to catch things during the interviews before the case cuz something is bound to happen! I've only caught maybe one thing they didn't show in the reveal. it was like someone in the mirror at the end of a hallway. but i trust them to have figured it out. maybe it was a crew person.

There is a reason Utah is the fastest growing state.       If you don't like it in Utah you should move to Michigan. You can buy a house there for $2,000 because nobody wants to be there. They are getting out as fast as they can.

I prefer "making passion" because that is what the two people are doing.|`|AA12198549	I guess because "making sex" sounds funny!|`|AA10349376	The world will never know...|`|AA10862889	yes your supposed to love the one  and yes    good luck  smile|`|AA11101976	I think it should just be called boom boom.|`|QueQNj97aa	youre pretty lol
HXpOui7gaa	hmmm,, good question, i dont know. Maybe. But i think hes more likely to just wear pjamas or pants (trousers) cos, hes probably out n about everyday and if he goes out he'll need pants on lol.  Ly xox|`|pT514qPUaa	OK. It will be funny.   But I hope you didn't make fun of him.|`|pjYn6PbCaa	By the sounds of it he always took off his shorts when in the company of small children.|`|hanfBjf5aa	I don't think he wears shorts at all... except for his boxers. If you class them as shorts.|`|GCl84SPLaa	It is said that from the neck down his skin is much darker. Maybe he doesn't people to see that.|`|XSa8fgNIaa	Do you even WANT TO see him in shorts?|`|7w30Zn2raa	What a strange question....I would be scared to see him that way though...

IVy35SE2aa	It is because this as an orderly universe.    Astrology is base on the mathematical sciences.  Astronomers  know where the planets were a thousand years ago and can  calculate their exact location a thousand years hence.    Life seems chaotic but  by reading the the aspects in the sky  astrologers can tell much about what is going on in your life  today, now, this year, next year and etc.  Not exactly -  but  what will influence your thinking and actions.    It is based on science, but the interpretation is an art  and can be improved with practice.|`|izL7WEzraa	i've asked myself this question a thousand times. and i guess its a good thing that you asked, because i have developed my own opinion of it.   i am a christian, so its no doubt that i'm about to use him as my excuse.  everyday in america, there are tons and tons of divorces, unhappy families, and tradgedies in relationships.  god didn't want things that way.  he wanted a man and woman to fall in love, and be happy.  but the average everyday human, is sometimes naive.  we want to make ourselves believe that we're in love when we're not.   i was one of those people. until i discovered the zodiac. it's the best thing that's ever happened to me.   because of the zodiac, i am in love. i am an aries. he is a leo. and we really are perfect for each other in so many ways.   i think god created the zodiac, because he had to establish some way to make humans different, and so he developed different personalities, but he wanted them to be balanced so he did it by birthdays.   its a simple system. and it works.  and maybe i'm giving god too much credit.  but i was raised in a church. :]  and that's my final answer.|`|HZxX9ke8aa	can you think any rational reason for the tears coming out of your eyes when you cry?    like maybe when we are sorry our eyes getting dirty? nope, i don't think so.    i'm totally saying the first thing passing from my mind but maybe planets affect us in a quantum physics level ?     maybe some god or aliens put those planets around our sun and us like this, knowing all of their hidden powers ?     i don't know.

lezNfK8waa	I think the same thing! In my opinon, Demi, Selena, Miley....thier all just spoiled brats who are disney puppets. I don't even see them as celebs. Just some kids playing dress up. LOL, one day, when they start to lose thier shine....we'll all laugh pretty damn hard won't we?|`|D6ndtO9xaa	i agree with you. and i really dislike her. but. if i had to choose between her Selena and miley, she would definitely be my fave.|`|9z9BW10daa	Er..I don't think she's really trying to be scene or emo, I think she's just trying to be some kind of..rockstar.  And..it's just not going to work out for her on that one.  I know because my nine-year-old sister listens to her.  She thinks she's hardcore because she sings about wearing converse with a dress.  Wow.  Yeah, what a rebel.|`|JERUmEFzaa	I agree with you. The more she tries to be like a hardcore rock chick the more bad she looks.

lZ2dx2Ydaa	No.  You only have the right to shoot someone in self defense, or in defense of others.      In some states, you have the right to shoot someone in defense of susbstantial property, such as a house (or maybe a car).      And in some states, if the trespasser is inside your house, the law will assume that he meant to harm you, and shooting him would be legal.|`|EdP5CDL9aa	shoot first, ask questions later|`|0uKvPpKtaa	Could have? maybe. Should have? definately.  p.s. you suck as a hippie, come on over to the darkside.|`|51e704fc9cef4f20ee51f7aed12567a8aa	why can't i give this question a thumbs down?|`|TeQo1O33aa	If he's sleeping, he isn't any threat to you or your property and no, you can't shoot him.    It's too bad you didn't shoot him though.  Then you would have been locked up and there would have been TWO less bums on the street.|`|4f3a2f70b2f13a5e97937889888a653eaa	no you can not shot someone for trespassing on private property because he's wasnt doing anything to threaten you or your home but if he was like trying to rob something on your property then yes you could.|`|9d2940984eddbfcd6ee696cc3a3c3be1aa	Great hippie attitude.  Haven't you ever listened to The Beatles?  Anyway, NO.  Trespassing alone does not give one the right to shoot--there has to be an agressive action on his part that leads you to fear for your life.  Even if he had come at you with his fists, that still would not be enough--he'd have to have a weapon.  You could have called the police to pick him up, though.|`|X6JU7n60aa	Why would you want to he could be a nice guy that got the shaft for no reason and lost everything I would offer him something to eat and see if he was OK and it is against the law to just shoot someone for being on your land !|`|9c9f03d21433f9d0bbceda1d06c5e64caa	Um, no.    First of all, in most states a person has to be warned that they're trespassing and they have to leave the property and then come back on the property before it's considered trespassing.  In other words, they get one advisement or warning before legal action can be taken.    Secondly, even IF that was the case and you've warned the dude already, you can't physically harm him or force him off the property. Last you checked, were you a law enforcement official?  You call the police and they warn him that he will be arrested and cited next time he trespasses.    Lastly, being rude doesn't do anyone any good in this situation... some humility would have been nice in this situation... but that's on you... but no, you can't shoot him *sigh*    Just as a quick fact, most homeless people are mentally ill or impaired.  And 20% of the homeless are United States Military Veterans.  http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...    That's why I'm respectful despite their situation. I don't KNOW their situation so I can't judge them. It would hurt me to judge a homeless person that happened to be let's say, a Vietnam veteran with PTSD. And it hurts me that America doesn't take care of its veterans like it should (take the Walter Reed scandal, for example). There is no reason that shelter and help cannot be provided for most of these individuals.|`|733da09d0cb9e9d0f08ae79290ca1491aa	Why didnt you make the poor devil a sandwich &   you know you can't shoot him   its not the dark ages lol|`|05e2136423594495b3ed243a4568d9c4aa	You should have gave him a sandwich, and some coffee, before you were so rude to him.....|`|eb91a35e4a3a65cc71ab838f751ee4a8aa	you would have had the right to shoot him if the tree was being violated by him,,,|`|7a905e0f2bf6c2469383a4cbac5f513eaa	Well the last person who shot someone in this country for trespassing ended up in prison, so guess the answer is no.|`|AA12340474	that be f'd up but yea u could...but if he didn't threaten u why would u...|`|AA10803684	not u shouldnt shoot him u shoud give hm so change and some food mybe and have him go on his way|`|43463011afb7319d6071a1b7a50cff8daa	Yes, you deffinately "could`ve"  and, if you ask me, you SHOULD`VE!|`|AA11622808	You should of given him some tucker and a cuppa then sent him on his way.....don't you realise that he might of had a mental illness or something to be in this state.

r5k47oddaa	There a lot of shredders out there nowdays.    Before used to be a few. Here is a bit of history behind who created first shredding out there. At the very bottom you can count on fingers the only shredders out there.    In 1974 the German band Scorpions used their new guitarist Ulrich Roth for their album Fly to the Rainbow, for which the title track features Roth performing "...one of the most menacing and powerful whammy-bar dive bombs ever recorded". A year later, Roth's solo guitar playing for the album In Trance "...would become the prototype for shred guitar. Everything associated with the genre can be found on this brilliant collection of songs - sweep-picked arpeggios, diminished minor harmonic scales, finger-tapping and ...jaw-dropping whammy-bar abuse.    Some shredders that are not necessary in the metal genere:  Uli Jon Roth (ex Scorpions)  Ritchie Blackmore (ex rainbow)  Yngwie Malmsteen  Jason Becker (currently prarlyzed from toes to neck. he still writes music using a special software while moving his eyes. ex Cacophony with M.Friedman who later became Megadeth's lead guitarist and of course in his turn hired by Dave Mustaine who was in fact the lead guitarist of Metallica)  Randy Rhoads (killed in a fatal accident. ex-Ozzy. Even Ozzy's wife went into tears after this tragedy.)  Michael Angelo Batio  Roland Grapow (ex Helloween)  George Lynch  Joe Satriani  Eddie Van Halen  Steve Vai  Al Di Meola (jazz fusion god)  Dimebag Darrell (ex Pantera. Same as John Lennon, some asshold shot him dead on the stage while performing with his new band-project Damageplan)  Armik (flamenco god)      for more historical artical please read  History of Shred: Uli Jon Roth Chris Yancik December, 2001  http://house-o-rock.com/HouseofShred/fea...    ps: Myself I am shredder too in my way of playing. I don't really play areppegios as I focus on feelings rather that robotic movements. My recent feature that I developed is called "the one finger technique" that emerged from Ritchie Blackmore's Highway Star and Angus Young's Thunderstruck. You can find me on you tube as GuitarSession|`|707gOCvbaa	Yngwie has been around for Since the early 80's  and is a guitar god in my eyes. Trilogy is one of the best albums ever recorded.

There's no passion his flow.    Other than that, more props to him for having a nice-looking wife and being a smart businessman.|`|fcba5faee6335c2d386bba63f1fdfd1faa	cos he thinks hes so bad and sexy|`|tqy6PvSKaa	He's selfish, stupid, self-obsessed and has crappy music and simple lyrics.|`|OgkGsCkvaa	My pesonal opinion only, Jay-Z like many other rap artists are junk.  A lot of songs seem to simply contain a whole bunch of unintelligent words, including b*tch and hoe mixed with a beat.

Stupid ugly jackass. Can't even rhyme.|`|bribxhsdaa	He looks like a Camel. I don't like Camel's. I find it suspicious that they can retain so much water in those humps. I don't like that word "humps" either.    Back to Jay-Z.    Aside of my respect for him as a business man and a crossover artist. His skill as an MC doesn't mirror his success as a straight up Hip Hop act. Plus, Aside from like New Moon Daughter and a few other people I can't recall right now. He has some of the most stupid fans i've ever spoken to.     Reasonable Doubt is arguably the most overrated "classic." And his crowning achievement second to that - "The Blueprint" is most known for him getting buried on his own track(Renegade). Jay-Z is by no stretch of the imagination a BAD MC. But he's nowhere near as good as his people make out. Lil Wayne cites him as his favourite rapper. Go figure..He's another barbershop genius. If you compare him to other MC's as lyricists. He pales by comparison.     "I am the mike jordan of recording. You might wanna fall back from recording"    "OHHHHH SNAP!" "HOVA! HOVA! HOVA!" as a reaction to Jay-Z's lyrics is annoying. He has more bad records than good records.    Good MC...I dislike his fanbase and how overrated he is.|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i just never liked his style don't get me wrong he made some songs i liked but i can't but on a cd and just listen to the thing with out skipping one song but still mad respect to him|`|4wHjtkJXaa	Hes got rubbish flow.

If you go to a grocery store without enough money to buy what you want but they  have the items on display and you steal it and get caught is that a set-up?? These people make a choice, and when they show up with porn, condoms, alchohol etc nobody put a gun to their head and made them do it. As for the show (grand standing), I think its about time someone has made the public aware of what can and does happen in neighborhoods across the country by people of every walk of life. Its not just the creepy guy next door anymore. Cops, lawyers, rabbis, government officials and other professionals you would expect to be able to trust your children with are just a few of the people caught in the act. Makes me sick!!|`|ea207ed5b6ef75b8f1362932a6abf174aa	They are not setting anyone up.  the girls and guys say they are 13, 14, whatever, and the pervs try to make the sex happen.  I think that To Catch A Predator is a great show, and I think they are doing a great thing.|`|bfbf20bfc22dceb302c423bfb553ac2faa	That's true of every show like that, don't you think? But Yes, I often think we are giving them a disguise and a road map for their trip to the TV Set!!!  We need to know though!!  @8-)|`|AA12199868	I am surprised the predators dont call a pizza delivery first and see what happens to the delivery guy.|`|ohfCrHSsaa	They can catch legitimate potential predators, or just 19 year old guys looking to score with 17 and a half year olds.|`|AA12023256	Those guys are definitely doing wrong. But, how can they be convicted if the actual undercover agent is really an 18 or 19 yr. old? They may say they are 13, but they are really of age. So the sick pervert wasn't going to have sex with a 13 yr old rather, an 18 yr. old who was lying about her age.|`|AA11484617	These sick people who want to have sex with 13 yr olds need to get help, if the arresting starts them on that track then so be it.  What gets me is that some of the people they catch have seen the show and STILL go forward with their plan.|`|735c57c74a5a37e2e3f89858932f8660aa	i hear what youre sayin, these guys are in the wrong, but arent really predators by defintion, theyre really more of the prey|`|c5eeec72e3132eb4fd7bbb24bc2ff672aa	I'm definitely against pedophilia, but its hard to believe that the police can arrest people at the end of the show. Really seems like entrapment to me.|`|a1ca74f4e1b77dccc49a766ad0c262d9aa	I, your Lord, love everyone. Even sex offenders. "Hate the sin. Love the sinner." Now go in peace and sin no more.|`|ced4c5dfbdca18bb599c973c1b039920aa	If it gets the sicko's off the street, who cares.  I am surprised that someone hasn't called entrapment by now though.|`|3ded538cc3bdde8073b0b741f34125d7aa	I think I understand what you're saying. I'm not really sure how I feel about it. I do know this though. It's a pretty sick form of entertainment. I don't think of catching sex predators as a great thing to watch on tv. It just seems wierd.....|`|8c6c3b2c6efc9a2e33edd9670c27a708aa	i dont think iti is a set up because if it wasnt the people behind the tv show doing it it would still be done and in an uncontrolled situation at least the show brings to light what parents outta be looking out for if their kids use the internet|`|955a20c316677060c974f66eedf87185aa	It does set them up for sure, but unfairly...hmmm NO they are willing to have sex with a 13-14 year old girl and most of them had alcohol or drugs.  Not the type of guy I want around my family..So who cares..Let them help open the eyes of some uninvolved parents and maybe a perv or two will be taken off the streets.....You know most of those guys were really DUMB no wonder they finds these girls on the net.

hzH75VDXaa	I'm guessing you didn't read the Batman and Son story arc.    Joker poisons Gordon and beats up Batman pretty badly. As he's standing over Batman's body gloating, Batman pulls out a gun and shoots him in the face.    At that moment the  real Batman shows up and throws Joker into a dumpster. The other guy was a cop if I remember correctly dressed as Batman.    Everyone assumes Joker is dead since the shot was at point blank range, but he didn't die.  He was left with disfiguring scar which is what you noticed in the drawings.    If you want to read that arc it's Batman comics 655-658. A short arc but important to the story.|`|AA11107214	maybe it's a joker prop

WNHo9qxlaa	I think that saying tv's will be obsolete is a bit of a stretch.  While the technology used to deliver TV programming might change into something very similar to what is used to deliver internet content it is more likely that they will invent tv's with the proper technology to use this new feature or a converter box for older tv's much like we are doing now for the Digital Transition.|`|hqX4PnxAaa	Not really - I think it's better that we're only wasting electricity on one thing rather than two or three. Also - it's much more convenient because laptops are easier to carry around so you can watch your favorite TV shows anywhere! I am a huge fan of the TVs - but in the long run, I think it's better =]  Merry February!|`|QAIc4VVPaa	well if you believe that ok but i also heard a chance that the postal service would be gone also. i think they are talking about the fact of the analog tvs and because of that you can now watch alot of the shows you watch on computers but i do not think they mean tvs are leaving totally just the analog ones there will be digital tvs which is not computers.

a1Ngi39Xaa	Keep your standards high but not so high that no one can ever reach them.  Don't settle.  I did that before and it works for awhile but it will never be everything you want and need.  If someone doesn't seem perfect, but has a good quality, give him a chance if you want and go out and do something fun together.  Intelligence in a guy trumps everything for me.  Along with an awesome sense of humor and wit.    If you were older, I'd say what my boyfriend jokingly tells me, "It's important to be in touch with your inner slut".  lol.

Do not lower yourself for anyone. But think why you're rejecting these guys. Is it because you genuinely don't find them attractive, because if it is then that's fine. But if it's because you don't think they're good enough for you why don't you give one of them a shot, you may be pleasantly surprised. But you don't need to turn into a sl*t. Maybe go out on a date, have a little fun, but keep hold of your morals.

vFaPZU0Maa	Well Scorpios can see into things very easily.. Like if u tried to kiss up to a Scorpio they would notice it and if u tried to play hard to get and they noticed, they would be like, NO, ITS OVER. Scorpios are serious and hate to be teased or hate when people try to play mind games with them.    Be real with a Scorpio. They value honesty, and are attracted to people with confidence and respect....and good reputations. Dont try to tell a Scorpio what to do or don't try to dominate them. Even if they hide they're negative feelings, your losing points with them. And never talk down on them...they have sensitive egos. But don't over compliment them or give them too much attention. Keep it normal.    Too many questions make them mad. Lol its annoying to Scorpios when u asked them personal questions, especially about the past. Trust is very important. If you don't have their trust, for get it.    And sex is on the Scorpio's mind often... If they love someone, they imagine intimacy with that person.. body contact, sex.. Lol so if you have their trust, and they love you... Enjoy the sex cause Scorpios are known for being the freakiest of the zodiac.    Scorpios also like to know everything about people, but don't like people doing it back to them. They like challenge.       ^^ i copied that off someone else's answer pretty much sums me up :)|`|O1IwHvMtaa	your superstitious.|`|SjD1aKT5aa	I'm Scorpio too,    Like some of the things the first girl said:    Opposite Sign - Taurus    Element - Water    Your One of Three Fixed Signs    Main Love Compatibility - Fellow Water Signs (Cancer, Pisces)    Could Be Compatible With - Virgo,Capricorn, Taurus    There just little things but there's so much to discover!    :] Kiki|`|EApHtKr6aa	The scorpio is magnetic, elusive, sexy and determined.Is an emotional being, and he takes it to the limits.

xPy6ZePkaa	They were on timers which made them trigger at the same time. He switched the timers because he knew Batman would go for Rachel and he needed Harvey alive to make his master plan fall into place and turning Gothams 'White Knight' bad. Which turned out well for him in the end.|`|2ogFk4Amaa	Different places, oh and he saved harvey because he was more important, that is why. He actualy choose to save harvey, because he could do alot for gotham.|`|v5uIviYvaa	No, they weren't in the same warehouse. When the Joker wired the rooms to explode, he must have wired them a certain way so that they would explode at the same time.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	No    The two were in two different locations, in two different warehouses.    The police went after Rachel as Batman went after Harvey, but both sides did not know who was in which warehouses. The Joker was testing them.    Edit:    It certainly does, but they just had to end that scene time with Rachel.|`|uctxzjIIaa	The two were on opposite ends of Gotham. Joker just set the timers to go off at the same time, and intentionally mixed up who was at each location when he told Batman.|`|rvVkwNBIaa	different locations all together i believe...unless someone wants to correct me|`|WTR5RrSzaa	Yes it was two different locations.    If you listen closely, you will notice that the Joker gives Batman two different addresses during the interrogation scene.    Therefore you know that it's different completely different locations rather than just two different rooms.

The problem with pop 'stars' is that they really aren't artist.  They usually just sing, they don't write the music, they don't write the lyrics, they don't play the instrument.  In other words they really aren't making music, they're just singing.  Unless you're very original a pop 'star' will always die out.|`|3FnhJluuaa	i think she is really talented.

His story broke my heart, but what's cool is that he's not letting his wife's death make him bitter.  And as much as I wanna see Danny do well, I'm also a huge fan of  Anoop Desai!  I fell in love with his voice during his initial audition when he sang, "Thank You," by Boyz II Men. He has an amazing voice, which is absolutely gorgeous! I also found out that he sang in an all male a cappella (sp?) group for the University of North Carolina and watched clips of the performances on You Tube. After watching those clips it made me want him to succeed even more. If he doesn't make it to the top 12 I'll throw a fit!|`|gp7qmHsMaa	My favorite on American Idol is Cody Sheldon.

8qa0j0Ebaa	I agree with you Newyorker. I'm with 50.     Officer Ricky is just a fraud. How many hits does he have under his belt? How about sales?    Officer Ricky doesn't even compare to fif. What I like about 50 Cent is that not only does he make great music, he is also very real in which that if something is on his mind, he'll speak about it. That includes addressing p*ssies who dare to disparage him.    50 Cent is someone you can respect because he knows how to get his paper, knows how to make music, has played the block, and lets the fans know what's going on with him. All-in-all, nowadays with a lot of rappers claiming they're gangsters, I see 50 as being the TRUE gangster out there in the game today.     And besides let's face it, Officer Ricky can talk all the crap he wants but he just doesn't compare.    Lets have a look:    - In a fight, it's pretty obvious that 50 would knock that fat out-of-shape muthaf*cker down.    - In terms of sales, Officer Ricky is talking about how 50 is dropping in sales? Well comparing the last two albums that 50 dropped (Curtis) and Ricky's Trilla; 50 Cent's Curtis has altogether pulled in 4.5 million copies sold, while Ricky's Trilla pulled in an overall measingly 501,566 copies sold.     - With that last point said, 50 Cent wins on a popularity contest and while Officer Ricky, he's just irrelevant to the public.    - Rick Ross is always talking about all the money has and how he is this "boss." Well if he's a boss, he certainly needs to step down and let 50 truly show him what it takes to be a boss. Forbes magazine had ranked 50 Cent as THE richest rapper for 2008. I believe they said that 50 was and most likely still is, worth more than 120 million dollars. 50 was ranked 1st on the list, beating Jay-Z, and P.Diddy who ranked in 2nd and 3rd respectively. And so where was Rick Ross? Oh, well he wasn't on the top 20 list of the world's richest rapppers.  Who's the boss now eh Officer Ricky? Maybe Rick Ross needs to stop calling himself boss and give that phrase exclusively to fif.    - And if were talking about street cred here, I think 50 wins this hands down (much like with everything else). But in this case, what could Rick Ross possibly say? I mean, Rick Ross was an OFFICER for crying out loud! That certainly takes all street credibility away. 50 Cent grew up tough, and it certainly shows it is embedded in his personality and mentality to this day from the rough experience he had growing up.    ________    Officer Ricky is gonna have to call for back up because 50 Cent is going to murder him. Also, there is a video out on the net that shows 50 taking the mother of Ross's daughter out shopping. Ouch! Don't mess with fif, that man is GANGSTER!|`|feb7143192e9c7ccb1a8b16f5fcd9677aa	rick ross|`|YAJvT2hlaa	an officer and a snitch, i would think they would be best friends. but they are both good rapers

bhRuQYIEaa	i think that most teen girls look at celebrities and see that you aren't worth jack if your not a size 2 and they put pressure on girls to have sex because the teen boys are seeing the sexy music videos and the "cool" rappers only sing about sex so i'd say that they have a big influence but there are exception to every rule|`|Ue5yKZ10aa	Miley cyrus her and her clothes now all little girls are dresses and acting like hannah! i heard a mom say her daughters wearing dresses that are way to short and belly shirts cause hannah is!!!    same with hsm. now every fricken little kid singing and acting like them! so annoying!
0QN7xDNeaa	If you were able to buy it then it's not sold out, your cousin was probably just looking on bad ticket sites, which there are a lot of. Trust me, I tried to buy tickets to a sold out concert on ticketmaster an it wouldn't let me, so if it let you buy them you should be good! :)|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	If you bought it online through Ticketmaster, you should be fine.  I have always bought my concert tickets that way and have never had a problem.    Maybe your cousin went to places that were sold out of their allotted tickets, or he was looking for more than one ticket?  Idk.

Who your favorite so far? Michael Castro. I also liked Rose Flack, but she went home. =(    Best performer?? not sure yet    best group performance? the first group    hottest guy/prettiest girl?? not sure...    favorite judge? I really like all of them    Favorite fight of last night?? the one with Tatiana    most annoying person?? Tatiana and Katrina (bikini girl)    the most conceited person?? bikini girl    who they should of never let through to hollywood?? bikini girl and Tatiana    your opinion on who you think might win the Competition?? not sure, it's too early to tell    who were you most sad to see leave ??? Rose Flack    who inspired you??? Rose    who surprised you??? the funny guy, Norman Gentle or whatever    who were you EXCITED to see leave yesterday, and cheered when they did????? bikini girl    best season so far???? probably season 7|`|19ZvkHqraa	wow! That's a lot of questions.  I would have to say my favorite so far is Danny (the one whose wife passed away) I'm happy bikini girl left too.  I am a little bummed out that one girl left.  (hippie blond one that was in the same group as bikini girl)|`|mYxvDgVxaa	My favorite so far has been Adam Lambert.  I'm glad bikini girl left she was so concided/fake.  Most inspirational-the blind guy  Favorite judge-Kara! I like how she starts drama. I like simon 2 because he sais it how it is.  My favorite fight was the one with the guy that was crying with the girl that was sitting on the chair that got yelled.  No, not best season so far.

OHC1CwlRaa	Shinedown - Second Chance?    The lyrics are:  My eyes are open wide  And by the way, I made it   Through the day  I watched the world outside  By the way, I'm leaving out   Today    Well, I just saw hailey's   Comet shooting  Said why you always running  In place?  Even the man in the   Moon disappears  Somewhere in the   Stratosphere    [Chorus]  Tell my mother,  Tell my father  I've done the best I can  To make them realise  This is my life  I hope they understand  I'm not angry, I'm just saying...  Sometimes goodbye   Is a second chance    Please don't cry  One tear for me  I'm not afraid of  What I have to say  This is my one and  Only voice  So listen close, it's  Only for today    Well, I just saw hailey's   Comet shooting  Said why you always running  In place?  Even the man in the   Moon disappears  Somewhere in the   Stratosphere    [Chorus]  Tell my mother,  Tell my father  I've done the best I can  To make them realise  This is my life  I hope they understand  I'm not angry, I'm just saying...  Sometimes goodbye   Is a second chance    Heres my chance  This is my chance    Tell my mother,  Tell my father  I've done the best I can  To make them realise  This is my life  I hope they understand  I'm not angry, I'm just saying...  Sometimes goodbye   Is a second chance    Sometimes goodbye   Is a second chance [x2]      It's a good song.

I love this show and I am SO watching it!!!  :)|`|ZFTkBTvvaa	its okay
blhIjLr8aa	Well my take on the whole situation is that he was one of the few olympic athletes who didn't turn to drugs/steroids and still achieved incredible goals. But then we see this picture and it is a huge disappointment. He apologizes but do we actually believe "it wont happen again." If he's careless enough to do it somewhere that isn't  private place then how do we know he didn't do this before? Besides he was already in trouble for DUI so he already has quite the record going.|`|eLFrlCmuaa	I think he deserves a second chance because it's not like pot can kill you I mean serriously it is better than you than ciggarettes.    While we are on this topic watch this video it is HILARIOUS!!!!  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnZb5wi_j...|`|3EyK4x2Naa	Who cares if he smokes some weed. Its not that serious, a lot of people do it. Don't just criticize him for it.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	He's a loser...    He may have broken a butt-load of records, but he's not a god.|`|1AFDw5KDaa	im not a fan and i dont think he should get another chance  my mom knows him and i dont like him.|`|8n3NvYQwaa	he now has a DUI conviction and a Bong issue...  what do you think we should do?  What would happen if you or I had done this and got caught?|`|AA11369490	yeah he does, its not like hes the only one in the world who smokes pot|`|2hV2fmZEaa	for the bong? sure. you dont do that when theres someone nearby with a camera. he learned his lesson.    i too have heard hes an asshole|`|S2aHg67yaa	I reckon everyone deserves another chance, but also that it was stupid to get caught.|`|eXGrrRLkaa	damn, it's just pot.  so many people smoke pot in the world..just because you don't notice it doesn't mean it isn't happening.  i think the person that took the picture was a dickkkk  thats what sucks about being a celebrity, of course all your flaws will be in the spotlight..  if hes a jerk than fck him|`|KucZ5Vlmaa	Dont know.|`|2wptPP8xaa	Big disapointment but he is human and he is a kid, now go after Barry Bonds again.|`|oP8krEBiaa	i honestly dont care. hes like 22 or 23, most teens are smoking weed or hav at least tried it once. its legal in many countries.so to sum it all up, i think the media is making such a big deal as always and i dont  really care.|`|eG53oROJaa	what else could explain 12,000 calories a day?|`|wdXl30HYaa	So many people smoke pot on a regular basis. Most people have at least tried it once in their lifetime. In that case, I don't think it should be as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. It's ridiculous. Yeah it's not the right thing to do, but cut the guy some slack.|`|ia3XD8KDaa	no he is a loser =(|`|NdTy3twjaa	Yea they found a photo with a bong in his mouth, it could of been something else in his mouth with that similar shape.  That would of been far worse for him and his career.  He'll get over this, I mean it's just weed.|`|lm2ByrhHaa	He sucks. He may be good in the water, but I say he's a jerk and is deffinetly full of himself. He gives us a bad name...|`|Z5eaybI0aa	When i first heard the story im like leave the guy alone, everybody smokes. But the story got big, on every news show and everybody is like give him a break, let him slide. Hate to have to say the truth but if he was an African American anything they would strip him of all of his endorsements and try and get back all of the medals even though he didn't fail a drug test during the olympics. So i say he gets what he deserves,|`|fFObxgxuaa	who gives 2 sh*ts if michael phelps smokes the ganja?!    seriously...it's not like it's performance enhancing!!|`|90cyv9f0aa	I don't like him...  especially after this...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQuotmKWA...|`|26e1b99c52b8488a8109c1f532ad3a59aa	Here's the thing;  They saw him with a bong in his mouth... IT COULD HAVE BEEN EMPTY FOR ALL THAT PICTURE SHOWS!    JEEBERS!      I love Michael Phelps. He's a beaaaaast.    x?o|`|uEczwc5vaa	same here. I thought he was a great guy, but now not so much|`|XPrsJBnvaa	He's an idiot that's for sure!  He knows that he's under a microscope now, so to do that was really dumb.  I don't know if he deserves a second chance, but even if he gets one, NOBODY is ever going to forget this screw-up...|`|fdP9UJOsaa	He knew what he was doing, its not like the weed just magically appeared in his mouth... but hey, ITS WEED... the guy can't help it lol.  The banning for 4yrs thing is kind of wrong though since 4yrs from now they'll be having the olympics in England. But I doubt he cares about all that, in the end he'll keep smoking is blunt.  His mom is a school Principal, can you imagine how she feels.|`|moFyK8s3aa	Yes I think so, so many people do pot it's not like he's any different.|`|ZRqSpl1Aaa	No, he doesn't. He already got busted for a DUI a few years back. He already had his second chance. The guy is an idiot.|`|yZAcwN3haa	yes ofcourse      but he wont stop hitting the pipe!      LEGALIZE IT!    Vote Normal!|`|Lnw6ZYMoaa	He's a human. He's going to mess up sometimes. It's wrong, but he deserves a second chance.|`|215646253ac5e0903ab28bc43e031fd3aa	I think he should be smart enough not to let anyone take his picture.    As for the pot itself, big deal. It did not make him a faster swimmer.    It is not steroids for heavens sake.

GwQoeHK4aa	Many women who have abortions feel relieved right away and will feel better in a few days.  Your friend is young and she will ultimately be glad that she made this decision.  However her future feelings are not important right now and telling her that everything will be okay or she did the right thing will probably not be especially helpful.      She's gone through a lot and you can help her just by being her friend.  Spend time with her doing the kinds of things you both enjoy and which you did before the abortion.  Go to movies or the mall or bake cookies.  Do something active like dancing or exercising which will help her mood in a super healthy way.  Sign up for a class together like pottery or new club.  Just be her friend.    Additionally, as her friend and confidant this will certainly have an effect on you as well.  Make sure while you are taking care of her that you take care of yourself.  If you find yourself getting stressed drink a cup of warm tea, do yoga, listen to music you find relaxing, or read a book.  You are brave to be their for your friend and she is lucky to know someone like you.|`|wT9KXIC0aa	Just try and convince her, that it was for the best,
4EflpUK8aa	I think it would be a difficult thing for a child to live with and understand, but it's not impossible, and I think it's far better than living a life where nobody wants to adopt them and they know it. I also think that in this day and age there wouldn't be nearly as much persecution from other children because there aren't as many narrow minded parents at home criticizing other people's life choices.     By the way, the exact same argument used to be made for bi-racial couples and look how common it is now. Kids used to get made fun of for having different race parents, people are just beginning to realize that everyone can make their own decisions. I hope the trend keeps up.|`|6c7e9e289fd5db36cd934c29dca6003eaa	NO.  He would be confused and embarrassed.  I have no problem with people loving who they want but to bring a child up in that kind of environment just isn't right.

p03Jc7eHaa	i hear ya man,got 2 yesterday myself|`|KAkiPY3kaa	You're chatting/ranting... its not an actual question.    But trolls like to report for no reason... happens to me all the time|`|hrsyPUwTaa	It's unavoidable... people on Y!A can't just stick to their own business if they have a problem with someone else... plus you have those people who feel like they're actually doing the Y!A community a service by abusing the Report Abuse button. It's sad.|`|mNC4r3EIaa	You're not the only one...|`|4XaL68C4aa	One word: trolls|`|HgRYP3cJaa	Appeal it.|`|gvnNy7Rtaa	I blame your mom.
AaXl5YYkaa	yes. make the paragraphs like little flaps that fold upwards and stic with velcro and then use chains to pull them down llike a light chain. :)|`|ff772a25081c886385c2eb6a501e148aaa	How about showing the old way of doing something before the invention, then the new way after the invention.
blhIjLr8aa	Yeah it bothers me.  There is this one kid in my class who everyone hates. He's constantly made fun of. So I wanted to be extra nice to him Cuz felt bad so I gave him a pack of gum and everyone goes "Oooo You like him"  It's just annoying. Haven't  they ever heard of A guy and a girl can just be friends?|`|gF4t4Lr4aa	Everybody sucks.    Just go in a room; alone..then the fun begins (;|`|TmHdtgZCaa	Yes!! And I hate it when they start the whole, 'You guys should soooo go out with each other!!'   Gah!! They should mind their own business.  :|  OR!! When your friends go up to some fugly kid and say, 'Will you go out with *your name here*?' Knowing that you would rather die than go out with them!!  Oh, yes. How I do hate that.|`|EiSUj2khaa	people who say that are probably actually jealous because  1. they like one of you themselves  2. they aren't in a relationship or are not liked back by the person they are into at the moment  3. they feel left out of your personal friendship and games  4. you and you're friend being stupid and playing around is annoying them.. which is usually the case. they probabbly think you're being stupid and immature and your game is annoying them... sometimes it can be this AND a combination of all of the above. Both parties can be annoying though|`|fSRqz7aYaa	People suck...    nuff said.|`|0dbDQh8Haa	omg yeah i hate that too!! it's sooo annoying! they are jealous cause they have no one to flirt with. cause then if you actually like your friend, it gets embarrassing!|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	I just wish people would mind their own business.|`|ITYcemuVaa	ugh i know i hate that i was hangin out with one of my guy friends at a dance and sooooo many people asked if we were going out! i don't get why people think girls and boys can be just friends!|`|xcf9jEsaaa	haha ik i hate it so much..  im like okay w/e you say..  then i guess i got on..but it kindof still bugs mee..ha (:|`|Bo837qXPaa	Yes! Arghh.   Like, my friend's boyfriend and I get along really well. We joke around all the time, and laugh at each other. She's always mad at me, and my other friends accuse me of flirting.   I'm sick of, 'You KNOW you like him, mal.'|`|UE9e10Avaa	yeah i hate it. especially when teachers do it...|`|q7Nm7Yk4aa	My friend Anthony. We met through his ex girlfriend, and my ex best friend (same girl) And she pressured me into being friends with him. I didn't really like him at first. But eventually I seen he was alright. So we've known each other for three years know. And he's my best friend! We are like totally nsync. And people always, and I mean always think we like each other, or are flirting. Which we aren't it's called being friendly. I don't understand why people can't handle others having fun together? It doesn't mean anything for two friends to enjoy each others company.     Either way I just ignore it, half the time I'm too wrapped up in having fun I don't sweat it. But if they're like saying quit flirting, I'm like mind your P's & Q's and get a life.|`|icgdb9DIaa	YES!!!! and i also hate it when they ask you if you go out.. just because your talking to them or whatever.. it drives me crazy!!|`|kAsfXZzVaa	yeah my friends do that 2 ppl and i'm just like "shut up!" to them they can be sooo annoying|`|UC2rLMONaa	Uh! My teacher does that all the time! She's always like you two, stop flirting! Meanwhile, I have a boyfriend that I've been with for two years, and the guy she says it to, likes me! I mean, if that doesn't make the situation awkward, I don't know what else... People need to mind their own business and shut their pie holes! Ha :)    I love Michael! Not Kyle, John, Tom, Kevin, or Aj! Ahh!|`|FW2WRGnjaa	Happens to me all the time with this certain guy.  It doesn't help that he's been telling people we've been dating for four years. No one believes him anyways, hah.  But, yeah, I'll just be talking to him, and he takes like, my pencil or something, and i kind of wrestle/attack/jump on him, and someone will be like 'Stop flirting!' or 'Are you two dating?'(|`|ZG0aVOa2aa	People are dumb so when you have fun with your friend, who cares what anyone else thinks. You should never care what anyone thinks of you! :)|`|4gDvfLsIaa	OhMiGosh yesh!    and hey, mi name is olivia too!  awesome.|`|UYbNRxcqaa	me, my bestfriend and the guy i like, sam went to the movies. afterwards, we went back to sams house, and his twin was there. my best friends ex is his twin! so it was like me and sam with  each other and jenna(best friend) and jake(sams twin) akwardly sitting with each other. then me and sam were like laughing and giggling and ****, obviously flirting, and jennas like stop it you two! get a room jeez! then sams older brother came down with his girlfriend, while me and sam were flirting, and shes like wow sam she likes you, and im like "no i dont!" and shes like mhm mhm. dont even lie girl. and i didnt say anything. that same day, when sam was walking me home, he said, "do you really like me?" and i said, whats it to you? and he said, oh well, if you did i would probably ask you out or something. and i said in that case..... and we kissed :] tomorrow will be our 4 month anniversary. :]|`|g4fRPhsMaa	ughh, so true!   Person: So are you two, like, uhm, going out or, like, something?  Him: Actually, we get it on every night.  Me: Wanna make our two into a three?    Lawl, that usually gets them XD|`|ZaSelz61aa	One advice: Always come in threes, at least one is a girl or boy.... so people won't be suspicious|`|MZWdvdEwaa	If you are "playing around" with the opposite sex, Then that IS flirting.  And flirting like that with every guy makes you look like a slut.

A4dKeISCaa	Starbucks usually only plays music from CDs that they sell (usually they're sitting in front of the biscotti by the register). I'd ask one of the baristas if the know what song you're describing.

18StUoKRaa	I cant exactly answer your original question but since no one else has answered I can try to clue you in some.    I  personally watch all of my anime at http://hiddenanime.com    They currently have up to bleach 205 on the site and they seem to release a new bleach weekly. (around tuesday).    They have a huge selection (nearly 5000 episodes) and they do not have any of the annoying ads that most of the other anime sites have.    Also, in the rare event that you find a broken video, they have a report feature and will have it fixed almost instantly. You even get an email thanking you for your help! lol    check it out [= you wont regret it.

AA10916001	Good day, Jessi.    Please do not call any number anyone gives you here. It will just be numbers of people that have pis*ed the poster off and they hope that their phone will be deluded with calls for Robert Pattinson.    I guarantee you that no one on here knows that information and if for some weird reason they did, he would have to trust them enough not to post it in a world-wide forum like YA.      Enjoy your day:)|`|k39bNUgeaa	hahahaha    You kids actually think you can get celebrities personal information    hahahaha    Also kid stalking is illegal    Have fun in jail    and you are a stalker because with his number you can find his house address|`|qslROmIMaa	SORRY but your never going to get it.   unless he gives it out (i doubt it)  but it is possible for him to get a fan line & give the number out- i doubt it but if he did, he would never answer it. ha.|`|RQVqVxcNaa	you cant get a personal number unless you know him but i do know hin so here its   its 1-800-get-a-life|`|eta0c25yaa	Really, you know someone can take legal action to sue the person who gives out celebrities numbers. You think its so fun calling celebrities but it's not fun givivng out their personal information like that.  Im sure they dont want strangers calling them.  Giving out someone's personal information can get you and the person who gave it out in BIG amounts of trouble.   Be careful in asking this kind of stuff.|`|sdupdUf4aa	407-get-a-life|`|81478e8ae808781e971c5ca14ac164b8aa	I don't think anyone on here would know that!

DUH!!!!!!!|`|AA11222724	Yeah i get what it is is its a joke that you have to be 16 or over to have sex, and because the girl in the back of the car is not quite 16, she knits to take up the time, he reads, then when she is 16 exactly to the minute they will have sex.|`|K8QRRp2Oaa	yup liens right =P

1lvyUwo7aa	you ok, truthfully you ain't nothin different. Look any one who makes a "Kiss Me Thru The Phone Remix" will never get respect from me or 95% of the Y!A community. If you want people to feel your songs go sell it to some little teenage girl. Look man, you aren't unique your like EVERYONE else, besides the occasional rapper who ACTUALLY is unique. I'm not hatin on you but I am calling you a hypocrite. You can't be unique if your rapping about the same thing that every other frickin rapper is. I know you do it as a hobby, but you just need to seriously step up your creativity, sentence structure, and use a actual beat that isn't that well known, get a bit deeper in your lyrics, show something that people don't know about.
L4f5ONEkaa	you cant get that music without buying sheet music  you can learn tabs but that is the easy way out  and when you click on songs some sites tell you  where to place your fingers    just learn sheet music(notes)  finger placing and you'll be fine    i play keyboard and synthesizer    good luck    you can learn by buying cheap music  books at your local instrument store  but it will have lame songs in it like  mary had a little lamb ect.  but it teaches you how to play with both  hands and the notes/keys|`|gZbGTXtbaa	Go To www.looknohands/chordhouse.com   That Should Refresh Your Memory On Your Chords

hxQr1TsUaa	Google the make and model of your DVD player to see if it has a region-free code that you can enter via the remote controller or the front panel to make your player accept all DVD's from around the world.  Many DVD players have them. If you can't find a code, you can probably pick up a really cheap dvd player somewhere that can be made region free.  If that doesn't work, there is some very fine windows software called dvdshrink that may help you out.

But it isn't long before Tracy's new world and attitude finally takes a toll on her, her family, and old friends.    Saved, juno, wristcutters, thumbsucker are also great teen movies.|`|avWMp518aa	i think the movie Loser (2000) is an excellent movie about teenagers. It captures a lot of the stuff that they do and is even pretty fun to watch. It stars Jason Biggs and Mena Suvari.

He also did not direct James & The Giant Peach or The Nightmare Before Christmas.      All three of those movies were directed by Henry Selick.      To answer your question, my favorite Burton film is Ed Wood.

If they say you suck buy the TV. Because you can't be horrible at watching TV unless you're a complete tard. But I've seen relatively smart people who just never realized that they suck somethin' fierce at playing the guitar/keeping rhythm so they just keep on playing away. You don't want to be one of those guys. It's a chick repellant.

I have been watching this literally since I was 6. It never gets old. I know almost every word too! The acting is fanastic. When you have a movie with Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert DeNiro, Robert Duvall, James Caan, and John Cazale, you're bound to have amazing acting! Also, every time I watch this movie, I always pick up something new that I never caught before. Those kind of movies are always fun! Also, I looove the music.    Lawrence of Arabia - I actually didn't want to watch this movie and once I did, I was glued to it! And then, I went out and bought it. It's soo amazing. The cinematography is outstanding! The music is amazing! It's so exciting and epic!     Slumdog Millionaire - I actually saw this movie last week and I'm going to see it again this week. It's amazing. Once again, the cinematography, the music, the acting, the directing, it's all around PERFECT. It's such a feel good movie! Everyone should see it!|`|WfNsiz6Taa	My favorite move is   The Green Mile       this movie has Tom Hanks Michael Clarke Duncan and several other wonderful actors the storyline of this movie is so wonderful even though the ending is sad this is the best movie i have ever seen besides the titanic of course|`|6e54b8b4daae77063c340153e92bedddaa	The Dark Knight  -great story and Joker's acting was fantastic!  [R.i.P HEATH LEDGER) .|`|hF9kpY8haa	my favorite movie is 21 the card game b/c it was a good movie and its about poker and i realy like poker|`|yqe0I5zpaa	No Country For Old Men, because the movie was adapted from one of my all-time favorite novels and it was made perfectly. The script and direction from the Coen brothers is just flawless. Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin and Tommy Lee Jones all give amazing performances. I love the edgy style the film gives off in it's dark and sardonic sense of humor. I love the action sequences when Llywellyn was being chased and he had to shoot the dog and also when Llywellyn and Chiguruh faced off and had a shootout. The ending is just ruthless and stunning. The cut to black ending, which is also the ending the novel had is just a great ending, i think it is one of the best ways to end a film or novel as bleak as No Country For Old Men. Chiguruh gets away with all the murders he has commited and also gets the money, it is just a realistic and disturbing truth about crime in our society. The fact that he gets away deeply chills you and that is what the cut to black ending is trying to give off, great film, great performances and a flawless ending. It is my favorite movie.

0eaf46168d011d74850b13f97e61e819aa	While Marc Warren and Jamie Murray were off filming other things, the guy who played Billy just wasn't asked back, as far as I know... I don't think he was that well received tbh.    Character wise, they said D&S are conning their way across America, which sort of set my shipper mind racing, thinking maybe they got together off screen.... anyway Mickey never knew Billy even existed, so he would have no reason to ask about him, and so we'll probably never know where he went.    I like the new 2 better than Billy, but I liked the original gang best of all. I really hope that if there's a new series, Marc and Jamie are free. Danny gives the series its best comic moments.

Hence;  When You see My Face  I hope it gives you hell   I hope it gives you hell  When You walk my way  Hope it gives you hell  Hope it gives you hell  And truth be told I miss you  And Truth be told I'm lyin'  WHEN YOU SEE MY FACE  HOPE IT GIVES YOU HELL!    Sorry, I got a little carried away. I haven't seen the music video. I love love love love that song.     x?o|`|SywsyzK6aa	yeah.  the guy's angry at his ex, (she prolly cheated on him, or dumped him  or something) and now he's getting back at her and he's like saying how he's this big rock star and she's not. and now she must feel like **** because he's famous and she's not. and this is his way of getting back at her, like rubbing it in her face.|`|3yYozfpjaa	This guy's probably angry at his ex for cheating on him or something. He smiles as if he's better off without her and hopes that she feels miserable when she sees him. Her life is probably crap and the guy's thinking that she deserves it for what she did to him. But i think he still has feelings for her because why else would he care about her being miserable?|`|GMgM54sCaa	well my thoughts are that its about a ex girlfriend whom didnt believe in his career in music, and he hopes she realizes what a idiot she is and it 'gives her hell' and that he wants to show her how he is way better off with out her.    i think it connects to the video somewhat, its just the neighbors fighting because they are total opposites.

7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	hmmm...it's close , but I guess the lowest point was 20 something years ago when the person I was living with almost killed me. First step to getting over it was getting out, then getting away, staying 'lost', and then just 1 day at a time, becoming part of the human race (very slowly!). I was well on my way a few years later, when I became pregnant with my daughter..I wasn't supposed to be able to have kids from one of his more violent attacks..but I did, and ultimately I think it was she who helped me on my way to truly overcoming it...probably didn't really happen until about 10-12 years later.|`|nO2vflnPaa	When my 7 1/2 month old baby brother died of S.I.D.S    I really never completey healed as he is my sibling.

I overcame it by tattooing a memorial of an angel baby on my arm with her name and date and looking at it everyday, knowing that she will ALWAYS be with me.|`|27OUtdOeaa	right now, but shall will pass!|`|GzpFvgVAaa	Last summer, I had just realized that I was 100% gay (after breaking up w/ my last bf, and i mean LAST). I had posted a picture of my girlfriend & I (on & off for 2 years, now official) kissing on myspace for a few days, then I took it off. My 'best friend' saw it & was furious (I didn't know for sure if i was gay or not, so i didn't tell her to that point). She called my ex (who was also furious for me being gay & breaking up w/ him) & told him about what she saw. He became even more enraged & decided to call my mom (he had her number from before) & tell her. the next day (when my girlfriend was conveniently at my house), she called me into her room & asked for my myspace password. I had to give it to her eventually, then she looked through the whole thing, then asked for my camera (which I hid). Then she closed the door & started scowling me about how being gay would make me have no friends, ever get a job, never get into college, I would have a terrible life, etc. After hours of crying, my girlfriend had to go home. After that, I wasn't allowed to see her. Then a month later, I was faced w/ the decision to not date her, live a very constricted life w/ many rules, or move out of my home, and that I did. It was a very difficult time for me. But After awhile, I came to find that being away from them made us fight less & be a little closer. Plus I am happy living w/ my girlfriend.

So, therefore they're not private, like woman's boobs are.
mNC4r3EIaa	The first answerer gave good advice. Loosen the strings first with the tuning pegs, and then straighten it the best you can.  As you tune though, make sure you keep adjusting the bridge so it'll stay straight.     However, if you mean the bridge is curved towards the fingerboard (there's a difference) then that's fine. It might look weird but it's not a problem.|`|36zm5zK8aa	yeah, pretty easily. but dont do it yourself if you dont know how. id ask your teacher or go to the place you got it. you just have to loosen the strings a bit and stand it back up|`|ff9kxHHqaa	yes ask your teacher or do it carefully yourself.i am positve.

UADLdXBtaa	I played drums all through high school and was first chair in my concert band. If you haven't played before, you need to start working out your hands. The muscles in your palm and thumb will ache terribly at first but if you get a set of sticks and just constantly tap on the carpet or something while you are watching tv it'll help a lot. Try doing some 16th notes until you can do them pretty fast with ease. I would also start lifting weights- just small ones- to strengthen your forearms. It'll also help you practice rhythm. Also, if you don't have a set yet, try to find some stuff that you can use to simulate the experience to practice doing multiple things at one time, like tapping your foot for the base while crossing your right hand to the cymbals and keeping pace with your left hand on a snare. The more you work your right foot will help keep it from getting tired as well. The muscles in your ankle will hurt for a while. I didn't have my own drum set at home so I would practice for concerts by doing this stuff.|`|A7J41yT0aa	yo quisiera tocar bateria lastima que no tenga ni para tomar clases de una.    por cierto gracias a tus preguntas estoy aprendiendo ingles

7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	"I Don't Care" by Apocalyptica featuring Adam Gontier (from Three Days Grace, so you were right)  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jjiRlIESe...|`|1jToUfoOaa	i think you might be talking about shake tramp by marianas trench|`|PTGI1uCuaa	the idea of the song sounds kinda like  salty eyes by the matches|`|hTJWBBXMaa	probably Apocalyptica they r the ones that use violins in their musik.|`|Zp5upGraaa	That sounds like that song "i write sins not tragedies", by panic at the disco, or a different song by them.
U5zcbHuZaa	I really like Etta James, but I don't know what her beef is with Beyonce. Did Beyonce sing the song really bad? Or did she sing it good and make Etta jealous? IDK, I imagine it would be hard to do a song better than Etta, but then again, Beyonce is pretty talented.|`|1e293be96bd70822011f3330fc2285c9aa	That was just sad for Etta James...    Etta did not write "at last" and wasn't the first or even third artist to sing the song, so she can't really say it was hers.    Plus Beyonce's rendition was amazing!!!    Plus for Etta James to go on and say bad things against Barack Obama is just bizarre|`|d2a20c0d2668e55c814a94412765a979aa	etta james is pathetic.  she needs to grow up.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	truthfully, I didn't even know Etta James was still alive before this whole beef started.  I thought the woman was dead 100 years ago along with the rest of them - Billy Holiday, Dinah Washington, etc...  But the entire BS is petty to me.|`|WyjRm10jaa	I don't like politic..  things like that..  there is a reason..|`|cdr7GQf3aa	Etta James is definately jealous because beyonce sung her song and the president isn't ask etta to sing it... beyonce sang it excelent but no one can sing it like etta =]

It does not matter what you look like.  If they do have feet that smell then try some green tea cream on them or a lavender spray.  These things will help the smell and make the feet smell better.

mzNLfY4Caa	Easy.     I would date someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with me and was really intelligent.    I feel like that is what my fiance is. But you know what? I do find him attractive. I just admire him so much...  Other girls might not consider him the hottest thing out there, but I do. =]|`|N5ncEyI0aa	im gonna go with clueless, because i can teach her and we can have more fun but the smart one will just correct everything i say and annoy me|`|qmG7q823aa	the 2nd 1. when i go out with some1 i dont go out with them 4 their looks but 4 their personality.|`|sV3vVYVVaa	sad to say i would choose number 1|`|VkyCQaeFaa	Call me shallow, but neither I'm afraid.|`|NccIJx5raa	Honestly... Well the one I have loads in common with.|`|0Yn6n8Qbaa	I'd choose  the  one with more common with me. For me I like people for who they are not what they look like or who they aren't.|`|Gwsf2V7uaa	Personality every time...|`|QY9vjyBlaa	The second one|`|DUYIi6p6aa	beautiful but absolutely clueless.  Its probably really shallow of me to say that. But if I'm going out with the guy who is beautiful & clueless, I'm guessing they at least have a good personality too.|`|kjWqxBPXaa	Sorry i am gonna have to go with the hot one !!! xxsamxx|`|tM1wHAfYaa	ummm i dunno  thats a bit of a toughie  imma have to say YEAH!|`|SUo3vEMwaa	second description|`|RmDFsL04aa	B, usually the more you find out about somebody, the more they have in common with you etc, makes them that bit more attractive anyway.    But i'd have to be in the situation myself tbh, but i'd say the second one.     :)|`|rAa8bfhwaa	Clueless means its easier to get in their pants so A|`|DZB0WCmmaa	mmmmmmmmmmmm, i don't go out that easy, i need to have seen the person, "beautiful but absolutely clueless", "wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent" are far too few traits to judge on, people are far more complex personalities.|`|0NkrNStxaa	neither|`|3F8bCZ55aa	Yes.|`|hMZQd7Cpaa	I would only date a person who i like.   Not who's not attractive.|`|jJwuMTSqaa	It could be both and the reason why is because if you have a natural spark with someone, in which you have a lot in common with, that person is beautiful to you...(if you have feelings, of course)|`|88uIjItaaa	C. Hott and Intelligent|`|2Zm03QGIaa	the second one =]|`|qPJPjrkNaa	2nd one|`|dDDAbqqhaa	I'd go out with both, just that it wouldn't last long|`|SbKkgwPQaa	the second.  this happened to me recently actually. i liked a gorgeous guy but then found out he was an airhead.. =/|`|dBuj1EOKaa	The second one, the first one would be death|`|ZhUmY8b3aa	damn dude theirs no middle lol  i guess number 2  i dont want an airhead.. even tho shes beautiful  but i think id have more fun with someone who has things in common with me|`|Qagl7o1Haa	B.    Because Looks Don't matter to me. It's the personality that counts.    =).|`|6Uohf1h1aa	b|`|dlSjuihjaa	The second one, of course!|`|eQVD090Xaa	not if we was`nt related|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Second one,looks fade but brains can only grow.|`|J0h1TKkxaa	the first one  you can always teach a person common sense|`|EpVNEzcSaa	doesn't quite matter.  i was told i should go out with a Neanderthal today, so i don't know.|`|jVZ7HbDsaa	The second one... there are SOME [but very, very few] exceptions to the attractiveness... I mean, I have no high standards or anything but some things DO need to be taken into account.|`|lgIuhKN4aa	I'd rather have someone i had something in common with.|`|NtCya5NYaa	the person i had more in common with.|`|P3g2Gz2Yaa	im soo shallow so A|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	I have gone for both lol, i am the 1st option so i would go w/both,|`|LRV65TbHaa	number two. cause I would find them attractive. Hence Im going out with them.|`|M5k4EZnMaa	someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent.      i cant judge people on looks    xxx|`|fR2Geezcaa	There has to be a basic attraction to them, but looks fade and personality remains.     Went out with the hottest guy I have ever seen and was bored out of mind! I loved going out on the town with him because every woman would just sit and stare but then I realized that all I was doing.     "Arm candy" isn't fun if he can't make you laugh!|`|hWm4DjrJaa	ahhh i'll say none because i tried the first one and when we talked and stuff all she told me is how hott i am ....OVER AND OVER and it got really boring.  I'd say neither the second because i need a cutie....maybe later in life 2 but not now  if there was a 3rd option it would be stay single until you find someone who has both looks and brain...  AND LACED UNDIES !!!!|`|SsV2dcxwaa	someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with me and was really intelligent, its what's on the inside that counts right???|`|Ju8PJZsraa	Eh, i have pretty high standards so neither :p i dont liek to just settle|`|5gqc5qyzaa	No and No. I wish I could say yes to the 2nd one but I can't :(|`|530fc5625af617fef3f442bfdc20f598aa	Personality every time...looks don't last anyway so what are you left with?|`|pQBjqMkoaa	2nd one|`|RtJ11zUZaa	B    I tried A once.  She was only sort of pretty once and was way beyond clueless... it was not good.|`|8IuO2kXWaa	the first 1|`|0Re4PPq9aa	I'M NOT PICKY JUST LOOK AT ME|`|LkOcJRRWaa	neither....nope.....neither|`|m5uzV6uqaa	second one.|`|K3FV1xZNaa	i should probobly say the ugly smart one...  but id rather have a clueless one who was hot! P: o.o|`|IkWRXHGXaa	someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent|`|NYZ8ebD6aa	go with the brains, you can give them looks later|`|06JnGkd9aa	the second one.|`|e20ea1a3352e7d0bf5b5005b71182ae4aa	i have done both and the second one always turned out better|`|S5BkvnbMaa	Yes.   the second one.  Looks aint everything, but sense of humor is.|`|sdupdUf4aa	NONE|`|qfUnwHyFaa	I would stay single till i found somebody who had both :)|`|mzhFrm5Taa	Depends what your lookin for, if it was just a one time hook up thing, the first one but for a relationship, the second one|`|FIALhwlKaa	I sure wouldnt go out with the beautyful one. Its nothing more annoying as someone is more stupid than I am :D|`|AA11892241	I would take both on a date...the best of both worlds, and see what happens.|`|913a3bd6e7df789bf21a927269464dfcaa	The latter !! you would be bored within the hour by the first option !!!|`|tvWm1e4naa	with someone i like.  he might be clueless but there might be something special about him. or unattractive but there might be something special about him.. i have to meet both of them to know.|`|RSv2E2KNaa	The second one.|`|uCD0cKttaa	somewhere in between|`|t5NjDHoTaa	I like an even mixture.    It's impossible for anything to last with anyone you find too clueless and you can't hold a discussion with them or someone you don't find attractive.    Everyone needs both things.  :-)|`|lFqUMMAGaa	Option two|`|Ta2lNKUVaa	Not necessarily attractive, but well dressed and well presented are necessary...cleanliness is next to Godliness - remember that one.    And as for intelligence, as long as they're not pretending to be more/less than they really are, and their IQ is above room temperature, it shouldn't be an issue either.    Shared interests are great, so long as they are healthy interests and won't cause you to get too competitive.    So long as you feel comfortable with them and can live with their flaws (we all have them), nothing else matters. Loving them can help too. It might take time though. Don't force it.|`|n7hezV5aaa	Honestly attractiveness is what we first see in a person. But we don't have relationships by just looking at each other. A relationship requires more than that. It requires speaking at some point. Imagine that! If the person I'm with doesn't stimulate my mind, then they become extremely unattractive to me. Nevertheless, I don't know what to say about the second category. I guess I'll just say maybe.|`|8ZdRD43yaa	Someone who wasn't attractive at all, but had loads in common with me and was really intelligent.    (:|`|5NitHFxKaa	Id go with either, but I'd have limits for the second one.|`|3AAHmvKFaa	Second one. I already am interested in someone just like that at the moment.|`|FrWhdRL1aa	Someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent.|`|A7ZbKKijaa	someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent.|`|EjfJaNn7aa	option 2 please|`|lSl2Arlpaa	no on the first one and the second one it depends if i was attracted to them or not :)|`|gF49d7Jcaa	someone who wasn't attractive at all but had loads in common with you and was really intelligent.  Just tell them to get plastic surgery :)|`|ozIc2s57aa	B.   looks dont matter... i need someone to be smart like me or i wont be able to talk to them!|`|IySzQ8KNaa	if u really like either of them then yes|`|BcrYBSJmaa	the first  if they were a nice, good person, even if they were stupid  and the second of course|`|NSjKEUpKaa	whats about someone who had both brains and beauty? thats my kinda guy..|`|x0pqUrrgaa	Beautiful hot girl and look count for me|`|KcnqfcGJaa	Is it wrong that I am not gay but I am turned by your gay emoness?     fu ck yeah and f uck emos|`|Epc3c1t4aa	the second ones me but i have never asked any one out hens the second one|`|t4FBtIsTaa	The good looking one obviously, ugly people offend me.|`|dS3c4KGBaa	the clever one cuz thn at least she no which way was up|`|VnVmWn5raa	i would definitely go out with someone that wasn't attractive and if we had lodes in common.    besides its not about looks more of personality.|`|orLZnrTqaa	if you put it that way you have no hope but if you go for a 50% brains and 50% looks you should be cool   hope i helped :)|`|AaymxGIUaa	personality above looks|`|3xRK3i4maa	either option sounds good to me, but I'm sure the second one would last longer.|`|I2fIfGUqaa	Hmm, tough one for most people but i would say neither. I would like to have seen the girl, she must at least looks beautiful and have some things in common and can laugh at herself at some points like me. Depends really on your perspective.|`|VzTuvdgwaa	id go out with someone inbetween.....my opinion

BUT it really does depend on my mood. Sometimes i haven't the patience to count out the change so i'll just have them break the bill, or credit it.     xoxo  ?|`|057SUuSYaa	I save my pennies for hucking at other cars on the freeway.

u0ljcg7jaa	No it's not. Sexually harassment is when it's sexual advances. Some women want to find an excuse for anything and use it as that.|`|vzWGml26aa	i think it was only to be nice. no sexual innuendos out of that squeeze.|`|PiDHN4TOaa	Unfortunately in today's litigious world companies have to protect themselves. Most have adopted a zero tolerance program in regards to sexual harassment. One of the things covered is unwanted or inappropriate touching. If your friend has no prior complaints against him, if the woman doesn't say she has asked him not to touch her blah blah blah. It comes down to 2 things, do the investigators believe your friend or are the executives castrated cowards preferring to fire than to take a chance at a law suit. Sucks, but that's the reality of the world. Men have to watch everything they say, everywhere they look, every movement they make. Good luck to him.|`|yAXrsQiFaa	nope|`|e1d6d765af7c1e2f2329bce5ce574c4baa	people are crazy......sounds to me like a nice person wishing someone a good day...|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	of course not! but , I have to tell you, most likely in this case, I'd get a good vibe from the person, appreciate the gesture and wishes..and it would be coo..On the other hand, if  I got a bad vibe (sometimes I get these feelings from people and it's strong and very spooky) and they did that ..I'd knock their hand away and tell them to back f off..However, I wouldn't pursue sexual harrassment charges, that's ridiculous..|`|AA11370204	No, that is not sexual harassment.|`|5jINw4PGaa	no|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Nope.|`|NQYnmxELaa	nope but I would have someone else start my car for me next time I need to use it.|`|NX4LYXkqaa	No must be a bit known to you  not for harassment!  Don't worry|`|w5KFkyGRaa	not that would not be sexual harassment. you need to lighten up a little. it would be something like touching your butt or something like that.|`|xESvfzQAaa	no...    Sexual Harassment is REPEATED offenses of a sexual nature that are clearly not appreciated.    Placing a hand on a shoulder isn't sexual harassment nor is complimenting someone on their looks.  Doing it more than a few times after the person is visibly disturbed by it would be.|`|nGNJFyGXaa	That would give me one free something, like following her into the ladies room|`|K2tWJE1Vaa	You didn't say if it was at the work place or not..I belive this is the work place..  What you are talking about...NO!!!!!    EEOC definition  In 1980 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission produced a set of guidelines for defining and enforcing Title VII (in 1984 it was expanded to include educational institutions). The EEOC defines sexual harassment as:    Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, or other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:    1. Submission to such conduct was made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of an individual's employment,    2. Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual was used as the basis for employment decisions affecting such individual, or    3. Such conduct has the purpose or effect of unreasonably interfering with an individual's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive working environment.    1. and 2. are called "quid pro quo" (Latin for "this for that" or "something for something"). They are essentially "sexual bribery", or promising of benefits, and "sexual coercion".    Type 3. known as "hostile work environment," is by far the most common form. This form is less clear cut and is more subjective.[13]    Note: a workplace harassment complainant must file with the EEOC and receive a "right to sue" clearance, before they can file a lawsuit against a company in federal court. (Boland, 2002)

My instructor insisted on driving even those who passed home because of the euphoria they may have had from passing.|`|o2pb32q5aa	because they are still learners and are in a car with an instructor, if you pass your test the instructor usually drives the car away.
zZ3Uxllfaa	they just go back to the way they looked in the first place , can't believe some people let their teeth get that bad but thats life as they say , i guess  they should start saving for the next lot when they need them|`|3F8bCZ55aa	That's a good question.My guess is it is like being given a second chance. You know what to do this time around so that you don't mess up.Of course if it does happen- oh well.|`|w6czQwhBaa	then they go back to how thay used to look..|`|lFqUMMAGaa	I can't imagine the TV company would cover the cost so they would be in trouble if they could not afford the treatment :-(|`|61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	She'll probably have to pay since those shows never last 10 years on air anyway.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	They definate pay for it to be done but not any further treatment unless it was done wrong or not quiet finished before show goes out.  They would also not be able to afford to use the dentist they did as he is a private one to the stars ect.  They would have to go to their own dentist back home and once done they would be able to replace like for like at a cost that is.|`|4e0bf4c2aa3815167814a54f67eaca29aa	I'm pretty sure it's a one time thing. any other work the people want after being on show the have to pay for themselves. Most folks who go on the reality shows usually try for a career in acting and feel the make-overs and exposure of already being on tv helps so I guess that's one way of footing the future bills.|`|Z6cHkBcFaa	Sorry I am 2 days late answering this question. I would think they would have to pay for any future work themselves.    I don't like this programme as I think it's unfair that they pay out all this money to people who have spent their life smoking, Drinking and Sun bathing. So it's their own fault. There are a lot of people who have aged due to illness or have had accidents who I think should be given a makeover to?

KolPO87Raa	I'm sorry for your loss, he must have been a special man to be mourned so.Your mom may not remember her dreams, many people do not remember their dreams. Also, your mother may not want to share them with you, either because she feels she must be strong for you, or, they may be dreams that she does not want to share( intimate dreams, or private moments, etc).    Sometimes we try to hard to have the kinds of dreams we want, and they don't happen. I have worked with people that have suffered a loss, and they didn't have any dreams of their departed significant other, and yet every one else in the family did.    Try sharing your dreams with her, and remember the happy moments together, in that way, your father will live forever. Good Luck.|`|aOinzEvYaa	Maybe your mom is taking drugs|`|4EflpUK8aa	My mom didn't have any dreams about my dad when he passed either. I don't know why.|`|T4CZbRsSaa	your mom probably has come to terms with your fathers passing...
6oASoFr7aa	Crash, its really good. Dis chick put it on one nite and I didn't think i was going to like it but it's twisted. It has Don Cheadle in it and Terrence Howard, and a bunch of other stars. Its a really good movie if you haven't seen it.|`|SvioIowdaa	Premonition. a really good film with sandra bullock in  or de -railed is a really good one :)  hope this helps|`|AN75ojgEaa	A really good movie a lot of people haven't seen is Running Scared.  Its a thriller with Paul Walker in it.|`|BYeEVLDQaa	JFK isn't at all boring. People who say so are just small minded kids or rednecks who have no appreciation for history. However, JFK isn't even remotely historically acurate.|`|KEZODxMlaa	dark knight, eagle eye,|`|DunU13FNaa	Try "Really bad things"  Its the kind of movie that you cringe at while watching, but you still watch it.  And its not really gross or anything.|`|tLI94qWNaa	My favorites are     Silence of the lambs   Slingblade   The chronicles of riddick   Pitch black   What dreams may come   Edward sissorhands   Seven   The pianist   The cube  Bug   Double Jepordy   Kiss the girls   Along came a spider|`|jwtRYXH0aa	recomended visit CAPITANCINEMA --*-- com and enjoy full movies online,new releases added everydays..just enter site in English And Join!!|`|SdTQVUaKaa	JFK is my top  1, though most people aren't familiar with it or they find it long and boring. It's very intriguing! Psychological thriller, go for American Psycho. Good lord that movie is intense!|`|nFakIvgoaa	I watched Eagle Eye last weekend and it was great.  I know it's been out a while so you may have already seen it, but if not, I highly recommend it.  Ditto for The Butterfly Effect.  I missed it when it first came out and just watched it a weeks ago, but really liked it.|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	You might try going on Flixter because they give you recommendations based on the movies you review.  If you haven't seen them, I recommend the Die Hard movies or pretty much anything with Bruce Willis. Twelve Monkey's is a good scifi/thriller that I really like.    I agree, Eagle Eye is great if you haven't seen it.  Plus Equilibrium, Gattaca, The Fifth Element....

I pretty much got everything I asked for/wanted. When I turned 16 I went and picked out a brand new car. When I graduated I was able to go the college of my choice. I was very lucky.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	No, but they gave a lot of love, and support and the occasional  justified wallop !|`|xuGwAlksaa	h3ll naw!!!!! they spoiled my lil bro tho...so bad you can smell him comin down the street :-)....but that's ok....made me the independent woman i am|`|23SwPCUgaa	yeah!

But not anymore I hate them now, I'm 17.|`|411e33cff378a28929963f21b85453abaa	Hell,no! My mom was a b*tch!   She was abusive,a drunkard, a drug addict,and spent money meant for me, on booze,drugs and making sure the rent/ electric / and water bills were paid, so she'd have a place to do her crap at.  It was only at christmas I got what I needed, which was from my gramma.  Gloves, undies and sox.  So,I decided when I had kids, ( i grew up never wanting them, but changed my mind when I got pregnant with my daughter,aged 20)   that they would be spoiled,and have all the things I never did.  I don't drink  I dont do drugs  I am not abusive, ( except spankings that they get when they realllly misbehave)   and i give them lots of lovies and attention, when they ask for it.  I am completly UNLIKE my mom.  My kids each have a Nintendo DS, games for them, and my middle kid has a computer.  They have plenty of clothes,and I give them what they like,within reason, for dinner.  And on their birthday, they can have all of the cake and ice cream they like, even for breakfast,lunch and dinner.  But that is ONLY on their birthdays.  ( usually, by dinner time, they want "real" food. Which is the game plan,anyways! lol)   When I go shopping, they get clothes,if I find something on clearance they like.  I treat them equally, but the baby, ( who is 6) is my favorite.  She my "peanut."   They each get the same number of gifts each b-day and x-mas.  They get the same number of gifts whenever I get them something.  To say my kids are spoiled, is not true. They are loved and treated the way children ought to be treated: with love and understanding.  They get the things children should have: A clean place to stay,good food, and a non-abusive environment.  My kids have what I didn't have.    makes my mom sooooooo mad,too! She says I spoilt them.  To which I just grin and say, "I learned from you,Mommy Dearest."|`|JNkz1XTaaa	Yes

Send me an email address (any).    However, I'm not sure if I can send 2 megabytes with Yahoo. You'll have to find out which email provider we have to use.    Edit: By the way... The song must have been recorded because on youtube you hear Fred typing when she starts to sing. My version is without the typing and the length is 2:03.    Therefore, the first answerer is wrong.|`|mP6ox5f3aa	Buy the music and get someone else to sing it.

To avoid more happening in the future:  Don't say hurtful things (even if someone has hurt you) don't agrue needlessly, turn the other cheek, never gossip.  Also you must smile and put out positive energy - help others and be always and ever supportive with your words actions and deeds.  What you put out is what is returned to you.  It's that simple.

UepGEiR9aa	6teen rules!!! jude is soo funny! seems CN is getting loose with the ratings and everything, but who cares? CN needs some cartoons for an older audience with toonami gone.|`|MfqHFQwbaa	I love that show! Sure, Cartoon Network is getting a little loose with the ratings and such(Think Total Drama Island. I mean, the guy had no pants on!), but the shows are still great! Its hard to find a cartoon nowadays that can actually talk about real life and make you laugh at the same time. =] The animations is also very unique in my opinion.    I also believe the show is perfect for a live action movie. But then again, people are getting crazy with cartoons being turned into real movies. I mean really, Dragonball Z? What are they thinking?!|`|erHajP0iaa	ohh i hate that show.  well i haven't watched it but my sisters watch it.  and that is so no G rated more like directed towards teens.  no joke.  it's too explicit for young girls.  i mean the on episode i saw them watching was about lesbians!  what is that?!|`|yC9TKKghaa	i love it it lets me watch a cartoon where spongebob isnt laughing and people aren't learning lessons its hilarious

He is alone...no crew...no manufactured dilemmas.  He just goes out and survives.  I am going to miss his show.|`|VzTuvdgwaa	Survivor man because he doesnt have a team following him he does his own surviving skills from the get go camera equiptment and all...bear is just showing not actual living out the survivor life.|`|LgKn8Dpdaa	Personally, I'm a fan of Survivorman. Les is left completely alone for a week, left to fend for himself without any crew. He must fend for himself while recording his own footage. You can tell he's acquired real survival skills from all of his journeys and has a knowledge of plants, animals, ect., that are common to certain areas. In my opinion, Survivorman presents more of a realistic situation.

YVmAKb8Eaa	Then get off the computer and get a job if you can't afford to eat...ugh.    Why would you even post a question telling everyone that you can't afford to eat? Are you looking for someone to send money to you or something?    Edit:  Really...Well, how does someone at work have the time to ask questions every 10 minutes? Kinda strange...hmm.|`|k0Ewe7mCaa	Because we can. Kyle is right, though.|`|4wHjtkJXaa	LOl i dunno. I think theyre being unusually nice actually.|`|5rESfAItaa	I agree.

You want P&S to be nice to you (which we're not nice to anyone), you have a bad work ethic, and you attacked some guy for saying you should get a job as if he was sitting next to you at work or something...|`|8ciQFDA3aa	because people on yahoo answers tend to be jerks.   i don't know why either.  the other day i asked a question, "who likes orange soda?"  and someone reported it saying it violated them.  some people take this a little too seriously!!!  p.s. don't worry if you can't afford to eat, eating out can be pricey, just try to spend a little more wisely.|`|rD3b5CETaa	stop taking it personally.  no one gives a f*ck about your personal life on here.|`|b65yrPX2aa	just today?

Make sure to put on a sweatshirt that is 5 times too big and arrange it so you look really sloppy. And I think you have to not take a shower for at least 4 weeks to fit in at Walmart, so if you're stinky, that will help too,.  It's also great to have at least 6 screaming children with you, and let them run wild around the store. You should pay no attention to them.     Tis the norm at Walmart.|`|AA11656632	I've never worn jammies to Wmt.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Go home an put on your polyester pants, your giant flannel shirt and flip flops.

1BbnyTfBaa	Trolling is a method of fishing.  You drag a heavy net along the bottom of the sea, or pull a fish hook behind the boat.    By comparison, trolling refers to traveling around looking for something, e.g. "Missy was trolling for a hook up."    On the Internet, trolling refers to making deliberately inflammatory remarks in order to provoke an argument.  The people who do this are called "trolls," and their actions are called "trolling."

ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I absolutely couldn't give a damn if people judge me.  Nobody is perfect and we all make mistakes along the way but nobody had the right to judge others if they have a problem with how I live my life, raise my kids or whatever then it is their problem not mine :-)|`|jF1xH89Caa	Nope! I just tune them out and ignore it.|`|43JgLpkKaa	i defend myself. everyone makes mistakes .. but you should not be continually reminded of them.|`|vea6mqPZaa	I don't care.    You see, Your right to offend me is more important than my right not to be offended.    The First Amendment gives you that right and the Second Amendment insures the government can not remove that right.|`|IkWRXHGXaa	Nope.    I am 29 years old and I have been mildly mentally handicapped all my life so after a few years of that you get use to it. And learn to let it go in one ear and out the other.

Most people that are that judgemental are throwing stones from glass houses, so I don't let it get to me too much.  I don't like judging people, so I'm not a fan of having it done to me either.|`|9dea1f49efb6500e25de9621eba871b4aa	I never waste one precious minute worrying what people think about  me. At least they're thinking about me. Nobody knows anything   about you except the people you love and trust with your innermost  self so they're not playing with the full deck available  to them. They  should spend their time improving themselves so they didn't have to  put someone else down to elevate their sorry asses. There's no need  to defend yourself when you're living the kind of life that brings you  happiness and joy. Just smile benevolently and allow them to kiss  your ring. lol..my mom once told me not to follow fashion, but to   let fashion follow you. Be a true original and you'll find people that  admire that quality. Stick with them and forget the sheep. Leave  them to go jumping off cliffs, following the others. Bah bah bah.|`|Xnmkdim0aa	depends the person.|`|foGvzgLJaa	Judging others doesnt define them, it defines yourself.....|`|LSNffo4jaa	Unfortunately, I care too much about what others think of me, so it does bother me a little, but not usually for very long.|`|rcNQvCeXaa	I really don't care how people see me or judge me, but i do care if my loved ones thought bad of me .If i had done everything that people who don't know me very well i would have lived a very wild life indeed, so if they find me interesting enough to bother about what i do or supposed to have done then there are leaving some one else alone.|`|zqOnNF2Gaa	I tell them to go to heii...:D|`|MciMh30Jaa	I shrug it off - I dont care what people think of me - I am who I am and I love it...

If they get too personal then I'll defend aggressively.     But if people just see me and think I'm weird or bizarre, then whatever.    Just don't bug me about the personal stuff, cause I when I get angry, i'm ANGRY! Like I'm not even the same person when I'm angry|`|AA11713693	Yes because they don't know me all that well.|`|NBXY35zPaa	Honestly, some peoples' opinion matters... your parents/family, best friends, spouse, your boss... You can't say if your family and close friends were to tell you that your drinking is ruining their lives that it wouldn't make you stop and take a look in the mirror. Technically, if you're a God believer, only God can judge you... but sometimes other people can help shape you into a better person.|`|GeyFdO5jaa	Yes i care  especially if its a lie       I defend  myself|`|xHc3KGDmaa	yes I do|`|NqxDBO2Xaa	no|`|OwdoUJuRaa	if they judge me and dont even no me then yes. I dont like to be judged in general though.|`|VEXKm1Obaa	I welcome judgement. It gives me the opportunity to throw it back in their face just how wrong they really are and that they are the ones to be deserved to be put on the "chopping block".
BhQSTvLsaa	I don't know.    See, I'm a virgin. Yet, I wear revealing tank tops and a ton of makeup. I've had people call me "$lut" and "wh0re" but I don't really care. Usually if someone is jealous of someone really pretty they call them a whore because whores have a lot of guys hit on them, love them, give them cash, ect.    I'm not saying that being a wh0re is a good thing. I'd never sell my body. But I think it's funny when people call me a wh0re because men love wh0res. Usually when you see wh0res in movies, they look like "pretty" girls.    I dunno if that makes sense. But if I am jealous of a girl (which I usually am not) I call them a wh0re.    On the other hand, like I said, I'm a virgin. (I kinda should be. I'm not even 18 yet.) I'm picky with guys. Derek Jeter was my first "love." I saw him in person when I was ten and I fell for him. I held onto him for all these years and never had a boyfriend. Now I'm in my teens and I like that model now. Hell, I don't even know if that model gives a shyt if I exist.    BUT, I am a BIT  promiscuous if I'm fantasizing about some guy. But I usually don't like to act permiscuous or get naked or whatever. But I'm still called a wh0re even though I'm a virgin and such.    Make sense?  I don't think so.    Whatever. I wanted to make clear that it doesn't matter if you're a virgin or a sex adict. Usually people will call you $lut or wh0re based on your style and how you act around people.|`|ce7ea7f83a5ba171eb4ef78c629b25a3aa	I admire women who wait til marriage it takes a lot of willpower and determination however I like to try before I buy so to speak lol....I have friends who sleep with a different guy every couple of weeks but it is their choice they are having safe sex they are not hurting anyone and I don't think of them as $luts or wh0res.  It gets back to the same old bull$hit that men can sleep with hundreds of women and be a stud but a woman is a wh0re.  No-one has the right to judge or label others cos nobody is perfect and we are not all the same and we don't all have the same views. Live and let live :-)|`|jF1xH89Caa	Yeah, it's sad that people have to use labels. Each and every person has their own views on the subject. All of this judging.....  :(  People need to mind their own business and not cast judgment upon others. Nobody is perfect.|`|zqOnNF2Gaa	I would rather be a wh0re than a slut..You make more money that way!|`|43JgLpkKaa	this can be true. some of my contacts know my views on this subject personally , others do not. i will just say this ... to each his / her own ... just do not force your view { or me my view } on others ... it is a sore subject to most.|`|MciMh30Jaa	Yes as the first answerer has clearly demonstrated lol she must have had 0.00partners lol JK =P    But your soo right chris ... when do you think about this stuff lol!!|`|R0mZqqfXaa	Some people are too judgemental.Each to their own.|`|7ee11f32ce402e558134b3f3e6323823aa	My opinion is don't judge. You never know what it's like until you've walked in someone else's shoes. You have no idea about their personality, past, character, demons, motivations,etc.    Of course I say 'you' generically Chris, I'm pretty sure you don't actually judge people.|`|AA11713693	With me I rather be prissy then to get STD or end up pregnant with an unwanted child.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	I'd rather be prissy than a sl*t|`|mwv79AIhaa	to each thier own, as long as thier happy.

It works for me.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	Which end? The moppy end, you might get more balls in, but they could be the wrong ones. The mop is too big and clumsy. I personally find pool easier if I just hit the ball I want in directly without having to use the cue ball, yet nobody seems to let me do it.|`|RKMWeMk9aa	LOL go for it ya never know.|`|UxSF3Doaaa	Sure, if you dip it in Mr. Clean first so you can be the one to clean the table getting the balls in the pockets instead of chalk.    Hmm, gave me an idea! I might use a pen for pool stick for my next pool game....|`|dqxW1W0eaa	No,cause you ain't gonna have very good english and aim with this method I am afraid|`|iEB1imSYaa	Anything's possible I guess. Just don't ruin the felt by getting PineSol on it OK? I've had nights myself when I figured I might as well be shooting with a broom handle. Sooooo frustrating!|`|Qih2hKqkaa	Do well.|`|gli7SbBoaa	If you can work a mop like a cue I see no problems with it.|`|clqgFUFFaa	sure, and while using it you can clean the floor so you shoot two birds with one bullet|`|uwtvDgxCaa	Depends on how good your game is!.....lol....|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	I don't see any reason why not. A friend of mine shoots on a league and they are all real good pool players. When he's having a bad time, he'll go in the back room n grab the broom and shoot with that. It is hysterical to watch. I've tried it and i can be done. It's all in good fun and it's even funnier when he wins a game.  :)|`|Wo2TEbHPaa	Now ur just making up excuses... ;]|`|AA10554783	Yes, you could mop up on them.
ULLDjjHZaa	no shoes no shirt no service    maybe they don't live by 1    idk|`|VnRECJJxaa	hey genius homeless people dont have money|`|wFN8bVqsaa	Because many of them are drug/alcohol addicts and spend any extra change on getting their next fix.|`|nmRZqyeoaa	Cause the food is free at the homeless shelter, and probably better.|`|0A3eadfYaa	1) Some are not homeless and are actually well off (yes, this is true).  Actually witnessed one getting into his Benz!  Pandering is actually big business.    2) Some/a lot prefer drugs/alcohol    3) What makes you think they don't?  They need to beg for the money right?    4) Tacos/burritos are cheaper.|`|YjTU7Psyaa	they dont have 1.08 thats why their homeless!!  thats not funny at all, its sad to see homeless people on the street!  and if they ONLY need 1.08 why dont YOU buy a bunch of burgers and hand them out to the homeless!|`|96ndKQncaa	They'd Rather Pay for their gambling habit (even though they always lose at it.)  And Some Meth.  McDonald's comes later. from the trashcan ;)    My answer was based on a phony hobo i used to see.  the man...didn't exactly have no money. he just didnt prioritise things and when he made money he would use it for his drugs and gambling fix then run out of money and beg again so he could pay for food.  LOL|`|cIE2xGBAaa	because if they dont have money for a home, they dont have the money to eat at McDonalds.|`|76834697406f46fddc8a871d4856248baa	Lack of money, the often apparent "look" of homeless people, the fact that homeless people are often smarter than you think because they KNOW the food is full of fat, and it's just one meal -- they can't go there for three squares a day.  I wouldn't recommend it either.|`|ESq2yEgCaa	They don't have enough money but if they get like enough street change then they probably  could wow you have a point!|`|FDt7cC8haa	so where does a homeless person get that 1.08? and what does his homeless family eat? And only one meal a day..? money isn't laying around the ground|`|OisJCjcTaa	Prob. Because they can't totally afford it.|`|5e6S1JqWaa	because they dont even have a $1.08!|`|VxKlbGtGaa	well they are usually homeless cause they don't have money.|`|V8sDPf2Eaa	even bums have taste|`|XspzL3LQaa	I've seen some Mcdonald's have the homeless ran off. Bu the ones that allow the homeless in have a high rate of homeless in the neighborhood! And yes I am homeless!|`|82bce41e90ec1a1ebe71a56d61363b42aa	How many homeless people can afford that.....?|`|AA12302661	McDonald's is addictive. I could not just buy a double cheeseburger.. I would need a lot more than just one.. I mean.. It's great..|`|RugUki9qaa	When I worked at Burger King lots of homeless people came in with their pennies and nickles. Maybe hobos prefer BK?|`|223ddd171a5a8fff50d94bbbc612c2a2aa	they would rather wait by the stop sign and sit there  wit a sign asking 4 money............|`|RtJ11zUZaa	You do have to be in a car to go through the drive-through... there are legal ramifications for allowing you to walk through it because it's not safe.    Why don't you ask a homeless person why they don't go to McDonalds... and how do you know they don't?|`|KwH9Jqpjaa	Some homeless people can't afford that much.   God Bless them all|`|uOgABhJpaa	i think thats a great idea  and often wondered that myself ,that being said i iagion some of them do eat a mcdonalds or any fast food place with a dollar menu|`|IZ1ZZHyCaa	LMFAO!!!! didnt mean 2 laugh bt wen i read da ? it was kinda of funie...bt ne ways yeah i think dey shud jux mak a homeless shelter 4 dem where ppl cook and other things like dat....2 help da homeless....|`|IcUsSPeUaa	Sometimes they don't have $1.08|`|7RjtALMZaa	that true|`|LSXdwRDUaa	I see alot of Homeless People eating in MacD, IN NYc  And they would sleep there too. WOW|`|TYQOafA8aa	Some times they are just too dirty and the manager wont accept them in.|`|gSwobfujaa	.......they do.|`|3Qxqh68xaa	there are tons of homeless people in the mcdonalds near my house when the free food supplies are not available|`|ytcixdv9aa	now how are they supposed to afford 1.08 AND booze...you got some learning to do missy...

EiB6GNxlaa	I love it too.. its a wicked good word..|`|c3MFIbeUaa	Miracles.  An event that appears inexplicable by the laws of nature and so is held to be supernatural in orign or an act of GOD.   It explains the wonders that never cease in this world.   From birth to death and the pleasures and rewards of the unexpected that thrill or excite someone.    It is the miracle of child birth for a couple who the doctors said would never have children. It is the first steps of the baby who has birth defects but continues to move forward in a way that shows all humans are special.   It is to that child  who brings his first all a's report card after failing so many times.   It is to that young girl that get's her first kiss from that boy she likes for so long.   It is the first rock concert for a young couple.   It is the last dance at a prom as a Senior in high school.   It is graduation from college.   It is the athletes first professional game.   It is the wedding night of a passionate couple.   It is the full moon that shines down on a couple in love at a romantic beach. It is the morning dew on a Meadow. It is the Nature of the natural world and it's ever changing environment but still having the freedom to live on.   It is the Oceans that create and destroy the land masses around but yet offers a quality that breathes are very existence.   It is the belief in good and evil. It is the hopes of angels and nightmares of demons.   It is the wickedness that you desire but under the safe constrains of love and respect, compassion and expierence with knowing their is so much to be learned in this world.   It is the cycle of life and it's conclussions that mankind needsto help others to survive. It is that miracle that brings us to the final equation and is answers.   The miracle of life is all about how you and I helped others and  in return will always be remembered by Family, friends and associates as caring people who offered that little bit of spark that keeps the hopes of this world alive.   Simply put, that spark is called LOVE.|`|NQYnmxELaa	i love fantastical, kind of sounds like fantastic and testicle lol|`|14f68b3ce9b74fe1effcb259219a38a9aa	Fantastic!!

gEkLQWF4aa	Pineapple Express is absolutely hilarious! Super Troopers never loses it's appeal, The Whole Nine Yards is great, Scary Movie the first and third are funny, second is okay..Superhero movie is funny too...Stepbrothers is great, Will Farrel movie, Anchorman never gets old, neither does Talladega Nights- Ballad of Ricky Bobby..What Happens in Vegas is hilarious and recent, House Bunny is funny as hell, and there are hot girls in it, Tropic Thunder is freakin awesome...If I had to put them in order of funniest to least, it would be  1. Super Troopers  2. Pineapple Express  3. Anchor Man  4. Talladega Nights  5. Tropic Thunder  6. Stepbrothers  7. The House Bunny  8. Scary Movie 1  9. Scary Movie 3  10. What Happens in Vegas  11. Whole Nine Yards  12. Superhero Movie|`|SdTQVUaKaa	There haven't been too many good comedies lately. For more recent go for Run Fat Boy Run. It had its moments. So did Pineapple Express.    If you like parodies go for Meet the Spartans.|`|AA10187097	The Godfather is my all-time favorite,but in the comedy genre I go with  O Brother,Where Art Thou?    The Godfather gets a ten,mostly because of the quality of the acting.  The writing is good,too,without which the actors wouldn't have had anything to work with. I give the second movie an eight-the acting isn't nearly as good,but the humor is hilarious.

If it was me in this situation though, due to the sheer fact of him being like a whole 1.5ft taller then me. I'd scream like a little ***** and run but before this, maybe drug him with some sort of drug that made him want to have it off with his sister or something, then steal all his posessions while screaming like a ***** and running.|`|iRKV3j6Gaa	well...if i had a weapon (i usually carry a pocket knife) then his nuts would no longer be his...seriously.  If not, he's 500 lbs, 7' tall, then he's pretty slow/fat, so you could easily out maneuver him...personnally, i'd get behind him and get a Marine-style choke-hold...10 seconds till unconscious...13 till death.|`|q76xm0YRaa	Ha ha. Thanks for the chuckle. What an image I have in my head now! I guess someone like that could be likened to Goliath.     I would be a goner because I'm only 5'1, so if I ran he would catch me easily just with his stride. At 500 lbs, I doubt if my punches could penetrate the flesh to hurt him. It would be similar to an attack by a T-Rex.     Thanks, now I will have nightmares for sure. Why is this question intended for just guys? Do you think a male's response would be more effective than a woman's. I doubt it, unless the guy was of a similar size.

BpZYMOsLaa	Yes and no.  The town area is safe and beautiful, and I wish I were there.    There are parts of the city where people got shot in the middle of the day.  There are tons of people who are just low lifes...  A lot of people are very lower class.  I don't look down on anyone, and I feel bad that so many people around here are stuggling.    I to have it rough.  But I I live in my own apartment that has heat, hot water.  I go to bed every night full.  Sure the people are awful, the city is awful.  I'm moving next year to a better place.

I do feel she is a great Governor, but I  don't feel personally proud about that.

Yu'l be famous one day!  xoxox|`|TTaLB4kdaa	I like!|`|10afe6f9a336d49e73eeb508bd3e9590aa	Ok i write lyrics too...and i really think some of this is really good!  i think the lines are too short you could expand some more...  i also like to use metaphors so its not so direct so that people who are close to me can read my lyrics but not know exactly what im talking about...i hope you understand what i mean?|`|AA10184575	it's pretty good! =]|`|BHggvsyQaa	wow i'm 12 too! that sounds like something i would write about me now. wanna be friends?(i'm not a creep btw i think those weirdos should stop)  i really like the song :-).
aAqxTw98aa	if youre 12, this is great. but lyrics arent supposed to be as straight forward as these are, you know. they have to not make sense a little. unless you want these songs to be sung by miley cyrus, or the jo bros actually. but if you do these are great. for deeper lyrics, check out coldplay.|`|jpzbDXEraa	Change the last verse, and it will be brilliant!    xxx|`|07bX5jGsaa	Well first of all, you shouldn't be writing lyrics like that if your 12, and why would you want to put a talentless band in your song.

6X9v2mciaa	I think regs are people who come on here often-- express themselves originally and stay for a while-- once you leave you're basically forgotten about.    Oldies: 2007 & back  Noobs: 2008 & on    From what ive read it seems like C&A now is basically a useless, repetitive survey & poll dump where not one person is creative and no questions can even compare to the C&A back then.     Why? i got no clue. I don't kno what the questions were like back then--- no one's given concrete examples (I wish they would i would like to compare the Q's now to back then so maybe i can even get ideas of what C&A was like) Users have just given general gists of how the old Q's were.     Really, I have no idea what you can ask on C&A besides polls & surveys if you wanna communicate & express yourself on here. and yes, people are unoriginal, people will always be unoriginal, but since C&A is a land of surveys, others wanna join in on the "fun" but how how many different manga & anime Q's can you ask? --especially if only a select few have an actual wide-variety of anime/manga, thats why survey/poll makers centralize it on the mainstream stuff. Also, it seems if you ask surveys or polls on here you become better remembered & mostly everyone want to leave an impression, especially if they can't communicate with others outside of the internet about anime because no one they now is interested in the subject.    -- im just about as confused as you are v____v"      p/s   Favorite Comics?    like manga? >:D FMA!!!!|`|AA10718475	What is the difference between the 'Old Regs' and the 'New Regs'?     IDK is there any?   Maybe the new ones are younger and not that serious and more on fun.        Also, what makes one generation is better than the other? I always see someone mention the old C&A is better than the current one. Can someone define 'better' for me?    I think that those who compare it are older than the ones here right now, he's could've got used tho the old community and left then returned with a sort of cultural shock, and misses the old C&A community.      Personally, I don't really care about the term regs because I always thought the term is pointless. :|    I use the term regs when I ask questions, cuz I prefer the answers of those are always in here and usually in my contacts, e.g. you and darth are the first ones I've talked with in here, they maybe pointless for you cuz you might think that the ones visiting here are all regs. If not what could be your reason cuz I did not read the other answers.      I'm just wondering if you people have any thoughts and opinions about the difference between this two 'generation'.    As you can see, I have none. :-D    p/s   Favorite Comics?    I like Beavis & Butthead but they're not available here in my country.   Archie Comics, I used to read them to before I started reading manga.    WOO HOOOOOOOOOOO I"M LEVEL 6!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Well, I always thought that 'regs' are just groupies or something. :/    I don't know. I'm the second generation of regs. Not sure of the first though.    Fav comics: Japanese    Edit:    Oh, I see.    Well, the older generation of C&A had more interesting questions, and they were a lot more funner.    Second generation, around my time to today, ask a bunch of surveys, and its the same type of questions being asked. Plus, most of the users here have become survey makers.|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hey ? ???? ?. :)    There is a lot of difference, it's just a newer generation of Comics and Answers members but still..., I think that anyone from 07' and back is considered a "Old Comics and Animation member" because when I use to come on back then alot of the questions and polls were way more creative and nobody rarely did surveys, which had more then five questions to answer. Now the "New Comics and Animation members" really stand out because of they'ree really repetitive polls and surveys and lack of informative answers for people, sometimes I receive answers to questions and I don't like the fact that it looks like there's no effort put into the answer.    Since I'm a grammar Nazi also, when I see questions shorter then four words or just a random answer that looks like you copy it directly from around here I automatically thumbs down it usually.     Anyway I think if people were more organized, asked better questions not all pertaining to a few anime that everyone on the planet knows about weather they like anime or not and were actually kind and didn't diss anyone for what they liked, even if it's hentai, or any other show it would be so much better. And don't even get me started on those Twilight fans posting here, I'vee been so kind to all of them saying "sorry, this is the wrong section etc". and still answering they're question and then they come back. Ugh, you can't win!     Oh, and I'm a sucker for the old Spider Man comics when I've read through all my manga.    Anyway see you later and have a good day.|`|kBek6QCLaa	I don't really have an opinion because I could care less    Old Regs> People from last year and beyond    New Regs> New people from ..this year    I don't think any generation could be ...judged..or ..*can't find the right word*    >>I don't read comics..|`|eQVS3x5Kaa	Hey AdDam! LOL, just about to sleep >.>'''    Well, the older regs came here first, as you can see now, our Qs are uncreative and too "cliche". When the C&A community started showing, we've had lots of ideas and subjects to talk about, it's something new so everyone would expect to be "excited" to the fullest. As for now, all the unique Q's are already asked 10 millions times, all the fresh and unique regs are gone too. C&A is kinda like "recycling" stuff. Bringing up the same Qs and ideas as before, but regs are always something new and unique, but i couldn't guarantee that we haven't seen the same personalities in the past! ;D    As for me, i'm new, defiantly      Favorite Comics?    >>Does manga count? o.O'''...lol XD          -have a nice day~! =D|`|btFSgJmlaa	Old regs are a lot smarter (such as yourself)    The new regs are more like Shark Feed.  They're getting the troll attention.       The old regs have a more diverse plate of shows.  Hell, I've watched a few soapy Anime before.  Didn't like them but still.    As for comics, I stopped caring about them.  Recently I heard Batman was killed, and Superman pulled a Goku but now the battle waits.    Raptor Jesus vs The God Damn Batman|`|TkPJYlaMaa	I don't understand the question|`|VLRkJOOuaa	Well the old regs are -- obviously -- those people who have been here (in C&A) for a very long time. To be specific, before C&A's long absence of people. There was a time where little to no questions were being asked.    The newer regs, probably, would have to be these people that are only starting to join now, or who just recently joined this C&A community.      Better is subjective, so there's really no point in defining that word. It's all an opinion, so if I were to define it, my answer would only be right in MY point of view.    Personally, I feel nostalgic towards the older days of C&A. Sure it might not have been filled with randomness, pointless surveys, and remarkably funny people, but it was authentic. And everyone actually watched more than one anime. People of the old C&A was actually smart (I mean anime-wise. I wouldn't know if they're smart in real life).      [[edit]]    Almost forgot. (:  Favorite comic series would have to be X-Men.      [[edit]]    Of course there were interesting questions! Many of the things asked in the old C&A was very original. But then again, it all comes down to what you think is interesting. I'm not sure if you think C&A might have been boring, bland, and too serious, but in my honest opinion, it wasn't. It's what got me interested in staying for the most part.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Some new regs ask too many surveys. Where they pack 5+ more questions in each question... Bel is one of those inbetween new and old regs, she is also one of the few that don't really ask Anime surveys.     Old regs around this time last year asked lesser surveys, and didn't care about the number of surveys they asked, plus there was more originality and we created the C&A empire ( ;    Chatango [Tri]  Animetology [Some old regs, FMC, Belle, etc]  Social Network (adding details in questions and editing answers) [Shadow Mist]  "Parties" [Shadow Mist]    [Edit]  Lol, well thats the reason it was sorta like a 'social network' because we posted questions that weren't really Anime related sometimes too =P   I guess it was challenging to be a TC back then, I remember when I lost mine lol, I could never get it back until I got suspended XD    Too much random is not really good for your health ( ;    Lol jk but I dont care|`|dYQUQGflaa	The old regs asked different questions pertaining only to anime/manga.  The new regs ask them too, but they also ask completely random questions.    I don't know much about the old regs, but I was around before I became a reg.  I didn't pay much attention because at that point C&A wasn't my section :)    fave comics?  I like manga the most.|`|l9uGrfSYaa	Hey there    ..........I'm not expecting you to read all of this. -_-    I understand where you are coming from at this point. I remember in High school when the Seniors considered themselves the rulers of the school while us pathetic frosh just kind of took it. When I look back at then and just before I graduated, I consider the group that graduated two to four years ahead of me to be the last good class the graduate from my high school. I haven't been wrong so far. The kids in there now are much more animal like and the teachers are even afraid to joke around anymore (it's a small school also, that scared the heck out of me that the teachers were seriously afraid of their own students).     I'm guessing C&A regs were similar. I unfortunately consider myself a newb even though I'm not up to date on such conversations that have passed the Q and A in Comics and Animation. I am viewed as some kid who doesn't know what to do but complain about life and blurt it out. Right? Don't worry, that's how I viewed the frosh last year. They were much worse and still are than my graduating class was.     Besides, this trend of ultra multi surveys seems to be the one thing taken away from the old regs. Sorry I made like two of them, Old Regs. I mean the old TC regs that worked hard to be in the position they were at.     As I stated before, I do watch old school anime, newer stuff, and anything worth watching. I seriously don't understand this hype about the newer stuff because it all looks identical.     Sorry if I have offended any regs on this hard explaination.     Favorite Comic: Hmm, I'm not really into the American stuff, but I'll just say anything by Dark Horse. Hellboy was actually pretty good (I think Dark Horse was behind that one). Constantine was good also. Ehh, too hard to decide.     Shockwave is right, us newbs are sharkbait for the trolls. I already had an old Q deleted today......so I'm thinking one of my contacts........-_-,  yah, my stuff is set on private too.     nya bya|`|APftKj7Saa	A lot of people have been asking this question lately - "what's the difference between new regs and old regs?"     It's like we're a new race or something :l    This could result in a third world war! Well not really but, umm yeah.    I get what everyone is saying about how the old regs were so much wiser and everyone asked informative question, and answering well -thought out answers. The new regs are like this new generation of anime fans who...well, still ask questions about anime, but no questions that relate specifically to a plot of a particular anime/manga.     I, personally, enjoy coming here and answering the polls/surveys. And yes, sometimes i do get tired of answering some of them, but since i don't have time to watch anime or to read manga because i have other things in life that are more imporrtant right now (like school -.-) the surveys are perfect because even non-anime watchers can answer them.    Sometimes, i do doubt myself for being so random and silly.  Whenever i answer a question such as this one, it causes me to ask myself if i should be more serious and stern, and ask questions that actually relate to "comics and animation"    I like being silly and random though, this is how i am in real life...and everyone always says be yourself, so i do. I don't people would like being serious in this section, it would suck actually.  Sorry for using such an immature term like "suck" XD    Anyway, im going to end my never-ending ranting and say goodnight because it's late here :l    ~! But not before i answer the question :D    p/s   Favorite Comics?    //\\/ Ichigo 100%    I don't even have time to read THAT anymore.    ~sigh~    Bye =)|`|VmXq5NCOaa	Old Regs:  Asked questions that only pertained to anime and manga, nothing else out of the ordinary. And...90% of them are gone from here and stuck on chatango or they just permanently left Y!A.     New Regs:  The generation of surveys and polls...and a lot of non C&A-related questions too. I somewhat quit answering a lot of questions here because I just don't feel to great answering all these questions that are constantly like "OMG what would you do if your favie charrie did this....?".....>>>see what I mean right?    There is a major difference between New and Old school.    In my perspective, the old C&A is "better" because the questions were actually creative and yet quite useful to an extent. (and by creative, I mean maturely creative...not teeny-bopper-type creativeness).  There were more questions that were battle/war scenes, tactics, questions that forced you to let out your imagination    I joined Comics & Animation back in Feb 2006 (account  1) when Y!A was still not yet even a year old. There were no surveys, no polls, no randomness, just cartoons and anime fans for the most part. The regulars were more of the serious-type and each question had its own valid purpose here. But everything is different now. When I returned to C&A not too long ago (part of late May, and then mid-December), I quickly noticed the obvious change that has taken place.     Well I only had one choice, conform to this new land...or leave....again.  And so I chose to stay and became an avid survey-maker. The surveys were fun at first but now some of them are just getting to me...and I'm tired of making those things currently. I mean, what more can I ask about anime?    Favorite Comics:  -The Parallax, the original Batman (both originating from the DC Universe).

PXfUyd5aaa	Let's see...all the good ones. Sometimes I think that the Academy just loathes action films, they're so old all that noise probably makes their heads hurt. They just want them to whisper constantly in movies like Atonement and The Reader. Hate that.    ...Sam...did you just say Twilight...?|`|Npi4QR7Maa	The Dark Night and Gran Torino and The Wrestler    The Reader was alright. Kate Winslet was great in it as always but it doesn't need A best picture nomination.    Neither did Revolutionary Road. I was highly disappointed by that movie|`|y8WBcehmaa	The reader was amazing. It was poignant and passionate, you obviously have no taste.    I would also like to add that I agree with the poster above me. The dark knight is very overrated because of Heath Ledger's untimely death. It was a good movie, but it was not the type of film that deserves best picture. It was not moving, didn't discuss important subject matter, didn't have extreme passion, traits that are generally found in best picture films.|`|KEZODxMlaa	dark knight is the one that got snubbed the most, it should have been nominated for picture,director,and best musical score|`|fU1WLz6Qaa	My brother would definitely agree on the Dark Knight. I think Wall-E should have gotten a best picture because I think it was awesome.   I don't think Benjamin Button was Best Picture material. Also I thought that the makeup in that movie was fake looking. I've seen better stuff on StarGate|`|cf64157ac10119178090cc78fd234a19aa	Twilight for best adapted screenplay- I have seen movies based on books that were loosely portrayed.  Twilight should get some credit for effort.    Any of the songs from Repo! The Genetic Opera for best original song.  The movie wasn't that great in my opinion, but the songs are fantastic. Chromaggia sung by Sarah Brightman should be Oscar material.|`|BYeEVLDQaa	Eastwood.    *The Dark Knight is NOT the type of film that would be considered for Best Picture. It was entertaining, sure, but movies based on Comic books are not going to be given those kinds of acalades. Honestly, I thought it was really overrated. It shouldn't be nominated for best picture just because Heath Ledger died, or just because it had cool special effects, or because it grossed over $500 million, or just because the media overhyped it all summer.    Not deep, sorry.|`|yWxWfspLaa	The Dark Knight defiantly deserved a lot more nominations, also Twilight, but that's probably just me...|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	The Wrestler was pretty craptacular in my opinion.   I agree with you about Dark Knight though.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	All I know is that Robert Downey Jr. should win the oscar for his role in Tropic Thunder. Heath Ledger won the golden globe, now its time for RDJ to win the oscar.|`|fpGroPpzaa	DARK KNIGHT!!!! This was by far the best movie of the year and even though it made the most money at the box office, and was highly praised by critics, it was completely dogged by the academy!

La teora que escuch es que hay un desfasaje de milisegundos entre un hemisferio y otro del cerebro, entre el que registra el presente y el que lo atesora como recuerdo, como si rebotara el impulso nervioso, entonces el hemisferio que acaba de recibir el suceso para almacenarlo, lo hace dos veces en un milisegundo y da el mensaje de "esto ya lo registr antes" (hace un milisegundo). Y el cerebro conciente lo interpreta como "ya lo viv antes".... no s si es cierto, pero suena con cierta lgica...|`|1eb55c7fc08d4e4f95b8704f85f5c0a3aa	Me dijeron que significa algo ya vivido.|`|c93a070ad2d58c39b9d0b9517b9507c1aa	Es cuando tienes la sensacion de que ya viviste algo que estas viviendo en ese momento.|`|768e1a120a8e594bb8ade7e3038b33e5aa	Creo que es una frase francesa diciendo esto me a pasado antes.|`|M1dT7om4aa	Simplemente significa ya vivido,no ya visto ni esa sensacion de que ya lo viste,significa ya vivido.|`|9adef085f28b988a79d2c3e3f23a6047aa	Es algo muy complejo...te lo planteo con un ejemplo:  Supongamos que sue?as que tu prima toca timbre en tu casa y tu la saludas desde una ventana, pero no lo recuerdas, no sabes que so?aste eso.  Luego viene tu prima toca timbre en tu casa y tu la saludas desde una ventana y sientes que eso ya te paso...como que eso ya lo habias vivido...|`|f29ef7ec8738befa552449f7d8438679aa	deja vu es la sensacion de k estas pasando por algo k ya viviste antes...|`|giC629GWaa	Es ese momento en el que te dices "esto parece que ya lo he vivido antes"  Un saludo|`|r3jFCagzaa	El significado como tal no lo se, pero un Dej Vu es cuando vives algo que sientes que ya habias visto o vivido...

Esto se debe a un fallo de la memoria que reconoce ese momento como ya vivido pero en realidad esto no paso.|`|LFtqa37Maa	El trmino dj vu (/de?a vy/, en francs ya visto) o paramnesia describe la experiencia de sentir que se ha sido testigo o se ha experimentado previamente una situacin nueva. Este trmino fue acu?ado por el investigador psquico francs mile Boirac (1851-1917) en su libro L'Avenir des sciences psychiques (El futuro de las ciencias psquicas), basado en un ensayo que escribi mientras estudiaba en la Universidad de Chicago. La experiencia del dj vu suele ir acompa?ada por una convincente sensacin de familiaridad y tambin por una sensacin de ?sobrecogimiento?, ?extra?eza? o ?rareza?. La experiencia ?previa? es con frecuencia atribuida a un sue?o, aunque en algunos casos se da una firme sensacin de que la experiencia ?ocurri autnticamente? en el pasado.    La experiencia de dj vu parece ser muy comn. En estudios formales, el 70% o ms de la poblacin afirma haberlo experimentado al menos una vez. Tambin se encuentran referencias a la experiencia de dj vu en literatura del pasado, lo que indica que no es un fenmeno nuevo. Ha sido extremadamente difcil invocar la experiencia del dj vu en el laboratorio, por lo que se han realizado pocos estudios empricos. Recientemente los investigadores han hallado formas de recrear esta sensacin usando hipnosis.    Esa es la versin corta, aqu tienes todo lo que desees saber sobre esa expresin: http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/D%C3%A9j%C3...|`|4B2vn8Mnaa	Es en francs y significa "ya visto".|`|Oq31sqa8aa	Es cuando vivis algo pero las imagenes que aparecen en esa vision te hacen pensar que ya viviste ese momento|`|ddcd88c6209d526b70e4563f861e5321aa	en fraces significa "ya visto".  y es un termino que se usa cuando tenemos la sensacion de que estamos viviendo algo que ya habiamos vivido.

c412a0ba42c4332ae22e5d9eee001110aa	i'm on her side too... i feel that while yes she is "famous" that doesn't mean she has to filter her life to meet the demands of the society we live in... i mean.. isnt that what every "innocent gone dirrrtty" girl did in the late 90s and early 2000s?? and where are they now? let her be her self with her friends.. dont make her grow up too fast    and.. if she were trying to offend anyone... i think she (again because she is famous) would be able to think of a few better ways to do that.... ALSO... i'm sorry but anyone who seriously thinks that things like that are an intentionally racist act are insane... i could say the same about any asian person who opens their eyes very large for a photo... in fact next time i see a photo of that i'll send it to OCA and ask them why they dont start focusing on the self esteem within their community to prevent the need to conform... after all, you have to love yourself before you can love (or accept) someone else    today's world needs to be so politically correct that every day freedoms are being taking away... yes, if you exercise your freedom but you are inhibiting upon someone elses rights, then you legally cant do that... but taking a picture while slanting your eyes?? GET OVER IT.. and what is "sorry" going to do? will it take the photos off the internet? or are you just trying to use this opportunity to propel your organization into the lime light before it slipps away?? (how many people heard of OCA before this issue?)      EDIT:  jerry b... you say she should not allow her friends to take videos and pictures of her doing something bad.. but they have a right too.... they are allowed to take photos of whatever they want... maybe you should have someone follow you around 24/7 with a camera and i'm sure they will catch you doing something that someone would have an issue with.. yea, you're not famous... but give it a rest... she will always have fans.. this, nor will anything shes done in the past, cause her fans to leave her.. maybe a few, but not enough to send this super rich teen running back to her old life|`|l1MpoNbwaa	I think people ARE making a big deal out of this.    Hell, I'm Asian(the kind she is making fun of) and I think it's more funny then anything.|`|ZqFzJ2L8aa	Just because she's young and popular doesn't make it right.     A lot of Asian kids look up to her as an entertainer. She let them down. She should appologize.    She's a stupid "country" hick who comes from a family of mullets lol.|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	It doesn't matter anymore whether it's right or not.  Miley Cyrus is effectively ruining her career with her stupid pictures.  Even if it is just a funny face, everyone is going to hate her for it because she's given people so many reasons to dislike her over the past year.|`|dgJ4LQG6aa	Wow. Thats pretty dumb. First off, that doesn't even look like her at ALL. Shes just being a teen (again).|`|kPbJze2Qaa	K, I'm not Asian but i'm still offended by this. Even though she's a teenager she's still a role model for lots of young people and in my opinion pulling that face was d-u-m-b.|`|keXaF4Puaa	Miley knows she's a celebrity. She should also know that everything she does is seen in the public. Today's world is overly sensitive to making faces to portray an ethnic group. I don't feel the least bit sorry for her. She should know better than to let her friends video tape or photograph her knowing anything can and will get out to the public. She's just another whiny little princess. She and her parents created her stardom and she needs to learn to live in the real world with the rest of us.|`|3ok7pKMNaa	I could rant about the OCA ALL DAY! This shouldn't be a scandal. I'm on her side as well. The OCA was REALLY overreacting. She wasn't trying to be racist in any way shape or form. I'm just gonna stop here so I don't say anything else stupid.|`|Rkg4CM9jaa	To all the people who judge ... YOU CAN'T JUDGE, UNLESS YOU ARE ASIAN AND KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE RACIALLY INSULTED.    If you have never experienced this kind of treatment, you have no idea.    I have, and I forgive her.|`|83f8a2ab6c6672a4366fb2aba94d6fdcaa	Your not over reactingf I completely agrree!  She was trying to make a funny face. If anyone who wasn't famous did that no one would care SERIOUSLY NO ONE WOULD CARE!!  They just do it because they are trying to break her just like they do to every other celebrity. People need to grow up.  Its a PERSONAL picture those are her buisness no one elses. If I made that face no one would care whatsoever. Because shes famous they have to try and break her which is messed up.
8HtC4j33aa	i would be ...  idk what i would be ...  its like i would be happy but it doesnt mean   im going to sleep with them. it would make me  more confident about myself i guess.|`|rcHnA1iQaa	upset cause I am taken|`|mvuHYNpjaa	maybe|`|nQHt2fknaa	i would honored and that would be awesome|`|sqNsOIzkaa	I wouldn't care personally.

Are you implying that a small number of people who weigh tons wish to sleep with me? Or that a large number of average-sized people want to?    Call me shallow but I'd answer differently depending on which it is.|`|lEq2Sllwaa	no you deff shouldnt be upset. and obviously your pretty hot so live it up|`|6PyMZAcnaa	Maybe a couple hundred pounds of people--but tons--no way.|`|9Emn2buTaa	Happy, but never do that in my life.  It's like a compliment in a weird way.|`|88d417c06b881633c7640f211bce43c9aa	well that would be bad you could get a std|`|bgdjtJepaa	Well hey, at least I'd know I'm hott.  I wouldn't be offended.  This is assuming I don't know the people--how would they yet like for for another reason when I've never met them?|`|hZ3rOobeaa	I would get ticked if they only wanted me for my looks. Though I wouldn't blame them I do have nice body.|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	Tons of people?  All at once?  I would be sore more than upset.    Ouch.|`|CJp2iKpcaa	I wouldn't be upset because that would let me know that i look damn good even though  I already know i am.

Let them eat cake...|`|VgE6HSdtaa	yeah, it would make me think people think im a whore|`|kzoUGdg0aa	I would be upset if they only wanted to sleep with me and not have a relationship with me. Right now, i'd rather have a relationship with no sex than have sex but no relationship.|`|A15bfvkBaa	I'd be happy! duh!  But they won't.. 'Cause i won't sleep with all of them =)|`|hi7uk4Kmaa	Pfft no.|`|SngOU70Baa	i have this issue, its tiresome|`|k8MIQSOvaa	I wouldn't be upset at all. But then again im no whore. I am perfectly fine with it being me and my boyfriend.|`|RtJ11zUZaa	I'm probably get worn out after a while.|`|VSsCZ2N6aa	It doesn't really matter with me.|`|RvddYKqjaa	I don't know people like that. I wouldn't be happy. I wouldn't be upset. I don't know anyone who likes me only for looks or clothing or anything like that. I'm far from pretty, so that could never happen anyway.|`|uUyCVpwXaa	No, i would be amused :)|`|FIALhwlKaa	Upset! Im not a ****.

qlEVlyidaa	The History of the Roman Catholic Church covers a period of just under two thousand years, making the Church one of the oldest continuously existing religious institutions in history. As one of the oldest branches of Christianity (the Eastern Orthodox and some other churches are also "apostolic" in origin -- i.e., they also date their origins back to the founding of the Christian Church at the time of the Apostles), the history of the Roman Catholic Church plays an integral part of the History of Christianity as a whole. In simple terms, the term "Catholic Church" as it is used in this article refers specifically to the Catholic Church founded in Rome, and presided over by their governing Bishop, commonly known as the Pope.    Over time, schisms have disrupted the unity of Christianity. The two largest of these involved the separation from the Catholic Church of Orthodox Christianity the (East-West Schism) and Protestantism (the Reformation) respectively. The Catholic Church has been the moving force in some of the major events of world history including the Evangelization of Europe and Latin America, the spreading of literacy and the foundation of the Universities, hospitals, monasticism, the development of Art, Music and Architecture, the Inquisition, the Crusades, an analytical philosophical method, and the downfall of Communism in Eastern Europe in the late 20th century.|`|6f86fae371d57267da187290ba1a58d7aa	yea see we come here 4 jokes and get this.

oqUci1MNaa	i wish i was canadian you hardly ever have to go to school, haha  i had three snow days this week  tbh i dont know if i want to go to school tomorrow, i have triple art, but i hate annoying people chucking snow balls at my head    worst thing was, one time it was really really windy. trees were falling down everywhere. a window smashed it was soo windy and about 5 trees fall over in the field (we have loadsa trees) and they didnt send us home, stupid teachers    another time we got a few days off school because there was an explosion in the industrial estate in my town (biggest explosion in peace time europe ;D) yeah and there was a huge fire and toxic dust cloud coverering most of the south east of england  see: http://www.pidcock.co.uk/photos/buncefie...|`|XuGFt3boaa	Yea, they were so fun, but I had to make them up.

Yeah you have to wear ugly uniform, but some days you have non uniform days, and you can wear whatever you want.  In my school you can wear makeup, and nail polish and coloured socks :S  Are you sure they arent letting you wear these things, cos normally they do.  Dont worry about it,, it can be kinda good. You will make loads of fun friends that you hang around with, and you can have a good time!  And normally the schools arent that strict, some of them have fun , laid back teachers, and in the school thre will be strict mean teachers, but you have those in every school.  Good luck, dont worry about it,  you'l have a great time :)    Lucy x|`|AA12317903	You are correct.|`|jWl7Zi1Uaa	Omg, that is strict!

You may behave in SOME lessons, but as soon as you get out? Hah.    I went to a very posh English Grammar school for girls and felt the same.    To be honest? These schools, the kids behave worse than in the others/     Strap yourself in for a rocky ride ;-)|`|UpvzJGAYaa	*oh snap*    well, why are you going to a british school anyway?    good luck dearr :]|`|cvjPQ9tTaa	My school is exactly the same probably worse. but you learn to live with it and it just becomes part of the routine.

I twas very strict and exactly how you describe.  But!!!!  I had the best time of my life!  You won't be the only one who wants to rebel!! There are always little ways to be naughty and the stricter the school is the more fun the rebellion is!  Plus you're American so you'll have instant cool factor as long as you're nice.  Watch Wild Child and you'll see that the British can be very lovely.  I miss my boarding school days. I was brought out at age 15 because my Dad moved back to England from Bermuda so I could live with him. But I still miss those days like mad.  And no matter how ugly or boring a uniform is, you can always make it your own!|`|LLmDQN7raa	Well aren't you just the most wonderful thing ever. You'll be all like "look at my, I'm practically the Queen. I'm so wonderful and amazing, even though I act like I hate it." Then you can go start a rebelious pop group called the "Paprika Girls" or something, and include alien-head Victoria Beckham if you want.    UK sucks, so does Canada.|`|6YZ74lEOaa	Hey you'll get over it trust me it's better than going to a public school and that's a fact!!! Plus it will be more sophisticated and you'll meet even cooler people because their British for crying out loud! Look I know how it feels to let go and move on trust me I have been there and done that. But someday you will look back on this, and once you have met new people and gotten used to everything then you will wonder why you were ever so upset!

956d43fbc612852be9834658deb4139faa	In January 2008 prosecutors charged Tim Chapman with first-degree "terroristic threatening" following an incident at the Ala Moana Center, Honolulu. He is also charged with indecent exposure. Police and prosecutors said security guards recognized Chapman from the reality television series Dog the Bounty Hunter when they responded to a report of a man in a vehicle fondling himself at a parking lot at at about 9 p.m. January 3, 2008.[3] Police said the guard instructed Chapman to put his clothes on and step out of the vehicle. He then jumped to the front and got in the drivers seat and turned toward the security officer, said Jim Fulton, spokesman for the city prosecutors office. He allegedly accelerated the truck and jumped the curb onto the sidewalk. The security guard had to jump out of the way, Fulton said.    Chapman's next court date for the terroristic threatening charges was set for January 24. On January 29, 2009, the threatening charges were dropped. [5] The indecent exposure charges still pending.    February 2, 2009, Tim Chapman was acquitted of indecent exposure.      He`ll probably be back on the show next season.    Yes Dog and Beth are still together.  I wish I knew how she lost weight.|`|kuBIjBkXaa	theyre still together and theyre still doing the show|`|d6wBfCvzaa	they better be.    I dont know them, of course but I honestly would be very hurt if they seperated.    I love them soooo much.|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	I don't think they got divorced, but Beth really needs to dress more appropriate for her age, and off course her weight.  She looks ridiculous.|`|bS6RPi9saa	no they r still together and i really don't know where is tim i know how did she lose weight|`|cQXjyQUqaa	Yeah I'm sure they are still together. I can't see them getting divorced.     I was wondering the same thing: how did she lose that weight. She looks really good now but I wish she would wear different shirts to hide those big *** boobies *LMAO*    As far as Tim goes..he has decided not to do the show for a little while. He still bounty hunts with them from time to time but he doesn't want to be on camera. It has to do with all that legal stuff they went through.

Most come with instructions.|`|k828yC3Kaa	Thats cool I wanted to learn how to play the harmonica too. I play guitar and I think it would be a nice combo. Go to your local music store and check out if there are some books on it. I know there are some out there because when my dad got me a harmonica for Christmas he said he saw one. I would check YouTube too, its surprisingly helpful sometimes when it comes to instruments. You'll probably get another better answer than mine, since I don't know how to play harmonica either and I want to learn. I just want to be able to refer back to this question.|`|WzKrZoHQaa	Just give it a good ******** - worked for my father everytime and he was on The Big Breakfast live playinmg Ravel's Balero - NO kidding I have the video as proof and he got a gold disk for winning the contest.

NY2fpmvPaa	We go out every weekend. But it's always with the same guy....what's up with that?    LOL|`|yGQgdYNwaa	It put my dating scene on a 5+ year hold, man, for real, and it's still on hold|`|ytcixdv9aa	Hell yes|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	I still date, more often then before I got married.  It's just that I date the same person every time.|`|n6oKAac1aa	Dramatically.  Not only has the frequency of dates decreased, but I always wind up going out with the same woman.  And, she never calls me the next morning.
U6XnPvO9aa	you did it Jimmy ;)|`|8b976b2f9d559004564384a0e185cc1caa	You click ask at the top...|`|llkSmgLJaa	Send Yahoo $5. Just kidding.|`|wZa3qiSbaa	Your asking now
ytcixdv9aa	naw, its pretty well stuffed|`|y6406A92aa	Yes, it was ..|`|Pg3voqXkaa	Nope thank goodness!|`|nXbTrRFOaa	No.|`|Oct9Pv9Jaa	Yes it was built in 1857.|`|7EzmV1t8aa	Sometimes I sure feel that way!  Very drafty old house!
oT2MEcZIaa	can you find a video from the event that includes the song?|`|AA10513301	I dont watch football so I couldnt answer that for you,sorry"
v7XIFyHFaa	Not I.  I think he's losing.  He has so much money he can do anything he wants and is getting bored.|`|AA10344050	on the contrary, i think he's retarded.    ever heard of mosquito bites? yeah..not so fun|`|9ndnvJW9aa	yes, he is
61ba79ff5c1542528d2b969d552d2fbeaa	Because she's a hot gold digger who brings some new fun drama to the show.  EDIT--for the record, Vicki isn't a "housewife" either, she's a workaholic who is a total control freak and treats people like crap.|`|UsNgFI7haa	she could have been married but she wanted to wait until jeff got better i like her she seems soooo fun|`|db479662109a13fa062d0f7c3ccf7629aa	Lynn doesn't live within the community either, btw.  She's on the show because she's eye candy (though if you see her without makeup or at a bad angle, she's got a manly face)|`|Fsr2Rofzaa	i dunno don't be a hater, she is the only one I like, well and Jeana.  Vicki is such a B!  That is why she is always getting hurt, it is KARMA, not accidents.  That is what happens when you treat others like they are beneath you, **** happens to ya!  Also Gretchen fiancee died this past Sept.  He wanted to marry her in the hospital but she said she wanted to wait until he was well.  I don't think she is as much as a gold digger as alot of you think|`|1TXJDiedaa	I know what you mean, the name of the show kind of speaks for itself. I have no idea except the fact that she is a non working bimbo who is after Jeff for his money. (Dont get me wrong I love the show and I like Gretchen) But I think they threw her in there because Tamra is SO jealous of her and she causes more drama being so cute.|`|vuCo9wZZaa	You are completely correct - I was just answering another question about this, and I the only reason that Gretchen (or Jo) were/are on that show is just to widen the age market and keep younger viewers.    I didn't mind when they had Lynne, and even Quinn (although her child wasn't even featured) but having young women on there just so they can prance around in a bikini defeats the concept of a housewife as they are not wives or mothers.     And you're right - I forgot about the whole gated community requirement...maybe even though I live in Chicago and since I am married I can apply and be on the show too! :)|`|bd023cea955952a6366f0a9965ea13caaa	Jo was never married either and she was on the show.  Personally, I love Gretchen. She just seems the most real besides Jeana. Gretchen seems like a really sweet and fun person and I cannot stand when people hate on her because she is young and pretty. All of the other ones(besides Jeana, of course. I love her too!) are just whiny, insecure, bitches!|`|ciXSjbCiaa	Lynn is by far my favorite. She is so nice.
HGdDjjULaa	she could have been. but kristen stewart does an amazing job!!!!!|`|wqeAeSVYaa	Who the hell is Bella Swan?  This better not be some character from that Twilight garbage.    I would say that Christina Ricci is interesting looking, but not classically beautiful|`|cXPVtTUJaa	She's really pretty but she's kinda old for the part of Bella and her voice doesn't match it. But I love her, she's a great actress. :)|`|FVDJMWDEaa	shes pretty...but no she couldnt be Bella. too old & not the right look.|`|APqlCz4naa	Yes Christina is very pretty. I think she probably could have been Bella Swan.|`|SVqR4Nebaa	Christina is sooo pretty.|`|c6411bc5aea6d9570644be09b6be3290aa	She is very pretty. But I don't think she could have been Bella Swan. It would be too weird.|`|bPXlYHlDaa	She is pretty even though she has a big forehead but either way Bella Swan is supposed to be a 17 year old HS girl and Christina Ricci does not look like she's in HS, so NO WAY.    PS. I AM A TWILIGHT FAN!! :)|`|KdCzS5Q4aa	She is definitely pretty, she looks like a little doll!  But she would look a bit too old to play Bella Swan (not being offensive), she is 31 I think.  No, I can't imagine her as Bella.
TxvIoWVGaa	In TMZ, US weekley, and Perez hilton that the directors are considering her for the part of Jane, the Volturri vampire leader, but since she is such a well-aclaimed and famous actor she will cost alot more, so they have to check their budget.   I hope she gets the part!    Hope this answers your question :-)|`|S2dM6AANaa	She's rumoured to be playing Jane but idk if its true yet.|`|cU2mZfdNaa	its a rumour and if its true she is gonna be jane    i wouldnt like her though. she doesnt look evil enough|`|mINKANlAaa	yes thats true, and its rumored that shes Jane.|`|cSceVisnaa	yeah its true
b1d94518579dc9e27a499adab10f47e4aa	Depends on who the one is and who the thousand are.  If you kill one humanitarian and save a thousand baby rapists, you probably didn't do a very good thing.  But if you kill one person who is putting others in danger and saving those thousand, then by all means.|`|Xnx7p7OHaa	If it's for the greater good.|`|NXrYtxFmaa	no i;d kill a 1000 for one fine chick though.|`|DOShS8q0aa	Well it shouldn't depend on the person. If at all you should not get yourself into such a position to begin with. I would sacrifice the one for he thousand though, even if it were good person for one evil person. Everyone has some evil traits so to judge based on that is to tell someone that they have a speck of dust in their eye when you yourself have a splinter. Hopefully you won't be put in that position
iKn0cSwTaa	She does NOT have one song with one of those names... like what the hell? Are you retarted? Shes fine, she isent selling her teen image, so shut up, and go with facts you acctualy know about, before being an idiot and making up song names to make her look bad. God, get a life! Do everyone a favour, and don't ask stupid questions like this, its ridiculous!|`|cesTfRKPaa	Thats fake.  Dont believe it.  She would have posted a blog about it.  And those names are way to dirty for her, even if she is trying to leave Disney.|`|Fyt9JxTqaa	Does anyone really care about that whore?|`|IPNnqs3Naa	I wouldn't be shocked if she did.  It's easy to see that see wants to break out of the innocent Disney image.|`|7XweQxIUaa	i don't really care, for god sakes, what is she like 15, she needs to tone down the skank image for a while|`|a860e9b17c0946e66c4ca331bb01f9d2aa	Who cares? Once a whore, always a whore.     I hope stupid parents don't buy this sad excuse for an album for their children. What are they teaching them?|`|FyCU0RPOaa	shut up, Blonde. miley's a wh*re and you know it.

It's magic!!
AA11618519	heat.        heat and cold oxygen makes white, if you get too hot, you will cry, if you put out a fire, you have to pee. Heat makes girls want to dress up, (like in the summer, how many girls look like slobs?) Too much heat can make celeretys go clubbing, or it can run their make-up down, but when heat reaches normal people, we get a fantastic tan. Heat turnes pancakes brown, it makes anything bubble, if u squeeze something too hot, it will pop, but if you look at it for too long, you will feel like youve popped.     ?|`|Yik6Psd6aa	the answer is "NO"|`|SlNMIFUaaa	nothing?|`|zVeLr7ZQaa	of course not!|`|4sa6gP17aa	Heat???

I've never been so disappointed!    Done - last night, actually. I went to pull the plug out of the sink after doing the washing up, and caught my finger on a knife that was still under the water. Rather that doing the sensible thing and taking the knife out, for some reason I decided it would be a better idea to use the other hand to pull out the plug and ended up with a bigger cut on the other side.|`|3hbCRIPQaa	Someone checking the petrol tank on a motorbike...........WITH A LIGHTER.|`|537b867276be6a2be9f4aceb55fa0c19aa	once i went into kfc and they said they werent serving chicken... hmmmm

I'm on the 3 DVD's for $17.99 a month, which is a good deal IMHO.     The thing about Blockbuster is that you can trade in the movies you get in the mail for a free rental at the store so you pretty much get any DVD you want. The better part is that the next one on your queue is sent in the mail so i can get a total of 6 movies out at a time; not bad.     The movies come in around 2-3 business day's which is kinda long, but I don't really have the time to sit and watch a whole movie everynight anyway, and i'm sure a lot of people don't too, so it works out.     I think they're still giving out free two week trials for Blockbuster, so everyone should try to get on it.|`|AA11106152	I use SugarDVD because they rent porn!    http://www.sugardvd.com/?refaff=14346|`|73ab3ea6a793ac059ee681c80ca5392caa	BLOCKBUSTER YOU GET MORE FOR SAME PRICE.  3 MOVIES AT ONE TIME FOR 17.99 ABD THE YOU TAKE THE MOVIE TO THE STORE AND GET 3 MORE MOVIES FREE AND THEY WILL SEND 3 MORE WHEN THEY GET YOUR IN THE MAIL.|`|zugg5L85aa	I use netflix it has more varitey of movies and theres more then  one copy of the movie than blockbuster.    block buster is tricky hiding charges and things like that  net flix is the safer choice

edcff3e798d82e6bee4eb34966967e4eaa	Hi girl yes i did see the movie dreamgirls and it was a great movie they should have at least been nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, but I'm so glad that Jennifer Hudson won. because she came along way from America ldol now to playing in movies. She deserve it all although some songs did drag on for quite a while. Other than that it was a very well played movie.they had some great singer in there to and some good actors like Jamie Foxx, Eddie Murphy, Beyonce Knowles, Jennifer Hudson it really was a good movie it almost made me cry when i had first saw it but you should have waited girl because the dvd is coming out on May 1, 2007.|`|AA11150101	I saw it and I loved it.

YUQgHg9Xaa	Exactamente, pues el q tenga ms tiempo al aire no significa q sea ms exitosa =s, de hecho, comparto la opinin anterior, creo q se han vuelto repetitivos. Me gustan los simpson, pero considero que ya es demasiado. En cambio, Dragon Ball si es buensima caricatura, y pues la verdad me gustara ver nuevos capitulos. Fue muy triste su fin, pero de eso a q enfade con tanto tiempo...|`|RCKFramUaa	Te recomiendo:    http://www.lossimpsonsonline.com.ar/      Esta muy buena y es muy completa.  Salu2|`|kLy2Z6qraa	los simpeson sin duda, lo ponen en todos sitios|`|rpyrdC3uaa	dragon ball porque es una caricatura japonesa|`|AA11481777	el maldito escoby-doo aunque es el peor y mas monotono programa en el mundo para mi lo conocen en todos los paises.|`|e8784519bc875655a55756ce904ead80aa	Dragon Ball Z. Sobre todo porque, diez a?os despues de haber terminado, sigue levantando pasiones. Y lo ms importante: Toriyama supo terminarla a tiempo, mientras que los Simpsons no hacen ms que repetirse con una frmula gastadsima. Los nuevos episodios no hacen gracia. Hay que saber cuando parar una serie, que as deja buen sabor de boca. Mira lo que pas con Dragon Ball GT, que era malsima.    Puede que los Simpsons sigan en activo, pero ?a qu coste, si ya no tienen gracia?|`|xYGMNStTaa	Los Simpsons son muy buenos y divertidos, aunque dragon ball tambien es muy bueno y tiene mucha audiencia pero para mi los mejores son los simpsons|`|Uk7boYCraa	los simpsons por que a mucha gente no le gusta dragon ball por lo menos la ke yo conozco...nose  saludos|`|fc7918d778083c8119972ba3a1642a78aa	Los Simpson sin duda!!!!!!!!!!!|`|3PsGnmbgaa	los Simpsons,pero se han vuelto pornograficos satanicos y violentos.  pero si te fijas bien dragon ball esta tomando moda por lo capitulos de AF    si quieren saber sobre dagon ball AF es cribanme a davidomz@yahoo.es|`|CuyVMjiVaa	yo creo k los dos tiene la misma cantidad d fans!!!  pero teniendo en cuenta k los simpsons son mas actuales y son comicos creo k los simpsons|`|8f5235b029f851fdd2cb15662913234caa	Cada una de ambas series han sido las mejores en su genero, no debemos olvidar que Dragon Ball hace parte de un estilo de Hentai, mientras los Simpsons son dibujos animados Norte Americanos, sin embargo, si los compararmos debera decir que aunque me encanta Dragon Ball y de hecho compre todas las series y las peliculas, los Simpsons son una serie que se ha mantenido por ms tiempo, es decir, comenz antes que Dragon Ball y an sigue, mientras ya en la ultima pelicula de Dragon Ball pudimos ver su final.|`|QRyYrEVcaa	Pues yo creo k son los simpsons spero haberte ayudado besos|`|887cd7b8fa3361fae590280f2a8cfc0caa	The Simpsons|`|e3c99577536b3aefcb49d31ef9e712a5aa	POR SUPUESTO QUE LOS SIMPSONS POR ESO LLEVA TANTAS TEMPORADAS AL AIRE Y DRAGON BALL FUE MUY BUENO PERO NO LLEVA LA CANTIDAD DE TIMPO QU LO SIMPSONS|`|1NmR7l9Baa	Sin duda los Simpsons
Ajbfaefxaa	Sisi y perdieron mucho de su encanto...y esto se debe a q ya no lo maneja mas Matt Groening sino q lo maneja la FOX y ellos lo unico que quieren es seguir sacando plata renovando sus capitulos asi la gente los ve....pero obviamente q ese hhumor y esas flashadas que solo las podia poner su autor ahora no aparecen y es muy "yanqui" ahora, con chistes tontos. A esto se le suma la tracuccion latinas de las voces q son malisimas a mi gusto. Obviamente q los simpson siguen siendo los simpson y ellos mantendran su esencia eternamente.  "Mas que fanticos, Somos fieles!!."|`|VE7L8dhzaa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo!!, aunque los primeros captulos ya los hayamos visto infinitas veces y nos los sepamos casi de memoria, considero que son los mejores y son los que dan la escencia de  La Familia Simpson.    Los de las ltimas temporadas son aburridos y perdieron el encanto.|`|8839cbee7126680e2ba354b0c1d29acaaa	Es que despues de 18 temporadas a cualquiera se le agotan las ideas.|`|6kdxNmIDaa	claro que no, siguen igual que siempre, tal vez los capitulos no son como antes pero es que se acaban las ideas despues de 18 temporadas|`|J1N8Y6oTaa	Pff, yo a partir de la 15 ya lo empece a ver menos. Antes me estaba retorciendo de risa todo el capitulo, aunq lo hubiera visto ya mil veces... Aora solo es una sonrisita de vez en cuando... Incluso Padre de Familia, q no me parece una serie tan wena, me hace reir mas (Stewe es dios).  Seria mjor q la dejaran antes de ir a peor, y se centraran en futurama, xq creo q es cojonuda pero da la impresion de q la tienen un poco de lado...|`|FIaTR5FJaa	NO--..    lo  que  ocurre  es  que YA CRECISTE...  y  ya  no  te hacen  la misma GRACIA que antes    cuando  UNO crece,  los intereses  CAMBIAN  la serie  no ha cambiado,  los que cambiamos  fuimos  nosotros|`|aKozQDlJaa	no,lo que pasa es k ya nos aburrimos de ellas|`|c19d65bac9390b43fa5e2aa4f8174e07aa	1.- Homero hace cosas muy estupidas y sin gracia  2.- el doblaje es de tercera???  3.-se les terminaron las ideas???|`|vKAbMySMaa	estoy deacuerdo los simpson fueron entraron en un declive y les sera dificil a los  productores y guinistas el salir de  ese oyo, pero lo peor es que las voces no tienen nada que ver con los personajes, pero por el vien del show espero que mejore y que vuelva a tener la calidad de antes.|`|fXOBtcSPaa	TODOS USTEDES ESTAN LOCOS, LOS SIMPSONS SON LOS MEJORES!!!! OJALA Q NUNCA TERMINE|`|4GM5rZ57aa	no, esque talvez ya te aburriste de ver tanto los simpson.. para mi siguen siendo lo maximo.. y si a ti no pues ya no la veas.. que aguafiesta es la gente que se queda viendo la tele todo el dia|`|6f80b1ff033376cf9176f37e1754d1b0aa	El doblaje es cada vez ms descuidado y muchas de las bromas que solo son entendibles en ingls, en espa?ol no tienen sentido. A so se suman los cambios en las voces, desde Lisa hasta el se?or Burns, lo que nos provoca una sensacin de..suplantacin.  Y Marge se ha vuelto vada vez ms desagradable que dan ganas de matarla.|`|phFS7fkPaa	Cierto, esta temporada 18 que ya esta por acabar, yo dira que ha sido la peor de todas.|`|AA11481777	en parte, pero creo que el problema tambien es de los que hacen el doblaje, de todos modos tienes razon, lo mismo pasa con south park, pero aunque no me lo veo dicen que family guy (creo que se llama padre de familia en espa?ol) cada vez es mejor.|`|uKeuDYnzaa	si ,tenes toda la razon.  esperemos q x lo menos la pelicula sea como las viejas temporadas xq sino va a ser una mierd@   chaus|`|a395a29f1140f28680d45c54741e8a47aa	Pues los capitulos que yo he visto de las ultimas temporadas me han gustado, hoy se estrena la nueva en temporada en Fox espero que sea buena.  Saludos...!|`|k4CeqvOoaa	Estoy completamente de acuerdo contigo, por fin encuentro alguien que dice la verdad, las ultimas temporadas tienen varias fallas: les cambiaron las voces a los personajes y ahoran se oyen mas estupidos y menos reales, las situaciones se vuelven grises y repetitivas o llegan a variar tanto que rayan con la ridiculez (como cuando se hacia pornografia en casa de Flanders), ademas parece que los libretistas perdieron medio cerebro, ya no hay buenos parlamentos|`|ML5sPVYhaa	osea, van en la 18, yo creo que se les estan acabando las ideas, ademas lo que no me gusta es que le cambiaron las voz al homero y a lisa- salu2

O sea, no se apresuren a ennoviarse si no estn seguros de un sentimiento puro y lindo como es el amor... mientras tanto, disfruten sanamente la vida!

Solo aclarenlo porque si no su amistad puede terminar.|`|306536dff89147d4226be2bdd21826f0aa	Sabes... salir de una relacin no es fcil, dejas mucho en ella y cuando entras en otra relacin amorosa es natural que te sientas desorientado, lo que te aconseja la mayora de quienes contestaron es cierto: DALE TIEMPO  y DATELO TU.|`|1pODdFL6aa	Definitivamente es porque no sabe lo que quiere...

Adam said he didn't have anyone to talk to.    God said he was going to give him a companion and it would be a woman.    God said, "This person will cook for you and wash your clothes, she will always agree with every decision you make. She will bear you children and never ask you to get up in the middle of the night to take care of them.    She will not nag you, and will always be the first to admit she was wrong when you've had a disagreement. She will never have a headache, and will freely give you love and compassion whenever needed."    Adam asked God, "What will a woman like that cost?"    God said, "An arm and a leg."    Adam said, "What can I get for just a rib?"    The rest is history.  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    Two Nuts:     Two boy scouts went on a nature hike in the hills, picking hickory nuts along the way. They soon filled their small pails and started to fill their pants and shirt pockets. When they could hold no more nuts they started down the country road until they came across a cemetery. One of the boys decided that would be a good place to stop and divide up the nuts.     The two boys sat in the shade of a large oak tree and unloaded their pockets and buckets dumping all of the nuts in a large pile. In the process two of the nuts rolled down near the road. The boys then proceeded to divide up the nuts. "One for you. One for me. One for you. One for me."     As they were dividing the nuts, another boy walking by the cemetery happened to hear them. He looked into the cemetery but could not see the boys because they were hidden by the tree. He hesitated a moment and then ran back to his house.     "Father, father," he yelled as he entered his house. "The cemetery. Come quick!!!" "What's the matter," the father asked? "No time to explain," the boy frantically panted. "Follow me!!!" The boy and the father ran up the country road and stopped when they reached the cemetery. They stood at the side of the road, and listened for a few moments. Then the father asked his son, "what's wrong?"     The son said, "do you hear that (he whispered)?" They both listened intently and heard the Scouts. "One for me. One for you. One for me. One for you."     The boy then blurted out to his father, "The devil and the God are dividing the souls!!!" The father grinned but was silent. A few moments later, as the Scouts completed dividing out the nuts, one Scout said to the other . . ." As soon as we get those two nuts down by the road, we'll have them all."  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    Parrot:     A young man named John received a parrot as a gift. The parrot had a bad attitude and an even worse vocabulary. Every word out of the bird's mouth was rude, obnoxious and laced with profanity.     John tried and tried to change the bird's attitude by consistently saying only polite words, playing soft music and anything else he could think of to "clean up" the bird's vocabulary.     Finally, John was fed up and he yelled at the parrot. The parrot yelled back. John shook the parrot and the parrot got angrier and even ruder. John, in desperation, threw up his hands, grabbed the bird and put him in the freezer.     For a few minutes the parrot squawked and kicked and screamed. Then suddenly there was total quiet. Not a peep was heard for over a minute. Fearing that he'd hurt the parrot, John quickly opened the door to the freezer. The parrot calmly stepped out onto John's outstretched arm and said, "I believe I may have offended you with my rude language and actions. I'm sincerely remorseful for my inappropriate transgressions and I fully intend to do everything I can to correct my rude and unforgivable behavior."     John was stunned at the change in the bird's attitude. As he was about to ask the parrot what had made such a dramatic change in his behavior, the bird continued, "May I ask what the turkey did?"  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    Last in Line:    A bus carrying only ugly people crashes into an oncoming truck and everyone inside dies. When they get to meet their maker, because of the grief they have experienced, He decides to grant them one wish each before they enter Heaven.     They're all lined up, and God asks the first one what their wish is. "I want to be gorgeous." So God snaps His fingers, and it is done. The second one in line hears this and says, "I want to be gorgeous too." Another snap of His fingers and the wish is granted.     This goes on for a while with each one asking to be gorgeous but when God is halfway down the line, the last guy in the line starts laughing. By the time there are only ten people left, this one guy is rolling on the floor, laughing his head off.     Finally, God reaches this last guy and asks him what his wish will be. The guy eventually calms down and says: "Make 'em all ugly again."     So, the next time you are last in line.......smile!  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...    CHECKING THE MAILBOX:     A man was in his front yard mowing grass when his attractive blonde female neighbor came out of the house and went straight to the mail box.     She opened it, then slammed it shut, and stormed back in the house. A little later she came out of her house and again went to the mail box and again opened it, then slammed it shut again. Angrily, back into the house she went.     As the man was getting ready to edge the lawn, here she came out again, marched to the mail box, opened it and then slammed it closed harder than ever.

So, while the blonde is standing in the circle the guy is going through her car and transporting it to his car. Then the blonde started laughing hysterically. The guy asks, "Why are you laughing? The blonde ignores him and he says, Whatever and continues to rob her car.    The blonde starts laughing again. "Why R U laughing again!" She again ignores him. Then just as the guy is about to drive away, the blonde starts laughing a third time     "Ok thats it Whats your problem, the guy shouts???

One day, a little girl was sitting and watching her mother do the dishes at the kitchen sink. She suddenly noticed that her mother had several strands of white hair sticking out in contrast to her brunette hair.    Curious, the little girl looked at her mother and asked, "Why are some of your hairs white, Mom?"    Her mother replied, "Well, every time you do something wrong and make me unhappy, one of my hairs turns white."    The little girl thought about this for a while and then asked, "Momma, how come all of grandma's hairs are white?"   .........................................    --------------------------------------...  A little girl and a little boy were at daycare. The girl approached the boy and said, "Hey Johnny, wanna play house?"    He said, "Sure! What do you want me to do?"

En el ser humano, el amor es un sentimiento real, consistente y profundo que intensifica las relaciones interpersonales entre un sujeto y otro que, partiendo de su propia insuficiencia, desea el encuentro y unin con otro ser que le haga sentirse ms completo o complementado en su existencia. El amor comienza con el sentimiento de atraccin y admiracin de un sujeto hacia otro, que puede ser o no ser correspondido.|`|L0eILZ2Vaa	El amor no te hace sufrir, lo que te hace sufrir es otro sentimiento que esta ligado al amor, bronca, celos, inseguridad, etc... pero el amor en si no implica obligatoriamente ninguna de estas cosas.. el amor es en si algo hermoso aun con todos los otros sentimientos...la verdad es que nadie te puede decir que es el amor exactamente..

Tambien se siente amor por la familia y por los amigos.  Es algo que sentimos cuando tenemos mucho en comun con una persona y sentimos mariposas en el estomago cada vez que la vemos, sentimos que queremos estar siempre junto a ella y queremos expresale todo lo que sentimos.

Si tu encuentras tu amor verdadero puede que sufras pero no tanto y obio encontraras muchassssssssss alegrias.  No te rindas sigue esforzandote x encontar tu verdadero amor.|`|0jSfrR7vaa	pues nada mas descriptivo que el apostol pablo en 1 de corintios 13, el amor es sufrido, el amor es decir presente en todo lo que necesita tu pareja, estar presentes en las buenas y las malas, sufrir porque tienes que hacer morir tu egoismo, tu jactancia natural, tu YO tiene que morir y pensar que es lo bueno para tu pareja, el amor pasa por cinco etapas, luego de pasar por la atraccion, el sentido de pertenencia, el amor filial y esas cosas  el ultimo de esas etapas es la etapa mas cumbre, mas sublime y es el amor incondicional donde te rindes a amar a esa persona, un : no importa lo que eres, lo que seras, lo que hagas o dejes de hacer yo siempre te amare.... si, se lo que vas a decir, es raro ver un amor de tal magnitud entre los mortales ya que muchos terminan divorciandose por cualquier cosa que no concuerda en su egoista forma de ver la vida, sabes?  una encuesta demostro que la mayoria de los divorcios son por la inmadurez y el egoismo de las parejas, o sea, que si las personas pudieran ser mas MADURAS y no ser EGOISTAS la mayoria de los divorcios no ocurrieran, procura tu cultivarte leyendo buenos libros acerca de este tema que buscas aqui, para que aprendas el arte de amar, porque el amor no es un sentimiento, es una decision que debes de estudiar cada dia y rendirte a los deseos de tu pareja y no solo pensar en ti ( se que muchos estaran pensando en sus mentes al leer esto en autoestima, orgullo y dignidad, pero quisiera preguntarles a esas personas: porque piensan tanto en ustedes? acaso les ha ayudado en algo tener presente estas tres palabras? les ha ayudado a crecer o a romper mas relaciones interpersonales que cambiar de camisa? no es sano odiarse pero tampoco amarse tanto, asi que equilibrense), cultivate, lee mas que en el internet libros de autores que valga la pena leer, leete Nancy Vant Pelt, Dr. James Dobson y el libro que mas me gusta leer ahora: EL AMOR QUE NO SE APAGA por el Dr. Ed Wheat.    Bendiciones y espero que aprendas a amar, ya que es un dificil arte que no todos saben captar por el hecho de que tienen que intervenir las palabras: humildad, olvidarse del yo, rendicion, abnegacion, etc, etc.    bendiciones!

Por cierto han visto como corre el erizo azul de Sony (Sonic), supongo que notaran alguna semejanza.|`|mP9SiXAgaa	Mira lo que pasa es que estas series as como Dragon Ball, z, gt, en las que el personaje a de correr por ciertos lugares, es complicado dibujarle con los brazos en movimiento como un ser normal, adems si lo  hicieran no se ve muy bien, los brazos estticos es un estndar en comics y anime, para darle un toque de incertidumbre, es para que pensemos ?corremos mas rpido con lo brazos quietos?, pues no. Pero se ve muy bien en los anime, lo acepto.

Que bueno que hablen de ella, seria peor que no lo hicieran, ademas son ms los comentarios buenos que los malos y tu yo sabemos que ella es una gran cantante y como tal despierta amor profundo y odio.    1. Dicen que es gorda y no es as    2. Dicen que canta mal y tiene una voz maravillosa que muchas quisieran poseer.    3.Dicen que no es la misma de antes, lo cual es muy cierto pues todo mundo cambia y ella lo ha hecho para bien, ademas no tendria tanto exito si fuera la misma Shakira de Pies Descalzos.    4. Dicen que no es humilde como antes, pero lo que muchos no saben es que la barranquillera vio miles de puertas cerrarse en su cara por no ser precisamente una mujer hermosa y ahora los mismos medios quieren que ella vuelva arrodillada a dar una entrevista, por favor, Shakira debe darse la importancia que tiene, ella no es Juanes que le falta darse a conocer!!!!!!    5.  Dicen que sus canciones son malas y he aqui un problema de la mayoria de las personas que oyen, pero no escuchan y si esta ultima accion no es realizada es imposible el entendimiento.  Lo que pasa es que la gente se queda en el pasado y piensa que Shakira todavia tiene 19 y canta ?donde estas corazon?     Y te digo algo para terminar, Shakira es una diosa de la msica y no solo de la colombiana sino del mundo entero, es una artista en todo el sentido de la palabra, es mujer, es inteligente y como ya has escuchado por ahi, la envidia es mejor despertarla que sentirla.    saludos    ?COLOMBIA ES PASIN?      ?Y SHAKIRA ES TALENTO COLOMBIANO?|`|AA11481777	ok, Pero no difames a otros atistas, como que Juanes solo se quedo hay? por si no lo recuerdas abrio el mundial de football, fue un exito en Japon y el resto de Europa, lo que es algo de admirar, en donde si no la ha hido tambien es en USA, por que no canta en Ingles, y  que alguien no cante en Ingles no significa que sea mediocre, ademas todos tienen derecho a descanzar y preparar nuevos proyectos, que es lo que esta haciendo Juanes ahora, Todos, Incluso Shakira que se perdio como por 2 a?os y acaba de reaparecer.     Entiendo de tu punto, pero no comparto la idea de que tengas que difamar para engrandecer a otros|`|GmBe79Ctaa	A mi me encantan los traseros grandes!|`|UWDc0eBoaa	amiga, evitate corajes, si quieres ver porque se le critica a la shakira esta date vuelva en cualquier table dance, ahi veras a mujeres con los mismos cuerpos, moviendose igual o mejor que ella y tendras la ventaja que no tendras que soportar oir sus berridos, conclusion, shakira es una taibolera con suerte que lo unicoq ue vende son sus movimientos porque de canto de plano no tiene nada, saludos|`|m4g9XWDEaa	Shakira es de las mejores cantantes actuales.  Es talentosisima, guapa, cuerpasasazo, y muy muy muy sencilla. Acabo de asistir a un concierto de ella en Monterrey el 31 de Mayo, y fue muy linda con su pblico. Se llevo la noche, el concierto estuvo fenomenal.    Todos tienen siempre en la prensa todo tipo de comentarios, pero, ?quien les hace caso??  No te molestes en ellos, y disfruta lo que te gusta.    Saludos...|`|299555099ba59b8c801803200014b771aa	Bueno pero no te enojes...  Cada quien sus gustos, no puedes pretender que todos piensen igual que tu... y por mas que te indignes no podras hacer que alguien cambie su forma de pensar... Yo desde siempre he sido fan de Gloria Trevi, y mira que he tenido que escuchar cada cosa de ella, pero sin importar lo que digan ella ha vuelto y sigue triunfando, si por un momento los fans o ella hicieramos caso de todo lo que se dice, pues Gloria no hubiera podido tener ese triunfal regreso. Y siguen habiendo cosas contra ella, pero ahi la llevamos.  Tu sigue con Shakira, y trata de no hacer corajes que te puedes enfermar...  Saludos|`|VMfOOtx2aa	es unica!!!!!!!

De las adaptaciones que se hicieron sobre comics hasta ahora me quedo con Sin City (fue la primera vez que ,en cine,  senti que estaba leyendo el comic..fabuloso)    300 es otro comic de Frank Miller pero no fue hecho "como un comic" fue directamente una pelicula y si bien lo hicieron de maravillas, a mi gusto le falto ese ingrediente que s pusieron en Sin City     Igualmente, no tengo nada que objetarle, 300 es una gran pelicula pero no sera "cine de culto" para conocedores del genero comic    saludos|`|421d4b8744657fa3da90e40fac4ca95caa	Nada, de hecho me molest que exageraran en los efectos, cuando una pelcula se vale de los efectos para que la vayan a ver al cine y se olvidan del guin, es porque debe ser un asco, eso me pas con 300, asquerosa|`|B2SPY284aa	No conozco ninguna pelicula que se llame "LOS 300"|`|EkpWA4t7aa	El aspecto visual.

La adaptacin a pesar de que no es exactamente como la nvela grfica de Frank Miller, funciona perfectamente con los pocos cambios que te introducen ms al filme. Gerard Butler hace un gran papel como Leonidas, dandole vida al personaje de la nvela de una manera impresionante.

Hotel California - Eagles (que puedo decir? es genial no lo creen? con dificultad media)  3. Highway Star - Deep Purple (Uno de los mejores solos del mejor grupo de Heavy Metal ingls, gran ejecucin de Blackmore y le daria dificultad mediaalta)  4. Let It Be - The Beatles (quien no lo ha escuchado? es tan sencillo y facil como conmovedor)  5. One - Metallica (me tomo la libertad de poner este solo en mi lista, porque aunque no es un clasico, es grandioso e innovador, con una dificultad alta, no cualquiera puede tocar ese solo)    Atte.

But if his leisure time involves solo sex, such as masturbating, engaging in phone sex, or using the Internet to view explicit sexual images or chat with an anonymous partner, she might go through the roof. And she might post to WebMD's Sex Matters? board, where the overwhelming majority of posts concerned with a mate engaging in solo sex come from women.       Of course it's true that many women as well as men find pleasure in gratifying themselves alone. So is it cheating when the partner is left out? Psychologist Willard F. Harley of White Bear Lake, Minn., says men and women are probably hardwired to react differently. "Most women will say they want their husbands' sexual expression to be exclusively with them -- no masturbation, no pornography, no strip clubs. But men don't care if their wives look at naked men. They think it gives them license to look at naked women."       Whether solo sex is a problem for a relationship is in the eye of the beholder, says David Schnarch, PhD, director of The Marriage and Family Health Center in Evergreen, Colo. "For some couples, it's a breach. For others, it's not."       When the San Jose Marital and Sexuality Centre in Santa Clara, Calif., observed an increasing number of people in therapy dealing with online sexual behavior, its researchers surveyed visitors -- 86% male and 14% female -- to the MSNBC web site. The often-quoted survey showed that 64% of the 9,177 respondents were married or in a committed relationship, and 92% did not have problems related to online sexual activities. Perhaps surprisingly, most respondents said they got excited but not aroused by viewing and chatting.       Who's in Charge of Sexual Fantasies?       Solo sex can involve human interaction, as with phone sex or Internet chatting, or it can be totally private, as with masturbation. "The common traits are that the partner isn't involved and nobody is touching anybody else," says Louanne Cole Weston, PhD, a licensed marriage and family counselor/sex therapist in Fair Oaks, Calif. "Sometimes people think when they marry that they've just gotten a license to run the life of the other person, including their sexual thoughts and feelings. That's where everybody gets up in arms about solo sex."       She says individuals are entitled to their own thoughts, even that society might deem repugnant. And to police a mate's sexual thoughts and feelings is downright unrealistic. "They're in for a shock," says Weston, who also answers questions on WebMD's Sex Matters? message board.       Harley disagrees. "My basic rule for marriages is that all your sex, including fantasies, should be with each other. First, your wife will want it that way. Second, if your wife is your exclusive sexual outlet, you'll have a much better romantic relationship."     Harley, author of His Needs, Her Needs, says psychologically there's a contrast effect involved in looking at other women and fantasizing about them. "Your wife can't measure up. Sex with her will be boring. But if you can avoid the temptation, every time you make love with her will be wonderful."       Limiting sex to one's partner may be contrary to human drives, he says, but as a sophisticated culture, we've agreed it's good for society to rein in certain drives. "We live in a monogamous society I'm not exactly sure we're wired for, but we've decided monogamy is a good idea," he says. "Pornography is really difficult to resist. It shows up in email every day. Erase it or get filters."|`|AA11561201	no. its a very useful tool in bedroom play between two people. nothing is hotter than watching your significant other pleasuring themself... ;-)

I mean really, he deserved to die =/ He cheated on his girlfriend for Sex Practice?! I mean come on! How much lower can you go than that?! Oh Wait I know how: get the girl pregnant. Brilliant Itou. I totally agree, he is a shithead -_-|`|xFrIGJEsaa	My most hated Anime character of all time by far~ I agree|`|8E8xHib5aa	From the first two episodes you would figure he is a sincere guy who wants to gain love from a girl, he has been admiring for a long time. However, forcing your girlfriend to have s**, when she clearly does not want it, is directly a sign of how he does not try to understand her. In episode 4 I still remember that he said he was getting tired of Kotohana because of that, and so.. he goes to a girl who clearly likes him and actually thought of having "practice," can actually make him a better boyfriend. Not only that he was seeing another girl behind Kotohana, but did it with I don't know, 4 more girls? How would we call that? 6 timing? I do think he deserved what he got. Well a lot of guys can learn a lot from this anime, cheating once is unforgivable, but if you cheat more than 4 times? You might end up with two pyscho girlfriends, one that killed you, and one that chopped your head off.

In fact, she's in the recent news.  http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1604348...|`|Qbf4KSRUaa	She's alive and kicking. She was probably mentioned on the view because she voiced her opinion about Beyonce singing her song to the president. Beyonce will probably make more money off the song than Etta who's been singing it for nearly 50 years.|`|WvT6tkxJaa	I don't believe she is.
FvuH3pPBaa	I've read a number of books on Arthur and Merlin over the years and the stories, whilst having the same basis, have been rather fluid.    I guess the BBC are going for a reinvention along the lines of Smallville for Superman, and from what I've read are using the mythology as a base.    No bad thing but if you want to see how different it can be see the films Merlin with Sam Neill and Excaliber. Different takes yet again.    Good show though and one I'll be looking forward to returning.|`|bhZ83dJAaa	theres loads of different story lines for it, maybe they'll just create a new one or follow one, up to the writers|`|SR3JF9Jiaa	Given the way they've monkeyed about with things already - ie Merlin and Arthur being the same age, Lancelot being a peasant (instead of the illegitamate son of the King of France, Mordred not being the incestous son of Arthur and Morganna) - I would not want to bet on it.     The Arthurian "myths" changed drastically over the years so there is not really a set canon; for example in some of the myths there are references to Morgan Le Fay, Morguise and Morganna each a different woman and 2 of them Arthur's half-sisters (but full sisters to each other).
7761a0e82f2aca8d02650411bc0f2fafaa	It's a biography/documentary about the artist.      If you were a big fan of them, I think you would buy it.  It has things like pictures and posters and booklets and all those things an obsessed fan would want =]    There are some other things like this, too.  I'm not sure what it's really called, although I think "MAXIMUM" is in the title...like I saw one with "FALL OUT BOY: MAXIMUM" or "MAROON 5: MAXIMUM".  This one, I believe, is also unauthorized.

It has five simple power chords, repeating and that is the entire song.:  http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/g/gr...    If you can only read chords, then a good song to try is Let it be by the Beatles:  http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/b/be...     A good site to look up guitar tabs or chords is www.ultimate-guitar.com  good luck|`|rIFqv8nvaa	Black Sabbath- paranoid, iron man  Any Disturbed song (solos may give u trouble)  Eye of the tiger  Beethoven's- Fur Elise, Ode to Joy  Metallica- enter sandman, master of puppets    Punk music is too easy and wont really help you learn.

Eleven months with you, I'm tripping cause it's through.  I'm standing here looking at you.    There aint no more, ghetto love.  No more, breaking up.  No more, making up.  No more, waking you up.  No more, things you hate.  No more, holidays.  No more, need to celebrate.  No more, goodnight baby.    You wanted half, just take it all.  Cause it doesn't even matter anymore.  We didn't last, cause now you're gone.  Just take everything, everything, everything.  You wanted half, you can have it all.  What the hell am I gon' do with just half of you.  Girl you can keep, even both rings.  Just take, everything, everything, everything.    I don't want the house, I'm moving out.  Can't stand staying here without you around.  All of the cars, I will sell them but just one, I will mail them. (?)  And as for the kids, I get weekends.  Baby I ain't even mad, I wish you well.  And I'll be wrong to tell you to go to hell.  Cause you're still the one I love, we're just giving up.  Guess it's best for us, can't help how it hurts.    There ain't no more honey combs.  No more, Oprah's on.  No more, Looney Tunes.  No more, Southpark with you.  No more, the phone's for me.  No more, did the doorbell ring.  No more, can you come get me.  No more, there's no more baby.    You wanted half, just take it all.  Cause it doesn't even matter anymore.  We didn't last, cause now you're gone.  Just take everything, everything, everything.  You wanted half, you can have it all.  What the hell am I gon' do with just half of you.  Girl you can keep, even both rings.  Just take, everything, everything, everything.    And if this is divorce, I don't want a war.  I don't want to fight with you no more.  Take everything, you can have everything.  Material things, your last.    (x4)  You wanted half, just take it all.  Cause it doesn't even matter anymore.  We didn't last, cause now you're gone.  Just take everything, everything, everything.  You wanted half, you can have it all.  What the hell am I gon' do with just half of you.

mzhFrm5Taa	Because if somebody asks what is up, their reply is 'what is up is up', but that gets shortened to whats up, sounding like the question but its actually the answer aswell,       its like asking ''what is blue?'''.. i would reply with what is blue is blue. rather sthan sayin all that, you'd just say whats blue    so...  you: ''whats up?''  me:.. whats up..|`|j5k0VRbPaa	um people are use to it thats what im thinking|`|88uIjItaaa	"What's Up?"|`|dDDAbqqhaa	Because they don't know how to hold a conversation|`|6pk6HnuSaa	i say "nothing much" ?    which, really, is not something a guy should say in response to "whats up?"|`|QAwwmDuDaa	Okay,what's going down then.|`|jVZ7HbDsaa	Yes it's kind of like...

You can watch it here: http://tvshack.net/movies/Twilight__2008...    Some things are cut out of it though, but I guess you can see those small parts when you rent, or buy the DVD. After you watch 72 minutes of the movie, it will stop and you'll have to wait an hour before finishing. It's worth the wait though.

I saw a woman preaching to no one,  I listened, but I just couldn't care.    Chorus  Can anyone give me what I need?  Cause I just don't have it in me.  I'd really like to make my mark, but I don't know where to star.  So I'm looking for anyone or anything.    People want something for nothing  Cause everybody wants it and they want it now  Asking questions cause they don't know the answer,  They'll never find it 'cause they don't know how.|`|rLvcVrMzaa	Don't go running away.

You are correct about the advance tickets being sold out and limited number at the door. Those tickets were not sold through Ticketmaster, just through their official seller:  http://www.nbotickets.com/default.asp?mo...    I recommend you call the venue and find out exactly what time they will start selling those remaining tickets and get there earlier than that and wait.

PumYhJSvaa	When I worked at Blockbuster we had 2 day rentals and 7 day rentals. They came to 4.30 for DVD and almost 5 dollars for blue ray. Movies usually stayed on the 2 day rental list for a month and then they switched to 7 days. This was 8 months ago.    I forgot to mention that all movies were this price unless you were in the Rewards program. If that was the case you could rent 5 movies and get the 6th one free and on certain days it was rent any of the favorites (titles not on the new release wall) get one free.     It really does vary from place to place.|`|bO9p8Kxdaa	Average is 3.99-4.99 per day|`|Hqan62xzaa	Overnight about 3 dollars, for 5 days depending on how long the movie has been around 4-6.|`|1e6eca30bdd2eb772df216bfd70b9ca4aa	In the Dallas/Fort Worth Texas area, its 1.99 per day for new releases, or 4.99 for a week.    Older titles are .99 cents per day, or 2.99 for a week.    This rate system is in other cities, but I dont know where else besides here and florida.    It all depends where you live. You should just call your local blockbuster, they're are great deals to be had at blockbuster, you should give them a visit. You could even pre-order twilight for only 5 dollars. The double disc special edition is just 22.99 at blockbuster, just like everywhere else. Plus we'll probably be open past midnight on the 20th of march so you could just come by and pick it up. Tell your friends.|`|w5KFkyGRaa	well if you get it from a red box it is a dollar for one day and then a dollar for every day after that you keep it.|`|XCVFEAC8aa	Blockbuster - $5 plus tax for a New Release and 99cents plus tax for Old'er movies (you get to keep them for 5days, but they let you keep it or them for another 5days, no late charge)    Hollywood - $4.80 plus tax for a New Release and $2.99 for Old'er movies (you get to keep them for 5days and thats it, if you keep it past that you get charged a late fee)    DrugMart - $1.50-$1.99 plus tax for a New Release and on Monday's you can Rent New Releases for 79cents plus tax. that's what I do! lol, and the Old'er movies are 99cents plus tax (New Releases you can have for 2days and past that you get a late fee and for the Old'er movies you keep them for 5days)    Plus, there is that RedBox thing out now, that you can rent movies for $1 plus tax, New'er and Old'er movies. (thing is they are due back in one day, and you need a Credit Card or a Debit Card)

It depends, if like you start out small, like a local band, send a song to a label and maybe you'll get famous..but music and acting doesn't just make you famous - doing good deeds can, too. Like, look Nelson Mandela, Ghandi (sp?) MLK..those kind of people that changed the world.|`|M1OceGNLaa	It depends on what you decide to do with your life.|`|UoZghlvCaa	heck yes!|`|hKEeN3d3aa	You have to work your best, have natural talent, and know that your chances of being famous are slim.|`|BsDv3k5iaa	probably not|`|w1OG27LHaa	You can never tell.  Maybe.....you dont have to be famous to get where you want to be.  Fame isnt all glam and having tours and getting free stuff and millions of screaming fans.  Its alot harder then people think. having pararatzi take pictures of you when you want to be left alone.....screaming fans asking you for autographs when you just want to be left alone..    So if you were to be famous then keep a level head and be yourself!  xx

BCu8rER4aa	bella has amenorrhea,...    just kidding!LOL    stephenie meyer,maybe,didnt mention anything about it because itll be really complicated,..|`|XyOsRQvgaa	i read it was because period blood is like 'dead blood', not the same as a cut. which makes sense. vampires don't want to drink from week-old corpses either, so ^^|`|R1h0bHeMaa	tampons?   and if jasper couldnt handle it then how would he go to school?   i think you're over analyzing a bit here.   and obviously edward can handle it if he successfully sucked the poison out of her blood in twilight.     no need to over analyze, just enjoy the series, its wonderful.|`|AONXdcOPaa	haha i was wondering the same thing! :P    I just told myself that it was only a book, so i guess they wouldnt go THAT DEEP! XD    But that IS a good question. I wonder if SM ever thought about it herself?|`|LjB6WpFYaa	This question was on Stephaniemeyer.com and IMDB.com as the most discussed/asked question. Steph answered it. You see, her blood from when she has her period is called Dead Blood. It doesn't apeal to vampires. lol It is uncomfortable for Edward because he knows when she has it but he's to much of a gentleman not to say anything about it. And Bella's to embarressed to ask him. But he doesn't enjoy the taste. I wonder what would happen if he did....omec bad mental picture. Okay. I'm going to cleer that out of my mind.|`|p6MNsb9Saa	lol, omg, i ask questions like that too, my friends say i think too much about it. well like others say, its dead blood. and it makes edward a little uncomfortable, but hes to embarrassed to say anything|`|jF6Sfgyyaa	they never said so i guess that wasn't a important question in the book|`|wASLHMSLaa	All the Cullen's love blood but they do there best to ignore it. Even though the girls have there period doesn't mean that they go crazy. Its just like being next to Bella, the blood makes him go crazy. But I think sense the fact that its blood from a girls period makes it a lot less appealing.

pEYRciP2aa	Universal has abandoned plans to release a new "American Pie" sequel, with original cast members, in theaters. I've no idea why - - it might possibly have something to do with the reluctance of those original "Pie" cast members, namely Alyson Hannigan, Sean William Scott and Jason Biggs, who're doing alright for themselves outside of the franchise. The original plan, we're told, was to sequelize "American Wedding" but that "just didn't work out".     the film will have a link to the first couple of films in that it's tied to the story of that legendary how-to-bonk book that the guys found in the original movie. You'll recall the book was passed onto young Kevin by his older brother Tom who explained that, "It originally started as a sex manual, this book that some guys brought back from Amsterdam in the early eighties. What to do with your tongue, things like that. And each year, it got passed on to one East student who was worthy of it." And those other students, of course, added their own techniques to the book.    Casting has not begun, but it's been suggested that some of the original "Pie" gang may still make cameos.

In most cases with rich's comes more scandal, manipulation, loss of self, and a loss of who you once where. The rich get richer while the poor still suffer. Love is something that can't ever be toped. The one thing every single breathing human has in common is simple, to be loved and to feel wanted. With out love there is no life but with out money there is struggle, stress and frustration. It is hard to 'live life to the fullest' when you live to work and work to live. I don't necessarily believe that one has to have money to be rich, one has to be satisfied with life itself and all it has to offer to be rich.    "Life is too short to wake up in the morning with regrets. So love the people that treat you right, forget about the ones that don't and believe that everything happens for a reason. If you get a chance, take it. If it changes your life, let it. Nobody said it would be easy, they just promised it would be worth it."    Be grateful; don't take even the little things for granted! Life isn't about the materialistic things, concentrating on what you drive, what you wear and who your click is pure ignorance and you tend to miss the beauty in life. Choosing friends on the simple fact for how much money they have will not bring you happiness and you will find more knives in your back and fewer shoulders to fall on. I see many blessed people with so much money at there finger tips but less respect for themselves. A saying that is common but not necessarily true: "money does not buy happiness". I never quit understood it.     I was never one to grow up with many of the finer things in life, my parents where not rich nor ready to have the responsibilities of raising children. I have struggled my whole life to get what I want. 'I will fight for what I want, but I will die for what I need'. I am seeing more and more kids with parents well off that support all of their bad habits. And its disturbing to me, I will not lie and say I am not jealous for what they have and what they are given but I am certainly not jealous of the loose of responsibilities and maturity. I see people of all ages when it comes to money loose themselves in drugs, infidelity and self worth. With money does come happiness if you are selective on what you use it with and who you may share it with. You can not loose yourself, step on the ones who helped you get to the top or forget your past because you will wind up alone, unhappy and lost.    I am not saying all but most kids with money turn to drugs more than the kids shopping at the Salvation Army. Its sad to say the least because they have so much potential to do many great things, instead they choose to live at home, take advantage of their parents money, get ****** up every night go to junior collage and sleep half the day. Instead of taking advantage and travel, get into a great school so they can in return give their children the same life they were fortunate to have, or move out of the nest and take life by the rains.    I try and understand everything from every stand point before I make a decision or judge. I put myself in their shoes and I will love you for you, I don't care where your from or what you do, just the person inside. And if you judge me on my looks before getting to know who I truly am I feel sorry for you, make your assumptions but I promise you if you ever do get to know me I wont be who you expected  Source(s):  me myself an i!

No matter how much rehabilitation a goldfish receives, the chances are that they will commit those heinous acts once again.  If you play the percentages, just based on the numbers, goldfish cannot be trusted to swim along in polite society without going back to that same pattern of abusive behavior.

Maybe $1000|`|V6dz395kaa	No, because if u get serious damage, the hospital bill will be way more than 100 dollars.|`|YfCRmWeSaa	no, I could make +$100 sellin' drugs on the street in 5 minutes.|`|c6xp3f9vaa	No they hurt alot, and for half and hour i wouldn't have any hand left.|`|9VaWal2Daa	Flat out refuse.

( lobster cant complain. he'll be in boiling water in 31 mins time)|`|fa3395ec50c737646f26f5ca2e0c0af1aa	No. Your hand is constructed in a very precise and interconnected kind of way. $100 is much to small to cover the long term or permanent damage or disfigurement which may result from such an action. Plus, a whole half an hour is plenty of time for a motivated lobster to do some real damage.|`|gcwTBz0Daa	That would hurt a lot. It wouldn't be worth $100.|`|2XQstX3xaa	Hell Yeah!

Even then I probably would want more.

Lobsters have very sharp inner apendages in a few places. It depends on what they are feeding on and their maturity and tempermant etc..    At least a stack (that's African American street talk in Pittsburgh PA for $1000).    I want a stack.|`|mqdkcHDFaa	No way!  I have a tennis tournament tomorrow, and I can't play with a hand ripped open by a lobster claw!!!!|`|mlGm0UDTaa	I'd  do it  for  $10|`|lPgm30J1aa	No.|`|1FTFCtaNaa	yes doesn't hurt that bad|`|3yNh5jO8aa	no way!|`|hJHl4HmSaa	Throw in a hooker and we'll talk.|`|5jINw4PGaa	No. That's stupid.

But uh... can you make it 200?|`|AEAS7A9naa	no  only a $100 for 30min?  $300 minimum|`|xESvfzQAaa	In a heartbeat, no questions asked.|`|RsYwCOeFaa	Hell no!|`|ab1c9b81d36c3691f0d575d773009489aa	nope|`|88f430b4f419cb62981931e8380f7878aa	Nope!|`|RKMWeMk9aa	Yes and I'll do it just for a Klondike Bar alone. :)
cuIX13BKaa	Because it keeps evolving...and changing.....and yes we are guinea pigs in the thick of it.    Garbo|`|XDfrSfrvaa	cause they do experiments on ppl|`|AI4My948aa	Cuz people still die.|`|GlP7KECoaa	hahhaah crazy|`|sZGzUmLDaa	cuz its a type of med practice|`|5l2kTANaaa	And why do you think people attending them are called "patients" lol..    Not customers or anything ahahahh    :-)|`|3YJbVYaHaa	because they have to practice on someone!!!|`|Cwll6rnnaa	because i banged your dad|`|8n3NvYQwaa	because mostly that is what they are doing...  and when they get to do it over and over again it will be the real thing...  but you have a good question and the circle I just portrade is balony isnt it?  sorry!!!|`|77a6f94018eaab3cf1e42502c3817012aa	You know as they say, "practice makes perfect."  Well, here's hoping that when they are "perfect" that I'll be that patient!|`|5fcc9R9Vaa	because everytime you go to one, they experiment on you|`|5EPzQSh5aa	because (mal)practice  makes (im)perfect
rWqrN7Apaa	Yep, it's pretty cool.|`|OjS2wJZWaa	Yes, I'm alive!|`|WdW1ga14aa	I don't feel it, I must be dead too...|`|767fd71f931856f7e4e2fe8bf027c74caa	I don't feel a pulse.  Perhaps I'm dead?|`|XvjXrCffaa	I dont feel nothing   =/|`|YW1DXceqaa	No because  the thumb has its own pulse which can interfere with detecting the main pulse at other points, where two or three fingers should be used. Fingers or the thumb must be placed near an artery and pressed gently against a firm structure, usually a bone, in order to feel the pulse. The neck and wrist are the two places to do this|`|3YJbVYaHaa	uh.........................................|`|uL8c83rOaa	hmmm...  i think i might be dead...  :\|`|AA10910187	I don't feel a pulse ........|`|nDQOwAA3aa	i feel it but it doesn't feel nasty or weird|`|e8QQW8Weaa	That's the first thing I noticed before I even opened the question! :)|`|5fcc9R9Vaa	it makes my fingers snap everytime l do that|`|Ry4Jc96Aaa	ahhhh yeahhh! hahhaha thanks for pointing this out to me, all day in school tomorrow im going to be doing that|`|IZ1ZZHyCaa	LOL!!!!

To get back home, I had to do it again, plus sing the National Anthem backwards... and poof! I'm home!    Thanks for the trip. And yea, the pulse was there.

I'd tell them about it.|`|jazKtgENaa	Give it back|`|3EyK4x2Naa	Give it back!|`|2DK4QoV9aa	give it back i know if id lost a fifty id be p***sed|`|RfPDOPEwaa	give it back    eventhough once this girl dropped 2 bucks and i bent down to pick it up and give it to her but when i got up she was nowhere in sight  so i kept it and bought myself a pizza with it for lunch lol|`|XPrsJBnvaa	That all depends....|`|zpQnda9Eaa	give it back because i know i wouldnt like that if it happened to me|`|c3ed7dc313b7c0181d81e54a991e8038aa	i'd step on it so they wouldn't be able to find it even if they noticed they dopped it.    nah, i would give it back.|`|eOb841qbaa	i would say i would give it back   but then i would be lying (:|`|aXqi9lYJaa	Honestly, I'd give it back *im not sayin that* it'd be on my concieous, and i hate that lol    i'd want to keep it though|`|yhkEyVXLaa	I would honestly give it back. Where I work, someone left a dollar behind and I didnt realize it until I was closing but I never kept it. Someone else took it. I cant do that. Its not mine to keep. Unless they truly gave it to me personally.|`|d1d16f976ab4af78c06d3dc29088aab7aa	I'd def. give it back.  I would hope that if I dropped $50 bucks, the person behind me would do the same.|`|JxDE5C85aa	Give it back,,, i don't want to steal because supposed it happened to me.|`|2eae4bf1e3779c435068e2d7d68a747faa	Give it back cause I would  want someone to give it back to me if I drop some money.      Its called karma and it can be a evil something something.|`|cbFowOWdaa	Honestly... I'd give it back. I'm not much for stealing...|`|AA10500586	It depends on the someone... if it was Donal Trump I would try to sell it back to him for $100.|`|lUYeHIWpaa	Give it back of course.|`|EVYSvkIraa	keep it   no my fault they cant keep track of their money|`|dWAB9cLbaa	probably give it back.  especially if there is someone behind me.|`|omAtDbSKaa	defo give it back =D|`|3YJbVYaHaa	give it back...........karma!!!!|`|vtmvud6eaa	Give it back|`|3zYSNopUaa	if that someone looks like a nice inof person then i would give it baq if not fu*k it|`|D6IhDUAGaa	if i took it i would guilty so i would give it back|`|zopaYdWjaa	I'd Give it back, because being a CHRISTian i have pretty good morals.  But if i were to just find the money in a bathroom stall or something i would probably wait a couple of minutes and if no one came back for it i'd just leave. =j
m3ThrbDMaa	Marla Singer, Tyler Durden, Bazooka Jane, Needs More Cowbell, Joey, Kate, Pippi Von Trapp, Buk, and others I can't think of right now...    You're my first "2nd Account Generation" contact, though...and one of my very favorites of course, but all my favorite contacts know who they are...|`|mJRYh0URaa	i don't have any|`|ytcixdv9aa	Yep, when they started allowing contacts on here (they didnt used to) my very first contact was Agent 47, yep he still is|`|hoZE1vi0aa	It was Kate 7.0 closely followed by Charlotte.  They're still contacts and I consider them friends.|`|765eed0df3acc6032568a9c4bbd1f849aa	Hi you.    The first contact that mattered to me was "Old Ugly Drunk", I think he is also "Vince".  He has a bunch of contacts that starred questions they liked, and all were interesting.  If you look at his Questions, he has a poem for his brother that is heart-rendering in it's rawness, give it a look, brilliantly written.  I think he got tired of Yahoo Answers, as I have, a bit.  Writing poems is technically a violation here, and it is tiring to get violation notices.    I love Haikus, tho.  The structure kind of forces the mind to find word sequences that harmonize..."seemingly gleeful"...how would I come up with that without being forced to use 5 syllables, lol.    How old is ur child?|`|g0YNQdL2aa	its between Champagne,teddy and bettyboo    Champagne is now Champagne 12,teddy is still teddy, I don't hear much of bettyboo anymore.|`|0d685c017cf7a74366a71e0aefe1307eaa	I honestly have no clue.

She is still around every so often, and I have grown to care for her quite a bit...though our only contact is through Y!A or e-mail.|`|AA11361233	Sorry can't remember. But I hope we are still friends. All my contacts  are a cool bunch.|`|PIeronuZaa	ZzozZ on both accounts..Rosie is playing house now lol|`|BZmlBM27aa	a girl that I don't talk to|`|2PTlXs9zaa	The Mouse, and Dawna - were two of the first.|`|6k5fhFyBaa	My first contact was this girl from Scotland, I'm not sure I've talked to her since...in fact I think she deleted her profile, or I deleted her from my list.|`|rPywKtJRaa	Ted was my first....he said something sarcastic I laughed out loud at my desk, it was just meant to be.  Awe Ted, you always have such way with words.  I feel so special brotha.  I think I need a refresher...hehehe|`|UjPArJZ6aa	Hun, I cannot remember what I did five minutes ago...    I first joined Yahoo in 2006...that's all I know.  :)|`|mBlcD6sRaa	a girl called FREDDY  i lost her when i got suspended|`|heEN0Zghaa	Prissie is the last contact on my contacts list, so she's the first contact who's still a contact.

Another real friend.  5th- KITTY. Related to Prissie.|`|7G0IyCltaa	My very first contact was my friend in real life.  She turned me on to Y!A for answering bird-related questions.  But then, Timinator found me on the dog circuit, and he became my first P&S contact.  I consider Tim to be a good friend of mine.|`|Rak2TnaXaa	Well my very first, two accounts ago (over a year ago) was some peep named Sierra.  We talked on here once in awhile until my account was suspended a few days ago.    My first on this account was Bandita Chinchilla.  She's a chill fellow|`|14A10JcLaa	it was either Naka, or Mr. Evil Genius.      I've had a few beers since then    (sure they are friends, but they better not drink my last beer)|`|oDGttkmLaa	when I started there were no contacts. THen I left for 6 months. When I came back..and they allowed contacts I do believe my first four were Bull, Bill Blasphemy, Bill the Spite guy and the Penetrator. They are all very lovely people and still on my contact list .|`|qdPtCBJeaa	My first contact was a very nice gentleman from Wales...who seems to get booted off quite a bit.  I miss him. but he does still keep in touch and yes we are friends.    edit  HB...How ironic...my guy from Wales and Lefty was yours.....|`|Hw3n0nenaa	It might have been George The Fat Pink Hippo|`|e27C5qAjaa	My first contact was John, he is a sweetheart, and I hope we will be friends forever. I feel bad, because we haven't spoken in a while, but he I'm sure he knows that I think he is the best!|`|6U9b2t4raa	Browneyez ( affectionately known as BE) was my first... how many other guys can say that !!  But seriously, she is like the sister I never wanted.    BE--  come on, you know how much I love you!! Literally, remember that night at the Super 8?|`|WT9cjXtIaa	Leftfoot was my first contact.    MB. I was thinking exactly the same thing..lol.|`|JNQezEGqaa	I could tell you....  but  I am hiding from that person...  Oh...  I am still friends with her   and  We go to church together....  But   Since I became GEM   and  More honest about my feelings and life and ideals....  I don't want her to find me in here....  I still love her to bits...  but  she is too mouthy in my "real" world....  Peace.|`|fx6pNJ5saa	Lefty my was my first.  I hardly ever see his q&a's anymore.|`|WPLKVdBKaa	i only remember the 1st few-not sure which order-EJ,mouse,chair wizard+lisa.  now ive met mouse and chat on the fone and i chat with lisa on the fone too(she is in tennesse)  ive since made more great friends+contacts..jenny,kiki,kathwa+kenn...  ive met jenny and we always yak on the fone..|`|LYGV6QNBaa	My first contact was Pierced Dude, he is from the UK. We hit it off from the very get go and did become friends. He kept me laughing with his questions and his answers, he was my P&S sidekick. He left Y!A almost a year ago and I do miss his humor but we stay in touch by email, phone, and he mails me small things from the UK from time to time.|`|SIKCfUtjaa	my first contact was someone called milkyway. who i think no longer has an account.. i couldnt even tell you why i added them.. its a bit sad i know.|`|vzWGml26aa	it was actually your regwa. and yes we are still friends. close no, but still friends. then you came along. the family followed after that.|`|IKCfT9tnaa	Broken Angel and Mag.  Seldom see Mag here anymore and Broken Angel isn't here any more but we are friends in our real worlds!

lbgoHgDkaa	don't worry about it too much.  I don't.  it happens all the time.  if you want your answer to be more unique then add more detail instead of just saying "yes" or "no".  tell why.|`|xNYUZZvlaa	Yeah, but sometimes it just coincidence that you have kind of the same answer. I don't let it get to me, especially since some questions you have to answer with the same kind of answer(:|`|4SGBr8cWaa	i usually scan the answers & skip it if someone has what i was going to say|`|AA11818174	Sometimes so I try not to look at the other answers.

They're obviously copying YOU...|`|i5dTQhoVaa	Some answers are bound to be similar to others. Just look how many people are on here answering. I answer how i feel and if it's similar to another that's just the way it goes, as far as i'm concerned|`|86acf988bd253bcd1586d895b2e5a43aaa	That's exactly why I post my answer before reading the others.|`|f749d2cce22aad6eb2d7f1c842fa5678aa	yes i feel like that all the time|`|3yNh5jO8aa	sometimes, but i usually answer before i look at other people's answers. my conscience is clear.|`|gli7SbBoaa	Not really.  But I do hate when someone answers before you and goes back to edit their answer with your answer.|`|INf502UUaa	Somtimes, it depends on the question.|`|oDUuAs9Raa	I think: "great minds think alike"..  :)
UjPArJZ6aa	Unlike chickens, they don't come 'cheep'...    Poll: Hood ornaments.|`|AMFajJCgaa	It should be, we're your friends.|`|44eKDvkhaa	I love how your mind works in mysterious ways.    hood ornaments

Kaptp4pqaa	Well I would leave some dirty dishes in it.  As for the bathroom maybe shut the door when you are not home or are in bed.  Maybe even buy a piece of wood to cover the sink for a while and maybe the cat will forget all about it after a while.|`|opQVE4UWaa	Gilly lets her p ussy get wet every night.|`|qFOdHHCDaa	Awww that is so cute (:|`|73KnE9Kmaa	Put a board over it so it cant get in. or take it to bed with you. its eyes will light up during the night and you can play cat-a-peek-a-boo.......?|`|G3czAd0caa	run run ruuuuuuuuunnnnnnnn the water|`|N0YH5RRuaa	Put water in it.

Cats are not daft - fleas cannot breed on metal or porcelain, and as these surfaces are cold they tend not to run about so much and, indeed , will vacate the cat in search of a more fertile biting arena.     Go to a vet (with the cat) and get some Frontline flea spray.|`|8FO52r0Maa	turn the water on him|`|c6ff08c632b9e5165a8a3d098d3a1710aa	Teach her/ him to sleep in the toilet?

I have a thick and untamed beard.|`|UpJbXh7Vaa	It used to happen to me all the time when i was little, but backwards. i had really short hair and people always thought i was a guy.|`|wT9KXIC0aa	When somebody called my house and asked to talk to my friend they called me ma'am.|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	never, maybe you should change how you look/dress|`|UvknGheTaa	nope because I am a girl.. lol but yeah I can see how you would be offended|`|UXOwJlHdaa	when I was 3 years old|`|PizXrl2oaa	a friend of mine (a guy) has been called "Sir..

Yessssssssssss?????? Can I HELP you???   Seeing eye dog, or something?     ( I had a moustache and beard , ya see. )|`|Q7EN2Zqbaa	I think from a distance when I was younger, the first couple years of high school I was way into Led Zeppelin and was really skinny and had really long hair.|`|yQn34zO7aa	hahahha not very often but my dads done that to someone else before and im sry but its hilarious wen it happens|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	i did that to a guy at work, called him a she and his expression on his face was priceless. it was pretty funny.|`|IqoRBVUTaa	I've been told that, God made a mistake and accidentally put a guy's mind in a girls body.....Yeah, there mistake.|`|6oZagLCvaa	I am a lesbian trapped in a mans body,, life is great|`|0ePwSnfWaa	i sometimes call boys she because i get mixed up haha|`|fArUNIfRaa	look your still a young girl  just relax......and everything will be better   just don't listen to what people say.|`|md0w4Gx1aa	LOL no. Sorry.|`|Tupv1o9Daa	I hate them situations.. if u don't know if someones a guy or a girl. Wen i am in this situation its usually because sometimes guys may have a pretty feature or something that i've never seen a guy have... i see y u get offended though.. but i bet ur still hot :)|`|xy4enYFyaa	I got asked if I was a boy when I was younger, like about 6,7, or 8 stupid mom made me get bowl cuts|`|AqWJDMGSaa	it probably means your cute, kind of guy i would go for.|`|G4Clnn6paa	no  mainly because i'm not a guy|`|tGdwYcqoaa	if you have long hair, lose it. don't dress in a way where you can be mistaken for one. don't act like one either.    you can easily fix the skinny part. eat at more food, work out, and drink whey protein. gain some pounds. if you're also one of those guys who wears earrings....that's a big no-no.|`|2hV2fmZEaa	yes. i have long hair, and from behind, i guess that some people would think im a girl. ive actually had my *** grabbed by some dude before. i was pissed.|`|3xRK3i4maa	I'm a skinny girl (i.e. no shape, like a boy) and when I had my hair cut short, one day I went to the store with my brother and someone must have thought I was a guy, because on the way to the store some kid yelled "f a g s" out the window of his car as he drove by. It was hilarious as hell and we laughed so hard over it. Just laugh at people who mistake you for something you're not. They're rude and they don't know what they're talking about.|`|gh9YQCymaa	So i have long hair, but I am so obviously a guy, I am a big guy and I guess I do kinda have a baby face but still, everyone can tell after 5 seconds that I am a guy! well this one lady at a cornerstore said, "I can help you here Sir" and turned her head to grab a bag, then she did a double take and looked back at me and commented/questioned, "Ma'am?!" and I looked at her like she was crazy and then she just stared at me a good 5 seconds and came to her final unsure conclusion... "Boy..."    I looked at this bizzatch and said, "Did you just call me SirMa'amBoy?" her face turned BRIGHT red and was like, "give me my damn cigarettes!" and I left. After thinking about it I realized it to embrace my new name, for about a month or so, I introduced myself everywhere as SirMa'amBoy...

"Never going to bed angry" is not a realistic goal.  After some sleep, I usually find myself understanding that I was a jerk, and then I get very apologetic.  When I am tired, I just get stubborn and argue more.|`|2XQstX3xaa	We usually sleep on it but every thing is forgiven by morning. We're a weird couple like that. After sleep we totally forget everything.

Part of the reason they are the best things is BECAUSE they are free ;)|`|jLwCzblBaa	*looks up* One wonders how he knows that, hehehe    Er, i have no idea Chaz, maybe it is for all the lovely clothes they buy to make themselves look so pretty.|`|it3ecbVEaa	looks up steve and how do you know that..!!!!    its because of all the makeup they have to buy, can you imagine how many times a night they have to re do it, if they get load of customers that is..|`|IJanDRg7aa	If you want to have sex, get married.

Some people are happy to be miserable because life is too boring for them.|`|W3gpfzj2aa	i don't know. But I know what you mean! i remember more of the bad things or embarrassing things than the good things!|`|c3Ep0Ky3aa	I don't know.|`|EfxExqrkaa	you concentrate and ponder harder on the bad things|`|b5ppFsn2aa	maybe the bad things happen more often? :-/ i would agree with that too at the moment..aghh LIFE!

That made me spend 3 days in a psych ward because I had no idea what "contract for safety" meant or "suicidal thoughts with a plan."|`|oDGttkmLaa	yes :(   I like to have a full understanding of things.

Whether it's Feast or Famine. :)    (((((Lydia)))))|`|aBPNeRA9aa	Hamburger helper!|`|SS5py9jIaa	I have had a lot of experience in this area. Poeple without a lot of money who live in a community where there are lots of other people who do not have a lot of money eat takeaway food so that they do not have to share it with all the neighbour's children.... However, assuming you are not in that situation, if you dont have a lot of money to spend then eat rice... boiled fried baked... add some fresh vegetables (preferably green) to the rice.. steamed or stir fried... add some peanut butter to the rice, add some sweet soy sauce to the mix...     Another dish is potato and cabbage... lightly fry the potato... add cabbage... soy sauce, tomato sauce... eat with rice (see above).    Porridge.. just eat oats (carbs) for breakfast... a slice of wholemeal bread (fibre) with some peanut butter (protien and good fat).    Fresh salad... lots of red cabbage, radish, letucce, tomato, carrot, cucumber, celery... a dash of balsamic vinegar, seeded mustard and olive oil.    Fruit... bananas.. if they are cheap in your area... pick whatever is in season.    Fish if you can get it. Meat.. look for marked down red meat and grill. Dont buy marked down chicken!|`|18K7ucsEaa	Corn dogs, hot pockets, spagetti-os, french fries LOL    hope things turn around for ya!    :-D|`|9kjpm2oQaa	I am broke so we eat hot dog [kids luv em'] mac n cheese, Hamburger Helper,soup ,sandwiches,or frozen dinners|`|p03Jc7eHaa	mac/cheese with a can of mushroom soup added|`|AI4My948aa	Kraft mac & cheese.|`|3MB1Wsdaaa	Things made with macaroni and chopped meat-mexican pasta, meatloaf etc.|`|qsuYKa3naa	I always have dry milk & cereal in the house for those times.  Another cheap staple is dry beans.

sPUOcQ21aa	yes, totally every time. well when me and my boyfriend ,ex-boyfriend now,well i was listening to his ipod and he told me that he really like this song it was rape me by nirvana and i made me laugh so hard and everytime i hear that song or someone says anything about nirvana i think of that song then him.|`|B1GjfOUdaa	Quite a few but none recently.|`|qIILwjsraa	You set me free by michelle branch because it reminds me of all the risks i took in life and how they helped me.    Please pick me for best answer!|`|HAhm1TUoaa	There was a cassette of children's songs that my parents used to play for me and my brothers in the car when we were on summer holiday. So there are certain songs that remind me of sitting in a car seat, picking at the foam padding through a hole in the material.|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	Hell yes. My whole life has a soundtrack|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	Yes, the sit com "Goodnight Sweetheart" was my lullaby song which my Mum used to sing to me.  I used to enjoy watching it but kept the sound muted till I knew the music had ended because it always left me feeling very sad that I no longer had a Mum.|`|9VaWal2Daa	Interesting enough....... I have often thought Billy Joel was spying on me to write his songs.     I have been follwing his career forever, and his material would always eerily match my life in many bizarre ways.     When he released "Innocent man".......it was really COSMIC.     many of his songs; I swear could almost be autobiographical.   it's freaky.|`|g0evAXSGaa	flake by jack johnson reminds me of one of my best friends... just cuz, idk why exactly...|`|zijhBbBaaa	Yeah,  Coldplay songs remind me of when I went to see Coldplay (lol they are AMAZING! BEST BAND EVER! ha)  And  A milli by lil wayne reminds me of me because my name is Emily lmao    This answer makes me sound so stupid lol|`|pmkdQKEvaa	yeaaaaaaah lots do but particularly everytime - simple plan, make me think how much i miss someone and just need to see them for one day :( also here without you by 3 doors down for the same reason|`|sPScyaF6aa	LOL!!!!

From that point on, you would be my permanent distraction.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I would swear in a different language|`|jreon8v0aa	It would be fine.

auFmP7J1aa	IWouldn'tWannaBeCremated,  ButIGuess,YouDoNotTakeUpAsMuch  Space.   AndYourLovedOneCouldKeepYou.  FreakyThough,ToMe|`|9zrNQryYaa	No, it does not. But being buried in the cold cold ground does not seem all that appealing, either. Besides, funerals are the biggest scam going.|`|mNC4r3EIaa	I don't get it either. Someone could just dispose the body and give the surviving family members a bunch of ashes from a campfire, and you wouldn't know the difference. Kinda freaky if you ask me...especially how hot it has to get before a body can become ashes.|`|wT9KXIC0aa	I'd rather my body being burnt into a pile of ashes then rotting in a wooden box in the ground, having maggots eating me, and all that. So, getting your body burnt mightn't seam pleasant, but it's a lot more pleasant than being shove in a hole.|`|GlP7KECoaa	yur dead....you dnt feel it|`|AI4My948aa	I know what you mean.  rotting in the ground seems like much more fun.|`|fSRqz7aYaa	Well, your body isn't good for much else, so why not give parts of it to people you love?|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Because it's nice for everyone to have a "piece" of you kind of, and you can be spread to places you love like the beach or the mountains... I think it's better than rotting in the earth.|`|peq2gAw6aa	idk depends how you look at it i guess:)|`|jBh1on7yaa	actually they are more so crushed than burnt.  also  YOU ARE DEAD how would you know if its pleasant or not|`|F5Tf0Wowaa	its cheaper and you dont take up space|`|eI5rgLcraa	better than being so self important to waste all that space once you're dead|`|XB8oRdeyaa	what's the difference...you're dead. your soul lives forever but the body is lifeless. i don't think you would feel it plus you're not taking up space in the earth.|`|0O3JvmE7aa	I won't be taking up space in an increasingly crowded world,my family won't be wasting money on a casket,and I'll be spread on my family's land,so all in all,it sounds pretty pleasant to me.|`|cZzl472Faa	After watching numerous episodes of CSI, I want to be cremated. Let it be known !|`|xYcDPAq0aa	yeah i think the same   i know you don't feel it and your dead but the idea of your whole body been in flames is an unpleasant thought. Then i don't like the idea rotting in the ground ethier so i'm still undecided.|`|XjcrMNBuaa	who cares what u think  its a dead effin body..let em do with it what they please  my moms donating hers to forensic sciences  my granny was cremated  i wanna be buried in the woods..no casket|`|41479d464ed912b4157bcb71a2bae530aa	maybe after they die they don't want their bodies to be eaten by worms|`|EpVNEzcSaa	you're dead anyway, so it's not like you feel it..  i'd rather be burned than have to rot.   plus, its more sanitary, and environmentally safe.|`|z7wlbXBUaa	my dad wants to be cremated and be put in our HUGE family graden. I told him he was crazy!!!|`|23DiWU58aa	maybe not, but being buried 6 feet under earth doesn't appeal much either!|`|M5XjqI40aa	Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.    When you're dead you are totally unaware of what is happening to your former body.    Isn't it more unpleasant to think of being embalmed and lying in the ground, cold and stiff, slowly decomposing over hundreds of years.    Graves are a waste of space.    I want my ashes to be scattered so that I can return to the ecosystem. Thinking of my former molecules becoming part of a tree, or a blade of grass is more appealing than thinking of my lifeless body lying in a dark damp grave.|`|uaq8OSUjaa	It's better than lying there rotting for the rest of eternity|`|AA11609168	your dead, what does it matter?|`|DSp6zjeGaa	its better than worms eating you!|`|elECfJ52aa	your dead when your burnt ashes take up less room and god is not making anymore land

If you establish a pattern of negative energy it will just keep building up.      If you establish a pattern of dealing with people this way, you will have a very difficult time adjusting to work - managers don't put up with petty tit-for-tat stuff.

In order to see each other I would have to come over in the early morning between our two jobs and classes. It was that, or we couldnt see each other during the week. He started sleeping out on the couch because his roommate that shared a room with him started a graveyard shift and needed his sleep. One morning, before the sun came up, I had just let myself in to his apartment, and saw that his alarm clock was by the couch so that he wouldnt sleep through class. He hadnt been expecting me so I carefully walked through the pitch black apartment trying not to trip over anything. I wanted to surprise him with a wake up kiss, so I knelt down and started to kiss him. It was turning quite passionate when all of the sudden he went completely rigid. I sat up to see what was wrong and it wasnt my fiance at all. It was some random guy who had just happened to stay overnight. I thought I was going to die! All I could pathetically say was, Sorry, I thought you were my fiance. His reply Well, after he stopped laughing and could finally take a breath said Its all good.    http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com  http://www.yourembarrassingmoments.com/s...|`|GiHOnv54aa	When I was trying to look good getting out the pool at my friend's 16th pool party, in a white bikini.

Then he says to the guy, "What are you going to do with the potato?" and that person says "Eat it" being all funny, but the worst is when that kkids goes, "Cause my friend (_my name_) wants some french fries!" and i was like not me, her! but it was funny, but at lunch all these people came up to me and were like too bad you had to wait this long for the potatoes!      edit: and my stomach was growling after all that, when the room got all quiet because of the teacher talking! people around me heard it! omg im dying|`|c6HfikOHaa	when i was young i lived opposite my school across the road from me was a car park for the school were all the school buses collected people b4 and after school .once when i was ill i got up to close a plain sheet double glazed window when i heard all the buses everyone i new started waving to me then i suddenly realised i was .....NAKED IT TOOK A WHILE TO GET OVER

She was funny looking too cuz she had an overbite haha. Oh yeah and she once got a box stuck on her head and she didn't even try to get it off. She just kept walking around with it on- walking into walls and everything. She just didn't care|`|NbjJiSJJaa	lol    My dog (a 130 lb.

Thats HILARIOUS!! haha!!    Well, I got a rabbit called Twilight =D (the little bugger haha!!) and she/he (dont know what it is because its still a baby) it runs arounds in the garden and me, my dad and little brother has to chase it so my dad gets a brush and tries to catch it haha!! its like a circus! my dad swinging a brush about, my little brother keeps falling over for it and im chasing it around to put it back in the hutch!! haha!! we are not cruel to it btw because i love animals and would never halm an animal but we needed to get the rabbit back in its hutch!     And i used to live at my nans a while back and she has a little yorkshire terrior puppy called Molly and whenever we was in the livingroom with the door shut, Molly scratches the door with her paw in the hall and whenever we open the door for her she just looks at you as if shes a tramp! she has those big puppy dog eyes sparkling at you and you feel like hugging her but when you try to hug her she just runs off haha!! shes just tormenting you though... but sometimes when she scratches the door, she runs upstairs and she looks down before you could open the door and you see a little scruffy, cute puppy looking at you growling (playing) at you!! HAHA!! its hilarious!! so when you close the door again, she scratches the door again and when you open the door she is up the stairs again!! the bugger! haha! she just repeats it lol!!    Whenever your watching tv or something, Molly lies not far from you and stares at you... Molly kinda growls at you for you attention (only a little growl. not angry growl she justs pulls this funny face and growls at you very quiet haha!!) so when you look at her, her ears goes down and her tail wagges haha!! i love her!!     Whenever your face is near Molly and your just looking at her... molly does this little funny face... like when a dog growls, they show their teeth but she kinda shows a bit of her teeth and just stares at you and soon enough she just bites your nose haha!!

1263731b76a5881b98bbd0aacec9a2cdaa	"Leave Out all the Rest" is very good as it talks about wanting to be remembered for all the good things a person has done rather than the negative things. "What I've Done" is equally good with more of a this-life focus rather than "Leave Out all the Rest," which works more like a eulogy from a person who has passed on.    "Somewhere I Belong," "Breaking the Habit," "Numb," and "Runaway" all tout a message of seeking to get away from negative influences (both inside and out) and striving to be a better person. Likewise, "Faint" sings about determination and holding your head up despite discouragement.|`|e159ff754bab3c5313912671fb794ef9aa	What I've Done...awesome stuff.

JTu1cLkYaa	The human psyche. You can point these people to sites that will give them the answer or you can try to explain it to them in great detail and they will still continue to agree with what the shysters and doomsayers are saying. There are people who just do not want to know the truth if it goes against what they want to believe.|`|igI5yX0vaa	Okay, what's all this about knowledge and something called google?|`|Lq2psnTqaa	people are dumb...seriously|`|7scxfyABaa	it's something to argue about and you know us    we LOVE to argue|`|dDDAbqqhaa	because there are some really really really dumb people in this world|`|9iNCQkWlaa	How many of these doomsday prophecies have we lived thru so far?|`|xESvfzQAaa	Same reason everyone got worked up over the Y2K bug.

EDIT: Don't believe it. If you're wrong, nobody's alive to know. If you're right, then congratulations, you're right and everyone knows.|`|AA11306089	It's so outrageous that it's actaully believeable..for someee people. I mean, come on, all of the planets are going to align in 2012. The poles are going to switch. Entire countries are going to flood and all of the nukes are gonna go off. It's crazy right..? But it's scary too, that's why some people think its true.. we're programmed to believe in the worst.|`|AA11609168	ummmm well the earth does complete a 'wobble' on its axis -  thats something.     And you are right too, Einstein was an idiot with his whole 'pole shift' theory...I mean when has that guy ever been right?|`|J9sJz46Eaa	and how do you know google is right?|`|F0q3gi5Gaa	dumbsh!ts, people these days. dont believe the mayans they were all on crack.|`|4wHjtkJXaa	why are you getting worked up that people are gettign worked up?|`|ZVSZZ6qHaa	Gives them something to worry about until the next thing.|`|ba46a3ce2e28f5140e36ee11c824ec41aa	no kidding if thats the end of the world howcome the myans are already gone?|`|JTSNljLhaa	2000 nothing  6/6/06 nothing  2012 you guest it......nothing|`|RtJ11zUZaa	I guess some people jsut need drama and hysteria to make their lives worth living.|`|YV2n51hqaa	*laughs* ~20 seconds later~ "I don't get it..."  ...  ...|`|nh04ZJnQaa	thank you for agreeing with me! No wonder the aztecs/mayans were wiped out, because they created b.s.     it's like saying you'll die tomorrow, approximately at:    we never know the future.|`|2cJmwGIuaa	i unno rely , i now it won't rely happen but there is a part of my mind that says it might       but the new danger is in liek 2027 or sumthing when this asteroid comes dangerously close to the earth     the only real danger is , of course , Global Warming , it will end us if anything .|`|MdXwD2JSaa	DOES IT|`|02c048e10733ab7f5a7f2b2faf444d62aa	You can't argue with people who just want to worry.

DXXpHKupaa	Who am I to judge you in the first place?|`|cOv322B0aa	nope you would hotter though haha|`|C5QV222iaa	probably, itd just be weird being around a bi person, im not into that kinda stuff.|`|4wvm4RBxaa	Yes, i would.|`|EmWbvWEQaa	no i absolutely would think of you exactly the same. Unless you were all like oh lets do the nasty like one of my bi friends used to. and she wanted us to masturbate together, ICK! I would be the same way though if you were a guy friend who was straight who wanted to do those things.|`|456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Nope. =]|`|lHzBJA4eaa	Bi isn't a type ,it's a choice and a reflection of your attitude.Girls who have genuine relationships are lesbians.Unfortunately Lesbians rarely like one another and want a feminine girl ( lesbians are not feminine) and date confused girls .This is bad for their selves mostly as the girl will eventually leave as she cannot have a legitimate relationship this way and the lesbian will get hurt.   So ya, it will show your attitude.Not a prob for me but for some it may well be|`|xxSGhywoaa	No, but I wouldn't care either.|`|Kbgc6x5raa	naw|`|hBmafVYoaa	No|`|79F1VhEJaa	no|`|yZAcwN3haa	not at all, bring your friend!|`|TYl7kmPeaa	i wouldnt  but i am sure there are some that will|`|elECfJ52aa	I could not care less either way|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Not really. :)|`|26eb811a3389534c3b02e6e2bb665965aa	I judge no one.|`|SjNwUpAOaa	YES!

Buuutt...if I did know you, I'd ask you to bring a friend to the bedroom so we can play hide the sausage.|`|feUMAvgLaa	I wouldn't judge you, but I would feel different around you if you were straight|`|kOo9KgZ5aa	no|`|DWeGV8Akaa	no because your still HHHOOTTT and hee hee to tell you the truth ... well im aint goin to say it on here  ;)   but no not really ...|`|n35GuKneaa	I only jugde personitatly.|`|K0iFV73Gaa	Yes because whether your straight or not changes your personality. It is a piece of you but if you were lesbian then we would have a lot in common, but also I would like it better if you were straight. Honestly!|`|1FTFCtaNaa	probably|`|87CAVhs2aa	No...|`|DLjfE0S7aa	Nope. :) Would you to me?|`|m2PlMByKaa	you may not be bi but i get the vibe you're curious. xP|`|89defcc97f06bb462c28a75ae2e1b729aa	Nope.|`|uPRYwa3zaa	no|`|yqSJ2FR8aa	nope|`|bGkQSS68aa	no|`|C9etNNBAaa	never.  not at all.|`|oP8blO9Paa	nope|`|o9JRX2p7aa	no|`|YxMh2aAOaa	yes the word **** pops up in my head when i see a hot bi girl|`|9VaWal2Daa	Judge not , lest ye be judged.     Words to live by.|`|KPFBbi06aa	nope|`|KT0UTX8taa	No... not at all...|`|7CC9OI2Maa	No!  my distant best friend kept it from me for two years! and just told me today because she was scared i wouldn't like her anymore.  And i don't even have a problem witth it the only thign wrong was that she kept it from me.|`|mr5qcM3Laa	Nope... each to his own as I always say|`|ZJH2tun5aa	how encouraging to see all those no responses. makes me all warm and fuzzy. I also say no.|`|8HtC4j33aa	nope not at all! you be whatcha want to.    as long as i have nothing to do with it !|`|NXrYtxFmaa	i'd love you more, specially if i could watch and join in.|`|o4L80PvBaa	nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo...|`|3xRK3i4maa	no one should judge anybody no matter what. That is God's job and His alone.|`|rXq7ssXBaa	I'm bi...    I think I've gotten more strange reactions from girls than from guys when I open up about sexual orientation.    But haha only about 4% of straight men think that dating a bisexual girl is a turn off!|`|99Te46cVaa	never  no  not at all|`|T7JrVkKIaa	No, I don't judge someone on their sexuality. That's silly.     Anyway, I'd be a hypocrite if I did  =]    Too bad you're not bi.. You're hawtt =P|`|FW2WRGnjaa	I wouldn't.  It's not right to judge on sexual orientation.|`|24d9HoJTaa	Most likely, then again I don't know you. Sadly when I think of bi it's like a Shot of Love because I'm not exposed to these things.|`|pQ8ZcPYraa	these days its a lot easier to be gay lesbian or bi.   Leave the judging to the old people   we dont care|`|Ug1raqevaa	I might be alittle uneasy at first....but I would still be your friend. As long as you never tried to make a "move" on me,|`|2a082AkHaa	Of course not. It may just come as a surprise to some people around you (parents perhaps?) but I don't think anyone else would judge you. At least, not me. :)    It's okay to be bisexual. You get the best of both worlds ;)|`|mYGbxuCAaa	NO way! be who ha) i know ur not bi, i know ur curiosity but no i wouldnr!|`|6ZNLbNsGaa	Never.I'm bi:)|`|ci8TMMFkaa	i personally wouldnt. nowadays its just so open to everyone. but older ppl may criticize..|`|bnPufBlAaa	Nope...what you do on your private time is no business of mine...Thats why we have locks on the doors, have fun eating in bed...!!!|`|NUW5KONtaa	No..|`|blRd1nZWaa	Not at all.|`|a902338a578fab048205b9240ad156faaa	yes

Oh, and I can't forget the great pedal steel player, Robert Randolph!|`|zFb022Iiaa	Muddy Waters  Robert Cray  Etta James  Bobby Bland  Newer I like Keb Mo|`|vXavvgQXaa	keep in mind that muddy Waters Robert Johnson types are great but are often a bit repetative.  Also consider the Allman Brothers, as well as Elmore James, and Howlin' Wolf.|`|b33d9540a5f5fce74fa36171a90569b1aa	freddie king,albert king,stevie ray vaughan,albert collins,howling wolf,magic sam,sonny boy williamson, junior wells,cream,taste,rory gallagher|`|cQzdsbbiaa	Some lesser knowns:  Sean Costello  Watermelon Slim & the Workers  Homemade Jamz Band (Amazing band of siblings - check them out on youtube)  Jon Cleary    Also Jeff Heally's posthumous album "Mess o' Blues" is awesome!  A good intro to an older artist is "The London Sessions" - Howling Wolf & Hubert Sumlin, with Clapton and a few others young bucks of the time.
