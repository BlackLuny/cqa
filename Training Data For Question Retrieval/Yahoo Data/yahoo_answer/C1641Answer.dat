Mountains and open spaces are so close to all the major cities that you could easily keep a horse and still live close to malls and stores.|`|gNfKqZzaaa	I agree, California. Horses are huge here! Western and english. Competitive and non-competitive. Practically every town has many barns (and trails!) Our malls are quite spectacular too :) What I love is that horse barns are right outside of the cities. It is about 10 minutes from my barn to an amazing mall. You can do it all in 1 day!

I don't know what you are thinking about doing in the UP, but if you want to see the sights, then possibly you may want to bring a tent and camp at some of the forest state parks for the night.

Having been to both cities I can tell you a lot.  Phoenix is just your average city out west.  Las Vegas, on the other hand is a city for young people, and much more to do.  Las Vegas is also one of the fastest growing cities in the US so the area is also very new.  I wouldn't think twice about going to Las Vegas.  Also someone else mentioned about LA.  Las Vegas is much closer so travelling to the west coast area and LA is much easier.

YTB is a publicly traded company (ticker symbol YTBL.PK) that was founded in Feb. 2001.<br>  <br>  The YTB companies offer two unique and powerful business opportunities, that of referring travel agent or "RTA" and that of independent marketing representative or "REP". The travel agent opportunity has an initial fee under $500 and a monthly license fee of $49.95. There is no fee or travel agency purchase required to be a REP. You may choose to participate in one or both opportunities. <br>  <br>  YTB sells travel via the internet through its network of YTB referring travel agents (RTAs). Because of the large volume of travel the YTB network sells, the prices for travel booked through YTB agents is competitive with the discount travel companies. VERY often (my estimation is about 95% of the time) YTB will be as cheap or even cheaper than anyone else.<br>  <br>  What kind of travel do YTB referring travel agents sell? They sell airline tickets from over 60 major airlines, rooms from over 55,000 hotels and resorts, cruises from 27 different cruise lines, car rental, tours and all-inclusive packages from the top companies, golf packages, honeymoon registry, event tickets, and more. You can even order flowers, set up golf tee times, expedite your passport and exchange foreign currency - all from a 1-stop shopping travel portal. ANY commissionable travel of any kind can be handled by a YTB RTA.<br>  <br>  Please feel free to visit www.4JTRAVEL.com for more information. You can click on the 'Company Presentation' link in the middle of the page to watch a video, or you can click on the 'Join Now' link just below it to become a member of YTB.<br>  <br>  YTB is very unique in that it has several important features that no other company has. For example, it has (1) a powerful compensation plan that is so unique it has been copyrighted, (2) a written guarantee that if you do not earn $6,000 in a year by handing out 25 Success From Home magazines (YTB was featured in one earlier in 2007) every month, they will write you a check for the difference , (3) a bill of rights, an official legal document filed with the states, that protects the YTB distributors.<br>  <br>  The YTB bonus structure allows for $1,000 to $1,000,000 to be paid in individual bonuses. It is important to note that as of this date, there have been 7 one million dollar bonus checks paid to 7 different YTB RTAs. This proves that the bonus program works, and is not just theoretical or just paying the one or two people at the top.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, based on the strength of the compensation plan and the company itself, YTB will become the #1 internet travel company and will create more millionaires than any other network marketing company. Travel is a $7 trillion industry worldwide, and is projected to double within 5 to 10 years! Every 8 seconds - for the next 20 years - a baby boomer will turn 60.

hr1MAbRzaa	it's always wise to be well prepared. bring a map but study your route ahead of time. time is precious. don't waste it; enjoy it!|`|74VUE4T8aa	both, bring the map but ask locals for directions.  u may find out some interesting sidebars form talking to locals, places to stay away from and places more interesting to go.|`|VGMFkcziaa	ALways bring a map with you and asking locals for direction also good too but still always bring the map.|`|sTFa6dutaa	there's a reason maps are folded and given away at car rental companies so tourists can coveniently carry them<br>  <br>  <br>  And<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  use them!|`|NiRFYhVDaa	you can do both..i think it is much wiser....maps arent that specific as to small roads and some landmarks|`|7ONAv4vYaa	It is always a must to bring a map..

So what if people got a little crazy....we have had nothing but war, lost jobs, doom and gloom news on the tv lately.

Y4WHMHpqaa	Wow, a first timer.  How exciting!!!  You are going to have so much fun.  <br>  <br>  As a rule of thumb, I wear something that is.....<br>  1.  comfortable, somewhat loosefitting, usually layered as it           <br>       does get cold with everyone blasting their air around the<br>        cabin.   Me too sometimes, as it stuffy.<br>  <br>  2.  my slide in shoes, easy on easy off because you will have to take it off when going     through security,  I will bring socks if it gets cold on the plane .<br>  <br>  3.  I bring my own small, fuzzy blanket.  I have been given some really nasty ones in the past and don't care to go that route again.   The layering helps if you get cold though.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|f0QJ0TWiaa	me dnt know|`|aOYfAHvUaa	Well if it is not for business wear some Jeans or if you want to be more confy than that wear some sweat pants, snickers and a nice blouse. I think Im doing that the next time I travel, I always wear jeans.. anyways I knew a girl ( about my age ) and she was wearing her pijamas and sweatshirt. if you are carrying to much laugage you might need the jeans cuz those are much fresher..|`|kCDeIYX1aa	Comfort over fashion.  Make sure you have shoes that are really comfortable and allow your feet to expand/swell during flight.  Also, I find that even if I'm flying in the summer, I'm better off wearing pants and socks and always bring a long-sleeve shirt with me on the plane.  It's tempting to wear shorts and flip-flops, but the cabins can get pretty cool and I've regretted it every time I've gone with less clothing.  Plus, if you're going to try to sleep on the flight, being cold doesn't help (even those little blankets they sometimes hand out aren't great at keeping me warm).|`|tGsby7kcaa	well just wear something nice and comfortable, it doesnt matter what you wear anyway nobody would mind so don't worry about it, by the way good luck on your first flight , i just love airplane rides, but it starts getting boring after an hour|`|IBl3kwYzaa	I found that it is good to wear jeans.. especially as you are taking a pair with you.. that way it saves weight in your suitcase as they tend to be quite heavy.. Other than that wear trackies or combats and comfty shoes..

aOYfAHvUaa	What is your final destination in Mexico? Kidnaps are going down since the last year, federal police has stopped most of those, the precautions are simple, always use Taxi Cabs from the hotel, and fix a time to have them pick you up going in and out from the hotel you are staying at. Do not wear 'eyecatching' jewlery, that will keep the atention off from the badguys, if you have friends in Mexico it will be a good idea to call them so they can take you around, or at least they can tell you what neighborhoods you have to avoid. Is important to take suggestions from the manager of the hotel in case you have more questions in terms of security around the area. If you are staying for a considerable time in mexico, look for your consulate or embassy representative in that city fill out a form of temporary visit so that your local embassy will know you are around (they can give you suggestions as well).  I hope that this helps, feel free to ask if you need more details, I would like to give you my cellphone but I dont know if this is allowed here, in case you need help of course :) but I dont really know were you are staying in Mexico. I know all of this because I work for Pacifica in Ixtapa and I've been in customer services for americans and canadians for the last 7 years and this feelings are common, as soon as you get to Mexico the enviroment is relaxed and our people likes to help our fellow americans (at least I do for the past 7 years). Look forward for your visit Mi casa es su casa! Bienvenido!|`|AA10818931	Dont stay in Juarez there are a lot of murders going on now so I reccomend you skip it!!|`|EohyO58baa	hi I live in Mexico and I have never been in El paso Juarez, or Chihuahua I know that it is a little dangerous, especially if you are alone but if you are all the time with somebody and take taxi there will be no problem. have you think in another option? there are a lot of option in Mexico. what I can tell you I love it!!
uFmgPbCYaa	I'm not so sure how much it would cost.... just make sure you bring enough euros to get you to your destination from the airport. maybe 100 euros just to be safe.<br>  <br>  and i'm pretty sure that there will be plenty of taxis waiting around that you wouldn't need to book one.

xhmcorwLaa	di solito durante lo scalo nn devi fare niente...dovrebbe occuparsi la compagnia aerea dei tuoi bagagli ^_^<br>  appena scesa puoi metterti o a riposare se 6 stanca o, come faccio io, andare a vedere i negozietti dell'aeroporto<br>  poi vai a cercare il tuo nuovo volo (con 1 po' di anticipo!!)...e lo prendi...<br>  buon viaggio e auguri!!|`|779ea60237ad8e5b42e6becc95b7bc35aa	per i bagagli ci pensano loro , tu dovrai solo attendere che annuncino il tuo volo .|`|AzPZWaVEaa	ha ragione usa26585. io avevo fatto scalo a new york per andare a san diego e ho dovuto ritirare il bagaglio e portarlo al nuovo imbarco (non devi rifare il check in, vicino a dove ritiri il bagaglio c'e` 1 postazione simile a quella del check in dove devi portare la valigia). se fai scalo in un aeroporto americano non so se 2 ore ti bastano perche` devi passare per il controllo passaporti e la coda e` molto lunga visto che ti prendono le impronte e ti fanno varie domande.|`|aan4rX8haa	No no i bagagli li prendi direttamente quando arrivi negli Stati Uniti! Tu scendi dall'aereo, e vai a cercarti il gate dell altro (presumo che dovrai fare scalo in un aeroporto di una qualche città europea, quindi dovrai prenderti una navetta e andare in un altra ala dell aeroporto per i voli intercontinentali). Spero che non devi fare scalo all'aeroporto di parigi, perchè è un incubo e spostano continuamente il gate dell aereo, facendoti girare dappertutto (io c ho fatto lo scalo per andare proprio negli Stati Uniti). Comunque.. Buon viaggio ^^|`|GKKpXamhaa	Dipende da dove fai lo scalo.....<br>  Se vai con una compagnia europea tipo lufthansa o british airways farai scalo a Londra o Francoforte. in questo caso non ti devi preoccupare di niente perche al momento del check-in inviano direttamente il bagaglio alla destinazione finale. Cosi quando arrivi all'aeroporto intermedio, devi seguire il cartello "flight connection" e andare direttamente al gate per la destinazione finale.<br>  Piu complicato invece se lo scalo lo fai in un aeroporto statunitense. in questo caso quando arrivi all'aeroporto intermedio devi andare a ritirare la tua valigia al "bagage claim" che si trova dopo i controlli e la devi riconsegnare subito dopo senza rifare il check-in.<br>  Se dovessi fare scalo in un aeroporto americano ricordati di andare a ritirare la valigia anche se in italia  ti hanno dato tutte e due le carte d'imbarco perche se no loro nn la mettono  sul secondo aereo.|`|w4j6UryXaa	Ti consiglio di dire subito al primo volo dello scalo così loro ti indirizzano i bagagli direttamente nell'altro aereo e tu non devi fare niente perchè fanno tutto loro. Altrimenti dovrai imbarcarli di nuovo!|`|c7BJoQBIaa	uno scalo di 2 ore?!?!??! credo proprio che troverai qualcuno col cartello a cercarti all'uscita...altrimenti vai verso la zona transito e cerca la nuova uscita col numero di volo ke avrai sulla carta...difficilmente dovrai rifare il check-in...x quello in america ti ci voglion 2 ore piene tra controlli e impicci....|`|0a5161fbce0ce37ea2d5473b48111e6eaa	Se voli con la stessa compagnia non devi ritirare i bagagli e per due ore cazzeggi in aeroporto aspettando l'ora di imbarco.<br>  Se invece voli con due compagnie diverse, allora nell'aeroporto di scalo devi ritirare i bagagli andare nell'area partenze e rifare tutta la trafila del check-in per l'altro volo. (ergo devi fare veloce appena scendi dall'aereo).
aFkSn7xIaa	You need a tourist visa.<br>  <br>  Look on the web site for the US embassy in London (or maybe the consulate nearest you if you're not near London).  You will probably need a round trip plane ticket and a few other bits of information before you go, but the details will be on the embassy web site.|`|74620b80bc4458d21d6ac3d673b41f8caa	Go here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/types_1286.html" rel="nofollow">http://travel.state.gov/visa/temp/types/...</a><br>  <br>  you should be able to find al the answers you need. You will have to go to an American embassy in the UK (they are usually in the telephone book, or you can find them online). Plan ahead it takes 3-6 months to get an American visa just for tourists.
ltI9cRKfaa	I should take a visit to the Isle of Bute in Scotland. It is staggeringly beautiful and no development for a hundred years except some harbour works for the ferry. The lanes are empty, the waters calm;   deer, hares, geese, seals, goats roam over the open land and little fields of cows and sheep. Over 100 species of birds. Great for walking, biking, horse-riding, exploring 3,000 year old sites and Standing Stones, golf, swimming, sailing, fishing for pike etc. See the other side of Europe and forget the McDonald's and tourist traps. Go to:-- <a href="http://del.icio.us/RogerMortimer" rel="nofollow">http://del.icio.us/RogerMortimer</a>  for a load of independent reviews, articles and travel directions/|`|AA10727591	The UK is a nice place, it's just if you live here your whole life you can forget all the nice bits about it.<br>  <br>  Of course we are slightly Americanised as we have McDonalds, Starbucks etc but we also have a beautiful countryside and many nice cities.<br>  Go to London, Edinburgh etc but also try and get out to the countryside, head over to Cornwall and go to some of the seaside towns there like St. Ives or Penzance, far from your average American town I am sure.<br>  <br>  As for offending and embarrassing yourself or other people you can't do much wrong as you can do much the same as you can in the US.

BpnNjCHVaa	There are several ships that cruise out of Los Angeles (San Pedro Harbor) and out of San Diego.  The Mexican Riviera and Catalina island are both good and vary in cost and days.  Carnival Cruise Lines has always been known as the "party" cruises, but lately they are trying to get away from that image on some of their cruises. Princess also is a good line.  All of the cruise lines have a certain amount of partying going on and they also have sail-away parties after each port-of-call.  Every cruise line takes all ages, but you will need to check if an adult needs to be present.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	June and July are the best time of year to cruise around the Greek Isles & Turkey. The chances are minimal that you will encounter any rough seas at all, your biggest worry will be finding somewhere to keep cool. The temperatures at that time of year in that area can be very high.|`|aIyvWIJlaa	June is usually pretty settled in that area; you'd be unlucky to get seas rough enough to worry you on a large cruise ship.|`|BpnNjCHVaa	I have never been to Greece, so cannot answer that part, but as for motion sickness - I used to get terribly sick and really worried about cruising.  But I now use "sea bands" that are an elastic type band around the wrist that use acupressure on the nerves to calm the stomach.  Also take Meclizine, which is a motion sick tablet that does not make you as drowsy or have the after effects that most of the other pills do. You get those at the drug store very reasonably priced and no prescription.|`|8264020a54b94a7b4d9ec51129b90d36aa	see the section on Motionsickness in this article(from Howstuffworks.com<br>  What About Seasickness?<br>  <br>  This is one of those questions that you, as an individual, have to consider. A clue that you might be prone to seasickness is that you become nauseated in a car or airplane or sailboat. If you're concerned that seasickness might be a problem for you, check out your itinerary, looking closely at geographic factors that could influence the motion of the ocean. (Some spots are known to be a little rougher, like the cruise through the Strait of Magellan and that stretch of ocean between Manila in the Philippines and Hong Kong.) However, that doesn't account for those unforeseen occasions when the ship passes through a storm and becomes a little rocky for walking and dancing. Here are a few anti-nausea aids and old sailor's cures:<br>  <br>  The old stand-by antihistamines, such as Dramamine and Bonine. These tend to make you drowsy but are better than the alternative. The key is to take the tablets BEFORE you're seasick! Once the nausea hits, they don't do much good. (Most ships offer free tablets at the reception desk.)<br>  Some cruisers swear by the gray, stretchy wrist bands, made by SeaBand or TravelGarde. These place nodes at acupuncture points to relieve the symptoms of nausea. Some people are very successful with them; others say they get no benefits. (It'd be nice if they'd make these things in fashion colors!)<br>  Also not pretty are the round cardboard ear patches, which were for several years removed from the U.S. market. The patches generally contain about 1.5 mg. of scopolomine, which reportedly reduces nausea by suppressing a reflex that minimizes the distance between input perceived by the inner ear and visual input. Each patch, worn behind the ear, lasts about three days. Side effects include blurred vision and headaches. Consult with your doctor, since these are by prescription only in the United States.<br>  Some of the "folk" and nontraditional cures even work. Ginger root, which can be bought in any drug store or health and vitamin store, is a popular treatment. And one ship captain's cure-all: eat crackers, which are salty, and apple slices, which are acidic, and the combination acts as a calming agent in your gut. He also says to avoid your natural inclination to drink soda or ginger ale when you're nauseated. "It's just more in there to slosh around," he grinned.<br>  Everybody knows it's folly to stare at those big waves! Look at the horizon instead, experts say.<br>  If all else fails, you can always visit the ship's doctor for a super-duper antihistamine injection that works more quickly and effectively than a pill. You'll have to pay the doctor and you'll probably sleep for a day or so, but if you've ever been seasick, you know that it's worth it!<br>  <br>  also call your cruiseline and ask them what they suggest.<br>  <br>  i Have used bonine medication(over the counter) and been fine.<br>  best wishes to you<br>  cruisecritic.com|`|JYWFeDJMaa	there are stabolisers built into the boat anyway so that nobody feels anything! if you do feel sea sick there are doctors and medicines on board!|`|WaI693jHaa	It really depends on the weather.

5ZtSR0IQaa	It's not a bad idea to go to Japan during high school for a year on an exchange program. That's the longest advisable and possible anyway.<br>  <br>  The longest student visa you can get for high school is for one year. If you haven't been enrolled in a Japanese school for at least a year before, they won't issue it to you as an individual. You need to be in an exchange program otherwise.<br>  <br>  Also, if you somehow manage to graduate from a Japanese high school, you will be required to take the same university entrance exam as a native Japanese and not the much easier foreign student exam. You will likely fail in the Japanese language and history subjects.<br>  <br>  The much more realistic move to Japan starts with college. You have to take the standardized exam administered by JASSO (Japan Student Services Organization) as part of your application process to any Japanese college. JASSO's exam (called EJU) includes a Japanese language test, so it means you need to study Japanese pretty intensively. Passing EJU's Japanese language subject is equivalent to passing Level 2 on the Japanese Language Proficiency Test, which is a tough milestone to reach for anyone serious about learning Japanese.<br>  <br>  So suppose you got decent scores on the EJU and are good to apply for a Japanese college. In order to move to Japan, you need a work visa. You need a college degree to get a work visa in most of the work visa categories. (An associates degree from a junior college is actually a valid qualification but not an advisable choice for the general job market.) Your job needs to be directly related to your college major in order to qualify for the work visa. It all means that you have to choose your major very carefully when you're starting college. Also, you're not allowed to have a gap year between college and joining the work force like a native student, because your student visa expires when you graduate. You need be able to switch to a work visa immediately when you graduate.<br>  <br>  So the best advice for right now is that if you have the budget to pay for your own apartment in Japan, save it for your future college career in Japan, or even better, use it to learn Japanese like you're going to pass Level 1 on the JLPT before you're done with high school. You could always use that money for a high school exchange program to Japan, but that doesn't get you any closer to Japanese college academically.<br>  <br>  1. You can be any age to move to Japan as a family dependent. College is the realistic minimum age to move there on your own.<br>  <br>  2. A student visa is no problem if you get accepted to a Japanese college. A work visa after college is a much tougher proposition. You need a work visa to live in Japan, at least for 10 years. After 10 years, you can get Japanese permanent residency, and you're free to become a bum or take any job that you couldn't previously hold with a work visa.<br>  <br>  3. As high school is not compulsory in Japan, there is tuition. A public high school might have an enrollment fee of $50 and an annual tuition of $1200. You still need to spend more money on books, uniforms, and commuting.<br>  <br>  4. Even a $700 apartment might be too much luxury for a student on a budget. JASSO estimates a college student's living expense in Japan at $1300 a month, with rent at $300. You won't get the same kind of amenities as a $700 apartment, but you don't start your student living with the same kind of live as someone with a full time job to pay for it all on their own. This would be the same if you moved out of your home for college in your home country anyway.<br>  <br>  You pretty much need a college degree to get a work visa, so college has to be a part of your life plan.<br>  <br>  It is possible to get a work visa without a college degree. You could become a religious missionary or an artist. As an artist, you need to prove first that you sell enough art to make a living (at least $50k/yr). You'd need to be ordained as a missionary. So neither is any easier.|`|5b37795563969b19352fc16bf286b0a0aa	You can't move to Japan, obviously you are still in high school and without income you can't survive.  You can't get a job there unless you speak native Japanese or native-like Japanese.

We impressed our friends from NYC with a walk through.
PA0bGBtCaa	When I was in Europe for vacation I took Easy Jet from London to Spain. It was okay. The fare was cheap compared to the other carriers flying the route and I arrived on time. I mean it wasn't the greatest airline experience ever, but for what I paid for my ticket, I can't complain. You have to fly on the carrier that gives you the best flexibility and cheapest fares! Plus EasyJet has a nice young Airbus fleet.|`|2pmsCdLMaa	Just flew to Hamburg and back with Easyjet.  The plane (there and back) arrived well before it was due.  The staff were friendly enough.  However there was NO legroom at all - I felt a bit claustrophobic to be honest.  But other than that it was fine for a short flight.|`|PC6SC6jyaa	I frequently fly with Ryanair and Easyjet. <br>  <br>  Ryanair (no matter what the media says) beats Easyjet every time. <br>  <br>  Ryanair are always cheaper, on-time, better aircraft and staff, more comfortable,plus no hassle!<br>  <br>  Easyjet often is late, delays, no legroom ,poor and rude staff and service - and not worth the price. I know Easyjet can be seen like a cheaper BA - but it shows. <br>  <br>  It depends on where you're going; but if you could I would go with Ryanair. <br>  <br>  I never use travel/tour agents. I book my Ryanair flights, add a hotel - and sometimes a car. In 11 years of Ryanair; only one delay, one landing which was "hard" (completely safe; just not comfortable) and no other problems! <br>  <br>  Go with Ryanair.|`|2a2c77fb9c2d023a12350d7ccc0f54d4aa	Been on Easyjet about a dozen times and have never been delayed due to technical problems. The only delay was for snow in Estonia. The staff are freindly and down to earth. On a trip back from Spain the chief stewardess decided to sing a song about the duty free supplies they had on board much to the amusment of the passengers. Overall we have had no problems.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	Haven't used them for holidays, but I've flown with them a few times and have had no problems. It's truly a no-frills service, but if you're only going to be in the air for 1-3 hours you don't really need luxuries.|`|zjZA4sAZaa	Its worth the money, but very hard seats and not great survice.|`|OrtZmQ4Saa	We prefer to use Easyjet when we can .

2Fi3EmI8aa	yeah we have all that stuff to do here.  The reason people say Canberra is boring is becuase there is very little to do spontaneously.  Like if your sitting on your **** on a Friday night and looking for something to do, then no - you probably wont find anything.  But if you organise with your friends to go to the pub, movies, or out clubbing, then that will work out better for you.  The only real issue is the Canberra can be a little insular, but once you've found a group of friends - you'll be right and there will always be something to do.|`|a9C6ZYPqaa	Seriously?

AA11948690	Logan Square and Boystown isn't "cheap". The rent is skyrocketing in both areas; that is, when you can find a rental. Most places are turning condo. For cheap, try places like Edgewater, Andersonville, Buena Park, parts of Ravenswood where you can still find a studio or one bedroom for anywhere from $650 to 900.<br>  <br>  but even if you don't choose those places, you can still live cheaply. For starters, shop at the smaller neighborhood groceries. Skip the big chains like Jewel or Dominicks or especialy Whole Foods or Trader Joe's if you can't afford it. Instead scout out the neighborhood stores. For instance, in my neighborhood, Dominicks' sells boneless chicken breasts for about $6 bucks for two. There is another non-chair store (Devon Market) where you can get a pack of about five chicken breasts for $5-plus, and the quality is the same is not better. <br>  <br>  For clothing, don't shop at the trendy shops like Urban Outfitters, A&F, etc. Stick with the stores like Marshalls, TJ Maxx, etc. I recently found a pair of designer dress slacks for $20. Original price?: $60. And occasionally go to resale shops and find great stuff (but you have to be careful: some resale shops are cleaner and neater than others).<br>  <br>  If you don't really need a computer in your place for actual work and just need it to surf the net a bit or check email, consider signing up for an internet cafe like Screenz. They give you a car that you fill with money and you use that to sign onto their computers. When your card runs out, just fill it up again. You can also print out things there too, and they have a business section of computers with programs like Word, Excel, etc. if you need those. It's a hell of a lot cheaper than buying a computer and paying a monthly internet bill.<br>  <br>  despite what some people think you can live cheaply here. Just learn to pull away from the crowd heading to Whole Foods and find your own bargains.|`|rbanG8FRaa	Logan Square: depends upon where you live. It is a neighborhood in change. Some streets are great while others aren't. Look for a place to live in person. While there look at other houses on the street and the cars parked on the street. |`|AA10065077	Be aware of the reasons that these places are cheaper to live. Crime rates, places are small etc.

Rain IS possible, but so  is a volcano sprouting up in the middle of Wilshire Blvd. I'm just saying it is possible, but not likely at all.<br>  <br>  3. It's about 11 miles to the Beverly Hillton, and can take anywhere from 30-60 minutes, depending on traffic.<br>  <br>  4. Alamo is fine. My personal preference is Enterprise, but if you have  good deal from Alamo, take it. <br>  <br>  If you have a convertible, take a drive up highway 1, just for fun.

Also, go to third st. promenade, and farmer's market. If you want to check out a concert, go to ticket master and find out who's performing and where. <br>  2. It's ok to rent a conv. just close the top when it rains, but in April we don't get that many thunder storms just a few light showers. <br>  3. Depends on traffic, but on an average about a good twenty or thirty minutes. LAX is always busy, and you will have to go through allot of cars just to get out. <br>  <br>  1. You can change where you eat, LA has allot of exotic places to eat and dance. Just look it up online.

I would consider Puerto Rico but I would never consider the Virgin Islands.  I've been to the St. Croix  too much crime there, St. Thomas is too commercial it is like a city with nothing to do except buy gold. St. Johns is just a little too isolated.  I loved a suburban area of San Fransisco, the weather was wonderful, sunny and warm during the day and nice and cool at night. Here in Florida it gets too hot and the humidity you always feel sticky. I would also consider Sheridan, Wyoming. I love old towns and Sheridan is not too big not too small and isolated like most parts of Wyoming.

tcmaLqWFaa	It's always better to be yourself.  And, it is totally different than in U.S. Filipinas are not the dominating task-masters that American women are.  Filipinas assume a more traditional role in him/her relationships.  That's not oppressive or backwards.  It's just the natural order of things.  Most men (who have not been castrated by fem-bots in America) prefer Filipinas over any other group.  Most are cute, smart, perfect physical specimens, and are proud to serve their husband or bf in a very loyal manner.  They don't see that as a weakness like white girls do.  Unless you make your selection from a bar, you will likely be pleased with what you find here.  Be prepared for their shy, reserved nature and proper behavior.  Not all have what they consider good English skills so, be careful not to misread their self-conscious in verbal skills with disinterest.  If you speak first, 9 out of ten will be happy about it.

You can also ask the people behind the counter for recommendations.  I have listed a place or two in the sources you can try (Smokeys).  Smokeys is a real tourist trap though and the stuff there is alright, but not great.  The good thing is this palce is located close by to at least 10-12 other very decent coffee shops like the Bulldog (few of these Brit style) or the Bushdoctor (excellent) which is located right on the Amstel canal about 4-5 minutes walk from Smokeys.<br>  <br>  Only buy in coffee shops and never buy anything on the street.|`|lwKz0iDJaa	Yeah u just go into the coffee shop and i dont know about the seeds, sorry.<br>  Gotta love amsterdam :D|`|dqw1iH6haa	its everywhere|`|z3g6G4cTaa	ideekayy|`|XSUtjniPaa	you walk around amsterdam and look for shops that have the leaf on them, and im pretty sure you cant buy seeds|`|cwaBy1SYaa	Sounds like the second hand smoke alone would be enough!|`|lQmGDPIoaa	Have fun killing your brain cells...

PA0bGBtCaa	You can play this two ways. First would be to figure out how long you are staying in St. Maarten. If you will be there for less than three months, then you will have to purchase proof of onward travel. That simply means that you are either buying a return ticket, or you are buying a ticket to another country on another airline. Yes, your firend is correct. If you don't have that proof of onward travel, then you will get sent back to the US.<br>  <br>  If you are staying longer than three months, then you need to get a VISA from the State Department. I've pased below the requirements for visiting St. Maarten below. It has all the general passport requirements you will need:<br>  <br>  <br>  Passport required.<br>  - Passport and/or passport replacing documents must be valid<br>    throughout the period of intended stay. <br>   - Expired passport (max. 5 years) issued to nationals of the<br>     U.S.A. are accepted.<br>  - Warning: if departing from the U.S.A.(regardless of any<br>    destination passport exemptions), a valid passport and/or<br>    accepted departure document (TIRULES/R9) is required by<br>    the U.S. immigration authorities.<br>  Passport Exemptions:<br>  - Holders of a Naturalization Certificate of American<br>    Citizenship with raised seal and accompanied by a government<br>    issued (eg. driver's licence) photo ID, issued to nationals<br>    of the U.S.A., born outside of the U.S.A.. <br>  - Nationals of the U.S.A. (born in the U.S.A.) holding an<br>    original Birth Certificate (or affidavit), which must be<br>    accompanied by a government issued photo ID (i.e. driver's<br>    licence). <br>  <br>  Visa required, except for A stay not exceeding 3 months, for<br>  nationals of U.S.A..<br>  Minors:<br>  - Must be escorted or met by an adult residing in the<br>    Netherlands Antilles upon arrival. <br>  Additional Information:<br>  - For travel within the Netherlands Antilles all passengers<br>    (incl. residents) of 14 years and older must hold proof of<br>    identity, if possible with photo.<br>  - All visitors must hold sufficient means of support ,<br>    return/onward ticket to a destination outside of the<br>    Netherlands Antilles and all documents required for that<br>    journey;<br>  Warning:<br>  - Non-compliance with entry regulations will result in<br>    deportation of passenger and fines for the carriers.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Vaccination against Yellow Fever, is required if arriving<br>  within 6 days after leaving or transiting countries with<br>  infected areas.<br>  <br>  Exempt from Yellow Fever vaccination:<br>  - Children under 6 months of age. <br>  - Transit passengers not leaving the airport.<br>  - Those not leaving the airport in the yellow fever infected<br>    countries.<br>  <br>  Before you even get there, I would recommend knowing in advance how long you will be there. If you purchase that proof of onward travel, then you can purchase it now and save money on the air fare as it will probably be a little bit cheaper.

You will not have to go thru security again unless you leave the "secured" area.

If you are transferring planes, then just check your boarding passes (which will be given to you in Flint) to determine which gate you will need to be headed to. If you have enough time you can use the bathroom and get some food/magazines/whatever. Then just hang out in the seats around the gate until they call you to board. When you board they will need to scan your boarding pass that says you are traveling from Milwaukee to Madison. The airline will take care of transferring your luggage under the plane, so you will not need to worry about that.

There is a great selection of hotels, from the Melia to the RIU chains.  The area is accessible, therefore you are able to see a little of the Country away from the beach, and it is the easiest area to be in, if considering a trip to Havana - which is really interesting.  Holguin area, does have good beaches, and nice hotels, but you are not perhaps seeing Cuba for the Country that it is...........|`|d2QVB6Qyaa	I agree you need to do some research. Varadero is  all inclusive resorts - but not really Cuba. You could be anywhere. Yes, the water is warm, just don't go in the hurricane season  - which is around when you are talking about.You won't be allowed to swim if they weather is really bad and the last few years they have had a lot of hurricanes.  <br>  <br>  Cuba is a great place  to visit...although personally I would prefer Havana, Trinidad, which is also very near nice beaches (about 8 kms) you could stay at one of those resorts and Vinales which is a little different.<br>  <br>  It depends what kind of holiday you are wanting. Just a beach somewhere warm, or an experience of a very different country.<br>  <br>  Have a look at <a href="http://www.fascinating-travel-destinations.com/information-on-cuba.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.fascinating-travel-destinatio...</a>|`|m1Kjxlkvaa	my son has just returned from playa pesquero on his honeymoon, they had a fantastic time,people friendly,the hotel great,lovely food, go on the dolphin tour, he says it is the best thing he has ever done, worth every penny, beautiful beach,not much to buy there, take plenty of toiletries and medicines as not easy to buy.remember to tip a few pesos as they don't earn much,and they appreciate it. they also change beds and towels every day, and make towels into beautiful animals.very relaxing, in february it was 30 degrees, sea alittle cool.but fine lovely pools at hotel|`|RhkKGsipaa	The water will be very warm, no problem at all.

You fly into Holguin and it is about an hour by comfortable bus to Guardalavaca where the resorts are located.  Luna y Mares is fantastic, a beautiful white sand powder beach, good dining, excellent friendly staff and lots to do that is included at no extra cost.
