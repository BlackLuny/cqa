qsqmykzsaa	recycling is easy as. We have been doing it for years.<br>  <br>  all cans, aluminium or steel go in the recycle bin.<br>  Plastic bottles, containers, I think they have a "pip" marked on them somewhere.<br>  Newspapers, cardboard, cereal boxes and the like.<br>  <br>  your kitchen rubbish is the only thing to go in the normal rubbish bin. you can even re-cycle that in to a compost bin. Grass clippings and all organic matter, like vegetable scraps can go to compost.<br>  <br>  We end up only having to put the bin out for collection about every 2 weeks.<br>  It has reached the point now where we dont have to think about it, we are so used to doing it.<br>  Good luck with going green.|`|5TKEtXERaa	If you go to the right places almost everything can be recycled, but depending on where you are at it will determine what you can take in. I would suggest going to the website below and entering your zip code and it will tell you where is near you and what they accept.|`|iBitNRZuaa	I've recycled for a number of years under more than one system.  I find that separating my recyclables into the categories/container types that I have to dump them in helps all the way.  I would start with the place you take to and what types of bins they use.  Then, I would consider how often you plan on and/or need to go to the recycling place.  <br>  <br>  Currently, I have a house, yard, and truck and as a result am able to collect whole garbage cans' worth of recyclable materials.  I do so for my #1 and #2 plastics: I line the can with a better plastic sack which aides in disposal.  While I transport in the can, I dump using the plastic sack and, my current plastic liner is well into its second year.  I find that I hardly get much for glass containers so, I use a medium trash can with three sacks in it; one for clear, green, and brown glass.  I gather my tin cans in a smaller garbage can also lined with a plastic sack.  From time to time, I have a larger load of tin cans and will slip the plastic liner into can I use for plastic bottles for transport; the plastics wait for a different trip.  In the house, I have an older and very large leaf and yard waste plastic bag over a home-made wood frame.  Across the top of a part of the wood frame, I have the single direction paper shredder.  Shreds from the double shredder as well as other "mixed paper" are poured into this sack along side the shredder until the sack is full.  When it is full, it is transported in the plastics' garbage can.  The mixed paper plastic sack has been in use for almost 5 years; when it wears out, I don't know what I'll do because I don't think I can find them as big any more.   Cardboard is flattened and stacked in a dry spot on the back poarch; it gets taken to recycle more often in the summer deck season than the winter!  Bits and pieces of metal are gathered in a 5 gallon bucket but, larger pieces and/or volumes are pretty much taken directly.  Yard waste is a frequent and common item that I load directly into the truck.  Typically, I load one type of other recycle for the trip when I'm taking yard waste. I have few aluminaum cans and those I do get, I save for someone who gathers them for extras in their budget.  - Going to the recycling center is only 1-3 miles one direction out of my way five days a week.<br>  <br>  When I had to "make a trip" to be able to recycle - Let me assure you, I had full garbage cans of each type of thing before I made the trip.  All of my yard waste was allowed to dry out and reduce in volume before I took it.  (Much of my transported yard waste is either branch or invasive weed in nature.)  With adequate rope, I could stack the cans two high and/or on top of a load of yard waste then add a layer of plastic sacks on top of the cans.<br>  <br>  Oh, in the house I have a can beside the garbage can that I put the outdoor recyclables (plastic, glass, tin); when it is full, I take it outside and distribute amoung the outdoor recyclable containters.  I take the cardboard out directly.  The mixed paper goes directly into the paper shredder bag.  And, I veggie pit my kitchen produce, eggshell, and use coffee ground scraps.  These get saved in a coffee can with lid on top and bottom.  When the can is full, the contents go into a hole in the garden or the composting area and are then covered.  <br>  <br>  Separating recyclables is sort of a personal organizational thing which is why there are few firm "rules".  Also, what "makes sense" depends upon what you may/can recycle, how your recycling center/system reqwuires things to be separated, how often you dump your containers, and your holding capacity.
0KmJwYunaa	There are limited locations that are suitable for a wind farm.   The wind should be constant, preferably during the day though most winds blow at night.   The location should be close to power transmission lines that still has excess capacity to take the power to market.   The location needs to be accessible by road to minimize installation and maintenance costs.   The land is probably already owned by someone so you have to somehow negotiate for the land without giving away any financial advantage to having the land.<br>  <br>  The bird strike problem is mostly a non-issue.   Studies have shown that when visibility is good, the birds are quite adept at avoiding being struck by the blades.   These blades are large structures that are very visible and don't move that fast.   During bad visibility situations which is where the strikes that do occur have occurred, birds tend to refrain from flying.<br>  <br>  Also, wind power is hardly on demand and there is always the chance that a wind farm won't have enough wind for power generation at any point in time so you have to have an equivalent amount of standby generation capacity that can be started on a as need basis.   To a certain extent, they can play the probabilities game and count on existing power plants not running at full capacity or being able to purchase power from neighbouring power grids that are on a different portion of the daily demand curve but essentially this means that only a relatively small percentage of our power use can come from wind, at least until we find a better way of storing power.|`|bfe4ad38e28ddda61b321173866c1f9aaa	Because you have to have sustainable winds above 6 mph to create this energy.  The plains states and around the coasts are the best places for wind energy.  It was suggested to put in wind turbines off of the Atlantic sea board but Democrats like Ted Kennedy shut this down because it would be an eye sore.  That is the biggest trouble, no one wants any type of energy producing plant or farm near them.  Also a lot of your environmentalists don't like the death of birds caused by wind farms so we are in a catch 22.|`|d6fd3077bc1506ef3c2bb76a580cdb53aa	Wind energy is NOT free.<br>  SOME types have considerable maintenance expense.<br>  <br>  MUCH of the land area does NOT have suitable wind patterns for wind farms to be economically feasible on a commercial scale.<br>  <br>  Many people do not like the looks and/or noise of the more common types in use.<br>  <br>  While the environmentalists CLAIM they kill birds, I have yet to see ANY substantiated proof of this.

Cutting down trees, or deforestation, will cause global warming increase at a faster rate.  <br>  <br>  We are against nature, because in the past, CO2 emissions became high over millions of years. We are causing CO2 emissions to heat up the earth in only a few hundred years, starting 200 years ago with the industrial revolution.<br>  <br>  As the earth heats up, oceans expand causing sea levels to rise, flooding coastal cities.  Storms and droughts will become more frequent in places they were nonexistent.<br>  <br>  Other effects include entire ecosystems (tropical rain forests, grasslands, coral reefs, etc) would collapse. We need these ecosystems to get all the resources we use, like paper, and food.<br>  <br>  Agriculturally productive farmland will become dry and we would no longer be able to get food.

The world has died because of too many plant like things and no animals long long long ago (this was in a museum). The air ran out of carbon dioxide. <br>  <br>  So the world is seeking for balance between oxygen and carbon dioxide. If we fail to achieve this balance we will die (isn't that reason enough to worry?). Yet, all things seek homeostasis.  If you are into evolution, another species (plants vs animals, or as I say oxygen vs carbon dioxide) will raise and fail until a species is smart enough to regulate the problem... better.<br>  <br>  If they do not find a way the process will repeat itself over and over. Or maybe the earth is changing so much that it will become more like Venus or Mars. The homeostasis of the universe might not include earth.|`|DqmMW2tcaa	There are so many reasons. The earth has finite resources and these resources are often exploited for short term profit gain while the natural areas that were destroyed in order to mine the resource are lost forever. One of the last wilderness areas in the world, the Kimberly in Western Australia could be a wilderness area no more if a plan to build a natural gas plant in the area goes ahead. Gas companies will come and go but the Kimberly will always be there.<br>  <br>  The whole world is one big ecosytem, so destroying one part of it will have an impact on another part. For example the extinction of a bird which eats mosquitoes could result in an increase in malaria.  So we are effected as well if nature is destroyed. We need trees to convert Co2 into oxygen.<br>  <br>  Many wildlife need certain habitats in order to survive and will or have become extinct if their habitats are destroyed. So protecting natural areas helps maintain the biodiversity of plants and animals. There is a certain tree in India which has not germinated in 300 years. It is thought that the seeds of this tree needed to be ingested by the dodo which has been extinct  from approximately the same time this tree stopped flowering.

What I simply cannot understand is why so many of the world's citizens are falling for this criminal scam.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, the Warmers voices are becoming even more shrill as they frantically claw, beg and grovel for more billions of $$$ in this bad economy of ours.  <br>  <br>  Hansen & Co. are an embarrassment to science and will eventually be brought to justice once the masses become fed up with the wanton waste of Trillions of $$$ brought on by their lies and perversion of so-called 'science'.|`|KOecCLjLaa	you have ice floating in salt water... of course its going to melt far faster than anyone has predicted.. the less ice, the more salt gets onto the remainder of the ice... and the increase melt... keep in mind that when you have a large amount of ice melting it melts fresh water and that fresh water keeps high concentrated salt water further away|`|f0bb213732f5c2ceb3db8c6b3def0573aa	Yes<br>  <br>  Can you imagine all the university funding lost if the research identified that global warming was considered null or if there was no man-made influence identified?|`|whIF5blFaa	When I began my career as an engineer if you misrepresented your results, manipulated your data or did not honestly quantify your experimental error you were labeled a fraud and shunned by the scientific community. There was no readmission into the realm of legitimate scientific discord. <br>  All citizens reaped the benefits of this ethics system and the field in which I work (aviation) advanced itself with breakthroughs that are unparalleled even today in their impact on everyday life. 100 years ago we traveled airborne at speeds below 100 mph for maximum distances that could be measured in feet. Today we travel at speeds and levels of safety and comfort that were incomprehensible only a generation ago. This progress is a direct result of discipline and adherence to the scientific process. We learned in the early days of aviation that design based on  consensus was dangerous and the result was often tragic loss of life.By sticking close to these ethics, countless others benefited outside aviation. Composites became better understood and more widely applied in everyday life, medicine benefited from research that could be carried out in the vacuum of space. All things mechanical became more efficient as aerospace technology advanced better bearing technology. Computer applications designed to evaluate structures and aerodynamic qualities rapidly advanced and became mainstream in the design of non-aerospace everyday products. In short, we all are better off because real, ethical scientists and engineers did not relent to the populist push when their research and observations contradicted the popular view.<br>  Now we are confronted with a different view and a group that believes that research is only legitimate if it supports a predetermined position. Effectively, this approach burns every classical science and engineering text in the classroom. This group can't even live by the most basic scientific convention, that is found in the preface of most science texts.  I am refering to the law of significant figures, which states in laymans terms, that it is scientifically improper to state your results and conclusions as having a greater level of certainty than the error in your data. Today the populists believe that saving the planet is paramount, but their premise is not scientific fact and the method to achieve their goal is not based on the scientific process. Ultimately we will most likely find that the price of their misguided pursuit will result in unintended consequences. We are already burning food instead of feeding starving people with it, and we are also turning a blind eye to the problems to be caused by growing food to burn. It is a scientific fact that no other commercial crop depletes the soil of its nutrients or causes more soil run off that corn. Yet in our blind rush to make an immeasurable dent in air quality and temperature, many choose to ignore those hard scientific facts while they cling to fake beliefs.|`|t1zlbOURaa	I see them constantly massaging all of the data to fit their conclusions. That's whether it's ice data, temperature data, trend data, CO2 data, wind power efficiency data, electrical grid data, etc.<br>  <br>  Since the late 1960's I remember them trying to scare us: "everyone will die of starvation before 1980", with global cooling, global warming, ozone holes, etc. Each time they have been wrong, and somehow people still treat them with respect and deference.<br>  <br>  I'm now at the point where anyone of this ilk must be doubted, and assumed to be if not lying, of bending or fogging the truth to fit their political goals. It took me a long time to get here, I like to give people the benefit of the doubt, but I now must assume that they are lying first, and wait for the proof.<br>  <br>  The recent missing ice was the last straw for me. <br>  <br>  Just prior to that, if an ice flow the 10 miles long and two wide broke off of an ice shelf, it would lead to all kinds of public handwringing, and talk of doom even though it's a normal occurance. They lost a California sized chunk of ice, and barely said a word. They should have been enormously apologetic for making a mistake of this magnitude, but instead blamed "deniers" for making a big deal of it.<br>  <br>  I trust scientists.

Our climate has "changed" up and down tens of thousands of time.  It has been warmer than it is now, and cooler.  And there is not a shred of proof that our warming trend ( up .22 degrees F since 1990....WOW!!!) is man-made.  Legitimate scientists all over the world have been, and are still dismissing this alamist GW baloney.  Another scam on the way out.........

I remember there were some assertions that I felt were manipulations, and not discussed factually. It has been a few years since, so I would have to read it again to find them.<br>  But he has not been a good role-model for leaving a small carbon foot-print on the environment. Perhaps when you have so many speaking engagements, it is hard to avoid flying so much. Perhaps it is hard not using so much energy on his sprawling home. It does not matter how the energy is produced. That he thinks it is OK to use a huge amount is NOT OK.<br>  Yes CO2 impacts the environment, but man is only accelerating a natural process by cutting down trees and building for an ever increasing world population.<br>  My greater concern is using what were forests for raising grazing animals instead of building multi-level buildings to farm in (using solar and wind-turbines to produce the electricity needed to grow produce in the buildings). This would take up less space, allow areas that now have no practical use, and allow production year round while minimizing plant disease, and insect infestations. Additionally, the plants would require less water, and be immune to natural disasters, unlike outdoor farming.<br>  Another concern is that industry still pollutes our land and waterways.<br>  Additionally, we are being lied to about building large solar and wind generated electrical farms. Pollution will still exist from them, as the transmission line's equipment pollutes the environment.<br>  It would be far better if solar panels and wind turbines were placed on homes and buildings. Then the transmission line's would be lessened, and the effects of nature would be less (no worry about complete power loss during a storm).<br>  Championing Al Gore is foolish.|`|ESj0Ch56aa	They are just idiots that's why there is global warming and child abuse and animal cruelty because they don't listen and don't care!! the idiots that is, and there is a lot of them!|`|hf27zNgdaa	Haw Haw.

5tpV7Jdcaa	The Oceans will rise 20meters  but Carrauntoohil and other regions will be OK.  Dont live on the coast.  It will be clear ina few years!!!|`|3uiIrxojaa	in 49 years from now the ocean is gonna overflow proved by scientists|`|aiyU3Qf9aa	Move there.<br>  Buy a home on a hill, not the beach.<br>  Learn to drink stout.<br>  Enjoy!|`|uOErNlPNaa	N<br>  E<br>  H<br>  .<br>  <br>  neh.|`|fERs7TzVaa	It's unlikely that the island will be covered by water. Torrential rainfalls might make flooding on rivers commonplace, though. <br>  Overall, I think Ireland is a safe place to live, and will continue to be even if global warming reaches worst-case-scenario-levels.|`|t1zlbOURaa	Yeah, it will be flowed. Really flowed bad too.|`|TQOVizbsaa	I still haven't seen people in the coastal areas of USA buying diving suits nor boats. And the shores look exactly alike after so many decades. Relax: the ocean will not increase in the next decades. Too much scare tactics and balonies. Not that there is no "global warming" [this Winter I found it too cold], but too much exaggerations from some people. Visit Ireland anyway. Damn!<br>  P.D.: I am more afraid of a mugger than "global warming".
UNfB8FW8aa	Look up Algae or "cyanobacteria". there's a lot happening with it. It's fixes far more carbon that trees, and there's oceans full of the stuff.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory.cfm/newsid/48749/story.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.planetark.org/dailynewsstory....</a>|`|hf27zNgdaa	Whales!  ooops Whale Trees!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Save the Whales!|`|npBCankMaa	the waters of the oceans hold even more.  CO2 disovles in water at high concentrations, just like you soda pop does.
yP9qx2f9aa	Rachel Carson informed the world about the dangers of DDT|`|uWY5maD1aa	Sarah Palin. She looks good inside or out.|`|MBFeHS22aa	Hillary Clinton. All of her hot air has produced global warming!|`|hf27zNgdaa	LOL Hillary Clinton!  She's a lawyer.  And Rachel Carson was a stripper before she became a book writer.<br>  <br>  I googled it and you know what.  THEY ARE ALL MEN.  There are no women environmental scientists.
