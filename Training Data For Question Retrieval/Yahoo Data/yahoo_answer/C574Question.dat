20080102072238AA0eIoc	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Sabias que...?	?Duerme mal? Cuidado con la diabetes         Problemas crónicos de sue?o tienen graves repercusiones en la salud independientemente de la edad.    Una noche de sue?o interrumpido podría incrementar el riesgo de desarrollar diabetes, según reveló un nuevo estudio.    Un equipo de especialistas de Estados Unidos descubrió que los voluntarios que participaron en el estudio y a quienes se les despertó cuando iban a iniciar una sesión de sue?o profundo desarrollaron resistencia a la insulina.       La incapacidad del cuerpo para reconocer se?ales normales de insulina conduce a altos niveles de azúcar en la sangre, sobrepeso y, eventualmente, a diabetes del tipo dos.       El estudio fue publicado en la revista especializada Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences de Estados Unidos.       Investigaciones previas habían mostrado una relación entre la diabetes y la escasez de sue?o.

Tanto los terremotos como los ataques epilépticos se inician con peque?ísimos temblores difícilmente perceptibles.            Y hay tantas similitudes entre ambos eventos que en la sismología podría estar la clave para ayudar a predecir y prevenir ataques epilépticos.       Según científicos en Estados Unidos el trastorno neurológico que provoca una crisis epiléptica refleja lo que ocurre cuando la corteza terrestre se sacude en un terremoto.          El equipo de neurólogos de la Universidad de Kansas comparó la actividad cerebral en 16.000 ataques epilépticos con los datos sismológicos de 300.000 terremotos.       "Descubrimos que hay una gran semejanza entre las crisis epilépticas y los terremotos" dijo a BBC Ciencia el profesor Iván Osorio, director del Centro de Epilepsia de la Universidad de Kansas, quien dirigió la investigación.       "El hecho importante desde el punto de vista científico es que sistemas tan distintos como la corteza terrestre y la corteza cerebral tienen semejanzas dinámicas fundamentales", afirma el investigador.
20080116084058AARYwVZ	Health;Other - Health	Colón "llevó la sífilis a Europa"...informe?	Durante siglos hay científicos o historiadores que creían que junto con el idioma y la religión, los descubridores de América llevaron también la sífilis al Nuevo Mundo.        La sífilis es causada por el Treponema pallidum, una bacteria de forma espiral (espiroqueta)     Ahora un estudio científico publicado en PLoS, la revista de la Biblioteca Pública de Ciencias de Enfermedades Tropicales Olvidadas, de Estados Unidos, busca ofrecer nuevas luces sobre este contencioso tema.       La bacteria que causa esta enfermedad, dicen los autores, ya existía en el nuevo continente y de allí fue llevada a Europa.          La primera epidemia registrada de sífilis ocurrió en Europa en 1495, dos a?os después de que Cristóbal Colón regresara de su primer viaje a través del Atlántico.       Por eso ya se había especulado que esta enfermedad sexualmente transmitida pudo haberse originado en América.       Pero ahora investigadores estadounidense afirman que tienen evidencia que pondrá fin al largo debate de quién contagió a quién.       La respuesta es que Colón y sus navegantes introdujeron el patógeno de la sífilis en la Europa del Renacimiento después de contagiarse con la bacteria durante sus viajes al Nuevo Mundo.          Todavía no se sabe, sin embargo, si estas bacterias ya eran sexualmente transmitidas en las Américas, o si mutaron y se volvieron venéreas en Europa.
20080122075658AA1PLvu	Health;Women's Health	Café "aumenta riesgo de aborto"?	El consumo de cafeína durante el embarazo -aún en moderación- aumenta los riesgos de un aborto.    Esa es la conclusión de un estudio publicado en la Revista de Obstetricia y Ginecología, de Estados Unidos.       Los investigadores encontraron que a las mujeres que consumen 200 miligramos o más de cafeína (dos a tres tazas de café) al día se les duplica el riesgo de un aborto, a diferencia de aquellas que evitan el café.       Actualmente, muchos obstetras aconsejan a las mujeres limitar su consumo de cafeína.       El tema, sin embargo, siempre ha sido controversial y en los últimos a?os ha habido una falta de consenso en torno a las recomendaciones.       "Nosotros aconsejamos a las pacientes que no tomen café durante el embarazo", dijo a BBC Ciencia el doctor Mauro Parra, experto en medicina fetal del Departamento de Obstetricia y Ginecología del Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile.

El gobierno de Ruanda lanzó una campa?a para incentivar la circuncisión en todos los hombres con el fin de reducir el riesgo de contraer el Virus de Inmunodeficiencia Humana (VIH), que causa el Síndrome de Inmunodeficiencia Adquirida (SIDA).          El secretario de Estado de Ruanda para la prevención del SIDA, Innocent Nyaruhirira, le dijo a la BBC que los primeros en ser circuncidados serán los estudiantes, los policías y los miembros de las fuerzas armadas.       Nyaruhirira indicó que los trabajadores en el área de la salud serán capacitados para asegurarse de que habrá suficiente personal apto y disponible para realizar las operaciones.          De acuerdo con la Organización Mundial de la Salud (OMS), la circuncisión masculina reduce el riesgo de infección por VIH en parejas heterosexuales.

Su éxito se debe a que los trabajadores urbanos cada vez más estresados buscan una solución a problemas como el insomnio o el eczema.       Según la cultura india, una camisa especial puede calmar la picazón o a la irritación cutánea, mientras que una noche de insomnio puede llegar a su fin si colocamos sobre el colchón una sábana te?ida con hierbas.       Esta medicina tradicional india lleva el nombre de ayurvedia y las telas ba?adas con hierbas se llaman ayurvastra.         Para los problemas de piel utilizamos plantas como la hierba del a?il y las mezclamos con cúrcuma       Rajan Kay, director del proyecto    "Nosotros hemos seleccionado unas 28 plantas medicinales basándonos en la teoría ayurvédica, luego sumergimos al algodón natural en esta mezcla para preparar las telas que ayudan a dormir", le explicó a la BBC Rajan Kay, jefe técnico del proyecto.

20080128180959AAEpvZs	Health;Other - Health	Para el corazón, brócoli?	El consumo de brócoli puede proteger contra las enfermedades del corazón, indica un estudio en Estados Unidos.        El brócoli cocido al vapor parece ser mucho más poderoso que el que se deja hervir.    Los investigadores realizaron un experimento con ratones a los que alimentaron durante un mes con este vegetal, y midieron el efecto en el músculo del corazón.       Al comparar éstos animales con aquellos cuya dieta no cambió, el resultado mostró que el corazón de los ratones alimentados con brócoli funcionaba mejor y sufrieron menos da?o cuando se les privó de oxígeno.       La investigación de la revista The Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry sugiere que el brócoli puede disparar la producción de proteínas que protegen contra las enfermedades del corazón.       Los beneficios del brócoli en la salud han sido ampliamente proclamados, particularmente sus potenciales cualidades protectoras contra el cáncer.       Pero saber si eso es cierto y cómo funciona ha resultado mucho más difícil.

Los distribuidores automáticos sólo podrán ser utilizados por personas a quienes se les ha recetado la droga por razones de salud.       Los pacientes tendrán que ense?ar la fórmula médica. Además se les tomarán una fotografía y las huellas digitales antes de poder utilizar la máquina.       Un total de 11 estados en EE.UU. permiten el uso medicinal de la marihuana, principalmente para aliviar el dolor, pero su uso es controvertido.       Vince Mehdizadeh, due?o del Herbal Nutrition Centre en Los ángeles -donde se encuentra una de las dos primeras máquinas expendedoras- indicó que este servicio permitirá a los pacientes comprar provisiones adicionales cuando lo necesiten.

20080131192548AATor07	Health;Other - Health	Informe: Estímulos eléctricos para Alzheimer?	Un equipo de científicos en Canadá descubrió, por accidente, una forma de mejorar la memoria.        El sistema límbico es fundamental para la memoria y los recuerdos.    El hallazgo fue hecho durante una operación con una técnica experimental para tratar a un paciente con obesidad mórbida.       El objetivo del tratamiento, llamado estimulación cerebral profunda (DBS en sus siglas en inglés), era suprimir el apetito del individuo.       Pero, en vez de esto, el paciente comenzó a experimentar recuerdos vívidos.       El descubrimiento, dice el estudio publicado en la revista Anales de Neurología, podría conducir a una forma de estimulación eléctrica cerebral para tratar trastornos como la enfermedad de Alzheimer.       "Es un hallazgo muy llamativo" dijo a BBC Ciencia el doctor Melchor Lemp, vicepresidente de la Sociedad de Neurocirugía de Chile y jefe del departamento de Neurología y Neurocirugía del Hospital Clínico de la Universidad de Chile.       "Quizás las líneas de investigación ahora tendrán que encaminarse hacia este campo" agrega el experto.          Estímulos          Según los investigadores del Hospital Toronto Western, "éste es un caso único, totalmente inesperado".       "Pero supimos de inmediato que se trataba de algo importante y estamos muy intrigados en descubrir si esto podría ayudar a los pacientes con trastornos de memoria", afirman los autores.          El equipo de científicos del Hospital Toronto Western intentaban tratar a un hombre de 50 a?os con obesidad mórbida que sufría diabetes tipo 2 y trastornos de sue?o.       El hombre de 190 kilos de peso no había logrado responder a dietas, medicamentos ni ayuda psicológica.       Se había rehusado a someterse a cirugía gástrica por lo que los médicos decidieron tratarlo con DBS, que aunque es una técnica experimental, era su mejor opción.       En pruebas previas con animales se ha demostrado que la DBS tiene un efecto en el apetito.
20080220074206AA0NHAm	Health;Men's Health	Cuide su semen, puede afectar a sus hijos?	Un estudio sugiere que los defectos de espermatozoides que han sido causados por la exposición a toxinas ambientales pueden transmitirse de generación en generación.       Según los científicos, los padres que fuman y beben deberían estar conscientes de que no sólo se están provocando potenciales da?os a sí mismos, sino también a sus hijos.       Unas pruebas efectuadas con ratas mostraron que los da?os generados por la exposición a sustancias químicas utilizadas en jardinería se manifestaban hasta en cuatro generaciones posteriores.       El estudio fue presentado en las Asociación Estadounidense para el Avance de la Ciencia.       De la investigación se desprende que la salud de un padre desempe?a un rol más importante de lo que se tenía pensado en la salud de las futuras generaciones.       Las pruebas       El equipo de la Universidad de Idaho hizo unas pruebas con una sustancia química fungicida llamada vinclozolina que provoca alteraciones en las hormonas de las ratas.         Si yo fuese un joven, no bebería en grandes cantidades ni me fumaría dos paquetes de cigarrillos al día, mientras intento concebir un hijo       Cynthia Daniels, autora e investigadora de la Universidad de Rutgers en Nueva Jersey       Se comprobó que la sustancia generó modificaciones en los genes de los espermatozoides, entre los que se incluyó varios asociados con el cáncer de próstata.       Las ratas expuestas al fungicida mostraron se?ales de da?os y crecimiento excesivo de la próstata, infertilidad y problemas renales.       Los defectos también estuvieron presentes en animales de cuarta generación.       Los científicos admitieron que las ratas estuvieron expuestas a muy altos niveles de vinclozolina.       En principio       Sin embargo, los investigadores argumentaron que su trabajo mostró que las toxinas causan defectos en las generaciones que pueden pasarse de generación en generación.       La profesora Cynthia Daniels, de la Universidad de Rutgers en Nueva Jersey, ha escrito varios libres sobre reproducción masculina y femenina.       Según Daniels se ha mostrado que los hombres que consumen mucho alcohol tienen un índice más alto de defectos en los espermatozoides, a?adiendo que la nicotina del tabaco llega hasta el fluido seminal y la sangre.       "Necesitamos abrir bien los ojos y mirar las pruebas", sostuvo Daniels.

She was also quite late on hitting her 1-2 1/2 year milestones. At this point a diagnosis has not been made, the assessment process has just started and I'm still lost. Is autism something with constant symptoms or do they tend to come and go? Do children with autism have 'good' and 'bad' days with their condition?

I walk around my car 4 or 5 times to make sure it’s locked and the windows are rolled up. It's gotten so bad that I have to touch the things that are bothering me to make sure it's in "order". My eyes see that they are, but my brain doesn't want to believe it's true and I force myself to check again and again. My mom had this too and used to make me "check" with her and so I’m guessing this is a learned thing.       I know I could probably see a psychiatrist or take some medicines but I don't really have the resources for that.      Are there any kind of exercises or something that I can do to make the things I do connect in my brain the first time so I don't have to embarrass myself when my girlfriend and neighbors ask me what im doing?

20070429144534AA9SGtC	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can you increase your strength by lifting a single amount of weight more times?	Let's say you're bench pressing 135 pounds. If you bench press 135 once and that's all that you can do, then 135 is your one rep max. So then you keep lifting 135 pounds over the course of weeks and months and then you gain the ability to lift 135 pounds 8 times in a row. That would mean that your one rep max is now above 135. So does this mean that the more consecutive repetitions that you can will yourself to perform, the more strength that can be derived from lifting an amount of weight? Is each marginal repetition like adding "points" to your strength level? If you are capable of lifting a weight 8 times in a row but you only perform sets of 2 reps, will strength decrease? I've noticed that it's possible to lift submaximal weight for weeks and then test your 1rep max and see an increase without ever having lifted maximal amounts during the time of the increase. Is it possible to just lift a weight more and more consecutive times and then it will correlate with a strength increase?

20090226120919AANpkw6	Health;Mental Health	How can you respect someone with no self-respect? How can you follow the advice of someone...?	I used to respect my mom in so many ways. She was my hero. I am now 17 and have lost most respect for her. When I was 9, I found out my mom was pregnant. I never met this man before and out of nowhere he lived with us. My mom knew him for 10 years before getting pregnant.  He went to jail after a few months of living with us. When he got out of jail, he stayed with us for a year. He cheated on my mom with his ex, wouldn't allow me to see my dad, beat all of his kids except my little sister and me, and was an asshole. My mom treated me like I was a piece of garbage while he stayed with us. Of course, I rebelled at 11 and got into drugs and ran the streets. They split up because she was tired of his cheating. They got into physical altercations in front of us when he was moving out.      For about a year, my mom was constantly drinking, smoking marijuana, and generally being a horrible mom. I forgave her for that, though. She eventually got over it and seemed to be a super-human to me.       My little sister is getting ready to turn 7 now. Her dad is in and out of her life, seeing her at most twice a year. Tuesday he shows up crying to my mom begging her to forgive him. He is getting ready to go back to jail again. The same girl he was cheating on my mom with pressed charges against him for hitting their son. Now he is staying with us again. For the past 2 days, I have been alone with him for a total of 16 hours. She told me to get over myself when I told her I was not comfortable with it, even though I pay rent at 17.      Tonight will be the third night he is "staying the night" and I know she is having sex with him and it's disgusting. She told me "I haven't gotten any is 3 years" and it makes me sick to my stomach the way she acts in front of him.       I have not gotten 5 minutes alone with her in the last few days. I have no respect for her anymore.   She tells me not to date bad men yet she does it herself and then demands respect when I feel she doesn't deserve it. I'm just so frustrated and I know she's going to turn into the horrible mom again.       How can you respect someone with no self-respect? How can you follow the advice of someone that is a hypocrite? Any advice on what I should do? Thanks!   =[

20090226112459AANbGye	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Abdominal pain on my right side.?	Hello.      Last night I started to get some pain in my right abdomen, just in from my hip bone. It started out as a dull pain, and hurt a lot more if I was sitting or if my legs were up. I thought nothing of it and continued to do stuff around the house, thinking it felt better if I was standing. But the more I stood the more it hurt. I discovered laying down made it slowly hurt less and less. Oh and pressing on it makes no difference at all, and it's the constant type of pain, not a stabbing type. As I was getting ready for bed, the pain got worse and worse quickly, and got to the point where I was crying (I rarely cry from pain). I went to bed and the pain slowly went away since I was lying down with straight legs.   When I woke up this morning the pain was gone, but as I've been showering and doing stuff around the house, the pain has been coming back. Right now I'm laying down, so it's not so bad.      Also, I'm a 19 year old female. I'm on the end of my period, but it's highly unlikely these are cramps since I don't get cramps at the end of my period, and I've never had, or heard of, cramps like these.      To sum it up, the more I sit and stand and move around, the worse the pain gets, and the more I lay down with straight legs, the better I feel.      I'm going to a walk in clinic later today, but I'm just wondering if any of you have had this happen, or have any insight as to what's going on.      Thanks.

I can do press ups with no pain but i cannot do pull ups. I cannot lift weight front on without pain.   If you know what it may be please help me out - i dont have a clue.   P.S it is not painful to the touch

My day consists of this.   Wake up have to rush my *** to the bus stop no time for breakfast.Me and my friend split a ham, mayo, cheese on white bread sandwich everday.I come home. And thats when I eat a little to much.For example 2 corndogs some water chips and then I have an actual dinner later. I'm to nervous to go to a gym to loose weight. Maybe after 20lbs I would. I just need to know how much calories I should eat. How much of those or more then what I eat should I burn in order to loose 2-3lbs a week.I am in no rush. But I do have some concerns. I am 15 and the last thing I want is left over skin ew. I don't want anymore muscle I have alot already. My legs,stomach and *** are whats big. And I know I have to increase my exersise because it is going to get harder to loose the rest of the weight. I am very pretty and I can see that in my face and body if I look close enough it's just blocked by this discusting fat.I'm tired of asking and talking about it and now I want to do something about it. I'm tired of having no dates and no boyfriends ever. And I'm most definetly tired of feeling bad about myself and the way I look.So I need a straight up nice answer. That doesn't involve any online scams or fake jenny craig ****. Oh and personal expierence would be great to.

I am 5'8, about 120-122 pounds. so i am pretty thin. i tried to get a VS body which is toned, but not buff. I basically go to the gym 6 - 7 days a week, and do cardio for a hour, light weight training for 20 minutes. i also eat pretty healthy, except i think i am eating too much carbs everyday, although they are all "good" carbs.    but i don't find myself losing weight or getting toned very well. i started to gain muscle instead of losing the extra fat, especially my legs. But my goal is those sexy lean legs.    so do you think:   1. i should change my diet? less carbs? (it will be perfect if you can give me a specific daily menu)   2. change my exercise routine? what kind of exercise should i do, what type of equipment should i use, and how often and how long should i work out?   3. any other suggestions?

Also, I can only stand for a bit and I'm extremely tired. I've already seen a doctor about that and all I need is a bit of rest and calories. THAT'S not what I'm worried about.      A few hours ago, my ear got clogged up (not unlike the feeling when you're deep underwater and your ear is JUST ABOUT to pop). Usually when I get this feeling, I can just lightly push on my ear and it will go away. But it didn't go away when I did that.      I thought maybe I just had a wax buildup, so I swabbed at my ear for a good ten minutes. Didn't help.      When I involuntarily burp or hiccup, the feeling subsides for a few seconds, but then gets worse.      It's really painful.      I called my mom about it (who is a nurse) and she said that I should be drinking lots of fluids. I have been drinking tea, water, and assorted juices like Gatorade for the past THREE HOURS and it still hasn't gone away.      When I took a shower, I filled my ear up with water to see if maybe there was some wax stuck deep inside. I held the water in my ear like that for about ten minutes, then finally let it out, but there was no relief.      Whenever I push on the inside of my ear now, it hurts.       PLEASE help me. Much appreciated.

But i don't know which one should i buy first. I wanted to buy the 10 pound one because i heard that if you start less weight but more reps, you will build up your muscle. However if i start to lifting 15 pounds, i would develop my muscle faster but, i don't want to start moving into 20 pounds. Also it's because if i start lifting 15 pounds, my body will adapt to this routine and soon will not take any effect when i continue to life 15 pounds.   I am very confuse, i don't know if i should buy 10 pounds or 15 pounds.   What do you think i should do?   I appreciate all your comments. Thanks.

20090226115614AAJAw3o	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Respiratory Diseases	Loud intense coughing man sitting behind me at work?	Hello all,        I feel terrible asking this question. There is a man sitting directly behind me at work. I have had no interaction with him, either direct or indirect, in the slightly over 6 months that I have been working here at a large corporation in NYC.       He has a cough that is beyond persistent. It is *constant*. All day... I have to listen to a loud, intense, continuous and quite frankly disgusting coughing fit that never ends.       It was driving me *crazy* and interfering greatly with my concentration at work and in general grossing me out back in September when I started working here. But back then, I figured.. the guy's just sick. He'll eventually get better and I won't have to listen to it.        Now, I _know_ that I am just thinking of myself here. But in the 6 months I have worked here the guy has gotten _worse_ not better. All day long I listen to his deep, chesty, phlegmy and exceedingly *loud* hacking cough.       I actually _do_ feel bad for the guy. It's obvious that he is suffering from some sort of disability. And when I am thinking rationally about the situation I realize that his cough must bother him far more than it bothers me.       But the situation never improves, I just associate this guy's loud and quite frankly obnoxious cough with working here. I've thought of moving desks, but that is not an option for me.       I seriously *don't* want to be rude to the guy. It would make me both look and feel bad to handle the situation that way. And of course I know he can't help it.      All I really want to do is ask him if he's okay, and if he expects to get better at some point? But I don't know how to approach the situation in such a way that won't ruffle feathers. In the 6 months that I have worked here, I have not said word 1 to the man.       I would feel uncomfortable as someone he's never spoken to to say 'Hi I sit on the other side of you and I can't help notice your cough. Do you think it's going to get better at some point?" That just seems like it would be rude to do something like that.      But I have _tried_ the grin and bear it solution and the situation never improves. All it does is drive me crazy.      No one else in the department (we all hear him, there's no way you cannot) makes even the slightest mention of it and if they notice it, they don't let on.      If anyone out there has any suggestions on how I can handle this situation without seeming like a troublemaker or a cruel person I would appreciate any feedback you might have.      Thanks

I never take over 3 pills of 5/500 per day, and usually only 2 pills. It does give me a "feel good" feeling much of the time, however, I have also noticed I seem to have an intense hair trigger temper lately. I can't remember if it seemed to start with the vicodin or not. For instance, my boyfriend just texted me from home that he "just thought of" picking up Halloween candy for the kids tonight, and wants me to do it after work, and I seriously wanted to scream and punch the wall because I know he thought of it on his way home and was being lazy (and I've got a ton to do tonight already).       I can see being irked at something like that, but not feeling insanely furious over it. I feel like I'm waaaay overreacting to things lately. Just curious as to whether it could be the vicodin contributing to this? Or should I look for other causes? lol. Argh, it's frustrating. I'm 40, by the way. Too young for "the change of life" I think. Well, I hope. :)

I run track and field, with practices five times a week. Because I'm in the long distance group, my average workout is usually anywhere from 3 to 5 miles, varying in speed from race pace to an easy pace at the end of the week. On Thursdays I also run an extra 30-40 minutes.   I'm 5'7" and weigh 150 lbs. I have a muscular build, and I can already see my upper abs. So i guess that right now I'm at like a 4 pack, but it's not very defined, I can just see where the ab muscles are. We do abs exercises every day at practice, so my abs themselves are very strong. I just want to know roughly how long it will take for me to have a full six pack, and then how long 'till it's well defined.      If it's any help, then I'm already losing body fat, because before track started(about 3 weeks ago) i only had the line down the middle of my stomach, w/o individual abs. I eat healthy, no fast food, and rarely eat chocolate or sweets anymore.      Any serious answers will be well appreciated(dont just tell me to do 500 more crunches a day!)

This happened for a few weeks,  finally I started drinking red bull (I know is not good) and for until now it has worked to avoid that fatigue. However, for some reason, it started again a week ago. I just started a new job and I cant function as my body is trying to sleep. I am fine when I wake up it is just around 9 or 10 again. It has become so bad today that I was actually reading a letter and I caught myself dreaming and almost going to talk in my sleep, the thing was my eyes were open and I was supposed to be awake. After about an hour or so, I can snap out of it and function again. I did the random blood work and nothing is showing up…What is going on in my body to do this?      Please help. I will loose this job if I can’t function and get anything done……

20090226113439AAMpUwq	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	Will running with a torn ligament impede healing?	I injured myself in early December and haven't run since. I was recently diagnosed with a torn ligamentum teres (a ligament that connects the head of your femur to the pelvis). It doesn't hurt to walk or run at all, it only hurts when my thigh is semiflexed and the limb then abducted or rotated outward (when the ligament is tense).      Under normal circumstances I would have no issue with taking it easy. The doctor says it should heal in about two months. However, I am slated to enter military training in three months, and one month of running is absolutely not sufficient preparation. It's frustrating being unable to run when I could run just fine, with no pain. My question is, would running impede healing any more than the walking and biking I do on a regular basis anyhow?

Well I'm 14 and only just found out that your foreskin is supposed to pull down easily and that most people stretch it to make this possible.      Firstly, I am worried. Apparently you are supposed to clean under there and I havn't for the past 14 years...I can almost see under there now (after doing some of my own stretches) and there're some white spots which I've heard about before. What do these spots mean?      Secondly, can someone give me some tips on stretching the foreskin so It pulls back easily? Preferably a relatively quick method, but not rushed, I don't want to harm anything important.      Thanks a lot :)

20090225111027AAD8n1O	Health;Diet & Fitness	What the heck is wrong with me?	I can never lose any weight.   I have always been overweight.   Not obese, but some extra baggage. Haha   For breakfast, I usually eat a banana.   At school, I eat next to nothing.   I cut my lunches in half then just drink a water bottle.   In gym, I exercise my hardest and trust me,   our gym class is INTENSE. It is like an hour and a half long   of nonstop sprinting, push-ups, sit-ups, lunges, & more.   I am sweaty by the time I get out of there.   In between every class, I have to go up and down a flight of stairs.   That's exercise right there.   When I get home, I don't eat until dinner. I usually eat a   healthy dinner and I totally avoid fried foods.   Then like 2 hours later I have some carrots or something.   When I am home, I power-walk 2 miles on the treadmill   and then do 40 sit-ups and 40 push-ups.   This is EVERYDAY.   I never lose any weight.   I have been doing this for so long and I am still   the fattest out of all my friends and I hate it so much because   they eat whatever they want and they're stick-skinny.   What the heck is wrong here?

20090226121618AAblBqm	Health;General Health Care;Pain & Pain Management	Knee problem HEEELPPP!?	Hello, I am 17 years old almost 18 so people know the age of my knees.      i have 2 concerns and i would just like some kind of diagnosis ideas before i see a GP.      1. i have had this for a while now maybe 6 months cant remember when i first noticed it. what happens is when i kneel down for longer than 5 or 10 seconds the back of my knees feel really tight and it feels like a cramp that gradually gets worse the longer im kneeling and it forces me to stand up and then after i stand its like an aching pain it goes after around 5 minutes or so. So every time i kneel down i get this.      2. i don't get this as often as the first but every now and then i get a really tight pain feeling on the either side of the kneecap. Its generally my right knee but can be either if i think about it.      some history which could help you solve my problem:      when i was 11 (almost 7 years ago) i had a accident. i was hit by a car at around 30 mph i hit the windscreen and rolled back down the bonnet and i landed on my knee caps i remember back then when ever i hit my knee it would be really painful but that went after time. now all i get is these 2 problem could it be related any help.

20090226123028AANmyes	Health;General Health Care;Injuries	I have a nagging back pain..can u help me?	i have a back pain since the past 1 and a half year now...I am 20 years old..i used to do gym (not heavy weight lifting) before..It all started when i was on a vacation and i had been sitting for 2 hours during the journey. The moment i got off from the seat after i landed, i felt an excruciating pain in the lower back for the first time in my life: something like a violent spasm. I could nt walk properly for a few minutes until i lied down flat on the floor. Then this back pain went on and off, obviously an attenuated form of it. Afterwards, it hurt normally on the back when i used to sit for a long time or something like that. After a few days, the pain would disappear. This went on for a few months.    Once, i ran a lot and the next day i ended up hurting my back. After that i left gym thinking that leaving it will solve the problem. I did an MRI and X-ray which showed that there was a reduction in the space between two of the lumbar vertebra..I was told to rest and i id accordingly for 1 year...but resting did nt help..I can t raise my legs while lying down (leg raise)..I can go only upto 10 degrees. I can t bend down completely while standing and touch my toes..Since the past few months..i feel a tingling sensation on my left hip when i walk..probably because of the nerve trapping..      How do i get rid of this mess..i Wanna be flexible like before and get rid of this back pain. Please help if u have some experience in lower back pain

20090225110640AAkQoJC	Health;Men's Health	Can't seem to get sore after a workout?	To start... I'm a 21 year old male. I've been weight-lifting most of my life, from age 13-18 then I took a two year break from it and I started back about 6 months ago when I noticed my body was starting "to go". My body fat percentage is about 3% at the moment, I do plenty of cardio (5 mile jog daily) I still eat microwave stuff daily though (pizza, hot wings, ect) fat percentage isn't my problem since my run keeps me evened out.      My problem is no matter how hard or how long I workout I can't seem to get sore the next day, I just get that "pump" feeling for about 30mins or so after the workout. I'm pretty sure that in order to really have any impact that I need to be sore in some way. Do any seasoned weight lifters have any suggestions on why this is, or something i can do to fix this? is the pump feeling the only kind of soreness I should feel now(i used to be sore in the morning)?      Just for a stress example...The weight I use is usually something that I can't do more than 10 reps with.

I am in have a good diet, physically fit, and at about 17 or 18% for BMI. I have had a somewhat stressful schedule, but not terrible. recently I have been very tired because I don't sleep well at night due to my TMJ problem. my muscles were feeling tired as well so my doctor put me on zanaflex which is a muscle relaxer/sleeping pill which has been helping me get a full nights rest. I have used this medication in the past and had no reactions so we know that is not the problem. Anyways, I am now experiencing extreme fatigue in my leg muscles, it feels as if there is a sudden build up of lactic acid, especially if I go up a set of stairs or walk farther than a few feet. I am experiencing a similar feeling in my abs and upper arms anytime I use them slightly, such as sitting up or just using the steering wheel of my car. when I sit down I can't sit in the same position for long because I am felling sensations shooting up and down my back. the sensations are at their strongest when I sit straight, which is how I normally sit. I have never experienced any of these problems before and they began a few weeks ago and have gotten progressively worse. I feel like I am walking like a robot due to the discomfort. the medicine has in no way been an issue. the only problem I have had since I was a little kid is that I am extremely flexible, almost all of my joints hyperextend or can bend in unusual ways but I do not have martins (however its spelled haha) syndrom. I'm going back to my doctor soon to talk about my symptoms. do you have any suggestions of what to do? what kind of doctor to see? what the problem may possibly be? ( my potassium levels are normal)  I just feel so confused, if you can help in anyway please do, I feel desperate!

I fell and crashed on my hip so hard that I dont even remember what happened. I started to cry and thought i broke my hip and couldnt get up. So after 2 mins I forced myself to walk to where people might be incase I was just lying there and no one would find me. Then I walked it off and sucked it up for the rest of the day (it was 930 ish). I was in pain/verge of tears and took 3 advil until about 1115 where it wore off a little. It hurts to put pressure on my leg but I am able to walk okay now. It is tender to touch.       what do you think?

I'm 19 and started birth control for the first time about 3 weeks ago, but I haven't stopped bleeding. It's not a lot of bleeding, but believe me, it's enough. It's really annoying because I feel like I've been on my period all month. I'm on my third week of pills and next week I take the placebo ones. How long is this going to go on for? My doctor told me that many women experience spotting and bleeding throughout the first month or so of taking birth control for the first time, but this seems like too much. I'm 100% sure I'm not pregnant or anything. I'm on the pill because of cysts and because endometriosis runs in my family. I just want it to stop!

Visual- double vision once (for 5 seconds), once experienced everything I saw was magnifyed (for 5 seconds), blurred vision, loss of peripheral vision (once a week for hours), sensitivity to light, and zigzag lines or halos in vision (once a week for hours).      Head- forgetfulness (erased my h.w. on accident, forgot where I was when driving, and wrote "evolution" instead of "english").  For all of February, I experienced HORRIBLE headaches at the top of my head which began when I woke up or at the same time of day.  The first headache I had was in the morning and it felt like I was hit in the head with a baseball bat. They were dull, achey, and throbbing sometimes stabbing.  They worsened with excersize, bending, and coughing.  My head bobs at the neck at night and its hard to stop it.  I get dizzy (see stars) and lightheaded easily (especially when I stand).      Hearing- ringing in ears (once a week, for about 10 seconds).      Other- cry more often, mood swings, poor appetite, sleepy all the time, and the other day I was just standing there and my whole left leg was twitching/tremors (it just shook and it wouldn't stop unless I sat down).      If a brain tumor/cancer isn't possible, what is this?      *I have a doctor's appt. scheduled for next Monday as well.*

20090226125442AAie3WX	Health;Women's Health	Help me understand this? Birth Control Pill & Periods?	My understanding of the Birth Control Pill (which I do not take) is that it prevents pregnancy in three ways : By preventing ovulation - By thickening the mucous at the cervical opening to prevent sperm from entering the uterus - and by thining the uterine lining, so that in case fertilization does happen, an ovum cannot implant.       I've heard the argument that the 'periods' that women experience while on the Pill isn't really menstruation, but actually 'withdrawl bleeding', and I'm starting to believe this.      Because answer me this:       If the pill is preventing the full growth of the endometrium.... then what exactly is being bleed out at the end of the cycle? The little endometrium that did develop?      Please help me fully understand.   Thanks.

I never particularly liked him but he was tolerable. I went to see him today and I just felt really awkward like I had completely out grown the place. The lady working behind the office desk even teased me, lol. So needless to say I have decided to no longer go to this doctor. I am just curious if most people continuing their pediatrician into their late teens or if it's weird to you. The only real reason I ask because is because my parents seem to have though it was normal.

20090226130302AA5hibn	Health;Men's Health	Does masturbation cause acne and hair loss?	I turned 15 a month ago. I've been experiencing moderate blackheads since about 13 years of age. About 2 weeks ago I stopped masturbating, my face cleared almost 100%. I started again and the acne is back. I do it about 2-3 times a week.      About a month ago my hair has started thinning in some spots. It is very noticeable when I comb it back. I thought it may have been my Differin, but I think it is masturbation.         The theory is that masturbation release testoserome which is then converted to DHT which cause acne and hair loss. If this is true, I think I can have the willpower to quit masturbation.      So you think it is true?

20090226125533AA0ePYi	Health;Mental Health	I feel extremely attached...help?	I broke up with my girlfriend of 2 years before the fall quarter of my second year of college started. We didn't talk during that quarter (roughly 2 months) and I started to like other girls whom I met. I never did anything with these girls such as kissing, etc. but I did feel like I was beginning to like them. Once the quarter was over, my previous girlfriend called me and told me she still had feelings for me, and I also felt the same way. It is now drawing near to the end of winter quarter and we aren't dating, however we behave like we are.       My problem though is recently I have been thinking about the girls I met during the fall quarter and have been questioning whether my girlfriend of 2 years is the right person for me. I then start feeling guilty for thinking about these type of things and I feel like I am cheating on the person I am "with" even though I haven't really done anything at all. Are these feelings normal? Do men who are married sometimes think about women whom they have met or had relationships with and compare them to their current partner? When these thoughts cloud my head I feel like I am cheating on the person I'm with, even though we aren't technically "dating."       Any thoughts?
