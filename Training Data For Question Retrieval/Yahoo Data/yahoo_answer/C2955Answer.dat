Tuttavia il problema maggiore in questo momento è la sua strumentalizzazione folle. Le multinazionali ci stanno convincendo che dobbiamo a tutti i costi comperare solo oggetti a risparmio, ma questo in realtà è solo un business a tutti gli effetti. Un esempio: le lampadine a risparmio energetico! Se da un lato è vero che consumano poco, dall'altro dobbiamo considerare che queste inquinano molto ma molto, e ribadisco, veramente MOLTO di più di una classica lampadina ad incandescenza, poichè queste sono costituite solo da vetro e tungsteno (un metallo naturale). Mentre quelle a risparmio contengono gas velenosi, e a volte mercurio. Quindi un domani ci troveremmo sommersi da veleni per colpa del risparmio che ci stanno inculcando oggi. Non è ancora attivo un piano per lo smaltimento di queste lampadine, sappiatelo!!!<br>  E vi sarebbero numerosi altri esempi da fare. <br>  Per quello che vi posso dire io, è meglio ponderare attentamente un nuovo acquisto, poichè c'è il rischio che le multinazionali approfittino della paura generale per fare ancora più soldi fregandosene dell'ambiente. <br>  <br>  Spero di non avervi spaventato troppo, ma la realtà è questa purtroppo. Un consiglio, se tutti facessimo più consapevoli delle nostre singole azioni, anche in piccolo intendo, il riscaldamento globale potrebbe essere ridotto. <br>  <br>  Inoltre, il riscaldamento è dovuto anche ad una più intensa attività solare.

As we all know hybrids use two power trains (motors) this is a mistake in design all in itself, because instead of having a single engine weighing a couple hundred lbs you have 2 which weigh far more together, combine this with the extra weight of the batteries which is quite significant and you now have a very heavy small car with very little room for luggage of any kind.  Extra weight means more gas.  To add salt to the wound the electricity gained in hybrids is derived very much from regenerative braking which unless you live in a crowded atmosphere, isn't very effective.  In a scenario such as the United States, much of the land area is covered by freeway which seldom requires consistent braking.  <br>  <br>  The standard gas mileage numbers for a hybrid is staggeringly low considering the amount of technology used to produce the car, usually nowhere near the 40's and a small gas efficient used 4 cylinder car could easily reach 35-37 mpg without the extra weight and of coarse the extreme extra costs.  The Toyota Prius being on of the flagship hybrids uses a very large Ni-Mh battery that also costs several thousands of dollars to replace that given the rough cycle life of the particular battery chemistry should last till just about when your warranty ends.  So you do the math. |`|ispQWeQmaa	They were probably talking about what's known as embodied energy, which is the amount of energy that went into making the car in the first place. Here's how to look at it:<br>  <br>  For the used car, let's assume it gets 25 MPG. You don't need to count the embodied energy of that car because it already exists - you can't waste the energy involved in making it because it's already made. So your mileage on that car until it dies is somewhere around 25 MPG, although it will probably keep getting worth.<br>  <br>  For the new car, let's assume it gets 40 MPG. Let's suppose you drive the car a total of 100,000 miles before it gives up the ghost five or ten years from now. That means you'll use 2,500 gallons of gas over the life of the car. But let's suppose the energy required to forge the steel of the new car, create the plastic, assemble all the parts, and ship the new car halfway across the world from you took the energy equivalent of 1,000 gallons of gas (I just picked this number for illustration). Now you're looking at the energy equivalent of 3,500 gallons, instead of 2,500, for that 100,000 miles. So your MPG in terms of overall energy use drops from 40 MPG to (100,000 / 3,500), which is 28.6 MPG. Suddenly your new car doesn't look quite as impressive - it's only 3.6 MPG more efficient than the old one.<br>  <br>  I haven't been able to find any precise figures on the embodied energy in a car, but one estimate mentioned was that about 15% of the car's total energy consumption is in its embodied energy. And bear in mind that much of the energy in a car is recaptured when the car is sent to the crusher: all that steel is still steel, all that aluminum is still aluminum, and it doesn't take nearly as much energy to make new steel from old steel, or new aluminum from old aluminum, as it does to make them from raw mineral ores. If you assume 15%, then the old car still gets 25 MPG and the new car, which uses 2,500 gallons of gas, would use the energy equivalent of 375 gallons of extra energy in terms of its embodied energy, which drops that 40 MPG down to about 34.8 MPG, much better than my original, off-the-cuff example.<br>  <br>  Obviously you're concerned about the environment or you wouldn't ask this question. But you may find that even without counting the embodied energy issue, you won't do better for the environment by buying a hybrid - because your driving habits will probably change. I've seen this with several people I know who bought hybrids - now that they no longer feel so guilty about driving (they actually feel somewhat virtuous about it), they actually drive more, and they probably burn just about as much gas now as they did before. This is pretty typical of any energy saving activity - you save energy for a given amount of the activity in question, so you save money, so you do more of the activity in question. I've seen it for people switching from incandescent to compact fluorescent lights, I've heard it's what happened in parts of Europe when energy-saving dryers came on the market (people who used to dry with clothes lines went out and bought dryers), and it'll probably happen to you if you go for the hybrid.<br>  <br>  My advice to anyone considering buying a new car: do everything you can to avoid driving, then decide if you really need the car. If you do, buy the highest-MPG car you can, and promise yourself you'll still drive it as little as possible.<br>  <br>  A little guilt gets a lot of mileage!|`|63e413147f262ec68d5946ef36ffb354aa	There is a point in the life of a car that it would no longer be green to keep it.  Each car would be different and the amount of miles improvement the new car provided would also enter into the equation. I do not know where you could find those numbers.|`|4WVbjbWxaa	The best thing for environment is: to create electricity at home and run your on it !<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answer-finder.blogspot.com/2008/10/global-warming-effects-arctic-is.html" rel="nofollow">http://answer-finder.blogspot.com/2008/1...</a>|`|AA11216883	I agree, that a used car is better for environment.<br>  Now a days Hybrid are super expansive (try looking at siftin.com) compared to used European convertible :)<br>  Is there a comparison between a porsche boxster 2005 and toyota prius 2008, and still they cost pretty much same|`|dJ4PueOqaa	actually the energy used to make a new car is a lot. that why using used car can save the energy.<br>  simoly as that.<br>  but for long-term effect i think using a hybrd car is better|`|JL0lSuTbaa	No.
5zQbG8TDaa	Good question. The honest truth is they couldn't tell you what would happen in three weeks let alone years down the road. Its all a lie.|`|zFsTSrOcaa	No, but since it can't be predicted by deniers either, your question is pointless.|`|t9dKfAYEaa	To what level of accuracy?<br>  <br>  If I could get 50/50 odds, I would bet that this year will be warmer than the last, I would also bet that one of the next 5 years will be the hottest year ever!<br>  <br>  Not my life though. That would be stupid.  What would I gain if I won?<br>  <br>  Just out of curiosity, I've had a quick look to see if you could bet on this years global temperature but couldn't find anything.  You could have had a bet on the month of February having the coldest ever (UK) temperature, (10/1, for colder than -27.2c) or the Thames freezing over so that someone could walk across it, (66/1, if east of Oxford).<br>  <br>  Both of these were extremely unlikely events and represented  excellent odds for the bookmaker.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I would rather bet on Middlesbrough FC staying up!<br>  <br>  ========<br>  <br>  Good answers from Gr8lass and Panurge2|`|CZQU0kMBaa	Yahoo Answers is really misnamed.  It should be named Yahoo Opinions because there is never any reference for anyones generally extreme opinions.  But if you ask silly questions, you get silly answers!   With the radical increase of greenhouse emmisions from the planet from the variety of sources it would be impossible to do anything but guess.  <br>  <br>  This is a link from a reliable source, NASA.  Just in case you might be among those that think the earth is cooling.|`|6jWdhjvsaa	Not sure, but i think we should get off the oil habit, I think oil is the live blood of the planet. Also gas, The sea temperatures are rising mybe from under water volcanios. I myself think the sun is playing a great role in this. For one Mars is heating up.|`|NBW0jjEsaa	Don't be silly. Nobody will be ever be able to predict the temperature for any one year.|`|WKvl8zlCaa	The effects of global warming are not as simple as your question. It's not gonna be warmer everywhere on the planet.   Heat drives the weather. Increases the heat, and weather gains intensity.   Droughts,floods,winds,precipitation,even snowstorms,all are fueled by heat in the atmosphere.   There is no doubt or debate about the rising temps on Earth.  Even if you ignore science, AGW is still happening.   We are ALREADY BETTING OUR LIVES on the fact of abrupt climate change.  Nobody in Australia is under the impression that AGW is a hoax or a fraud by Al Gore to raise their taxes. lol !
