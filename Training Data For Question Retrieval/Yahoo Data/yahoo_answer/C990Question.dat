Joe knows the system fairly well and could be that one piece that puts them over the top. P.J. Brown  helped the Celtics last year in the playoffs and I think Joe can make a even bigger impact on the Cavs.

We didnt lose last night, and I still got in like 14 points( they dont count 3 pointers in our age group, its still classified as 2 points), we won 68-52. Also, what can we do so they cant still the ball when they press??( We were up by 20 points or so b4 they started pressing).

Train at Lance Storm's wrestling school to become a good technical wrestler, and then train at FCW to develop your in - ring personality and further develop your wrestling skills, and since FCW is one of WWE's development sites it may be easier to enter WWE. I mean, all it takes it money to enter Lance Storm's wrestling school and FCW, so you can get all the right training with just money. Your thoughts on this and tell me some improvements.      Basically just tell me any comments/questions/complaints/queries.

I think this group will last 2 year before they go their own way.I think they still have a few second and third generation guys to add such as carlito and his brother,davy boy smith son is still there,and few others and so they got plenty to do for now.   I think the winner of the money in the bank will be either cody or dibasie on next years wrestle mania and that will trigger a mistrust trust in the group similar to orton winning his title the first time.I think though by that time orton will turn face as thpricelesses turns on him and tries to be on their own.TheOrtonon will lose it to on that years royal rumble.

Which of these 2 will do more damage? A full power 12 gauge round with #4 shot made by Remington or a full power 12 gauge round with 000 buckshot also made by Remington. If I was to shoot the intruder and aiming center mass of his body from a distance of 15 feet away. Which of these 2 will be nastier against him, or in a different case: a group of 5 organized thiefs that come in through the door or a window?

I've stayed this height and weight for a few years now so I'm not supposed to get much bigger, if at all. I have great strength in my legs and arms (softball player) and can think quick. Apparently I have great horse sense, have ridden 8 years, and people have told me I was born in the saddle. But, I've never ridden as a jockey!      How would I go about this? I don't mind working my way up. I'm in it more for the experience rather than as a job and to jump right in. Honestly, I don't mind grooming and cleaning stalls at all. I actually enjoy it. So should I offer my services up in return for them to teach me to ride? And then start working my way up from there to hopefully warm up their horses more?      Any advice would be GREAT! Thanks!

20090220225215AA7rlug	Sports;Basketball	Can Kobe Bryant defeat Dwight Howard or Shaq in a 1-on-1 game?	I believe that Kobe can't because he is going up a aginst CENTERS. He will get out rebounded, block, and most importantly he'll get posted-up.I say this because I have made 11,10,8,6 FT in a row, shaken many players badly, and made some incredible shots that I couldn't believe.And I (at 6'3) can't beat my fat but fast brother (6'6'").He makes even the best players(that can dunk) fastrated because all he does is just post-up and score with eased and always hang in the paint .His shots is almost unblockable and it's hard to score in the paint when he is there.Even he believes that KOBE can't BEAT Shaq,Yao Ming,D.Howard,P.Gasol,or A.Bynumn in a 1-on-1 game.

A major example is the virtual nonexistent pedeladas performed by argentines, and the heavy usage of pedeladas used by brazilian players of all field positions.

They turn it up in the third but let the teams creep back in the fourth. And i'll tell you why. What was the Lakers problem in the Finals? Well besides interior D, it was the fact that lakers weren't comfortable under the bright lights. THeir "clutchability" was non existent. how do you fix it? Well the only way is from experience. But how? Make sure winnable games come down to the last few seconds. More than anyone, Pau Gasol benefited. Because of this Pau is now a clutch player after being absent in the Finals. Great job Phil

20090220232036AAiqrIU	Sports;Running	Running - Fast or Slow more tiring?	I know this is going to sound a little odd, but does running slow make you more tired? When running by myself I run faster, but when running with others at a slower pace I actually get more tired. Basically, I got tired easier when running slow than when I'm running faster while covering the same distance. Why is that? Or is it just me? This would really help me determine what rate I should run at! Thanks!
