He is going thru a really bad bout of depression and just felt he couldn't handle a bf/gf relationship. I agreed to stay his friend even though I would have rather just had a clean break. However, he says he feels that no one gives a sh!t about him. What the heck? His family does and I sure do as his best friend! He was the one who pushed me away with the break up and then wants me to stay his friend even though it is very hard for me to be there for him as I don't understand his depression and I have feelings of my own to contend with! I am hurt that he thinks this and I don't know how else to show him that I care and give a crap about him. Please does anyone have any insight into this? Thanks

Heyy, I am 16 and i;ve always been shy, especially around people i don't know... but I know a lot of people feel this way too.   I can interract with people fairly well.... meeting new people isn't really a problem to me... i just chat about normal stuff.....   but group situations are harder for me... but then again, i know a lot of people who find this daunting. I sometimes refrain from giving an opinion, or getting involved too much, incase i make a mistake or embarass myself. I NEVER get physical symptoms though, like blushing... sweating.. shaking etc-.....   I'm fine with my friends..... There are 11 people in one of my classes, and I am friendly with all of them. I have no problem joining in the group conversations, and I am the centre of them most of the time!   It;s really only group situations with people I hardly know, that I get shy and quieter.    I also feel self concious when people are watching me........   I have no problem answering in class if i know the answer, but in one of my larger classes (30 people) where I don't know everyone, if the teacher calls on me for an answer, and I don';t know it, I get a bit embarassed and feel people think i'm stupid haha.   I also worry that people will think i'm not a fun person, even though i know I am! I just have a hard time displaying it to people I don;t know.

Our Mind is the center of the Brain, we depend on all of the Brain's functions to correctly communicate with a person, planning a New Business, having Perfect Relationships and other things.   So If i was a very smart and intelligent person and had a severe Car Accident tomorrow with traumatic Brain Injury.   What would happen to my relationships and me? Would i ever be able to recover and be the same anymore?   Also what if I had more than one traumatic Brain Injury? How many severe brain injuries does it really take to become dead?   Can we recover from all of them if we're still alive no matter the damage?   I know this is a weird question But i'm more afraid of this because when you are dead, you don't experience anything but with a Brain Injury you would be stuck with impairments for your whole life with a trapped soul. Has anyone experienced something like this?

I eat healthily and go to the gym, so I don't need any advice about that, but I would really appreciate it if you could give me any ideas on how to accept myself again?   Also I've just started going out with a guy, and I don't know whether I should tell him why I don't want him to see me naked (if I point it out and he hasn't noticed, I will have shot myself in the foot - if you get what i mean), or if I should just keep on making excuses. I hate coming across as vulnerable/weak which is why I don't really want to talk to him about it.   Basically I just want to know if you have any tips about how to get over myself, and stop feeling like an ugly heifer.

I have deja vu 24/7, **** seems surreal at times. I only drink on the weekends, and smoke weed. And I know damn well thats not the cause. It's like I'm living a nightmare at times.

I have this lack of eating too, And I'm lazy as hell and I'm in bed all the time. Honestly, What is this disorder? Because it seems worse than bi polar.

When i turned at the doorway to the living room i saw him on the couch masturbating. He saw me too but he kept masturbating. i knew he noticed the *** and or course my erection. we both have big penises and i was not shy. but i am afraid he will tell my mom what i had did. What should i do??

20090309190007AA4DbNC	Health;Alternative Medicine	What exactly is necessary to become a Chriopractor?	So, I've been researching Chiropractic studies, considering it as a future profession, however, I'm slightly confused. Exactly what do I need to become a Chriopractor? Is chemistry and/or biology absolutely necessary to take in highschool, or just recommended? And what am I supposed to study in college, I've read that I need a 4-year bachelors degree, but in what, anything?       I could also take a pre-chiropractic program but I don't think that's what I'll be doing. Should I take chemistry in college before I apply to a chiropractic school? In the pre-chiropractic program I believe you study chemistry, biology, psychology, english, and some other things.      Are those what I should be getting a bachelors degree in? And if so would Liberal arts qualify, because that's what I was planning on going into before I decided to become a Chiropractor anyway (I'm currently in my last year in highschool).      Sorry for the lengthy question :), and thank you greatly for reading and helping.

Last night I was playing soccer and got tripped from behind and landed on my shoulder on the gym floor.  It immediately began to hurt, but I figured hey it was a pretty rough landing and it was probably just bruised.  I took some aspirin and when I laid down to go to sleep I was unable to lay on my left side (the shoulder of which I injured).  The pain kept me up all night, and this morning it hurt just doing little things like putting on a shirt and raising my arm.  Any ideas of what I might have done?
20090309185959AAeNoXj	Health;Women's Health	Ripping episiotomy scar?	My daughter is six months old now. I have had trouble having sex after the stitches. I have never been able to have sex without ripping, sorry if that's too much info. But now that I've had the stitches, it's been worse. I cannot really have sex at all. I have resorted to having sex once a month and leaving enough time to recover from it. Last time I had sex, it only lasted, honestly, for about half a miute because it hurt wayyyyy too much, more than usual. I looked and my vaginal opening looks way bigger than it ever has. I don't know if it is possible to rip where the episiotomy was, but it sure looks like it. And inside there are skin tag looking things that were there right after birth that they said would go awya, they're still there and I am starting to think that the woman that stitched me up did a horrible job. She had a medical student there, that she was teaching at the same time, even though I said no. After I got the drugs, I didn't know what was going on. And my husband later told me a medical student WAS there. I'm bleeding, but it's not my period. IT's bleeding from the outside and around where it looks ripped. I mean, it looks like my vagina is turning inside out and there is some white discharge.       I called a nurse line and they said it was  yeast infection. I don't think so! This is not gritty and lumpy. IT's slimey and thick and white. I think the rip is infected, and I wanted to know if there was anything I could do until my doctor's appointment. Thanks!       Again, I AM SO SORRY IF THAT IS TOO MUCH INFORMATION.

Well, Now my jaw looks fine and feeling has returned to normal to my chin except the left side of my chin and left side of my bottom lip.

20090309191144AAHmDcY	Health;Diseases & Conditions;Diabetes	Hypoglycemia question?	I have hypoglycemia, and I am going on a week long backpacking trip in the Paria canyon. Usually I can prevent myself from crashing by eating snacks often, lots of fiber and protein, eating very little sugar, etc. However I want to know if there is anything special I need to be doing on this hiking trip. I know I will need to eat often - but will the usual hiker foods suffice, or do I need special foods to keep myself from crashing?      A bit of backstory - the reason I ask is because last year I crashed big time while hiking in the mountains. At that time I didnt know I had hypoglycemia so I wasnt prepared. I only had a sandwich for lunch and 1 or 2 sugar loaded quaker granola bars for the whole day. It got to the point where I felt like I was going to pass out, became delirious, and at the end of it I threw up.

20090309193742AAZ0c5m	Health;Other - Health	I think I suffered alchohol withdrawel symptoms?	Hi,      I do not class myself as an alchoholic. I have a secure job and a stable home life, and I'm a 21 year old female.      I do not drink at all during the week. i dont touch a drop. But when it hits the weekend, my alter ego comes out and I party hard.      I dont takes drugs, I just drink and when I do I tend to drink quiet a lot. I suppose you could say that I binge drink.      I dont get aggressive when I drink, or feel like I absolutly need one. I just like to have fun hang out with mates and get drunk and silly.      Last weekend was a long 3 day weekend(public holiday), I went out on the friday night consumed:      Half a bottle of jack daniels and 6 beers      Saturday i went out and consumed:      11 beers      Sunday I went out and consumed :      6 beers and 4 bourbons      Monday i felt like crap, which is pretty obvious due to the amount of alchohol I consumed.      But the thing was Monday night I went to bed at 9.pm. I couldnt get to sleep. I broke out in a sweat and begun to suffer serious anxiety. I felt shakey and jumpy. I even has a series of delusions....hallucinations.      I had insomnia and only 1 hour sleep.      I didnt realise alchohol could do this? Is this a dangerous reaction? If so should I have gone to hospital.       Is it just the cases where people have been drinking heavily over a long period of time that it is serious? Because I only drank heavily for three days, and dont consider myself an alchoholic.      Could I please get honest and sensitve answers. Please dont judge me, just some friendly advice.      Thankyou,      Jessie

First time I said it or admitted it?	is what he has, not just a simple "tic".  In the beginning (first grade) he just rolled his eyes like they were dry.  When he went to middle school he acquired two bullies that teased him unmercifully for the whole first year and he developed a more severe symptom..head movement and coughing.. (I so wanted to throttle those boys and their parents).  Maybe it would have developed into this anyway, but in my mind, I don't think so.  We are 4 years later, and it comes and goes in severity, but no one has mentioned it to him until now.  I need to let him know what he has (I think he knows anyway) and that there isn't anything to be ashamed of.  Anyone have any experiences that can help me.  I know the worst you can do is draw attention to it, but I think now that he is 15, it's time he knows and also knows it's like cancer or any disease.  Nothing to be ashamed of, just dealt with.

Many people have seizures in their sleep. Your body protects it self by having you black out. Then when you come out of it your are sleeping and will probably dream about it since it was the last thing that happened to you before you fell asleep.    Just be happy they don't happen during the day."      Did I really have seizure before or while I was asleep? It just me sick to the stomach to think that I could have a seizure, specially since I was sleeping. Please give a logical answer

I ate NO junkfood, but I did something stupid...my calorie count never exceeded 1000 calories. It was usually 900-1000.

I'm losing even more weight now and I want to stop. The thing is, I don't want to gain everything back.

I'm at about 1200 calories a day now...I'm 5'7.5" and about 117-118 lbs now. Please help I want my metabolism back to normal...I dont even know if it was off at all or it was just in my head?!?!?!
20090309202413AAojO51	Health;Diet & Fitness	A fair loser competition?	I work in a medical clinic and we are in competition with the hospital next door in a "Biggest Looser" style competition that started in January.  We have been doing well - exercising and eating right. A contestant on the hospital side signed up when she was pregnant.  She has had the baby and they counted that as a valid "weight loss" and added that to the weekly weigh in. We (the clinic) still won that week.  Do you think this is fair?  I do admit that there were no set rules (in black and white).  Everything was an oral agreement.  We think it's unfair but if the shoe was on the other foot, I'm sure they would say it's unfair as well.  Since Jan, they haven't had a win yet.  I am stating all fact and am not exagerating anything.  No matter what, we will continue to work hard and get healthy.   I'm just wondering what your opinion would be.  Thanks for your time.

Would it be better for me to do a high intensity exercise over a low intensity exercise for burning the most fat weight that I can?      For about a week and a half now, I've been doing this somewhat high intensity workout that I found on the internet.      It something like this, I changed the workout a bit to fit my situation:      Jog in place, 45-degree high knees (20 seconds)   Sprint in place, 45-degree high knees (10 seconds)   Repeat      I do that for 4 minutes non-stop then rest for 2 minutes, that's ONE set. I do SIX sets daily, resting for 4 minutes every time I do 2 sets.      I have no idea how much calories I'm burning but I would say around 450-500? Most likely that high because of the sprinting.      --------------------------------------...      Now I also read from a website that low intensity exercises over long periods of time (40+ minutes) burns more fat. Anyone care to give me more information on that? And if you suggest low intensity, please share an effective daily routine.      --------------------------------------...      Oh by the way, I'm also dieting and I lift some dumbells, do crunches, or do push-ups after I'm done with the interval workout.      --------------------------------------...      To make it easier, let's say I have exactly 30 days to lose as much "weight" (not necessarily fat, but overall weight) as possible, what should I do?      Thanks!!

20090309202345AAefIkg	Health;Diet & Fitness	Weight loss question?	okay so im 5'5" and 217 pounds, i had a son , hes 16months old, and although ive lost the majority of my baby weight, im ready to get back to how i was in highschool. my goal is to be 135. but because i have a son and no babysitter and no money to get one, i have no time for a gym membership. so i got the Jillian Michael 30 day shred DVD and it guarantees a weight loss of 30 pounds a month...      in reality im only expecting a 10 pound weightloss each month, but i turn 23 july 6th and id really like to be as close to my goal as possible... (id have to loose close to 20 pounds each month)  my problem is i get frustrated with no results and ill end up doing it the bad way (fasting, severe restriction) and im trying to not go that route.      can anyone give me a good solid diet that would work? ive done just salads and that gets old, even trying to fix them up with different veggies!  right now i am doing portion control, eating whatever i want just eating off a dessert plate. its worked for awhile just super slow!       thanks everyone:)

20090309194328AAb7GiB	Health;Mental Health	What is wrong with me?!?	This will be a super loooong post, sorry.   Please don't reply with "TOO MUCH TO READ"   Then Just hit "back" . I am looking for real answers. This is a serious subject.      I feel embarrassed and ashamed to admit this and ask for help. I can appear totally normal in public, but sometimes I just can't. Sometimes I feel guilty for my actions, but most of the time I do not feel bad or even realize I did something wrong or until maybe later.      I'm 17 years old.      I had an imaginary animal friend when I was 3-4 yrs old. I made up a tragic story about him, and pretty much thought he was real. When we moved, I just "lost" him.      When I was 5 years old I started a fire in the house and blamed it on my brothers best friend.      I stole things from school all the time until i was about 7 yrs old      Was afraid of becoming fat and would not eat in front of others from 7 years old to 13 years old      I started pulling my hair out and burning objects when I was 10 years old      I started bruising myself on purpose when I was 11 years old      I then went to therapy for the hair pulling and bruising , but the lady did not help at all...and she was fired anyways a month afterwards      I'm sadistic by nature I guess. I'm consistently off and on. I'm either this way or I'm not.      I have extreme irritability and mood swings that happen in a snap.      I get very depressed and want to commit suicide.      I don't get close to people really. People like me, but friendships never last more than a few years.      Sometimes I feel weak and gloomy, but at the same time energized with tons of thoughts cramming into my mind. I feel like I'm going insane and find it hard to sit still, but then again, also feel tired. It's a weird sensation.      I used to not believe I had any problems, but I will admit that most of the time I have no empathy or sympathy at all. I just feel nothing.      I can be very manipulative.      I hate to admit these things, because at the time they seem like nothing. like I don't realize what I am doing. A lot of the times I am honest, but a lot of times I consistently just lie. I do it before even thinking. Sometimes to deceive, and sometimes I just do it out of nowhere.      I also have a habit of becoming obsessed with people. I get very infatuated. I don't physically hurt them but I will become very obsessed and kind of internet stalk them and their friends.      I do a lot of insane things...making up aliases, etc. I used to do that a LOT.      I get bored a lot, yet love to be alone and just do nothing but sulk.      I get good grades but I lose interesting when i get in horrible depressive slumps, where I just sit or sleep for hours      I get extremely impulsive, like I just spent all my saved up money, thousands, on an Hermes bag without really thinking about it.      I deceive people by putting on a happy face and being extremely charismatic. i do this especially to people that I believe that I can manipulate or get something valuable out of their friendship      I'm sure theres tons of other things. But like I said...I normally don't feel bad about anything questionable I do and don't care if it hurts others.....but then later on sometimes I will realize that it was kind of insane.      I feel really crazy and ashamed that i have so many weaknesses.      Does this sound like any kind of mental illness? Can i be treated with medication?

20090309192551AAs60hC	Health;Women's Health	Anybody have an idea of what's wrong?	I was wondering if this is serious and requires me to see a doctor?  I'm 19, I've been on birth control for about 5 years now.  I've been sexually active with one person, who's clean and has no STD's or anything of that sort.  We ALWAYS use a condom and practice very safe sex.  So recently I've been feeling under the weather, I've had a sore stomach and felt sick. There's been lots of things going around in my area, mostly the stomach flu, sinus infections and strep throat.  Also, I was late taking 2 of my pills on 2 different days, but took them within the 12 hours as my birth control package says.  Recently, I've began having abdominal pain and the last 2 or 3 days I noticed that I had a brown vaginal discharge in my panties and when I wiped (sorry, I know its gross and probably more than you want to know). I don't think its pregnancy or STD's as we are extremely safe when it comes to sex, however, I cannot guarantee against them.  Anybody experience something similar, or know what it might be?

Everyone on my dad's side of the family has ADD and depression, and a few have bipolar disorder... I am depressed and have been for 3 years. I am almost positive I have mild ADD.

When I try to talk to my parents about my problems, they blow it off. They don't want to come to terms with the fact that I am in fact NOT the perfect child and that I am not everything they want me to be. In the past I have dealt with my depression poorly...I resorted to anorexia for about 6 months. It's something I still struggle with a lot.      I just need to figure out how to get my parents to admit that I need extra help.

20090309200516AADsG0w	Health;Diet & Fitness	Can I "even out" while maintaining a healthy diet?  I've tried everything!?	Currently I'm 15 years old, 5'7", and 120 lbs.  I'm also a type 1 diabetic.  Last summer I was really skinny so I decided to try to gain some muscle.  I started out eating normally while on a weight training schedule, but after 4 months, I wasn't seeing any results.  I did tons of research and learned more about bulking, caloric intake, nutrition, insulin spikes after workouts, etc., and in October I started bulking on a 2500 calorie diet.  I managed to gain 25 lbs, half muscle and fat.           This year I did cardio, went on a caloric deficit and lost most of the fat, but after results slowed, I knew I couldn't keep on without stunting my growth or doing some other damage.           The thing is, now I'm eating a well-balanced 2000 calories a day and maintaining my muscle with weight training, but I've still got a lot of lower stomach flab (from bulking).  It just won't seem to go away, and it almost looks like it's getting bigger.  Can I get this to go away while continuing workouts and eating my recommended caloric intake?

As a self-injurer (cutter) currently in counseling, does the Red Cross still permit me to donate blood?   This is not a question about former blood loss, which is minimal, but about rules and regulations.      I know they are on the lookout for tattoos or needle marks, but does this fall into the same category, especially since what I use is always sterile? If it is sterile, then there should be nothing wrong with the blood, right?   If there are no regulations against it, do I still have to divulge the information if asked about certain marks? Or can I lie about it?

Each period lasts for 1 and a half hours, and I want to know which period I would work more efficiently in - 3rd (between 20 mins and 1 hour after finishing lunch) or 4th (between 1 and a half hours and 2 hours 10 mins after finishing lunch). The lesson I'll have at 3rd period (if I choose 4th) is IT, so there will be almost no energy used then. If I had a choice (and it didn't make a difference to how long the food took to turn into fat) then I would have it at 4th period, but if by the time I start PE then all of the energy is now stored as fat, then I'd rather choose 3rd period.      By the way, PE stands for Physical Education, so it means gym (fitness), football, rugby or badminton.      Thanks!

20070626043738AAr3P7w	Health;Other - Health	Vous faite partie de quel catégorie  celle qui aime boire du coco cola ou de l'eau?????????????????????????…	EAU       Un verre d'eau enlève la sensation de faim pendant la nuit pour presque 100% des personnes au régime comme le démontre l'université de Washington.      Le manque d'eau est le facteur N°1 de la cause de fatigue pendant la journée.      Des études préalables indiquent que de 8 à 10 verres d'eau par jour pourraient soulager significativement les douleurs de dos et d'articulations pour 80% des personnes qui souffrent de ces maux.      Une simple réduction de 2% d'eau dans le corps humain peut provoquer une incohérence de la mémoire à court terme, des problèmes avec les mathématiques et une difficulté de concentration devant un ordinateur ou une  page imprimée.      Boire 5 verres d'eau par jour :      - Diminue le risque de cancer du colon de 45 %   - Peut diminuer le risque de cancer du sein de 79% et de 50% la probabilité de cancer à la vessie.         COCA COLA   Dans beaucoup d'états des USA les patrouilles ferroviaires chargent 14 litres de Coca Cola dans leur porte-bagages pour nettoyer le sang sur la route après un accident.      Si on met un os dans un conteneur avec du Coca Cola, l'os se dissoudra en 2 jours.      Pour nettoyer les WC, versez une canette de Coca Cola et laissez "reposer", ensuite tirez la chasse d'eau.      L'acide citrique du Coca Cola ?te les taches sur la vaisselle.      Pour enlever des taches de rouille du pare-chocs chromé des autos frottez le pare-chocs avec un morceau de feuille d'aluminium détrempée avec du Coca Cola.      Pour nettoyer des objets rongés par des pertes de liquide de batteries d'automobiles, versez une canette de Coca Cola sur la corrosion.      Pour enlever des taches de gras des vêtements verser une canette de Coca Cola dans la machine à laver avec les tissus tachés et ajouter la lessive.      Le Coca cola aidera à enlever les taches de gras.      Le Coca Cola aide même à nettoyer le pare-brise des automobiles.      Pour notre information :      Le principe actif du Coca Cola est l'acide phosphorique.      Son PH est 2.8 et dissout un ongle en 4 jours environ.      L'acide phosphorique en outre vole le calcium des os et est la principale cause d'augmentation de l'ostéoporose.      Il y à quelques années une étude fut réalisée en Allemagne pour conna?tre les raisons d'apparition de l'ostéoporose chez des enfants de 10 ans (pré-adolescent).      Résultat : excès de Coca Cola, à cause du manque de contr?le des parents.      Les camions qui transportent le Coca Cola sont identifiés avec une étiquette MATéRIEL DANGEREUX.      Les distributeurs de Coca Cola l'utilisent pour nettoyer les moteurs de leurs camions de plus de 20 ans.      Encore un détail : le Coca light est considéré par les médecins et les chercheurs encore plus comme une bombe à retardement à cause du mélange Coca + Aspartame.      Il est suspecté d'être la cause du Lupus et des dégénérations du système nerveux.      Et pour finir, il est conseillé de ne jamais se laver les dents après avoir bu du Coca Cola parce qu'il enlève tout l'émail, et il l'enlève pour toujours !

My routine everyday, is to do at least 3 sets of 60 throughout the day and at night before I sleep, I do about 120. About a week ago, my left wrist started to ache and now I can feel some pain when I do push-ups. Only my left wrist is painful though, not my right. My push-up form is pretty much perfect and this has never happened before. Will the pain go away soon? Should I visit the doctor? Please give me suggestions and your insight on this.   Some of my friends have told me to rest for a week or so, but the most I can do is rest for a day, push-ups is a big part of my life and i love doing them.   Also, I hear that knuckle push-ups is a better alternative?   Thanks for helping!

I freaked out and told the teacher who had never seen that before and she told the principal who said it isn't common but does happen. I don't believe that and was wondering what all of you thought about this. has anyone ever heard of a 2nd grader doing this? Should I take action and do something I fear it could mean something is going on in the home what do you think? Should I go talk to the principal myself and see if she's taking action?

I've been on citalopram now for approx 14 weeks in total. was on 10mg first  six and half weeks, then 20mg next 6 wks, now been on 30 for a nearly a week. I'm getting a bit frustrated and demoralized wiating for the good results to kick in. been feeling wierd since starting the 30. the best I can say for them so far is at best they are smoothing out slightly the worst of my depressed and anxiety feelings but not nearly as much as I had hoped. I still get these feelings, just possibly not quite so bad.      also the worst side effect is I am sleeping ten to 12 hours a day! and when I am awake I am tired and fuzzy brained most of the time. Is this normal? will it pass? because this side effect makes it almost not worth any beneficial effects I might be getting from it! Also digestive problems and diarohea is quite bad, but tolerable.       Is this particular drug not for me? or will it work its magic if I have patience and give it a bit longer? Also it has only been less than week but I am wondering if the 30mg is poss a step up too far for me. I been feeling like  the back of my neck is tight ,my jaw is clenching and my fists want to, ie tense and bit speedy and panicky, maybe this is just my body adjusting to the new dose?  I wish I would get some sign that things will really start to improve soon!      Any advice, particularly any encouraging or success stories, I would much apreciate!
