20090128154237AA5ivbN	Pets;Reptiles	Snakes to own..............?	Alright, so I already have a corn snake & ball python, but I want something new. A snake a little bit larger. I have heard that Colombian red tail boas are generally docile. My friend that is my age (14) has two. She said that handling large snakes to some people is hard, but it actually isn't. Out of her snakes, she said red tails are her favorite. But I am not sure of handling a bigger snake. My last ball python was about 5 feet. He was pretty chubby.  Anyhow, from your experience, what other snake would be decent to own?   Also, have you ever owned a red tail boa?   If so, would you describe it's temperament, and requirements?   Please no care sheets, I want your personal experience.   Thanks in advance!   -Marissa

20090128153732AA2isK3	Pets;Birds	My duckies webbing is pink?Also, missing mama duck!?	It's winter, and since it's cold out we pulled out a piece of the siding under our gazebo (by the pond) and put hay under it and stuff--and made sort of a house. Well I went out today, and usually I go out to see if the door to their food is propped open, and since it's in their gazebo, and it snowed and stuff, the pond is flooded and is right before the food. I couldn't get in their to get the door and Ididn't think they'd go up there--so I made a pile of their food for them elsewhere. And then I noticed their webbing was pink! And maybe I'm freakin out over nothing but--I know it's usually orange! Maybe it's because they are playing around in the snow or swimming in the freezing pond that's literally..been freezing over the top (but not cold enough to freeze it to where you can step on it).   Is this something I should be worried about? And if so, can I fix it!      Also--my ducks have been mating and one of the females has been off somewhere for a couple of weeks--and we figured it was because she was nesting some babies but..we haven't seen her and now I'm starting to get worried--how long is she supposed to be gone?      Thank you! Sorry if these questions are dumb! I'm just concerned!

20090128154208AAOcmVf	Pets;Dogs	Would I be a good "parent" to a Doberman puppy?	I plan on moving to New York or Boston after college, and don't plan on getting married or having kids anytime soon. Looking for a little companionship in a new city, I decided what I would do is get a puppy. I've grown up with dogs, so I'm not a first time dog-owner (though this would be the first dog I've bought/owned/trained independently). I'm particularly interested in Dobermans. My home has a German Shepherd, so I'm partial to dogs that are loyal, intelligent, family-friendly, protective... The Doberman seems to have all these qualities, plus being gorgeous! Also, they're short haired and seem more low-maintenance grooming-wise than my Shepherd.      I've done most of my homework about the breed itself, and have a few questions.      Would Boston or New York be too cold for the Dobe? I hear that they don't do too well in cold cold weather.      Also, I'd probably be living in an apartment. I'd make sure to walk my baby twice daily, as we do with my Shepherd, but don't know if not having a fenced-in-yard is a deal-breaker.      And also, I hear that Dobes are a bit ... not hard to train, but they are a handful. I want to do right by my dog, whatever dog I get... At home we've been a little on the lenient side with my Shepherd, and I'm worried that the dog will take over the job of Alpha from me.      Thoughts?

20090128155419AAYFBxJ	Pets;Horses	Question regarding boarding? Opinions please?	I have been looking for ages to find a boarding stable close to my house.  My horse just lives too far away from me and considering she isn't broke, I just don't have the time to see her everyday.  Not only that but I spend alot of money on gas every month and it puts more miles on my car then I would like (yeah picky picky).  I got her a month ago and I have only been able to see her about 3 times a week if I'm lucky.  I found a place near my house that charges $340 for full care (everything from feed to turnout) or self care $150 (you buy food --bout $100 a month--, clean stall and are responsible for turnout; she feeds).  Now, part of the reason why I've had a hard time finding a place is because I'm not rich.  I cannot afford a huge boarding bill.  My question is.. how many people just excersize their horse everyday instead of turning them out into a pasture?  At his place they turn out for a few hours a day to alternate horses.  In the past, I have only kept my horses out in pastures, so this is new to me.  My mare is a 3 year old Quarter Horse.  If I did the self care option, I pretty much have no choice but to go up there everyday to clean her stall.. so she would be getting about an hour out of her stall.  I suppose I would just like opinions on this.  Should I spend the extra $100 (it would be a huge stretch in my budget) to get the turnout & stall cleaned or should I do the alternative that you read above?  It just seems fairly common when I call around for prices that they don't offer turnout or they turnout into small rocky paddocks.  It seems odd to me.  Thanks

I just bought a female guinea about three days ago, and today I bought her her old cagemate, so she wouldn't be so lonely while I am at school. They have been cagemates for a while now, and when I introduced them outside of the cage, they seemed fine.

20090128155451AAGDdnV	Pets;Cats	Major change in personality? huh? ?	So, I have a aprox.6 month old semi-tame stray kitten (she showed up when she was just a wee baby).       She lives mostly outdoors/in our shed but she does come in the house sometimes, especially for her meals and when it's cold out. She is not particularly tame, but she will let us pick her up occasionally and pet her if she's sort of "trapped". However she was by no means overly-friendly.       But then, this morning as I was getting into my car, she ran up to me purring and rubbing against me. I thought it was strange and filled up her cat dish - figuring she was just hungry and wanted inside. But when I got home she was the same way! wanting to be next to me and purring and nuzzling her head against my face.       What would cause a young cat like this, to suddenly go from semi-feral to super-affectionate?

Hi There,      We had to put our little guinea pig down this morning as she was very very sick and the vet said there was not much they could do for her. I would like to know what was the matter with her...she was always the most active of our 3 females and it seemed like overnight she got bad. She wouldn't eat or drink, and seemed like she was dragging herself, as if her back legs did not work. She was like this for 3 days before I said I decided I could not watch her suffer anymore.   As you can imagine, I am very upset over losing her...she was the sweetest thing ever. When we first got her about 3 months ago she had an eye infection which we got drops for and it cleared up. I don't know if this may have something to do with what was wrong with her in the end.    Any advice or help would be much appreciated. I feel awful about it.       Thanks

20090128155722AATFOzy	Pets;Rodents	We have 2 male guinea pigs. The older one Oink, approximately 3 months old, our newest addition Stewart, ?	is about 7 weeks old. Oink has only been with us about 2 months now and Stewart came home with my son 1 week ago. They seem to be doing well together, no fighting although, Oink the older male makes this low stuttery sound constantly when they get near one another. Oink also is constantly trying to climb onto Stewy's back,which I say looks like he's having a hormonal attack but it's "all" the time. Stewart darts around making low wheeky sounds. I've seen him popcorning during this already also. Does anyone understand the piggys enough to know what's up with Oink? I've read it's good to put two males together then some people say don't so I think this seems to be more a choice rather then you should or shouldn't do it thing. Neither are neutered. Stewart also drink water constantly he drinks so much more then Oink ever has (urinates tons more too of course it seems) I'm wondering if guinea pigs can get a form of diabetes as humans do, in which excessive thirst is one of the symptoms for humans. Does anyone have any idea if his excessive thirst should be a concern that he should see a vet for? Thanks ;)  ialy

20090128160808AAOefJD	Pets;Reptiles	Is my bearded dragon acting weird or am I just doing something wrong?	For a long time I would not feed him a lot. (which I know is bad) But that does not matter now. I feed him every morning; I use to feed him every morning and every night but one day I noticed that he did not eat his food from in the morning and he did not really look that good. So I would-yet again-just feed him in the morning and then he seems like he wants more food but I am afraid that he is just going to do that same thing again. Oh and every time I put food in for him he will like attack me for it. And when I am just like downstairs looking at him or trying to pick him up he will yet again try to attack me. I don't know if I am doing something wrong or what but I was hoping that someone could help me out. I have had him for 3 years he is my first bearded dragon and he has never done this until like around now...he has been acting this way for like 6 weeks and I thought nothing of it, but now that he is doing the same thing over and over again it is making me worry. Please help me out if you can! Thanks!

Along with that i bought a new heater, and a new filter  I got the fish to the car and it looked like it was pregnant, so i went back in and bought a 2 way breeder. Im not positive that the guppy is pregnant, but it has a really big gravid spot, maybe i could send a picture if someone would like to help determine.    I have one goldfish,(not the normal kind) so don't tell me its cold water cause ive had it in a heater for a while, and i have 3 male guppy's a female also, plus the 2 snails    How do i go about caring for the guppy if she is pregnant? What should i do to birth the fry, for that matter how will i know when? What if she has the babies while im not around, and how can i keep them from getting eaten if this does happen?

20090128163049AAxVurn	Pets;Dogs	Are rawhides really that bad? If so, what's the alternative?	My dog is about 1 year old, and he is very playful and active. He loves to chew, like every other dog. He absolutely adores rawhides and they are the only thing that keep him interested for more than 10 minutes at a time. He chews them up and then he hides the leftovers for later.      He has a nylabone that he only chews when it's rubbed with turkey hot dogs. He has a kong, which he loves to play with, chase after, and bounce around to get to the treats, but he doesn't chew it. He sometimes chews on his rope toy, but I have learned to interrupt this behavior after noticing some bright red fibers in his poop... So my assessment is that he likes to chew on things he can break apart, things that are softer than the hard plastic of the nylabones. I got him a smoked bone too, but he just licks it and picks apart the meaty parts. Raw bones are not really an option since I live in an apartment and it is winter...      So, are the rawhides really that bad? Is there a certain kind (brand, type, size) that is less terrible for them? If so, are there any alternatives that would interest him?      Thanks!

Well, she died so, we bought and introduced another gerbil only a month or two older than the survivor Shadow. That was like 5 months ago. Now, i have noticed that the new one has been getting really really fat. And that Shadow has been getting really skinny and thin. Also I have noticed that recently there has been a lot of commotion in their nest. More squeaking more often too. I did move them into a slightly smaller cage recently but this started before that. Should I separate them? wouldn't they get lonely if i did though?

20090128161106AASOHEe	Pets;Cats	I just gave all the kittens away and I'm crying, please help ='(?	Here was the story, about a month ago, while I was at work, my roommate went outside to get the mail and she found a box of kittens on the doorstep, and they were all very young, and crying for their mom and food. The previous owner even dropped off a letter on the doorstep saying that he can't take care of them, and asked if maybe we could keep them company until they are able to get adopted, because he just couldn't handle taking care of them for the next few weeks, and that all of those kittens were 3 weeks old at that time. Erin decided to take them in, since she doesn't wanna be cruel and just leave them to someone else. I got home from work to see kitten food, kitty litters, toys, etc. and finally, I saw Erin with 7 small kittens on her lap on her bed, feeding all of them kitten milk from the bottle, and I was shocked to see that, and I asked what happened, and she explained everything, and I said OK, but we can't keep them in here, but we have to take good care of it until they are 7 weeks old to give it away for adoption. But as those weeks went on, we both grew very attached to all of them, in the end, I was more attached to those kittens then my roommate has. I had names for those kittens. They were Tabitha, Zoey, Blue, Cinnamon, Rocky, Skyler, and Snow Angel. My favorite kitten was Snow Angel, those kittens were all so adorable, small, and very sweet. At one point, I wanted to keep one of them, but I couldn't. I already have a 10 year old dog and I couldn't afford to keep all of the kittens. It's very sad, but I just gotta do what's best for the kittens. So last week, once all of the kittens turned 7 weeks, I posted an ad on craigslist giving away kittens, with an adoption fee of $25. I never knew how fast they would all be gone to their new permanent homes. Oh man, as soon as that first person said she was coming to pick up one of them, me and my roommate said a tearful goodbye to the kittens, because one or more are gonna be in their new homes. And I cried, cried, and cried. I cried everytime if the kittens are given away. I could tell that the kittens are all gonna be loved in their new home for the rest of their lives, because their new owners loved, LOVED the kittens. I could just tell right there that it's genuine. I tried not to cry while the new owner is visiting their pet, but it's just so touching, and heartwarming that I broke down many times, but they just comforted me and told me its gonna be alright, that I will always check up on them and see how they're all doing. An hour ago, I just gave the last kitten away, which happens to be my favorite kitten, Snow Angel, to one of my closest friends, that lives a few blocks away from my apartment, I really miss those kittens. I do. I cried when I had to give all of them away and I'm still crying now. Erin hasn't cried that much since all the kittens were given away but now I'm still crying. I will always have them in my mind, and my heart, and no other animal (besides my dog) will ever touch my heart like these kittens had, and the fact that all of them went to great homes makes me feel even more sentimental. Please, how can I make myself feel better? ='(.

20090128161251AAXoSrc	Pets;Cats	How much should I feed my cats?	I have two cats, litter mates, and they will be two years old in March. One is a 12-pound neutered male, the other is an 11-pound spayed female. Both have had all their shots and are primarily sedentary since they stay in the house 99% of the time. I'm just confused about how much to feed them and what kind of food to give them? We've pretty much realized that cheaper foods will make them puke and soft food all the time will rot their teeth and could cause worms. But aside from that I am clueless. We've just been filling their bowl with dry food and letting them eat round the clock. But I think it would help them sleep through the night better if they were only fed in the evening. Can anyone tell me how much food is appropriate for them?

I have a bubble oxygen generator thing and a 10 gallon tank. I have had the fish for about 1 1/2 -2 years now, but im wondering weather i can make it better. I do not have a filter or a heater or any of those chemical tester things. Just rely on gravity to make all the feces and stuff settle to the bottom of the tank. (should i buy a filter? and what other equipment should i buy?)       I am also wondering how to cycle my tank if i have not already. This is because every month or so, these dark green spots keep appearing on the glass. Also there is this brown/ dark yellow/ black stuff keeps growing on the glass. The brown stuff is easily removed, but the green spots are very difficult to get rid of. I don't know if this is helpful bacteria, but i wipe it off anyways because it will start to spread all over the tank. What should the "helpful" bacteria look like?      Also, i was wondering how often you should change the fish's water. I do so maybe once every 2 or 3 weeks.      Any help is greatly appreciated!!!

20090128163646AAokBab	Pets;Other - Pets	Is my tarantula male or female?	Hi! I recently purchased a Chilean Rose Hair tarantula, the day before New Years, actually.      Now, the man in the petstore PROMISED me that it was a female. I know the males don't live long, so when I started to notice similarities to the male pictures... I got worried.      No, my tarantula does not have the barbs or the fat frontal 'bulbs'... but she's leggy and the abdomen is fairly small. Not... small small, but compared to videos and pictures of the female and her abdomen, its small. He fits on my whole palm, so I think he or she is full grown... but how can I tell? Pictures of it can be seen below.       http://thetallestcoco.deviantart.com/art...       I know the pictures aren't of very high quality, but I can take more up close and zoomed in.      And no, I'm afraid I can't flip my spider over to look for the dark spot. He's a Rose hair, but he spooks easily.

20090128164326AAh6aBB	Pets;Cats	This cat is driving me crazy, is there any way to train her?	We have this eight year old, rescue, neutered, family cat.  We got her when I was about thirteen (seven years ago), and she has always attacked me, and nobody else in the family!  She waits for me behind doors, under my bed, under the table, or in the hall and grabs my legs a few times a day.  I don't ever walk around the house bare-legged because she really hurts!  On monday she attacked me and blood was running down to my sock, and that was just the final straw.  I am fed up with that cat.  I feed her every day, I talk to her nicely, I've always loved that girl, but recently I just can't be bothered with her.  She is the perfect family pet for my parents and my brother, it's just that she has some sort of vendetta against me!      What on earth can I do with her?  I want her to like me, and come to me for petting and that, so I don't want to scare her.

She is an extremely dangerous guard dog!!! I am so afraid someone is going to get hurt with her around!!!    For example, she was in my bedroom at the foot of the bed wen my husband came home from work the other night. She almost killed him! She just laid on the floor, refusing to move and he tripped over her!!!    This isn't the first time she has done this. She has been found laying on the floor in front of our front door, trying to trip people, as well as in the hall! It gets so bad that she won't even lift her head when people are trying to walk by, so no one will notice her! I even have seen her stretch her legs out to get people, if someone does make it by!    What should I do about this DANGEROUS guard dog??? What if she actually gets to trip someone? I don't know what to do!!!

She had to have the staples in for 2 weeks. All the staples looked fine except one. It looked like this one staple was really pinching her. So her skin was sort of bulging at that staple.      Anyways, she got them out on monday and I've noticed that she has a pretty big bump under the skin... I can feel it with my fingers and move the tummy skin around and its still there. Letting me know for sure its on the inside. Also there are little bumps that are red alongside her scar? Where the staples were. Is this from the staples?      I took some pictures. You can't really see it, but you kind of can:      The red line is her scar. On each side of the scar there are the red bumps. And on top of the scar (in the pic) is the bump       http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l283/I...        http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l283/I...

20090128164917AArZUta	Pets;Other - Pets	My rabbit died this morning on my eyes... PLEASE READ!!!?	It was hot thing morning and I was in the lounge room like 15min till 11:00am and then me and my sister heard weird screams like from a cat or bird outside and rushed outside. Our rabbit was in the little covered sleeping room on the second floor of his cage screaming and panicking and trying to run. I immediately opened the cage and lifted him out onto the grass. He calmed down but he was lying on his back. I turned him over and he was as if in shock. All the newspaper and hay was everywhere! I yelled out to Mum and she rushed outside. Our rabbit was as if it was paralysed but was breathing fast. It wouldn't move. It was hot that morning so Mum maybe thought he got sunstroke (though his cage was sheltered and he had water) so she took out some spray (with water) and began lightly spraying him to cool down in the shade. We was still in shock. We also though maybe he got bitten by something. He still wouldn't move. Mum was checking his cage to see if there was anything there but we couldn't find anything. I was sitting with him, patting him, checking his fur but I couldn't find anything abnormal. Then the worst happened. I realised he had stopped breathing and I called out to Mum but he had died. I was really upset and searched desperately on the internet to find something but I didn't. So I quickly signed up for this because people have related questions about rabbits that have been answered. Please help! I'm really upset and I really want to know what happened to him. He was a dwarf rabbit (though pretty big) and he is basically full grown, almost had him for basically a year and we feed him either pellets or mixture of the same brand rabbit food, vegetables and sometimes fruit and water. He has always been happy and healthy so please help. When I finished posting this question, it was about 10min to 12am on the 29th Jan Thursday 09. Please answer!

When we come home, or when a visitor comes over, our dog is compelled to pick up something, a shoe, a remote control, a pillow... anything that is close by.  She picks it up and prances all around the house and comes up to us with it... and she just keeps it in her mouth for awhile until the excitement of us coming home is over, and then she drops it and goes back to normal.

20090128171917AArpHiA	Pets;Dogs	My dog ate hard plastic, it came out in his poop with blood, should i take him to the vet? He passed it!?	We caught our 4 month old basset hound (30lbs)  chewing on our plastic fly swatter and we picked it up. He started vomiting a couple days later and he did it every morning for 3 days. We weren't sure what was happening because he seemed fine after that. Than a couple days later we woke up to him vomiting again and he didnt poop that day hardly. I took him out side and he wasn't his full energetic self ,i became very worried. He then pooped out a huge thick massive hair ball and blood came out with it. I called my husband out to help and he grabbed some rubber gloves and tried to look through his poop. We found part of the plastic fly swatter in there with the hair wrapped around it. That would explain the blood, but we have no idea where he got the hair. Should we still be worried? should we take him to the vet? He is back to his cute excited self. But should we still be concerned?

20090128172631AAZ3hqb	Pets;Dogs	What do you think about shock collars?	A friend of mine at work adopted a standard poodle puppy from a local rescue about 2 months ago. He is about 8 months old right now. She has to leave him in his kennel two days a week, probably for about 7 hours each. The last couple days when she has left the house she has noticed that he starts howling and barking like mad and she goes up and tells him to be quiet and comes back down to the car and he starts up again. Today he did the same thing, but she left to drop off her son at daycare and swung back around to see if he was still barking. She opened the car door and could still hear him howling from their apartment about 200 feet away. She's worried because she lives in a Townhouse which is connected to another TH that her neighbors will start to get really pissed off if she doesn't do anything about it. So she decided to get a shock collar to get him to stop barking.      I am VERY against shock collars, but since I didn't have anything helpful to offer as an alternative for her I didn't want to criticize her for her choice. Does anyone have any ideas on what else would help? I told her that he probably stops barking after a bit because my dog does the same thing. If they barked the whole time you were gone they would go hoarse. Suggestions please? I feel awful that her dog is just going to have a shock collar thrown on him!

Most of the animals have been shot at point blank range.      "The first thing the Israelis did was shoot at the lions - the animals ran out of their cage and into the office building. Actually they hid there."      The zoo in Gaza opened in late 2005, with money from local and international NGOs. There were 40 types of animals, a children's library, a playground and cultural centre housed at the facility.      "There was not a single person in this zoo. Just the animals. We all fled before they came. What purpose does it serve to walk around shooting animals and destroying the place?", asks zookeeper      Inside one cage lie three dead monkeys and another two in the cage beside them. Two more escaped and have yet to return. He points to a clay pot. "They tried to hide", he says of a mother and baby half-tucked inside.      Is this what Zionism is all about? Is this the ideal of the Jewish State, to which US taxpayers send $13 million PER DAY? Is this the Israel of God?       http://gulfnews.com/region/Middle_East/1...

We don't know how old he is, but we were told by a specialist that he is older.  Today, while we were gone, he vomited.  It looked exactly like his food from this morning.  (We gave him Beech Nut baby food Chicken flavored).        Anyways, he's never thrown up before, but for the last four days or so, at least one of his poops looked like it had some jelly in it. I don't mean one jelly poo every single day, but at least 3 within the last 4 days.        I cannot afford to take him to the vet due to a lack of money because of a lack of work.  Any ideas?  I know he is an older ferret, does this mean his 'time is near'?  I'm just really worried about him.  He hasn't been very active today, and I've read that when they are going to die due to old age they get less active...      Thanks for any suggestions.

She had to have the staples in for 2 weeks. All the staples looked fine except one. It looked like this one staple was really pinching her. So her skin was sort of bulging at that staple.    Anyways, she got them out on monday and I've noticed that she has a pretty big bump under the skin... I can feel it with my fingers and move the tummy skin around and its still there. Letting me know for sure its on the inside. Also there are little bumps that are red alongside her scar? Where the staples were. Is this from the staples?    I took some pictures. You can't really see it, but you kind of can:    The red line is her scar. On each side of the scar there are the red bumps. And on top of the scar (in the pic) is the bump    http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l283/I...  http://i99.photobucket.com/albums/l283/I...

I also just bathed her yesterday, for the first time in about 3 weeks (couldn't because her staples)  Also it doesnt hurt her when I touch her bumps on her belly or anything. She doesn't seem to care.

20090128173601AAklEqp	Pets;Dogs	Puppy's warm, dry nose?	my 10 month old puppy (ha... she's 60lbs.. so she doesnt look like much of a pup) was outside in the snow most of the day today with a shepherd friend of hers, playing... she came inside around 2pm, and was still a bouncy ball of energy.. we came home at 5, and she plopped on her bed and has been asleep since (its 8:30 now..) she ate her dinner, no prob, chewed on a bone... but she's EXHAUSTED, which is fine, but her nose is warm and dry, and i am worried she may have gotten a bit sick being outside today... is this just a sign of a little dog cold and she'll probably be fine in the morning, or is there some type of med i can give her to help her feel better (not a ppl med, but like a food thats healthy for her?) can dogs get the flu? she cant die from a cold, or get pneumonia, right? LOL.. i know, i seem silly, i am just a tiny bit worried.. lol. thanks

20090128172626AAxxdzk	Pets;Cats	How should I go about converting my cats to a raw food diet.?	I have two wonderful cats, one is just over a year old, the other is seven years old.  I  am ready to start feeding them a raw food diet, but after having them both on strictly kibble diet all of their life, I am unsure as to what I should start them on.  I have had people recommend chicken necks and wings, but I was wondering if anything else would be good.  I would like to stay mostly in one protein source, at least at first.      Any ideas?

Her name is Audrey. For the first two weeks the big cats freaked out whenever they saw her, but now Ash has adjusted completely to her and grooms her, shares food etc.   HOWEVER Kurt still hisses when he sees her, won't be in the same room as her and doesn't purr or meow hardly at all anymore and he used to be quite vocal, always wanting food and attention. Even his fur seems duller in colour lately.   Am I over reacting? Can cats get depression or anxiety? Does anyone have any ideas as to how I can put Kurt at ease?

20090128181057AA7H3tL	Pets;Horses	Two Horses on a Round bale ?	Ok this may seem like a dumb question, but, here it goes- this winter we decided to experiment with round bales for my horses (two of them). Some how they manage to finish a 4x4 bale in three days. Is there anyway to slow them down? They stay out 24/7 with a run-in, so their on the bale all the time. I was thinking of like putting a tarp over the top of the feeder so they could only eat through the holes on the sides, but i don't know if that would work. We have got about five bales to last us the rest on the winter, and if they eat them at that rate there's no way they'll last. Any ideas how to slow them down? Ive tried to just pull the hay off the bale and give it to them like that, but that's the biggest pain in the butt ever! Thanks for helping!

20090128181154AAcLJjO	Pets;Dogs	What did you feed your great dane puppy?	I know they need slow growth , and protein levels of 23% or lower!
20090128181100AAXqFvd	Pets;Dogs	Great Dane Feeding Help?	Hi , Is it alright to feed a great dane Puppy this evo dog Food " adult One"  To do slow growth ?      The best dog food for Great Danes must contain a balanced mixture of digestible protein,healthy fats, carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals. For the first year of your Danes life,don't feed any premium food containing a total protein of more than 23% and keep the calories down so the dog always looks slim. If your Dane is overfed, muscle will grow too quickly for the bones to support body weight (the bones are developing as well). This will lead to skeletal deformities later on.

20090128175743AAWXAKY	Pets;Dogs	Does anyone know what kind of dog a pitbull rotti cross will turn out to be?	I got a puppy today- very cute, very friendly. He is a first dog for me and my boyfriend. We have a big backyard and are very outdoorsy so we are not worried about the size but some people have made comments about his breed. His mother is a pitbull rotti cross and the father was supposed to be pure pitbull but they found later he had some lab in him.  I can't believe that this sweet friendly puppy could be dangerous to anyone! He is even afraid of my cats! As long as I train him well and raise him as a gentle dog shouldn't he be just that? Or is this breed just asking for trouble?
20090128174337AARdOVB	Pets;Cats	Why do other cats hate my cat?	This little girl kitten showed up at my door about 5 months ago, and when we opened the door she ran right in, found the litter box and cat food and hasn't left.  My other 2 cats hate her.  They hiss and pounce her and are always smacking her.  I took her to the vet and the office cats took one look at her and hissed.  She is the sweetest thing though.  Shes is probably 8 months old now, I thought my cats would have accepted her by now, I certainly have and I'm going to keep her.  We just got her fixed today and I am so afraid of what my cats will do to her when I am at work.   She doesn't really fight back she just lays on her back when the other cats pounce her,  but she doesn't try to stay away from them either.  If she wants food or the litter box she goes regardless of where the other cats are, she isn't afraid of them, but with her stitches I think that she is a little more vulnerable now.        What do you think it is that would make this cat so distasteful to other cats that see her.   My husband says she has a very dominant personality and that might be it.  But the Office cats couldn't have known her personality while she was in her carrier.   Shes been in my house for 5 months now.

20090128174857AAeJ4h9	Pets;Cats	What should I do with my cat?	I have a very shy boy cat who is 13 and is the love of my life. Recently he started grinding his teeth and not eating very much so I took him to the vet. The vet discovered he has very bad gum disease and has lost about half of his teeth along with an infection of the gums. The vet gave me some antibiotics to give him for a week and then scheduled an appointment to return and the vet will do a thorough teeth cleaning while my cat is sedated. I am three days into his antibiotics and he has almost stopped eating completely. He throws up some of the antibiotic when I give it to him and he just seems very unhappy. It is breaking my heart. His ears are hot and red (a sign of infection) and some discharge is coming from one of his eyes now. Taking him to the vet is very stressful to him since he's so shy. He gets very afraid and stressed out. He already seems like he's suffering now that it makes me sad thinking about taking him back to the vet and I get a look in his eyes that says "no more". My question is, should I keep trying with antibiotics and take him to the vet again or should I just let him go his own course? I have thought about putting him down but I just cant imagine doing that right now. What do you think?

20090128183204AA2YFwp	Pets;Dogs	How to convince my friends not to backyard cross-breed?	They wouldn't be doing it for money. They'd be doing it because they want a puppy or two from their own dogs. They would give most of the puppies away to friends. I know this because they have asked me twice if I would like a puppy of their dogs', because they want to find enough people they KNOW that would take puppies before they bred. To which I reply, "no, I just rescue, and I'm into floppy-eared dogs besides."      I don't get it, but for some zany reason, they want to breed their pet-quality German Shepherd with their pet-quality Siberian Husky. (I'm guessing on the pet quality thing, but I'm pretty sure I'm right.) They haven't brought it up lately, but how do I bring it back up to them and convince them that it's a bad idea? Do I use the health-of-the-puppies issue? The "you don't know what the temperament will be because of the complexity of genetics" argument? I don't think they're responsive to the "too many puppies are already in shelters" or "your friends will probably back out" arguments.      These people really do care about their dogs, a LOT; they do the raw food diet, take them on runs and swims, never let them out of their fenced yard, andhave managed to keep them from getting busy for five years. So I need arguments that appeal to THAT. They are real self-sustaining, do-it-yourself, grow-and-hunt-their-own-food people.

How far is it fair to ask them to drive?
20090128182027AAkw8t2	Pets;Dogs	Pancreatitis in dogs???	I just found out today my dog has pancreatitis. I took him in and they put him on fluids, and meds. They have to keep him for a few days and when he comes home he has to go on a low fat diet. He is a bit over weight, and he is a terrier mix. I was wanting to know if anyone else dog has ever had this and how did it do. I am really really worried about my little guy, he is more than just a pet he is a family member. They also said he was having kidney trouble, witch could leave to kidney failure. I think this is because he was dehydrated. The vet seems to think he will be alright, but I want to know what other people think. And please, NO A$$ HOLE ANSWERS! That would be like me making fun of someone in your family sick, or dying and that just would not be right at all now would it. So maybe someone can help me with this.

He hides wherever he can and if my boyfriend gets near him he just barks like crazy and tries to bit him! One time my poor dog ever pooped on how scared he was! Sometimes I'm able to get him to sit on him but my dog just looks really scared and if I get up to leave the room he follows. So my question is, does anyone have any tips on how to make my dog like my boyfriend. Anyone have the same problem? I know this sounds ridiculous but I'm just curious.

I have done research but they can vary greatly, some say they are very aloof, even with their owners, and are hard to train, while others say they are the sweetest dogs, and moderately easy to train.      Most websites say completely different things about the breed, and I have contacted a few breeders listed on the parent club website, they even say different things. So will you please tell me your experience with this breed.
20090128182103AAE9XYE	Pets;Dogs	Looking after my dog in a heat wave?	This is the hottest week in 100 years (4 days of 40*C heat) and my jet black GSD is suffering.      She drinks at least half an ice cream bucket of water a day, and I haven't taken her for a walk because it's just not getting cool enough to take her out, even at night.      She lies on the lino in the kitchen because that's the coolest room in the house but she can't stop panting.       Is there something that I can give her to make sure she's at a bearable temperature? I'm worried about her getting heat stroke.      PS~she already has ice blocks in her water.

I have never seen an old Bates Caprilli saddle before, I am looking at one and the owner said it doesn't have knee rolls, I have no idea if it has the CAIR or changeable gullet either.

I just don't want to get too interested in the saddle. :)  Thanks!
20090128181909AAZoTzv	Pets;Cats	Can any one help a cat in Kenly, North Carolia?	Today, Wed. Jan 29th, my husband got off to use the restroom in Kenly, North Carolina, exit 107 off of Route 95.  To the left of the McDonalds a very young long haired black calico cat came out of the bushes looking for food.  She was BEAUTIFUL and very hungry--only about six months old and possible pregnant.  I begged my husband to take her, but we are driving to Florida and have a dog with us.  It would have been very hard.  Some young men went by with a pit bull and thought it was funny to let the dog glare at the cat.  I know they would have let the dog go if I was not there glaring at them.  Anyway, the poor little thing went back into the safety of the bushes between the McDonalds and the Waffle House.  There are only about three little bushes there and the kitty lives in them.  She is very friendly, must have been dumped.  Some kind person who lives in that area please rescue her.  Even if you can't keep her the only chance she has is a shelter.  Thank you to all of my fellow animal lovers.  Evie

Any information will help me and I was also wondering what breeds? Does breed matter?
