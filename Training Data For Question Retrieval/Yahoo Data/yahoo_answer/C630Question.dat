20090219170448AAbYFwd	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How to stay strong in my life?	Hey. I've been trying my best to stay on top of things in my life. Lately for like 5 months it has been like ****.  Last 5 months have been with just emotional problems now it's getting worse. Now I'm starting to smoke blacks and then probably tobacco in a few months coming. I don't wanna go down the road and start doing drugs. It's been hard for me because I have no one in life. Sure I do hang out with friends every other weekend but like I don't know. I wanna get help but can't seem to get it. Anyone have any advice for me to stay on top of my feet? and not fall down? BTW I almost killed myself in the past but I'm not suicidal anymore. I just want to have a new different life and a good one and pretty much be alone but yet strong. I just can't trust no one.

20090219171225AA3Jy9n	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Be honest...in my situation, am i ready to start dating?	okay.. so im 20 and never been in a relationship. To some of you that might sound pathetic but anyway, heres the deal.       Im the shy and quiet type. I find it hard making regular friends. I attend a college where I don't really have any friends, instead  just "acquaintances" and only a few. My timidness really holds me back. Here's my question: Do you think I'd be ready for dating, or that I'd need to focus on my social life/personality more before I'd be ready for a boyfriend?      since im so quiet and can barely make friends on a regular basis, do you think a relationship would be out of the question??? Be honest please. thanks!

20090219170926AAaxecY	Family & Relationships;Family	My moms a jerk? Read the description?	(I am chinese BTW)She is such a jerk. I have 2 computers and one time she found this forums thing and she has been using it like an addict. Every day she does it while i am at school, after dinner finding her on the computer is not surprising. She always takes it from my 7 year old brother(who cries in protest) and says she would only use it for 5 min but ended up using it for 2 hours. And heres the problem, everytime all the computers are occupated and me or my brother is on the laptop she would go to me or my brother and says "do yo wok". I knew she just wanted the computer so i told her that, she's like "no, close computer i won't use it." I closed the computer and 5 minutes later she is busy laughing at something funny some chinese people- with-no-life wrote. This is annoying she does it all the time, and when i don't give it she punches me, this reminds me of another problem. Every time i try to argue for my rights she slaps,punches, and kicks me while i am on the ground. She beats me without regret then complains to my dad. WTF? Then one time i lost it and pushed her, the push wasn't hard much less than she beats me, and she was like "i will call police!" she calls the police and i went to court then prison for a while. Is my mom just charming?

20090219172232AApCeaY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I let my girlfriend borrow my car?	I really need your opinion on this. My girlfriend got her car repossessed and now she wants to borrow my car because she doesn'tt want to use her mom's car which is a V8. She would be using it about 5 days a week to drive to school which is an 80 mile round trip commute.    I would normally let her borrow my car, however, I want her to learn from her mistakes. She is just a student so her income is low but she always wants to buy things. For example, she wanted to get a laptop when she already has a good desktop computer. She went as far as buying it and returned it after convincing her she couldn't afford it. Then more recently she wanted to buy an Ipod nano which would have been about 20% of the money she has in her bank account. I adviced her not to do it because she never knows when she could use that money, and her itunes library only has about 20 songs.    So now she wants to borrow my car because gas would be too much. I would do it, but I don't want to bail her out so easily. I want her to learn to save money. She is already filling for bankruptcy, and I saw this coming a while back, but she didn't manage her money well back then and would get mad at me for advicing her not to spend so much. What do you guys think. Am I a bad boyfriend?

20090219171802AACrbkf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	... HELPPPP!  tecnicaly dumped because im ... "too clingy"?	My friend, well we had not established dating because he wanted to wait until we had actually gone on a date first. we have been hanging out since Christmas. Him and i are great friends he is in grade 11 im in grade 10 age made no difference. We have one class together, and we talk all the time, he does start conversations too. We hang out at lunches and long break. and after school we talk all the time. then last night he texted me saying that we shouldn't be more then friends, and so i asked him what was wrong and why and he said that i was too clingy for him with that hanging out all the time, he would rather just be with his friends or have time to himself. Then tells me he was going to tell me Saturday (valentines day) but he just couldn't bring himself to do it, because i had told him about me having a dream about him getting his friend to dump me for him and i had woken up crying.   so today i didn't go near him or talk to him at all and in class, i sit with him, i didn't talk to him and he didn't talk to me. But i don't want it to be like this i feel i wasn't being clingy at all and i really really like him so much. he was one of my best friends as he said more then friends. i really really would like to know how i can 'win' him back. please   also, how long should i wait till i start to talk to him again, for face to face, text and or msn.   oh and he did kiss me, we did act like we were together when we were on our own.
20090219171452AASQcVW	Family & Relationships;Family	How should I approach this situation with my mother in law?	Someone please help! My mother in law is really getting on my nerves. Here is the rundown on the situation. She tries to make my husband feel really bad because he doesn't give her money anytime she thinks she needs it. She plays on the fact that she gave birth to him but she didn't raise him after the age of 10. She hasn't raised any 5 of her children. She is so manipulative in the things that she does. My husband really tries to be in her life, but if she doesn't get her way she gets mad. Example when I was pregnant, she asked for money I gave her my last and she got mad and said that it wasn't enought WTH!!  The following Christmas after that, we couldn't get her anything and my husband holding the baby went to hug her and she pushed him and told him to move out of her way. Keep in mind he was holding the baby. I should've slapped the SHH outta her for that one.The list goes on and on too many things to list. My husband gets upset when I tell him that he can love her and not have to deal with her. He says that I don't understand because I have always had BOTH of my parents,But that just means that I have more insight into how a relation ship with parent should work right? Idk but this is really putting a strain on our relationship. We have no money we are dealing with an autistic child, so giving her money isn't an option when we don't have any to give. Please HELP me

Then she switched back to the school and joined the band program. At one of our competitions is Las Vegas this year, she seemed really clingy. Well about two weeks ago she came out and tole me that she liked me. Well things progressed, and we started to talk a lot more, hours on the phone.

20090203112002AAC8K15	Family & Relationships;Friends	I'm having lunch with a friend that I have NOT been getting along with... Advice?	So I hope I can sum this up as simply as possible.....      Back in June my bf and I paid for our friends (they are in a relationship) to move here to Vancouver from Ontario with us.  They didn't have the money but really wanted to come here for a fresh start, so being their friends we figured $1000 we would lend them until they got on their feet and could pay us back.      So not only did we pay $1000 to them to come here, but we also moved from our 1 bedroom condo to a dingy basement of a house that quite honestly was really depressing, having 4 adults and their dog living in a space big enough for 1 person. (We did this because they couldn't afford the rent right away and we couldn't afford to pay 2 rents so we lived together to cut costs temporarily).        So for almost 3 months we lived with them somehow we ended up paying their rent, buying all the groceries, buying cigarettes for them and alcohol.  Basically everything they needed to live comfortably.  All in all we hated this but we did it because they are our friends and we wanted company too.  But the boyfriend wasn't working, his gf was working 2 jobs and really struggling.  My bf ended up hiring him at his work because he is the boss, although he didn't really want to because business and friends shouldn't really mix.      So long story short, after the boyfriend finally got a job at my boyfriends work, we were all hanging out 1 night at their house and the boyfriend said "Once I get enough money from working I'm going to Mexico for vacation" (keep in mind he JUST got hired and it is now November, he has been here since June and hasn't worked yet until this point).  My boyfriend (being his boss) said "Look bud, friends or not, you can't just get enough money to go to Mexico and go, you need to put your time in... and thats that."        He then responded and said "I don't care what you think, when I get the money I'm out of here, fire me I don't give a S**T!"  My boyfriend was extremely upset, he had already put his position on the line by hiring a friend let alone all the other crap we had done for him.  It turned into a shuving match when the friend fell back and slipped on a chair breaking his leg!  (This was really upsetting)      So since this point they have decided they HATE my boyfriend saying he is all abusive and stuff, meanwhile I was there and it was TRULY a slip more then a fight... wrong place wrong time (not trying to justify).  So since then not only did they decide to hate me but the girlfriend (my best friend from before we ever met our boyfriends) decides she hates me too now because she doesn't "respect" my decision to be with my boyfriend of 2 years?  Like how did 1. I get dragged into it and 2. after everything we did for them and never got a thanks, one incident and I get the flack for it????????      So I haven't spoken to her since that night merely because I am appauled she would just shut me out... and the fact she "doesn't respect my decision".  Well I just got a call from her today at work out of no where saying "Hey I was wondering if I could meet you at work and we could go for lunch?"      I said yes and we're meeting up.... but now I don't know what to say or do?  I'm still super upset about her just not talking to me anymore... but I don't want to make this akward and weird?  What can I do or say?  How to approach this?  I'm so nervous and I feel angry, but I don't want to seem like that, but then again I don't want to lie or be fake either?      Any suggestions?      Sorry this was soooooooooo long!

20090203112951AACONyU	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it Wrong to Never Want a Relationship?	I have never been appealed to the idea of having a long term committed relationship. I just feel like I'm being tied down to that person. I can never really picture myself being with someone for a long time or even consider myself being married. I don't think I fit very well if I ever was in a relationship. I've turned down a lot of guys who I thought were really cute but I'm not interested. Though the only thing that is appealing to me is sex and I've had sex with one of my guy friends. I don't care if that may seem whorish but I'm being protective (use condoms, birth control pills). Is it alright to just not have any commitment?

20090203110718AANWVuI	Family & Relationships;Family	Does your mother in-law drive you completely insane?	I got my wife's mom staying with us from Indonesia. This was supposed to be a six month thing...well now it is going on three years. I am usually not home, but I took a month off from work and I just can't believe the things she does.     For instance, all she does is cook all day. From 530 this morning till now she is still cooking. Same thing everyday. I don't eat the food, no one really eats it(all). She just keeps cooking, and when she is done she just leaves it out on the counter all day. There are right now about six different tupperware containers spread out on the counter and she has some wooden rack sitting in a pot of boiling water on the stove. I understand she is from a different culture and everything but I don't see where it makes sense in any culture to leave wood in boiling water. It is just stuff like this that is making me climb up the walls.      I can't say anything cause she don't speak English and my wife just laughs about it. My wife don't say anything cause she don't want to make her upset. I am indirectly and unwillingly funding this whole operation as well. Welp..here comes another tupperware container....Unreal! I can't wait to go back to work!      This is just one of many things she does. This is the most costly one. Other things inlcude, taking things and putting them in little plastic bags and putting them in any random place, Taking my shoes and putting them outside(regardless of the rain or snow). Losing my stuff, Tearing up my yard while planting branches. She will break a branch off a bush and plant it in the ground (in the middle of the yard) thinking that it will grow a new bush. My wife again just tells me to let it go. The list goes on and on... I would honestly rather be back in Afghanistan. I know my wife loves her and wants to be with her before she dies so that is why I don't force her departure.       Anyone else have these problems or similar?

For the first time in months I'm seeing my father this evening. I don't know why but he wants to see me. Last week he delivered the final blow to my mother that he is not even considering coming back, and is very serious with the woman he had been having an affair with for five years.      Personally I want nothing to do with him after all the awful lies and hurt. What can I say to him (WITHOUT crying) that makes it clear that he is no longer my father in spirit? How can i stay calm and not yell at him for all the awful things he has done when thats what i desperately want to do?

20090203110406AA8ZZgC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is he trying to make me a problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?	There is this guy i use to go to high school I'll call him (Will). Over the years in high school we didn't like each other. Until 11th grade. He ask if i had a boyfriend and we flirted a little bit. I told him i how i felt about him too. He told me that It met a lot to him. Than about near the end of 11th grade he started being mean to me again and saying ugly things to me. so i was over it, and moved on. 12th grade came he had a girlfriend loves her to death. i started dating ,but Will didn't know. So he still thinks i like him. Then Will told his girlfriend that i was staring and that i liked him and trying to break them up. Which is not true at all! because i had a Hugh crush on this guy Matt who i worked with at the time. Ok we graduated. he goes to the same community college that i do. He just cant seem to leave me alone. I was walking with my friend Tay and he called me a b%#@. When i was picking up me friend from school. He was picking up Kay(gf). He saw me and gave me the figure and called me a b. I wondering to myself why does he not just leave he alone? I know he hates me , but why can he not just ignore me like i do him? He is try to make me a problem knowing am not.Just last week i was walking me my car and him and his girlfriend say that i was dumb, but the funny thing his girlfriend is cheating on him. I wish he would just leave me alone. I have my eye on someone else and we talk when we can. i just don't understand why Will still thinks i like him.
20090203105029AA0Q9q2	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im scared my friends think im a lesbian?	Im not homophobic, but i am sure im straight (ive never felt attracted to girls, but do feel attracted to guys)  The reason i worry my friends might think im gay is that whenever we go out clubbing (im 17, theyre 18), i never snog people.  Theyre fine with getting off with anyone that tries it on with them, but im not. In fact ive only ever snogged 3 people, and 1 of them i was trying to be more like my friends so i snogged some sleazebag (he was goodlooking but...ergh) and it was horrible.  i can only snog people i actually fancy - people that i know well. I think this might be down to i care more about personality than looks? And its incredibly difficult to chat & get to know ppl in clubs.  Ive often worried that they b*tch that i might be lesbian? Because i know they do this about other people. They are excellent friends, except for they often b*tch (never really about close friends like me, but i guess you can never say never)

20090203110710AAtrNzC	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I don't know how to forgive and forget a cheating ex, father to be of my baby?	The father of my child and I, had a huge fight when I was three months due to his cheating and just being a complete asshole. He tried coming back several times and now as time is getting closer. He's made it clear he wants to be in our lives and take care of the baby in me, but I'm not so sure I want him back anymore. I don't think I can forgive him for leaving me alone through out my pregnancy with some ***** that didnt' seem to care I was pregnant either. He claims he didnt cheat on me but yet started dating her pretty quick after I dumped his ***. I took him back one time because I still loved him and wanted to give my child a family. I grew up with both my parents and it's the best feeling in the world to have them...especially with what i went through. The more and more I think about it I just get really angry and not want to take him back. I feel like I'm not so in love with him anymore, but I know I still love him in some way. I'm just afraid now that I'll be seen as the bad person now for not forgiving him and taking him back. (comments have been made) saying I should forgive him for the sake of my baby. I'm so confused and dont know what to do. I don't know that I can ever trust him again.

20090203104837AAQSLYw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How can I convince my wife to start a family soon?	I am 28 and my wife is 37. She works full time as an attorney and right now I only work part time at a preschool. When we got married four years ago, we discussed children and she said she would want them "someday." The problem is that she recently told me she wants to wait another 10 years before we start having kids. She claims she wants more time to work on her career and make partner at her firm and she also wants to spend time traveling and pursuing her hobbies.      I will be 29 this year and I feel it is time for me to start having children. I don't think it is good for me to wait until I am pushing 40 before having children. She responds by saying her dad was 42 when she was born and she can mother children into her 60s and 70s.       What should I do? I love her and don't want to divorce over this. However, I don't think I want to wait 10 years to start a family. Could this just be a ploy on her part to avoid us ever having children? She has told me she never imagined herself as a mother growing up but she would have kids if I really wanted them. Now I am wondering if she was lying.       Help me.
20090203111320AAWd5G0	Family & Relationships;Friends	........Is altruism crucial?	I’ve said this before!         So I was thinking about my ways of solving a few intrusions. Since the New Year I’ve completely dumped two acquaintances, one of them was a person I’ve known for almost 2 years and the other for over 5 years I believe. But it’s not the casting them out of my life that makes think, it’s the fact that “I don’t feel bad about ending relationships”.    It’s more of a “stay away I don’t care and I don’t want to hear how hurt you are because of my reasons for exclusion”. Funny, mean, distant, heartless, WHY?

It was spur of the moment, we ran outside, he hugged me and we kissed. Then I had to leave and I haven't got to talk to him again. But what I'm worried about, is my parents don't know, and right now I'm in a crap load of trouble because of other things, talking on the phone after curfew, lying about who I was going to things with, that's the general idea. So I don't have a phone anymore, and I can't call him, or txt. We can email or talk on myspace, but I don't want him to feel like I'm running away. We only see eachother twice a week, cause we aren't in the same schools. I don't want things to get out of hand too quickly, cause I can't get much past my parents right now, so sneaking out or going to something with him is sorta out of the question. How do I tell him that without making it sound like I don't want to move farther into a relationship? Cause I really do. Oh, since I know you'll ask, we're both 17.

Latley all i have been thinking about is "omg, what if he leaves me'..."what if he dosent love me anymore?"..."what if he finds someone else"...I keep thinking these things because i AM SO SO scared of loosing him. I cant imagine my life without him and i want to be with him forever. He is not giving me any reason to feel like this, although i can not stop thinking these thoughts. I honestly, truely dont think i can live without him...he is my first TRUE love. How do i stop feeling like this? or how can i stop being so attached. I know that this cant be healthy.

I met a guy there who's 22. He was always smiling at me and wanted to join me all the time. I really like him and couldn't forget about him after that, then a few weeks ago I found his facebook and it took me a while but I added him and we had this night where we were talking a lot and I was basically in love with him and he was being really friendly and lovely. Then I talked to him today and he kind of didn't really want to know. Not talking very much, and when I said to him I was upset about things, he just said 'ok' and didn't ask what or anything and that made me even more upset. I haven't stopped thinking about him since the party and I am confused. He has been through a lot of illnesses including cancer and I feel sorry for him but I don't know what to do, to laugh or cry. I can't seem to forget about him. I know exactly what your going to say 'he's too old for you' or 'get someone your own age' but please try to understand other than that.

20090203110514AALyjAc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need some guys' advice, maybe even some women who might know...?	ok, so here's the basics, there's a girl, lets call her Jill, she's in love with a guy, we'll call him Jack. They've known each other for over 6 years now, but haven't really had much of a real "relationship" they've never actually even met. They've tried, or at least she has, but Jack constantly makes up excuses or ignores the topic altogether. Jack tells Jill that he doesn't want to hurt her, that she shouldn't fall in love with him because he's only a mess and not good enough for her. Jill falls in love anyway. They rarely talk now, but when they do not much has changed, they still act the same as they always have. He gets a little "naughty" and she soon indulges in the "fantasy" of what she's always wanted and so on. But this last time was different. Jack was acting different, still his same ol' dirty mind, but he wasn't making much sense, she asked him if he was drunk, but he denied, and continued. So the conversation comes to a close and he spits out "I'm going to dream of you will you dream of me.   "tell me yes."   and immediately signs off before she can type two letters.      Which brings me to my question...      WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH JACK AND WHY IS HE DOING THIS TO ME... I mean JILL?!?!?

She said she couldn't identify the guy. Her father is working his butt off to support her, her child and her two younger siblings. This family member told my mom that she wasn't really raped, it was her boyfriend. My mom asked me what we should do. I feel like her father should know as he is trying his best to make ends meet and care for the new baby as well as his family. If she would fess up she could get child support and I know that would help tremendously. The father of the baby is a grown married man. She also told her grandmother who is my moms sister. Her grandmother told her she needs to be honest but she refuses. My question is should I say something? Should I send an anonymous note? Or should I stand by knowing the truth and let her father take the fall and bear the burden on his own?

20090203112030AAVwtJj	Family & Relationships;Friends	How do I get over an obsession with a good friend?	I am married, but I am slowly developing an obsession with a good friend.  He took another job so now I do not see him too much.  I would rather hang out with him doing things, sports, etc, than hang out with my wife. Nothing sexual, but he always makes me happy, and I am always thinking about him.  I think this is affecting everything I do, especially at work and at home.

20090203112324AAWCfgR	Family & Relationships;Family	What would you do if these were your siblings?	Your mom abandoned you and your sister at very young ages and you were raised by another woman. Your mom encouraged another one of her daughters to get pregnant at 15 to get her out of the house. She tried to put her adolescent daughter on a sleezy talk show to discuss her unfortunate sexual abuse on national tv. Three of her adult children have dropped out of high school with her permission and gotten pregnant or gotten someone pregnant before reaching adulthood, and the only one who hasnt was raised by another woman. What would you do if you had two younger siblings (adolescents) still living with her? Would you be concerned for your siblings?

20090203112826AA4kRSM	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can my friend, who is NOT legally separated yet take her son out of state without the father's permission?	I have this friend...(yes, it's really a friend.It's NOT me) who's planning to divorce her husband. The fastest and easiest way for her to do this, is to leave the state. We're in Ohio, and she wants to go back to Indiana with her family,and she HAS to take their son with her.There's NO WAY she'd leave him with his father. Is her taking the child out of state without the father's permission legal? I know that if they're legally separated, or divorced, she'd have to have his permission.But they haven't gotten that far yet. Her husband doesn't even know she wants a divorce. She's not going to HIDE from her husband.She's planning on letting him know where they are, once they arrive.And letting him know that she's filing for a divorce.

20090220121704AA1gjrJ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Courtesy to those NOT invited to small wedding?	We're getting married in June, and having a very small wedding; only about 40 people will be there.      My Fiance and I both have large families, and we determined that if we invited EVERYONE, there would be over 200 people there, which we A. cannot afford, and B. don't want to deal with.      Thus, there are a lot of people who are not on the invite list.      However, we don't want them to feel snubbed...is there any way to do this? I thought that sending out a nicely worded announcement to the effect of us wanting them to know of our marriage, but explaining that the wedding was very small would be polite.       Also, are there any 'hard and fast' rules that apply to inviting family members? My sister told me that I can't invite one aunt without inviting all aunts/uncles, and can't invite one cousin without inviting all the siblings from that family. Is this true?      Also, is there any tactful way to imply that people with small children might ought to get a baby sitter? The people in my family are...fertile, and many have as many as 6 children. This EXPLODES our headcount, and will make our wedding resemble a daycare center. Is there any way around this?      I'm not anti-child, by any means, but I don't want 30 children at a 50 person wedding.

20090219184001AAXGCea	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How to have a life of my own when dating?	This is going to sound really pathetic but when I date I like spending time with the guy and when we're apart, I spend a lot of time thinking about him and pretty much can't wait until we're together. I do want a life of my own because I feel like the guy should be bonus of your life and you shouldn't put all your happiness into a person.      I'm really not sure where to start. I just feel lost. I guess I've placed a lot of happiness in my relationships and in dating, that I don't know how to have a life of my own. It really annoys my bf and I don't want to lose him because I'm needy. I don't want to be needy but I just don't know where to start and what to do.      And I feel so lonely when I'm not with him because I live on my own and friends come over from time to time and I do go to my college classes and to work, but its something that's hard to deal for me.       I guess I don't know where to place my happiness besides a boyfriend and how to deal with the loneliness.

She took class with my husband and she was in his group(She wanted to be in his group and change her group with him). My husband told me about her so many times that I felt so jealous and thats where everything started. She added him on facebook and myspace.  She invited him and other girl who was in my husband's group to her house to work on a project. when He was leaving with me (we have only one car so I went there with him) she said"you can come at anytime you want, my husband is at work most the time and I feel alone".that bich text my husband couple times even in night hours about what time she will be in class and her story. I asked him and he got so upset with me and said that I am so jealous. there were times when I got done with class early so I went to his class and she was siting with him too closesly and when she was talking with him she is touching him on thighs and arms. And he is also laughing and joking around.I was happy that he doesn't have a class with her anymore.    on Feb 2 she texted him that if he got graded for the project that she did and he texted her back. My husband knows that I don't like her cuzz what she said in front of me was disrespectful. I was so mad on how that sltt ask him to comeover in front of me. He didn't told me that she texted him lately and he replied to her. Now she is staing in contact with him and he is not seeing that but I am so mad.

20090219184337AAtISAq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls - does she like me?	I like this girl who I have been friends with for around a year, but ever since two months ago I've really stopped talking to her. Now I'm starting to occasionally talk to her but not excessively.      Anyway, back when I didn't like her and liked a close friend of hers, I told her, and she was really against it. She said that she was too slutty for me and that she drinks at party's and that she had a bad haricut. One time the girl I used to like got braces (dont worry I AM in high school) and my friend said you know she got braces! And then I said, yeah but only on the top, and my friend said 'yeah, well like we see the bottom anyway!'. The girl I used to like also wasnt a slut and did not act like it, and was not known for it!! Yet they were still friends and if I asked the friend who I like right now if she was friends with the girl who i used to like who she badmouthed, she would say 'of course i am!'. Why wouldn't you be happy that I like a friend of yours? I thought it could be cuz she liked me...      Also, this girl confonted randomly a girl who I was friends with for a long time, a sister to me and she asked this girl if me and her were going out - but i dont know how she even knew we were friends! I barely talked to my old friend in front of this girl!      Now I just would like to know, Ive never been compeltely overly close with this girl that I like, but I have been her friend, althought I havent talked to her in a while. I just started to talk to her again and she said she missed me and asked if I liked anyone new, she also said we should hang out soon... is it possible that she likes me?

Ok, so I get compliments all the time about how pretty/hott I am, so how come I don't get approached by guys, or people just wanting to be my friend (at my school all the pretty girls are popular).    I'm kinda shy to start out with, but if someone approaches me and starts a convo, I can talk for hours.       So do you think people are intimidated?    Do I sound conceited, I'm not trying to be, it's really hard to word this. How come its hard for me to make friends/find bf?      Thanks for any help!
20090219185805AAcF09s	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Girlfriends, attractiveness, sex and porn?	So I have always enjoyed my porn. Hot women doing hot things, its all good. I started dating this girl six months ago. The sex was fun, it was all new and everything, and i still watched porn. Now, I feel like she has grown less attractive in my eyes and the sex has gotten boring. I have stopped watching porn, thinking that it is one of the causes of me thinking she is less attractive (I mean lets face it, if she was fake tanned, had huge boobs, and a big ol' ***, and makeup 24/7 I wouldnt be writing this). My question is is porn really affecting this relationship(because no man watches the same video for six months) or is it just stale from time and she has just changed in my eyes due to it.
20090219190109AAEh9mY	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is love fundamental for a healthy life?	I'm 21 and never been in a relationship, nor desire to be in one. I'm probably asexual. I think society puts way too much emphasis on relationships and finding that special someone. That being said, I only have one or two friends. It's hard for me to get close to people in general...kind of because I don't see why people would want to hang out with me. So I guess in some ways, I have low-self esteem.   My question is, am I missing out on what life is all about?
20090219180314AActIhi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should i get rid of this guy or is he a keeper(Easy Points!!)?	Theres this guy that i like, and he has a girlfriend. Lets just say his first name is T. We have been friends since last year. He has a girlfriend, but he likes me! LAst year, he had a girlfriend for 2 years, but we secretly liked eachother. We are really good friends rite now. Now, he has a different girlfriend cuz of problems with his first girl. We talked things out and we both know we have a crush on eachother, but the thing is, is his best friend used to like me but i didnt really like him and he would get mad if me and T were to be boyfriend and girlfriend. I think thats why he never asked me out. Also because wen he was single, i was taken and wen i was single he was taken. 2 months ago we went to the movies, and he really wanted to kiss me but we didnt. He did on the cheek tho once. its really confusing for both of uss because he doesnt want his best friend to get madd, but we want to be together=/ i dont really know what to do!

20090219182515AAKWzRM	Family & Relationships;Friends	Would you be upset in this situation?	alright. this WILL be long. so my bestie(girl) likes one of my guy friends. But the thing is, i stopped talking to the guy because i honestly thought he was a little too cocky, & well some other things too.      the girl.. lets call her..Jenna.   & the guy. lets call him Erik.   so jenna likes erik, but erik doesn't like jenna.  Jenna is obsessed with getting him to like her... (Jenna has liked erik for like...9-10+ months)(so thats pretty freaking long)      Jenna. She is/(was?) my bestie. I've known her for two years.We met on our school's cross country team. so we always used to go running together. like. EVERY SINGLE DAY.we'd talk every day. we'd tell secrets, & know we could trust eachother. there's not much i can say that i dont like about her.      Erik. He's the SWEETEST guy possible.he's super athletic. very smart. trustworthy.caring.i love his smile. he's sorta obsessed with his muscles & exercise.(thats normal, right?) i like everything about him. except eh.. im not attracted to him.lol.      btw..Jenna & i have the same friends. It's like a circle of friendship. her friends are mine. & mine are hers.      so... at the beginning of last year, we made a list of promises with eachother, that we'd keep..   so far. i can say i haven't broken a promise. we alternated on adding promises to the list...etc etc etc...   basically they were friendship promises. like.."i promise i'll be there".. da da da...    but the FIRST thing i wrote down was:    "i promise to never let a guy get between our friendship"    (she didnt take much thought of it since she didnt like erik at the time)..i think she sorta well..forgot about the list..      -one more thing. it takes A LOT to get me upset.      last week, i had surgery, she called the night i had it.but seriously..the night of?!?! i couldn't really talk because well i was really in a lot of pain, & the doctors came in to give me some morphine, like 2 seconds after i answered her call. so of course i called her back. but once i did. she said she had to go. .i thought jenna would be the type of person that would be AT the hospital. & stay beside me every second...or at least come to visit the first chance she got.   (i mean, well thats what **iiii** would do if this happened to her, so i expected the same)      on valentine's day, my best guy friend(blake) & one of my most recent friends(geetika) came to visit, to see how i was, and well.. eh.. i honestly didnt really expect it from them. i expected it more from jenna.      i felt sort of betrayed by her, because i found out she wrote a note to Erik and was going to put it in Erik's mailbox on valentine's day. & she "couldn't" even call, or come visit.      my sister, mom, & cousin were all telling me that it wasnt right of jenna to have time to write a note to erik, but not even have time to ask how i was doing.       i've been going through a bunch since last february, im sure i can say, its been the most depressing year yet. jenna knew everything that was going on, & she was ALWAYS there for me. that's what besties do. but jenna WASN'T there when i NEEDED her the MOST.      theres this quote i go by..:"You always knew, after shitty things happened, who your real friends were."   blake & geetika, yes.   jenna? not so much.      i IMed her a few nights ago, asking why things weren't the same between us anymore, & she well. i guess she didnt notice until i pointed it out. i made it pretty obvious i was upset, but i was pretty pissed that she didnt notice. the next day, she called, but i didnt answer.(on purpose)      we haven't talked at all when we eat lunch together. which is a bit awkward, since im usually the one who starts all the conversations with everyone at lunch. so our lunch table.. is like you can't hear anything but crickets.       i gave her this present for christmas.it's a keychain.in the shape of a heart made out of wood. the heart is cut down the middle(i have the other half) & it has our initials with the word "best friends".   ever since i gave it to her, we've worn it everyday on our lanyards for school.   i didnt wear mine today. she noticed.      im afraid to lose her. but. if she's not going to be there for me, i don't really have a bestie, do i?    i think i have a reason to be upset, and i honestly think it's a good reason to be upset.. what do you think?

20090219183616AAmSM7Y	Family & Relationships;Friends	Does my step daughters behavior with her classmate seem patronizing?	So, my step-daughter Lena is in high school. Her locker is beside a girl in her grade who has no other friends. This girl is acts differently (might have a learning disability) and eats alone at lunch etc... They have had a few classes together and Lena started to make an effort to say hi to the girl and make talk with her (ie. ask her about her courses etc.) The girl seems to appreciate it and Lena isn't rude or demeaning. They don't hang out.    The question is: do you think this seems patronizing? Lena just acts like she would if she was talking to any other classmate but I wasn't sure what to tell her when she asked.  Any idea's?

A couple months ago my brother was married and had a couple of strippers at the bachelor party.  These strippers were beyond skanky, and did things that went beyond the typical stripper.        Do men loose all sense of right and wrong when put in this situation or do they think they will look like less of a man if they don't participate?  I just don't get what they get out of being in a whole room of their friends being turned on all at the same time.  Please enlighten me!
20090219185157AAcLJyc	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I know you can't make someone love you, but can a guy work at getting his feelings back again? (read)?	So my Xbf and I had a talk. He says he lost his feelings to have a girlfriend. I want your opinion on this, but please no rude answers.   This is some of what he said...      Me: i mean when someone wants something and they work at it with all their hard work, i thought you were suppose to come out on top and achieve it      Him: that's usually how it goes .. but we both have found out its not always the case      Me: yeah      Him: and that pisses me off cuz i know how much you've tried to go against everything you know to get rid of me and it wont work .. Ive tried everything i could to get my feelings back and i simply fail      Me: i don't think you've tried everything'      Him: well i don't know what else i could do .. cuz Ive done everything i know .. Ive cried it out for a while .. Ive talked to ppl Ive done everything .. i just cant get an interest in a gf      Me: have you thought about all the times we've had together, then time where we can be cuddling and look into each others eyes and it feels like everything's never going to go wrong, because i do everyday and its so hard because then i start to cry and i have to lie to my parents about why im crying, and i cant tell anyone about it because all they do is say "yeah" or "oh" or "that sucks"      Him: yeah ive tried it .. and it pushes everything farther away it seems like .. i think about us watching P.S. i love you and hanging out and all the greatest times we've had and it has no effect on me whatsoever except make me more angry as to why i cant get my feelings back      Him: its like im numb all over            Yes this was over AIM.   Yes we are 17 and in High school.   And this all may sound ridiculous, but I love him and he used to love me, bu tone day he decided he didn't want a gf anymore and he broke up with me, and I want him back so bad, but he still, after 4 months, dose not have a interest in getting a gf.   He says he wants them to come back for me though.

20090220152603AAlxSrW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this guy just afraid to let go of his feelings or am I chasing him off by telling him my feelings?	He is my boyfriend but not for very long (3 months). There was a point in our relationship when he was really sweet...he fixes me something to eat, make me some coffee, hugs me a lot and stuff. Then he started to change, he has become emotionally distant. I was thinking he is losing interest because I have been telling him how I feel about him and stuff but everytime I hint that I am moving forward, he gets sad. When I thought he wasn't interested anymore and I started to be open for dates with other guys, he got jealous and hurt. I could not understand him. He seems to avoid being touchy. One thing about him though is that he has always been vocal and proud of his being tough and macho. Has this something to with his emotional restraints or maybe he is just not that as interested anymore?
20090219182558AAtqWjb	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How many times have you cheated?	Be honest considering you are anonymous.  How many relationships you've been in and how many times out of the relationships you've cheated.      ME      Partners/Relationship =12      Times Cheated = 1      FYI just because it wasn't a relationship doesn't mean you can't cheat. Include everything. Honestly I think females cheat more than males.

20090219181607AA5JEuN	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my guy friend all of a sudden wanting to?	My guy friend & I have started back talking again after 2 weeks of not. I like him but he was getting over his ex g/f's cheating on him. I guess I was bugging him too much (ex: calling/texting) but I told him sorry about that & I just wanted clear communication between me & all my friends. He hasn't responded, called or anything. Then out of the blue, two weeks later he texts me & says "I haven't heard from you in forever!, lets go out to lunch today." So I went out to lunch with him last weekend & he told me that he had a dream about me & thought that we should hangout. He hugged me in the beginning & at the end pretty tight. He never used to return my texts/calls until now which is really weird. We are hanging out tomorrow night & that never happens b/c he used to say he was busy with other plans. I asked him to pick me up & he said "ya ha ha it should be lol. I'll clean my car then." Then I said "ok it's a date!" & he said "yep yep tomorrow night." My question is why is he all of a sudden wanting to hangout with me? He has always been really hard to get ahold of & now it's a piece of cake!
20090219175853AAYR6r5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Cheating mother. Help please!?	I have noticed my mom talking to this one guy at my soccer games. His name is Greg, and he is the dad of one of the other girls on my team. He is divorced but my mom and dad are still married. I woke up one night and saw that my mom's car wasn't in the driveway. I tried calling her phone but she left it at home. I didn't know where she was until I saw a post it in the trash with Greg's home address on it. I suspect my mom is cheating on my dad. What do I do?!      I'm 15 by the way.
20090219181435AAC84Wx	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Okay guys, serious question time.?	1. Do you think girls should do as much of the asking out as guys?   2. Do you hate flirts/teases?   3. What do you look for most in a girl?   4. Do you hate girls that use the fact that they are a girl to get what they want?      And throw in any other crap you want.      I'll go first.      1. Absolutely.   2. Incredibly so, one of my biggest pet peeves.   3. Mature, nice, faithful, funny, pretty..   4. Another one of the things I hate most.

20090220100336AA0zBq5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	20 and never had or want a girlfriend, is that weird?	I am a 20 year old guy in college and I dont ever want a relationship. I have never had a girlfriend or wanted one. I have never been good with woman, never could talk to them much. I have had sex once when I got drunk one night. I had my first kiss, first bj and lost my virginity in the same night. That was first and last time I did any of that. We talked the next day then after that did not talk much after that. But I dont want a girlfriend anyway, is it weird to want to be alone???
20090220164302AAnzTwH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	These questions are asked a lot, but...I'm unsure about my near-boyfriend? Does he still feel the same?	A year ago, a close friend of mine admitted to me that he really liked me. It was strong for a little bit, but after a while we did have to resume our normal lives and couldn't concentrate on it much. Like the idiotic non-move-making person I am, I didn't jump on this wonderful chance that was right before me when I was certain that he had feelings. I didn't ask him out...frankly, I didn't do much of anything. It's not really my department! I wasn't sure what to do next! (I regret it now...)   Later, some friends of his were fake-harassing me and asking if I liked him (they still had no idea). I didn't give them a straight answer because I didn't know what he would want me to say, but somehow someone told him that I said I didn't have feelings for him. Then I had to go explain to him and...... Yes, imagine the height of awkwardness and regret on my pitiful part....   Now a while has passed. Since lately I've been almost in a depression (he may or may not know yet, I've been trying not to show it), whoever I'm with, things always seem a little weird... We almost don't say anything anymore, and therefore we don't really laugh like we used to. Lately it's almost as if he's much more happy when he's with his other friends. It's killing me. But we're still happy I guess....?   I figure, if he had gone to such great lengths to admit that he liked me a year ago, took such a risk, he wouldn't just stop after all this, right? He's also not at all a 'player,' jerk, or anything of that sort; he's a really great guy. Whatever it is, it's my fault; I haven't been myself lately. I don't know how I used to be. So...lately I've been thinking, maybe I've let him slip away from me?      Sorry... :)
20090220164158AA8aJBd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guyss? So, about this guy i like...i need advice.?	I was talking to him. (Like always)   But we were talking about who we like. (texting)   I told him someone in the group we hang outt with.   He said that was cool. I told him about how this guy told me that he liked me over a text. I told him that was sooo lame.   He agreed and said that guys shouldn't tell over text.      Sooo, how should i tell him.       I was thinking about telling him when i was walking with him and just be like...      I really like you but i don't know how to tell you. REALLY FAST!   and then he would be like what? and i would just say nvm...      but what if he does here me and he says, oh, or yeah i like you too, or i don't like you, or lets just be friends, or cool, or eww, or whatever guys say, then what would i say back.       and other ideas on how to tell a guy...without text and without just going up to him and telling him and scaring me to death!

20090220163539AAJUGM7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do (Please read)?	I and my fiance have been together for almost 2 years now. Before I met him, he had been dating another girl (we'll call her "Sue") but they had been apart for about a month when we started dating. I've been having these odd feelings about him and "Sue" but I pushed them away, thinking they were nothing. Then I learned that he had taken a sudden "interest" in attending the same church he had attended before we started dating (where "Sue" also attends) and I was suspicious of that. To calm my nerves, I asked him if he had any interest at all in "Sue" and to be honest with me. He told me he didn't and I believed him. But I just found out today that he had lied to me. I won't say HOW I got it, but I found where he had written to an online source about how he had loved "Sue" even when he broke-up with her, and that he still does love "Sue" even though he is with me.      Also, I've also noticed that he hasn't been wearing his engagement ring (he got one to match mine) for nearly a month now. I never see him wearing it anymore, and he used to ALWAYS wear it no matter what. Could this be a hint towards something?      So what do I do about it? He's obviously still interested in "Sue", and is talking and seeing her (not particularly behind my back that I know of, but he's just never told me anything about their conversations. I had to find out on my own). Do I need to bring it up, or just leave it alone? This is deeply hurting me and driving me crazy. Please, if you have any good advice to hand over, let me know. And thank you so much.

20090220155005AARaLyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do  in my shoes?	Last november, I invited my best guy friend to Sadie's and he said yes. the week of Sadie's, I got bronchitis and never got the chance to tell him. So he finally texted me and asked me if i got the tickets. I replyed "yes I got the freaking ticket, forget that I've been sick" and then he went off. He said I was being bitchy, that my parents didn't want me and that's why I get nice things, and that I'm secretly in love with him (NOT). So I told him I didn't want to speak to him again. It's been four months since we've spoken and I wonder why he won't apoligize to me. Recently, he told a mutual friend that if I approached him and talked to him, he'd forgive me. I really want to be friends again because he was my best friend, but I have NOTHING to apologize for (I believe). If you were in my shoes, what would you do?

So on friday my friend told me that she liked "Jared", a ninth grader. He had been flirting with me online a little, but I didnt like him, and I told her that. Later that week (after a few chat sessions) I decided i liked him. I didnt want to tell her, so I kept inside myself. Today, she told me to tell him that she liked him, and he said he couldnt date her because she was a seventh grader. So am I. I know that my liking him at this point wouldn't make a difference, but is it important that he knows? Or would it just hurt my friend to know that I was keeping it from her?

Ok so I'm 11 and my "friend" is really annoying. 1 She says shut up more than i can count and ever since she started sitting with me and my friends at lunch every things changed everybody been getting in fights. She really nice when u meet her but then,.... Even if ur talking to someone else she'll just blurt out and say u talk to much its so annoying. As I talk to everyone else they say she is the same way. She thinks shes always right about everything and right now i think shes brain washing someone. Sometimes your friends with her and shes nice then u do one thing and she gets out of it. I was texting her and she said i had attitude when i was TEXTING. SO how could she tell which i didn't lol. So ya and shes the reason why are friend doesnt sit with us anymore. :( she is so aggravating! Oh and she cannot take a joke. I dont know what to do she can be nice sometimes but then other times its not pretty.

20090219185406AAGSPKn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems. Guys and Girls answers needed!?	Okay so this will be a little long.         There is this guy who we will call Kevin. He used to always make fun of my last name because it's the same name as a fish. Anyways he recently told me that he likes me and asked me out over text. I wanted him to ask me out in person but he said it wouldn't make a difference. He stopped texting me after that. Than in middle January I was still pissed he wasn't responding to me texts so I went to the mall and texted him on an Apple Phone and asked why he stopped texting me and he said it was because I was annoying. Then around February 10 he texted me and was like, "So, I'm assuming you don't like me anymore?" I said I didn't know. And now again he hasn't texted me for a week. We NEVER talk in person and it pisses me off SO much.       Just a little facts so you don't think I'm 10 or something: I'M 15!         So Girls: Do you think I should go out with him or forgive him or any other advice?      And Guys: What the hell is wrong with him, why is he acting like such a jackass?      Thanks to anyone who can help!

20090219184459AA1l7so	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Giving my ex her mail?	Alright haha so here goes the story i let my ex live with me for 6 months rent free so she could kinda get re-established and all that, then she broke up with me without giving me a reason and to this day still has not givin me one, i was heart broken for a while maybe even a lil  obsessive, but in the end i realized i just wanted to be friends. After contacting her the first time in 3 months we met and she told me she couldn't see me yet because it was too hard for her/ too soon, and could not even be my friend at this time even when i had explained to her i was in a shitty place and i could really use one.      So now i hold a lil bit of a grudge against her because all i did for her/ put up with but i still wanna be friends and have decided that if she wants to be friends she will have to contact me.       so i have an important piece of mail for her and im torn between calling her and telling her i have it and she should come and get it ( i feel like i have lost the battle by contacting her) or giving it to a mutual friend to give to her.      Sorry for the Poor poor poor punctuation

20090424063534AApDhNO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ex-girlfriend confusion....?	Me and my ex broke up two months ago. She led me on, then off, over and over again till I finally took notice. She used things to put me down to such a great extent that it made me want her back even more, making me feel worthless basically and bringing events up from 4 years ago. (we dated for 5). And i feel like everytime she gets angry I hear the same old thing she tries putting me down with because she has nothing new. Not even within the year. All it is was you treated me like **** and brings up stuff from years ago and blames me for EVERYTHING no matter what. Even when she cheated on me basically. So i finally took the blame off myself. Sent her an email cuz i wanted to prove i don't believe her BS anymore because she honestly made me believe a lot of it until i stopped loving her. I wasn't going to even send it but she was treating me like crap at work and school and realized she treated me exactly the same way when we were dating and not respecting me at all. Thinking she was so much better than everyone else. And I was mature, asked her not to respond cuz i know all she will do is put me down like usual. And She IMed me yelling at me how she has all these friends and people like her and i screwed up the relationship. (Just like I expected lol) Why is she being so immature about it and why didn't she just let go if she didn't care. She telling me she "officially hates" me and tried to put me down like usual. So to stop the bitching I said your right, your always right, See you tomorow. (In class) The next whole day in class and work she was trying to be crazy nice, the nicest she been since we broke up. And tried talking to me about stuff constantly and my life. I told her I wanted nothing to do with her so I didn't fully go into conversation and walked away a few times at work. Do you think she is just trying to suck me back in? Am I doing the right thing?

20090220121709AAAJlBs	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Non-traditional Wedding!?	Hi there,      I am getting married on July 3rd, 2009. We are getting married on the rooftop gardens of a hotel downtown. My fiance has a close family friend whom is a retired Catholic priest and we would like to ask him to preform a (very) short ceremony - (speech, vows, rings, done). We understand that our marriage won't be recognized by the Catholic church - no sacrament (no bother to us), but we were wondering if this is something that is possible (is the retired priest allowed to perform such a ceremony? -  would he act just as a Justice of the Peace?)       Anyone with a similar experience?      Thank you in advance for the help! :)
20090220152344AAmSD9t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she trying to not hurt my feeling or do you think it's the truth? *Girl's ideas favored?	When I asked out a girl I liked, she said she isn't allowed to date until she's 16 (she is 15 now). I can't figure out if that means she would like to 'cause she didn't directly say no, or if it was a lie to not hurt my feelings, or some other meaning. I really want to believe it was the truth and she does like me, but I can't read what it means. This is the first time I've ever asked a girl out in case you haven't guessed. I want to know so I can wait and ask again when she is older, but I don't want to make matters worse since I may have already lost her as a friend. In summary, love hurts.      The questions I want answered with detail if possible for the 10 points are:   1. Is this a common thing girls say to reject people nicely?   2. How should I talk to her the next time we see each other?   3. What other things do you think she means if any?      Any other help would be greatly appreciated!

20090220202511AAREtYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is she playing some kind of a game with me?	ok this is a bit long but bear with me      its this girl from school. was in my English class 2 semesters ago (about an year ago). this girl in class since day 1 she was staring at me and looking away when i look her way. she started to park her car near mine, and every time she seem me out side class she was smiling at me but i was too nervous so i acted like i never saw her. and few days i didn't have my first class so i took a little nap in my car and when i got out she got out too, but i walked real slow and she was ahead and keep looking back at me (this happen twice). also one day i had to give my cousin a ride to her work and back (she's my age) and just my luck at the traffic lights this girl was ahead me and she looked in my car real good and had a little mad look too but i acted like i never saw her. also i work at this store in the mall and every time she was there and passed by i saw her turning back and look at me.      and summer was up school was over i never made a move on her. she came into my store couple times first time i was at an isle stuffing the shelves and came took a box of clippers off the shelf looked at me real quick twice and left (it happen so fast) and the second time was the same came in looked at me and left).      when the fall semester started she transferred schools. so i added her on facebook was accepted immideatly then i sent her a message saying hi how she is doing but no reply till now.      i still work at the same place go to the same school.so during Christmas vaca she came to my work place one there were 3 registers open and she was in line and tried to come to mine letting other ppl go first but i closed mine and left coz i felt like a fool. and yesterday she came there again she walked bay looked at me and came back and bought a pack of gum, i was like what the heck so talked to her this was the first time i talked to her she was smiling the whole time talked for few minutes, laughed and she left.      so my question is does she like me if so why didnt she reply to my message. i liked this girl but she made me very nervous liek can't talk nervous thats y i ignored her but since i didnt do any thing i still kick my slef but coz of her my shyness went away also in that class i was pretty loud and used to joke around a lot along with my friends.      also the college i go to is near my house and her house is like 10miles form mine so chances are i will she her next summer should i make a move next time i see her

20090220205418AA5HPA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused about what boyfriend tells me?	I have been dating the same guy for a year and a half.  For the first nine months of our relationship, we had no issues whatsoever.  However, since that point we have fought somewhat (without breaking up).  I have been under the impression that we love one another, and I do love him, but lately he's been acting a little weird.      He gets frustrated with me and will tell me that he can't stand being around me and he wants to break up with me and he never thinks we will work.      However, he ALWAYS follows up with this either later the same day or the next day or two telling me that he loves me and he knows he's horrible to me and he's trying to get better.       We don't have a lot in common personality wise, but we do/did enjoy each other's company.  Normally, I'd just break up with him and be done, but we're expecting a baby in May, so the issue is a little more tricky.  Has anyone else ever had this happen to them?  I'm unsure of what he means, and would love a guy's perspective (or an experienced female's!).  What is the truth here?

20090220165240AAiO918	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a crush on my best guy friend?	Okay, well I have this friend named "Aaden" (not his name) and he's so nice. I love him so much he has the cutest smile. He's not actually hot but I am the type of girl who likes guys for their personalities. I have not once liked a really hot guy. I'm 13, and I'm afraid my best friend (who's a girl) will laugh at me if I like him because I've said I don't before. And he liked her once, and I guess that's when I started liking him because I felt jealous. But he's been appreciating me more than her lately, they have been fighting I guess so he's been giving me hugs and we have been getting closer. Should I tell him? Like most cases, I am afraid it will ruin our friendship.
20090220165443AAY5EuN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can i put this story in a title?	Im 18 and was a playa before i met this girl but shes the one shes 20 and has a fiancee who treats her like crap - hits her, takes her phone off her, stops her from leaving the house, stops her from doing what she wants, wont let her talk to other guys. She goes to work sometimes to avoid him. This guy though lives with her mum and has been with her for 6 years.      I asked her a month ago did she like me she said she didnt know. I asked if i had a chance she said not at the moment i then asked was it because of x she said yes.      We text everyday and if we dont the next two days she will be like you fallen of the planet or something, we meet up like once a week or whenever we get time. Ive told her i want her, i want to take her away from it, i want the best for her that i want her to be mine and that i get so worried and upset when he goes mental at her etc. We had a big argument and i told her never to text or talk to me again she said ok vice versa and go and fcuk yourself, anyways the other day she apoligised.      She hasnt told her bf that we are talking again as she said he'd skitz on her, what she doing? do i keep it up and never give up? Does she like me? Whats she thinking?
20090220165730AAozvcF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend gave my friend a topless massage in a bedroom and he thinks it's okay?	He's now my ex-boyfriend, but we're still good friends and I tease him about it sometimes. He still thinks he did nothing wrong. We were dating for six months, and he had told me that he was "in love" with me.      On a weekend I went away to a cottage with some friends, he went to a party at our mutual friend (Eric's) house. He and one of my female friends went upstairs into the spare bedroom, where she took off her top and he gave her a massage. That's all that he told me, but Eric claims that my ex bragged about sleeping with her that night.      Whether they did sleep together or not - Do you think it's okay for a taken male to go upstairs into a bedroom with his girlfriends friend, and give her a topless massage?

20090220182931AAzwabG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My heart feels broken...?	I can't remember the last time I cried   well...until yesterday..yesterday I cried my heart out for what seemed like hours...alone in private, of course...   I met a girl in my math class in September..6 months ago   and Ever since...she's been all I can think about...We got to know each other really well. Then, when id didn't "make a move" after three months she started dating a guy from another school...      I cried yesterday..I've broken my arm (in 3 places), I didn't cry...Had to get 15 stitches for a gash in my knee...I didn't cry. It takes a lot to make me cry... Yet, yesterday, when I cried...there were no broken bones, no leg with a half inch gash...      Over the past few months I've had this crushing pain...I'm depressed...I not going to deny it...and I swing between surly and melancholic (sad) all the time...it's been like this for months      She hugs me and for the first few seconds the pain stops...then...it comes back worse than ever and it is tortuous...last time she hugged me I told her to 'get lost'... She can't torture me like this..it's not fair... it hurts too much...   I don't know if she ever liked/likes me...I don't know if she knows why I told her to "get lost"...can't she see it hurts..don't girls "get" these things?         ANYWAY, I'm REALLY depressed...and have been this way for months...help?

20090220212055AAihLXD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I let this ladyboy know Im not interested?	Ok so I have a website where I have all kinds of members, and its mostly asians so I have alot of thais and filipinos on there. Well in Thailand and Philippines theres lots of ladyboys, so I wanted them to feel welcome so I wanted a section just for them since men and women both have a section. So in Thailand they prefer to be called ladyboys, but I didnt know about philippines. So I asked this ladyboy what they prefer to be called and told her/him that they were beautiful (Im not looking to hook up or anything though) and I think the ladyboy thinks I was hitting on him/her. How do I let them know Im not interested without being offensive or hurting his/her feelings? If I just come out and say "Im not interested" or hint to that, then it looks like Im full of myself with a big ego and will probably offend them because it makes them look like they are desperate and hitting on everyone or something. I do think they are desperate a little, but I dont blame them, because they are guys but look like women, so it must be tough, because straight guys dont want them because they are really guys, but gay guys dont want them either because they look like women.
20090220225000AAssuHk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Are virgin men a turnoff?	This is especially for women that have had sex. Would you want to date a guy that is planning to stay a virgin until he's in a very serious relationship, or possibly even marriage? I'm a good looking guy, 6'7" 245 lbs muscular/toned build, black hair blue eyes. I'm extremely smart and nice too. It just seems like all the girls I meet are just looking for one night stands or short flings, when I'm not like that at all. I've had drunk girls try to come back to my place more than once but I don't want to have sex until I'm in love with the girl. I want to find a girl that's looking for something serious, but it's hard to find. So if your a girl that's had sex before would a guy like me be a turnoff?

I dont dress skimpy and I dont act sl*tty, i just talk about stuff like that around guys.

20090220203221AAKWy6Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Relationship stressing me out, what should i do about boyfriend?	So i have been with my boyfriend for about 8 months now, including the time we were dating/talking and we are very much in love. However, i feel like i'm having big problems with him. We used to go to the same school, we're were on the same sports team. he'd walk me to class, walk me home after practice so we'd see each other all the time. However, he just recently transferred to a school that can help him further his future in sports and i can only see him on the weekends. He's parents are extremely strict and don't allow him to go out or talking on the phone at ALL. when we go on dates or want to hang out he has to either lie or sneak out the house like we're little kids, mind you we're both juniors in high school. . He doesn't have a cell phone, he keeps saying he ordered the sim card but it never came in. his parents dont allow him to use the house phone, he used to sneak it for a few minutes on occasion, but since his dad been working at home lately, he can't. we went out on valentines day. he got home at 5 o clock in the afternoon and he got GROUNDED....thwe havent talked in a whole week, no emails, no calls. nothing. when he finally calls me, he'll say its because of his dad watching the phone everyminute, i believe'cause his sister, who goes the same school as i, complains about it too. this happened about two weeks ago as well. im really just sick and tired of it . i mean i love him so very much,i know he loves me too, and i know if we are in love it shouldnt matter but it does. am i wrong for feeling like this?? what would you do in my position? [and please don't tell me try to talk to his parents because they would KILL him if they found out he has a girlfriend...thats out of the questiion]. PLEASE HELP!
20090220203655AAHGhL3	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think she faked her orgasm?	(serious answers only, please)      So i had known going into this relationship that she had never been able to orgasm during sex, whether it was with males or females.      Last night, we had sex for the first time, and I gave her Oral (I am a female). About 15 minutes after, she "orgasmed" and then said something along the lines of "you are the first person to get me off orally- It took a while but it worked!."       But i thought back to what she had said previously, and i wonder if she faked it? After she was "done", it was my "turn" and she got 3 orgasms out of me very easily, and i felt guilty :P      Our communication is good, and we are honest, but I don't know what to do about it- I would feel rotten if I continued the same technique i was using and it wasn't getting her off.      Part of me thinks she did it to make me more confident and feel better about myself as a partner.      Ideas?

So reasons why and why not   He does?   1.) My friends were teasing him that he liked my friend and he said if he did he wouldn't sit next to her, then I sat next to him and he moved.   2.) I asked him if he liked a different friend of mine and he made sure I knew he didn't Ex. "we're not in 2nd grade when I say I don't like someone I don't!"   3.) He makes or pokes fun at almost all the girls except me   He Doesn't?   1.) he has sat next to me   2.) A girl he was rumored to like asked him to sit next to her and he did   3.) He doesn't ask me for help in L/A anymore but if I offer it he will accept.   4.) He's kinda popular and I'm not   So I don't know, and please don't tell me to ask him because when I asked if he liked my friend he said he'd rather kiss a toad, and if he said something that harsh to me I'd be really upset. If you think he does tell me how I can show him I like him without physical contact. Thank you!
20090220224730AA82j9f	Family & Relationships;Friends	Im really confused about this guy..?	So I was first introduced to this guy and at first i thought he was kinda sweet and interesting, but really flirty. And he kept giving me mixed signals! Like "I love youu!" or "lets get married!" or "why wont you let me kiss you" like out of nowhere...i thoguht it was relaly annoying and hed force me to say it back to him.. also he only says that kind of stuff online and not in real person. Then he always said "We're just friends, i dont like you like that."      Ok is that messed up or what?      Well thats what I thought. So one day, I just gave up on that little retard! He annoyed me too much and said wierd things...and caused alot of drama b/w me n my friend (long story). So I pretty much blocked him out of my life! Deleted him off myspace/facebook/contacts on my phone/ignored him for good....And ive been doing this for like a couple months now. But now whenever I see him he looks at me kinda sad..And it makes me feel bad.      But if he just wasnt so annoying! And my friend (who hates him) kind of convinced me to hate him, about all his flaws and stuff. And idk why, but whenever a guy friend tries to get closer to me, like relationship wise, i back away. I dont know why...its probably because ive watched too many movies and their just not 'perfect' but idk. I need to fix that :/ I just cant help it.       But thats also another reason why I sorta hate him.       A part of me still does hate him, but then another part really wants to talk to him again.       What should I do? I mean, now its all akward between us and I have a feeling he MIGHT have liked me..but now, probbaly not.       Ah...so confused      sorry this was so long and confusing!
20090220201632AAyLnvh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I get out of my relationship.?	Alright, I am 24 years old. I like my boyfriend, but when he talks about marriage it really freaks me out. I don't know if it is that I am not ready for marriage or if i don't want to be with him. I get a really uneasy feeling in my stomach when he talks about it, and I think about if I really want to spend the rest of our lives together. Part of it might be that fact that he is Catholic and I am Protestant and it is challenging to think of what we are going to do with our kids. Also, we are in an interracial relationship (white/hispanic), we receive so much crap about it frankly I am afraid to put up with it for the rest of my life. I worried that if I leave him, what if I never find anyone else and he was the "one." I'm scared if I stay with him I am going to want something more my entire life. Also, I am an extremely picky person, which I am trying hard not to be. If you think this is a result of me being picky, please let me know. Any advise would be great, thanks!

20090220224644AAmUwqc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Boy problems:should I tell him the truth or not?	I used to know this guy back when I was like 9 or 8 years old. We used to play in the same soccer team for like 3 years or more and his parents knew my parents soo..yeah. I wouldn't call him a friend cause we never really talked to each other much but we would hang out with a bunch of our other friends. But one day this guy I knew that was like waaayyy to much of a best friend with him told me that he liked me because he kept talking about how cute I was whenever I wasn't around. And I think my crush for him kind of grew more but I never really got to tell him how I really felt because then I moved. It's been about 3 years since I last spoke to him or even saw him and well my crush for him never went away even though I though it would because well I don't think he's the king of guy that cares too much about girls ( pays more attention to soccer) but I know for a fact he's been in some relationships. I have him as a friend on myspace and facebook, but we barely talk or anything. I'm not really the kind of girl that likes or care too much about guys (i'm only 14) but for some reason every time I try to make my crush for him go away it doesn't and well I don't know what to do. Should I confess to him or just let my crush fade away??         If you need a picture of him I could show you it.

20090220182348AAH1icV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problem keeping it up when I'm with the girl I like...?	Ok, to make a long story short, I had a crush on a girl about a year or so and nothing ever happened.  Once I gave up on her she ran into me at a bar and invivted me home with her.  Very cool.  That night I was wasted, so I couldn't really get it up, if you know what I"m saying.  Anyways, the next couple times the same thing happened, but I wasn't as drunk, so I don't really have an excuse.  Everything works just fine, but I am not able to perform for this girl, and I really like her so I'm feeling horrible about the whole situation.  I think I am putting a ton of pressure on myself to impress or satisfy her and consequently I'm psyching myself out or something.  Anyways, we're both frustrated and discouraged about the whole thing.  How do I fix this???????
20090220195540AAjSsIG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He dumped me after 6 days? Thats harsh.?	Okay the day before valentines day, he asked me out... then six days later he tells me that hes been doing a lot of thinking, and he rushed into things... and he made himself feel what he wanted to feel (love for me), but he doesn't like me anymore and wants to be Just friends. He seemed really sorry for hurting me. But why? He gave me 2 teddy bares a card, box of chocolates and a gold chain for Valentines day. It was very sweet, should i give him back his presents? Do you think he will start to like me again? Because al of a sudden, he dumps me when he has second thoughts, that seems pretty rash.   He didnt want sex, we spoke about it, and he said were not having sex until im ready... Im very confused.   Thanks

20090220185254AARv5Hz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do about this girl?	So there is this girl I'm interested in.   This is at school.   We don't know each other (kinda but not really)   She is junior and I'm a sophomore (i think that matters)   The thing is we don't have any lunch times together.   Or even classes.      I see her in the hallways every now and then, but there is always something that holds me back. (not me being shy or anything)   I'm not like shy or embarrassed to talk to girls   that is not my problem      what my problem is how do I get this girl in a situation to talk to her.   I could probably get a friend of hers to set it up. but I dont trust her, and I think she would screw it up.      so any suggestions or ideas on how to make this happen?
20090220175546AAHcbWC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problem with a girl I'm talking to?	Ok so me and this girl started talking about a month ago. Everything is good and we are really into eachother, and the chemistry is great. Except for today... She told me some girl was trying to hit on her over myspace but it's a girl that she knows. She said that she doesn't like this girl... but on her myspace comments it shows them talking all lovey dovey back and forth. I don't like to play games so I just asked her straight up what's going on with her and this girl. She said "When you realize that I'm not playing games with you then call me back." And then hung up on me. Is it even worth it to chase after her cuz I really like her or does it sound like I'm just setting myself up for heartbreak?

20090220195004AAGPuHI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Were just friends;; or am i wrong?	so i met this guy a few weeks ago and hes really nice and hes not my usual type. but lately idk if i should take it as just being firendly or as flirting. the one day he was throwing candy down my shirt and just like smiling and laughing. then since i was sitting on the inside of the booth he offed to throw out my garbage. then today it was kinda aquward cuz everyone was out of school besides me and him.. so we were sitting across from each other and we were talking and stuff. he teases me a lot and makes me laugh, then i needed to make a copy on the copy machine and he paid for it. he also has a habit of saying goodbye to me when we walk to our different classes. usually its something like "good luck" or "see you _____" or "have fun." and my other friend, just kinda leaves and doesnt say anything like that. so idk .. i think it may be too early to tell but i wanna have some kinda feel on the situation before i decide to do anything.       so what do you guys think, does he like me? too soon to tell?            btw:: i dont wanna ask him yet. im just trying to get a feel on the situation.      p.s. he said that its the least he could do for me cuz i didnt know that there was a copier and he did. i was also pressed for time .. so thats why he said that. and he also does that thing, where he looks at me till i look and then he looks away- especially when my other 2 friends are around us.

20090220173743AAoXc8Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would U Take It As An Insult If A Guy Didn't Want To Sleep with u?	Just say u met a man, and he has this strong moral, that he shouldn't take a woman's virginity or have sex with her before they marriage, because he don't want her to loose anything to him, just in case things don't work out and they end up breaking up. Therefore, he's a sensitive fella.       Would U think it's an insult? or consider urself a lucky girl?

For the past few weeks a girl who's sat next to me has looked at me a lot, sort of longingly almost (as if she wanted me to talk to her) ... I was too busy talking with my other friend and working on homework, so I didn't pay her much attention; that and I was a bit too shy to initiate convo because she's a pretty cute girl and I don't fare well in awkward situations (who does, lol)...      Anyway I was planning on actually trying to get to know her better this week, but she wasn't displaying the normal signs that she's at least curious about me. She didn't stare at all (and we sit next to each other), so I'm a bit flustered. Perhaps she's simply a nervous girl in general and didn't actually think anything of me? I'm so confused, girls drive me nuts !

Ok, well, about three months ago, I met this guy, Nathaniel, and we've hung out a TON since then... Like, a LOT. He's very emotional and metro... a lot of people think he's gay because of some of his mannerisms and how he's into fashion, but he's straight. I think he's very emotional because of his past... he lost both of his parents at a young age... awful deaths, too... I won't get into that... he's been in foster care, and never had a stable home. He's moved from place to place. Anyways, he's one of those guys who's really into hugging and stuff. I love that, because I can just go running up to him in the hall and throw myself into his arms and hug him, just because I know he'll hug me back. He almost ALWAYS is hugging me or has his arms around me or something. I like him as a lot more than just a friend, and I think he might like me back, but anyways... He was living with this really nice foster family... they were thinking of adopting him, but he just told me today that he heard them saying they might not adopt him after all... they can't afford another kid during these hard times, or whatever... But he's SUCH a nice person... one of the nicest people you'll ever meet... and he's a junior, and soon he won't be able to be legally adopted anymore. He's never had a regular family... he's lived with grandparents and foster families... I feel so bad for him, because he was SO excited that someone wanted to adopt him, and he loves the family... I can't imagine giving up someone like him... I mean, I know times are hard, but when I look at him when he's upset, I don't know how anyone could turn him away... I don't know what to do, or if there even IS anything I can do, other than be his friend... but is there anything I could do?! Please, please just help me... just give me opinions, advice... I don't know... just, please?

20090220183154AAWF3TE	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I DO?! I've known her forever, and she's just 13!!?	Ok, well, I have this friend who's 13, and she's in eighth grade (I'm a sophomore, and 15.) and she has a boyfriend (he's 14, and stayed back). They started dating back in the spring, but she was 12 (they started dating like, 4 days before she turned 13). Well, first, she told me that they make out in a classroom everyday after school before they go to practice with their teams for sports. Then, once, she was (rudely) IMing him when I was at her house (and ignoring me) and I saw him saying something about "I was about to unbutton your shirt and the teacher came in." and I was sitting there thinking "Oh My God, she's only 13."I mean, I'm 2 years older and I wouldn't do that... And then a couple days ago, she told me that she's given him a handjob (in a very braggy tone.) I'm like, "Oh my God, what's next, sex?" and she's a Christian... her family is all Christian and I'm pretty sure they don't agree with sex before marriage. I've known her FOREVER and I never thought she'd be like this... I just don't want to end up with a 13 year old, pregnant friend... what should I do? I know it's not my business, but it's really bothering me... I mean, she's only 13, and she's given him a handjob... she's not even in high school yet! I don't know what to do? And I try to tell her this, she'll laugh at me and think I'm like a "mom" or something, and boring, or something... you know? I just don't know what to do!      Oh also, I'm a Christian, too, if that matters. I don't personally know her boyfriend, but I hear enough about him (*eye roll* EVERY conversation... @_@). Supposedly he's a Christian too, but I mean, what I think he's aiming for doesn't seem too Christian to me.

(AND NO I WASNT PURSUING HIM NOR DID I TRY TO BE WITH HIM, IT JUST HAPPENED. HE PURSUED ME!!) after the kiss, he dissappeared, ignored me completely and stopped talking to me. after two months of silence, he apologizes and says that he was scared of his feelings that grew and wants to go back to being friends. i was cool with that because i valued his friendship more than anything. i text him and we will have a good convo and then out the blue, he will just stop without saying bye. but when i dont text him he asks me why i dont text, and tells me to call him sometimes. and when i call, i never get an answer. i asked him if he feels awkward and he assured me that everything was cool. he called me once but it seems like im always the one texting and calling and sometimes when i do text him, he doesnt answer. what should i do?

20090220212705AADMNHg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do guys (preferably ages 14-16) always go for the easy/slutty girls?	I'm totally serious- this isn't a joke.

Some people think light hair is beautiful and others think dark hair is beautiful. Some people think that tan skin is beautiful and others think that fair skin is beautiful. Some people think that being thin is beautiful and others think that being curvy and voluptuous is beautiful.

20090220190357AAhoWFs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he might like me or be interested?	Ok i'm sorry if this is long but i have a question and some detail to back it up...   So i am in the seventh grade and there is this eighth grader that i like. He does track and i do soccer. So we were out there and i've noticed he's sometimes looked at me with his group of friends, but i never was sure. We had a dance tonight and one of my friends on my soccer team is "homies" (Yes how immature) with his friends and anyway i thought maybe that he was looking at her. The only thing was he is really quiet and shy. He didn't dance really innapropriately with my friend when all his other friends were. He was off to the side. I was more off to the side too but also with other friends. At the end of the dance we were outside and i was sitting quietly, us three girls lined in front of like the six guys, and i was looking down and when i looked up i notice he was looking at me and he looked away. He is really quiet and i don't know if he was just looking to see what i looked like, seeing if i was the same girl from soccer, or something else...   Please tell me your opinion and i don't mind if you say anything like that doesn't show that he likes you, just tell me ways to communicate with him, i'm shy and don't have a chance to talk to him, only by hanging out with my "friend".    If i hadn't switched gym periods i would be with him...   LOL   Please help and nothing mean.   Best answer gets 10 points

20090220175451AAZJDtc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I wrong for thinking this?	My best friend said that I was wrong for thinking this, because I said I would never date a guy who didn't treat me like a princess. I know chivalry is not TOTALLY dead. I'm a total romantic, and I love it when guys do things such as open doors, and stand up when you leave the room.    Like, they wouldn't have to do those things all the time, but it would be nice if they did it every now and then. But I think that if they don't think I'm wonderful enough to treat me like a princess, they're not worth my time...   Am I wrong for not dating a guy if he doesn't treat me like a princess?

20090220183223AA945yS	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do I have a right to be mad and kinda jealous of this girl?	When my boyfriend told me he didn't love me anymore and ended it with me 2 months back, I suspected it was because he liked another girl, Yasmin. I was right. They were going out soon after. Even though we had split up, I still wanted him to be happy, even if it was with someone else, I felt like I would be atleast a bit happy if he was with someone who deserved him. This girl Yasmin is admitedly stunning. She turns heads everywhere she goes, and is so nice to everyone. Only, she cheated on my ex (he dumped her when he found out) and she got herself a new boyfriend soon after looking like she had no care in the world. I felt so angry that she could do that - and I haven't told anyone. Do I have a right to be mad and kinda jealous of this girl? I really can't get over him...  :(

20090220203745AAeaWyP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How could he leave me so fast?	Recently my boyfriend of 3 months broke up with me. We'd been having a rough spot and I told him I needed some space and he went and met another girl on me. I had no idea but hed been seeing her behind my back for a month. He dropped me like a bad habbit with no regrets. No idea how he could do it! How do I make him regret it??!?! and get my strength back?? I've lost 10 pounds over him....and I feel like I was deeply in love. I woulda married him, if he wasnt such an asshole....what if he tries to ever call me again? what would I say?or do? I was warned about him on our first date that he never settles for long..but things seemed to be going well..now hes with this other girl and I have no idea why. Sure things were going in the hole with us but that was cuz of him...I knew that things probly wouldnt get better with us but I thought we could at least be friends, and he wouldnt move on SO FAST!!!!??!?!?Do u think I'll ever hear from him again? (oh on top of this i heard hes trying to get back with his ex gf of 4 years, while hes dating this other girl).  They broke up because he was constantly cheating on her.  I just dont want to have lost him forever u know, I knew him so well...but he was probly lucky to have known me..Do people like that feel?? And if not, then why???  He was so back and forth with us..but things really did start getting rocky, and I told him that I didn't like how he was treating me....and then he went and found someone else...when I got tired of his crap.  I was still sort of trying for more though or to fix things..but he already had someone on the back burner....maybe someone that worshipped him...

20090220175214AAZ3hPq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	LADIES: please answer!?	So i met a girl A at the gym. She has a boyfriend but said that i should meet her friend girl B (i didnt ask her out or anything, we're just friends). So I friended girl B on facebook, and we messaged each other back and forth a few times. I eventually got her number said id call her. That was yesterday. So tonight i went in the gym to work out and talked to Girl A. She mentioned Girl B's name but didnt ask if we had talked or anything. So i said I got Girl B's number, and girl A said oh really? I havent talked to her. So we didnt mention it after that except i joked that girl B was gonna buy me dinner.      So when GIRL A talks to GIRL B (theyre like good friends), will girl B's interest go down or up? We have never talked on the phone or met in person, will this UP her curiousity about me or lower it since i said she gave me her number.

20090220181911AAt4wta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Ok guys, so i broke up with this girl for lying to me that she was a virgin and knowing that she has been out?	with ten guys. I found out that what she does is that she plays innocent and later and deep inside knows what she has done. Its been like 3 weeks, and she continues to park in the same spot as me, she laughs loudly somewhat when im around. On top of that all of a sudden she starts to talk to one of her friends who hangs out in the same spot as i do???? Its as if she keeps stalking me or something, but i dont pay any attention to her. Now i think i saw another guy/one of my friends kiss her? and later found out their going on a date? is she doing this to make me jealous or ishe just really a slut?

20090220202224AATu5WX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I can't stop bedwetting and I'm in college.?	I'm extremely reluctant to even ask this but here it goes. I'm 20 years old, in college, and i am paranoid to have girls stay the night with me because i have had bedwetting issues since i was young. It seriously only happens like 2 or 3 times every two weeks. I could take a chance that i wouldn't pee the bed with her in it but if i did i would never want to see daylight again. I've seen a psychologist, doctor, etc. I've never been abused so that has nothing to do with it either. Does anyone have any suggestions?

20090220191040AADrZyR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you think he likes me - yes,, no?	I already asked this question earlier today but no one answered so....         Okay well there is this guy in my social studies class right? He sits right next to me, to the right. He talks to me a lot, and sometimes he pretends not to be looking at me but obviously is, and I pretend like I don't see. I don't know why I guess I'm just shy,,, well I am around cute guys hahh anywho... there is this kid in front of me and you have to know this kid to know why he does this but whenever some girl sits behind him he'll develop this like fake crush on you, and always act all mushy towards you (this is not the same guy as I am wondering who likes me.) But the one that I like is the one that sits to my right, the guy I am wondering if likes me too. Well he always says things like Jake likes you.. (Jake is the kid who sits in front of me) and always tells Jake things to do to try and get me to like him, or things to do that will make me happy..? Yea I told him he was a dirty boy for that, but thats just what all 8th grade boys do. And today we got our class selection sheets for 9th grade so he was like what did you get? and took my sheet to see what classes I had next year and was like ohhh honors science? and I was just like ha.. yup. and then he turned around the sort of face me while reading the course description booklet...       I don't really know what these examples might sound like to you guys reading.. but hmm what do you think?

20090220172246AAUBopX	Family & Relationships;Friends	Was I being a bad friend?????	A couple of months ago my best friend got asked out by a guy named Daniel. I knew about Daniel's history. Daniel was and still is a total player. He kisses a girl then dumps them. He has more than 2 girlfriends at once. Well my bestfriend said she would go out with him. I told her about Daniel's history but she didn't care. I told her not to go out with him because is bad news. She said I was being a bad friend because I didn't want her to have a boyfriend. But really, I was trying to protect her from getting hurt. Well Daniel broke up with my friend in only a week. He kissed my friend then dumped her. So I was right. If she listened to me she would've saved up all those tears. I got really angry when she called me a bad friend because all I was doing was saving her from getting hurt! Was I really being a bad friend???

20090220181628AAM4kO4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he like me back? Maybe he does this with all the girls, but I don't know.?	At prom night, people were dancing and stuff and my crush was dancing too. But I didn't dance till the second hour since I felt dizzy. So, I only got to dance with him a little cause he said his feet hurt from dancing in the first hour. But I saw him slow dancing with my best friend/old classmate, but I think he danced with her cause he's the one who invited her to go (I was supposed to, but I used up my plus 1) Then, I slow danced with my ex boyfriend since, I wanna talk and just be nice. Then I saw my crush sitting on stage, and I sat on stage too and hugged him from behind and he was holding my hand, the hand near his chest.      and he asked me      "How was your dance with *him (ex boyfriend)?"      "It was..err... OK..It doesn't feel right anymore"      and he said "It looked Hott!"      and I said while rubbing my cheek on his shoulder "Yeah, but it doesn't feel right"      I held his hand a bunch of other times that night like he'd squeeze it a little and he'd loosen his grip but still enough grip to hold my hand, and when I danced with him he said "You should've asked me to dance earlier!" then, I didn't want his feet to get hurt more, so I let him sit down. :)

20090220201745AAixdJz	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I know if he's into me?	My best friend is the man of my dreams, but I'm too old fashioned to make the first move. Also, it's been going around classes that he likes my other friend, who's a real brat. She punches him, and tries to be with him at all times and thinks that I'm a threat to their "relationship", and that i can't be around him. Her buddy info on AIM is something she hopes he says to her, she made it up. It's something like this...      The moment I saw you I stopped...It was love at first sight! Ever since then i cant keep my eyes off you. We were meant to be...you and me.   I never want you to leave my side. When I go to Germany I will miss you so much. Im gonna need to hear your voice and see your face....we'll be able to talk on aim but it wont be the same.      I can tell she's so desperate, and he is always really nice to me, because i had trouble in the beginning of the year opening my locker(heh.) and he would always offer help. he stands next to me in line and is really nice just all over. He carries my books for me sometimes, too. And that girl is a real jerk to him, she hits him and laughs at him and makes fun of him and kicks him and steals his things. Why would he like her? Can someone tell me if I'm imagining things, or does it seem like he likes me?

20090220181057AAVgh5Y	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	(10 easy points for best answer) Girls would you understand this or do you agree with her?	Alright so me and my girlfriend are incredibly attracted to each other, and truly in love. But sometimes during our first go at sex I go really fast, and I can't really help it.      But I always end up making up for it, but yesterday she actually got mad at me, maybe its because it only lasted a couple minutes and then I went all over her.      But the second time was amazing, so good she had to give up she was way to tried to go anymore. So my question is, can going early really be a reason to get mad at your boyfriend... its not really in my control.      What do you girls make of this? I'm 19 shes 16, she was acting like she was never going to have sex with me again, and then 10 minutes later ripped my pants off.

I only have a twin bed, but it wouldn't matter because even when sleeping in a king size bed she has to be right next to me.

It never works out that way, but it isn't like I can just tell her to go home or get off of me... or can I?

20090220191435AATwsqI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do in a situation like this?	Ok so I met this girl online and I've been talking to her for about a couple weeks now she seems like a pretty nice girl and stuff and I really enjoy talking to her. From what I understand from past experiences you have to take things slow. I asked this girl to hang out just so I can get to know her a little bit more. Her response was sure she wouldn't mind and I was glad. Since this is the first time hanging out and I don't want to come on too strong where would you take her? Also I don't want her to think it's a date so how do I go about saying that it isn't. I'm sure that it wouldn't work out too well with her if it was a date since it's the first time. Should I hang out with just her or tell her to bring a friend and I bring one? I appreciate any kind of help you give me.

However, I believe something changed while being with a woman for a few years.  It's been 4 years since that relationship and I'm ready to date again, but haven't had much luck.  I have a first date tomorrow with a lovely lady, but could use some advice.  we are having dinner in a low key restaurant and hope to share some laughs, but any tips and advice on what to say and do would be greatly appreciated.      Thank you in advance.
20090220205907AAD7KSD	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it wrong to ask a woman to cater to a clothing fetish?	I'm a leg man, and I absolutely LOVE when a woman wears tights, nylons and especially thigh high stockings.  The woman I am interested in says that stockings are gross, and she will never wear them.  I teased her to keep the conversation going, and she grew irritated.  is it wrong for me to try to persuade her to wear them later on, when she has cooled off?  How can I talk her into it and make her feel better about it?
20090220194015AA9aEfb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does this sound like a friend thing or more?	Ok. A couple years aao, this girl I liked said she liked me, but saw me as someone she would settle down with and wasnt ready to settle down yet. This last few weeks, weve been talking a good bit. I told her I wanted to see the movie My Bloody valentine. She claims her friends tried to take her to see it, but she told them to choose another so me and her could go, which we did. She told me she was putting the ticket in a scrapbook, but not in a roundabout way, just flatout told me.       I sent her flowers for Vday, and a couple nights later, out of nowhere she sent a message saying that they are still very beautiful and wishes she left them at work so more people could see them. She asked if I was off Vday, ,but it didnt click in my head to ask her. So I asked her out on Vday, and she said she had to work and forgot I was off.      A couple weeks before that, she said shed loved to go out to eat with just me and my parents when I asked her. And she did, and she got along great with them, she talked first, joined in on embarrassing stuff about me, yada yada yada lol.       Whats the deal here? Friendship or possibly more? Some sound good but some sound against me!

So last night we were all at one of our friends house and Joey and Danielle came in now i couldn't get up and say hi or whatever because one of my friends was laying on top of me (long story) anyway he hugs her and grabs my face and gives me this huge kiss on the cheek meanwhile Danielle is standing right there. Anyway throughout the night he kept flirting with me now I don't know I dont want her to get hurt because she is like one of my best friends, so I don't know if i should tell her about this, he is also flirting with other girls he is also flirting with my friend erica and me erica and danielle are all like best friends so me and erica dont know if we should tell her or better yet say it to her. Also when they started going out Joey kept on tellind Danielle that me and erica and were jealous of them going out when honestly i could really care less but anyway; one of Joeys friends Chris told me that Joey likes me a lot and I was just going out with Danielle to make me jealous.

I took her on a date the day before she broke up with me. We went to the park and had a good time, so I thought. Then I took her to my house. She asked to play my xbox, and I said sure go ahead. Then I went to the bathroom, when I came out she was trying to play grand theft auto 4. She selected new game and save over my file which I worked so hard on. So I ran over and slapped her kind of hard. Lucky for me I saved my file. She began to cry and I asked for sex and began to feel her up. She ran out crying. I think it was maybe I was coming on to strong.

Me and my girlfriend were out on our 8th date and we were having a blast. She said she had never been so happy and I was also very happy. We went back to her place and we got naked, but we did not have sex yet. She said she had to use the bathroom so I waited and fell asleep. I woke up 5 minutes later and her dog was having his way with my butt-hole. She then came out of the bathroom and began to cry and screamed "Why would you cheat on me?" She then ran out of her house.

Its just like another question i asked if some of you see this familiar. But heres my problem now:      The saturday before valentines day, me and my boyfriend did some sexual things. We always do, but this day was different. While me and my boyfriend were making out, 30 minutes into it, i got this insane urge that was out of this world! It hit me, and the next thing i knew, i was begging him to have sex with me. Then out of nowhere he flips me over on my back. He didn't, just teased me. But we did some other things.      Now ever since that day, that whole moment plays back in my mind.  I just want him to do all kind of things to me now. I can't help it. even at school its hard to contain myself, and when we're alone, i play back everything in my mind at some how my body always manages to get close to his and i try to do things to him. my friends said i'm officially turned out and now all i'm gonna think about is sex. and i do! i can't get it out of my mind!  i actually have little daydreams about it! my friends even say i'm ''freaky''. I feel high off sex. I have this unbelievable want to have things done to me by my boyfriend like last time. I feel addicted to it. Am i addicted to my boyfriend? Am i addicted to sex itself?

I asked him why he dump me and he told me "I want only a real relationship and not long distance". Okay this may sound like I'm weak and pathetic, but I told him that nothing could make me hate him and that i still love him but he never say i love you back anymore..      Then he saw the comments on MySpace which was posted by my other ex like the guy i dated before him saying that he knows i am heartbroken right now and he is there for me as a friend..out of the blue he acted like he is mad and sent me a text message he was like "So I see you tricked another guy into falling in love with you...supposedly while we were together...or maybe we were not together but either way I see you moved on right after we broke up". I asked him what was he talking about, then he said "I saw your myspace". I told him Nick has been over even before I met and dated him. His reply was "Nick still loves you so I can't" I was like what the hell is the connection about nick loving me but he cant?!?      I love him more than anything else. Why does he act like he is jealous and yet he was the one who broke up with me and told me to leave him alone???? One day he told me "if you really want me to be happy then come and find me" but he wont make it easy for me, he said he would change his number and move to another house but he wont tell me where...i am really hurting right now. why do guys do that???

20090220181826AANqVR7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My gf fell in love with someone else. This is a long story?	Okay well it has been maybe a few weeks ever since she has broken up with me. At first I was a complete wreck ready to kill myself because we have a long distance relationship for 2 years. But she was always friends with this other guy who was older then me. So she told me from the beginning that she was pretending to be this guys gf because they accidentally got together as being in a long distance relationship, but my gf got confused and so it was all a big misunderstanding between them two. Over the past 2 years we have shared so many loving moments over the phone, kisses on the phone, gifts sending, emails, etc. And then recently that guy she talked to told her if she would come over to where he lives so they can finally meet. She told me she was always in love with him and was also in love with me, but the way I saw it was that she was slowly falling out of love with me. So she went over there to meet him and from then on everything changed and she fell in love with him. She slept in bed with him, had the urge to do it with him, and didn't even tell me she was there until she came back from her trip. She completely lied to me. Now don't get this the wrong way like she is a bit** or something because this is a very long story and you need to understand it all before jumping to judging people. She says she still wants to be friends with me, but I'm confused... Sometimes she acts like she is in love with me sometimes she doesn't. And I just don't know how to get over this feeling.. she is my first love and I just don't know to get over this. We have agreed to meet within 2 years from now because of some problems I can't explain.. it'll take too long.( I'm writing enough already.. sorry if you're bored..). So basically she fell in love with this other guy when she met him and I want to know is it really love that they have or is it just that they're use to being with one another. What is true love anyways? Sometimes she thinks she and me have true love because we get so along and I'm so caring and sensitive to her, but she claims that he has this strong grip on her and she can't stop loving him for some reason. I just don't know what to do. It seems so hopeless for me and her to be together.. should I just move on. Keep in mind she is my first love and she's the first to ever give me attention at all. It's hard enough accepting us as friends and I just want so much more from her. She says that she and him get along sometimes and sometimes not. Do you think that me and her will ever get to be together again one day as bf and gf?? I'm just so confused and shocked because me and her have shared so many things, so many many things you can't even imagine, but yet she chooses him for some reason. I am her second real love or could be him.. IDK.. Please help I'm confused at the moment who she is in love with and how she could just break up with me like that after all we been through.

20090220180149AArrUkf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do my bf is taking another girl to the dance?	okay so i was talking to one of my boyfriends friends and he told me he was goin to the dance with another girl and i was like umm what? and he said just as friends. so i was like w.e but then my friends said if he doesnt tell you soon then you should break up with him but i really like him but hes some what lieing to me. so idk. but then i was with him and a bunch of friends and they were like so who are you going to the dance with and he said no one and then people texted him and asked and he said no one but then today one of my friends asked the girl that he was gonna go with and she said they were goin together. so i know for a fact they are going together but i dont understand why he wont tell me. i wouldnt get mad because i cant even go to the dance and she has a bf. so idk why he made such a big deal to keep it from me and he still doesnt know that i know that they are going together. so he should just tell me because im really pissed just because he wont tell me so it would be much easier if he did.so what should i do? talk to him,forget about it, or break up with him for lieing?

20090220171027AA1Re2V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELP it's a life or death situation! :(?	Sorry, i just needed people to look at my question...but here goes...      Face it, my dog is dying. He is really really sick and he went from 15 pounds to 11 pounds and he's just not himself at all. So to brighten things up, if he passes away my mom says I can get a bunny. I would LOVE a bunny, but my dad thinks that it's wrong for bunnies to be kept in cages. I told him I'd take her out and play with it, but he won't listen. How can I convince my dad?
20090220210612AAv2zft	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	DUDE, GUYS ARE DOUCHE BAGS?	okay lemme make this shortish?      So there's this guy, named Joseph. i first met him from my original homecoming date, then my homecoming date asked me out,    i rejected him, then Joseph just started talking to me about my homecoming date, etc. then i get a text from Joseph, talking about how he liked me, then we talked for a couple of days, he asked me out & to homecoming, I dated him like 5 months ago, broke up for a dumb reason (people said he got made fun of for dating me), i found out that my original homecoming was making up lies so that i would like the Joseph, then we went back out (me and the guy), broke up for another dumb reason (he thought i didn't like him), see while me and Joseph were dating, he told me songs he was trying to work on(singing), well after we broke up he still told me some songs still,   then we like broke all contact, which was really depressing to me,   after homecoming, my friend put this hear in his locker, said was from me, and i had to get it before he saw it, so i went to his locker and said oh uh.. i looked down and it was on the floor, i put my foot on it and slid away.. he was like thanks for the love note? i was like huh yea no that was from brittney, and he was like well i have a new girl friend.. i was said well good for you. he dated this one girl... for awhile,   then my friend told him that i cheated.. he said well so did i! and my other friend told me no, hes lying. i text him a couple of weeks later and said.. i didn't really.. cheat. Then i was all upset cause i didn't think he likes me. Went to a football game, and im like im MOVING ON FOR GOOD. But, then my friend Ryan said no Sarah! don't, Joseph still likes you. im said no no hes done with me, well the next morning he texts me and says will you go out with me? i was dumb, and took my sweet time answering, and by the time i was going to say yes, he got too frustrated. so months past, of him ignoring me, and not even looking at me. then out of no where, he starts looking at me again, and noticing me. i dyed my hair (like one shade below my normal shade which isn't a big difference), and he noticed! (end of January) now he's kinda just been looking at me more, what can i do to get him back? and no its not as simple as talking to him.    i could go to his wrestling match?      sorry about the length XD i just need help!         and oh yes, im probably just being a little girl with a crush about all this.       btw, were both freshman in high school.
20090220170356AA3DzP4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What can I do I never want to see him again?	A year ago, I went to this weird private school school, and I started socializing with the people there. For some reason, I started texting this guy like crazy about 300 texts a day. Just as friends, but later he started getting to me. He wasn't even hot. Somehow, I started liking him. Plus, he is black and I'm Hispanic. We even kissed, which is unlike me. I was only 13 now 15. For some circumstances I had to leave the school in the middle of the year, and it was manly because of him and him being black. My parents saw that I was getting way too close to him, and i switched schools. I didn't want to at that time, but now I'm very happy i left. Lately, I have seen him like 2 times and his family. I'm always scared to see him, i don't want to. I have a phobia about seeing him. I don't know how he would react if he'd see me he's about 18 now. He's picture is just a nightmare to me now. What can I do I am scared that my parents will find out that was closer to him than they thought I was? What can i do I never want to see him ever again?

20090220171916AAiplD7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GIRLS: PLEASE HELP ME!!l!!?	Im 20, Peruvian (latino) and Guyanese (indian) and go to GSU where Im getting a degree in Physics and Psychology. Last semester in my Abnormal class there was this cute white girl, Valerie, a Psych major. She let me borrow her pencil once for a test, she said "U better bring back my pen, no one ever returns my stuff"- she never returned to class except for the Final. I sent her a message on this fake MySpace page and said "Aren't you in Abn Psych? Are you Peruvian, what a surprise?" (she went to Peru with 2 guy friends this summer). She wrote "Im still in, I just never go, he he". Then the day of the final she kept looking up smiling at me. Then this semester she is in my class again T & TH at 9:30-10:45 am. She looks at me alot during every class; I'll randomly be looking at the teacher, move my eyes and she'll be looking at me. I was in a hurry once to get to my next class this semester and accidently closed the door right behind me, where she was sort of waiting behind a bit awkwardly; I think she was giving me an opening. Then yesterday as I left the class she left first, left the door open for me and the girl ahead of me, i was going to say hi but then she whipped her cell out and started talking- during that class too I sat to where she usually sits and she sat a bit further away. What should I do? I think I've waited too long now....What should I do to communicate interest in her

You don't even know how many times I've joked around agreeing to their perverted questions like hooking up with them and having sex and all. I say yeah sarcastically and they are smart enough to know I'm joking.       Today in computers the power went out and it was dark in the room. The one who does the most to me of course sits right next to me but he got up for a sex and another one sat down next to me and was like "hey carly the lights are out..." and he grabbed the leg of my chair be pulled me towards him really hard! I couldn't fight back cuz he's like 10 times my size so I just like jumped up.       Then when the power was back the kid who usually site next to me was drawing disturbing pictures of me an him in a meadow and on a boat on paint.       I don't know why they do this to me. I'm not a **** but I'm not a reject either and I'm the only one they do it to! I just wanna know why and what I should do...

20090220165154AAeqXiR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Sooo, why do guys talk dirty? Does it mean anything if they do?	My best guy friend has been doing it a lot lately. Like inappropriate convos and topics. Yesterday when we were talking, he said he was bored and was having an erection. There were many other dirty convos like this. He is never too inappropriate with me, but just in general more so. He's a really nice guy, but why is he being so dirty lately? We've been best friends for 3 years. In fact, he just got a girlfriend 3 months ago. Ever since then, he has been talking dirtier. I always kinda liked him, and when he started dating this other girl, it really sucked. But I just don't know what his behavior means...
20090220170049AAjrrrj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I text him now or not? we talked a lot yesterday as it is...?	My best guy friend and I have been having a few arguments ever since he got a girlfriend 3 months ago. Him and I were always a lil into each other. I liked him a lot, and the way things were going, it seemed he liked me a lot too. So it was clearly a surprise to everyone when he started dating her. We have remained close friends though. Right now, we are long distance friends. The last week, he has barely contacted me. And yesterday we talked for about 4 hours, during which time one of our mutual friends was telling us how she was fed up with her bf as he never makes an effort to contact her. Ironic I know! So I told him I agree with her, and if I had to do all the work in a relationship, I would get sick of it. He texted me late last night. He said how he just wanted me to know that he has a few girls he is KINDA friends with, but 1 or 2 he would consider a best friend, and that I am one of them. It was very sweet. We texted for about an hour, and then I ended the convo. Well, I just don't know if texting him today is going to be toooo much if we talked so much yesterday AND it is a friday night. Maybe he is spending it with his gf? Should I text now or no?
20090220171111AAFuZzl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My guy friend is insanely curious about everything, except when it comes to other guys...?	He has been my best friend for 3 years. We talk about literally everything, except other guys. It bugs me because he tries to talk to me about his girlfriends, and even mentions them every so often. It bugs me as well. I like him, but like I would really ever tell him when he has a girlfriend. I got asked out a few days ago, and him being my best friend and the fact he is seeing someone, I told him about it. And he brushed it off like nothing and changed the subject. This wouldn't be a big deal, except that he is the most curious and persistent boy ever. He has to know everything. So the fact he didn't ask details was ridiculously strange. What is the deal??
20090220202621AAnXAuN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What makes some people think they have the right to decide what's good for me, or get in my way?	All in the name of 'your best interests'?      My 20th birthday for example, I didn't want to be a 20 year old virgin, so I asked my friends to help me 'meet women' a few weeks beforehand, while holding the full details. They said sure, well 3 weeks later I still hadn't gotten laid, I decided, whatever. I got an $800 check from family and friends, who told me to have fun. Cashed it out, got my money. I hit the bars for one last attempt the day before my birthday. Well they came out had some fun. They c-blocked me with every woman my friend warned me could be 'easy'. Then to make matters worse, when I told them what I planned to do with the $500 I had left, they took it all! In my attempt to get it back I got arrested for assault. Managed to get out of it by telling them they took my money, 2 of my friends backed me up on it, so the cops let me go and ordered them to give the money back before they got charged with petty-theft. My friends argued about my 'immoral' intentions. The cops seemed cool about it though... Throwing 'This is Canada' back at them and stating 'it's legal here. It's also his body, his money, and his choice' which got me my money back. They even called me a cab and a phone number which he said 'gave a discount to cops'. Well my friends followed the cab and chained me down in the back of one of their trucks. And, well, let's just say I'm still a bitter 20 year old virgin. Thanks to the asinine actions of several people.      So I ask... What makes people think they have the right to decide what's good for me, or the right to get in my way, all in the name of my best interests?

20090220170400AA7IWxP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	A question for the girls who are in relationships!?	I have a really big question for all of the girls here. I will explain the situation, and you tell me what you have gone through as far as things like this in your relationship, and then tell me why people do the things they do.       I am in a relationship with someone that I love with all my heart. He as me to marry him a few weeks ago. The thing is that there are girls that text, email, and send pics and things. He has told them that he is in a relationship, but they continue to do these things. Do you think that it is not appropriate for other females to send pics and things of this nature, including sexual, to a man that is in a relationship? Why is it that there are woman in this world that seem not to be able to get the message when a guy is no longer available and in a serious relationship? What can I do to stop all of this before it ends up killing our relationship?

20090220174248AAb6lQM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do I do about this boy?	A few days ago I was in class and one of my friends called me over to her table and indicated that this guy (we'll call him Jake) wanted to talk to me. We ended up talking and he asked me if I was single and if he could have my number and we talked for the rest of the period. The next day the same thing happened, but the thing is I'M the one who is always called over by the friend to talk to HIM cause he's to shy! I'm not exactly a confident person myself so it's hard for me to do that. I mean if he likes me shouldn't HE be the one to initiate the conversation? So today I didn't do anything and he just stared at me from across the room but didn't say anything...      Does he not like me anymore? Should I try to talk to him b/c he's shy? I dunno what to do or think :P I was maybe gonna IM him tonight but I don't want him to think I'm bothering him or something.

Every since he slipped that out to me I have felt too insecure to kiss him and he rarely kisses me. I LOVE to kiss! I always thought I was good too...anyone else I have ever kissed seemed to really enjoy it. My boyfriend and I have a kid together and will likely marry when we are ready for that, so please don't suggest that I give up on him or something along those lines. We will be together regardless of our kissing styles. I would love some specific and detailed tips on what makes a good kiss and how to give one.

20090220180108AAlI7sJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what do you think? :-)?	This is kinda long. Anyways...last summer...when I was 14, I went to a camp. I'm a nice, decent looking guy...but I've never had a girlfriend. I met a girl there (she was 15)...and we became friends. She was absolutely beautiful...and I never thought I'd stand a chance to go out with her. Well...Date Night comes around...and she actually asks me to be her date for date night. Well of course, I said "Yes"...however, the date didn't go to well, as it was my first one. I didn't really know what to talk about and just kinda like...interviewed her. Lol...stupid me.       Well...it's been half a year now, and I still love this girl...even with all the girls at school...I just love her. She's beautiful and has the most amazing personality...after the camp ended...we texted each other for a period of time...and then just stopped.      well, recently I've started to text her back...just asking how she is and stuff. she's never called/texted me first or anything...      the only thing is...she lives a couple hours away from me...      What's your suggestion/opinion/advice?      thanks!

20090220222650AAaCxs4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why am i still depressed over the dramatic end of my screwed up relationship?	he was my first bf, i was 24 when i met him.  i never met a man i really felt connected to, hence why i didn't have a relationship until much later in life.  i also lost my virginity to him.  after 1 1/2 years, i get a text/call from his other gf/fiance.  he's been leading a double life.  he was with this woman when he met me.        i'm still going through shock and have had 3 panic attacks around strangers in public.  i'm forcing myself to move on.  he never treated me right anyway and i should've left him months before.  my question is...why the hell do i still care?  granted, it's only been 1 month.  but, this level of betrayal is killing me.  to think that people do this.  i'm just glad i got out of it, before who knows what could've happened.      how can you still grieve and miss someone who destroyed your trust in relationships?  why am i still devastated?  why does he get to "win" and keep his other gf (because she's caught him cheating before and continues to stay with him)?

20090220203030AAQ9mE8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Someone please help, what can I do in this messed up situation?	There is this girl who lives down the hall from me who I have known for about five months and really like, but even though we are around each other a lot I always get really quiet and kind of just sit there. She's kind of shy too so even when it's just the two of us sitting there it's just awkward silence. I feel like she must think I either don't like her or are a creep/loser (neither of which are true, I'm just nervous around her). To make things worse, in addition to being a really great person she's also really attractive and gets hit on a lot by weird obsessive guys.      I want to let her know I really like her but don't want to come off as just another creep. I know I have to just start talking to her more, but is there any chance at this point that she could still like me too, or am I permanently that weird antisocial guy??? If I just sat her down and told her that I'm just really shy around her because I like her and ask her out to coffee or something, would that be coming on too strong out of nowhere?
20090220203005AAXFQ3W	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did I spend too much money for this girl?

I really like her but she's a bi and I think she's more into girls.    Anyways I got her mom a box of really good chocolate and I got her a $50 shirt. I also invited her out for dinner to a pretty expensive restaurant. She's blind and she may not care for good looking stuff, but I just wanted to put a nice impression since we haven't met up for more than a year. At the same time I don't waant to look desperate and way too generous because I'm not rich at all.   Oh and we're both adults.

20090220181554AAAJLf8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if your SO told you that they NEVER wanted to have a baby - but you were so in love?	My boyfriend and I have been together for 3 years. In the beginning of our relationship he asked me alot of questions about whether or not I wanted children, I was young at the time and said, "well yes of course." Several months later he told me that he had had a vasectomy after his daughter was born (she is 5 now and he was married before) but that he would consider having one more child. A year later he told me that he didn't think that another baby was something he wanted. (Did he lie to get me where he wanted me or did he really have a change of heart ~ I don't know.) By that time I was head over heels at the time and didn't stress over the issue - I figured he would change his mind or that he might not even be the man I married anyway. Here we are 3 years into a relationship and I am totally in love with this man and couldn't imagine my life without him or with anyone else. He still stands firm on the baby issue and is talking about marriage and buying a house now. I am freaked out! Yes, I love his daughter like she is mine but she obviously isn't. I am happy now but what if I am not years down the road? What if we split (although we are so in love) over this issue and I still can't have a child for some reason? Then I would have obviously made a huge mistake. I recently found out I might have some health issues with pregnancy as well. As you can see, it isn't black or white its a very very grey issue. I feel like I soon have to make a huge decision on an issue because time is running out and we are talking about the next step in our relationship. I sometimes feel like if I made him choose (which is mean and I wouldn't) that he would choose the not having a baby and losing me over having a baby and having me. Think about all the issues here with an open mind and tell me what you would do? I would love to hear if you have been in similar circumstances?

Okay I’ll say the basic’s   My ex…we broke up about 3 or 4 months ago now + we were together for about 4 months.   I just met up with him and some friends today.   But there’s still something there.   The reason we broke up was because at the time I couldn’t have a relationship at the time.   He keeps trying to make me jealous and keeps being really playful with me then after we’ve joked about I saw him go a bit sad…Its like his in two minds about me.   He keeps blushing and is always looking out for me.      I still like him a lot, even if he just touches me it makes me go all warm and funny.   His been my best friend for 4 years, but he has never acted like this before.   What shall I do, does he still like me?

20090220202146AAzeaYj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My Boyfriend's Ex in a Wheelchair?	Okay, I am not lying.. this is a totally true story. My boyfriend used to date a midget. She was about 4' tall and in a wheelchair. They were together for 3 years and he lost his virginity to her. Why am I jealous? Because she was his everything.. the only reason why they broke up was because she cheated on him with another midget in a wheelchair and she's with that guy now. He is into girls who dye their hair funky colors (like she did), and she was gothic-like (which he loves), and she was even in some porn stuff on the internet for people with fetishes (what boyfriend doesn't want to say his girl is so hot people actually pay for pictures of her?). I also feel that she was probably way tighter than I am, because she was so little, and she was so light that they could probably do a ton of freaky stuff together. I'm not fat, but I'm average height and weight.. which is probably heavy to him, after being with her. Am I crazy, or do I have reasons to feel this way? We've been together for a year, and he just Now got rid of some of her things.. after I asked him to. He claims the nude photos of her cant be found, but that means they are probably lurking in his house somewhere for me to find someday.. I've already seen the one's online, but I know there are more. And since we've been together, he hasn't ever wanted to take pics of me like that.. anyway, what do you think?..      ps: I don't want to offend anyone by using the term midget, but i'm not sure what the correct term is, and "little person" sounds really fake..

I started liking him and he knows it. I never contact him he's the one that always contacts me.      A week ago he was teasing me about something and I yelled at him. He asked me why I yelled at him and why I didn't yell at anyone else then I told him that it was because I had feelings for him. He was told me that he wasn't dating (because of a personal problem he told me about and it's understandable). Then last night he tells me that he's going on a date on Saturday with a girl that asked him for his number at the mall and that he as low expectations.      THEN he notices that I wasn't answering his texts and he asks me what I'm doing on Sunday. I told him that I had no plans and he asks me if I was interesting in going hiking with him. I told him "I don't think I can make it"      Should I have gone? Or was it wrong of him to ask me out on a date after he tells me about his date on Saturday?      Should I still see him on Sunday?

Don't get me wrong, he is GORGEOUS. Anyways. At football last year, we were all sitting around, kinda saying who we liked and stuff. And then some of the guys were like Oh we know who Bob* likes, Katie*! And then i see him look at me and then give me a quick smile. So yeah. And now this year for hockey. My friend says she sees him looking at me and stuff. But i don't even know what to think cuz im two years older, and yeah.. There is also always a girl there that is always hanging with the guys and stuff, and i am afraid that she is going to take him away, so that he will never take a second look at me anymore. He is also a shyish guy. And referring back to the football, i wonder if he even did, or possibly still does like me. Ack! Please help me, i like him so much my heart hurts, im wondering what you guys think of my situation. Thank you!
20090220210636AANgMYF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!! What should I do?!?	so at school we had a mile run test, and while my friends and I were running, the boys were playing this game similar to "Truth". While the guys were playing the game, my really good friend eavesdropped on them and told me that one guy admitted that he thought I was hot. The bad thing was that she said this in front of my other friend who liked that guy, and by the time I realized who my friend was talking about, it was too late to stop her. :( and I know that just because a guy thinks your hot doesn't mean they like you. but i don't think my friend is convinced about that... i mean, if I were her, I would be really sad too and I wouldn't listen to what my brain is saying (like those questions like (1) what if he was joking? (2) he doesn't neccessarily mean that he likes the girl.) my friend says she didn't mind, but I know that she would go home and stay sad about it for a long time because thats what I would do. and im just feeling really guilty right now. what should I do when I see her on monday?

20090220193302AADybL2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	HELLLLP!! What is wrong with this guy i sort of like!!?	this girl i know on my team really likes the guy i sort of like. but he doesn't really like her that much. he just wants to get with her (makeout and stuff, not all the way..)   she was previously with a teammate and that lasted a real short time like a month. it was purely physical.       before they first made out i asked the guy to prom. he is really pumped and excited about it.       we def have a better relationship than him and that other girl. we are pretty tight and are good friends, but at the same time we flirt and hug and stuff. we both are in that stage where its okay to be with other people, just as long as we both get to be with each other.       What i don't understand is that why would he be with some girl who really isn't THAT pretty knowing that its going to last for like a month?   WHY do guys do this???

20090220182834AAesGxr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can you cope with the other woman in your boyfriends life?	Despite saying he never would, my boyfriend started a relationship with the woman over the road. The last year has been misery for me. I think that she has done the worst thing a woman can do to another and I think I truly hate her. She has been so much cleverer. She has sung my praises to him and said she doesn't mind at all if he continues to see me as she thinks I'm wonderful and wishes we could be friends. He wants me to be friends with her too. I wish she would drop dead. It has made me so hurt and jealous that I have behaved badly towards him and wanted to hurt him for not dropping her. The situation now is that they are getting on really well, and it's me who's the problem, the baddy, in their eyes. My boyfriend thinks I shouldnt be jealous and bitter, she is happy to accept me, I should be happy to accept her and how he wants to live. He maintains that it is possible for him to love two women, and that he will continue to give is both his all when he is with us. However, he says I mean less to him  at the moment than her, because of my hateful attitude towards her. She apparently has acted with complete grace towards me throughout.      I am in such misery. I love him very much, and hate her for taking him away. However, he says it's my behaviour that is driving him away.      Someone please help me. Am I wrong to want him to myself. He says he doesn't want to be 'owned' by anyone. Is she the clever manipulative ***** I think she is? Im so unhappy, and feel so old and tired and that she has played a better game than me and won. Am I crazy? he has dyslexia, dyspraxia, ahdh, ptsd, borderline personality, narcissistic personality, psychopathic personality disorder and was abused sexually as a child. She too was abused sexually as a child. he says she understands him. Mind you, he says I do too.      Am I just a hateful bitter jealous person in the wrong like he says I am? Is she a clever ***** whi saw what I had and took it? Are they two people who are suited and should I leave them to it? I have never met a man who makes me feel like he does. I can't bear the thought of losing him. Neither apparently, can she.      Help me please. I need all your wisdom in bucketfuls. I am so unhappy. Thankyou.

20090220224938AAuoCCn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do? How can I tell him, I like him without making him feel awkward?	I have a problem, I like a friend of mine that started out as him being my trainer. The thing is that at the beginning I just thought of him as (what he is) a trainer, then we started having these great conversations, we would play around with each other so, we became good friends. We always had lots of fun together but, the thing is we still talk and text each other but we really don't see much of one another anymore.      Now, I have noticed that I have a crush on him, I miss him so much and I want to tell him but I don't know how to, well at least how to start it.  The last time I spoke to him he said " I doing fine, just looking for love", I wanted to tell him that he had found it and that it was me but,   I just froze and changed the subject. Silly me.      I know that its my fear of rejection that doesn't let me tell him or maybe it is something else, but I just don't know.      So my question is "What should I do?" and/or "What should be the best way to tell him?"

20090220165256AAZYFh7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need help with my boyfriend of three years.?	Alright I need some advice, I hope this works.  My boyfriend and I have been together for 4 years. In the past year or so our relationship seems to have been getting harder. He went to another college and his new friends are very influenced by him and vice versa. If he gets too drunk with them he will start a fight with me of mass proportions. for example: last month, he was hung over the toilet sick and my little dog opened the dog and he accused me of opening the door and abandoning him. When he started screaming and getting in my face his friends did nothing and when i started back at him they took his side!  Some times they will instigate things. Also in general, we fight over little things bc i feel vindictive over some of this ****.       Here is where i need the help.        In two weeks he wants to take a couples trip that is 600 miles away.  Catch is the couples are his friends.  I don't know how i feel about this because if something goes wrong like the above example and he has too much to drink, his friends WILL take his side no matter if I am right or wrong. I am scared to have a castrophe like that 600 miles away in another country. I talked to him today about it and he is really upset and feels like I am backing out on him last min.  I really don't want to back out and leave him hanging but I need a game plan to keep us from fighting.  I don't have a prayer if sh*t hits the fan his friends will leave me to dry.  I suggested to him/ asked him if he would not over drink but his reaction was like "who ever means to get that wasted". P.S. Its only for a weekend. All advice is appreciated.  This is my first yahoo question so im excited to see the results.lol

20090220172814AAjg6ZC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is my boyfriend's relationship with his ex legit?	I've always known that my boyfriend of 6 months still keep in touch with his ex-gf (2 years).  But yesterday, I found out that he comments on almost all her blog posts and calls her once every 2 months.  He even drove 2 hours to see her last month when she had a 4 hr layover at the airport.      I confronted him about how uncomfortable and concerned I felt, and he told me he had no intention of getting back in a relationship with her, but that they had a special connection and he would protect her at all costs.  He told me I'm the one he wants to be with, but also admitted that we don't have that close connection yet, (although we lost our virginities together. We're Christian, so it's a big deal.)      Should I be worried?  Do you think he secretly wants her back?  Or am I paranoid?

20090220173952AACK5Wd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long Distance Relationship Trouble?	Last summer i went to a state at the other end of the US (not saying which or where I live for privacy's sake) and I met a girl. We hung out some that summer but it wasn't until months later that we really started texting a lot. Note: we started texting AFTER i had returned to my home state. We kept talking and really started to get interested in each other. We've been talking for a while and somewhere in the run we fell in love. Some of you may be thinking that's dumb and that there's no way we could be in love because of the distance and all, but I truly believe I am 100% in love with her, and I thought she was with me until recently. It seems that the past week or so she has been talking to another guy a lot, and that she even likes him. Am I over reacting or should she not be doing this? She said she texts him all the time. Idk, I just don't like the thought of her telling me she loves me and me telling her I love her and all that but then she's texting  another guy she likes at the same time. What are your thoughts?
20090220174010AAfOnZV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, what would be your response if a guy said this to you?	so around Christmas, I told a girl that I've liked her for a while now. she and I grew up together, and she had already guessed that I liked her when we were little, but this is the first time I actually told her in person. when I told her my feelings, she didn't tell me her feelings, so I didn't push for an answer.      now though, I kinda want her to tell me her feelings, no matter what they are. I just want to know so I won't be in limbo anymore. so is waiting until May (5 months) giving her enough time? Will I sound impatient and make her feel like I'm continuously bugging her with my feelings?      and i can't give up on her. she's my first crush, and we're both 17 now. I'd say it's been around a decade-long crush.

Im so sorry this is so long, but you need to know the details!      okk so .. we've met like half a year ago, he's REALLY nice to me, but hes just nice in general, and i KNOW he has alot of friends that are girls so ya, hes pretty damn good at talking to girls -.-.       But he'd always encourage me, like he'd always compliment me but just stuff like, 'you're good at everything, dont worry' but hed never say anything like flirty. :S Hes told me he hasnt had a girlfriend since like grade 7 .. HOLY CRAP RIGHT? And when I tried flirting with him, like, i'd be joking around, and he'd play along, like id be like 'aw, i thought you were asking me out, nvm. JOKING !' and hed be like 'i was, but you said nvm, LOL JOKES.' and id be like 'you're so cute, kidding, dont freak out.' and hed be like ' :l na im not freaking out i get that alot. JOKES, kidding, dont freak out!'      I ALWAYS talk to him first like .. in the halls and stuff, ugh and he'd walk me to class sometimes but only when i ask him to. And Id tell him to come to my volleyball games and he would and then hed cheer me on and hed be like no I came for you if I contradicted him.      Im tired of this -.- im confused and I feel like im throwing myself at him. What do you think? What should I do? Be honest. Thanks SO much. xoxoxo
20090220174344AA5zk4p	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?, I like him.?	There is this guy. I have known him for over 3 years now. When I first met him I flirted because I liked him. After a few months he asked me out several times. I guess I gave up on him and started dating someone else. While I was dating the other person he found out I liked him so he asked me out, a lot.  When the other guy and I broke up he was there for me. Eventually he asked me out again and I said yes.Then a couple of weeks later I broke up with him.      The year after that he asked me out and I said yes. 1 day later he told his friend to break up with me for him. I cried.     This year I like him again and l was stupid enough to let him know. He stopped talking to me. So l decided to tell him I stopped liking him.He talked to me for a couple of days, he even had the nerve to call my house and ask for help on myspace. Every time l  try to talk to him he checks and reads his messages but doesn't reply.      What should l do? Get over him? Try?

One day she was talking in a very sweet voice and she was talking about the stuffed animals she has on her bed and the names she gives them.  She then mentioned about the colors and designs on her blankets and also about her long pink pillow she has on her bed.  I thought it was sweet and enjoyed talking to her about these things.        Are these just cute things girls talk about or do most girls not talk to guys about this.  She is 19 years old.

20090220175417AAYmCdd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I fell in love with my best friend, what do i do?	My best friend Jacob and I are really close. We hold hands, we kiss goodbye, we tell each other everything. We're always together.  When he and his girlfriend broke up, he was really upset. Though he was the one to end it. The Friday after it happened, we were hanging around town with his friend Danny. It was  just the three of us, and it was the first time I've met Dan. So there was some flirting, naturally. But Jake seemed to be jealous. So Jake grabbed my hand, I guess letting Dan know I was off limits. I didn't see anything wrong with the picture, he always held my hand when ever the opportunity was presented. It got late so we all went back to his house. We were up stairs in his room listening to some music. They were talking about bike parts and I was laying on his bed looking at a magazine. Danny was sitting on the futon playing a video game so, Jake came over and laid next to me. I finished reading the article and tossed it on the floor beside the bed. Jake turned on his side facing me, I did the same. He reached over and pulled me closer to him, this to me was weird, we've never been quite this physical before, and leaned in and kissed me right one the lips. This kiss was not one of our good bye pecks, it was long, wet, and if I recall there was tongue. It got to be to late so, Jake walked me home [he lives down the street from me]. On my front porch he gave me another strange new kiss. That night I was beginning to think it was just a reaction to Dan, but then almost every night after that he seemed to get braver and braver when we were alone.    Two weeks ago [a school night] he called me at 12 30 asking me to sneak out and come over, because I’d forgotten my coat that evening. So, I did. He opened the door for me and told me to go up to his room. So, I did. He came in behind me and shut the door. I figured he never wanted me to just come over and get the coat and leave, so I went to sit on his bed. He sat down next to me. Me being exposed to this new Jake for a couple months I’d learned to expect something that the old me and him wouldn’t have done. And I was right. Earlier that day we had experienced dry sex for the first time. And now I was expecting the real deal, but it was more or less the same thing.   On Monday he didn’t sit with me on the bus. Weird. He didn’t talk to me at school. Defiantly weird. This went on for an entire week. Then on Sunday I heard from Danny that he and his ex were going back out. I’m crushed. I think part of me fell in love him.    I don’t know what to do. I lost my best friend. Do I talk to him? If I do will it make things worse? Could we ever be friends again? I think letting this go to far ruined our relationship. Please, help me.  I need advice!

Issues with my ex weren't resolved before I met his girlfriend, but by meeting her I feel like I finally have closure.

20090220175917AA81h8Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why will he glance at me but not talk to me?	I guess you could say this guy and I had some history. He liked me a few years ago. Sometimes when we see each other, he raises his eyebrows, and looks like he wants to talk to me. Or I feel his eyes on me. He's very confident though. Once I walked up to him and we talked and his hands were constantly in his pockets, he seemed to smile the whole time.      But why will he look at me like he wants to, glances at me in crowds, etc? But never makes the move? He seems pretty confident with other girls?

I am actually starting to have real feelings for a guy which is sorta big for me I suppose, I've never really met any guy that I have fallen for I dont know why but they all have been jerks. He is a very--shy person. But something tells me he could possibly feel the same way....   He stares at me and when we look eachother in the eye he smiles   He tells a joke and looks at me to see if I laugh   He asks me for hugs   He tries to be around me I guess you could say, by being with his"friends" that always just happen to be by my desk...hmmm haha :P   I dont really talk to him much outside of school but I would love to get to know him, I just am not sure if I should start the conversation there is always that feeling of "He probably doesnt want to talk I mean if he did he would say something" or the ever so popular "If he really likes me he will do something about it" Im just scared that if he DOES like me but he is to scared or something to do anything about it we will just let this slide....and I dont know if I will find someone like him again.      Im no so sure what to do in this situation, I like him alot :)) and dont want to mess things up.      so the main question is HOW TO TELL IF A GUY IS INTERESTED in this case a SHY guy :)             http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm74/...           http://i293.photobucket.com/albums/mm74/...          that would be me.

He sometimes comes close to me and stand beside me as he is answering the difficult questions that the customers ask but he doesn't stare at me but he doesn't look into my eyes. He also touched my arms to ask me if i could handle the situation, though we are near. Someimes, I feel he doesn't care about my existence. What is that?

So then he came in and shot her a super-bad look... it was disgusting...   anyway, she looked at me like she shouldn't have said anything... that scares me... a lot   like a week later, he said that he had to get something out of his room, so he left. I looked at what he had on his computer, and he was chatting with a girl named ''kiesha''... here's what it said (and i quote):   kiesha: hi bebe   Brad: hey   kiesha: wanna come over again   Brad: i g2g... girlfriend alert      (he signed out)      WHAT DO I DO!?!?!?!? he's most definately cheating, and I don't know what to do. I love him to death, and i don't want to leave him... i asked him about it, and he said it was nothing... so i dropped it. I trust him a lot, and I don't know if he would ever cheat... he doesn't seem like a player, so I am completely lost...      WHAT DO I DO!?!?!?      oh yeah... we also usually go out and stuff like... every Friday... but he doesn't go anymore. He says that he's too busy... it's just out of the blue. he never was busy... basketball is over, and football was over for a while... so I don't know what he could possibly be doing EVERY FRIDAY...

I'd appreciate this if you could take some time to read this and answer...      ok so im a guy and im 15 and one of my best friends is a girl. I have liked her for some time now, and she knows this. When i told her that i liked her last year she said sorry but she doesnt like me back. She knows that i still like her now, and sometimes when i talk to her it seems like shes kinda flirting with me. She'll sometimes call me babe and that kinda stuff. I really really like her and i hate to say it but i think i might be in love with her. The only thing is that i dont think she likes me back right now but i'm not sure. Also, she always talks about other guys and obsesses over them which can annoy me sometimes. I really love her,  but dont want to mess up our relationship. Does anyone have any idea what i should do? Thank you so much if you took the time to read and answer this...best answer gets 10 points.
20090220181321AAyDfqH	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How should i handle this?	So about a 6 months ago, my boyfriends younger brother, whom is 20 years old moved in with us. I didn't think it would be a big issue but this kid is the laziest person i have ever met in my life. He thinks he can do whatever he wants, hmm like not clean up after himself even tho we have a dishwasher, and when he will actually do the dishes he stops doing them and says im not ******* cleaning up after everybody, but it is fine with him when i clean the house, and cook him supper and do this and that. It's just a hard situation because me boyfriend thinks im being too hard on him. He's not a baby, he is an adult now. I just do not know how to handle this, i don't know how to get it through to both of them. How do you get my boyfriend to understand what im going through and get his brother to start helping out, because yelling and screaming sure haven't helped, or sitting down and talking to them. I just don't want to be taken advantage of anymore. This situation has definitely damaged our relationship. Please help
20090220181447AAMzhNZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to move in to kiss a girl?	im 17 and my gf is 16. its embarrassing but ive never kissed a girl properly before.ive been going out with her for around 4-5 weeks now. im very shy, but i can speak to her, hugged her, quite comfortable with her. and i walk her home almost everyday. i have still yet to kiss her, cause im so freakin shy i can never do it. so i decided that im going to stop being nervous n just do it, as soon as possible. so when i walk her home, when we're having our last conversation before she goes off, if the mood is right, and she looks like she wants to be kissed, do i just go for it? or should i be very polite and ask her if it would be okay to kiss her, if she wants me to kiss her? or is there any other option?
20090220181851AAAaTyJ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I avoid women who have had casual or anonymous sex?

20090220183642AAXUBoK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Prefer for women around 30?	Well I'm in a rut. I've met a woman who i don't understand. I basically spend everyday with her. We are intimate and kiss and get physical. So its not like we dont spend alot of time together. It's been a long time since I've had a true connection with a woman, but with her my life feels content. Well tells me she's not ready. But yet still wants me around alot and calls me and so on. One time I backed off and she pulled me closer. I dont like to play games. She's has told me the same. That she has the same connection with me. i feel she is a real person. I think she is genuine unlike alot of women I have ever met. And I always put a definate line between friends and interest. So it's hard for me to be quiet about it. I like to show my interest. Im flawed. Alot of people say Im passionate. But I look at it as a sin. I need some real advice on how to deal with this or approach this situation from a woman close to her 30's. How do I act towards her? How do I treat her? Any advice is more than welcome.

There is a girl in my Lit class who is really pretty and I really like her... But I don't know if she likes me or hates me. I can't tell.      Here's a regular day: I sit across the room from her and face another direction but I sometimes look at her for a few seconds. About 40% of the time she looks back at me and our eyes meet. I quickly look away. One day heard her ask the girl sitting in front of her "Is he looking at me?" But other than those few milliseconds our eyes meet, she never looks at me.

I went to this sweetheart dance tonight and up out of the blue pops this guy with two of my good guy friends. Now I've seen his face before and he always stared at me or was usually around where I was. Then tonight he was there and he stared at me the whole night, when I would get up he got up and moved. He never asked me to dance or talked to me cause he was to busy sitting by himself. I have a little crush on him but I don't often see him. He didn't dance at all he just walked around the whole time. I'm shy and I was afraid he would reject me.
20090220191048AAHvcmn	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would u do if u were me?	I'm starting to get this feeling my female teacher has a crush on me?   I talk to her allot after school, and i showed her some work i did and she asked to sit with her and then she did all these physical things that made me feel like she liked me. If she were my age shed the type of person Id go out with. I dont want any sex, and I wouldnt even try to go on a date untill like 2-3 years after high school. Id just stay in contact. She is 20, I am 16. She just started teaching. I mean I talk to her allot and I want to apporach this maturaly, I'm still chasing people my own age first. I know thier are bounderies you are not supposed to cross, but i dont care, if i were even 2 years older this would be acceptable. She has had more life expirenxes than I have, and its not like i crushed on her. She seems to be making moves first. Other people were in the room. People say I look and act older than my age. I do not feel haressed, and would prefer someone my own age rather than a teacher. This is like if i were gay, which im not, and people wouldnt fully accept it. And when it comes to me taking care of myself, well im already patenting my own stuff and working hard on my career and only halfway on the road to graduation. I want all opinons, and I'm taking this seriously while at the same time trying to get people my own age. She also asks me about activities she wants to go and watch me play or perform. I do not consider this abnormal, just uncommen.   We werent alone either. There were plenty of people in the room, and it dint feel awkward for me, just unusual. It was a new and enlightening experienxe. Our conversation wasnt awkawrd either. Part personal and part school relalted      LOTs of opinons please?

And i'm still head over heel's in love with her.      I had a dream about her last night, we was so happy. we was in like a park sort of thing ( which im not familiar with ) and we was just being a happy couple who were in love with each other, like something out of a film or something, cheesy couple in love with each other. it felt so real. i woke up thinking we was still together and happy, then realised, it wasnt, later causing an emotional breakdown which was horrible. i actually wished i never woke up.       What the hell does it mean?    How the hell do i stop them?      I'm genuinly scared of going back to sleep because i dont want it to mess me up again.      Cheers    James C   xxx
20090220192147AAK3P85	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do?  Should I try to warn others?	I have finally found the strength to end a very bad relationship.  My ex was verbally and physically abusive, he was a liar, a cheat, and in addition has a very bad gambling problem.  I was with him for 2 years and each thing just got progressively worse.  He likes to leach onto women and is so nice and sweet at the beginning you would never know what he will turn into until it's too late.        I feel the need to warn others, but don't know what to do.  If I post something on dontdatehimgirl.com or even publish my own site -- can I get in trouble?       I'm not the only girl he has done this to either.  What should I do?

20090220193138AANIJCL	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is my friend-turned-boyfriend acting different?	I have been friends with this guy for 9 months.  He first asked me out last summer (August ?).  I said no, b/c I thought I would be moving out of state and didn't want to commit to anyone.  I also wasn't interested at the time.  We started spending time in November as more than friends (like dating, only without the title) and I really started liking him.  We hung out a lot, he payed for my meals, opened doors, texted  me regularly, and things of that nature.I kept waiting and waiting for him to ask me out again.  I thought for sure all the signs I was showing and words I was saying would work.  Finally, a couple weeks ago I decided to ask him what we were doing and if he asked me out I would say yes.  So he asked me to be his girlfriend.  We have hung out a few times since then, but something seems different.  He doesn't go out of his way to hang out with me and doesn't text me as much.  He is also busy with school this semester, so I don't know if that has a lot to do with it.  Has he just lost interest, or is he weirded out?  He told me he's not afraid of commitment.  I have thought about just telling him maybe he should ask me out when he's more into it.  He stills does the same things such as opening doors, and paying for food.  I don't know if he's just that busy or if I should back off.  I don't really know what to say.  Help please

20090220194949AAcIjV7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I get my friends to treat me better?	I learned that I tend to attract people with these certain personalities. Aside from a few, all of my close friends really love calling me stupid and crap. I don't take offence to it because I know they're kidding, and I know I'm not stupid. When we're in class they're like "Wow, you're really smart". It still bothers me though, it seems like it's only me they do this to, and everybody else they're just nice to. At times it really pisses me off and they always give me rude remarks. But another day they'll be really nice to me. Idk what it is but I hate it and at times I like them and then I don't, how do I get them to stop treating me like this?       Also, whenever I tell them to stop it and they're being really annoying, they're like "We're just kidding, stop being so sensitive. Don't take it personally" I'm like wtf, it's like they form groups and like they're all against me and when I try to be mean to them I'm alone and I don't get it. & It's not even that I'm just some person that tags along that they like to mess with. I'm the one who basically made them all know eachother and now it's like they're going against me.    Anyway, what should I do to make them stop? If I confront them they're just gonna start bitching. -_-

20090220202028AAZihpY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I forgive him... Again?	I was in a relationship with my BF, when sometime during the eight month of being together, I found out that he actually had a 6 year long relationship that was based much on infidelity. They were both non-commited. To cut things short, he was cheating on both of us, and in the end, he decided to leave his gf for me. He told me that he wanted to start afresh and build a new life with me. He told me no more lies, and that he had stopped contacting his ex. But just about a few weeks after, his ex appeared on his doorstep to surprise him being all emotional, and yes, they had sex. Turns out that he hasn't told his ex at that point of time that he left her for me. He said he had to 'finish the job' to give his ex a happy ending. And i found this out only after having caught him in a phone conversation with his ex. After a final confrontation between the three of us, he finally dropped the bomb and told his ex that he's in love with me.      Problem now is, I do not know if I'm able to accept him back. My heart yearns for him but morally I know its not right. He cheated on me twice because of issues with his ex. But deep down, I know he truly loves me. He wants me back so much, he's willing to do anything (asked me to handle his calls, meet me everyday) but I'm so afraid of getting hurt again. What do I do?

Okay there's this girl that my boyfriend sits next to in class, and I have a friend in there class, and I trust her, we've been good friends for a while, and she told me that my bf and her flirt in class all the time.  then like the day after I was laying down with my bf, and his phone goes off that he has a text. So I move and he responds, and he puts it back, but like every 2 minutes, I had to get up so he could text...Well when i asked him what him, and his friend john were talking about hes like im not talking to john, I'm talking to melionie....And I asked him if we could go upstairs to talk, and he flips out saying that there is no reason to go upstairs...So we go upstairs and we talk for a bit, then we go  back down stairs to watch the movie we bought, and he's like wheres my phone, i need to text melionie i just stopped talking to her...so i get him his phone, and they text for a good hour, so I go upstairs and go to bed.  Later that week he told me that her dad told her to ask him to dinner...which i know it sounds bad but I told him he couldnt go...So yesterday we went to the mall with a bunch of friends, and he just ditches me and walks around with his friend, which i had no problem with, but when I met up with him to eat, he was texting her, and because I had to babysit for my parents on saturday, he asked her to hang out, but i told him i only had to babysit for an hour, and i said i could come over if he wanted me to, but he said no, im busy, im hanging out with melionie...      He told me there just friends but shes always talking to him about her bf problems, and the reason theyre hanging out is because her bf broke up with her....I dont know what to do, i told him i dont like that he was going over there...and hes still going...      Do you think he likes her?
20090220202532AAZJ0hP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Not That Interested In Girls?	I'm a normal 15 year old guy in every aspect (I enjoy sports, I oggle at woman, I love to work out, I play video games, etc...) except for some reason I'm just not interested in dating a girl... I see all these "couples" at my school break up after a week and never talk to each other again. It just seems like a complete waist of time and I've never seen it get farther than a month... I know I'm not gay, I'm definitely not the pervert, but I do... enjoy women? Anyways, I don't know why I feel the way I do....

20090220203202AAY1gP2	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Any good girls left? Prepare to read..?	Ok so here is the deal...   Im a straight 18 yr old senior in HS. I was raised in a very conservative Hispanic family.I get really sad and disappointed to see how "many", not all, American girls act. The way they dress, talk, and the things they do. Of course im not perfect, but unlike all my friends, i do not drink or smoke, and as you might have imagined, im not sexual active, I respect girls, because i know my mom was a girl once, and i do not look at them with lust, i do admire their bodies, but i do not think bad of them. See reason being, im 6'4" so i like tall girls. :p .. However, don't think i'm all into religion and  think everything is a sin, i just do not know why girls act they way they do.. One example, my "girl" friends make out with other girls for the fun of it, they drink and smoke, some are sexually active, yet some just "mess" around, even the girl who was good[est] ha.. has "messed around with her bf. My plan is to marry a good person, one who gives herself to me because she truly loves me, and not just for pleasure. I get heart broken and discouraged when i see my friends do what they do.. don't they see that one day they are going to have a husband and children.. i kind of see it as disrespect towards them.. but thats just me.. Any ways.. what should i do? Are they're any good girls left? Should i just become like the rest? Become a perverted jerk? Obviously that is what many girls want.. :/ Please and thank you for the Help..

20090220203810AAR4klO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can one tell if they're pretty?	My sister is a very beautiful girl but doesn't think it. She'll refuse to think it. She's much prettier than me. She's only 13 and I see grown men staring at her and guys being very nice to her but she says nothing like that has ever happened to her. She says the only times where a male has called her attractive was when her two best guy friends told her she was very pretty and then another male acquaintance said she was. How can I prove to her that she is actually an extraordinarily pretty girl? How does she not see it!!!? She is also very funny and witty, nice and humbly confident but looks is the only thing she strongly doubts she is blessed with. She tells me people can't all have the "whole package".   Please give me some suggestions.

20090220210021AAZSTA6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys: would you date a girl with no close friends?	I'm laid-back, like to joke around a lot, friendly, get told I'm attractive, and can hold a conversation no problem one on one, but in groups I'm REALLY quiet...I'm working on that though. I had one close friend but she turned on me. I spent most of the last 2 years with my ex and his friends but I don't talk to any of them anymore. I have a few guy friends I've known for years but we don't hang out much. I do have a decent amount of acquaintances though. I feel like if I meet a new guy and we go downtown where lots of people meet up it might be awkward if I don't have a friend to bring with, especially if he has a lot of his with him.      If you liked a girl but she didn't have any close friends would it make you like her less? Or maybe not even want to talk to her at all?

20090220210225AAjPAnF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What Are His Intentions - Why Did He Do This?	Ok, my boyfriend and I broke up about a week ago, because I did something I shouldn't have. But then we got back together because he said "he missed me". We decided to start fresh, have a new start. Keep in mind, my boyfriend is extremley busy with work, so he gets stressed out often, and this affects our relationship greatly, because he's always too busy to spend time with me/and when we do spend time, he doesn't tell me how much I mean to him, because he has lots of other things on his mind.      So then as soon as we decided on that, he told me he wanted to film us doing things...sexually, obviously (he brought this up before, but he wasn't as serious as he is now about it) and told me he really wants to finally be able to have sex with me, and talked a lot more about sex then we ever did.       So today, for my birthday, my friend, my boyfriend and I were supposed to spend the day together in the city. Two days ago, my boyfriend was telling me how he couldn't wait to see me and how much he loved me. Bottom line, is yesterday while I was sleeping over my friends house, he didn't sound excited/interested at all in seeing me.       He called me this morning, and told me he was working all night yesterday so he didn't get any sleep, so I was obviously upset but told him to stay home. He didn't even apologize, or tell me he loved me, he just hung up and ignored my calls.      He wants to see me tomorrow though...alone. Do you think he's in it for just the sex, or do you think he was just really stressed with work so he really didn't have the time to see me?
20090220210537AADqbEg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Can anyone HELP? (relationship problems-kinda long)?	my ex boyfriend and i are really having problems talking to each other. he told my best friend that he still has feelings for me, but he didn't want a relationship. now and then he'll message me on myspace and say stuff like "hey there" or "hey you" but in person it's like i'm invisible and he becomes mute. it seems very weird when we talk. i think i can't talk him like i want to because i still haven't forgiven him (long story).  but today when he messaged me, i told him that talking to him felt weird and he agreed and that was it. Does anyone have any suggestions on how we could rebuild our relationship because neither of us want to stop talking, but when he do talk it isn't right.

20090220211453AA85Gxw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've been played by a guy 3 times but we are talking again. He's acting different but i just dont know...?	He played me by talking to this other girl and crap like that. He used to hide the fact that we were talking, but now he tells people. I catch him staring at me all the time. We hold hands, give big sweet hugs, and kiss. We are always texting, I almost never initiate it, he texts me. We hang out at school and he always asks me to come to games and stuff. He has to have his parents permission to date a girl and they said yes. He still hasn't asked though. We have been talking on and off for about 5 months, like i said he has played me though. This time it has been three weeks but im wondering what i should do. I know it has only been three weeks, but for me it feels like I've been waiting all these 5 months. I don't know if i should end it or wait a little bit longer. He is treating me like I matter this time, but i think he could just be getting better at playing me. He has told me he loves me and that really hurts me because I honestly think I am in love with him and Im pretty sure he doesn't mean it. Please give me some advice, I would really appreciate it! :)

Last weekend, i asked this girl out on the phone to the movies but she said she was busy and when i asked If she was doing anything this weekend, she said she didn't know because she rides horses and has practice on the weekends.

20090220222658AAqkg7b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Did he ever actually like me?	When we where together all we ever planned was having sex. We had a little fight and he starts telling everyone that we broke up. Couple weeks after I was a bit drunk at a party he happened to be at and we ended up having sex. For the next month or so he kept on contacting me and just talking about sex. We stopped talking for a while and now it seems to me that he hasn't been able to get over me. The other day i heard him telling one of his friends that he wants to find a girl to love and settle down. And we started to talk again I'm starting to get a feeling that there is chemistry, but then again sometimes he could be a real jerk just to get my attention. What should I do?
20090220222722AAYJ1u5	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	My bestfriend wants to leave his girlfriend to be with me but..?	We've been through this once before, and now I feel we are going through it again. He's been dating his girlfriend for approximetly nine months. This guy is my bestfriend, and no matter what i would do anything for him. Well, we sort of fell in love a few months ago. But the problem is he loves and doesn't want to hurt his girlfriend, but says he wants to be with me and can't get over it.      I really don't want to give up, I just love him too much, and I see him all the time because he's my bestfriend. Yesterday we had a long conversation about his relationship with her, and it seems he has serious doubts, and when i used to be friends with his girlfriend (we ... don't like eachother anymore, long story) she would tell me a lot of things that sounded like a lot of doubt. He also feels that when she turns 18 (less then a year) the only reason she want's to move in with him is to get away from her parents. From the point of view of me and my friends, and others i've talked to, the only reason they are still together is because he doesn't want to hurt her and because she doesn't think she will fall in love again, and is scared of losing him.      I know I could love him unconditionally. But I don't know what to do. How do I deal with this? i want him so bad, and i dont think i could date another guy, its out of the question.      Oh, also she's been talking about another guy. She told him that hes "sweet, funny, and nice" and my bestfriend thinks she likes him. Its possible. She would talk about him non-stop until he said something about it.

20090220223740AAQvgc4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	I cheated on my husband...?	I cheated on my husband with 5 different men 6 times before we were married... (1 man was twice) and I decided to tell him after we decided to get married because we decided to be open about everything... He says he forgives me, but every time we fight he brings it up over and over again... I am unsure of what to do now... I want him to trust me again and I will do anything... But every little thing he is like who, what, where, when and why. I need some advice on how I can get time to begin trusting me again. The cheating was very early in our relationship... Before the "I Love You's" and moving in and engagement... So what would you do if you ever found yourself here... Please only answer if you are serious... Thank you!

20090220224408AAMYCfM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm not sexy?Don't turn him on??Men help?	I recently gave my boyfriend my virginity,and it wasn't his first time,he has lots of experience.So like right after we had sex,he told me i was bad in bed and i was the worst he's had and he told me like about his ex girlfriends and how they were really good in bed,so i apologized for ruining it for him and told him i would try harder to be better.I didn't just lay there,but it hurt so much cause he wasn't really gentle cause he said he didn't like slow sex,i tried other positions but it hurt way too much.And when we have sex,he can't umm,stay up,and like he'll soften during sex,i thought maybe it had to do with stress or something so i asked him and he said no and told me that it's weird cause it never happened with his ex's and he said that it was because of me and because i'm not as sexy and i don't know how to turn him on,and i don't know how to keep him turned on.So my question is,how can i turn him on so it doesn't happen again

20090220225138AAlvb7V	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	So there's this girl...?	Hi, I'm a junior in high school. Lemme set this up a bit. First off, I have terrible luck with women, and I'm very easily smitten and also quite often heartbroken once I realize that the girl of my affection (once again) doesn't feel the same way about me. So, a bit depressed about this, I asked one of my outside of school friends to set me up with one of her own friends (partially in sarcasm, as a joke). She however, actually sets me up with someone. So I started talking to the girl via AIM, and things seemed to be going very well when talking to her. She asked if we wanted to meet up the next day, and I was totally ecstatic to meet her (I had never met her until then). She asked if she could bring a friend, which was perfectly fine by me (who goes to meet some random guy alone?).      When I met up with her the next day I introduce myself, say hello to her friend and things seem to be going well. Soon enough however I start feeling very uncomfortable around the two, as they're very good friends and I feel like the third wheel. I'm not usually the quiet type, but I didn't really talk that much and I felt like I made a bad impression. I texted the girl once I got home to apologize for how quiet I had been, hoping I didn't make that bad of an impression. She responded back, thanking me for apologizing which left me somewhat puzzled as I wasn't sure I actually had to apologize to begin with.       Over the next couple of days talking with her online became very difficult, and getting her to respond to me was almost impossible. I tried to bring up the outing and how I had felt about it, but she seemed fairly certain that I shouldn't have felt uncomfortable so I just dropped the subject altogether.       After a few days of sparse communication, things started to warm back up again. However, in an upset ranting she then revealed to me how she was crushing on this boy who probably didn't like her back. Needless to say, I felt terrible and didn't really know why my friend had set us up in the first place if this girl had already had her eyes set on someone. How can she even start to like me if she already sees what she thinks she wants?      After talking with the friend who set us up apparently the boy that this girl has a "hopeless crush" on was rumored to be abusive to his previous girlfriend, and this girl is trying to get over liking him (for obvious reasons).       I'm at a loss here. Clearly this girl still likes this guy, no matter what he may have done and I don't want to get in the way of that (that's the kind of person I am, unfortunately), but at the same time I really REALLY like her. Not that I'll follow any of your advice, but what do you think of this whole situation? What would you say be the best course of action?

For horses and dogs, inbreeding is said to enhance qualities of the original animal. ‘Purebreds’ are expensive and, nonetheless, sought for. Why is it that for humans, seems the effects are quite the opposite?      N.B.: I am seeking valid elucidative answers. If you have nothing interesting to say, just skip the question and look for the ones similar to ‘My BF doesn't [whatever uninteresting story], how do I [whatever uninteresting question]?’.
20090220225622AAdoTD5	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Love doctors, i need help with my situation!?! His family is against our relationship. what shall i do?	I’m seeing this guy for a couple of months now. I never intended to get serious at him coz of my studies but now I have fallen completely in love with him coz he didn't give me any reason not to. At first I was doubting his feelings but as time goes by I really felt that he’s  truly in love with  me. He’s foreigner ,7 years older than  me and he already have a stable work.  While me I’m still a university student who have big obligation to her family.   He ask me to marry him after i finish my studies  but I explained to him that  I need four years since i have to work hard after I graduate to help my family. Since he loves me he said he’s willing to wait.    Lately he suddenly stopped seeing me.    When he showed up, he explained he was having family matters.    He told his family (who are in abroad) about our relationship. He’s mom strongly refuse to accept us because they already want him to marry someone---his cousin. (Yes, endogamy. which is part of their family culture) He strongly argued with his parents.    He told me that he'd fight his parents just for me.  Several days past he’s problem became even worst. Now their whole clan his against our relationship. They don’t want him to marry someone from another country. And they all insist on him marrying his cousin.    I feel terribly bad for him since his torn between two stones hitting on each other. Now,he told me that he can’t live peacefully without  his family blessing and he can’t also live happily without me.    I don’t know what to do ='(    he loves me but his entire family is against us.   I love him but right now I can’t commit myself completely to him since I still have school and my family to support.    I was thinking of ending our relationship.    I know someone has to let go..im sure his family wont..so I think it will have to be me.    I don’t want to be the reason for him to cut ties with his family. I fully understand how much he loves his family.   I love him but I have to let go.(i don't want him to face more difficulties)    If you understand what am saying right now..i want to know..   am i doing the right thing? is this   the right thing to do? I need an advice.thanks for taking me seriously.
20090220225658AAAmnNt	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What to do about this girl?	I've had a friend lets call her "G". Me and G have been Friends since freshmen year in high school. I've always had a crush on her and she's always known it, lol. Ive asked her out a few times and she's always just laughed it off but we've always still been friends. Fast forward to senior year. We were texting and now she is saying how she wants to go to the prom with me and stuff.  My problem is she has given me the run-around for basically three years and now seemingly out of the blue she acts somewhat interested in me.  I do like her but I don't want to get into something and just have her hurt me. There's this other girl who i know that if we do go out there is very little chance of that happening.   I guess im just a little suspicious of G's motives, I want her as a friend but afyter 3 years of trying i guess im a little tired of her games.      Anyone out there have any wisdom?         Thanks

20090220225925AArLDQ6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I've been seeing a wonderful man for the past few months. He recently (8 months ago) broke his engagement. I?	am a single mom. We see each other when we can, every few weeks or so. We both are very busy. I am very confused by his signals. When we are together he tells me how much he enjoys my company and we are extremely attracted to each other. I don't feel that he only wants me for sex, because it doesn't happen every time we see each other. We mainly communicate via texts because we are both so busy.My confusion is that he is very sporadic about answering texts. Sometimes it takes several hours to a day for him to answer. That drives me crazy, since I am so prompt whenever I receive texts from anyone. I don't get it. Every time I think "he's just not that into you" he   shows me that is not the case, but he's very inconsistent.....?

20090221005632AAGif6Z	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	He likes me a lot, and now another girl is liking him, and he might like her back, what can i do to stand out?	for many months (and still-->) this guy would stare at me and look at me like a hawk. All my friends said he must have been crazy over my looks cause he only did it to me. Sure he's probably Look at other girls but they said he stuck to me pretty much like glue, and we started talking and he does like me...a lot.       But now this other girl comes around who he has already said it good looking and hot. But she does act bad when drunk and kisses a lot of her male friends on the lips. I think he still looks at me more even when she is around. But what else can I do to stand out? Is there anything... or does he like who he likes and how can I tell he likes me more?
20090221010028AA9IUBO	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	If the guy I like (who does like me) starts liking another girl who likes him, should I step back?	and give him and her space to know if he likes her more than me?

20090220234009AAMGwQ6	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Should I tell him I want to be more than friends?	I am 36 and very good friends with a man I have known since I was 16. He is very important to me, and we have been dancing around making our relationship more than friends for 3 years. I have always been afraid to tell him how I feel about him. He told me several months ago that he wishes we had made our lives together instead of making all the mistakes that we had (failed marriages). I didn't know what to say, so I told him if that was meant to be it would have worked out a long time ago. He looked crushed, and it hasn't been mentioned since. We still talk about everything important to us (family, work, futures, happiness) and hang out several times a week, and I love his kids as if they were my own. We haven't so much as kissed since we were 19. But when he hugs me, it is a tight and tender embrace. The way he looks into my eyes absolutely melts me.    Now he has started casually seeing another girl, and I am happy for him...but must admit I am feeling a little sad. I don't want to come in between him and a possible new romance, but I honestly think I am in love with him. I know that he has wanted to make our relationship more for some time, just the timing was all wrong with my pending divorce (he has been divorced now for 2 years). Should I tell him how I feel? I can't bear to lose our friendship, but I feel so much more than that for him and I don't want to miss out on that either. Thanks so much for any advice you have.
20090221003403AAJXhfb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I feel comfortable having sex again?	I am 20 years old and have been with my boyfriend for the past year and a half.       Before I met him I had a very unhealthy sex life. I used drugs and was locked in a turbulent 3 year relationship. I cheated on my ex with his best friend at the time for the last 4 months of the relationship. He would emotionally abuse me as well as physically abuse me when we would get really drunk and high (which was every single day we spent together).       When I was 15, right before I got together with my ex, a close friend raped me. Up until recently, I always thought it was my fault and never really dealt with it.       I met my current boyfriend through my ex's best friend (they are both musicians) and have since left that life-style and all of the people in it behind. I have not drank alcohol or touch any substances for 1 year and six months and am happy to say that I will never again need to use in my life.      I feel like I found my soul mate concerning my current boyfriend. I do not feel tied down by him at all, he makes me feel like I can accomplish anything I set my mind to, and he supports me like no other.       For the first year or so, our sex life was better than it has ever been in my entire life. I had never connected with someone so deeply on an emotional level.      For the last 5 or 6 months, I have been having real problems having sex. Every time he comes onto me, I start to panic, and at first he thought he was doing something wrong. It made him feel rejected.      He now realizes that there's a problem going on. We do have sex, about 2-4 times a week, however before we do I go through this ritual of rejecting him and saying I don't want to do anything. Every time he says he wants to touch me, or says something sexual to me, I can't help but get nervous and say something to the effect of "ew, no." It is so predictable to the point where I don't have to say anything after he does somethingl, he'll literally reject himself saying "i know...you don't want to."      It isn't putting a wedge between our relationship just yet because we are a strong couple and plan to marry each other, but it is so frustrating for the both of us.       Unfortunately, I don't have the insurance coverage nor the extra cash to see a therapist about this just yet...      Does any one have any suggestions on how I can over come this fear of intimacy or something to help us overcome this together?      Thank you in advance
20090221001158AALX0Mk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why is she acting like this? 10 PTS for BEST ANSWER?	It all started when I had feelings for this girl (and I think she had feelings for me).      In class, we were watching a movie and I was sitting by myself, and she was as well. I looked back with a smirk on my face, and told her to come here using my hands/fingers. She came up to be with a kool-aid smile (lol) and rushed to sit by me. We talked, and talked...We talked about her weekends, and etc. I said a few jokes and we both laughed.      Week 2:      We're watching a new movie in class, and I notice she was laying down (on her side with her hand on her head) on the stage by herself while watching the movie. I approach her and sat behind her (on the stairs). I said hey, she gave me a wave with a smile on her face. We didn't talk much because I noticed her squinting her eyes to the T.V, so I figured she was too focus on the movie. I offered her some candy, and said thanks (with a smile of course). I said some jokes about the movies once again, and we both laughed. And that's how that day went.      Now, the days after she feels like she's too cool to even notice me now. She walks by me, without even saying hey, and etc. I don't even know what's going on...Any ideas?           I'm 19 and she's probably 17.
20090221000205AAf9pFg	Family & Relationships;Family	Im the whore of the family?	Well, no im not, but they don't trust me with my boyfriend, they think we have sex and all (im 17) but we don't. Its a good relationship and we know our priorities and we don't cross the line BUT   they think im a bad influence for my cousin who is barely 15   so her dad doenst want her much around me even if she lives next door       WHAT THEY DONT KNOW    is that i protect my cousin more than myself cus shes like my sister and her boyfriend is her fisrt boyfriend and well he broke up with her because she wouldnt let him touch her and stuff and when he couldnt get anyone else he came back to her and now i think shes letting him "touch her".       I just found out but i wanna HURT him cus he said something about me and my bf umm...making out so she would let him.   Like hes pushing her, trying to convince her.         how can i make him suffer!? of course in a subtle slow way      my cousin is very inocent 4 her age... seriously
20090221003531AAo3UBs	Family & Relationships;Family	How would you take this?	ok, well back when i was 9 i really wanted to join a hockey league. so i talked to it to my granddad and my dad. i excluded my grandmom from the conversation because i know she thinks hockey is a rough sport. well i started playing hockey in her street with other kids when i was 5-ish. She began to figure out that i loved the game and after 4 years of street skating i was ready for the upcoming league. but i tried to keep her out of it but she just had to stick her nose in it, later she found out the buzz about me playing. so a few days later she calls my dad out of concern and says,"you're not really going to let him play hockey, are you"? so i played anyways when i was 10. it just so happens that i figured out that hockey is my calling in life! well now im going to be turning 13 in a few days and my dad just told me how she said that today 2/20/09, im turning 13 on the 23rd. and when i found out she said that i went into a huge rage, so i called her up and i asked her, "Why would you say such an outrageous comment,  i mean you really tried to hold me back from something i wanted to do, why would you do that"! and she said, "i didnt want you to get hurt". then i said back, "well you would heave held me back from my life and something i love"! and i hung up cause i was so mad! i felt insulted, and if i would have listened to her i would have never found my true passion and love. wouldn't you be insulted to? i mean really, now it's my favourite sport and i hope to go pro one day! her only dumb little response was that she didn't want me to get hurt! dumb excuse, wouldn't you be insulted? please comment if you would or wouldn't be and tell my why
20090220230918AAywPz0	Family & Relationships;Family	What do I do to make me closer to my mom?	Ok, well my mom treats me like shet, she calls me retarded,stupid that ill never be something in this world. It hurts because everytime I try to get close to her she pushes me away(not in a physical way) and it breaks my heart that my own mother doesn't believe in me.       I just had a son. And I think that's what made her mad and it hurts because she dint even show up 4 my baby shower. And what's worse is her new boyfriend is also to blame he's putting ideas in her hear and I know he's only with my mom 4 the money. Because he quit his job he got kicked out of his house on porpuse to move to my moms house. And he thinks he own my moms house.       But do any of ya'll have any advice on how I can be closer to my mom.

We are not in a relationship but we almost act like it (I stay at his house often...he cooks for me...we spend days on end together...we volunteer together...he includes me in his future plans...with an incredible low amount of sexual activity)   I he's not using me for sex...it was never important to either of us. We haven't had sex in a month, but our bond is getting stronger and the time we spend together is more and more. He owes me a little money (which I dont really want back but his pride wont let him let it go) I feel like he is the incredible person he is to me because of his pride and not because he wants to be incredible to me...which is bad...I dont want him to be like "alright I paid you back, see ya"      The amount of time he invests with me in chillin and productivity makes me feel like he's my friend for real (and thats all I'm asking for...I care, but I'm just trying to take things slow...even If he fell in love with somone else I'd be alright)...circumstances make me wonder though.    How do I tell the difference???

I really only want to invite the people I actually talk to, but as an example.        I would be inviting my aunt, her husband, and one of my cousins.  Which means my two other cousins wouldn't be invited.   (They are all moved out of the house, so thats not an issue)      But I feel like because I'm inviting some of them, its rude not to invite all of them.  Even though I haven't spoken to the other two in a few years.        I'm having the same problem with my aunt and uncle on my dads side.  My mom (who's been divorced from my dad for 15+ years invited them to her wedding last Nov and they came), so I feel like if I didn't invite them to mine they'd be offended.  But my moms wedding was the first time talking to them since my dad passed away in 2001, when they refused to come to his funeral because they didn't like him.        Wedding are way to complicated haha       Advice please?

20090221005921AAjrcHh	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why did she have bruises all over her neck?	A friend of mine came over my house the other night for dinner.  She was wearing a hoodie, but I caught a bunch of glimpses of her neck and there were bruises all over it.  I mean huge black and purple marks all over.  It was absolutely disturbing and I wont lie, a bit gross. She was obviously trying to hide it.  I have no clue what it was, I really had to resist the urge to ask but now I am a bit worried.  She has a fiance, he isnt the nicest guy but he definitely is not a beater.  What could cause this?

20090221002938AASEN4U	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why do girls get so jealous?	I went out on one date with this girl I really liked. She liked me too, but for some reason (perhaps I was too nice to her), she said she didn't want to date and just wanted to be friends. So I'm at a house party tonight and I meet this gorgeous sophomore and we are grindin like none other and making out and dancing at least for 20 mins straight. I began to notice the girl I dated was hovering around me every few mins and when I looked over at her she gave me this death stare. She looks greatly pissed. So later that night I told her to stop being angry all the time and she said "I'm not angry it's just my nature" but I got a vibe from her that she was upset. Plus she's one of those people who hide their feelings to not make a scene.

I went out with my current boyfriend for 4 months and then we broke up. Within those 4 months he told he loved me. our relationship was more of a strong attraction then verbal, but no sex. we were broken up for a year. i am 16, he is 17. he asked me back out a few of days ago because he still likes me. He is the hardest person to read.. even his friends tell me that he is so complicated to know exactly what he is thinking. He doesnt talk to me much but we both adore eachother. maybe its because ive been his only girlfriend and he doesn't know how to act.    What do you think he is doing asking me out a year after we broke up(we haven't talked, only have some classes together).    GUYS, what do you think he is feeling?

20090221003100AAhwOlS	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	When Love and Hate Collide....?	Like is it possible to love someone and hate them at the same time?  I mean I love my sons father.  But he hurt me really bad, he moved in with another woman while I was pregnant, he played so many mind games with me.   He has been tellin me he loves me and wants me back but it will be a while before he moves out of his girlfriends house.  So I asked him last night who is heart really belonged to and he told me he couldnt answer that.  Obviously it doesnt really belong to me, it belongs to her.   Our son is 2 months old now and he took our son for the first time last night cuz I had to work and he was gonna babysit, and soon as we parted ways he bacame a complete d*ck to me and wouldnt even tell me how he was doing when I asked.  Like I am so tired of his games and being hurt, but I love him, and not only becuz he is my sons father, there are other reasons too.  But I told him today that I was done, that he needed to stay with his other family (she has 2 kids that arent his, but none by him).  I'm just so hurt.  What do I do?  I am really almost to that point where I litterally get sick to my stomach when I even think about him or see him.  I have to deal with him for the next 18 years, but I almost want to hate him.  How do I deal with this?

I don't know anybody here, I'm a very outgoing person but I just don't know where to begin. The University's Classes don't start until next week, and orientation and other events don't start until Tuesday. I just feel really left out and I don't want to have a miserable time while I'm here, so how do I begin, where do I go?? I'm not going to just randomly show up at random people's dorm and ask "he do you wanna hang out" cause that's just really creepy. What should I do?

20090220235547AA80dO5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I write my ex a note that says.......?	Hi, I broke up with my boyfriend a few months ago. We have seen each other quite a bit since then but i just found out he is seeing someone i know after he told me he still likes me. I have one of his dvds at home that i have to give back, and i was thinking i should put it in his letterbox with a note on it that says "dear____ you are a totally different person from when i met you. what was once the best boyfriend i could ask for who made me so happy is now someone who cares about nothing but himself, sex and the drugs he is going to take on the weekend. If you don't get off this self destructive path, then your going to lose more than just friends...your life in general will fall apart. The lies you feed to me have just given me the opportunity to never trust you again. You ruined the best thing that ever happened to you, and you have lost me forever.       Is this silly? any suggestions on what  i should write???
20090220235914AA0ePaw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he love me? Or should I keep the question myself?	I always want to ask my boyfriend whether he really loves me. I feel lonely every day. But I couldn't ask him again because last time he seemed upset and asked me whether he did something wrong that made me feel he didn't love me. I don't want to hurt his feeling again. So I just hide my question in my heart.    Why do I always feel I really shouldn't question his heart until I hurt his heart? But then why do I keep questioning after we are good again and why couldn't I be sure of our relationship?    Is there something wrong I don't realize, or are we not supposed to be together? But if I break up with him today with a sense of sadness, tomorrow some time when I think of him, I will have a broken heart and wish to die.    I hope he marries me right now, and then I will have a little more confidence about our love and myself. But it won't happen right now, or maybe forever because I don't know whether he loves me or not.   I am tired of being single and meeting hypocritical people. I want to tell him I want to marry him. I feel terrified about many things every day. If he really loves me, I could rest my heart in a safe harbor.    Why do I feel I could not be happy forever? Should I tell him a little bit about my feeling, or should I keep my concerns for the sake of our current, perhaps brief, relationship?

20090220235603AAkmuLn	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	He called me the wrong name in bed....?	...then never talked to me again?      Long story short. I was casually seeing someone for 6 months. He had feelings for his ex. I had a hunch about this but gave him a chance. After she moved to the city, he backed off. The next time we hung out, he called me her name while in bed. Closed his eyes, was humiliated. I handled it reasonably, asked him to be honest. He confessed his feelings, said I deserve so much better, I'm awesome, he'd never do it again.      he then NEVER talked to me for over a month.....until about 40 minutes ago. I got a text. Said he thought he saw me somewhere, was scared to say hi because i must hate him and think he's horrible. he felt bad, kept his distance. i dont know WHY i texted back but said i dont hate anyone, and dont think hes THAT horrible, he shouldnt be so scared/a huge snob.      yeah, he's a douche. i'd never date him again. but im a forgiving/kind person. except for i was the last to text...and he hasnt responded and now i wish i hadnt said anything. ADVICE?
20090221012054AAh84Wx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why do people freak out when I tell them I hate being a girl?	To put it simply I hate most things about being a girl. I realise I probably wouldn't fit in with being a guy either but I am a girl and I do not like it. I'm like the loser with my friends because I don't pay attention to makeup or hair or shopping which pisses me off, why does that make me any less of a person than them? I'm not even a tomboy because I hate sports too and most tomboys I've seen love sports...I hate having boobs, getting periods and I hate children and am never becoming a mother because I would most deffinately become a child abuser. I just don't understand why people have such a problem with me hating being a girl?
20090221002934AAw4WBu	Family & Relationships;Friends	I have a friend and she is so hard to talk to and difficult.?	She is also impossible to reason with. It is her way or no way. And she always wins. And she sems to think that cause I'm a guy I should let her get what she wants every time. Even her female friends agree that she is like this and she never does anything she isn't interested in, even though i go to her things she's interested in and I completely dislike. I just go to be a good friend, and I like to participate. But when I organise something she says "No, I don't like that," or similar. It is so blunt and its difficult to deal with. Lately I have pretty much just been not talking to her, because I am sick of it. I've known her for about 3 years and she is getting worse. I have discussed with her why she won't go anywhere. I asked why she won't come to anything I organise and she says "It's because I'm not interested" and I asked back "I always go to your things, why don't you go to mine" and she told me "it's cause you're a good friend." and i said back "well, can you please try and be a good friend to me", t hen she didn't  reply. She went off MSN. That was it.      Now, before you write answers, I am 19, I'm not a silly kid. And we are just friends.       How should I resolve this???      Thanks heaps.

I've never been much of a talker with my family before, but when I wanted or needed to say something there was no problem. Now when I try talk to her I'm using this weird low voice and am stumbling over my words and can't seem to find the right thing to say, even when I know what it is I want to say.

She moved away when I was 20 and I have been looking for her since. I guess she is married now, but I found her and I moved close to her. I write her letters everyday but she never writes back.

20090220231109AAxO1TP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you have dated her? (please answer)?	My friend is a lesbian and had her first kiss with this girl she was good friends with and had a crush one. The girl freaked out and never talked to her again, but also never told anyone about the kiss. My friend moved on and dated two different girls in her freshmen year. Then in her sophomore year the girl she kissed in 7th grade transferred to her school. They started talking and the girl said that she liked her and was scared in 7th grade, but wanted to date her now. They've been dating for about 2 years, but my other friend keeps saying that the girl probably isn't gay and is just experimenting. Do you think she would have been in the relationship for 2 yrs if she was just experimenting? Also would you have started dating her in the first place because of how she acted the first time?

20090221005953AAbKGxu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Engaged again 2nd time same guy, but still like someone else?	Okay, so the situation is that I was married to guy#1 for 2 years and then we got divorced. Guy#1 moved another woman in and we just weren't compatible anymore; therefore I started dating. I dated 4 guys and became really infatuated with the last guy I dated and we will call him guy#2. Then along comes guy#1 again and says that he wants to try it again. Well I had moved out of town and was moving on with my life and he was having problems with his new fiance. So he came to visited me and asked me to move back in with him. (This was the third time we had seperated while we were married, but the first time divorced.) So we had a reputation of seperating and getting back together. So I told guy#2 that my ex wanted to try it again, but that I still cared for him and he said that he understood. I moved back in with guy#1 and it is better than it had been b4, but I really miss being single and doing whatever I want. And lately I have been talking to guy#2 and have realized that I really enjoyed being with him. With guy#1 I don't have the conversation that I have with guy#2, but I have the past(which wasn't always good) with guy#1 and I am used to it. But on the other hand with guy#2 I have felt completely comfortable since day 2 and have since. I am engaged to guy#1, but dont know if I am doing it 'cause it is old hat. I really miss guy#2, and everything about him. It was never about sex with guy#2, even though it was great but about the conversation that I couldn't ever have with guy#1. Also the sex was great with guy#1. A part of me wants to tell guy#1 that I don't want to rush into it again and that I still want to date and be single. How do I deal with this I am just so freaking lost and confused?   And if you guys think I should tell him that I want to be single, please tell me how to go about saying so. I am also 22yrs old. Maybe I am just nervous since this is attemp#4. Help!   I guess what I truly want is to date and live on my own and do what I want, when I want, how I want.

I keep seeing posts basically saying that men should understand and be faithful even with little or not sex.  So what is it with you women then complaining that the man will not give it up and that if you cheat because of it, he is to blame?

20090220233504AAzgoZG	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend acting like  this?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarden and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. then when we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward to me.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         We also used to talk on AIM after I moved so we could stay in touch. Well, one day we just stopped talking. Then a few months ago I was being all silly trying to guess all my friends PWs. I actually got hers! I wasn't even on her Buddy List, no wonder we hadn't talked on there in so long! And the thing is, I have no idea when she took me off...         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure?"      I reply, "Yes, I'm 100% sure you did. Don't you remember? You seriously don't remember?"      Then she says, "Not really, I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile on her and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was a little fishy, almost as if she lied.         Why would she be ac

20090220234234AAZZUta	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think i like my ex's best friend..?	ok.. so i had been with this boy for roughly 8 months. then out of nowhere, he told me that it was all a lie, he never loved me, everything with me was a mistake, and he was still in love with his ex in another part or the state. So we are over. But days before we broke up, his best friend mentioned liking me. Then after we broke up, his best friend was there for me, and we flirted. ALOT. we think we want to try getting together. BUT we dont want to ruin his and my ex's friendship.. what do we do?!
20090221001052AAEPr5l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I move on from an Ex-Fiance that left me hanging?	Ok, here is my story. I was with someone I was in love with for almost 5 years. We dated for two and were engaged for one. I am in college and I moved 3 1/2 hours away to finish my degree. I lived with my ex for 9 months and on New Years 12:10am he broke up with me. He said he fell out of love with me and doesn't love me anymore. He tells me that he doesn't want to be with anyone else and has no interest in dating anyone. He lived with me for almost 20 days before moving out and wants to be friends. We talk everyday, he stays over sometimes and sometimes we are more than friends. He still says he doesn't love me, but that he has never loved anyone more than he used to love me. I know that it is in the best that I move on, but I am struggling. How do I move on from him when I feel like I need him in my life and how do I do it when all my family and best friends are not close. I now live alone, which I have never done and I struggle to be happy everyday. What suggestions do you have to help someone like me find the peace in this disaster and hopefully pick up the pieces to start my own life?

20090220230430AA3e4YG	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	There is distance between my boyfriend and i and i am worried about him.  he never wants to hold me, he never?	says anything nice to me, he just wants to sit in his basement all day and abuse xanax and weed.  he is always sleepy and it breaks my heart to see him like this because we are drifting apart a lot and we've been really close friends for 7 years on top of being together for the past 3 years.  i dont want to control him or let the chasm between us grow any deeper. i just want him to be happier.  i feel bad for him because he sits in his basement all day watching tv but he likes it so my pity seems in a way unwarranted. our life together is mysterious and we dont talk enough anymore.  we still have happy loving and passionate moments but they are growing more rare everyday. i feel when i go and look in his eyes they are cold and lifeless and i can see right through him. i feel like giving up is out of the question because i am so deeply in love but i often wonder whether the person i love exists anymore. i miss my baby!
20090221002312AAP8GHA	Family & Relationships;Friends	My mom doesn't approve of the guy I like.?	You see, there's this guy that I like and I've been dating him for the past 3 years. And he's really sweet, caring, funny, and nice and he does everything you can possibly think of for me. But there's one draw back: he smokes. I mean I'm fine with it because he doesn't smoke around me and my mom won't even get to know him because he smokes. When we first met he was smoking 2 packs a day now he's down to like 3 cigarettes a day because I have severe asthma and he knows the smoke bothers me so he's been trying to quit. And I love him for it. But my mom knows he's kind and he loves me but she won't get passed the stupid smoking thing. She knows I'm smart enough not to wind up like her who started smoking because my father did. What should I do? My whole family likes him but she won't get to know him because of this.

My husband and I got married in a civil ceremony and we are planning on getting our marriage blessed in the church as we are both Catholic.      I'm at a loss when it comes to the part of the ceremony where we will be exchanging rings. Neither of us wants to get new rings. So I was wondering how we'd be able to work through that in the ceremony. We were thinking about just getting our rings engraved since we haven't done that yet and getting the rings blessed by the priest. But I'm not sure how this works.      Does anybody have ideas what we can do?      Thanks!

20090220231427AAwQAdW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I should have known she didn't like me ...?	For the past few weeks a girl who's sat next to me has looked at me a lot, sort of longingly almost (as if she wanted me to talk to her) ... I was too busy talking with my other friend and working on homework, so I didn't pay her much attention; that and I was a bit too shy to initiate convo because she's a pretty cute girl and I don't fare well in awkward situations (who does, lol)...      Anyway I was planning on actually trying to get to know her better this week, but she wasn't displaying the normal signs that she's at least curious about me. She didn't stare at all (and we sit next to each other), so I'm a bit flustered. Perhaps she's simply a nervous girl in general and didn't actually think anything of me? I looked at her and said something small but she didn't reply happily or anything. Maybe this thing about her liking me was some hopeful concoction I produced in my head ? I'm so confused, girls drive me nuts !

20090220233409AAb5VAo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does She Like Me? Yes, yet ANOTHER one..?	So there is this girl in my class..She sits beside me. Whenever she talks to me, she is turned towards me, and always looks at me. She touches my arm every now and then, and I am very confused as to whether she likes me or not.      This is because she is a very outgoing person. She is easy to talk to, and very sweet. Because she is an outgoing person, it is tough to say whether she is flirting with me just to be nice...or to get my attention      Although, today in class, my friend sat beside me instead of her. She was trying to sit by me when she saw that my friend was by me, but my "friend" wouldn't move.       Also, she doesnt talk to me as much in the halls. She seems to glance at me and then run away..      Im one of those guys that likes to know if a girl likes him or not before actually asking her out, and I really need help with this.       P.S. She is going to Ontario for the entire summer and might possibly be staying there. Is that something that should affect whether or not I ask her out?       Someone help?

20090220233425AA42xNa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Losing interest during sex?	im a younger guy, early 20s, and there have been a couple times where i have lost interest in the middle of sex and have gone flaccid. it's only happened like twice, but my mind will wander off and i will simply just go limp and i have trouble getting it back up. i've never had that problem at all, but the two times that it's happened has been very embarrasing. i dont know what it is. ill be enjoying myself and then my labito will just plunge and im out of it.    im a bit worried because im going to go visit my girlfriend overseas, whom i havent seen in several months and the last thing i want to happen is that. i dont think it will, but i think if i remain nervous it might. ive never lost an erection during masturbation etc, so i dont think it's a physical problem, and im pretty sure it's 100% mental. i think the last time was because i cheated on my girlfriend, and my feeling of guilt just totally destroyed the mood. (different topic, but i confessed immediately and have felt bad since) the time before that was last summer. my gf who was still here at the time, we had sex and for no reason i just went flaccid. i tried for a long time in vain to get it back up but it took like an hour. i couldnt think sexy thoughts in my head, it was just completely blank. a couple hours later i was able to achieve a rather weak erection and the moment was gone. again, i havent had this problem before and any advice would be amazing.   btw, i really really enjoy having sex like most guys, and am attracted to my girlfriend very much so. this has happened only twice and basically im wondering if this is normal. im just scared i wont be able to perform when the time comes in a couple months. :/ thanks

He was guessing my size and he asked me what size I was and I told him i was size 7.   He was right... but that size was my 3rd (middle) finger.

20090220233711AAbkRA7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is my fiance not ready for this commitment?	My fiance and I have been together for almost three years now and we just moved in together : D. Things were going so great! Until recently. We have this new problem. He plays WoW. I play it too sometimes but he likes to play it all night long until like 5 or 6 in the morning. I am okay with that in moderation, but when I suggested maybe we only do the all night thing every once in awhile he kind of gets upset with me and he says he feels like im taking things away from him. Another example, a friend texted him at 4 AM. and he said he didn't think I would let him go out with him and I said, "no that to me seems a little weird to leave at four in the morning." Then again, he brings up me taking things away from him and how I supposedly hate his friends. I try talking to him like an adult but normally he just rolls over in bed, sighs, and says "i dont want to talk about it anymore." Do you think my fiance is ready to get married...seems to me like he might need to grow up a little! I don't want to take these freedoms away...why is he not willing to compromise? This is like five questions in one...I just need some thoughts! Thanks!

Ok theres this girl who sits next to me in maths who sinks of body odar sometimes (especially if we have maths last period). I do know this girl as I occisionaly sit with her "group". We have set seating in maths so it is not possible to change me seat. I can't do the eyesight thing either because I already sit at the front of the class. I'm scared that when people come near her they will think its me who smells. Not to mention its hard for me to work when shes stinking up next to me. What should I do?? I don't want to hurt her feelings as shes a really nice girl. I also want to avoid going behind her back and getting someone else to tell her because I don't want people to gang up on her.

20090220235506AAGyMZ0	Family & Relationships	How can i win him over?	Two years ago after a huge row I cheated on my boyfriend of three years. He found out confronted me and I admitted it.    Ever since then I've had a really big insecurity that he's going to do the same thing to me.    He met a woman twice last year behind my back but he didn't sleep with her, he said he met her to escape my nagging and accusations. But he realised what he was doing was wrong and cut her off completely.    Last week was valentines and had a bad football game and cancelled our plans. I was so upset and thought he was with someone else.    We've broken up over this now and I don't know what to do. I love him and we when spoke last night he says he's still in love with me.    I've tried to explain that if he was a little more attentive to my needs I.e. days which are important to me, sticking to our plans etc. I would feel more secure.
20090220235325AABKHiA	Family & Relationships;Friends	I need some advise, please help!?	ok well here is the thing. i met this one guy (joe) over two years ago and at first we were just plain classmates that talked about school. Then one day i signed up for a camping trip, i did not know that he had signed up as well. Any ways we end up going and there i met this one girl (traci, witch goes to  different school than joe and i) that is like my sister now. The thing is that traci and joe started talking and well at first i was like ok that is cool, so they still haven't gotten together after two years because she is focus into getting into a good college, meanwhile joe and i  had a class together my senior year (a year ago, i am now in college) and well we got very close. He got to be my best guy friend he would always tell me he wanted to ask traci out and that he was afraid that she would say no because she is focus in school too much. Well traci would tell me that she wanted to get with him but she didn't have time for him and that if he wanted a long distance relationship than she would say yes. Well n e ways i started falling for him as well, he would call me or i would call him and we would last talking up until 1 am. i had always wanted to tell him that i liked him because i could tell that he felt the same way, but traci is so into him and well she is like my sister so i never said anything until this past valentines day. i decided to tell him but i told him that i couldn't see him any more because it was hurting me too much. so 3 days go by and he sent me a cd and a letter with one of my friends telling me that he would not let me go, so he shows up the next day at my house. i go outside and we talk for a while about a lot of things and then he tells me that he cares about traci but that he cares more about me. then he holds my hand and we stay quiet for the longest time just holding hands. well before i leave he gets me and he kisses me at first i was like no this can't be, but then i give in. i feel totally guilty because i betrayed my friend but then i don't regret what i did. i know that if they ever end up getting together it won't last because for one joe doesn't like long distance relationships and well she is planing to go to college out of state....help what should i do???? i do not want to loose traci but i do not want to let joe go either.       ps: joe and i think that if she goes out of state for college we could wait like 5 months before we get together if we still feel the same way at that time. but that would mean that we would have to wait another whole year ='(

I have this girl in one of my classes and when I sat by her the other day she was flirting a bit with me...she was touching me, gave me eye contact, and just being talkative.  She also made a comment about being alone on valentines day (a few weeks ago) and how she liked it in grade school when everyone would get valentine day cards and stuff .  I thought she was giving me signals and stuff to make a move on her. So I got her number and on valentines day I sent her a text saying happy valentines day.  Then the other day I sent her a few texts and she replies but then when I sent her one saying how we should watch this movie sometime I told her about she doesn't respond.  I am confused because I thought she was giving me all the right signals and stuff but I'm not sure anymore.  What should I do?

20090221000404AAev5lT	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Feeling torn between 2 guys?	Guy A is a person I have only met online a year ago or so, and we have been in an online "relationship" for 6 months. I do not feel extremely physically attracted to him but he is a very mature respectful man. I don't have to worry about him cheating on me or anything like that. he doesn't like to flirt not even with me. But I don't think my parents would approve of him because he is 7 years older than me and I am 19 PLUS he lives in FL and I live in CA.       Guy B I just talked to online but I had a crush on him in highschool...he has been asking me to go to the movies with him..I am very attracted to him, and his personality..he always makes me laugh and he is flirtatious. but I don't think my parents would approve of him, particularly because he is black. :-(       I feel really torn mainly because I've been telling Guy A for so long about how much I care about him and how I want us to work out yet I never really feel that spark. I just wanted some security so bad.  I hate how I lied to him.

20090221000840AAP1j67	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Need some reassurance...please?	Does anyone else on this planet ever just want verification that what they have to offer is worth it to another human being? I've got some great attributes; I'm smart, creative, funny, and I work hard.  Somehow when the outside doesn't even come close to something remotely attractive, everything else doesn't matter. There's always these guys that I like so much and I just know that they'd like me back if I looked better. I know there's no use dwelling...but we live in this world where they say oh, inner beauty is important yet I don't even feel like a real person. I don't blame them for not wanting me. What is your worth as a person if you're just the girl that people settle for? And how the hell do you keep your head up knowing that no matter how hard you work at it, you'll never be what anyone wants?

20090221004828AASe62j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	WOMEN ONLY:  How does a guy go about approaching a girl who is a cashier at a drug store?	I've had my eye on this gorgeous girl who works at a drug store fairly close to my home that I frequent often.  Been scoping her out for a few months, but never attempted anything because I was getting over an ex and wanted to completely avoid getting into a relationship too soon after a break-up.  Now that I'm feeling like I'm ready to get back out on the field, I've started feeling the urge to make a move.      What I'm realizing is that this is a lot more challenging than I thought.  This is one of those drug stores that has a little of everything (one of those chains that you can drop in to get a snack, a card, or a bag of ice), but it's still an in-and-out place where people know exactly what they want - no browsing, no complicated merchandise that needs explaining, and usually very quick lines at the registers.  And of course there's that whole thing about hitting on a girl while she's working...      So I'm in a paradox.        Need to be original and stand-out without being creepy.     Gotta make an impression, but gotta make it quick.     Gotta be appropriate, but at the same time confident and direct.      ...and I haven't asked a girl out in well over a year, so I'm rusty (scoping drug stores isn't my norm either).

In my country and religion a woman's virtue is valued to extremes.  I have no problem being a virgin or maintaining this until I get married, but everyday I am surrounded by people wondering if there is something wrong with me.  Even that movie "never been kissed' had her mark at 25, not 26.  I do want to have a relationship but I was brought up with the idea that the one man I date is the one man I will marry.  I guess I'm scare to meet not such a "great" man and then not being able to enjoy life.  Mind you this has been what I was taught since I can remember.

I met him at the park the day that I moved into my house, and our parents happened to meet the next day. We have been best friends ever since. Me and all of my other friends that I have known since then have grown apart, but we just sort of seem to stick together. And, sometimes, I feel a sort of connection with him.

20090221003423AAMHTCe	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Why does my husband always moan about work?	I have been married for 5 years, and my husband has been in his job for 7 years.  When I met him he was going from job to job doing very undemanding roles eg meter reading etc.  My sister introduced him into her company and he has a secure role which pays the bills and allows me to stay at home with the kids.      Only trouble is every night and every morning for the past 7 years all he does is moan moan moan about the job and to be frank I am fed up listening.  So much so I avoid asking him how his day went etc.  He comes in and fills his face, goes in the bath and then sits preoccupied thinking about work.      I am not sure if I am being selfish but I think he is totally self absorbed.  He barely notices me.  He cant sleep with my snoring so moves to another room and only ever shows an interest in sex on holiday!       I am always trying to boost him up and tell him how well he is doing and I told him today if he is that unhappy in work to take control and look at doing something else,  look at retraining etc,  trouble is I know he wont bother and all I feel is fed up with him      What do you think?

20090221004542AAr4zf6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend is dull in bed - is there anything wrong with her?	My girlfriend only seems to like, simple, basic sex and not that often either.      She isnt keen on oral and doesnt want anal either. She doesnt dress up or go out without wearing knickers. She just doesnt seem to have a higher sex drive as me.      Before anyone asks - I would be perfectly happy to do whatever SHE wanted in bed.      How can I liven her up?

20090221004919AAvOIzy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Quick few questions! important stuff! (sex)?	me and my girlfriend had sex. i had not orgasmed yet but we were done.      she noticed a glob of whitish goo at the base of my penis, however, i was wearing a condom and did not ejaculate. however, the condom was about an inch from the base of my penis (not the whole way down) and it was hanging off of my penis by about an inch and a half when she got off (the condom situation being the reason why we stopped).      she is really worried that she is pregnant, but i keep trying to assure her that it was her vaginal lubricant, not my pre-come. (i have never pre-comed as much as there was there). also, it wasnt feeling THAT GOOD that i think i would have pre-comed because i had gone previously before that.      vaginal lubricant is white and sticky in large amounts, right? stickier than pre-come could be?

20090221005326AAwtpFB	Family & Relationships;Family	What if you were in Iraq and your mother refused to tell you that your grandma was dying in the hospital?	My sis in law was denying my nephew the right to know that his grandmother was gravely ill in the hospital.I happen to think she's a horrible parent.She is a single parent of three. One has already wished her dead, the other isn't too far from wishing and she has one who is only 15 and doesn't even  have a clue about life yet.I'm pretty sure you can guess which one has disowned her by now.Lucky for my nephew he has a really loyal friend who went above and beyond to let him know.Why didn't I tell him? Well...she( sis in law) put a bunch of crap in his head and now he isn't speaking to his uncle and I.She has always been jealous of the fact that my nephews and niece have always looked to me for comfort but she went and ruined it.She causes drama everytime she opens her mouth to anyone.She also said that she wished her mother would hurry up and die so that we could all go on with our lives.She left last night to be at her mother's bedside but she never gave my husband a call to fill him in on what the deal is with his mom.The sad thing is that its only them two.( my hubby and his sis) and they can't even be in the same room for five seconds without her having to be little him for whatever reason.I already know what I think of her but what do you think?

20090221010152AAguXEv	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I handle the fact that my boyfriend thinks I'm fat?	My boyfriend thinks I'm fat even though I don't think I am.  I did gain some weight, however.  When I met him, I was 108 pounds.  Now I'm about 120 pounds.  He brings my weight up often (but not every day) and asks me to work out more.  However, I am a student studying an extremely hard major at a very diffucult university.  I devote 99% of my time to studying and don't really have time to work out like I used to.  I know that our relationship sounds terrible, but other than the weight issue, our relationship is almsot perfect.  I love him a lot, and I know he loves me.  So if any of you ladies have been in the same situation, how did you get past the weight issue?

And when a girl is trying to communicate with me, I don't know what to say.

20090221012455AAtaED6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is it possible to fall in love with someone you met online? Love strong enough to get married?	I thought I'd ask this since i just met a guy on valentines day via the internet. And we've really hit it off and everything & exchanged numbers & now were meeting in a few weeks for date.    So what's your opinion? Do you think its possible to fall in love after you've met the person face to face?
20090221012457AAztXTx	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Should I discuss marriage more seriously with bf? Opinions?	We are young (21 and 23), but he has always talked to me about wanting to have kids before he hits his 30s. We both graduate in April 2010, and he has expressed his concern about being able to find a job in the finance industry (considering the economic recession). Right now, we both work part time and go to school full time, so I know the only thing is whether or not he can afford the ring, the wedding, and getting married.       Clues:   - he once said that if he had a million dollars, he would buy me a diamond ring (he's very concerned about finances)   - he asked me the other day "how much do you think I love you?" After my response, he asked me "do you love me enough to marry me?" And then he said "is there any reason that you wouldn't marry me?"    - he brought up suddenly re-meeting my parents in april, also taking a day trip to seattle in april as well (in a semi-serious tone)   - he asked me "what kind of wedding do you want?, "how big of a wedding do you want"? (maybe to gauge costs)   - he has asked me "how long do engagement periods usually last?" (he knows that i want to wait at least 3 years before having kids, and he wants kids before he turns 29)   - today we were watching tyra channel surfing, and as soon as a proposal segment came on, he started searching for topics to talk about (purposely trying to steer me away from watching)   - he has asked what kind of a ring I would like   - he keeps talking about his boss and his happy marriage   - he is definitely over the partying lifestyle (been through it in his teens)   - he knows I am against living together before marriage. Once he mentioned he would like to move in with me      The thing is, if he proposes this year, and our engagement is about a year, we'll be married right after graduation (at 22 and 24). I work in the wedding industry and I told him that now, a lot of couples need at least a year to get the desired venue, so stretch that out to 2 years and that makes us 23 and 25. (He once did say he wouldn't mind being married at 25).       It seems like I am overanalyzing this, but it is because I really need to be prepared to expect it, and to gauge whether or not I am ready to be married so young. I know we have what it takes to make it (good communication, strong attraction, similar values, attitude towards making relationship work), but I want to make sure that marriage to him doesn't mean settling into a life of boredom and monotony. I want to be married to him, but only if it means creating our life together.      Every time we talk about it, he's the one who brings it up, and usually I don't approach it too seriously, sometimes joking, because I don't want it to seem like all I want is to get married and scare him off. And plus, usually I am caught off guard that he seems to be thinking about it. I think I should discuss it more seriously with him.
20090221012946AArUUtc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I'm confused and really need some help?	i'm bi and there is this guy and girl i like but i'm not sure if either of them like me       for one i don't know if the guy is gay, straight, or bi but he got pissed when i said that i thought this girl was cute and has been giving me the cold shoulder ever since.      I really like him but we are in high school i don't think it is best to try and talk to him. If he does like me that would be great because maybe we could work things out.      On the other side the girl i like is really chill and cute but i don't think i'm her type.we get along well but i don't know if i should ask her out or him.      I'm not out about my sexuality because people make too much of a big deal out of things so I don't know how to go about things.
20090221013447AAp1Suj	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Somehow, a question only for women to answer?	To keep a long story short, I've been staying away from my girlfriend all week because of a huge issue dat broke down the night before valentine's day when my homeboi found a way to convince me that she was possibly cheatin on me. After a week has gone by, I decided to use another friend phone today to text her (i just couldn't resist) and pretend i was somebody else just to see if she would talk to em. but the only thing i got was the fact that she wasn't really to talk to em and she told the person ( which was really me but she aint kno dat) that she already had a boyfriend and wen i asked her if it was alrite if i asked her wat her bf name was, she said my name. so my question is, considering the fact that i never actually broke up with her in the first place and she never really found out that i was taking a break from her to have my space to think, do i just go about it as if nothing ever happened or do i explain to her the truth of why i havent really been contacting her for da whole week until now?
20090221013632AAEM7YC	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Sex? What happens if...?	okay my friend adriana finally has sex with her boyfriend (which i think is a bad idea because they have only been dating for about four months and were only 14 years old and hes 16) but anyways they decide to finally do it and after it was over she came out with a bad expression on her face. later on when we go home she tells me that it felt good and that it wasn't her first time and that the only thing that was bothering her was first five seconds her boyfriend realizes that hes not wearing a condom and that she just couldn't feel a difference. so he quickly puts one on. that really doesn't cause anything to happen like pregnancy does it? i mean shes just so irresponsible.
20090203114141AArlDtm	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How Do I Know When it is Really Over?	My marriage, I mean. We have been married for over 10 years. I am not sure what I am doing anymore. He talks to me, but it is like I am a stranger. ( I must add I am not ready to give up yet. I started to a few years back and found out he was just angry when saying certain things.) He tells me he loves me, but he is often working a lot on purpose to stay away. I am trying so hard to be here for him when he talks to me, which is almost every night. He talks to me like he used to, like I am his best friend. Yes, we have been through a lot. A whole lot. I don't want to push him away and I know that is possible. I did that a few years ago.    I do love him and I know he loves me, but I do not think he is in love with me anymore. Can we still make it work with that?    All the same, he also seems to be looking. He looks at every woman he meets and wonders if it could be someone for or like him. This bothers me so much. I don't want to give up yet I don't want to keep beating at the door if he will not let me in.    And also, does his words in anger mean anything at all or is he just expressing his anger?

I just don't get it because he said he still wanted to be friends. He's just started dating again and now I don't even talk to him.      Guys do you just want nothing to do with girls you dated in the past? Also when you start dating again does that mean you don't want to have female friends?

20090221014532AAM5xZ0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	GUYS: What do you think he feels?	How am i suppose to know how he feels, when he wont say anything?   I went out with my current boyfriend for 4 months and then we broke up. Within those 4 months he told he loved me. our relationship was more of a strong attraction then verbal, but no sex. we were broken up for a year. i am 16, he is 17. he asked me back out a few days ago because he still likes me. He is the hardest person to read.. even his friends tell me that he is so complicated to know exactly what he is thinking. He doesnt talk to me much but we both adore eachother. maybe its because ive been his only girlfriend and he doesn't know how to act.    What do you think he is doing asking me out a year after we broke up(we haven't talked, only have some classes together).    GUYS, what do you think he is feeling? What does it mean when a guy says he loves you?

20090221022454AANnEud	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	She doesn't want a relationship?	so there's this girl that I've been hanging out with at my community college alot. Twice a week all day.      she made it very obvious that she likes me.   she would always lay her head on mine,   and lay on me. of course she was very flirty too.      nothing seemed to be going wrong,   but the last time I saw her she was acting kind of different.   almost like she was purposely trying to be mean or something.   she left with her friend briefly and told me she'd be right back,   that lead me to believe she wanted to discuss something about me with her friend privately.      when she returned (she didn't bring it up right away), she told me that she sucks at relationships and doesn't want a boyfriend right now. She also said after this, "I don't know what I'm trying to say"      when she left campus she told me to call her tonight,   which makes me think she still wants to talk to me?      does this mean she doesn't like me anymore or changed her mind about me?      or does this mean she's unsure about me and wants me as a friend for while/playing hard to get?      inform me, I'm totally lost!       I really like her   and I'm not sure if I should move on,   or wait and be her friend for now (which could cause alooot of hurt if she doesn't end up wanting anything with me in the long run)

This girl (who’s stunningly beautiful), told me all her insecurities, problems, history. Then she wanted to sleep with me, because she felt so close to me.       Every man in her past (family, friends, lovers) have all messed her around. They take advantage of her weaknesses when she trusts them or tells things, they give her comfort, usually just to sleep with her.       I don’t want to be like those men. I can actually get rid of her problems. But if I sleep with her I feel as if I’m taking advantage too. but I also wanna be her boyfriend cause I think I can love & take care fo her like no one else has.

During this time, My husband and I have been living in his flat that he jointly owns with his parents. His parents live elsewhere, but the flat we live in is in my husband's name and both his parents' names.       During our two year marriage I have paid for all the bills by setting up a direct debit on my bank account, whereby 200 pounds are transferred to my husband's account every month. We have a year old baby daughter.       Our marriage is falling apart and we are considering separating with a view to divorce. Would I be entitled to anything, as during our two year marriage, I paid 200 pounds per month to my husband so that he could pay the bills?

20090203114000AAaKmCA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this situation?	Alright, so there's this bean bag store in my local mall called "Love Sac" and my friend is OBSESSED with sitting on them in the store...so we went in...and there were cute guys working there...so the one that I liked said hi to us...then we went back later and he came over and was like "You guys are back!?" and I was like "Yeah..."   So then we left, but then I had my guy friend go over and talk to him and apparently the conversation went as follows:      "Hey, my friend over there thinks you're kinda cute"   "Oh, yeah? How old is she?"   "17"   "I'm 18, going on 19...is she hot?"   "Well, why don't you see for yourself..."   "Alright, bring her over"      So then he waved me over and our convo went as follows:      "Hey, I'm Amanda"   "I'm Justin"   "So what's up?"   "Eh, nothing...where are you from?"   "Rochelle Park, it's a town over from here...how about you?"   "Elmwood Park"   "Cool, cool"   "What school do you go to?"   "Bergen Academies"   "I think I knew someone that went there..."   "Oh, really, who?"   [insert name here] (wasn't really paying attention)   "Hmm...don't think I know her...alright, well...I guess I'll see you then"      Then I walked away, and pulled a pen and paper out of my purse and wrote down my number and underlined my named and walked back into the store and handed it to him while saying, "Here, in case you want it"      Then his friend who worked there with him was clapping and said, "Yeah! That's the way to do it!"...it was amazingly funny      This happened Saturday, now it's Tuesday...he has yet to contact me, but he seemed like a really nice guy and interested from what I could tell. What should I do? Wait longer? If he doesn't contact me, should I go back to the store and talk to him? He was a seriously nice guy! Thanks for your help!
20090221020839AApYGuc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My cousin kissed this guy but she has a bf.?	So me my friends and my two cousin are out (its my cousins 18th) Anywayss... Its all us girls having a good time, when some group of guys come and start dancing with us, My cousin recognizes one of the guys from school or something and she dances with him.....      She dances with him like goofy to begin with but then she gets more close, Anyways... She pecks him on the lips then about 5Min's later all the guys leave.    When they were gone i asked her if she liked him and she said no, she said she didn't know why she kissed him and it didn't mean anything.      But I`m not sure...? I mean she has been with her bf for a couple of months and hes a great guy, the whole family like him and he seems to fit in with us really well, I duno whether I should tell him or not?      I love my cousin and don't want to annoy her (to put it lightly) by telling her Jay (her bf), I`m not sure wether it was something serious or not?   She was at the end dancing with him quite flirty but we all were dancing like that with the guys, apart from me and my friends are single...      should I tell Jay and *P155* My cousin off?

20090221014013AA1DtbU	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	How do i get my life back on track?	so... this year has started off pretty badly for me. first, i got in a lot of trouble for drug related things (which i hadn't done for a long time)... then, 2 weeks after that, my longtime girlfriend dumped me for an unrelated reason. and now i can't really hang out with any of my old friends because they all do drugs and i have to stay away from that. so i have no friends, no girlfriend, and no life at all really. i've always been good at dating/girls and i've been on a few since then, but so far, they've only made me miss my ex more. there is really no chance of us getting back together. i've always been shy so its kind of hard to make new friends and i'm still not really over my ex and it's been almost a month. lame? haha   and i don't know, this may sound bad, but i really don't feel comfortable unless i'm in a relationship.       right now i'm just trying to stay out of trouble and not go insane. any ideas on how to make new friends, find a new girl, and focus on more positive things?      and i'm 16 if it makes any difference.

20090221015234AADrJ00	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would you take chance?	I'm not the biggest risk taker there is, but I'm asking if I should take a risk. Theres this guy and he isn't technically with the girl but they like each other. He's been avoiding so he won't like me.   Like one time we hung up. I called back telling him that I wasn't finished talking, that I wanted to hear goodnight.    He asked why was I doing everything right, why am I making his life hard and that I blindsighted him from his target (the other girl) which he waited four months for and they are finally clicking.   But back to the present. He will barely talk to me if he sees me, won't respond to my texts, or call.    I know I should leave him alone, but should I take a risk and give it one more try? I have nothing to loose right?   Or should I let go because I'll just be wasting my time?      Thanks.

20090221021836AAC5ngw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guy asked me out for a date, but just wants to sleep with me...?	This guy, who's a friend but to whom I'm not that close, has asked me out to coffee. I had a bit of a drunken thing with him a few weeks ago - just kissing - but I don't want a relationship with him because:   a) He just wants to sleep with me. I know this because my friend overheard him on the phone to his mate saying how I was 'up for it' and he was sure to 'get some'. Nice.   b) He cheated on his ex.   c) He's at the same Cambridge college as me, so things could get messy.      But I still want him as a friend. What should I reply to his text asking me out for coffee?      Thanks for your advice.
20090221021858AA1VsaH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help me im a heart broken beauty?	Hi girls, i am a little confused and need help figuring this out. I like this guy named John and so does my friend Jenna. Heres the deal:   We kind of both just met john, and the other night john invited me out to this concert close to my house, and after the concert we shared our first kiss...it came out of no where (we were both kind of drunk) but not to the point where we didnt know what was going on. Anyway, so last night was John's best friend Erick's birthday and me and Jenna both went because we kind of all hang out with the same group of friends....Jenna found out about the kiss from Erick and she kind of looked upset because i think she likes him too. She seemed so jealous and she kept coming up with reasons why John is not for me, like she is all "he is such a player, and he likes mature girls etc." The whole night last night i wanted to have some alone time with John but Jenna kept literally tugging me away and like we ended up going to some random bars (she was like doing everything in her power to get me away from him) He was even putting his arm around me and she got jealous and like pulled me away. Anyway, later that night we all get back to Ericks house and on the ride back she loures John in the balcony and starts flirting with him and like grabbing him all flirty and ****. It really pissed me off because she knows i like him and she was the one who told me in the first place that she is looking for someone so different from John. I couldnt handle being there because they both looked so in to eachother and i just couldnt be there so i left when no one was looking. What would u have done if u were me, would u have stayed?   The part that makes me sad is i think john is falling for jenna because she has had soo much one on one time with him and like everytime he comes to talk to me she like magically finds a way to make me disappear.   Help me! i feel so heart broken =(
20090221022012AACEfA7	Family & Relationships;Friends	My boyfriend says ecorny things more and more these days and jokes that are so obscure people never really ge?	People and even old friends look at him oddly and it kind of makes a lot of conversations awkward and if I am there I sometimes feel like I need to clarify or just sort of ignore whats going on cause sometimes I feel like he needs to deal with  things on his own.  I don't know how to feel about this, or what to do.  He did not always used to be this awkward or corny and random.  I feel bad for feeling embarrassed about situations.  I don't want to hurt his feelings, I love him a lot.  We've been together for 10 years.

20090221023418AAiv5Zy	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	How do you win the love of your wife's heart back?	My wife has moved out from our home. Aroungd Aug 2008 she told me how unhappy she was and quit our marriage. Up until then I had no idea there were any problems between us. There is no abuse, alcoholism, gambling or affaris.   We have always been best friends and as of Feb 2009 we have been together for 17 years.   I have been in therapy since the moment she left and have improved on "my areas of imperfection(s)". She told me that I was distant and absent over the past few years. I have been trying to win her heart back, but nothing seems to work. I am more attentive in every area. I am a GREAT FATHER, a GOOD PERSON and thought I was a GOOD HUSBAND. I had no idea... We have two (2) little girls who want their mommy and daddy back together again.   Please help a good man to win the love of his wife, a good woman.

20090203113955AAeJmDs	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Can you explain this disturbing dream I had?	Over the last few months,I am constantly having a disturbing dream. I am walking in a block of flats and I hear some people talking in the hall. When I pass by them, I see it is my wife and my best friend. They do not seem to notice me, then I see he is kissing her and my wife is also kissing him back. Then they are in bed and they are having wild sex. From her body expression I can see she is really loving it. She is moaning so loud I can hear her across the room. At one time, she sees me and smiles and proceeds to have oral sex on him. At first, I am shocked, but I then find myself not wanting to interrupt. I am in fact really excited just seeing her do that to my best friend. Sometimes I wake up with the feeling that the dream is so real and I am shocked and sexually aroused at the same time. Can anybody provide an explanation for this dream?
