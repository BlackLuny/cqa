4db07412ef2c09f8393cb86bf7e153deaa	The limit of a function is basically just the value that it approaches when one of its variables is approaching some other value.<br>  <br>  For example, lim[x -> 3] (x^2), which is read as "the limit of x^2 as x approaches 3" is 9.  This is because as x takes on values that are closer and closer to 3, then x^2 takes on values that are closer and closer to 9.<br>  <br>  In this particular case, the limit doesn't tell us anything special.  Obviously x^2 is going to be close to 9 when x is close to 3, because 3^2 = 9.  But what if you had something like<br>  lim [x->1] (x)/(√x - 1) ?<br>  <br>  You can't just plug 1 into the expression, because that gives you 1/0 which doesn't make any sense since you can't divide by 0. The limit can tell us where the graph of y = x / (√x - 1) is going when x=1.|`|Gg9bK7caaa	Limits are close approximations at a particular given value.<br>  Sometimes we can directly plug that number into the function, other times we can't.<br>  <br>  We have 3 kinds of lmits: left side (-), right side (+), and both side (-)<br>  Teachers in calculus talk about limits, because the goal is to be able to link algebra to calculus. The tangent line requires two points to find the slope of the line. As those two points get very, very close together (limit Δx-->0), we no longer have to use two points to determine a slope,. We created some thing called an instantaneous slope found through the derivative.<br>  <br>  Here is a few examples.<br>  <br>  1.) Find the lim x-->3 (x^2-9)/(x-3)<br>  <br>  Clearly we can't substitute 3 in for x, because the denominator would be equal to 0.<br>  <br>  Let's simplify.<br>  <br>  (x^2- 9)(x-3) = [(x+3)(x-3)]/(x-3)= x+3<br>  <br>  lim x-->3 (x^2-9)/(x-3) = lim x-->3 (x+3) = 3+3=6<br>  <br>  The point (3,6) doesn't exist but its limit does.around x =3<br>  lim x-->3 (x^2-9)/(x-3) = 6<br>  <br>  2.) Find the lim x-->0- (1/x)<br>  Again we can't substitute x=0 into (1/x), 1/0 isn't defined.<br>  <br>  But its limit does.  lim x-->0- (1/x)<br>  <br>  To get an idea what really is happening, pick a number less than 0, but close to 0. Say, x=-1/100<br>  <br>  Substitute x= =-1/100 in for x. Remember this is the reciprocal function.<br>  1/(-1/100) = -100<br>  <br>  Pick another number. Say x= -1/100000<br>  Substitute x= =-1/100000 in for x. Remember this is the reciprocal function.<br>  1/(-1/100000) = -100000<br>  <br>  What is happening?<br>  <br>  As we get closer to 0 from the left side (-), the number becomes a larger negative number.<br>  <br>  As we get extremely close, the output approaches -∞<br>  <br>  Hence, lim x-->0- (1/x) = -∞.<br>  <br>  3.) Find lim x-->0 (1/x).<br>   We  can do a similar argument from the previous example for the (right) side of 0 (+)<br>  <br>  Lim x-->0+ (1/x) = +∞. <br>  <br>  But lim x-->0- (1/x) ≠ lim x-->0+ (1/x), because -∞.≠+∞.<br>  <br>  Therefore, the lim x->0 (1/x) does not exists.

UFteXlqwaa	The "curving of the planetary winds" (strange way to put it but ... okay) is the result of the Coriolis effect, which is the result of the earth's rotation. That's right.<br>  <br>  The trade winds converge toward the equator, a region of warmth and humidity because of low pressure and associated precipitations. That's right.<br>  <br>  I would say that what contributes most to the climate of a region is:<br>  1) its latitude, which determines its temperature and precipitation (tropical and temperature belts are low pressure with precipitations. Polar and subtropical regions are high pressure and very dry.)<br>  <br>  2) its proximity to an ocean. Maritime and continental climates are very different.<br>  <br>  Good luck.

buLqy1b3aa	I believe that, for the proof, you need to get the answer in the form of x = A + Bcos(wt).  And, unless I'm mistaken, you have a sine sqaured term.<br>  <br>  You need to use Trig identities to convert the sine squared into the cosine term you're looking for.  Specifically:<br>  cos(2x) = cos^2(x) - sin^2(x)<br>  cos(2x) = (1 - sin^2(x)) - sin^2(x), by Pythagorean Theorem<br>  <br>  sin^2(x) = 1/2(1 - cos(2x)), I think this is right.
3ZPYB7nxaa	Besides cleaning the forest floor of debris which block light for seedlings, fires also provide minerals needed for the seedlings to grow. Plants need fertilizers, the 3 major nutirents are Nitrogen, Phosphorus and Potassium. Nitrogen is ordinarily a gas, and burns away with the debris. However, the Potassium and Phosphorus are released from the burned material and become available to the seedlings. Plants also require small amounts of minerals such as Iron, Molybdnium and Manganeese. Fungi which grow on plant roots release these nutrients from the soil by acidifying it with enzymes. However, seedlings have tiny roots and get a boost from the minerals the burned material releases directly into the soil. <br>  <br>  FYI: Caustic potash (Potassium hydroxide) was traditionally recovered from wood ashes. This was then used to make soap from animal fat.|`|z0GqpcvPaa	very dangerous for hill site residents

While there, Newton, according to his own words, considered the problem of planetary motion and focused on coming up with a theory to explain the motion of the moon around the earth. Newton's view, for which there is considerable doubt, is that he had at hand all the information to consider a thought experiment in which the same gravitational force that pulls a falling apple to the ground could be the same force that holds the moon in orbit around the earth. In fact, most of the information Newton needed was not clearly dilineated until after 1675, but the thought experiment is impressive and informative nonetheless. It begins with Newton's statement<br>  "as the power [of gravity] is not found sensibly diminished at the remotest distance from the center of the Earth to which we can rise, neither at the tops of the loftiest buildings, not even the summits of the highest mountains; it appeared reasonable to conclude that this power must extend much further than is usually thought; why not as high as the Moon; and if so, her motion must be influenced by it; perhaps she is retained in her orbit thereby." <br>  <br>  The thought experiment begins with Kepler's third law applied to circular orbits. It continues with Christian Huygen's publication, in 1673, of the formula for the centripetal acceleration of a body in a circular orbit, ar = 4*Pi2r/T2. By 1679, Robert Hooke, Edmund Hillary, and Christopher Wren had shown that, for a circular orbit, the force delivering the centripetal acceleration must have a strength which is proportional to 1/r2 to fit in with Kepler's Third Law for planetary orbits. This is easy to see. Consider a point object with a mass m, a non-zero, constant velocity and a centripetal force acting on it toward a central body as shown below.<br>  We have ar = v2/r. The period of the circular orbit must be T = 2*Pi*r/v, therefore,<br>  ar = v2/r <br>   = 4*Pi2r2/(r*T2) <br>  ar = 4*Pi2r/T2 <br>  <br>  This result from Huygen can be combined with Kepler's 3rd Law, T2 = kr3, to show that the force providing ar must vary as 1/r2<br>  Fcentral = mar <br>   = m[4*Pi2r/(kr3)] <br>  Fcentral = 4*Pi2m/(kr2) <br>  <br>  So the central force is proportional to 1/r2. The 1/r2 form is also reasonable from the isotropy of space argument presented in the text. <br>  <br>  With the knowledge that, at least for circular orbits, the central force must vary as 1/r2 and knowledge that the distance from the center of the earth to the center of the moon is about 60 earth radii, Newton could perform the quick calculation that the acceleration toward the center of the earth of an apple near the surface of the earth is consistent with the moon being attracted to the center of the earth by the same force, as long as that force varies as 1/r2. Say that the magnitude of the acceleration a body experiences due to the gravitational attraction of the earth is ar = kearth/r2 where r is the distance from the center of the earth. Then kearth = arr2. For the apple, r = Rearth = 6.37 x 106 m. For the moon, r = Re-m = 60Rearth. Therefore, if the same earth is responsible for the motion of a falling apple and the curved orbit of the moon, then aappleRearth2 = amoonRe-m(60Rearth)2, so, using our established connection between centripetal acceleration and period of orbit, we find<br>  aappleRearth2 = amoonRe-m(re-m)2 ==>  <br>  gRearth2 = [4*Pi2re-m/Tmoon2] (re-m)2 <br>  gRearth2 = [4*Pi2/Tmoon2] (60Rearth)3 ==>  <br>  T2 = [4*Pi2/g](60)3Rearth ==>  <br>  T = sqrt[4*Pi2/(10 m/s2)] (60)3(6.4 x 106 m)] <br>   = 2.34 x 106 s (1 day/86400 s) <br>  T = 27.1 days <br>  The actual sidereal time for one complete lunar orbit is 27.3 days so Newton's guess about gravity being the same force that causes the motion of a falling apple and the orbiting moon looks to be correct or, in Newton's words,<br>  "I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centers about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the Moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the Earth; and found them answer pretty nearly." <br>  <br>  This is a remarkable advance! Newton has shown that the same laws of motion that we study on earth are applicable to the motions of bodies far beyond the environs of earth. Laboratory experiments here can be used to deduce theories of nature which are universally applicable. <br>  The remaining things for Newton to do to come up with a complete theory of gravity were non-trivial. First, he had to be clear in his notions about his second and third laws of motion (he had already a clear concept of inertia), he had to reconcile his results with the fact that the orbits of moons and planets are not circular, but elliptical as Kepler had shown, he had to deal with the "action-at-a-distance" issue, and he had to correctly deal with mass as a generator of gravitational force.

The brain activity of animals, for example, has everything to do with reality (eat, sleep, drink, danger, etc.) But something must've happened to the human brain, since we can think of things that have nothing to do with reality and are not beneficial to our survival in any way. It's probably a byproduct of developing complex brain.<br>  <br>  One hypothesis for the evolution of human imagination is that it allowed conscious beings to solve problems (and hence increase an individual's fitness) by use of mental simulation.

As the result, a human being can fantasise about things that break the laws of physics, things which are impossible to achieve in reality.<br>  <br>  But of course, a few centuries ago a flying craft or a robot would seem like fantasy, yet we have them now.

Now if a red light is added to the green area, the reflected light will be yellow, and if blue is then added to this yellow light it will relect as white light.

PwHQSAxvaa	It is a hydrocarbon organic compound. The main types in alcoholic drinks are ethanol and methanol. It is a by-product of yeast consuming sugar.<br>  <br>  The type of alcohol produced depends on two factors. First is the type of sugar and yeast strain. The sugar could be maltose in beer, or fructose in wine. Sometimes sucrose is added, normal processed sugar, or glucose chips, to increase alcohol yield, though this results in a thinner product, whereas just using the one type keeps the integrity of the drink with adequate yield.<br>  <br>  The next important factor is cleanliness. Brewing equipment needs to be scrupulously clean and sterile, or the type of alcohol yielded may be one which your body does not handle very well.|`|msNXomjTaa	Alcohol is basically yeast pee!<br>  <br>  Yeast eat sugar, and excrete alcohol, which is chemically C2 H5 OH.<br>  <br>  To make it, you need a source of sugar, and yeast.

Beer brewing works a similar way, but the hops and bitters makes a different flavour, and a different yeast is used.<br>  <br>  But, basically, sugar + yeast = alcohol, up to a maximum of just under 20%, where they die in their own pee.|`|tX2giFynaa	Q: What is Alcohol?<br>  Ans: Alcohol is a drug which has the immediate effectis of altering the mood and senses whilst also affecting physical co-ordination. Drinking also makes people feel relaxed and in a lot of cutures, is enjoyed socially when in fact, alcohol is a depressant.<br>  <br>  Alcohol is a compound of oxygen, carbon and hydrogen which is produced when glucose is fermented by yeast. Every alcoholic drink has an alcoholic content ( ABN%)- some more than others, which is controlled by the quantity of yeast and the length of time it has been fermented.<br>  <br>  Q: How is it made?<br>  The present invention relates to a method of preparing an alcohol by reducing a carboxylic acid or a derivative thereof, more particularly, a method of preparing an alcohol by a reduction reaction in the presence of a zirconium-titanium oxide catalyst. A carboxylic acid or a carboxylic acid derivative is converted into a corresponding alcohol by a reduction reaction in the presence of a zirconium-titanium oxide catalyst using an alcohol as a hydrogen source. An alcohol can be prepared in a high yield in the present invention. To be more specific, the method of the present invention can convert a higher fatty acid or a carboxylic acid derivative, which has given a corresponding alcohol in a low yield in the presence of a zirconium catalyst alone, into the corresponding alcohol in a high yield. Further, the reaction can be performed easily, and the product can be easily separated from the catalyst.|`|kx72wqp3aa	In chemistry, an alcohol is any organic compound in which a hydroxyl group (-OH) is bound to a carbon atom of an alkyl or substituted alkyl group.

23hPHjOqaa	Every imaginable branch of medicine you can think of has a specialist somewhere, however some of the major ones I have detailed below for you.<br>  <br>  Anaesthesiologist - Once thought to be very good at math, these days they carry a calculator. Specialist in drugs providing anaesthesia and sometimes analgesia including local anaesthetics, general anaesthetics and conversation. They are also experts in airway management, such as intubation. Are a critical part of the trauma team and the surgical team.<br>  <br>  Barometrics - These doctors deal with a new specialty that is; without being rude - the overweight.<br>  <br>  Cardiologist - Heart doctors, know a lot about the heart and want you to know they know a lot about the heart. The last breed to not realise that wearing a bow tie makes them look like an idiot.<br>  <br>  Dermatologist - They work with the largest organ of them all...the skin. They look at rashes and give them a Latin name to sound cleaver and then prescribe steroids.<br>  <br>  Emergency Physicians - What I hope to specialise in, the Golden secret of medicine. Doesn't pay as well as General Practitioners but its a good wage, plus when you work shifts you usually won't be called back in again unless something really major happens. The cutting edge of the frontline of medicine dealing with anything and everything that appears through those doors. Not your average 9-5, know what patients your going to see with what conditions on what wards day, more like a don't know whats going to happen in the next 5 minutes and what I am going to have to deal with day...but I'm ranting.<br>  <br>  Geriatricians - Unsung heroes of the NHS, they work with the older people, they see a massive amount of patients, and act in a pragmatic way by treating the patient not the sign and symptoms. Sometimes it's hard to tell the patient from the doctor.<br>  <br>  General Medical Doctors (Internists) - Treat those patients with "medical conditions" such as pneumonia and heart failure. Like to organise a lot of tests, the more expensive the better.<br>  <br>  Gynaecologist - I shouldn't really need to explain but the Heineken of doctors lol.<br>  <br>  Opthalmologists - Eye specialists, prescribe chloramphenicol for everything.<br>  <br>  Oncologists - Cancer doctors, sung heroes of the NHS.<br>  <br>  Orthopaedic Surgeons - Known as the carpenters of the medical world through their mending of broken bones and replacing joints, they take pride in knowing as little medicine as possible and are often the butt of medical jokes, replace the word blonde/irish with orthopod and the joke is usually funny to doctors. Example - What is the definition of a double blind trial? Two orthopods looking at an ECG.<br>  <br>  Plastic Surgeons - As trainees they spend a lot of time dealing with nasty burns. As a consultant they make money out of peoples low self-esteem.<br>  <br>  Paediatricians - Work with children, generally nice, wear colourful ties.<br>  <br>  Psychiatrists - Usually deal with the mentally ill. Generally poor taste in clothes - sandels and tweed, Use pharases such as erotic counter transferance to describe that they thought their last patient was attractive.<br>  <br>  Nephrologist - Kidneydoctors, extremely smart but a little dull. Can understand as well as pronounce words like glomerulonephritis.<br>  <br>  Urologists - Deal with the bladder and all that urine flows through. Also look after kindey stone patients.<br>  <br>  Rheumatologist - Deal with the joints and musculoskeletal system. Give you tablets for arthritis, when these stop working they send you to the orthopods.<br>  <br>  Respiratory Specialists - Know a lot about chests, lungs, breathing etc... Like to titter when they say to patients big breaths - at this point DO NOT EVER say "Why thank you Doctor" and play with your hair.<br>  <br>  Radiologists - Doctors who specialise looking at X-Rays and scans. <br>  <br>  There are many, many more but I don't really have the time to explain them all.|`|v1Y3dvjgaa	Only you can decide that.

Of the possible choices of two,<br>  24C2 = 276 <br>  will produce acceptance.<br>  <br>  That's a 276/435 probability of acceptance. (That equals 552/870; you're getting the larger numbers because someone calculated using permutations instead of combinations. Both approaches produce equal results.)<br>  <br>  Probability that the first camera chosen is defective: There are six defective cameras out of 30, so the probability is<br>  6/30 = 1/5<br>  <br>  Again, the answer given is equal but indicates someone calculated it by a different method.

W2suykEtaa	I 100% agree with you that the Big Bang didn't "just happen".<br>  <br>  you are fooling yourself if you seriously think saying "causal impetus" in your case isn't thin camouflage for "The Hand of God".<br>  <br>  remember, the more we learn about the Universe, the less mumbo-jumbo about gods are required to fill in the gaps.  True, the "time" before the Big Bang is a mystery... but that is really no reason to throw out the whole theory, just because we cannot yet (or perhaps ever) explain that "causal impetus".<br>  <br>  you cannot equate "not knowing" with "superstition".  Everyone is born ignorant, and the process of learning doesn't decrease the level of superstition.  Belief in religions and gods is separate from knowledge.  No better evidence of this than the reduction of god's role from "he turns the heavens and hauls the sun across the sky" to... causal impetus.|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	No.  The big bang is supported by observational evidence.  Religious beliefs are necessarily beliefs because they have nothing to support them - belief is it.  Science doesn't rely on belief - believe it or not, it still works.  There's evidence to support it.  The big bang happened even if we don't know what started it, and it doesn't rely on what started it to have happened.|`|Nf60Q6UFaa	The hot big bang scientific theory does not deal with the "causal impetus" it goes "back" in time to a very small fraction of second AFTER the big bang.

The surface of a sphere is not infinite, yet it has no edges. If you were a flat 2D person living on that world, it would look infinite to you. Everywhere you looked and everywhere you went, there'd be more and more space. But in a higher dimension (the 3rd), that space is curved onto itself, making a sphere.<br>  <br>  Likewise, the Universe is thought to be finite but unbounded. To us, 3-dimensional beings, it seems infinite because it has no edges. But that's only because our perception is bound to the 3-dimensional space, and there are more dimensions believed to exist.<br>  <br>  Have a look at this video. Carl Sagan explains a few things about the Universe and dimensions: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KT4M7kiSw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9KT4M7ki...</a><br>  <br>  As for the expansion of the Universe, it simply means that every point in space is moving away from each other. Imagine that the sphere in my example above is expanding like a balloon. It's obviously expanding in 3-dimensional space, but the 2-dimensional surface of the sphere is also expanding. If you were to make a few points on the surface with a marker pen, you'd observe that all of these points are moving away from each other. If you'd pick one of the points as "central", you'd see that all surrounding points are moving away from it. But that would be the case for any point you pick as "central". Surface of a sphere doesn't have a centre, because it has no edged and no absolute point of reference.<br>  <br>  Likewise, when we look at the surrounding galaxies in the Universe, we see them moving away from us (with a few exceptions of the closest ones). But it's only because our viewpoint is fixed to our own galaxy. Pick any other galaxy as your point of view, and you will see exactly the same: all surrounding galaxies moving away from you.|`|OilQvoLZaa	It's shaped like a doughnut...seriously, think about it.|`|G6t2O9Kmaa	Nobody knows for for sure.

This magnetic field is invisible but is responsible for the most notable property of a magnet: a force that pulls on other ferromagnetic materials and attracts or repels other magnets.<br>  <br>  A permanent magnet is one that stays magnetized, such as a magnet used to hold notes on a refrigerator door. Materials which can be magnetized, which are also the ones that are strongly attracted to a magnet, are called ferromagnetic. These include iron, nickel, cobalt, some rare earth metals and some of their alloys, and some naturally occurring minerals such as lodestone. Permanent magnets are made from "hard" ferromagnetic materials which are designed to stay magnetized, while "soft" ferromagnetic materials like soft iron are attracted to a magnet but do not tend to stay magnetized.<br>  <br>  An electromagnet is made from a coil of wire which acts as a magnet when an electric current passes through it, but stops being a magnet when the current stops. Often an electromagnet is wrapped around a core of ferromagnetic material like steel, which enhances the magnetic field produced by the coil.<br>  <br>  Although ferromagnetic materials are the only ones strongly enough attracted to a magnet to be commonly considered "magnetic", all other substances respond weakly to a magnetic field, by one of several other types of magnetism. Paramagnetic materials, such as aluminum and oxygen are weakly attracted to a magnet. Diamagnetic materials, such as carbon and water, which include all substances not having another type of magnetism, are weakly repelled by a magnet.<br>  <br>  The overall strength of a magnet is measured by its magnetic moment, while the local strength of the magnetism in a material is measured by its magnetization.<br>  :D hope this helps x|`|4283c6ea8e856476bcccc6289e6452adaa	As it turns out according the discovery channel, a lot of things will react to a magnetic field if it's strong enough.

9ib0tC9Waa	Microevolution is not a theory, it has been tested and observed, Unlike the theory of macroevolution, it is fact.
AA11513203	First, lets look at how those prefixes micro- and macro- are used in other concepts and other fields. The terms microevolution and macroevolution *as used by scientists* are like terms like microbiology vs. macrobiology ... or microgrowth vs. macrogrowth ... or microeconomics vs. macroeconomics.  In other words, these are just terms of convenience used by people in these fields for describing different *LEVELS OF OBSERVATION* ... the level at which we *observe* certain objects of study.   The difference between micro- and macro- is NOT that they are different phenomena that are disconnected somehow.  <br>  <br>  For example the word microgrowth refers to the kinds of *observations* we see of cells dividing in a living thing, such as a tree ... while macrogrowth refers to the *observations* of how the tree develops in its lifetime from seed to seedling to mature tree ... the structure of the branches, the fact that the tree gets taller.<br>  <br>  In exactly the same way, microevolution refers to the kinds of *observations* we see about how species change at the subspecies level ... the mechanisms of natural selection and genetic drift.    And macroevolution refers to the *observations* we see about how species *branch* into multiple species (speciation) within a genus ... how multiple genera branch into families, orders, classes, phyla, etc., the *pace* of this production of new branches, etc.<br>  <br>  So the simple definition is that microevolution concentrates on what is happening at the species level or below, and macroevolution concentrates on what is happening at the species level or above ... including the act of speciation itself.<br>  <br>  <br>  The reason this affects the debate on evolution "in society", is that anti-evolution literature (Creationist books and web sites), completely MISINTERPRET this difference between microevolution and macroevolution as *different processes in nature*, rather than just different types of *observations about nature*.    Creationists will insist that they accept that 'microevolution' occurs, but that macroevolution is "not directly observable", and in fact there is no way that microevolution could lead to macroevolution.<br>  <br>  This would be like saying that you accept that 'microgrowth' of a tree occurs (you can directly observe cells dividing under a microscope), but that macrogrowth of a tree is "not directly observable" (you can stand in front of a tree for hours and not see *ANY* macrogrowth), and in fact there is no way that microgrowth of a tree could lead to macrogrowth (no way that cells dividing could lead to the tree getting taller)!<br>  <br>  I stress that this affects the debate "in society" ... but not *in science* ... as scientists are not easily fooled by deliberate *MISUSE* of scientific terms.<br>  <br>  --- {edit} ---<br>  <br>  I should point out that my original answer started with a soapbox objection to the *PREMISE* of the question itself.   Why are biology teachers asking ridiculous questions like this!!!   Notice the bizarre construction ... it starts with the premise that there are multiple "theories", and that these are debated "in society" (not science), and then asks you to compare *scientific* definitions.   Since when do we put "scientific definitions" up for debate "in society"?  Or when does a debate "in society" become reason to reconsider their obscure terms as used *by scientists*?    Scientific definitions are used and debated *in the scientific community*, not "in society."<br>  <br>  If you are at all confused by these terms, that is *precisely the reason Creationists work so hard to get them into public usage*!    These are rather obscure terms in science, not something used every day, and even scientists use them in different ways depending on what they are talking about ... again because these terms do not convey some important division *in nature*, but are merely terms of convenience for describing a scope of study by the scientists themselves.   So if these are obscure terms that even scientists use in different ways, then why are these terms found in the debate "in society" ... i.e. in Creationist web sites, in High School biology homework, and on Yahoo Answers?  Precisely because terms like this can be easily used to confuse *non-scientists* and *kids* into thinking that there is a genuine controversy *in science* about evolution.  And there isn't ... there really isn't!   Terms adopted precisely because they  are confusing is NOT education!<br>  <br>  Sorry about my soapbox, but it is the *PREMISE* of this question that I find troubling!   It is the premise that as long as some religious groups continue to make noise "in society", that *THAT* is the reason to keep debating these topics in a science class.   Science is done *BY SCIENTISTS*, not by religious groups determined to undermine science education by (in their words) "teaching the controversy."|`|a781bc434ae321dd9513d859b0eee56baa	Macroevolution and microevolution are both studies of evolution at large and small scales respectively.  They are alike just as inches and miles -- one consists of an accumulation of the other.  There is just one theory of evolution and is can be studied in different ways.<br>  <br>  There are several scientific definitions, none in widespread usage, in different areas of study.  In cladistics, macroevolution defines a clade, a group of organisms with a common ancestor -- that is above the species level.  In anatomic fields, it refers to changes in gross morphology.  In paleontology, it refers to evolution on the geologic time scale and can refer to mass extinction events.<br>  <br>  Creationists use the term frequently, but they do not use any of these definitions.  If they claim to use the first, they redefine species as vaguely between order and family to conflate it with the second.  They will also use a variant of the third which is "more than has been observed, directly".|`|FCNAf6NTaa	There is only one theory. Micro and Macroevolution are terms used by creationists, not scientiists. <br>  <br>  Evolution is evolution.

Macroevolution is shown by Phylogenetic charts.<br>  <br>  These two terms are not really used in science much, but are sometimes used to differentiate the scale of evolution being discussed.  They are all too often used by creationists to separate the observed adaptations of organisms from the grand scale of evolution.  However, they are both, for all intensive purposes, the same, with time scale being the only real difference. To put it simply, if enough "microevolutions" happen, "macroevolution" will happen.

tU5NJVL3aa	You didn't state what approach you used to compute your values.  Here's my attempt:<br>  <br>  Break it down and work things in parts.  <br>  <br>  The base is a hexagon, so it's area is given by the formula A = s^2(3)sqrt(3)/2  <br>  A = (64)(3)sqrt(3)/2 <br>  A = 96sqrt(3) <br>  A = 166.28 square inches<br>  <br>  The upper part of the pyramid surface is going to be 6 isosceles triangles each with a base of 8 inches.  We are given that the pyramid height is sqrt(13), so we can compute the length of the sides of these triangles using the Pythagorean equation a^2 = b^2 + c^2 <br>  a^2 = 8^2 + sqrt(13)^2 <br>  a^2 = 64 + 13 = 77, so <br>  a = sqrt(77) = 8.77 inches<br>  <br>  In order to get the surface area of these triangles we'll also need the simple height of each triangle (again derived using the Pythagorean equation)<br>  a^2 = b^2 + c^2 <br>  sqrt(77)^2 = 4^2 + h^2<br>  77 - 16 = h^2<br>  h = sqrt(61) = 7.81 inches<br>  <br>  So the area of each triangle will be <br>  A = bh/2 <br>  A = 8sqrt(61)/2 = 4sqrt(61) = 31.24 square inches<br>  <br>  Putting it all together (surface of the base and the 6 triangles) to get the total pyramid surface area <br>  166.28 + 6(31.24) = 353.72 square inches.<br>  <br>  <br>  Getting the pyramid volume can also be tackled piecewise, and will be easier now that we have some of these other numbers.  <br>  <br>  The whole pyramid can be seen to consist of six equal tetrahedrons, each with equilateral triangle bases of 8 inches, a height of sqrt(13) inches, and two edges equal to sqrt(77) inches.  The formula for the volume of such a tetrahedron is given by the formula <br>  V = (1/3)(Ah)<br>  where A is the area of the base and h the height from the base to the apex.  We already have the area for the hexagon so all we have to do is divide by 6 to get the area for each base triangle  <br>  166.28/6 = 27.71 square inches.  <br>  <br>  We plug these values into the volume formula multiplied by 6 (remember there are 6 of them)<br>  6V = 6(1/3)(27.71)sqrt(13) = 199.84 cubic inches.<br>  <br>  [Note that since we originally divided by 6 and then multiplied by 6, we could also have just written the above equation as 6V = (1/3)166.28sqrt(13)]<br>  <br>  Whew!   I hope I got it right!

Starch is a very long and large molecule which cannot pass into the bloodstream of its own accord, so it must be broken down first. Enzymes bind with the starch at points called active sites where they split up the long chains in the molecule.|`|FRJoKiA0aa	Its extensive a-1-6 branching means that the molecule of starch is compact so that it does not take up much space and contains a large amount of glucose in a small area. The molecule has intramolecular hydrogen bonding in its structure so it is also insoluble which is vital as this means it will not move out of the cell by osmosis and will not have an effect on the cell's osmotic pressure. As it is a polymer, it will not be used up immediately in the cell's processes until it is hydrolysed when neccessary. The molecule is also simple enough to be quickly catalysed by enzymes.

No one else can confirm or deny it and I guess then you have to choose whether to think that you're a 100% certain that you did see grandma despite the fact that no one else could, or that you somehow imagined it or perceived the situation wrongly.<br>  <br>  So do you go with what the majority believe is true or can you trust your own eyes and brain so much that it's safe to think your own reality is right and everyone else is mistaken?

R7kk39sTaa	The water molecule is bent (angular) and contains two polar covalent bonds (two dipoles). The two dipoles create an overall molecular dipole because the molecule is bent. The H ends of the molecule are partially positive and the O end of the molecule is partially negative. The molecular dipoles cause the positive end of one water molecule to be attracted to the negative end of an adjacent molecule. The cohesive forces between the water molecules are called hydrogen bonds.|`|8BTgo4fwaa	Due to the presence of very strong hydrogen bonding between the water molecules.<br>  <br>                 or we can say<br>  <br>  Cohesion is the force of attraction between adjacent particles within the same body, the intermolecular forces holding particles of a substance together. <br>  <br>  Cohesion in water is illustrated by the surface tension caused by the inward pull on the surface molecules, and also in the transformation of a liquid into a solid state when the molecules are brought close together as happens during freezing.

Without this assumption, the weight could be anything.<br>  <br>  The centre of mass of a metre rule is at its 50cm mark.

cp1G4aDaaa	I think what you really want to find is the cube root of everything else you wrote.  The symbol you keep referring to as a square root box is called <br>  <br>  a radical<br>  <br>  When there is a small number in front of the radical, that is called the index of the radical.  When nothing is there, it is understood to be the square root.<br>  <br>  <br>  Actually, a simpler way of understanding radicals is to use rational exponents.  the cube root of a number or expression is expressed as <br>  <br>  x^(1/3) is the same as ?x<br>  <br>  <br>  The denominator of a rational exponent represents the root, the numerator is the power.  By using rational exponents instead of radicals, you can easily apply the properties of exponents.<br>  <br>  So, your problem can be expressed as:<br>  <br>  [(162 x^5 y^8)/(6 x^2 y^2)]^(1/3)<br>  <br>  Now, you have lots of common factors.  The radicand can be simplified to<br>  <br>  [27 x^3 y^6]^(1/3) = 3x y^2<br>  <br>  This is the answer.  Choice D

(work-energy: potential energy = mgh, also commonly oriented with up=positive)|`|BzsU0hJyaa	since work is the scalar multiplication of vectors, by definition Work=F*R*cos(alpha)<br>  <br>  therefore whenever a force is applied in a direction opposite to the direction of the R vector, the angle alpha will be bigger than 90 degrees and the cos funtion will make the work NEGATIVE, in your case the angle would be 0 since both mg and R are straight down. <br>  <br>  the gravitational energy could decrease, depending on your point of reference, which is your choice entirely, but the kinetic energy increases. the work of the conserving force mg increased the kinetic energy.

You could also test for serial independence of the 13 values one from another.<br>  <br>  If these tests are satisfactory you may construct Confidence Intervals - use the mean and estimated population S.D. of the data set with a table of t-values for d.f. = 12.<br>  <br>  Finally you could look at the correlation between the plasma set and the serum set - then derive a Type 2 regression equation to allow estimation of one from the other if the correlation coefficient turns out to be close to unity.<br>  <br>  If either of the sets fails the test of normality, you must use a non-parametric method for finding a regression line.

"Negative energy" is a myth. There is actually no such thing, at least that anyone can show. Energy has a precise definition in physics and engineering, but in the paranormal it is a meaningless word.  Perhaps you mean that you feel down, anxious, afraid, tired, or perhaps a similar feeling. A good cure is two-fold: start feeling better about yourself by getting exercise and staying in shape, and also make an effort to better yourself or to help others. Both of these things will help to raise your spirits, so to speak. Unfortunately, real life problems require effort and determination to solve.

Bulk modulus is like Young's modulus, only that it links change in volume to change in pressure.<br>  <br>  So, iron's volume will decrease *slightly*, while it's mass is constant (unless there were some iron-eating bacteria on the bottom of that lake!).<br>  <br>  Thus, B) is the correct answer.

Individual members of wild species held tame in captivity are still considered "wildlife" as they are not genetically different from those remaining in a wild state. Wildlife conservation and management is the protection and use of wild-animal populations and of the land necessary to support them to ensure that productivity and ecological balance are maintained in perpetuity, while social benefits are realized. Human activity has become one of the most significant influences on the abundance and well-being of wildlife.

stAeoUeSaa	If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a>|`|1505a95e660275609c4bb43c388cdf1aaa	The universe began with the big bang and expanded from there.

Therefore, his make corresponds to the “dark matter” or material of darkness out of which he produced himself to become mathematically the number one and woman is the Key to kindom of Heaven or Advance Civilization<br>  <br>  GOD formed Himself--not from a mother, but out of the dark womb of space and  before there was Sun, there was a Woman.

VLT2VgP9aa	To prove that an ideal is maximal, you want to show that the only ideal that properly contains it is the whole ring.  Suppose A is properly contained in B, an ideal of Z * Z.  Then there exists an element of B which is not in A.  By examination of A, we know that this element must be of the form (3n + 1, y) or (3n + 2, y).<br>  <br>  Since the remainder of this proof will only be concerned with the first part of each ordered pair, I won't bother to write out the whole thing.  So, if I say 3n is an element of A, what I really mean is (3n, y) is an element of A.  This is just for convenience, so don't let it confuse you.<br>  <br>  Suppose there is an integer n such that 3n + 1 is in B.  Since B contains A, it contains all elements of the form 3m.  By closure of addition, it must contain all elements of the form <br>  <br>  3m + 3n + 1 = 3(m+n) + 1<br>  <br>  Since m+n can be any integer, B contains all integers of the form 3a + 1.  Furthermore, since B is an ideal, it contains all elements of the form<br>  <br>  (3r + 2)(3n + 1) = 3(3rn + r + 2n) + 2<br>  <br>  Since 3rn + r + 2n can be any integer, B contains all elements of the form 3b + 2.  Thus, since B contains all elements of the form 3n, 3n+1, and 3n+2, it is equal to Z * Z.<br>  <br>  Now, assume B contains an element of the form 3n + 2 and follow similar steps to arrive at the same conclusion.
VLT2VgP9aa	You just need to apply the ideal test here.  If r is in N(A), then r^n is in A for some positive integer n.  Let a be an element of R and consider the element ar.  (ar)^n = (a^n)(r^n), which follows from the commutativity of R.  Since r^n is in A and A is an ideal, (a^n)(r^n) is in A, so ar is in N(A).  Also, since R is commutative, ar = ra, so ra is also in N(A).<br>  <br>  All that's left to show is closure under subtraction.  Let r and s be in N(A), and suppose m and n are integers such that r^m and s^n are both in A.  Consider (r - s)^(m+n).  If you expand this using the binomial theorem (which I'll leave to you) you'll see that each term has a factor of r^m or s^n, which is enough to show that each term is in A (again, because A is an ideal).  Thus, (r - s)^(m+n) is in A, so r - s is in N(A).<br>  <br>  Therefore, N(A) is an ideal of R.

468c5dee5c181b1798b24ccd745a3804aa	the first 2 answers above are correct but don't really answer the question.<br>  <br>  what you are asking about is a so-called "weak decay" process, i.e. this process occurs because of the exchange of a W boson. <br>  <br>  basically a down quark (in a neutron) converts into an up quark and a W- (which conserves charge of course). this W- is very heavy and is thus very short-lived (see Heisenberg uncertainty). the W- decays into a an electron and an antineutrino. <br>  <br>  so the process is n ->  p + W-  -> p + e- + anti-nu_e.<br>  <br>  it is not that the neutron contains a p and a e as constituents, but that the weak force is in play. as the neutron mass exceeds that of the proton, this decay process is energetically allowed. <br>  <br>  there are a number of related processes also governed by the weak interaction. these are positron emission and electron capture (as well as bouble-beta decay, but which is a lot rarer)<br>  <br>  cheers|`|sKXzYvaRaa	Well, your science teacher is right.  A neutron is made of three quarks (two down -1/3 quarks and one up +2/3 quark).  Notice the -1/3 + -1/3 + 2/3 = 0 ->  This is why a neutron has no electrical charge.  A proton is made of the same quarks in different proportions (one -1/3 and two +2/3 quarks).  Here -1/3 + 2/3 + 2/3 = 1 so this is where the protons charge comes from.<br>  <br>  To go further is beyond the scope of something I could easily write up and is pushing my understanding of quantum mechanics to begin with.  There are several websites that will give you the details though... just search for "neutron beta decay".|`|8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	The best way to explain this in simple words, is that neutrons, protons and electrons consist of even smaller particles, called quarks. These quarks come in different types and with different electric charges. Different arrangements of various quarks make up the neutrons, protons and electrons.<br>  <br>  The neutron consists of two down quarks with charge -1/3 and one up quark with charge +2/3, and the decay of one of the down quarks into a lighter up quark can be achieved by the emission of a W boson. By this means the neutron decays into a proton (which contains one down and two up quarks), an electron, and an antineutrino.|`|EOqxenK9aa	Well, the deal is that you've ignored quarks, and ignored how that decay really works. A beta- decay releases an electron and an antineutrino.<br>  <br>  A neutron is made up of quarks. In beta- decay, a down quark converts to an up quark and W- boson is emitted. The W- boson then decays into an electron and an antineutrino.
8bac1627976c8fad956d758dcd324aa7aa	A dimension is just a word for something you can measure. In theory of Relativity, space is represented as spacetime continuum - with three dimensions of space and one dimension of time. Hence, people call time the 4th dimension, even though it's not a dimension of space. It's a dimension in its own right.<br>  <br>  The 4th dimension of space would be in direction perpendicular to the three familiar directions (up-down, left-right, forwards-backwards), but it's impossible to draw or even imagine such direction. We're hopelessly "trapped" in 3-dimensional space and can only theorise about the 4th dimension using mathematical models and funky drawings.<br>  <br>  The possibility that there might be more than one dimension of time has occasionally been discussed in physics and philosophy. Theories with more than one dimension of time have sometimes been advanced in physics, whether as a serious description of reality or just as a curious possibility.|`|e55d4a01420a2827c4108baf10b7d77daa	Acceleration is increasing your speed across a plane on one of the three dimensions, so no. You're confusing laws of physics with geometry. And the fourth dimension is only time in a sense. It's not literally the travel through time as we think of it, but it's a fourth spatial dimension that transcends time, because everything is ever expanding. To travel through time would mean to compress the spaces between molecules and the particles within the atoms. Because the universe is ever expanding, to compress that would go back in time to a less expanded phase. A four dimensional object traveling through our three dimensions would look like a morphing object. Look up hypercube, and it'll give you a little bit of an idea of how the fourth dimension works. So the fourth dimension is time, but in a spatial sense.<br>  <br>  The fifth dimension on the other hand, is a musical group from the 60s. And a pretty good one, too.|`|luYtFLSUaa	Acceleration is a phenomenon that occurs in space and time and is caused by a force.

NIyyDwNVaa	Hardy Weinber Equilibrium is given by the equation p^2 + 2*p*q + q^2 where p and q are the allele frequencies<br>  <br>  p^2 is the frequency of the homozygous in the population<br>  <br>  2pq is the frequency of heterozygous in the populationi<br>  <br>  You know that the total amount of flowers in you're population is 84% meaning the total homozygous and heterozygous = 84%<br>  <br>  p^2 + 2pq = .84<br>  <br>  you know that white flowers will be 100% - 84% = 16% because there are only two types of flowers red and white. So if 84% are red then 16% has to be white<br>  <br>  white flowers are always homozygous recessive because the only way a recessive allele will express is if there is no dominant allele<br>  <br>  If I gave the letter R to represent homozygous dominant allele.<br>  <br>  RR and Rr = Red flowers<br>  <br>  rr = White flowers<br>  <br>  If q = white flower which equals = r<br>  <br>  q^2 = frequency of white flowers = .16<br>  <br>  Therefore solve for q = .4<br>  <br>  If q = .4 then p has to equal .6<br>  <br>  Why? Because there are only two alleles they have to add to a frequency of 1.<br>  <br>  Therefore the frequency of the red allele is 60%<br>  <br>  Check you're work<br>  <br>  We know that p^2 + 2*p*q = .84<br>  <br>  .6^2 + 2*.6*.4 = .36+.48 = .84 And that means we got the right answer<br>  <br>  Why is 2*p*q = heterozygous<br>  <br>  because P = R and q = r. And in a cross of two flowers Red Homozygous and White (Homozygous) Flowers<br>  <br>  You will end up with a 1:2:1 genotypic ratio where RR: Rr: rr<br>  <br>  2 = Rr<br>  That's why 2*p*q = heterozygous.

Then for constant acceleration motion, you know that v = a * t. Convert 68km/h to SI units (m/s), that's your v (velocity).

Then convert t (time) from SI units (s - seconds) to min (minutes).<br>  <br>  Google will do unit conversions for you. Just type 68 km/h to m/s into Google, for example.

jeMNcPPYaa	The carbon (and dust in the form of soot) in the air forms a blanket. Moisture can cling to the dust, so there is more water in the layer around us. <br>  <br>  This is like a mirror from space, the sun's energy is reflected away, so less energy is getting through. But at the same time the blanket from our side retains heat.<br>  <br>  So although we seem to have been heading towards warmer times anyway (the very end of an ice age) it has happened too quickly. The earth is very good at repairing itself given time and resources.<br>  <br>  The question is, are we allowing and helping the earth and nature to adjust. It seems that we are not able or willing to do this. Animals and insects should have moved according to climate, but this is not allowed to happen. Borders and fences are static. <br>  <br>  For example Eagle Owls returned to the UK for the first time in at least a couple of hundred years, but it was decided they were not local protected species, therefore it was legal to shoot them therefore they did just that.<br>  <br>  Bears should also have moved, but they couldn't, go too far south and they are targets for hunters. So instead they die because the ice that holds their food is not there any more.<br>  <br>  So yes we are responsible both for global warming and for the fact that the earth will not be able to repair itself.|`|tqQIcLb5aa	Taking large quantities of materials (oil, gas, coal etc...) and converting them into heat energy + hazardous gases can't be very good for the world.|`|GfG6wupTaa	No it is not.

t5Nrj6Txaa	33GeV is an energy.  Do you mean a momentum of 33GeV/c or is 33GeV the total energy?  Depending on the answer to this question, it would likely be easiest to use the expression:<br>  <br>  E^2 = (mc^2) + (pc)^2<br>  <br>  Since mc^2 ~ .5MeV for an electron, this means E ~ pc when energy or momentum are in the GeV range.  This means, if I had to guess, that 33GeV is the kinetic energy you are looking for.

SvmZlLdaaa	The dominant male and female, known as the alpha pair, are the only wolves in a pack to breed, and they usually mate for life. They breed once a year, mating in late winter. Like all canids, the male and female become locked together during mating in a coital tie - the base of the male's penis, called the knot, swells inside the vagina and becomes lodged for around 30 minutes. They will mate several times a day throughout the female's receptive period.<br>  <br>  After a gestation of around 63 days, between two and eight young (usually 3 to 6) are born in an underground den. The young are called cubs or pups. All members of the pack bring food to the mother whilst the cubs are in the den, and will regurgitate partially-digested food for them once they are able to eat solids. Some will stay with the pack all their lives, others will leave after their second winter, when they are fully grown and sexually mature, to join other packs or start new ones of their own.<br>  <br>  Here is an image of wolves mating:<br>  <a href="http://www.animalpicturesarchive.com/ArchOLD-1/1096716023.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.animalpicturesarchive.com/Arc...</a><br>  <br>  I don't have a picture of a wolf's vagina, but it is basically identical to a dog's (dogs are descended from wolves).

EOqxenK9aa	Back to earth from where? An earth orbit? A 100 pound capsule, at some Earth orbit way above the atmosphere, needs to get its orbital energy low enough that the resulting orbit is subject to atmospheric drag.<br>  <br>  So you need following:<br>  0. Starting orbital height.<br>  1. Equation for orbital velocity vs. orbit height.<br>  2. A choice of some height h at which the atmospheric drag is "high enough".<br>  <br>  From 0 and 1 you get initial orbital velocity. From 1 and 2 you get braking orbital velocity at an orbit that will result in the capsule aerobraking (braking due to air friction) and falling down to Earth's surface.<br>  <br>  Then you get Delta_v = initial orbital velocity - braking orbital velocity. Delta_v is the change in orbital speed that you need to get.<br>  <br>  You get this change in orbital speed by changing the momentum of the capsule. The change in momentum is Delta_v * capsule mass, and is simply the impulse developed by a rocket motor.<br>  <br>  You have to understand that an orbit height in a circular orbit is linked to orbital velocity. Now of course you need two engine firings to change one circular orbit into another, but you don't really care all that much about the lower orbit being elliptical: as long as it's low enough, the aerobraking will be fast enough that you won't bounce back into space. Getting this just right is important, but I doubt the problem wants you to deal with thermal loads experienced by the capsule.<br>  <br>  What else do you need? You should be able to find the equations yourself. They are all on wikipedia. Learn to use it, it's a valuable resource, and it usually gets basic physics right :)
buLqy1b3aa	There are two ways of looking at it.<br>  <br>  The easiest way is that we know the solution to a SHM equation takes the following form:<br>  x = x0 + Acos(wt+phi)<br>  <br>  So that means you just have to use the information in the problem to solve for the parameters x0, A, and phi.<br>  <br>  The other way of looking at it, is that you are solving a differential equation.  I believe it is x'' = -kx.  In a homogeneous differential equation, such as this one, the solution is of the form Ae^(jwt).  Plugging this expression in for x should easily lead to the sinusoidal expression above.  You can then use the initial conditions to solve for the function specific to your problem.

IkIRY71Gaa	It's 10P5. This is a permutation because there are 10P5 ways to inspect 10 tape recorders.<br>  The answer to the problem is to look at the probability of a favorable outcome on each pick. You have 5 picks, and you want 5 of the 7 good ones out of the 10. This means that with each pick, your probability will go down with the next one. Find each pick as below:<br>  1: 7/10<br>  2: 6/9<br>  3: 5/8<br>  4: 4/7<br>  5: 3/6<br>  Then multiply each, since you must find the first and the second, and the third...etc. The answer will be 2520/30240, or 1/12<br>  <br>  Or, if you wanted to just shortcut the whole thing, the probability would be 7P5 / 10P5, since you're trying to find a way to pick 5 of 7 out of all the ways to pick 5 of 10.

The fur consists of a layer of dense, but soft, WHITE underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. (Please see source link.

In the polar region, half the year it is dark as night almost all day long.

Repeat, ALL visible light, it doesn't need a lot. The transparent hollow hairs reflect  the undercoat (white), not the snow, although the snow does make them appear more white than the yellowish or tan tinge when they are on land which is without snow.<br>  <br>  In addition to their fur, the blubber underneath their skin is the main reason they can withstand the frigid temps.

IkIRY71Gaa	Since it's compounding, it'd be:<br>  800*1.05*1.05*1.05 - 800<br>  This means that you're taking your initial principle, the ￡800, then finding 105% of it, since you're adding 5%, then adding another 5% on top of that, then another 5%. Finally, you only want the interest, so you subtract out what the original principle was, since that's not part of your interest.

EOqxenK9aa	When we deal with things that fall and want to know how long they stay in the air, we only care about the vertical component of things. About the only time that the horizontal component would come into play is if the projectile were to land on a surface that's not horizontal and/or not flat (say an incline or a staircase).<br>  <br>  So, since we only take vertical component of position, speed and acceleration, the displacement is in vertical direction. The arrow starts at the castle wall and ends up at the ground that's 10m lower.<br>  <br>  Now of course the arrow will first move up, and only then start coming down. So if you'd plot y(t) (y as a function of time), it first goes positive (the arrow was shot *above* the horizontal), then it stops, and then goes down, passes through zero, and goes negative down to -10m. The arrow ends up lower than it started with, thus -10m.

AA10929714	The behavior of a damped harmonic oscillator is is described by the differential equation:<br>  <br>  x'' + k*x' + (w^2)*x = 0<br>  <br>  where k is the damping coefficient and w is the natural angular frequency of the corresponding undamped system.  Because you did not provide units in your differential equation, I will assume that the values of k and w in your equation have compatible units for time, mass, and distance. <br>  <br>  For an underdamped oscillator, that is, one for which k^2 < 4*w^2, the angular frequency of oscillation is given by:<br>  <br>  W = sqrt[w^2 - (k/2)^2]<br>  <br>  Note that when k = 0 the angular frequency reduces to that of the undamped case, as expected.<br>  <br>  In this case, k= 0.2 and w = 6, so 4*w^2 = 144 > 0.2^2 = 0.04, so this is an underdamped oscillator.  The angular frequency of oscillation is:<br>  <br>  W = sqrt(36 - (0.2/2)^2) = 5.999.<br>  <br>  The angular frequency and period(T)  of an oscillator are related by:<br>  <br>  T = 2*pi/w<br>  <br>  The behavior of a damped oscillator is not strictly periodic (the amplitude of oscillation decays with time), but if we ignore this, then the period of oscillation of this damped oscillator is:<br>  <br>  T = 2*pi/W = 1.047 (in whatever units of time that w and k were given in).

koAaPXKQaa	In Britain, even if a person has an organ donor card and has registered themself, if they die, the family can override this decision (or atleast that used ot be the case.)<br>  <br>  The law needs to be changed so that this doesn't happen. Organ donorship also needs more publicity, as it is still seen as taboo to some people and is not fully understood. Too many people sit on the fence with this decision and it often doesn't take much to convince people that this is a wonderful thing to do. <br>  <br>  The public require more education on organ donation.|`|0vQsoYIbaa	Here is how to make enough donor organs available:<br>  <br>  Establish the National Organ Donor Lottery.  You sign up to donate organs.  Each year, the people who died and donated organs are entered in a multi-million dollar lottery where their heirs and beneficiaries get the money.  The odds of winning some amount could be made to be very favorable. Suicides are obviously excluded. <br>  <br>  Everybody wins.  If you die, you go to heaven for doing good things.  Your heirs obviously win.   And the donees obviously win.  A couple of billionaires could sponsor this lottery and save thousands of lives.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	A number of scandals around contaminated blood and organs have given rise to fears about organ donation. Also, a huge number of urban legends exist around organ harvesting (none of these are true, by the way; organs cannot be removed like that). One of the main reasons is that people forget to fill in donor cards, or that their next-of-kin are not notified about their wish. Also, people see it as a strange way to be buried or cremated, when they're not "whole".<br>  <br>  One way to reduce the shortage is to reverse the way the card works: people should fill in a card when they refuse to be a donor. It would be the easiest way, and it is equally fair; right now, people don't go to the bother of filling in a card while organs are necessary.|`|9Cwc4voKaa	in the UK there are not enough organ donors because you have to sign up to be an organ donor (opt in) and so if you don't do this, your organs can't be used. However in other countries if you don't want to be an organ donor you have to opt out (your automatically a donor) so in these countries you organs can automatically be used.|`|4c1e07d9ba0c2d099d9db46ee34af35faa	Another reason that there is a shortage of organ donors is that fewer people die in traffic accidents than they used to - the main source of donated organs. <br>  <br>  In the future we will have to hope that traffic accidents continue to fall, but that alternatives to organ transplantation become available, possibly based on stem cell therapy and nanotechnology.|`|1305765249b53f290c467decdedb9e3aaa	because people with organs usually want to keep them <br>  part 2 stem cells can perhaps be used to grow new organs in the future and used on people who need them!|`|64966f431eb7c4148256720cef5f2654aa	The primary reason is that not everyone who dies can be an organ donor.  That's a misconception people have, which I think sometimes makes people think it's okay if they don't register to become a donor because everyone else can do it.<br>  <br>  It's not so.  Only about 1% to 3% of the population dies in such a way that they can become a donor, add to this people who don't tell their families that they would like to be a donor, or people who have fears about donation and won't allow their family member to become a donor when the decision is left to them to make at such a difficult time, and you get dwindling numbers.<br>  <br>  I recently learned that another reason why it takes so long for the transplant waiting list to go down has to do with insurance companies.  Many times they will only allow organs which doctors guarantee a 93% or 99% success rate with.  So, doctors are told to reject orgrans that could give even an 89% or 91% success rate, and many recovered organs are not used.<br>  <br>  What do you think is the solution?|`|AqFowCfuaa	there arent enough donor organs because not enough people conveniently die at the right time. <br>  <br>  solution : kill more people.|`|yj32G1cuaa	I had to answer this before,<br>  <br>  one think which my teacher said to mention is cloning as well

Godbless|`|tsNMMLMUaa	Well, if we helped you, then you wouldn't be teaching yourself.|`|VLT2VgP9aa	Ideally, you'll want actual textbooks, as they will be more complete than pretty much anything you'll find on the web.  However, wikibooks.org is a great resource, so you should check there.<br>  <br>  Also, if you have the money, it might be worthwhile to invest in professional tutoring/instruction.  I am an instructor at a tutoring center that specializes in math, and we had a case similar to yours.  A guy graduated from high school, then went straight into the military.  Four years later, he comes home and decides he wants to enroll at the local college.  But, he had forgotten almost all the math he had learned.  So, we started him on our own curriculum all the way back at fifth grade stuff.  He powered all the way through middle school math over the course of a couple months, and last I checked, he's making his way through Algebra 1 material.<br>  <br>  If you have the money, that is probably the most efficient way to go.  That way, you'll have professionals helping you work at the pace you want to work at and answer the questions you are guaranteed to have.  But whatever you do, don't hire a private tutor.  They are way more expensive, and they tend to hang over you all the time, which can actually slow you down if you are normally a fast-paced learner.

There is no purpose.<br>  <br>  Tjhere have been good programes on TV about the birth of the earth. showing the still almost molten proto earth colliding with a smaller planetoid, leaving both smashed in pieces, which then gathered together and reformed as gravity pulled floating debris together.  Apparently this means that the moon has a hight proportion of lighter elements that the earth now has, which is useful for us as the heavy iron at the core gives us our protective magnetic envelope.  <br>  <br>   The moon, now moving almost imperceptibly away from the earth, pulls at the sea so giving tides and causing sea and air currents to flow and create weather systems, so we do not have one place that gets boiling hot all year and one place that gets freezing cold all the time.

gReXjl6Kaa	boiling point of alcohol is lower than water (78 Celsius) because it's vapor pressure is higher than water so when alcohol dissolves in water increases the vapor pressure of the mixture (solution), therefore the boiling point of the solution decreases.<br>  <br>  When a solute is added to a solvent, the vapor pressure of the solvent (above the resulting solution) is lower than the vapor pressure above the pure solvent. So because of this decrease in vapor pressure the energy which is needed to boil water is higher than of pure water, then the boiling point (boiling temperature) will get higher.

4283c6ea8e856476bcccc6289e6452adaa	I've read the other answers and I'm sorry, but friction is not the root cause of static electricity.  It can contribute to it, but does not actually cause it.  In certain circumstances among certain materials, static electricity can be created without having the materials come in actual contact with each other at all.  In reality, static electricity is caused by a build up of charges in one material and a lacking of that charge in another material.  If a material of some kind has an abundance of electrons it becomes charged which is unstable if you will.  Meanwhile another material is lacking an electron(s) of that charge which gives it the opposite charge.  Once those two materials come in close contact, but not actually touching each other (hence no friction) the electron(s) from the one material will jump to the other material and each one will then become neutrally charged (as in no charge).  Most people associate friction with static electricity because when certain objects are rubbed against something else, they tend to lose their electrons to that other object and become charged.  Once they are in the remote vacinity of an oppositely charged object, the electrons jump back.  In many cases, there are so few electrons in the transmission that we can feel it, but can't see them with the naked eye.  However, I'm sure you've actually seen flashes before where the electrons jumped through mid air from one object to another and caused a spark of light as they did so.  And, of course, the best show in nature of static electricity at it's best is during a lightning storm.  The ground is charged differently than the clouds and in fact clouds can be charged oppositely from each other.  That's why you have lightning from cloud to cloud (which is actually the most common since the gaps are less) and cloud to ground (it takes a higher build up of stored energy to jump the much longer gap).  Also of note, the common atmosphere is an insulator while water is a conductor.  Interesting, isn't it?<br>  <br>  Ed|`|TWsxP46Qaa	friction between a manmade fabric and a 100% natural fabric,ie nylon and wool etc<br>  <br>  its to do with transfer of electrons if memory serves well|`|1SNSidJ0aa	by friction and the electrons switch atoms thats why you get shocked|`|RTgMgT6baa	friction|`|BgZCETPZaa	It doesn't generate itself|`|Fi0XZ9Zeaa	friction
AA11432707	Try something other than medical school.

cWuumdy7aa	Benzoyl peroxide  is a chemical in the organic peroxide family. It consists of two benzoyl groups (benzoic acid with the H of carboxylic acid removed) joined by a peroxide group. Acceptable condensed structural formulae would include C6H5-COO-OOC-C6H5, PhCO-O-O-COPh, and (PhCO)2O2. It is often abbreviated Bz2O2.<br>  <br>  Benzoyl peroxide is used as a radical initiator. Homolytic cleavage of the weak oxygen-oxygen bond forms benzoyl free radicals which trigger further reactions.<br>  <br>  Jack Breitbart of Revlon laboratories first developed benzoyl peroxide's use for treating acne in the 1920s. It is typically placed over the affected areas in gel or cream form, in concentrations of 2.5% increasing through the usually effective 5% to up to 10%. Research suggests that 5 and 10% concentrations are not significantly more effective than 2.5% and 2.5% is usually better tolerated It commonly causes initial dryness and sometimes irritation, although skin tolerance usually occurs after a week or so. A small percentage of people are much more sensitive to it and liable to suffer burning, itching, peeling and possibly swelling. It is sensible to apply the lowest concentration and build up as appropriate. Once tolerance is achieved, increasing the quantity or concentration a second time and gaining tolerance at a higher level usually gives better subsequent acne clearance. Benzoyl peroxide works as a peeling agent, increasing skin turnover and clearing pores, thus reducing the bacterial count there as well as directly as an antibacterial.<br>  <br>  Other common uses for benzoyl peroxide include dying hair, and as an active ingredient in teeth whitening systems. It is also used in the preparation of flour, and can be used as an initiator and catalyst for polyester thermoset resins (as an alternative to the much more hazardous methyl ethyl ketone peroxide).

b1a356a171cfdc067007281982717464aa	They have a genetic condition called color blindness.<br>  <br>  In our eyes, we have two types of cells: rods, and cones.  Rods detect light (and are the cells that do all the work when it's dark out - that's why when it's truly dark, the world looks mainly like it's black, white, and shades of grey).<br>  <br>  Cones detect color, and don't work in very low light.  They do this by having inside them several different proteins that react under certain colors of light.<br>  <br>  People who are colorblind lack some of those proteins.|`|cWuumdy7aa	Color blindness, a color vision deficiency, is the inability to perceive differences between some of the colors that others can distinguish. It is most often of genetic nature, but may also occur because of eye, nerve, or brain damage, or due to exposure to certain chemicals. The English chemist John Dalton published the first scientific paper on the subject in 1798, "Extraordinary facts relating to the vision of colours",after the realization of his own color blindness; because of Dalton's work, the condition is sometimes called Daltonism, although this term is now used for a type of color blindness called deuteranopia.<br>  <br>  Color blindness is usually classed as disability; in certain situations, however, color blind people have an advantage over people with normal color vision. There are some studies which conclude that color blind individuals are better at penetrating certain camouflages<br>  Any recessive genetic characteristic that persists at a level as high as 5% is generally regarded as possibly having some advantage over the long term.[dubious – discuss] In World War II it was discovered that analysis of color aerial photos yielded more information if at least one team member was color blind.[citation needed] Significantly[citation needed], humans are the only trichromatic primates with such a high percentage of color blindness.<br>  <br>  Another possible advantage might result from the presence of a tetrachromic female. Owing to X-chromosome inactivation, women who are heterozygous for anomalous trichromacy ought to have at least four types of cone in their retinae. It is possible that this affords them an extra dimension of color vision, by analogy to New World monkeys where heterozygous females gain trichromacy in a basically dichromatic species.<br>  [ Genetic modes of inheritance<br>  Color blindness can be inherited genetically. Some people believe, incorrectly, that it is only ever inherited from mutations on the X chromosome but the mapping of the human genome has shown there are many causative mutations--mutations capable of causing color blindness originate from at least 19 different chromosomes and many different genes (as shown online at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) database at Johns Hopkins University). Cone dystrophy, Cone-rod dystrophy, Achromatopsia (aka Rod Monochromatism, aka Stationery Cone Dystrophy, aka Cone Dysfunction Syndrome), Blue cone monochromatism, Retinitis pigmentosa (initially affects rods but can later progress to cones and therefore color blindness), Diabetes, Age-Related Macular degeneration, Retinoblastoma, Leber's congenital amaurosis - These are some of the inherited diseases known to cause color blindness.<br>  <br>  Inherited color blindness can be congenital (from birth), or it can commence in childhood or adulthood. Depending on the mutation, it can be stationary, that is, remain the same throughout a person's lifetime, or progressive. As progressive phenotypes involve deterioration of the retina and other parts of the eye, certain forms of color blindness can progress to legal blindness, i.e., an acuity of 6/60 or worse, and often leave a person with complete blindness.<br>  <br>  Color blindness always pertains to the cone photoreceptors in our retina as the cones are capable of detecting the color frequencies of light we perceive.<br>  <br>  About 5—8 percent of males, but less than 1 percent of females, are color blind in some way or another, whether it be one color, a color combination, or another mutation.The reason males are at a greater risk of inheriting an X linked mutation is because males only have one X chromosome (XY, with the Y chromosome being significantly shorter than the X chromosome), and females have two (XX); if the women inherit a normal X chromosome in addition to the one which carries the mutation, they will not display the mutation, while men have no 'spare' normal chromosome to override the chromosome which carries the mutation. If 5% of variants of a given gene are defective, the probability of a single copy being defective is 5%, but the probability that two copies are both defective is 0.05 × 0.05 = 0.0025, or just 0.25%.<br>  <br>  <br>  [Other causes<br>  Shaken Baby Syndrome (this can cause retina and brain damage and therefore cause color blindness), accidents and other trauma (swelling of the brain in the occipital lobe), and UV damage to the retina (from not wearing appropriate protection). Most UV damage is caused during childhood and this form of retinal degeneration is the leading cause of blindness in the world. Damage often presents itself later on in life.|`|EOqxenK9aa	We have color-sensitive light receptors in the retinas of our eyes. Those receptors are called cones. There are three types of cones, each one sensitive more to a particular color more than the others. While all of those receptors are sensitive to all visible colors to some extent, the fact that each group is *most* sensitive to a different color enables us to distinguish different colors.<br>  <br>  The color sensitivity is caused by pigments in the cones. Some cone types may be damaged because the pigment didn't properly develop, for example.|`|z0GqpcvPaa	selective color blindness

If the Earth were to stop revolving around the sun, the centripetal force would be lost and the gravitational pull between the sun and the Earth would "suck" the earth into the sun at ever increasing speed.|`|TuGkVqwraa	One part of the earth live in dark forever.<br>  Time will stop forever.|`|ksOW8Y4Aaa	It's a little unclear what you are asking.

The way to find the perpendicular distance that this chord is from the center of the circle is from the chord is to draw the perpendicular radius to the chord . Let the distance between the chord and the center be x. Now draw the radii to the endpoints of the chord. Now from this relationship, we can use the pythagorean theorem to solve for the length of the perpendicular distance. x^2 + (.5 * Length of the chord)^2 = (3 sqrt 2)^2, or x^2 = 18 - 16 = 2, or x = sqrt 2. Therefore, this chord is a distance of the square root of 2 units from the center of the circle.<br>  <br>  d.) In order to find the x coordinate of intersection of any point between this line and the circle, we must substitute this equation into the equation for the circle:<br>  <br>  x^2 - 4x + (2k - x)^2 - 14 = 0<br>  x^2 - 4x + 4k^2 - 4kx + x^2 - 14 =0<br>  2x^2- 4(k +1)x + 4k^2 -14 = 0<br>  x^2-2(k +1)x + 2k^2 - 7 = 0, which was to be shown.<br>  <br>  e.)

Since these are all points where the lines intersect the circle and they are all equal roots, then these points must be tangents to the circle at all points k.

The pictures, gradually played back to Earth from a small tape recorder on the probe, showed lunar-type impact craters.<br>  <br>  The Marsnik program, was the first Soviet unmanned spacecraft interplanetary exploration program, which consisted of two flyby probes launched towards Mars in October 1960, Marsnik 1 and 2 dubbed Mars 1960A and Mars 1960B (also known as Korabl 4 and Korabl 5 respectively). After launch, the third stage pumps on both Marsnik launchers were unable to develop enough thrust to commence ignition, so Earth parking orbit was not achieved.

Sixty-one radio transmissions were held, initially at two day intervals and later at 5 days in which a large amount of interplanetary data was collected. On 21 March 1963, when the spacecraft was at a distance of 106,760,000 km from Earth, on its way to Mars, communications ceased, due to failure of the spacecraft's antenna orientation system.<br>  <br>  In 1964, both Soviet probe launches, of Zond 1964A on June 4, and Zond 2 on November 30, (part of the Zond program), resulted in failures.

Try 12.  12*12 is 144 so that is it.

HvnxG0V8aa	To break apart the bonds in NH4NO3 in water energy is needed, that's why it's absorbed. Then by the surrounding of the ions by water some energy is released. Depending on whether the energy released or the energy absorbed is greater determines whether the reaction is endothermic or exothermic. In this case more energy is absorbed so it's endothermic.

You crack them open and you will find everything in them that you will find out here. Then were there some of them (atoms) out here? Well, who created them? WE say, "There is no beginning or ending." I admit that.  But we do know that they had to have some kind of beginning. But how it happened, we don't know.

zHmZkMStaa	I vaguely recall a documentary where they showed that logging can be eco-friendly if done selectively (choosing mature trees just prior to their natural decline, clearing the way for fresh growth, etc..)

KHeR3hGIaa	Hard to be certain without a circuit diagram what we're dealing with (but you said lights and switches, and I assume a battery), but batteries are not perfect -- they have an internal resistance to them.  You can think of it as a resistor in series with the battery itself.<br>  <br>  When you increase the load on the battery, this reduces the voltage seen coming out of the battery.  In the extreme case of a short circuit, the voltage seen drops to almost zero (not exactly zero, because the short circuit itself can't have zero resistance.)<br>  <br>  And even if the power source isn't a battery but is instead a transformer or something else, the wires involved have a non-zero resistance, and so they'll produce the same effect -- the higher the current draw, the lower the voltage you'll measure from the power source.<br>  <br>  Now, this all assumes that you're measure the voltage at the power source.  If you're measuring it somewhere else, different factors might come into effect.  But this is a pretty good guess at what you're seeing without knowing the details of your circuit.|`|lQao8Wt0aa	If the voltage source was a batttery, the battery might be weak, or the load of the bulbs is high - low resistance.  A weak battery has a higher internal resistance than a fresh one.  If the source is a power supply, it's probably not regulated, or the load of the lights is heavy.|`|buLqy1b3aa	It depends on where you were measuring the voltage.<br>  <br>  My guess is that you were measuring the voltage across one of the transistors.  If the switch (transistor) is off, then there is infinite resistance across it's channel, so all the supply voltage appears across the channel of the transistor.  When you switch it on, then the channel has very little resistance (so that current can pass and drive the light bulb).  In this case, the voltage across the transistor should be very low.|`|pWxhivTIaa	The 4 volts you were reading is called Open Circuit Voltage (OCV), that is the voltage when no current is being drawn.<br>  <br>  Once a significant amount of current is being drawn, the voltage in a battery will drop (it depends on the type of battery, on how much and for how long the drop will be - i.e. a NiCad will drop very little from it's 1.25 volt OCV, and will stay at that voltage for a long time under nominal current draw. A 'carbon zinc' battery will drop more from it's OCV (also called rest voltage), and after a short while will continue to decline) <br>  <br>  The only way to prevent a drop in voltage is to use a regulator circuit.<br>  <br>  As a general rule, Deep Cycle (rechargeable) batteries will keep their voltage at a more stable voltage for a longer time period than non-rechargeables.

7lKJfwEdaa	The decibel is indeed a logarithmic unit of measurement. It is used in many areas of science and engineering. It is used to determine the gain of a sound or electrical current. A decibel is 1/10th of a Bel, which was named after Alexander Graham Bell. The Bel is too big of a measurement to measure small changes, so it is common to use the decibel, or dB.<br>  When using the dB it needs to be accompanied by a reference of what you are comparing it to or it is useless. <br>  <br>  The easy thing to remember about the dB is that a 2X increase in a sound or electrical network is equal to 3dB -- 10dB = 10X; 20dB = 100X; and 30dB = 1000X increase in signal strength or sound pressure level.<br>  <br>  As a HAM radio operator I deal with the dB daily, as well as being a musician/audiophile. The signal strength meters on communications receivers are calibrated using dB system as well: S1-S9, which each S-unit is equal to 6dB, and then after S-9 you have a scale that is in dB to indicate a reading up to S9+60dB, which is the peg on most communications receivers. HAMs also compare their antenna systems using the dB. We normally use an antenna that could not exist called the isotropic, which is an antenna that radiates equal in all directions. Antenna gain is more redistributing radiation in different directions, rather than actually gaining anything -- just in the direction(s) that you want.<br>  <br>  John, AD7VH|`|Ld1vLH8Kaa	It's a measurement of how loud a sound is.<br>  <br>  More decibels mean louder noise.|`|pWxhivTIaa	The decibel (dB) is a logarithmic unit of measurement.<br>  <br>  It is used in a wide variety of measurements in science and engineering, for example, sound loudness, power gain, antenna gain, signal increase, amplifier multiplication, and other disciplines. <br>  <br>  A decibel is one tenth of a bel (B).|`|3dT7f39maa	The noun DECIBEL has 1 sense:<br>  <br>  1. a logarithmic unit of sound intensity; 10 times the logarithm of the ratio of the sound intensity to some reference intensity

vHbiUhOCaa	1. Food enters the mouth where it is masticated (chewed up) until it is easier to swallow. Salivary glands in the mouth secrete the enzyme amylase which begins the break down of starch. The food is then swallowed into the oesophagus (the throat).<br>  2. The oesophagus uses muscular contractions known as peristalsis to force the food down into the stomach. Sphincters at either end of the oesophagus prevent back flow of the food.<br>  3. The stomach is the main place of digestion. It secretes many substances which help break the food down, regular convulsions mixes the food up until it is ready to be passed into the small intestine.<br>  4. While the food passes toward the small intestine, the gall bladder releases bile (which had been produced by the liver); bile emulsifies fats. Also, upon the journey of the food toward the small intestine, the pancreas releases all its digestive enzymes (amylase, protease, lipase, etc); this helps to further break the food down.<br>  5. The food has now arrived at the small intestine. The walls of the S.I are covered in millions of finger-like projections called villi, and in turn are covered in microvilli. Villi and microvilli increase surface area therefore absorption of nutrients is maximized. Once all the nutrients and minerals have been absorbed, the undigested food will now be transferred to the large intestine.<br>  6. Water absorption takes place in the large intestine. Now all the remaining undigested food can be taken to the rectum where it will be temporarily stored until excretion.<br>  7. Last place of the digestive system; the anus.

Gnfc4wRlaa	Jupiter is about 90% hydrogen and 10% helium (by numbers of atoms, 75/25% by mass) with traces of methane, water, ammonia and "rock". This is very close to the composition of the primordial Solar Nebula from which the entire solar system was formed.<br>  <br>  Above the core lies the main bulk of the planet in the form of liquid metallic hydrogen. This exotic form of the most common of elements is possible only at pressures exceeding 4 million bars, as is the case in the interior of Jupiter (and Saturn). Liquid metallic hydrogen consists of ionized protons and electrons (like the interior of the Sun but at a far lower temperature). At the temperature and pressure of Jupiter's interior hydrogen is a liquid, not a gas. It is an electrical conductor and the source of Jupiter's magnetic field. This layer probably also contains some helium and traces of various "ices".<br>  <br>  The outermost layer is composed primarily of ordinary molecular hydrogen and helium which is liquid in the interior and gaseous further out. The atmosphere we see is just the very top of this deep layer. Water, carbon dioxide, methane and other simple molecules are also present in tiny amounts.<br>  <br>  "The Jovian atmosphere is the largest planetary atmosphere in the Solar System. It is primarily made of molecular hydrogen and helium in roughly solar proportions; other chemical compounds are present only in small amounts, and include methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide and water. The latter one has not been directly observed but is thought to reside deep in the atmosphere. The oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur and noble gas abundances in Jupiter's atmosphere exceed solar values by a factor of about three."

UFteXlqwaa	Well, the humidity varies a lot from day to day and even in the course of a day, you know. Beside that, you are talking about the relative humidity, not the absolute one.<br>  <br>  The higher the temperature, the more the air can sustain moisture. When the same air cools down because, e.g. it rises, its relative humidity increases until it reaches 100 percent that is then called the dew point temperature. That's the temperature at the ceiling of the clouds.<br>  <br>  Temperature sinks also during the night and that's why you see dew on the ground early in the morning. That happens even in the desert. Some of the insects living in the desert live only on dew to survive. Dew only happens when the relative humidity is 100 percent.<br>  <br>  To compare climates, you shouldn't read the relative humidity for a certain day at a certain time but the yearly average. You will then see that Idaho, Hawaii and Florida are quite what you expect.<br>  <br>  If you are talking about humidifiers inside your home, the manufacturers generally don't recommend to have more than 45 percent relative humidity indoor. More than that and fungus and bacterias will grow too easily.<br>  <br>  Also remember that, depending on the heating or air conditioning of your home, the relative humidity inside will be very different from outside.<br>  <br>  For example, I live in Norway and the air outside is very dry. The relative humidity is perhaps average, say 80 percent. But the same air indoors, is then warmed up and while the absolute humidity, i.e. the weight of water per weight of air, is the same, the relative humidity is extremely low. In fact, the average Norwegian home in the winter has dryer air than the dryest desert on earth.|`|sx78czbxaa	The end of the world...it's coming.

No one ever knows.   <br>  <br>  As for the Sun, in about 5 billion years, the hydrogen in the core will have run out being fused into helium.  At this time, the layers surrounding the core will begin fusing hydrogen into helium as gravity will be pulling the atoms around the core tighter and tighter which builds up the temperature in these layers.  When these layers around the core start fusing it will greatly increase the temperature of these layers which will increase the push outwards and the Sun will expand to possible 200 million miles in diameter (the Sun's diameter now is 850,000 miles) and become a red giant.  At this point the Sun will probably swallow the long ago dead and lifeless Earth.<br>  <br>  Over time, as the fusion begins to slow and stop, the core's gravity won't be able to hold on to the outer layers of the Sun and the outer layers will poof off and form something that looks like the Ring Nebula,<br>  <br>  Eventually, Billions of years later, the core will cool into a white dwarf star and billions of years later will cool into a black dwarf with no heat and our solar system will be no more.<br>  <br>  Hopefully, human's by then will have learned to spend more money on your survival than you do now on your destruction and will have joined the rest of us in colonizing the galaxy.

cWuumdy7aa	Electromagnetism is the physics of the electromagnetic field: a field which exerts a force on particles that possess the property of electric charge, and is in turn affected by the presence and motion of those particles.<br>  <br>  A changing magnetic field produces an electric field (this is the phenomenon of electromagnetic induction, the basis of operation for electrical generators, induction motors, and transformers). Similarly, a changing electric field generates a magnetic field. Because of this interdependence of the electric and magnetic fields, it makes sense to consider them as a single coherent entity - the electromagnetic field.<br>  <br>  The magnetic field is produced by the motion of electric charges, i.e., electric current. The magnetic field causes the magnetic force associated with magnets.<br>  <br>  The theoretical implications of electromagnetism led to the development of special relativity by Albert Einstein in 1905.|`|S7J3OIuCaa	i just think of an electro magnet. produced by a flowing current. All currents (flowing electrons) produce a magnetic field around the current in a circular pattern. when you make the current actually go in a circle you have a straight magnetic field and therefore a concentration of similar ions. So i suppose the answer is that all things called "electromagnetic" are produced through the flow of electrons in the form of current.
zf8BnU6Yaa	Nuclear materials, fissile elements, can be brought together in what is known as a chain reaction.  This is the principle of atom bombs.  But the chain reaction can be controlled so that you don't have a bomb.  Non-bomb grade fissile uranium is used in most reactors so that you never have the potential of a nuclear explosion.  This is slightly enriched uranium in contrast to weapons grade which is highly enriched uranium. So to control the reaction there are additional materials used in the reactor which slow down and reflect the neutrons which make the chain reaction work.  In the end you have a heat source, the nuclear pile, which will be used to heat water and in the end make steam to power a turbine much like coal is used in some power plants to make steam.  But the nuclear part of the power plant is carefully controlled as the pile is capable of generating too much heat and melting components which can be dangerous as the pile would then release radioactive materials into the atmosphere.  So the controls are carefully designed to prevent this from happening.  In addition, the primary loop of water that is used to generate steam can become contaminated from stray radiation generated in the nuclear pile, or core, and is isolated from the secondary loop which is turned into steam.  This makes the nuclear generating station a bit more complex to design and build.  Eventually the nuclear material in the pile loses its effectiveness in creating heat and the fuel, in the form of rods, needs to be replaced which then requires some place to store these rods as they are radioactive. This process has been controversial since an accident in the Three Mile Island generating station which resulted in the loss of one of the units and created a scare about nuclear power.  So the safety measures required when building a new nuclear power generating station are much more detailed than for a gas turbine or coal fired generating station. I've been inside a plant and while they look complicated, they all have real functions and make sense.|`|qaMPEdL2aa	You need to have stuff to control the temperature and pressure at which the plant operates.  You have pumps that pump the water to be able to extract more power from the core than you could by natural circulation.  Pressurized water reactors have loops of pipe that carry the hot pressurized water to a heat exchanger that creates the steam in another loop to separate the turbine from the somewhat radioactive coolant that is pumped through the nuclear core.  You have multiple loops because the expensive core can power more than one turbine.  You have cooling water systems to carry away the heat from the windings of the pumps.  You have piping for systems to be able to maintain the water chemistry to minimize corrosion and to remove any corrosion products that occur. You have valves to isolate the loops in case there is a leak.  You have hydraulic control of those valves which involves more pipes and pumps.<br>  <br>  As in many things, the devil is in the details.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	yeah it kinda is that simple<br>  <br>  im only 18 but i researched it<br>  <br>  it costs so much because it takes a of stuff to stop nuclear disasters from happening within the plants <br>  i think there are so many tubes and stuff to get rid of the nuclear waste and to process it the right way<br>  and to not cause the radiation to leak|`|xWEYZWjZaa	Yes, in the core that's it.<br>  But:<br>  It is very hard to control amount of energy radiated and purpose of all additional 'hardware' to enable control as well as radiation protection to environment.
O7rMKLEMaa	I assume that you are wishing for a natural unit of time which is the same everywhere, which is millions or billions of years long, and which facilitates cosmological discussions. The nearest thing I am aware of to fulfilling your requirements is the time it takes for expansion at the rate of 2.5 x 10^-18/sec to double the distance between two distant galaxies. This is the concept of scale factor. The present epoch is defined as scale factor = 1. A past time when distant galaxies were half as far apart is scale factor 1/2. A future time when they will be twice as far apart is scale factor 2. <br>  <br>  Translating scale factor to years requires several assumptions about the nature of cosmological expansion, and we really don't understand it that well. Supernova type 1A data suggest that the rate of expansion is increasing, but even that depends on some assumptions which most scientists don't even know they are making. <br>  <br>  Alternatively, you can make the really crazy assumption that you know the age of the universe is 13.7 billion years and the equally crazy assumption that the expansion rate never changes; then you get the standard meaning of scale factor. <br>  <br>  I have my own Fractal Foam Model of Universes in which I define scale factor zero as the ratio of mean bubble size in the cosmic foam to mean bubble size in the ether foam. Presently, that ratio is roughly 10^59. Cosmic foam bubbles are roughly 10^24 meters across, and ether foam bubbles are rought 10^-35 meter across (the Planck length). <br>  <br>  Scale factor = 1, in my model, is a hypothetical epoch when the mean bubble size in the cosmic foam was the same as the mean bubble size in the ether foam (i.e. cosmic foam bubble were one Planck length across). I recognize that turning the clock back that far is utterly ridiculous, regardless of whether you believe my model or the Big Bang model.|`|QPWjtDzcaa	David D has the best answer, IMO, but I think I should point out a few things in your question, at least as I see them:<br>  <br>  What is an average star?<br>  <br>  A red dwarf? <br>  <br>  We seem to have many more of those than anything else.<br>  <br>  The first ones of these to form have not yet exhausted their fusing supply of hydrogen.  They live for (speculative, of course) trillions of years.  Our best estimates put the univere at a youthful 13.7 billion years.  Perhaps 0.07 units of this time you suggest.<br>  <br>  Or did you mean something like a star as massive as the sun.  Like a lifespan of a 1 solar mass star, roughly 10 billion years?  That puts our universe at about 1.4 of these units.  These numbers are only really useful to cosmology.<br>  <br>  The solar year might be a little more of a do-able unit of time.  Somewhere along the lines of 26,000 years (precession).  <br>  <br>  Or possibly a unit of time comparable to the orbital period of our sun around the galaxy?  That would make more sense to me. Roughly 225 million years.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think conceptually, these things haven't caught on.  For the number of uses these units of time have, I think the vast majority of the people in the world who would apply these time scales in life, are familiar enough with scientific notation for it to not be as analagous to the light years vs. kilometers situation.|`|f1beDbKIaa	As Dave said, the time standard is the second.<br>  <br>  We have minutes, hours, days, fortnights, months (though they're not all the same length), years, decades, centuries, and millennia.

The are too many stars out there to pick and choose as a cosmic standard and you don't want too many people picking their own standards.  It is bad enough that some people pick and choose whether or not to observe daylight savings time.  We know, that for the next 4.5 to 5 billion years, Earth will likely be about it's same orbit, same rotation on axis, etc.  The values may change slightly due to the fact that things do change, such as the Moon is moving further away (slowly).<br>  We'll suffer the same problems, if not more, by picking some other celestial body that we can not observe as well as the one we see every day in the sky.<br>  <br>  Atomic time would be the best.

A second is a very practical unit of time and can be used to describe from the shortest to the longest  events using scientific notation.

Year being too short? Months. Hours. Seconds. And so on.|`|3f49d1173ab44657705ae3106bb11dc6aa	Time measurement is based on the standard second.  The orbit of the Earth around the Sun is much, much too in imprecise.<br>  <br>  Considering that a very precise definition of the unit of time is indispensable for the International System, the 13th CGPM (1967) decided to replace the definition of the second by the following (affirmed by the CIPM in 1997 that this definition refers to a cesium atom in its ground state at a temperature of 0 K): <br>  <br>  The second is the duration of 9 192 631 770 periods of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two hyperfine levels of the ground state of the cesium 133 atom.<br>  <br>  The accuracy of atomic clocks has steadily improved.  The uncertainty of NIST-F1 is continually improving. In 2000 the uncertainty was about 1 x 10-15, but as of the summer of 2005, the uncertainty has been reduced to about 5 x 10-16, which means it would neither gain nor lose a second in more than 60 million years!<br>  <br>  New clocks are being developed.  A new clock based on a single trapped atom of Mercury.  This new clock utilizes a new device called an "optical comb."   The current version of NIST-F1—if it were operated continuously—would neither gain nor lose a second in about 60 million years. The latest version of the mercury clock would neither gain nor lose a second in about 400 million years.

2gjfFsYKaa	Your irregular mass has mass M (known) and volume V (unknown).  Remove the mass from the spring. Mark that point - that's zero on the spring. Re-hang the mass; that's W (weight in air). Now hang the mass in the fluid and mark the point. We assume that the spring is linear, so you now know the weight of the mass in the fluid as a fraction of W. The bouyant force is <br>  <br>  p g V<br>  <br>  where p is the (unknown) density of the fluid and V is the volume of the mass (known because you know mass and density), so the effective weight is<br>  <br>  W - p g V<br>  <br>  To determine the spring constant (with one data point) just note that<br>  <br>  W = mg = kx <br>  <br>  You know m, g, and x; solve for k.

What is the probability that you have the million dollar case?  It is still 1/3, correct?  Yes, it is.<br>  <br>  Okay, but now let's open that case.  I open it and it has $1 million in it.  Now what's the probability you have the million?  It's 0%?  The probabilities *did* change.  You've just proven your friend wrong.<br>  <br>  Okay, and if the other case is *not* $1 million?  What's the probability that you have the 1 million?  Indeed the probability will go up...<br>  <br>  This is called *conditional* probability.  The probability that you have the million dollars *given* that you have seen another case with only $1 changes the probability.  It makes it 1/2 now.  The reason the probability has gone up is because certain outcomes have been eliminated.<br>  <br>  Probability is desired outcomes divided by possible outcomes.  In your new situtation you have eliminated the possibility that the opened case had $1 million in it.  That changes the probability.<br>  <br>  However, I think what your friend is arguing is that in the end, the probability that you will have the million dollars is still 1/3.  If you figure out all the outcomes of the game, you will still win 1/3 of the time.  That won't change.|`|3Y5NFybLaa	lol your friend's a dumbass.

That means that at least one of their parents was Aa, resulting in the possibility of AA, Aa, Aa, and aa. The albinism gene is recessive and hence does not cause albinism unless a person inherits two copies of the gene for albinism in other words if there is no gene that makes the normal pigment. So parents both aa will have children with albinism (aa by aa yields aa,aa,aa,aa)|`|QD03bB8Aaa	it is a recessive characteristic; theoretically anyone can produce an albino child. but the probability of all the children of parents both of whom are albinos being albinos is high.|`|vUAfLHxiaa	To have an albino child BOTH parents must have the gene for it.

XXyHd0AQaa	Going forwards in time is relatively simple and most people have probably done it. I mean obviously we are moving forwards in time as we speak, but traveling more into the future is also possible. Basically, the faster you move, the slower time moves. So if you flew from the UK to america, you would go into the future by about 40 nanoseconds. Not a lot i know but still technically time travel. So physics allows us to time travel, we just don't have the technology to move fast enough for it to be noticeable. So yes, time travel IS possible right now.<br>  <br>  Going back in time is a bit more difficult. There are no laws making traveling backwards in time impossible. We would have to travel through a wormhole but this is only in theory and would be impossible to do at the present as we don't have the knowledge or technology to make it possible. Also, when traveling backwards in time, there is the trouble of paradox's which complicates things more.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Maybe someone in the future will be able to answer that question.|`|AA11526235	As nearly as I can figure out, we can travel to the future by living in the present.

Water is also lost through the stomata through a process called transpiration, however when there isn't enough water in the plants tissues, the stomata close up to try and limit any further water loss.

AqtNEBagaa	Mastodons or Mastodonts are members of the extinct genus Mammut of the order Proboscidea and form the family Mammutidae; they resembled, but were distinct from, the woolly mammoth, which belongs to the family Elephantidae. Mastodons were browsers, while mammoths were grazers.<br>  While mastodons were furry like woolly mammoths and similar in height at roughly three meters at the shoulder, the resemblance was superficial. They differed from mammoths primarily in the blunt, conical, nipple-like projections on the crowns of their molars, which were more suited to chewing leaves than the high-crowned teeth mammoths used for grazing; the name mastodon (or mastodont) means "nipple teeth" and is also an obsolete name for their genus. Their skulls were larger and flatter than those of mammoths, while their skeleton was stockier and more robust. A few skeletons have been found with the fur still attached; examination of the hair suggests that mastodons also lacked the undercoat characteristic of mammoths.<br>  The tusks of the mastodon sometimes exceeded five meters in length and were nearly horizontal, in contrast with the more curved mammoth tusks.
G3LpGWXbaa	Normally, the molecules than make up air have very few free electrons. This means that almost all of the electrons are trapped and cannot be easily moved by a force differential (Voltage).<br>  <br>  An interesting note: When very high voltages are present, such as during arcing, the gases around the arc are ionized. Ionized gases do have free electrons readily available. This is because the force (Voltage) was great enough to separate trapped electrons. Once a gas becomes ionized it becomes a very good conductor. Lightning is an example of air being ionized and conducting electricity.<br>  <br>  Read this:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized_gas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionized_gas</a>|`|U4V6TkZEaa	Air is an insulator because normally the atoms are far apart, so it is difficult for electrons to jump from molecule to molecule.|`|zp6aj3Jnaa	air is not a very good insulator, at 1000V per mm air will ionize and become very good conductor indeed. glass, ceramics, teflon etc are way better. a good insulator lacks free electrons as opposed to good conductors(like metals) and is hard to ionize(when ionized atoms reach higher energy state and electrons leave the atom, releasing photons when they return)

5HTylrjGaa	I think you're confusing transcription and replication.<br>  <br>  There is no helicase unwinding DNA during transcription. The RNA Polymerase actually has helicase activity within it. It unwinds several base pairs before it, and at the same time it closes several base pairs behind it that it has transcribed already. So that's why you don't need a gyrase. It's too local, and only several base pairs are getting unwound, and each one that gets unwound, another one gets wound that has already been transcribed.<br>  <br>   During replication, the initiator protein unwinds the DNA a little bit, just so that helicase can attach. You can't use an intiator protein because it can't travel down DNA (not processive) and it doesn't unwind DNA fast enough (DNA Polymerase makes new DNA pretty fast). You would need a gyrase for this process.

LVPNuEsLaa	Engineering is VERY specific.  As a civil engineer you would be trained on large-scale structural engineering - roads, bridges, and the like.  This would not at all qualify you to work on engines, circuits, or the operating guts of nuclear power plants - all different fields of engineering.  Even construction work (buildings, homes) usually goes to different fields: Architectural or Structural engineers.<br>  <br>  There is a little bit of crossover, and you might be able to work in closely related fields (for civil that would be structural), but it is not guaranteed.<br>  <br>  So decide what you want to work on, figure out the correct degree, and go after that.  Once you pick, you're stuck for a while.|`|Moz2d806aa	It depends. There is a lot of crossover done in engineering. Most jobs in industry do not actually use what was learned in engineering school, but they require the scientific thinking/problem solving and intelligence of an engineer. Therefore, you would be qualified for jobs in fields such as quality/process/industrial/manufacturing... etc.

ACtJqgTCaa	There is only theory - wild owls have not been filmed hunting at night. You are talking about the larger owls, such as the European Eagle Owl (Bubo bubo) - there was a big stir up when they have been found all around the UK due to careless idiots who decided that a 5-14 pound uncontrollable wild animal would make their d**ks look big. But eagle owls can fly. They made it out into the wild.<br>  <br>  Crows are clever, gregarious birds and in the daylight I have seen them chase eagle owls and force them to the ground in defence of their territory and nests. However a sleeping crow at night is no match for an eagle owl. Owls have an astonishing sense of hearing - a barn owl can hear a mouse's heart beat at 20 paces. Also they have no colour vision (pretty useless in the day) due to the high ratio of rods:cones in their retinas, but this also means that they can see much better in the dark (rods are the light-sensitive cell fragments in the retina). Crows on the other hand can not see in the dark at all (not even as well as we can), as soon as the light leaves they can't see a thing. That is because they have excellent colour vision during the day.<br>  <br>  Eagle owls have also been used in falconry to hunt crows, but that is a bit different.<br>  <br>  I have no doubt in my mind that a sleeping crow has no chance against an eagle owl. However what worries me is endangered species: they have been known to take sleeping diurnal birds of prey such as buzzards (way bigger and more predatory than crows). Therefore.......barn owls, merlins, hen harriers, other endangered birds of prey are at risk. Crows, well...they are not welcome in the countryside, there are far too many and they are very destructive. They have grown in number because we humans make their lives easy.|`|en65MKIMaa	No, but there is certainly evidence against it, as cows are much larger and heavier than anything an owl could lift or attack.

UFteXlqwaa	That is an interesting question because, until the Renaissance, people believed that meteorology and astronomy were the same thing. Of course, clouds, sun and moon were all "up there" and they had no idea how far away they were from each other. Copernicus discovery of the heliocentricity changed all that! ... but I digress.<br>  <br>  Yes, people, including myself, have noticed slight changes in the weather during an eclipse. But I can't say anything about "before" the eclipse. There is no way the weather can "sense" that the sun will be entirely or partly gone for a while.<br>  <br>  But, when it happens, as I have noticed it myself some years ago and last summer, a slight drop in the temperature can be noticed and even the birds start singing again. I am sure there are many other examples of nature "missing a beat" when a solar eclipse happens.<br>  <br>  Winds can also be slightly affected, such as sea breeze near a coast or katabatic / anabatic winds in the mountains. But certainly not by a great effect. After all, an eclipse doesn't last that long.|`|3c7af99d45cd29de4b5830261c158f92aa	I don't think so. The Moon is always going around the Earth and there's no reason for it to alter the weather more just because its path goes exactly over the position of the Sun. The Moon goes around that position all the time, if it were a factor it would happen more often.<br>  <br>  Maybe if the Sun eclipses the Moon...|`|lHpbCKpCaa	No, change of weather depends upon the tilting of earth on its axis, since earth does not tilt in result of any Eclipse, solar or lunar, the change of weather is solely dependant upon the constatnt tilting of Earth's axis, a complete 360 circle is performed in 365 days of solar celandar by earth in order to have the 4 seasons we know! How ever the change in patterns of tilt due to global warming can have tremendous effect on weather patterns  now that the balance is disturbed, Melting glaciers are just a prelude to some devastating effects, including sunrise from west, no longer depending upon earth having to stop spin and reverse its rotation, but experiments reveal that a simple flip  of titlts half way beyond balanced limit results in sunruse from west, or atleast it will be so for atleast half of the day till sun rises from normal again, but it will be the earth flipped over or returned back to original position for a short while before new form of earth quakes will appear, gravitaional quakes, as if a moving magnet under a paper pulling the nails heither and theither!

df7bf836aea5d7c83e8e3ffb0bf38d9baa	The cause of the predator increase and decrease is due to the increase and decrease of their major prey species. If the prey species has a particularly bad year, you'll see the predator species decline as well. Note that the decrease or increase of the predator species will always be behind that of the prey species - there is a time lag. The increase of prey will mean more pups will survive the next year and slowly increase the population (it isn't instantaneous). The decline of a prey species (for instance, due to starvation) will mean more food in the shortrun for the predator but then some adults will die off and many pups will not survive meaning future populations will be lower.<br>  For a good example of a predator prey relationship that has been well documented, do a search on the isle royale project.<br>  <a href="http://www.wolfmoose.mtu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wolfmoose.mtu.edu/</a>|`|a9Syspyiaa	As prey levels go up, predator levels will shortly follow, eating more prey.  That causes a drop in prey levels, being eaten more.  Followed by a drop in predator levels, starving.|`|JbBCuYI5aa	Predators are animals that use aerobic respiration. how they capture their prey is through a network of webs and poison spells that they use. now if you were to put this on a graph it would look something like a bell curve. increase in prey levels is caused by an increase in dominating mitochondria which control the prey's cellular levels. after this the predator increases because there is more poison spells that can be done.

Use the normally closed Auxiliary points to turn the light on when your contactor is in open position remember that the auxiliary needs a power supply you can use the battery.

Then when the switch is closed, there will be basically no voltage across the bulb and it won't light.  The trouble of course is that the current in the circuit will be limited only by the battery's internal resistance, so the wire's likely to get very hot and the battery will run out quickly.   It's actually possible for the battery to explode, or the wire to melt, or a fire to start, so please don't actually build this circuit.  If you had an extra resistance to put in series with the light bulb, which would limit the current when the switch is closed, it would be much safer (at the cost of having the light bulb be dimmer.)<br>  <br>  A safe, effective way to demonstrate this would be to use a LED instead of a light bulb and a current limiting resistor (nearly always used when lighting up LEDs from batteries.)|`|buLqy1b3aa	Put a mosfet in series with the light bulb.  The supply voltage must be across the light bulb, and your input voltage must be at the gate of the mosfet.  For an nMOS, the transistor will conduct when input voltage is high, making the light turn on.  When the voltage is low, no current will pass through the MOSFET or the light bulb.

disDe49Laa	I think that you mean points of inflection, points where the second derivative is zero. To do this on a TI-89 is simple. First, tell your calculator to take the first derivative of the given function using the built in derivative function. Now, tell it to take the derivative of this derivation. Then go to the algebra menu which is F2 on the home screen and set the second derivative equation equal to 0 and tell the calculator to solve the equation with respect to your independent variable, which is most probably x or t. These solutions are your possible points of inflection. Then graph the original function to see if these are the points where the original function changes from concave up to concave down and visa verse. However, this method, neglects the possibility that your second derivative does not exist. You must find these values by hand since your calculator does not have a built in function for this. And after all of that, you should have all points of inflection and be able to verify them on your TI-89.|`|c3988adee76bb2df1e09bf7fdb3893bbaa	A POI occurs when f"(x) = 0<br>  So find 2nd derivativ of f(x), set it to zero and s0lve for x.

O7rMKLEMaa	Everything below geostationary orbit (22,236 miles) has more weight than centrifugal force. Everything above 22,236 miles has more centrifugal force than weight. For the SE to stay up, it must have at least as much tension pulling from above 22,236 miles as from below. One way to balance the forces is to make the cable (or ribbon) extremely long; but carbon nanotubes (CNT's) are expensive, and they are targets for space junk. <br>  <br>  You can reduce the length of the CNT's by putting a counterweight at the top. It needs to be pretty far above geostationary orbit in order to have enough centrifugal force to lift everything below it. The counterweight can then be moved higher or lower to maintain the minimum necessary tension at the middle and bottom. <br>  <br>  When a heavy load is added at the bottom, you have to move the counterweight higher to lift the load. As the load nears geostationary height, the counterweight can be moved lower. If you don't lower the counterweight as the load rises, you will get too much tension at the bottom.|`|baaf30673b204103b269ddf718be2c5caa	If there wasn't one, it would take exactly the same amount of energy as a rocket to go up, so would be pointless.

He said her diameter is 4,200 miles.<br>  <br>  Astonishing photographic data from NASA’s Viking and Mars Surveyor space probes—which show what appears to be artificial, intelligently-designed structures (including a Martian sphinx-like face, massive pyramids, a city complex and underground glass tunnels) in the region of Mars known as Cydonia, and elsewhere on that planet—confirms the revelations and prophecies of the Hon.

Some people really really want to find evidence of life, regardless of what the evidence indicates!<br>  <br>  excerpts:<br>  So why did people think life was found?<br>  Tiny globules of minerals called carbonates, with even tinier oval and tube-shaped objects on the surface. Limestone and marble, for example, consist mainly of carbonate minerals. However, the key paper6 concedes that ‘The origin of these globules is controversial’, and that they could have formed by processes unconnected with life. In particular, there is some evidence that they were formed at a temperature far too hot for life.<br>  <br>  Molecules called PAHs (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, many of which are strong cancer-causing agents). However, these molecules are not always produced by living things. They are commonly found in soot and diesel exhaust. Also, 'PAHs are very widespread compounds in asteroids and not diagnostic of life' according to Robert Clayton, a geochemist at the University of Chicago. He also pointed out that PAHs in fossils have about a thousand times the variety of those in this rock.7<br>  <br>  Another possibility is that these chemicals are from Earth and contaminated the meteorite once it was here. Richard Zare, who headed the chemistry team, tried to rule out this explanation because there are more PAHs deep inside the rock than on the surface, whereas contaminants would tend to affect the surface more than the inside. But Robert Gregory, a geologist at Southern Methodist University points out that water could seep into the many fissures in the rock and concentrate PAHs on the inside, while those on the surface would be destroyed by UV light.8 <br>  <br>  Certain iron compounds. The rock contains a mineral called magnetite, also called lodestone (which was used in the first compasses), as well as another mineral similar to 'fool's gold'. These minerals can be formed by living organisms or by processes having nothing to do with life. It is the occurrence of these minerals together which suggests (to some) that they were formed by living cells. But the researchers haven't ruled out all possible non-living processes.|`|3b5eRua3aa	Right now, the focus of the Martian research is on looking for water, to see if the environment on Mars could once have supported life. In this case, they are looking at 'life' as Earth-type life (carbon-based). If there is life on Mars at all, it would be very small organisms (bacteria or other microscopic organisms). A meteorite was found in Antarctica several years ago which looks like it may have fossilized bacteria on it. Whether these are really bacteria or not is under debate. The Mars Science Laboratory rover (if it succeeds) is supposed to look for hydrocarbons as part of it's mission on Mars in another step in the mission to find life on Mars. But basically, right now there is no conclusive evidence to say that there is life on Mars.|`|vPqk1SGHaa	If you wanted to know what your teacher means by 'science' you should have asked him. The rest of us can only guess. <br>  Most people by 'science' means observations and rational conclusions. <br>  In case of Mars, no signs of life has been observed. It has been reported that Mars atmosphere has no oxygen. The average surface temperature is -80 C and atmospheric pressure is about 1% of that on Earth so that water can not exist in the liquid form on the surface of Mars. From these observations one can reasonably conclude that there is no life on the surface of Mars. (Mars has deep canyons that have not been explored yet so the conditions there might be different.)

1Qy3hqUUaa	Minerals belonging to a solid-solution series continuously react with the surrounding liquid as it cools. A good example of a solid solution mineral is plagioclase. A cooling crystal wants to attain equilibrium with the surrounding melt. However, diffusion and ion exchanges is commonly too slow for the whole crystal to adjust to changing conditions i.e. falling temperature. This results in that only the rims of the crystals are able to reach equilibrium with the melt. This is called compositional zoning. The most common of comp. zoning is concentric zoning. This is when zones are parallel to the advancing crystal faces. This zoning reflects the growth hsitory of the crystal. <br>  <br>  Google image : zoning in plagioclase you can see some nice examples|`|xOh6IXWsaa	Zoning in crystal is the difference between the inner core of the crystal and its outer rim.  It's usually caused by a change in the composition of the crystal, showing a difference in the composition of the fluid the crystal crystallized from, i.e. the chemical composition of the core of the crystal is different to the outside, causing a change in the optical properties and appearing to us as zones within the crystal.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/187_IR/chap_05/images/05_f02.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www-odp.tamu.edu/publications/187...</a><br>  <br>  In the picture I've posted the link to, look at the large crystal , see how the colours change as you move towards the edge from the center?
