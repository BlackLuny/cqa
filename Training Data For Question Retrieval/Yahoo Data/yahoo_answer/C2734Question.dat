20080328230821AAaxX4Z	Pets;Cats	My cat loves to smell my body and my used clothes, he also drools whilst doing it. Why?	Any good reason?   I've got two cats, only one loves to do that. In fact this is the first cat to ever do that in my whole life petting cats.      He will smell my armpits area and drools... and smell my used clothes and drools. I don't think it's normal since this I've never encountered such thing before. In fact, he's been doing it since he was small (everyone else thought he was looking for milk, but I knew that's not wot he was looking for!)

Our family has had the sweetest border collie for 11 years, and he is very mild. The younger puppy tends topick fights with the older dog, which mainly consist of him biting the older dog. How can I 1) tell whether they're playing or not, 2) tell if the older dog is being hurt, and 3) get the puppy to not do it so much? Thanks!

20061004132612AAN9Jhn	Pets;Dogs	What to do?	Ok we got a Chihuahua and I know now that was the wrong decision for our family due to I have a toddler and she can't stop playing with the puppy(6 months old), So I am going to talk it over with my hubby about adopting him to a family or someone without small children. I am wondering if a Husky or Greman Shepard would be better because they are bigger and more durable to handle a child who loves puppies and want to play with them all the time.   We moniter our daughter when she plays with the puppy we have now and we displine her and let her know what she can and can not do with the puppy now and I know she is still young but I am affriad the with the puppy we have now and how small he is and his bones I don't want to take the chance of him getting seriuosly hurt. I know with a bigger dog they are a little more durable and thier bones are not that small but still the same effect can happen. So I am just wondering if a bigger breed of dog would be better with a small child.

20090226114435AAGBtZl	Pets;Dogs	Is this an ethical breeder?  When should a separate breed be made?	I asked a version of this yesterday, but I wasn't clear.  I'm going to try again.       I met a man with a Whippet that did not look like a whippet.     45-60lbs    not a "bully" whippet   a strange fawn apricot colour with sable shading   Very large boned   Probably 24"-28" at the withers      He explained that he's a racing whippet and that he does very well at racing.  He breeds him to try and make the perfect race dog.       Now, we know that ethical breeders breed to make the perfect dog, whether that's a herding dog, protection dog, companion dog, whatever.  He's breeding a dog to be a great racedog, but is substantially sacrificing the breed standard to do so.        Question 1:  Is this breeding ethical?   Question 2:  Should this dog still be considered a Whippet (despite being "purebred")?       Hypothetical Portion: If it doesn't look like a whippet and is faster and stronger than a standard whippet, is it still a whippet?  Or should it be a subset breed?  Another type of sighthound?

My stepmom couldn't get over how well behaved they were for their age (Sasha wasn't even a year old yet)      Well we are going back over Easter.   Our goal is to move out there and we are working toward that.      Sasha didn't like the car trip....she was fine once we got there though.   We got half way before we had to give her anything.      The vet said if she got nervous and car sick to give her a benedryl.    So half way through we gave her one and we found out when we got to NC that she hadn't taken it (and she was a nervous wreck)  She calmed down quickly after the car ride      When we were getting ready to go back we decided to give her the pill before we got going and she grabbed that out of my hand and she was fine the whole way back.      So how can I make the car ride more comfortable for her.   Trust me the trip was less traumatic to her than being boarded.      She if fine when we get there but those 8 hours are rough

Ok.....so today when I was walking Blaze (my Husky) I encountered 2 dogs that where not properly contained...or controlled...first was a Pit Bull and let me tell you it scared the crap outta me...all I heard was a dog bark and next thing I know there is a full grown Pitt barreling at my dog...now I do not know how Blaze will react...he gets along well with dogs but you never know, and I of course did not know what the pitts intentions were...the owner immediately ran outside and was like I am really really sorry...he is friendly...which it most likely was I do not doubt his dog was friendly....I told him it was ok...but I really wanted to yell at him because there are a lot of people who have misconceptions about the breed... and could have possibly hurt his dog...or his dog could have gotten hit by a car...   Second dog did not run over to me and my dog but growled and barked at him.      My questions is how am I supposed to react to a situation like that...   When ever another dog runs up to my dog I automatically pull Blaze into me and hold his face as close my body as possible. And try to not face the dog so I can avoid a possible dog fight.   Am I supposed to do something else??      And Should I feed my dog before or after I take him for a walk???

I have been told by some of my opponents that when I do run him, he won't be as good as their horses that they paid several thousand for.  What is the deal with all this?  I have ran barrels for 20 years, never had a horse I paid more than $3500 for and still did super.  I really want to know this, would you rather have someone else train your barrel horse, or train it yourself?  I am working with 2 now, and the older one that was a barrel horse previously is giving me more problems than the young one that is barely over green.

We have another ragdoll that is very well behaved and pretty much just keeps to himself and sense they're brothers we figured this new cat would be the same. boy were we wrong. the new cat (sammy) is always doing something bad. well, not necessarily bad but really annoying! like at night he'll literally sit 2 inches from you face and purr really loud and paw and lick at you. its so loud that i wake up several times a night. i take him out of my room the first few times he wakes me up but he just sits at my door and meows the whole time when i do that. its not just me either, when i lock him out he'll go to my brother's room and do the same thing. he also throws up A LOT (especially since i've been locking him out of my room). i'm pretty sure he does this when he gets upset (he did this at my grandma's house too whenever she would kick him out of her room or whenever he didnt have his way...) i would just simply give him away but my mom won't let us and my grandmother has recently passed away so we can't give it back to her. any suggestions on what i should do?!      he's driving me nuts!      thanks!      :)      p.s. this breed of cat we already know from out previous ragdoll are very affectionate and attached to their owners but i never imagined he'd be this attached/affectionate.

20090226120158AAbIDtK	Pets;Horses	A horse i cant handle?	Ok, so i go horse riding, but i hadn't been for quite a while. The horse i ride... she is....Ok she is plain out stubborn. I am having lots of trouble with her. She wouldn't go when i tell her, she wouldn't stop when i tell her (well she does stop, but she cant really stay put for long) and im just getting real tired of her. Last time she would always put her head down and made my hands hurt A LOT (well not much i can do about that). Usually when i ride her, i use a Stick, but my trainer said i wouldn't have 1 next time, which is tomorrow. I am a bit nervous that i would look like a idiot that can't handle my horse (well im actually a begginer but still, i don't wanna make my self look weird). If you have any tips how to show my horse that i would be REAL HAPPY if she listens, please bring it on!       Do you think that if i simply go more often she would get used to me?   My trainer always says i have to kick her hard, but i do and still doesn't work... :|      any advise? i'm really nervous!

20090226113758AAtrUV5	Pets;Dogs	Boyfriend's family living with us! HELP!!!!?	Wow- I had no idea what category to put this question in. I've asked a couple questions similar to this awhile back- I'm not sure where I should even start- OKAY- My boyfriend's mother and 3 sisters + one sister's boyfriend have moved in with us- His mother is going through a divorce, and has two 11 year olds and a 20 year old. Very long story- But basically we are all living together now.    All in all it's been a bit harder than i had anticipated...I could go on forever about the things that irritate me- BUT the biggest one at the moment would have to be with my 6 month old maltese.   His mother has a dog too, whom she has "trained" in ways I'd never want my maltese to behave...For example before they moved in my dog was trained to use the restroom outside- After they moved in he has begun using the "potty pads" which are placed all over the house for her dog- I expressed in the beginning that i was against training Louie to use the potty pads, but that wasn't heard- I mean she never exactly "trained" him, he just picked it up from the other dog.    When i am at work or at school- I try to leave louie in what little space is "ours", we have the master bedroom- She feels badly for him and lets him out to have free run of the whole house- He has already torn up carpet, etc...Which isn't his fault, he is a puppy and there was a lack of supervision. They feed him people food or whatever he wants- Etc...It's seriously making me crazy!!! Louie doesn't even listen to my boyfriend or me anymore. He has absolutely no manners...Is allowed and encouraged to bark, take food from their hands...jump up on their laps when they are eating...ETC...He isn't scolded for using the bathroom wherever he pleases-    I've expressed a MILLION times that i would appreciate if they just let Louie be until i could come home and care for him- I work very close to home so come home at least twice a day- My boyfriend on the other hand works all day, sometimes 10+ hours..   They will follow my requests for a little while until it all goes out the window again and Louie is back to doing whatever he pleases. I end up scolding him and am sure i'm seen as the bad guy in his eyes-    I don't know what to do anymore- It's sooo frustrating, he is a very expensive AKC maltese and I feel all the training I've been through with him has gone out the window. They see no problem with how he acts...Anyone been through anything like this??? Any advice?? I have no idea what to do any longer...

20090226120654AAzAdYS	Pets;Cats	My cat is being neutered today; I'm house sitting for the next week. Should I bring him with?	I'm house-sitting my parent's house and their animals until next week. My parents said it'd be okay to bring him to their house while they we're gone but I'm not sure if I should. My parents have a yellow lab who is a big wimp and two 17 year old male cats with no personality who pretty much just sit in the basement. My cat is very personable. I don't want to leave him alone all this time, especially right after the neuter, (of course I'd make daily trips back for a little bit) but I'm not sure if he'd be okay acclimating to my parent's house or if between the neuter and the change of environment it would be too much for him to handle. Does anyone have any experience or a better idea of how the animal interactions would go?

20090226101200AACfNGl	Pets;Horses	How much do you think my horse is worth (with picture)?	She is an 8 year old, 17hh registered American Warmblood by Glacier Bay.   "Hannah Bay" has three fabulous gaits, including a very adjustable, balanced canter. She has jumped 3'6" courses under saddle, but can free jump up to 5'6".       She isn't an easy keeper, and she needs a lot of beet pulp (but no grain- it makes her crazy). She also performs better when on Regumate in the summer and "Be Calm", a supplement with Tryptophan. I haven't used either for the last year- but for someone with less experience with this horse it would probably be necessary.      Hannah has three summers of showing under her belt, but for the last three years it's been back to basics for her. We have focused on making her more supple and controllable. She used to ride in a waterford pelham and a martingale, but now she's fine in just a full cheek snaffle.      She is unpredictable and  has a tendency to injure herself. Most of the time she's great, but she will have very bad "mare days" where she is dangerous to handle. This is why I am selling her, and I'm curious about how much she is worth. She's very flashy, with a serious "wow" factor. When she is dangerous, experienced people can handle her, and I can, but there are a lot of children at the barn where I keep my horses and she is definitely not safe around children.      So, my question is, how much do you think she is worth? She has the  ability to go to the TOP of the jumper ring, but she needs a very experienced rider and hanlder. What do you think?      Here's a link to the picture:       http://c2.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...

Hello, I have been wanting a ferret for the longest time ( about 4 years ) and my parents never let me buy one when I lived at home.

20090226113838AA761TN	Pets;Rodents	Should I do anything?	I have 2 chinese hamsters, and I took them out to clean their cages (they are separated) before I left the house for 2 days.      I cleaned the cages, brought one hamster through and put it in. I then cleaned the wheels, and seesaws etc, and put them back in the cages.      I then went to bed, then left the next day. Someone was here to change the water and food.      When I came back today, I saw one of the hamsters in its cleaning cage. I immediately placed it back in the cage and gave it some extra water in a bowl and a chunk of Cucumber. Should I do anything else? The hamster was without food or water in the cleaning cage, and it was my fault for not remembering that I hadn't put him back in. And I was unable to check because I was out the house for the entire following day.

20090226115210AANZhfb	Pets;Dogs	Will my small breed puppy not be healthy since she was spayed at 8 weeks?	My puppy’s breeder spays/neuters all of their puppies before the babies go to their new homes. They have a reputable vet who is very knowledgeable with juvenile spay/neuter. Their puppy’s have never had any complications from the early altering, and are happy and healthy.      My was concerned with it, and stated that because of this my puppy will have some serious issues with her urinary tract when she gets older. I was able to locate a web site that had some information regarding that. They say that ovariohysterectomized females may be prone to urinary incontinence. Vulvar in-folding occurs in females spayed prepubertally that maintains an infantile vulva to a more infantile form. There is no evidence to support a hypothesis that age at gonadectomy would affect onset or progression of either problem.      It also said that currently available information indicates that early spay and neuter is a safe procedure. I know that early spay or neuter surgery is quick, qith minimal bleeding and quick recovery. I guess my concern is just the welfare of my puppy. I am just wanting her for a pet, nothing more – just to join my family and become a loved member who I can spoil and pamper. She is a Chihuahua, and both of her parents are in great health. The breeder is very responsible – her dogs are all in her home, and are well taken care of.      She is current on her shots, spayed, and micro-chipped too. I am just leery that I am going to be taking home a constant vet bill/worry… and will be dealing with urinary tract problems through out her life. I would be sad to forfeit my deposit and not adopt her… but I just want a healthy puppy.      Any input would be appreciated.

20090226123740AAA74xQ	Pets;Other - Pets	How come tenants can't have pets, but the landlords can?!?	I never understood that. If I were a landlord, I would allow my tenants to have pets as long as the pets were fixed, box trained, and VERY clean. Especially if I, myself, had pets. I really don't think it's fair. Is anyone else going through this problem with their landlords?
20090226125048AAQ74SS	Pets;Dogs	So.. will I no longer be a responsible breeder if I...?	get another dog of yet another breed?      Here's the situation -    I've been a Samoyed breeder/exhibitor for 20+ years (grandparents bred them as well)   6 years ago (after 2 years of study) I added a Bernese.  I've since started breeding Bernese (6 years- 2 litters)   My partner (who pays most of the bills) REALLY wants a male Shiba Inu to show.      So.. am I suddenly relegated to the land of "bad breeders" because we'll have 3 breeds in the house?        They'll all be shown, all but the Shiba will be worked, and all will - of course - be health tested for the issues prevalent in their breed.
20090225110427AArdrEC	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog act out of character when in certain circumstances?	Well im 15 and my older bro isnt in so im looking after the dog hes 9months old. My parents insist that i keep him in my room because for some reason he pees in the house even though we trained him not to do so. I was going down stairs and he ran out and saw my younger brother downstairs on the computer. When he was there when i tried to pick him up hed bark. He wouldnt bite hed just bark. But as soon as my younger brother left the room the barking stopped and he lay down in a submissive manner. When i took him up to the room he wouldnt stop licking my arms and ear.       So why did my dog act this way and was he licking me because he was sorry for barking at me?
20090225111019AAFBnmh	Pets;Dogs	Why does my dog bite things now when hes excited?	When my dog sees me when i come back from school hes understandably excited. Before he used to just lick me for like 10 mins straight he would just stop the lick me stop then lick me after that he would calm down. Now because he realises i dnt like it when he licks me repeatedly because i push him away he now bites anything near to him and growls not an agressive growl just a normal growl; hes 9 months old      Why is this does he bite things to control his excitment
20090225111505AAdXiub	Pets;Dogs	If you stare your dog in the eye and he doesnt react agressivley does that mean he recongnises you as alphadog?	Sometimes my dog just stares at me when he does i stare back and we stare at eachother for like a minute then he looks away do bes that show hes submissive towards me and notices that im pack leader. Also when he bites stuff in the house when i try to take it off him he holds onto if for a bit. But after i say Noo let go he does. Then when i put it to his mouth he just moves his face away does that mean he recognises me as the pack leader because hes obidient

20090225110701AAbHiA4	Pets;Other - Pets	What can i put in my ferrets outdoor cage to keep her warm and happy ?	Hi I have a year old ferret she has always lived outside with her old family but since i have had her (about 3weeks). She has got a big outdoors cage with a run attached to it but i wasn't going to put her out into it until the summer when i have got another ferret to keep her Company and its a bit warmer    But my family keeps Moaning at me because she wont use her litter tray and keeps going to Toilette behind my door and its ruining the floor and she smells quite a lot even though she has ferretdeodorantt. At night she makes a lot of nose as well and it stops me from sleeping.   So she has got to go outside in her hutch. She has a food bowl, water bottle, litter tray, food and dust free hay/straw as bedding, i filled the whole sleeping area to the top with it and added some of my dogs fluff (he is a keeshund so when we brush him we get loads of like wool). But i do not no what else she should have in there. She will still be in my room for about 7 hours a day when im home from school so she wont be in there all the time.    What would be good toys for her?   Is there any extra bedding i can add to keep her warmer?   Thanks  i really am worried about her going outside. x

20090226124524AAlFBfo	Pets;Dogs	Dog dislikes backyard, can't stay in house.?	I have an 8 month old female miniature dachshund. We have been crate training her for about 8 weeks now (she's a slow learner). This past weekend we moved from an apartment to a large house with a huge backyard and a nice covered patio area. We thought our dog Frankie would love it since we've never had a backyard. Well, she hates it. Every time we put her outside she just sits by the door and cries. I put her crate out on the patio, along with food, water, and toys so she would have some comforting familiar things out there, but she knocks over her food and water and doesn't play with the toys. There are two bushes and grass in the yard with a cinder block fence and that's it. I don't understand what she doesn't like. I felt bad for her on Tuesday so I left her inside while I was at work. She peed in two different spots and pooped in a corner. So I can't leave her inside because she STILL hasn't learned not to poo/pee in the house, but I feel bad leaving her outside because she cries and seems to hate it, and since we moved to a different area I can't leave her in the crate because I don't have time at lunch to drive over and let her out. AAAHHH!!!  So - #1) Is she just to 'slow' to understand crate training? It's been two months and she still doesn't seem to get it.   And #2) Will she ever get used to the backyard? Why do you think she hates being out there?
20090225111730AAbXDeN	Pets;Dogs	Can't Stop My Dogs From Fighting?	I have two indoor dogs.  One (dunno breed, looks like a 45 pound rottweiler) a little over 3 years old, one (pit bull) a little under 2.  Had both since they were tiny puppies.  Recently, a female dog was brought in.  Too young to be in heat, probably around 2 months old when she was brought in.  They began fighting about a month after that.       The older one has always been aggressive.  Can not let friends or anyone other than about 6 family members get around it, or it WILL try and bite them.  It and the pit bull have always gotten along, with it being dominant, and the pit bull being a baby and not minding.  The pit bull doesn't bite at people and is completely non-aggressive.      Now, the fighting used to happen occasionally, but now it's getting into life or death fights, with me not being able to phase them or break them up at 6'4" 230 pounds.  The older one/aggressive one always starts these fights.  He has been beating up on the pit, because the pit really is non-aggressive.  It's just now starting to fight back, and things are getting bloody.      They absolutely cannot be around each other anymore.  The last fight they got in was awful, the following day neither one moved out of their 'spots' all day (sore, depressed?).  Today is 2 days later, and I got around them both at the same time with some food.  I was making sure to feed the 'dominant/aggressive/older' dog first, and the pit bull really didn't care, he was wagging his tail.  But when I saw the other dog's tail, I could see something was going to go down.  He just started getting stiff and his tail went into a curl.       They can't be around each other.  What needs to be done?  The female has been put outside with another dog (these dogs rarely ever see them as they are inside dogs) and the fighting is worse now.      Need advice bad.

Do you think that she will get used to the fact of staying in the basement with her chew toys and blankets during the day and @ night and just getting about 5 hrs out to roam the house free or do you think it will just be horrible punishment to her and I should get rid of her ???? Keep in mind that Im also about to have a baby and Ive had this dog every since she was 3 months old and she has been my first and only pet !!!!

I know her stable blanket won't cause rubbing or discomfort because its so soft and she loves it. Should I just leave her in her non-water proof stable blanky for turnout and in the stall? They do not go out in rain or snow, so the only way it would get wet is by rolling, right?

Now this would be okay if grandpa could remember to wash the stuff out but he doesn't.  So my question is:      is there a safe homemade cleaner that won't hurt the horse if it gets left in the sheath or is there something we can buy that won't hurt the horse if it gets left in there?      thanks

I work in the same office as she does and she brings her dogs to work with her, and I hope to be able to bring my new puppy along with me to socialize with them. She has a young Maltese with a very calm nature about him, but he loves to play with her other puppy, a Papillon. The Papillon is a crazy little dog who loves to play, but she gets very tired often throughout the day and just wants to rest.      Would a Schipperke be a good friend to these two dogs, or should I be prepared to keep them separated?

I bought my two four month old kittens in yesterday, the female for a comprehensive exam and the male for umbilical hernia surgery (I know I shouldn't have bought them both in together). When I went to pick them up I discovered that they performed the surgery on the female cat, not the male!!! I was furious, they are telling me that low and behold she has a hernia too so it was a godsend. i dint believe it for one minute though. When I went to talk to them they acted so calm about it like they knew it already. They don't want to refund me or pay for the males surgery. Who can I complain too? Also what is an estimate of the cost for this type of surgery? The vet that messed this stuff up charges 1,400 dollars (we had bought a wellness plan from them so it only cost us an additional 250). I spoke to the vet that we are changing to today though and they gave us a VERY different estimate, without any wellness plans or anything they said it will be about 200 dollars. Which one of these is more accurate? $200 or $1,400

When I came home he had eaten most of the food and water and used the litter box.  Still, he looked very thin to me (and a little scared).  At first I thought he just missed me and that a day of love and attention would get him back to normal.  It's my 2nd day home and he's meowing a lot (he never meowed before) and his breathing seems to be heavy and shallow.  He's about 12 years old and an indoor cat.  Should I rush him to the vet in a panic or wait a day or 2 cuz maybe he's still freaked out that I was gone so long?  Which btw. . . I'm NEVER doing that again!  :^(

20090226130120AAoHE8a	Pets;Rodents	3 month old male rat making weird grunting noise?	ive had my 3 month old rat for about a month now.  he has a sensitive nose and sneezes whenever he's in a new place: outside, on the stairs, when i'm doing dishes.  i noticed his sneezing about 2 or 3 weeks ago, and nothing's changed.  no discharge, no clicking or wheezing, no laboured breathing, no change in behavior.  he's REALLY hyper, loves his food, and whenever i go to his cage to get him he's snoozing.  so i'm not too worried about his occasional sneezes.  on average it's about 3 times a day.  yesterday he didn't sneeze at all.  today he sneezed about 3 times, including a little sneezing fit of 3.  they're all dry sneezes, too, and his nose is hardly ever wet or runny.  and about 85% of the time the sneezes are just little sniffs. i've talked to a vet, a rat specialist, and brought him to his breeder's mom.  they all think i'm being hyper sensitive.   so anyway, he was sitting on my shoulder today, being really still, and all of a sudden he started doing this really weird grunting sound when he breathed?  it sounded "crunchy" almost- not sure how to describe it.  and i know it wasn't him grinding his teeth.  it sounded almost like a vocalization, but more along the rythm with his breathing.  and it was on-and-off.  it would last for about 2 seconds, would stop for about 30 seconds, and then he'd do it again.  and sometimes he'd only do it once.  i listened to his lungs, and they sounded fine.   by the way, he's living at a friend's down the street.  he just got a new friend that's being quarantined for about one more week, and another one that my friend owns thats quarantined in another room for possibility of respiratory infection.  her other rat lives above mine, and he's always been fine.  my rat's bedding consists of scraps of material that i wash about 2 or 3 times a week.  he was on carefresh, but since he sneezes i wanted to try something else.

A few months ago we were watching tv and suddenly she began convulsing and shaking. I took her to the vet, and they told me she looked fine for the time being but recommended blood work to rule out dog epilepsy. I opted out of the blood work to see if perhaps it was just a one time thing. Then last week it happened again. I definitely want to get the blood work done now and get her help. I there a pet insurance I can get that will cover these cost? I know most insurances wont cover preexisting conditions.But she hasn't been diagnosed yet.

20090226125603AAANFGe	Pets;Cats	Is it time to put my cat down?	I've got a cat that's 19 or 20 years old. I adopted her about 4 years ago.      She's lost all teeth but her canines and one tooth that is rotting (stinks). She can't completely  groom herself, she she does she vomits up a hairball, so I have to comb her with a flea brush.      She has arthritis and cant jump that far in the air (on a dining room chair is the highest it gets) and when she jumps down her butt hits the ground.      Every time she eats I mix her food with water so its like a soup, even then after eating she spends the next 10-20 minutes choking and gagging trying to keep her food down.      She gets nasal infections. I took her to the vet and they gave her antibiotics. That cleared it up for about 2 weeks after treatment then she immediately got another one. So she sneezes all the time. Another vet trip is planned soon for that.      She cant really scratch her claws on the carpet that much any more and it takes her forever to get up or down stairs.      Is she just getting old or is it time to consider putting her down? This is the first old cat I've had. I adopted her because someone was just going to get rid of her because she was inconvienent and I wanted to give her a good home until she passed on or was in to much discomfort to live.
