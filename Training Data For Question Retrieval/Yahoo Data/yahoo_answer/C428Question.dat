I thought that I could use plexiglass to cover the pictures to you could put stuff on top and it would be protected. But I'm not really sure how I can get the pictures to stick to the table without the pictures absorbing any glue. Also I'm not sure how to get the plexiglass to stick to the top.

Do you like my idea?	im a HUGE sucker for school spirit, and since ym old school and my new school both have Royal blue as one of their colors, i chose to use that as a theme in my room.       i want to frame silly pictures of me and my friends at cheerleading or doing funny stuff, but in black and white with just the blue showing.       then i want everything black or white, except one royal blue wall, and a few other few accents (door handle detailing, desktop, pillows, ect)       But i dont want plain royal blue, i want it to have a slight shimmer to it, like my silk hair ribbon. i want it a satiny-texture, do they sell that? i dont want glittery, i want shimmery, like a silk ribbon. if so, where can i buy that?

I just moved into a new apt. when i went in the apt the color of it was not good but it didn't look bad except for bleach stains which she warned me about. the managers dad used to live there and he smoked. well she said she shampooed the carpets before i moved in and when i saw them the carpet didnt smell cuz she had just cleaned them. well the next day when i was moving in the apt had a smell. i cleaned the carpets all weekend with black stuff coming up out of them. they still have a nasty moldy musty smell. i mentioned this to her and she seemed surprised that they smelled and she said they mite just tile the parts just out the bathroom where the smell is bad (i told her the smell was worse by the bathroom). the carpet is also really rough and doesn't feel like good carpet when u walk on it barefoot. she hasn't responded yet if for sure they will do the tile. but there is another apartment that is getting redone b/c the lady lived there for a long time. she said that u can move to a another apt but it would just cost like 50 bucks to move. i want to ask if i can move into that one b/c the carpet is new and what not, but i just moved not even a week ago. will they think im a bad tenant for making a big deal out of the nasty carpet? and should i just wait for her to see what she says about my current carpet or should i just ask to move to that newer apt.

The sofa I am interested in has been discontinued, so if I don't buy this one, I will never have another chance to own it.  I expected at least a 25% or more mark down, but the manager offered it to me at only a 12.5% discount.   Should I buy or insist on a better mark down?  What is a reasonable or standard markdown percentage in this situation.  NEED ANSWER ASAP!!!

Really all I need is one queen-sized flat sheet -- I don't need an entire set right now (the flat sheet is ripped, the rest of the sheets are in perfect condition).  I'm trying to save money but I do need a new flat sheet for my bed.  I spent $100 on the set I have right now, but as I said, I just neet a flat sheet.  The sheets I saw at Walmart were only 200 thread count, and they had a flat sheet for only $10, but I would like a little higher thread count than 200!

20090306213900AAjsIUF	Home & Garden;Do It Yourself (DIY)	Two-way mirror - need both sides lighted...how?	I understand the principle behind the two-way mirror. One room is lit, one is dark...the lit side shows a mirror and the dark side can see the lit side. So I need to have BOTH sides lit. I would like to install a two-way mirror in my office so I can work when there is down time and go out when a customer comes in the shop. But I need my office to be lit, too, so I can work. The shop is very well lit, but I know if the other side is lit, the mirror just acts as a window. So...could I put some kind of tinting film on the office side? Or is there a different product I could use that would serve the same purpose? Thanks.

20090306210017AAVVsZX	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Help! Really ugly rental house, need tips.?	The house I am renting is really ugly. My main problems are the living room and the kitchen.      The living room is a really weird shape, it's really small and has this giant ugly oil heater takes up one of the walls, and is a total eyesore. The carpet is a really gross brown and it's old and stained. There isn't even a window in the room so its always really dark and stuffy. The walls are an awful color and need painting badly.       The kitchen is huge but the benches only go along one wall and the sink takes up most of that space anyway. It's so big and white that it looks empty no matter how much stuff I put in it. The cupboards are also really old and tacky. Oh and the floor is gross.      I would just move but there's a bit of a rental crisis going on here, and this place is a perfect size, perfect price and a great neighborhood, so moving isn't really an option.      Does anyone have any tips on what I could do to spruce the place up a bit? What color rug should I get that would go well with brown carpet? How can I make the living room less stuffy and dark? Any advice at all would be greatly appreciated.       Thanks!
