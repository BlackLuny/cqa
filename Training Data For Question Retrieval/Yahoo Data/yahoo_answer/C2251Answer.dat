a0Q1x7jnaa	The R4 is actually an adapter for a Nintendo DS or DS Lite, that allows you to not only play ROMs but homebrew games, MP3s, eBooks, and even movies. Different products to the R4 include the DSTT, N5, R4 SDHC, and EDGE. Many of these products do the same thing, but some are better than others.<br>  <br>  As always, there are legal issues surrounding the R4, but it is possible to purchase and use them completely legally. For reference, take a look at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.NDS-Gear.com/legal.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.NDS-Gear.com/legal.shtml</a><br>  <br>  Remember to always buy your cards from a trusted and reliable source that tests your cards prior to shipping, because very few internet places actually follow-through on customer support!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|2fqXT9W6aa	It can play ROMs, homebrew, music and movies.

5N4tsjNiaa	hi,<br>  I hardly ever do anything with shards. But if you want to make use of them all you need to collect 10 of one colour shard in the underground (really common), transfer them to your bag (make sure you take ten of at least one colour) and take it to a lady in her house on route 212 (between Pastoria City and Hearthome City) the area she is in isn't the lush green bit closer to Hearthome City but the rainy, muddy bit closer to Pastoria City. She lives in a small house, just west of the water near the bridge. There is also a lady dressed in pink with an umbrella outside her house and when you go inside she is the one with blonde hair. She will give you 1 type of TM for each 10 of one colour shard you have collected in your bag, so there are only 4 possible  items you can receive from her and they all change the weather during battles.<br>  10 RED SHARDS will gain you SUNNY DAY<br>  10 BLUE SHARDS will gain you RAIN DANCE<br>  10 YELLOW SHARDS will gain you SANDSTORM<br>  10 GREEN SHARDS will gain you HAIL<br>  <br>  Hope this was helpful and sorry for writing a bit much!|`|zZ3BmCXoaa	They can be traded to a person on route 212 for certain TMs<br>  <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Shards" rel="nofollow">http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/S...</a>|`|59AZ4GKVaa	Hello fellow Pokemon trainer, here I am to answer your question & to hopefully get my points in return. The shards are found randomly in the UnderGround, & once you find them there, transfer them to your bag. Near Pastoria City, there is a house & in front of the house there is a Parasol Lady, anyways go inside. Inside there should be 2 girls, talk to the blonde girl ONLY if you have 10 shards of the same color. Well, here's what you get in the trade:<br>  <br>  -10 red shards/ Sunny Day<br>  -10 blue shards/ Rain Dance<br>  -10 yellow shards/ Sandstorm<br>  -10 green shards/ Hail<br>  <br>  Well, hope this helps you in your quest. Good luck & good bye!!

70aa0db8082ddead46f656ecb978193aaa	If two tanks of the different volumes hold the same pressure, then the larger one should be able to fire more shots.|`|R9XL1hs4aa	yes. im guessing you have a co2 with out a lil meter thing n the side. i have paintball gun with a co2(not the regular black ones with cold air) the more expensive ones have meters on the side saying how much pressure you have. meaning you can change the amount of pressure. but being that one co2 is bigger than the other one of course will be able to hold more than the other.<br>  and yes the bigger one will be able to fire more shots if its got more air. if you have 2 different sized tanks with the same amount of air then they are gonna fire close to the same amount. even if you had 2 exact same tanks that are maxed out they both arent gonna fire the same amount of shots because the amount of pressure in each shot is never exactly the same as the one before... make sense?

It is easy for either side to cheat the other.<br>  <br>  You could sell your account, get the money and contact Blizzard to have your password reset so you can get it back (rinse and repeat).  Just as you could sell your account and the buyer can register a complaint and get the transaction reversed.

c874b1d8eaaa56613f2d2ab359c1a965aa	Actually meaning of marble is mineral and so glass (silica) is also a mineral with which marbles are made|`|23e34c103ee75c18e407bcdd462ecac9aa	The word marble is derived from the German term "for the rock," and has come to mean any small, round sphere used as such. This made Germany the center of marble manufacturing for several centuries. Mills were grinding out versions from agate, limestone, brass, and gemstone, and these large operations could grind a marble into shape at the rate of about 800 an hour. <br>  <br>  Glass marbles, the most common version of the object today, only came into existence relatively recently in the history of the object. It is debated whether they originated in Venice, where glassblowing had become a well-developed industry since the ninth century, or back in Germany. Historians point to 1846 as the invention of marbelschere (marble scissors) by a glass factory employee in Germany. This tool resembled a pair of tongs with a small cup on one end and a slicing device on the other. <br>  Marble manufacturing migrated to American shores in the later decades of the 19th century. In 1900 Martin Frederick Christensen received a patent for a machine that made near-perfect spheres of steel ball bearings. The first machine-made marbles were manufactured in a barn behind Christensen's house in Ohio, which eventually led to a prosperous manufacturing facility. By 1910 the 33 workers at the M.F. Christensen and Son plant were producing 10,000 marbles a day. The furnaces were fired by natural gas, however, and the onset of World War I brought rationing of the resource and spelled the fiscal end of Christensen's operation.<br>  <br>  Akro Agate Company, founded in 1911 and originally based in Akron, Ohio, became the next major marble manufacturer. Further refinements in marble-making machinery came during the 1920s, and Akro Agate enjoyed a position as the major marble manufacturer during the subsequent decades. But the popularity of marbles as toys waned as more sophisticated gadgets entered the children's toy market. Many of the American marble manufacturing firms countered this by diversifying operations into industrial glass production, such as making automobile windshields.<br>  <br>  Today, marbles are still produced in record numbers, but most are made in Third World factories. One such operation, Vacor de Mexico, located in Guadalajara, produces about 12 million marbles a day, which are then shipped to 35 different countries.<br>  <br>  Modern marbles are made from a combination of sand, soda lime, silica, and several other ingredients added for pigment or decoration. These other additives range from aluminum hydrate to zinc oxide. The primary component, sand, is essentially loose, granular particles of disintegrated rock. Another compound used in marble manufacturing is silica, a white or colorless crystalline found in agate, flint, quartz, and other rocks. Some marbles are also made from cullet, or scrap glass.<br>  <br>  Good Question, I learned something today.|`|5822d46b952eab713611cab466ef3f49aa	they use to be made from marble now they are all made from glass.|`|5KvvFOSdaa	Marbles were originally made from clay or marble, hence their name.|`|AA11595245	Marbles were originally made from clay or marble, hence their name.<br>  Marbles are often mentioned in Roman literature, and there are many examples of marbles from ancient Egypt. They were commonly made of stone, metal, or glass until the 18th century, when ceramic marbles become more common.<br>  Ceramic marbles entered inexpensive mass production in the 1870s.<br>  Glass marbles entered mass production in the early 20th century, when World War I cut off their importation from Europe, causing American innovation to be applied to the task, producing a mechanized method of glass marble production which became the most common system in the world. Glass marbles, too, became the most popular variety, and have remained so to this day.<br>  In some developing countries children use steel balls as a less pricey marble substitute.

WuhIoS1laa	It might be your video card. <br>  <br>  The lower end video cards will have a problem displaying fish in tanks (for the base game) or ponds (if you have Seasons installed). <br>  <br>  There is a switch that might make them appear, but it affects how an older card displays other things, so use with caution.<br>  <br>  Open the cheat console with Ctrl + Shift + C and then type in:<br>  Boolprop useshaders true<br>  <br>  Your card's performance in the game may not respond well to the cheat code.  If things look worse, pull up the cheat console again and re-enter the code with 'false' instead of 'true'.<br>  <br>  I think there was something else related to this so I'll look some more and update.<br>  <br>  If it doesn't work, try first updating your video card drivers. If that doesn't help you may need a newer video card. If your card is that old, to be honest, you might want to consider upgrading the whole system.

Several versions of the game are available for specific countries or regions.In the game, players defend the "Maple World" from MONSTERS and develop their character's skills and abilities, as typical role.. Groups of players can ally together in "parties" to hunt monsters and share the rewards, or they can band together under a common name in a guild.A player engaging in the monster-fighting element of the gameplay.<br>  <br>  Characters in MapleStory advance by gaining experience points (EXP, like many other RPGs), leveling up, improving various skills and collecting various items and pieces of wieldable equipment. The players combat monsters, acquire play money called "Mesos" or "Meru" (depending on version) and various items, as well as completing quests.<br>  <br>  MapleStory characters exist in domains called "worlds" or "servers", e.g., "Scania" or "Aquila". Players are allowed to create up to three different characters in each world. Each world, similar in content between each other in the same version, is split into up to twenty channels, among which characters are allowed to switch. Characters and their items cannot be transferred between worlds, although there is limited functionality in transferring items between characters of the same world. Players can use facial expressions ingame.|`|4123cfec819787d7084da404591f79c6aa	The last time I played MapleStory was back when it was in beta, so I may not have everything correct, but I'll sure try.<br>  <br>  Yes, there is such a thing as a "bandit/sin."  It's basically a hybrid of both thief classes.  Instead of just putting points into dagger or throwing star skills, a bandit/assassin has the ability to use both types of skills, at the cost of only being mediocre at both (though there is some argument about this, last I heard).<br>  <br>  From what I understand, if you're trying to make a strong character, then this combination isn't exactly viable.  This is because of later class choices.  Though, my personal opinion is that, if a bandit/sin is something you want to do, then by all means, do it.<br>  <br>  Variety is the spice of life.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped a bit.

7d14e9a857a0fc42d98d504e0dfda213aa	Basic Rummy<br>  <br>  The game is best played with two to four players, but up to six can take part. Either a fixed number of deals are played, or the game is played to a target score. The number of deals or the target score needs to be agreed before beginning to play.<br>  The Deck<br>  <br>  One standard deck of 52 cards is used. Cards in each suit rank, from low to high:<br>  <br>      Ace 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 Jack Queen King<br>  <br>  The Deal<br>  <br>  The first dealer is chosen randomly, and the turn to deal alternates if there are two players, and rotates clockwise if there are more than two. In a two player game, each player is dealt a hand of ten cards. Seven cards each are dealt if there are three or four players, and when five or six play each player gets six cards. The cards are dealt one at a time, and after the deal, the next card is placed face up on the table to start the discard pile, and the remainder of the deck is placed face down beside it to form the stock. The players look at and sort their cards.<br>  Object of the Game<br>  <br>  The object of the game is to dispose of all the cards in your hand. There are three ways to get rid of cards: melding, laying off, and discarding.<br>  <br>      * Melding is taking a combination of cards from your hand, and placing it face up in front of you on the table, where it stays. There are two kinds of combination which can be melded: sequences (also known as runs) and groups (also known as sets or books).<br>            o a sequence or run consists of three or more cards of the same suit in consecutive order, such as club4, club5, club6 or heart8, heart9, heart10, heartJ.<br>            o a group, set or book is three or four cards of the same rank, such as diamond7, heart7, spade7. <br>      * Laying off is adding a card or cards from your hand to a meld already on the table. The cards added to a meld must make another valid meld. For example to the club4, club5, club6 you could add the club3 or the club7. You are not permitted to rearrange the melds in the process. For example, club2, heart2, diamond2, spade2 and spade3, spade4, spade5 have been melded, you are not permitted to move the spade2 from the group to the sequence, so as to lay off the spadeA.<br>      * Discarding is playing a card from your hand on top of the discard pile. You get rid of one card this way at the end of each turn. <br>  <br>  Play<br>  <br>  If there are two players, they take alternate turns starting with the non dealer. If there are more than two players, they take turns in clockwise rotation, beginning with the player to dealer's left.<br>  <br>  Each turn consists of the following parts:<br>  <br>     1. The Draw. You must begin by taking one card from either the top of the Stock pile or the top card on the discard pile, and adding it to your hand. The discard pile is face up, so you can see in advance what you are getting. The stock is face down, so if you choose to draw from the stock you do not see the card until after you have committed yourself to take it. If you draw from the stock, you add the card to your hand without showing it to the other players.<br>     2. Melding. If you have a valid group or sequence in your hand, you may lay one such combination face up on the table in front of you. You cannot meld more than one combination in a turn (but see House Rules). Melding is optional; you are not obliged to meld just because you can.<br>     3. Laying off. This is also optional. If you wish, you may add cards to groups or sequences previously melded by yourself or others. There is no limit to the number of cards a player may lay off in one turn.<br>     4. The Discard At the end of your turn, one card must be discarded from your hand and placed on top of the discard pile face up. If you began your turn by picking up the top card of the discard pile you are not allowed to end that turn by discarding the same card, leaving the pile unchanged - you must discard a different card. You may however pick up the discard on one turn and discard that same card at a later turn. If you draw a card from the stock, it can be discarded on the same turn if you wish. <br>  <br>  If the stock pile has run out and the next player does not want to take the discard, the discard pile is turned over, without shuffling, to form a new stock, and play continues - but see the variations section for a discussion of alternatives and problems that can arise.<br>  <br>  A player wins an individual hand by either melding, laying off, or discarding all of his or her cards. Getting rid of your last card in one of these ways is called going out. As soon as someone goes out, play ceases. There can be no further melding or laying off, even if the other players have valid combinations in their hands.<br>  Scoring<br>  <br>  When a player goes out, the other players add up the value of all the cards still remaining in their hands, as follows:<br>  <br>      * Face cards (K,Q,J) are worth 10 points each<br>      * Aces are worth 1 point each<br>      * Number Cards are worth their face value - for example a six is worth 6 points, a four is 4 points, and so on. <br>  <br>  The total value of all the cards in the hands of the other players is added to the winner's cumulative score.<br>  <br>  The game continues with further deals until a player reaches the points target that was decided before the game began, or until the agreed number of deals has been played.|`|332a5d7ed9823322da0c8c03289e67c5aa	One of my favorite card games!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pagat.com/rummy/rummy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pagat.com/rummy/rummy.html</a>

Nothing in the world is diffirent from another, we all are made of energy, so in theory you can alter anything you want. Take a spoon for example. Invision the metal turning into your flesh or bone and then will it to bend. You might actually bend it or it may take practice.

AA11385409	I'm not very sure (because their help section is not easy to navigate) but have you checked to make sure that your java is up to date?  Make sure you don't have a pop-up blocker turned on, because it won't let the games load, and sometimes you'll see it try to load but disappear (like when an ad tries to come up and gets zapped)<br>  If you want your pop-up blocker on when you access the games, hold down CTRL while you click with your mouse on the game link.  That should allow you to open whatever pop up window you are clicking on.<br>  Hope this helps!|`|AA11089376	Humm try going into setting and doing a cookie swep and add-on swep.

f5f14cdbafe07f37788fde008b6c0c73aa	Im letzten Sommer bin ich mit meinem Mann aus Neugier 3 mal in M?ckpomm auf kleinen Seen Kanu gefahren. Es war toll, das erste Mal auf einem See mit lauter Seerosen und durch einen herrlich engen Kanal, der wirkte, wie im Dschungel ... <br>  Das zweite Mal auf dem Gro?en P?litzsee. Ein heftiges Gewitter kam auf, wir mussten ordentlich paddeln, um nicht auf dem Wasser zu sein. Landeten an einem Inselchen an, und warteten im Regen den schlimmsten Teil ab, zurück gegen immense Wellen. Den n?chsten Tag war ich fertig. Dabei habe ich gelernt, dass man immer die ganze Strecke vor Augen haben sollte, und an die Str?mung denken muss. Dann haben wir uns eigene Schwimmwesten und Paddel gekauft, eine Wasserkarte und wasserdichte Hüllen, in der auch ein Handy auf dem Wasser schwimmt,  - ein tolles Gefühl! <br>  Das dritte Mal war ruhig mit sanfter Brise, einem sch?nen Sonnenuntergang und einem leckeren Bierchen dabei ... Romantisch.<br>  Gekentert sind wir noch nicht, aber unser Kanuratgeber sagt, dass es ganz wichtig ist, das Kentern einmal bewusst zu üben, um damit Erfahrung zu sammeln. Das werden wir vielleicht dieses Jahr testen! <br>  Ich glaube, ich kann an keiner Kanustation mehr vorbeifahren ... ich bin wirklich angefixt.

After you've beaten the Death Mountain dungeon, the next area you'll move into is the Lanayru province. A short time into the province, you'll fly in the clutches of a gigantic, twilit bird up the now-frozen Zora's River to the Zora's Domain, where you will find the source of the river is frozen solid as well. After fight some black enemies (I still can't find names for them) and opening a portal in Zora's Domain, Midna will mention that you need something to break the ice with. Warp to Death Mountain, check the huge rock, and warp back to Zora's Domain. This drops the rock into the ice, freeing the river and the Zoras, and allowing you to continue.<br>  Later on, don't forget to come back here with the Water Bombs and blow up the rock (yes, "blow it up") while it's underwater.

d1e11c6845d4b1484d74eed47ea81746aa	If im understanding your question right, each server is basically the same as far as content goes. Each server has the same bosses, instances, items. What might be the case in new servers is that certain doors, or events has to take place to be able to access those encounters. <br>  <br>  Now as far as the hardest boss, Domo in mc is hard in the sense no horde or alliance have killed him. Only cause he gives up, only to be one shotted by rag later. But in all honesty Illidan is rumored to be "unbeatable". But as of right now he is not accessible and expected to be on a content patch later. <br>  <br>  Not sure why you would want a server with the most people on it, but if you go to pick a server any server that says full and its not a prime time, would be a good guess. But if you were to go to a full server except to wait in a que to get into the game. There used to be a wow census website that had statistics on ratio's alliance/horde and how many people were on that server, but for the life of me can not remember the name of it.|`|1caa1b86327b5b7d7cf9bdd46af944d7aa	Illidan is the hardest boss in WoW right now not sure where he is though.

Dont give your info to anyone!|`|AA10837077	I presume you received an email saying you won.Look at the questions I have answered on this site in my info. There are so many winners there could not be enough money to pay them all.There is no International Lottery.This is a Nigeria scam. Yahoo/MSN, U.K. and Australian lotteries, football lotteries from the same counties, Global-Link, World Poverty, Microsoft, Free Lotto, which now seems to have it's own people answering gambling questions on this site claiming they have won which is a total lie, and hundreds more. I am a retired Police Officer that has years of experience investigating Internet scams and frauds. This is an old one. The common link to them getting your email is on line surveys. Yahoo does not give it's stock holders money away nor does it give it's email subscribers address's to lotteries. The only way to win in a lottery is to buy a ticket, if you didn't you could not possibly win. Here is the website of the 17 nation law enforcement task force that investigates cross border Internet crime. You may file a complaint there. www.econsumer.gov. Also go to www.ripoffreport.com and browse complaints and you will find many having the same doubts as yourself about these scams. Below is a typical scam and how they work it. They just go under a thousand different names. They are asking you to send a prepayment to collect your winnings and they want you to send it by a money wire service. Lotteries do not just pick your name out of thin air, and just so happen to have your email also. No Internet service provider gives their email list out to lotteries. If you did not pay to play you could not possibly win.<br>  <br>  recieved letter of winning $65000.00 Pacific Player International lotteries,please contact claims agent miss linda strong at 204-951-7582.

Er ist riesengro? und kommt ganz ohne aufregende Karussells aus, der Eintritt ist erschwinglich. Dafür gibt es jede Menge zu entdecken und Spa? für die kleinen und die gro?en: Giftgarten, Insektenwald, Gold waschen, Spiegelkabinett, Tretboot, Flo?, Wasserspielplatz, Edelsteinsuche und noch ganz viele Sachen mehr. ich wei? ja nicht wo du wohnst, aber ich war schon ein paar mal da und es lohnt sich immer wieder. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familienpark-sottrum.de/" rel="nofollow">http://www.familienpark-sottrum.de/</a>|`|kowoXSXLaa	Der Safaripark in Hodenhagen ist toll. Da fahrt ihr erst durch und schaut euch die Tiere an. Danach k?nnt ihr dann in den Freizeitpark gehen. Dort findet ihr viele Sachen die auch die Kleinen machen k?nnen. Vor allem ist der nicht so teuer wie z.B. Phantasialand.|`|lpUMrcLvaa	movie park is der geliste!!!|`|mixZmlpQaa	der europapark bei ruhst ist geil|`|sU53aUoPaa	hi ich kann dir schlo? beck empfehlen ist sehr sch?n für kleinere und der eintritt ist nicht so teuer. phantasialand finde ich zu teuer. wir haben auch zwei kinder von 4 und 1,6 jahren. schau mal im internet nach. meist gehen die kleinen in dem alter noch nicht auf alle bahnen, meine zumindestens nicht.|`|zLPrARuDaa	Gib im Internet doch mal in eine Suchmaschine "Freizeitpark" ein. Dort kannst du dir dann genau ansehen ob die Parks etwas für kleine Kinder ist. Also ich würde lieber noch ein bisschen warten, bis sie ?lter sind und lieber mit ihnen in eine Spiel und Spasshalle gehen. Ich glaube das ist eher was für die beiden. Oder vielleicht in einem Allwetterzoo.

bf21744950a0e70ac2f2fa2a6a3f0708aa	Adding graphics is pretty simple once you get the hang of it. <br>  <br>  First go to Start> All Programs> Stepmania> Open Stepmania Program Folder> Songs> The folder your song is in> Then your song. Okay now copy your graphics and paste them in this folder. <br>  <br>  Rename your graphics after what your song is called, for example, if my song name was "B4U" then I would rename my: <br>  <br>  - Banner "B4U-bn"<br>  <br>  - Background "B4U-bg"<br>  <br>  - CD title "B4U-cd"<br>  <br>  If you don't know already, CD titles are those little graphics that spin by the banner while selecting a song. Oh on a side note, be sure to toggle your "Fast Load" off in Stepmania, so the graphics will load guarantee. <br>  <br>  You can find that option by loading up Stepmania> Options> Other Options> Fast Load> toggle off.<br>  <br>  Well, good luck!|`|PfLaH6aDaa	Awesome, I haven't played Stepmania in AGESSSS! Anyway, all you really have to do is go to the All Music folder under the Stepmania folder, then go to the folder belonging to the song you want, then save the image you want under that song, and when you save it, make sure it's saved as the EXACT SAME name as your song.<br>  <br>  Good luck! :)

okzGiXTPaa	I hav a nintendo light its gr8 i luv it and hav become addicted 2 animal crossing ive neva had a dsi but i know the light is reliable and really  gd hope this helps|`|uAMUG0xaaa	Hell's yeah! You can take pictures with it, morph and mess with<br>  the pictures, I think even record video's with it but not sure...There's<br>  even a SD card slot, so you can put them on your computer :D<br>  Unfortunately, the only downside is that there is no GBA slot for GBA<br>  games, transferring pokemon into Diamond and Pearl from GBA pokemon<br>  games, or playing the DS guitar hero games...that's why I'm going to <br>  keep my DS lite and buy a DSi. So basically I'm cheating, but the DSi<br>  is awesome! So if you don't already have a DS lite, forget it and buy<br>  the DSi, I think it ships in april.|`|iqJWCfQIaa	The DSi should be the better of the two, since it is newer. The Lite is very buggy...but I've never used the DSi. <br>  <br>  If money is no object, you should consider purchasing a Sony PlayStation Portable. It's the best handheld availiable.|`|dUnDqrmtaa	I would get a dsi but your choice.. because i have a ds and i never play it<br>  <br>  this website has the diifrents......|`|T3DLgs6Vaa	Get the DSI.  Anything that is newer is better.  You can get more info from nintendo.com or even youtube.  I will Be getting my DSI, I've sold my ds lite already.|`|FQdE11IBaa	DSI:<br>  An SD card slot hides behind the cover on the right-side of the handheld. The SD card can be used for external storage of pictures, downloaded software and to play AAC audio. The built-in audio player feature can adjust pitch and playback of AAC audio and does not support MP3s.Photos taken using the DSi can be synced to the Wii's Photo Channel.<br>  <br>  Similar to its competitor, the PlayStation Portable, and Nintendo's own Wii console, the DSi has upgradable firmware; a first for a Nintendo handheld system. All existing homebrew flash cards for the Nintendo DS and DS Lite are incompatible with the DSi,but cards that can run DS software on a DSi are now being produced – the first one was created by Acekard.<br>  <br>  Nintendo has reported that the DSi uses region locking for DSi-specific software, since the handheld provides Internet services tailored individually for each region and it uses rating-based parental controls, which differ by country. However, certain elements are region-free: Internet browsing, photo sharing and Nintendo DS software.The WPA and WPA2 support is not backward compatible with original DS games. Only DSi services can use WPA.<br>  <br>  <br>  DS Lite:<br>  Capable of receiving Wi-Fi signals from other Nintendo DS Lite systems, the original Nintendo DS, Nintendo's Wii, and Wi-Fi access points. WEP encrypted and unencrypted networks are supported. WPA encryption is not supported<br>  <br>  In my opinion; I would get a DSi, BUT if you want a DS lite I would advise waiting until the DSi comes out when they will certainly drop in price :-)

c5W2Q6qKaa	Hack it.|`|eqpNVeU7aa	loads of ways, depending on how much you think is a lot, try merchanting if you are high level and experienced, i earn loads from that and i quit ages ago, i just go on and update every so often.<br>  but low level i would suggest mining pure ess [members] or rune ess [free] for cash, decent enough.<br>  and finally if you don't fit into any of those, or need money for the higher level one, i hunted, once you get 70-ish the red chins are AWESOME! also you could try that rune-crafting mini game, the great orb project, but you get tokens that you can use to buy ess, and its 1 ess = 1 token. you can get 600 average per game or a 50/50 game, where you win 4 of the rounds each cos you agree with the other team. to find 5050 just type "need 50/50 game!" or "join my/____'s chat for 5050!" then in the chat you agree a world, but just find a few and you will learn!<br>  <br>  good luck.<br>  <br>  oh, and i got a youtube, i [used to] make runescape videos and stuff, i still do tutorials every so often, my youtube is:    wriggzy<br>  soon ima mke a money-making guide video so stay tuned and sub if you wna!!!|`|JaK8P9Xbaa	first go around and kill as many goblins or other creatures that you can. the sell all of the stuff on them. or, you could go cut down trees and sell the wood, if you want to add me to your frerinds, i'll give some oney to help. im Pigslayer52.|`|Z2uTmAVbaa	Hack it with cheat engine 5.2 u can downlode it in google and add me sageth king
s0PKOSijaa	Play well, that's all. Though, BOMB and BASE missions present the best opportunities to earna  lot of points in a match, Rescue missions as well. But be sure that once you level up you earn at least 1 point every time you play a match. If you earn no points in a match, you will drop down a level.<br>  <br>  You just have to keep playing, and enjoy it. After all, the level is just a number.

7CjFvTMoaa	All you can do is appeal the ban (and that' only if your IP hasn't been blocked for something serious).  Since the appeal probably won't amount to anything and certainly won't change your status anytime soon, you should start from scratch and play by the rules this time (which includes not asking anyone to hack your old account).|`|Wnx8ZsXKaa	you cant get your stuff back.<br>  <br>  everything is frozen, your items arent gone, but there is not way of getting them back.<br>  <br>  create a new one and the play on<br>  <a href="http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=343053" rel="nofollow">http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=34...</a><br>  <br>  you can receive gaia cash cards in about 30 minutes <br>  then sell items in the marketplace (using the gaia cash to buy gaia cash shop items) and get whatever item you want.<br>  <br>  I bought an angelic halo of someone. that is how rich you can get.|`|XX0ac9iRaa	If you have been banned then the chances are they didn't just block your character but they deleted them as well. Your stuff is probably long gone... and they may have even blocked your IP address from your computer so you cannot create another account (depending on how bad your offence was). Sorry... the game is allowed to ban users for breaking their terms of use at any time, you'll just have to accept that.

DaAJrdyLaa	I'm not sure, but I frequently write things like that for video games I'm making.<br>  <br>  If he is starting to design a video game (which isn't all that uncommon) he probably doesn't want anyone to see it yet.|`|PNfjbSQMaa	well no game requires it, but there could be some reasons, for one he could be making a machinima, (machine based cinema) when i write one i always have a list of wepons being use and how many there are, (but i still suggest you keep your head down)<br>  <br>  another is if he has an amature MLG team, (major leage gaming) which isnt hard seeing how all you have to do it sign up and you get one, any good leader would have to know what wepons, where they are, and how many of them there are on each map, its a very serious thing.

XX0ac9iRaa	I had problems with the game freezing too, it got a lot better after I burnt the game to my hard drive. Have you tried that? Also, games crashing a lot can be a sign of the Xbox overheating, but if it crashes after just a few minutes of gameplay then that's probably not an issue.<br>  And your Xbox model shouldn't affect it at all: it runs just fine on my Xbox360 premium, and my friend has an Arcade and it's never had any issues.<br>  I've heard a lot of people have problems with Fallout freezing. The processing power required to play such a vast game means that it does occasionally have some hitches (unfortunately).|`|FDt7cC8haa	Microsoft has enabled games to be copied to the hard drive and can be played from there....You do need each game disc to play each game installed....Try to install your game to the hard drive...If you can't rent it....install it...and return it...Put your game disc in the tray and play the game off the hard drive...you will have no problems...If you do...contact Microsoft...there are no reason why a game installed on the HD should freeze, expect for having a bad hard drive...
AA10595247	Click on your active sim and you will see an option for Inteen. Click on that option to spawn the biological clock (looks like the red alarm clock that comes with the game, only it's blue). The clock will spawn somewhere close to your sim. The biological clock is your Inteen controller.<br>  <br>  Be sure to read the documentation that comes with Inteenimator because there is a lot of useful information.

vStM04Usaa	Both. Melee has a competitve edge Brawl doesnt seem to have. Brawl has much different gameplay, that some like some dont, but adds charcters modes stages and graphics. Brawl almost doesnt feel like a squel as much as a completely different game, but with the same goal. But a problem i see with Brawl i see is, with lots of practice, you still wont be much better than the competition. Because things were soo evened out and advaced tactics removed. Brawl is a half-welcome change, but wont replace Melee.|`|7taM1QMKaa	I personally liked the characters on melee better, because I've never heard of half the guys on brawl (meta knight, pit, Ike, etc.)<br>  But overall, with the story mode,new stages, online play, stage builder, and unlockables, I think Brawl is much better than melee.|`|1a5640e26354179042d08ff04e2de5c1aa	wii>brawl|`|9nQpqWhXaa	Super Smash bros.brawl.tons better|`|AA11322563	Brawl Hands down.<br>  <br>  It makes melee look like a parody game.|`|EN8IrMChaa	I wasnt sure at the beggining because i tought melee had more characters but it was just my imagination and lucario is like mewtwo, Ike is like Roy, toon link is like young link, etc.<br>  So i think Brawl is better, i also liked that brawl still have some maps that i loved just like melee like Hyrule temple or Corneria which are my favorites, i still miss some melee stages but if you compare melee with brawl, Brawl has lots of improvements, its so much better.|`|1YyV3pE4aa	Brawl by far....better gameplay, new maps, more characters and a great adventure mode!|`|5JQQVpoqaa	i loved melee and i cant wait till i get brawl|`|KUOfPB4laa	post your stuff on the SSBB forum|`|T1GBdC11aa	I think that brawl is has more options and characters. But the controls are a lot different on brawl then melee. Like Mario is supposed to do a spin when you press down and B on melee. In brawl that takes out F.L.U.D.D. I found that to be its weakest point how the controls changed a lot because I used to play melee a lot and I got used to the controls. But I still recommend brawl.|`|ZfLqFYiHaa	Super Smash Bros.

The console's best-selling game for 2005, Call of Duty 2, sold over a million copies.[53] Five other games sold as well in the console's first year in the market: Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter,[54] The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion,[55] Dead or Alive 4,[56] Saints Row,[57] and Gears of War.[58] Gears of War would become the best-selling game of the console with 3 million units,[59] before being surpassed in 2007 by Halo 3, with 8.1 million units.|`|uctxzjIIaa	Probably none. Micrsoft owned them during the time Bungie made the games, and therefore would be the one getting all the money.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	Multi-millions!!!! Halo is a money magnet and almost anything Halo related gets about a million each. Bungie appoproves many Halo products (from books to clothes) and that just keeps on bringing in the moo-lah|`|UuDmX9HTaa	I will have to say that they make a %#*& load of money.  >: /<br>  <br>  so holla at yo boi deauntreqman@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  you heard it from me so holla.<br>  <br>  <br>  my x-box live is XDnoobSlayer so add me or send message.|`|Vb92NEJtaa	lets just say they could give five dollers to everyone in ireland and they would still have more money than id ever see in my entre life
uSrRRy5Caa	I use Pirate Bay pretty often. The games I download work 90% of the time, but it just depends on your operating system, really. Usually I read the comments to see if there are any viruses or other nasty stuff in the torrent. But most of the time downloads are clean.|`|2fqXT9W6aa	Yeah, everything I've downloaded off there has worked. Pretty much everything on there will work.
DaAJrdyLaa	Sounds a lot like final fantasy 1.<br>  (You Create 4 Characters .One is blue, one red, yellow, green.

363NGjvHaa	Well I've found that the loading times are faster on the elite than on the normal Xbox 360, especially on Mass Effect. It does have a bigger hard drive. I think up to 120gb? And it is black (my friends call it "Teh ****** Bocks"). But the better graphics thing is absolute crap.|`|ZXkmsCT4aa	Nope Your wrong. Only the bottom one is right.<br>  <br>  Chrome Black Finish.<br>  <br>  Rest doesn't matter, its normal xbox.|`|QjzdGDxIaa	120gb HD<br>  Black finish<br>  Comes with HDMI cable|`|waSQ2So0aa	Its exactly the same the grapics r not better ,its just black ?????????<br>  and has a bigger HD
QzD3rJtMaa	If you collect rocks that look like celebrities, then you are a major nerd.  lol.<br>  <br>  Also if you collect a bunch of Star Wars toys.  I actually do that so I'm a huge nerd and am proud of it.  :-P  I actually have real Lightsabers.  I have Anakin's and Darth Vader's.  They cost me about $150 each, but are awesome.  I really want Darth Maul's double-sided Lightsaber, but that costs like $300.  Ooooo.  And Mace Windu's as I love the Purple Lightsaber.  :-D|`|aYoscopKaa	Starring at a computer all day.<br>  <br>  Too many video games.<br>  <br>  Over exsessive  amounts of reading<br>  <br>  Fixing computers<br>  <br>  Anything that requires some form of intelligence :)<br>  <br>  Nerds ftwww :)|`|MUqfdj63aa	playing video games allllll day|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Aimlessly ramming around on a snowmobile, atv or jet ski all damn day!|`|UtBb83Aeaa	Why? Are you concerned about looking like a nerd if you have a hobby that's regarded as nerdy? Really, you should not worry so much about what others think. If you enjoy your hobby, that's all that matters.

363NGjvHaa	Far Cry 2 is worth like ￡40 ($60) at least. I've never played Sonic Ultimate Genesis Collection but Sonic is usually good. and Dark Sector is very fun.<br>  For $70 I would say it's definitely worth it.
IUQjiNRmaa	Oh, I am so sorry to hear that. The answer is no. The game mentions that if you delete the game, you can't get it back.<br>  <br>  Well just start over and have fun knowing where all the secrets are.<br>  <br>  ?Hope this helps|`|HVu5YGQuaa	I don't think you can|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Unless you were using a backup device for it, that save is gone and she has to start over.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry!|`|Xd47RVjPaa	Sorry she can't.

Why do you think it's<br>  called "Delete"?
gBSxCUWIaa	City of Heroes hands down.  You essentially get 2 games for the price on one (heroes and villains) and SWG passed it's prime a long, long time ago.  <br>  <br>  CoH continues to innovate as well.  They just added the "Day Jobs" feature which is pretty awesome.  Here's an article about it:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.brighthub.com/video-games/mmo/articles/26955.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.brighthub.com/video-games/mmo...</a>|`|rUbnCCDhaa	I've only played coh so i'd have to say that one is better.|`|Xj1l4vRJaa	Well; if you're just getting into MMO's start with CoH, it's spectacular for beginners or those who won't have a whole LOT of time to dedicate.<br>  <br>  Star Wars Galaxies is pretty broken at this point. Back when the original developers were in charge, it was excellent, but it's gone through so many severe reinventions and dillutions, that it's just not any good anymore. It doesn't feel like star wars, it feels like a bad fan convention, the era they chose should not have hundreds of thousands of jedi, it should have *maybe* two to an entire server, they were that rare, but instead they're running around in an era to which they don't belong. The mechanics are poor at best, and the interface is conveluted.<br>  <br>  CoH is straightforward, has decent graphics, a fun mechanic, the missions FEEL like something out of a comic (10 points for authenticity), and you really feel a bond to YOUR character, since he or she feels completely unique to everyone else's.<br>  <br>  Trust me, Heroes\Villains is a better buy.
ZVx3BWEdaa	Your best bet would be to look up gaming stores near where you live and give them a call to see if they have the game and if it is used what their policy is for returning the game if it doesn't work. You can also ask them to start the game on one of their systems in the store to make sure it works before you buy the game used. If you don't want to take that kind of a chance with a used game then buy it new.You can look online at different retail stores to see if they have it in stock and if not you can call and see how long it will take for them to get it in. A lot of times they will call to their other stores to see if they have it there and ask them to hold it for you at the counter so you can go and pick it up. In some instances they will ask them to ship it to the store you went to so you don't have to do anymore traveling and that can take about 3 days or so. I hope this helps you out.Good luck on your search.<br>  <br>  Mags|`|vAoZOCCcaa	Why don't you try EBAY?

0mT4Rinraa	Dooku became a Sith only because he believed the republic was corrupt and the Jedi had become common soldiers. In one of the Star Wars books he actually meets with Yoda to try and work out a peace treaty. In truth, Dooku left the order to try and do good, but he was lured by the dark side. But he still believes that what he is doing is right, and he is sometimes horrified at the things his master (Darth Sidious) does.|`|2GNFQPdmaa	Easy. George Lucas doesn't care about characters that make sense, or good movies, or dialogue that sounds real. He only cares about getting his Vision down on film.|`|hBJM5JmEaa	You have to play the part in order to deceive another. It is a true art being a double agent.|`|ZZZ3jU7maa	he told obi won his plans to tease him because he didn't expect him to escape from the electric thing and when jengo fett's head was chopped off I think he flinched because Jango was his best bounty hunter and he didn't expect his death - it also showed a turning point when the Jedi's began to win.
