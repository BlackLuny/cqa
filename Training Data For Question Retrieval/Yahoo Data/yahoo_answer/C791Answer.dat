I think I am thankful I am not a guest.  Just serve the applesauce with a bit of cinnamon and the carrots toss out.  I cannot stand them and they always put them into everything to fill the product up because they are so cheap.|`|Z4QbQt3Xaa	Apple sauce can be used in muffins instead of oil or fat.<br>  Carrots can also be used to make carrot cake or muffins.<br>  You can also chop them up to add fibre to spaghetti sauce.<br>  Carrots also make a nice soup if pureed with ginger.|`|AUD1wZ5Kaa	Oh, oh, oh! If you're making bread, you can use APPLE SAUCE instead of butter. It gives you an applish flavor, and sometimes a tad bit cinnamon. For cooked carrots, you can use them in a Chinese dish. Or mash-up the carrots and make a kind of broth.|`|zbPNN4Ndaa	Carrot cake and applesauce cake.
pMFLqU0Yaa	Like this? Or was it something different? <br>  <br>    *  16 ounces tempeh<br>      * 1/4 cup sweet pickle relish<br>      * 1/4 cup finely chopped celery<br>      * 1/4 cup finely chopped red onion<br>      * 1/4 cup finely diced red bell pepper<br>      * 1/4 cup raw sunflower seed<br>      * 1/4 cup finely diced green pepper<br>      * 1/4 cup scallion, sliced into little rings, only the white and very light parts<br>      * 2 tablespoons tamari<br>      * 2 tablespoons finely chopped flat-leaf Italian parsley<br>      * 2 tablespoons lemon juice<br>      * 1/2 teaspoon finely minced fresh garlic<br>      * 1 teaspoon ground cumin<br>      * 1 teaspoon dry dill weed<br>      * 1 cup nayonnaise<br>  <br>  Prepare the tempeh first breaking it into chunks and steaming it over boiling water for about 15 minutes.  Set aside and allow to cool.<br>  <br>  Assemble the rest of the ingredients in a large bowl adjusting the amounts according to your preference.  Finely crumble the cooled tempeh into the bowl and combine with the chopped vegetables.  Add the nayonnaise last. Chill before serving.<br>  <br>  Serve as a sandwich spread – hearty wheat bread is nice, or serve as a dip with organic stone ground tortilla chips.

The use of honey rather than sugar is a plus. When next in your grocery store and your in the isle where all the honey is, look very closely at the different flavors the bees make.

U0KCmsKXaa	I agree with you.  I personally don't drink, except occasionally for something special like a wedding or holiday -- but even then it's usually only a glass of wine which I rarely finish.  Alcohol just doesn't do anything for me.  It's expensive and I have yet to find a drink that I like the taste of.  Like you, I don't have a problem with other people drinking as long as it's not to get falling down stupid drunk at some keg party.  That's just ignorant.|`|1dHTr3rkaa	Yes, I drink, but I don't like to get drunk.  If I feel a buzz coming on, then I just stop.  I'm a vodka girl .  I have a son and I want to live, and do not wish to kill anyone.  <br>  <br>  Drink responsibly!<br>  Cheers!|`|ksoMldqYaa	Oh yeah, I love my drinks.  I completely agree there's nothing wrong with a casual drink.  I have a pre-dinner drink 3-4 nights a week, I don't get drunk, just enough to relax me a bit.  And I never ever drive!  I really enjoy it and look forward to it but I know when to quit.  As a matter of fact now that we are trying to conceive I skip the drinks altogether the two weeks before my period in case I am pregnant and don't resume until I get my period, sorry if tmi!  Enjoy your drinks, tonight I am having stawberry limeade spiked with rum.|`|q8N1KZgoaa	I didn't start drinking until 22, (im 23 now) and even now I only have a bottle of wine every month.<br>  <br>  I don't like spending so much money on drinks...It seems wasteful to me.<br>  <br>  I guess I enjoy the relaxed feeling when drunk...Normally I will just stay at home and have my bottle of wine.  If a friend wants to show up I am fine with that as well...|`|uDOVf2vvaa	I agree with you. I think that you said it perfectly. If you don't over do it, don't put anyone else in danger and you are old enough, I do not think there is a problem with it.|`|mBfvthNaaa	No, been there, done that.  I don't see anything wrong with an occasional drink.|`|UZsBTupQaa	As long as you maintain control over your drinking, you're fine.  I agree with the person who said moderation is key.  But I also think that it can't be reduced to an amount or frequency, but really whether or not you have control over it.  Can you drink without feeling a NEED to drink, or to drink a certain amount?  Can you only drink a little if you want to?  Can you drink without repercussions after the fact?  These are the important questions.|`|HqDbcmZKaa	Yes I love to drink alcohol. I do get drunk (technically) but that is a chemistry thing as I am still in control and a good reasonable person. Drinking, not drinking alcohol, is good either way it is just another choice in life. We know that most people that drink alcohol are good reasonable people.<br>  If you can not handle something you should not take it. What I mean is if you have a bad reaction to peanuts you would not eat them right? So the same applies to other things such as alcohol.|`|U52N2rq3aa	ok well first off i don't want any stupid comments about ruining my life. I'm 15 almost 16 and in the uk (so drinking age is 18). The only times i drink is at parties, anoccasionallyly with the family on special occasions (the latter is really only a shandy or champagne etc). However, i am a bit of a lightweight and do tend to make a bit of a fool outta myself at parties, but the main reason why i do like drinking is because it makes me more confident. Normally i am quite reserved, not exactly shy, but not the most outgoing person; so drinking allows me to socialize with many people that wouldn't normally.|`|6SqxGQsqaa	im not a big old addict, but i LOOOVE getting drunk.  im no party animal either.  i just love sitting at home and getting wasted. it may sound pretty sick, but i dont do it all the time. its more like once a month.  theres nothing wrong with people that dont drink or just casually drink, their livers are way more healthier...|`|nlIpKw8Paa	yes i try to get wasted every day and i don't see any thing wrong with that cause i don't drive and do do anything wrong when im wasted the only thing im doing wrong is drinking under age.|`|lwccQoEZaa	Yes but as with anything moderation is the key!!  I drink for the same reason anyone does.. to chill {and I like the taste of the things I drink}|`|SEt1Znktaa	i actually prefer smoking pot cuz u dont get a hangover the next morning. but drinking is still chill.|`|QPePiRHFaa	just like any other drug|`|lFznJ1gnaa	I don't know of any good reason to drink. Not a single good thing comes of it.  and before anyone starts giving the thumbs down, ask yourself:  how has my life improved from even the occasional drink?  has anything bad ever happened to me or those around me due to alcohol consumption?  even in moderation?
18d121d01c136ac0f12ff28e4139c812aa	nothing on google and I don't have the book, sorry.
Q5BM2POnaa	Tried it thousands of times.<br>  <br>  I will tell you that 99% of the people who claim to not like tequila simply haven't had GOOD tequila.<br>  <br>  To get the correct tequila experience, don't drink anything that doesn't say 100% agave (like junk like regular Cuervo or Sauza). These are cheap poorly made tequilas designed to sell to college kids to get drunk. They are only 51% real tequila, and the rest are fillers like corn syrup and grain alcohol (and thus the hangover the next day is born).<br>  <br>  The aging has a lot to do with the taste, so try a few to see which style you like best, and then remember how the aging is labeled:<br>  <br>  Blanco (because it's totally clear) sometimes called silver - no aging<br>  Reposado - minimally aged at least 2 months, but can be up to 1 year, sometimes called gold<br>  Anejo - heavily aged, minimally 1 year but less than 3 years.<br>  <br>  The really expensive ones can even be aged longer than regular anejos, and these are often referred to as ultra anejos.<br>  <br>  Also consider how you're going to drink it:<br>  <br>  Slammed shots - go for a blanco. Anything else is a waste of flavor and $$<br>  <br>  Sipped shots (how I recommend it) - go for anejo only, or maybe a higher end repo and savor with no salt and a squeeze of lime. Chilled or on the rocks is good as is straight.<br>  <br>  Margarita - anejo is a waste, especially if the place isn't using fresh squeezed lime juice. Go for blanco or reposado.<br>  <br>  Salt is a gringo invention for the most part.  If you have good tequila a squeeze of lime can be nice, but skip the salt.<br>  <br>  If you want to try a good tequila, try one of the following:<br>  <br>  Cazadores <br>  Herradura<br>  Don Julio<br>  Corzo (please note this is not Cuervo)<br>  Pura Sangre<br>  Centinela<br>  Cabo Wabo<br>  Arette<br>  Dos Lunas<br>  <br>  If you still find it "disgusting" after trying one or more of these, then tequila is not for you.|`|axxQzOCHaa	After you have good tequila (Cazadores, Don Julio, Herradura, Espolon) you will wonder why you ever did shots of the rotgut brands such as Jose Cuervo, El Jimador, Cien Anos|`|q22ngVmkaa	Yes. It's good stuff when you get the salt and lime combo working. If you don't like it straight, try it in a margarita.|`|ciqP46b9aa	All alcohol is disgusting really thats why people try to hide the taste of it with so much stuff. Tequila slammer: lick the back of your hand pour a pinch of salt on there hold the lime, now lick the salt and without swallowing it take a shot of tequila swallow and immedialty suck the lime.<br>  its makes bad tequila bearable. A good drink with tequila is juice of half a lime dash of angostoura bitters shot of tequila and top up with ginger ale.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	Lick salt, take the shot, bite into the lime. It's like a margarita on your hand.<br>  <br>  What kind of tequila did you have? Good tequila is amazing, but bad tequila will mess you up and tastes awful.|`|Wrn6WH7xaa	I agree.<br>  <br>  You lick salf, take a tequila shot, and them suck on a lime. I've heard it doesn't help.<br>  <br>  Doesn't it kind of taste how nail polish remover smells?|`|ymm0mwPiaa	Probably you are trying cheap tequila!!!. The procedure already has been described: Lick the salt, drink the tequila and bite  the lime. The best tequilas I've already tried are: "Cazadores", "Don Julio" and "Patron", they are very tasteful and you don't get the headache next day because they are pretty good. Also remember to use shot glasses. I heard there are a lot of good and expensive tequilas as "Tesoro" and "Casa Noble" and so on, but I haven't tried them yet.|`|ax06tFUXaa	yes, I've tried Tequila...and yes it can be disgusting! Its an acquired taste if you ask me. well..you ask about the salt, tequila and lime thing?<br>  Well..you have a shot glass of Tequila, you have a slice of lime, and a salt shaker.  You take the  slice of lime rub it between your thumb, and pointer finger(like the side area of your hand) shake  salt on damp lime area on your side hand ...you then take the whole shot of tequila, lick the salt and suck on the lime All At Once..."Do this fast"...and there you have it....A Shoot Of Tequila. this is how this works.<br>  and How does it go? ....well....if you have to many of these shots...you will be Drunk as a Skunk,  and have a Headache that you wish you had never done it! and you feel like Crap! <br>  Have I had this happen to me...Yes! i didn't know how Tequila could make you feel like this!  Have I done it again and got drunk...No!!!...but I like a Good Margarita Every now an then, I am not going to lie to you.<br>  <br>  If your under Age Don't Drink....Wait till you Of Age!! and Be Careful!! <br>   I don't agree at all with Under Age Drinking..and I don't argree with Adults who Drink and Drive, and Friends who let Them!!  and Adults  who Get Drunk! Bad Behavior leads to Bad Judgement, and you pay for it in the End!!|`|3VSZsXJ1aa	lick your hand or put some lime juice on your hand so the salt could stick<br>  Then you lick it, take a shot and suck the lime... I really hate tequila, its the only thing that wrecks my night everytime, try rum or whiskey shots they taste better... especially bacardi spiced rum... i could drink that stuff by the bucket|`|6IT3WTppaa	if its cheap tequila you should mix it or use the salt lime nonsense. i like it striaght. try some top shelf like patron, milagro, 100 agnos. jinotepe is ok straight|`|MtXwlsJgaa	Yup as above or just do the shot chase with a sip O beer.
N2hMFrlYaa	apparently, according to my brother (who did extensive research as an impoverished student.... sherry has the highest % / price ratio, and by happy coincidence, for some reason sherry affects you much quicker.<br>  <br>  Whether it tastes nice is another question entirely, but it is much improved if it is chilled in the fridge.|`|TKDi70uTaa	dear me, you want to get off your nut the local alkies seem to prefer that white lightening cider.|`|m1cEbzBcaa	rum, gin, brandy, whiskey... all have simmilar alcohol content, so they will have the same quickness, but will be a change of pace.|`|QmnFlZuYaa	If your looking for a quick effect thats the quickest way to damage your liver. boring I know but quick effect means straight to the liver. Ive been drinking 5% cans for a very long time and had a liver test at my doctors which showed a small abnormality, stopped drinking for 3 weeks and it was gone. Probably different with shorts. Try 5% lager.|`|fzDqXTPDaa	Mouthwash.|`|ebhZ2OsQaa	Frosty Jacks - Urghhhhh.
uq4ZuWnEaa	French Fries or chips whatever one calls them it really does not matter, I am British and I assure you that not everyone eats chips every day in Britain.   I bought my children up with chips on average of 5 times a year and in the last 5 years I have cooked them 4 times.  Simply because my son-in-law loves chips.  What you Americans call Wedges is something that I have been cooking for years and certainly long before your wedges were introduced to Britain.  Anyway there is no certainty that it was not the French that first thought of frying the potato in the fashion of chips as originally the potato was eaten raw|`|ZTc7rE1Haa	Chips is the correct name for them in the English language. If Americans choose to call them fries, then that is their problem. Some people in the UK eat chips, but I rarely eat them, and never at home. I will occasionally choose to eat them as a treat. It's ironic that you point out that you think we eat a lot of chips in the UK when people in the USA live on them. That's all there seems to be - McDaaaaaaanolds and their 'fries with everything' menu which, sadly, has spread to almost every other country. We have the most amazing traditional recipes in the UK but bigoted people choose to ignore that. I don't think that Americans have any room to speak about our cuisine when all there is there are burgers and fried chicken.|`|ec38f4feb12dd01422eeeeb1fa7ed784aa	They are called chips because the potato is chipped into pieces. As for French Fries that is an American invention, in Europe they are called    Frites and they come from Belgium not France, In the UK the blood pudding is called black pudding, in France saussison noir. all good food, well we think it is.|`|0j61Cewwaa	Chips comes from chipped potatoes.<br>  <br>  Why do you call them FRENCH fries? Are they fried in France and then shipped to the USA?|`|sawys5wNaa	Actually, more fries (chips) are served in america than anywhere else. Just about EVERY restaurant in america serves fries (chips). Its a pretty common thing.|`|QAewZewYaa	Proper British chips are twice the size of "fries" and much tastier :) especially with lashings of salt and vinegar!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	Do you live in America?  I'm willing to bet that more fries are served HERE than anywhere else|`|smA22aNHaa	They are called chips because they are chipped potatoes.
0maJCeLCaa	In the US, I'd say New Orleans, definitely. <br>  In Europe I'd say it's Amsterdam or one of the Spanish tourist resorts like Ibiza, Benidorm or Marbella.
AA11879371	Yes, I love them with green tea!  So tasty.  I used to live in an Asian neighborhood in California and I sure miss that style of cooking in the small town were I now live.  Hmmmmmm.  Sure miss'em.|`|0maJCeLCaa	Yummy!! :P

2pRjNRa0aa	The wineries in your area are more than willing to tell you all about the wines they have. What foods are best with each wine, and which wines are meant to simply sit back and enjoy. Visiting the wineries before you guests get there would be the smart thing to do. That way, you'll already know which wineries you liked best.<br>  <br>  The thing to keep in mind about wines (and this goes for other alcoholic drinks as well), is that it's all a matter of personal preferences. Drink what you like, not what someone else tells you to drink. Also, don't let anyone tell you that a wine has to cost a lot of money to be good. As a rule, wineries tend to offer their product at a lower price than you'd pay at a specialty shop. They also tend to offer you a deal on the wine, when you buy it in larger quantities.<br>  <br>  Since you're new to wines, you might not like the dry wines. However, when sampling, start with the drier wines and work your way to sweet. If you start with sweet and work towards the dry, you'll start thinking that wine tastes like vinegar. And you won't enjoy it as much.<br>  <br>  Red wines tend to be a little "heavier" in flavor, than the whites. Meaning, more of an actual grape flavor, or fruit flavor if it's a blended wine. Roses (rosay's) will also range in taste from dry to sweet. Blush wines tend to be on the sweet side.<br>  <br>  What ever wine you find that you like, enjoy it to the fullest.

Most of the wineries offer wine tasting, and simple description on each of their wines. I have attended several wine tasting/wine route walks and every time there is something new to learn (having known nothing at all about wines when I went for the first time).<br>  You also got to try the wines to know which is the best for your taste buds, and also in combination with a variety of foods.

Red cabbage has a tendency to turn gray when cooked, the acid added by a little vinegar prevents this from happening.|`|satoCRC6aa	red cabbage bleeds the juice to a red color<br>  ok to use|`|hHCdXq0Naa	It will taste the same, but the color bleeds out of red cabbage easily - so it won't look as appetizing.

To one, a man taking his lady to a secluded restaurant, candle light, soft music - is very romantic.  To another - a home cooked meal (when they normally eat all their meals out) is very romantic - that they took the time to fix it special for them.<br>  <br>  If you are asking so you can fix the "perfect" meal for your someone special, then find out that person's likes and their favorite food.  If they talk about something their mother made for them when they were young - and you see that look of happiness as they talk about it, call their mother and get the recipe to make for them.  Just the fact that you are trying to find a meal that gives them warm thoughts - is romantic.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.

There are a fair number of spiny eel species but this one, found in the rivers of Vietnam and Southeastern Thailand, is commercially significant. Infesting freshwater rivers, streams, rice paddies and flooded forests they can grow to almost 12 inches but the photo specimen was 7.5 inches and weighed 1.1 ounces, the largest in a tray of frozen eels from Vietnam. The "spiny" part is tiny sharp stickers along the back and a couple on bottom just in front of the fin.<br>  <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  This fish would be a perfect candidate for dusting with rice flour, deep frying and eating "head, guts and feathers" - except for the spines which are mildly annoying. If you do go this route there's no need to clean them since there's almost nothing in them. On the other hand, if you're a little squeemish about that go ahead - nothing's lost because they split open during frying anyway. Only a severe sissy would cut off the heads though.<br>  <br>  You can cut off the tips of the spines with kitchen shears before frying but that doesn't help much, they go deep, and the frying will crisp the points off anyway.<br>  <br>  ?Andrew Grygus - ajg@aaxnet.com - Linking and non-commercial use permitted

1AyRPRSOaa	Pecan Praline Bars for Mardi Gras<br>  recipe image<br>  Submitted by Ginger<br>  <br>  One of the favorite treats in New Orleans—and the rest of the Deep South—is pecan pralines, candies made with cream, butter, tons of sugar, and pecans. This easy cookie recipe pays tribute to that delightful candy and obeys the law that governs Southern desserts: If it doesn't make your teeth ache, it's not worth eating.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  This dessert is great anytime of year, but it's especially suitable for Mardi Gras (February 24 this year).<br>  <br>  <br>  Laissez Les Bon Temps Rouler!

Lightly butter the bottom of a 13 x 9-inch baking pan.<br>  <br>  Break each cracker into 4 individual graham crackers. (It's easiest to do this by cutting along the score lines on the cracker with a sharp knife.) Arrange the graham crackers (32 in all) in a single layer in the pan, setting them right next to each other. You may have to squeeze the last couple of pieces in. Set aside.<br>  <br>  Put the butter and sugar in a heavy saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the vanilla, salt, and pecans.<br>  <br>  Pour the hot praline mixture evenly over the crackers and spread it gently and evenly with the back of a spoon.<br>  <br>  Bake for 8 minutes, or until the topping is puffed and bubbling. Check crackers on the edges to make sure they're not browning.<br>  <br>  Remove from the oven. Let cookies stand in the pan for 10 to 15 minutes.

c4058327d20f41accfd1c3c424c72f6faa	Yeah, most vegans do not eat honey.<br>  It's considered a products of the bees, thus an 'animal' product.  Basically products from sentient beings are off the menu, I guess you could say.  'sentient' being the debatable word, so why not just play it safe and not abuse insects etc. too.|`|64554a8e1157e502654f643d0ffe309baa	Honey is not vegan.<br>  <br>  If someone made a dish or drink for me and puts honey in it, I'd have to decline taking it. There's plenty of other sweeteners you can use in place of honey. Agave nector, for example, is vegan and has a honey-like consistency.|`|hGY08GjRaa	many vegans do not use honey.<br>  <br>  Many people call themselves vegan and still eat honey, they just stay away from meat, dairy and eggs.<br>  <br>  The only way you'll know about your friend for sure is to ask  her.<br>  <br>  Trust me.. it won't sound like a stupid question, as there are many vegans who eat honey and many who don't. She/he will appreciate your thoughtfulness in trying to comply with their diet.|`|AA10923010	Mike - Ask your friends what they eat with total honesty I am sure they will be happy to tell you.|`|jZRtTpZiaa	Hi.   Honey is not considered vegan.   So if you're making something for vegans, leave the honey out.    I substitute agave nectar <a href="https://store.nexternal.com/vegane/images/AgaveNectarBig.jpg" rel="nofollow">https://store.nexternal.com/vegane/image...</a>  because I just don't like using something vomited up by an insect.   My own position is that honey is not vegan, and most vegans I think would agree.  <br>  <br>  Occasionally I'll talk to a "vegan" who doesn't mind the honey if it's in something.  The only way to know is to ask your friend, as  what a person will eat  is ultimately a personal choice based on an individual's own beliefs.  But here's the position of the original Vegan Society against the use of honey  <a href="http://www.vegansociety.com/animals/exploitation/bees.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.vegansociety.com/animals/expl...</a>|`|LpYKda2haa	Vegans do not eat honey.  The argument that gathering honey doesn't hurt bees is like saying it doesn't hurt the goat to hand milk it....the point is moot.  Vegans don't eat any animal products.

DnFLR1wSaa	I have wondered the same thing. I guess I don't actually have an answer, but I wanted to comment. <br>     When air is whisked into egg whites, the mechanical action denatures the proteins in the whites. The denatured proteins coagulate, stiffening the foam and stabilizing the air bubbles. (<a href="http://chemistry.about.com/od/howthingsworkfaqs/f/copperbowl.htm)" rel="nofollow">http://chemistry.about.com/od/howthingsw...</a>  I'm not sure how cream whips, but it is because of the air being Incorporated into the fat, making it less dense and more airy (like how air whipped into oil makes creamy mayonnaise). So with egg whites it whips because of the protein, but cream whips because of the fat. I know that doesn't actually answer your question- sorry.|`|72hMibsVaa	Heavy cream is made of MILK.. NOT eggs.   neither make it whip... AIR makes it whip.

tFoFchuEaa	As fish burgers are often paired with mayo, I'd go with something along that route, but with more flair. Try adding some roasted garlic or fresh dill to some mayo to make a homemade topping. <br>  <br>  A relish made with capers would also pair well with salmon, as would anything with lemon.<br>  <br>  If you want to go Asian inspired, have some fried garlic slices, some scallions and a sauce made with miso or teriyaki in it.<br>  <br>  For side dishes, I'd recommend either a nice spicy coleslaw or some sweet potato fries.

gfGsXVc3aa	If you are talking about the Avocado Club Egg Rolls here is the recipe:<br>  <br>  8 Egg roll wrappers (6-inch square)<br>  1 Grilled Chicken breast, diced 3/8 inch<br>  2 large Roma tomatoes, seeded and diced 1/4 inch<br>  1/4 cup Cooked bacon, chopped (1 to 2 strips)<br>  2 ounces Monterey Jack cheese, grated<br>  1 medium Ripe Hass avocado, peeled, pitted, and sliced<br>  2 large Eggs<br>  2 tablespoons cold water<br>  2 tablespoons cornstarch<br>  2 to 3 cups vegetable oil <br>  4 large sprigs Italian (flat-leaf) parsley<br>  1/4 cup Ranch dressing<br>  1/4 cup Mayonnaise<br>  1 tablespoon + 1 1/2 teaspoons hot sauce<br>  <br>  Place the egg roll wrappers on a flat, dry surface with one corner of each pointing toward you (i.e., as a diamond, not a square).<br>  <br>  Distribute the chicken, tomatoes, bacon, and  cheese on the wrappers in a row that is 1 1/2 to 2 inches wide and 5 inches long. Make sure that the filling is never less than 1 inch from the edge of the wrapper. Divide the avocado slices among the egg rolls, placing them on top of the cheese with the longer (skin) side toward you.<br>  <br>  Stir the eggs in a small bowl to lightly liquify. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water and beat with a fork until evenly mixed.<br>  <br>  Working with one egg roll at a time, lightly brush egg wash over 1/2 inch of each side of the wrapper. Fold the corner closest to you over the filling, pressing down and pulling tight toward the center. Press the left and right corners down to seal the edge. Lightly coat the 2 bottom corners with egg wash, then fold right and left corners inwards over the filling, pressing down to seal the edge. Add additional egg wash to the top corner creases and press down to seal. Continue rolling into a compact roll, pressing lightly to seal all edges.<br>  <br>  Line a 9 x 13-inch baking dish with waxed or parchment paper. Sift half the cornstarch over the paper, and place the finished egg rolls in the dish, making sure they do not touch one another. If you’re going to fry the egg rolls later, sift the remaining cornstarch over the egg rolls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for up to 24 hours.<br>  <br>  Heat the oil to 375° F in a deep 10-inch skillet. Fry the egg rolls, making sure that they are not touching (you may have to do this in 2 batches), for about 1 1/2 minutes. Turn with tongs, and fry for another 1 to 1 1/2 minutes, or until the egg rolls are golden brown all over. Remove with tongs and drain completely on paper towels. Cut each egg roll in half diagonally and garnish each pair with a sprig of parsley.<br>  <br>  Dipping Sauce: Make Ranchito Sauce by whisking 1/2 cup of ranch dressing with the mayonnaise and hot sauce. Serve the egg rolls with the Ranchito Sauce in one bowl and the remaining 3/4 cup ranch dressing in another bowl on the side for dipping.<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps you and enjoy!
f262cda35c3c0959f3b4089b38f0359faa	Contrary to what some say you CAN buy a whole beef or a side of beef from your local butcher cut and packaged to your specifications, and it is so much less that in a grocery store. Not as little as a grocer could buy for but, well worth the expense as long as you have a freezer to store it.|`|F9Mrquc5aa	your best bet isnt online but it is to find a butcher near your home and ask if he has package deals. the meat market buy my house will give you a heck of a deal if you spend at least 50 bucks. it is usually a variety of meats and usually they are larger cuts then the items one would get in a normal meat section.  it doesnt hurt to invest in a large freezer to store bigger cuts.  as a good rule of thumb the more you buy the more they cut price. <br>  good luck.|`|jM6xUrrRaa	If there was such a great deal, supermarkets would buy it up and sell it themselves.<br>  <br>  Supermarkets in the UK and Walmart and Randalls, all pressure their suppliers to create the lowest costs they can.<br>  The farmers of this world do not plan on eating all the animals they raise, they sell them to make money!
EMDNVrcjaa	I don't see anything for you online. You could just buy a flavored oil and rub into the metal. They make all different flavors for cooking like mint, cinnamon, etc. You can buy them at cake decorating stores, craft stores and Wal-Mart.
fynzkVK4aa	I would recommend the "pasta and sauce" packs you can get...they come in a range of flavours and all you have to do is chuck the pack into boiling water and boil for a few mins.  They are dried so really light weight to carry about, and you wouldn't need any extra sauces or anything to put on them.<br>  <br>  Most supermarkets stock them and they are about 78p a pack if you get the Batchelors ones, although most of the big supermarkets have their own version too which are slightly cheaper.  Asdas have the Batchelors ones on offer at the moment for 3 packs for ￡2...bargain!<br>  <br>  I used to take Pot Noodles and Pot Mash etc with me for stuff like that too, which may also be worth considering.  <br>  <br>  Have fun! :)|`|7cUDstdjaa	Go to a camping store such as Millets and they'll have 'Expedition Food Packs' with all sorts of 'just heat' or 'just add water' type dehydrated meals.

They are made by the horrible and devious Coca Cola Corporation and they cost a lot of money and you could make your own juices a lot cheaper and better for you or if you want stuff like that I recommend Bolthouse Farms (which is not tied to the Bolthouse foundation which is a very nasty little foundation that funded prop 8 which was founded by former owners who sold their stocks in '05) or better yet home juicing
bmoCpcdraa	yes you may,|`|cz5XbKfOaa	Yes. Here is what the USDA says <br>  Households CAN use SNAP benefits to buy:<br>     Foods for the household to eat, such as:<br>     -- breads and cereals<br>  -- fruits and vegetables<br>  -- meats, fish and poultry; and<br>  -- dairy products<br>     Seeds and plants which produce food for the household to eat.<br>  <br>  Households CANNOT use SNAP benefits to buy:<br>     Beer, wine, liquor, cigarettes or tobacco<br>     Any nonfood items, such as:<br>     -- pet foods;<br>  -- soaps, paper products; and<br>  -- household supplies.<br>     Vitamins and medicines.<br>     Food that will be eaten in the store.<br>     Hot foods<br>  <br>  In some areas, restaurants can be authorized to accept SNAP benefits from qualified homeless, elderly, or disabled people in exchange for low-cost meals. SNAP benefits cannot be exchanged for cash.|`|d46f610a60316733e6c17cc867554da4aa	Yes it is. I found your question interesting, so I did a little searching. Most items that are designated as "food" may be purchased - although you cannot buy prepared hot foods that are cooked in the store. <br>  On a side-note, I've found that many people get upset at this idea - I suppose they believe that such food choices are poor ones. I'm not an expert on this issue, but it seems that it would be difficult to buy many healthy items on a limited food stamp budget - I'm guessing that a "typical" recipient uses food stamps to buy milk, eggs, bread, ground beef, beans, etc.

K5XDXRK7aa	Do you like cheese? If you can have one or two slices a day that will give you enough calcium.  For drinks, there is some kind of tablet, which is a mixture of vitamin C and calcium. You just put the tablet in a cup of water and you'll get a cup of orange soda( usually they are orange flavor) and it's sugar free.  I've forgotten the name but you can go and look for it at you pharmacist.|`|96wfOoQiaa	There are kids calcium gummy bears-you take two a day.

That is simply retarded. The makers of antacids like tums puts calcium in their products because antacids deplete the body of calcium in the first place. The only thing taking tums will do is just replace the calcium that it depletes you of. How stupid and wasteful is that?<br>  <br>  Breaking up your calcium tablets and dissolving them in water may not taste good at all. You may try that in juice or something else.<br>  <br>  However there are tablets that you can chew which should be helpful.<br>  <br>  You can add syrup to milk. I don't like plain milk but I drink the heck out of chocolate milk.<br>  <br>  You don't have to rely on just dairy or supplements to get your calcium.<br>  <br>  You can eat cheese and yogurt. Also salmon, sardines, seafood and dark green leafy vegetables have calcium in them. Calcium can also be found in almonds, figs, oats, prunes, sesame seeds, soybeans, tofu, and whey.|`|WGVHKF7Aaa	Mabye try different types of milk, such as soy or lactaid, try pills mabye, or just force yourself to drink some milk, the more you drink it the sooner you will start to like it, like me.

72hMibsVaa	buttermilk is used as a coating in chicken.  i never dip mine in milk before flouring.  changes the flavor too much. <br>  <br>  just dredge in flour and fry.|`|53giV6PFaa	For coating purposes - I use buttermilk, because it makes a really nice thick, crispy coating and it doesn't change the flavor of the chicken at all.  If you are using it for a coating, then just use milk or a simple egg wash (beaten eggs with water).<br>  <br>  I also marinate fried chicken pieces in buttermilk with some pepper.  It makes the chicken really juicy.  It also doesn't change the taste.

AA12330904	Pernil<br>  <br>  A 5-7 pound of bone-in pork shoulder costs less than $1.99 a pound (that adds up to only $10-$14 for a whole pork shoulder!).<br>  <br>  <br>  1 Bone-In Pork Shoulder (5-10 Pounds depending on how many you want to feed, 5 Pounds will feed 3-4 hungry people) <br>  5-8 Cloves garlic, some chopped, some sliced  depending on your preference of how much you want to use.<br>  Adobo (or a mixture of garlic power, onion powder, cumin, black pepper, salt and oregano) <br>  1 Bottle of Sour Orange Marinade (or 2 Oranges and 1 Lime OR 1 Cup OJ and 2 Limes) <br>  1 Large Onion, chopped up <br>  olive oil<br>   <br>  So the night before you cook the meat (or, if you prefer to not let it sit, then the half hour before you cook the meat):<br>  <br>  Take your  delish pork shoulder/butt, place it in a baking dish skin-side up and sprinkle it all over w/ adobo (Goya makes a few versions of this that you can keep in your spice cabinet or you can make your own by sprinkling garlic power, onion powder, cumin, black pepper, salt and oregano all over the pork). WHEN I SAY SPREAD IT ALL OVER I MEAN SPREAD IT ALL OVER. Don’t be afraid of putting on too much. <br>  Cut slices of garlic up from about 3 cloves of garlic - make slices thick-ish. (NOTE: If you have the extra time, make a paste out of your garlic by smashing it in a mortar and pestle w/ a bit of salt to aid in the smashing until it has the consistancy of a spreadable paste.) <br>  <br>  ****NOTE: This recipe uses alot of garlic b/c I like alot of garlic. If you don’t like the taste of garlic,don't use as much.Take a sharp knife (a steak knife should be fine) and make 1-inch wide (1 inch deep or so) slits all over the pork, skin and all. Every time you make a slit, slide in a slice of garlic into the slit. It’s best if the garlic goes into the hole all the way. If it doesn’t, again, don’t worry… just make a bit of a deeper slit next time. (NOTE: If you made the garlic paste, then just slide a bit of the paste in each slit instead of the sliced garlic.) <br>  <br>  MAKE MARINADE IN SEPARATE BOWL: Add one cup of sour orange juice (again, Goya makes a bottled version, I’m sure it’s not as tasty as the real ones, but sour oranges aren’t around all the time to buy) to 3 cloves of chopped garlic and 1 chopped large onion. Add a sprinkling of salt and pepper and well as some extra oregano. Mix. (NOTE: You can also substitute sour orange w/ a cup of regular Orange Juice mixed w/ the juice of two limes, or juice of 2 oranges, juice of 1 lime.) <br>  Pour your marinade over your pork. Let sit for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight). <br>  <br>  Preheat oven to 350 degrees. <br>  Rub some olive oil over the pork and pork skin. <br>  Put pork in oven, skin-side up, cover w/ aluminum foil and bake for about 4-5 hours, depending on size of pork. (I’d say allow about a half hour per pound in baking time if using bone-in pork - but remember, the best thing about a pork shoulder is that it gets better the longer you cook it. Just don’t burn that skin.) <br>  After about an hour and a half, check how much liquid remains in the pan - add a cup of water to the pan if you are low. Check every 30-45 minutes to make sure the liquid level remains about at least 1/2 ” deep. The pan drippings will mix with this and make a nice gravy. <br>  About 20 minutes before the end of the cooking time, remove the aluminum foil to crunch up that delicious pork .20 minutes may not be long enough to crunch up the skin enough. This will depend on your oven (and your taste). I would advise to keep looking at the roast after you remove the aluminum foil and when it looks brown and crispy, it’s done. Could be anywhere from 20 -35 minutes. <br>  After you remove the pork from the oven, let it rest for about 15-20 minutes. <br>  Slice it up or shred it with your fork! ENJOY. <br>  <br>  <br>  You can serve with black beans and rice and Flan for dessert call it a day...<br>  <br>  Flan<br>  <br>  1 12 oz. can evaporated milk<br>  5 eggs<br>  1 tsp. vanilla extract<br>  1/8 tsp. salt<br>  1/2 cup sugar (for mix)<br>  3/4 cup sugar (for caramel)<br>  <br>  In a Pyrex (glass) round baking mold, place the 3/4 cup sugar and cook on medium heat (Do not stir) until you get a golden light brown caramel. DO NOT BURN FOR IT TASTES BAD!!!<br>  <br>  Coat the caramel all around the mold and set aside.<br>  <br>  In a blender, mix the eggs, evaporated milk, 1/2 cup sugar, vanilla extract and salt.<br>  <br>  Pour the mix through a strainer and into the caramelized mold.<br>  <br>  Cook in the microwave oven for 8 minutes covered.<br>  <br>  Be sure and put a plate under the mold in case the carmel over flows.<br>  <br>  To make sure it is done, do the knife test by inserting a knife in the middle of the flan. If it comes out clean, it is done.<br>  <br>  Let the flan cool off for about 2 hours. Run a knife around the rim of the mold then, very carefully, turn it over onto a flat plate just before you are going to serve it.<br>  <br>  Garnish with berries. <br>   <br>  Tips <br>  If you love the caramel, add more sugar when making the caramel.<br>  <br>  Serve with ice cream ,Cool Whip  or your favorite fruit.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  I hope this was useful,Take Care!!! :)

khXGGBiTaa	It really depends on your reasons for becoming vegetarian. If it's to reduce/eliminate your reliance on foods which (directly) require animals to be killed, then you might want to rethink including products containing gelatin and/or rennet. At the end of the day, it's your personal choice, but most vegetarians would not consider a diet which includes gelatin and rennet to be a truly vegetarian diet.

There are no "rules" you have to follow.|`|D6M975deaa	It's up to you if you want to go to the extreme and not eat anything that has to do with coming from an animal... than no.|`|4tHjpW9saa	yes its vegan that cant eat thinks like dairy, eggs, etc|`|oQs2i4Z9aa	Corporate-owned factories where cows are warehoused in huge sheds and treated like milk machines have replaced most small family farms. With genetic manipulation and intensive production technologies, it is common for modern dairy cows to produce 100 pounds of milk a day— 10 times more than they would produce in nature. To keep milk production as high as possible, farmers artificially inseminate cows every year. Growth hormones and unnatural milking schedules cause dairy cows' udders to become painful and so heavy that they sometimes drag on the ground, resulting in frequent infections and overuse of antibiotics. Cows— like all mammals— make milk to feed their own babies— not humans.<br>  <br>  Male calves, the "byproducts" of the dairy industry, endure 14 to 17 weeks of torment in veal crates so small that they can't even turn around. Female calves often replace their old, worn-out mothers, or are slaughtered soon after birth for the rennet in their stomachs (an ingredient of most commercial cheeses). They are often kept in tiny crates or tethered in stalls for the first few months of their lives, only to grow up to become "milk machines" like their mothers.<br>  <br>  If you don't feel wrong for contributing to this kind of animal cruelty, go ahead and drink milk.|`|k0B8err5aa	The correct term is a lacto-vegetarian. Meaning you still eat milk and cheese. About the gelatin: that would really depend on why you are vegetarian. If you're like me, my reason is because I love animals. I don't eat candy unless it says vegan or vegetarian. You can find local grocery stores that have tons of vegan/vegetarian options. (wholefoods, trader joes, sunflower market, sprouts). Also, unless your fruits and veggies say organic, they are covered in stuff made from bugs called shellac. (edit: also look into finding soy versions of those dairy products if you like. soy yogurt and milk are delicious!)|`|eo0DKI0qaa	gelatin is a big no, and if you think you want to be vegan than you can just have soy milk, rice cheese, vegan yogurt ect. I started last year when I was 15 and switched to vegan gradually, so take your time. Dairy is vegetarian but cheese uses rennet (enzymes on label) that are cow intestines so avoid that as well. If you have any more questions feel free to email.|`|BG64cYbdaa	semi vegetarian- eats no red meat but eats chicken and fish.

IbWBAwVPaa	If they are in a can they are probably already cooked so DON'T cook them. Artichokes go well in MANY THINGS, salad, pasta, hummus, spreads, dips, on pizza. You can put in it sauces and put it on chicken or fish. There are SO many things you can do with canned or bottled artichoke hearts! It's endless! <br>  <br>  Personally I just eat them right from the can or jar, they have almost no fat or carbs so you can eat tons of them and not gain a pound! Bonus! I would check out some recipe websites. My personal favorites are spinach and artichoke dip with corn chips or artichoke hummus with pita chips.|`|DoHaUEziaa	I'm guessing you don't have the whole artichoke? If you have canned or jarred artichokes hearts then just quarter them. If you're serving in a salad; leave cold. If you're serving a hot dish; just heat through. It also makes a difference in taste if they're packed in vinager or not. Especially, depending on what you're using them for. You could just eat them out of the jar. Yum.|`|Gsa0X2yuaa	Peel boil season to your taste|`|VIgfOpyaaa	They even taste very well just out of the can. When I was in Spain, there they head artichoke hearts with a mixed salad with a vinegar and olive oil dressing only. Guten Appetit.|`|DfK4JSytaa	They are nice added to a green salad. You can cut them in quarters, mix in with lettuce,baby spinach, and diced red pepper. Add a vinaigrette dressing or blue cheese dressing.<br>  <br>  They taste good and are nutritious.
cLa7nwhcaa	'Beans don't burn on the grill' is a line from a TV comedy about a black family during 1960s.<br>  The show is set in New York City. Mr George Jefferson and family grows up in a poor neighborhood in New York City. The daily diet consists of hot dog and beans, and fish-fry. Through hard work, the dry cleaning business of Mr Jefferson becomes a success and the family moves to deluxe apartment on the East side.<br>  It is the story of black family whose hard work pays off and finally join the American dream and become part of the middle class. No longer, do they need to eat hot dogs and beans, or eat fish fry.<br>  <br>  'Fish don’t fry in the kitchen;<br>  Beans don’t burn on the grill.<br>  Took a whole lotta tryin’ just to get up that hill.'<br>  <br>  The Beans don't burn on the grill, because beans are no longer cooked in the kitchen as a part of the daily diet.|`|BiHbT9pTaa	They can.

AA10458296	It is not restricted to alcohol, I've heard nutritionists tell people to drink their weight in water, e.g. 200 lbs, 200 oz a day.

When cows eat cows, as in problems in the past related to enhanced feed, they developed Mad Cow Disease. If a person ate a person, even if they were a vegan, wouldn't you likely contract Mad People's Disease, e.g. Schizophrenia or some other reality perception disorder? Just a guess.|`|LzPrYqDsaa	It would probably be the healthiest thing you have ever eaten in you life!|`|8yE2sYGeaa	No, being vegan means you not only reject all meat, but animal products as well (eggs, cheese, milk and ice cream)|`|1K8NPRUOaa	eating a vegan is still wrong. you can still go to jail if you did actually ate another human being.|`|pMFLqU0Yaa	Cows are vegans, but human vegans shouldn't be eaten. If you do, you can get a prion disease called "Kuru", which is the human cannibal's version of mad cow disease. It, and other diseases like it are called transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, or TSEs, and it used to be prevalent in the tribes of Papau New Guinea. Part of their rituals  for the dead included eating the brain tissue of their deceased. They've since stopped this practice and the disease has disappeared.

DT2mU1jOaa	Beer. But what else can one say about the taste of beer? There are many styles and flavors are different both between the styles and within them. Sometimes a beer has a yeast-like flavor and other times a beer can have a nutty-bread crust flavor. You can experience bitter, sweet, salty (slightly), and sour flavors in a beer. Then there are specialty beers which  may add coffee, chocolate (cocoa), fruits, spices, and many other ingredients to add yet more flavor to a beer.<br>  <br>  If you are curious about beer flavor try a selection at your local bar/pub or buy a selection from the store. In either case the proprietor can help you. Enjoy all the beer.|`|48846255239e6cfd4e8b805cbae9c844aa	intense liquid nutty bread.|`|TGRUUWiwaa	First time its a bitter gagging taste.

One of my best past times is rescuing animals, and finding homes for them at our local shelters.<br>  -I've been a vegetarian all of my life, and because I Never Liked Meat, all meat: Chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc. I never could swallowed it and just got nauseous, literally.<br>  All the vegetarians I know have similar experiences but not because of the treatment of animals.<br>  You should Listen to your Body, as I did, and give to it what it asked and Not what you want to give to it.<br>  I was a little boy when I became a vegetarian, and something you should know also: Never become a vegetarian from one day to the next. The process should be slowly because you don't want to harm your body by shocking it.<br>  -There's no risk involved, on the opposite, you become more alert; skin is one of the first giving changes and becoming healthy looking and spotless; being tired is a thing of the past; etc...<br>  -Many vegetables have supplements for the nutrition meat gives you, and also besides tofu, there's always many powers added to any meal or drink to replace proteins.|`|LywVUxsTaa	Vegetable protein is much healthier than animal protein.  You can get protein from beans, nuts, leafy green veggies, and yes, tofu.|`|hmbtnkIbaa	There is very little health risk to a properly balanced vegetarian diet. In fact, in many cases it is considerably healthier than a meat based diet. There are numerous studies showing that vegetarianism is linked with lower risk for heart disease, obesity, stroke, and cancer. <br>  <br>  Besides the health benefits and obvious moral issues involved, there are some significant environmental issues as well. The process of raising livestock for meat production is a huge contributor to air and water pollution - and a major cause of global warming.|`|njHgfl99aa	Well first of all you wouldn't be consuming animal fat or oils so I guess that's good in a sense for your heart.<br>  <br>  Also by becoming a vegetarian you'll feel less tired and more energetic.

0coU82xuaa	Well...I read some of the answers...<br>  "Mexican cheese" is offensive...what?  So then is "French cheese" offensive.  Basically saying Mexican cheese means very little to almost nothing.   Let's be more specific here...<br>  <br>  Queso Quesadilla...is wonderful even on enchiladas...melts like a dream and is totally yummy.<br>  <br>  Chihuahua...is also a classic cheese for this entree...many qualities of it but generally a good melter as well<br>  <br>  Memonita is another commonly used cheese for mexican food that melts well.<br>  <br>  If you can shred your own...it makes for fresher taste.  Most preshredded cheese will have some kind of gas added to the bag to keep it fresh and separated...so try to shred your own.<br>  <br>  Don't use mozzarella unless you absolutely can not find the 3 cheeses mentioned above.  Mozzarella has nothing to do with Mexican food...and colby...what?  colby.  I've been to Mexico and ordered enchiladas...and I can assure you none of it had colby in it.|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I like shredded real mozzarella best, but you can get specialty Mexican cheese too (maybe it's called Cochina, or something like that).

ubukt8WWaa	I'm big on whole grain everything, but whole wheat pasta is really a stretch.  It's very different than regular pasta - in both taste and texture.<br>  <br>  My favorite healthier pasta is Barilla Plus (in the yellow box).  It tastes almost exactly like regular pasta but contains more fiber, more protein and fewer carbs.  Give it a try.|`|A1GnMXBMaa	It definitely alters the taste the first few times you eat pasta, but I have completely switched over to whole grain pasta. My husband, who is a very picky eater (and only eats white bread), loves the taste now, and I've found it's easier to achieve 'al dente' (literally 'to the tooth') doneness with it. I would say if you are partial to the taste, a robust tomato based sauce might be better than simply coating it with cream (which might taste odd if you end up not liking it). In fact, the acidity in the tomatoes will most likely "hide" the difference. Give it a shot though--totally good for you, and I've found I now prefer it.|`|jFbmYcWYaa	i LOVEEEE wheat pasta!!! I don't even eat it with sause...its amazing plain! I have to say that the best kind of wheat pasta is from Giant Eagle. Just the plain Giant Eagle brand.<br>  <br>  Now that i've had it, I hate eating normal pasta. Ima never switchingg backk!!! =] x|`|c96633710b410e7a79acb5b94630ad09aa	i love whole wheat pasta!  but if you are afraid to make the switch there are a lot of whole wheat blend pastas at the grocery store that are more like the pasta you are used to.|`|03Y7DMdiaa	Hi, i think its ok...not to everyones taste....some people think it tastes cardboardy...but its alot healthier and as long as you have a tastey sauce its nice. It doesnt taste sweet and it wont ruin your yummy sauce...so no worries!|`|hHCdXq0Naa	I've made it, and my husband won't eat it.  It's hard - not the same texture as regular pasta.  It's a waste of good sauce to put it on there:)   If you add tofu to the sauce, that will counteract the carbs in regular pasta (so you won't raise your blood sugar);  or you could use spaghetti squash instead - or get noodles that are enriched with spinach
GIwwNIICaa	Hi, the name for all cream soups is velute. It is made with a base of butter, flour, fish stock for seafood, vegetable stock or chicken stock or you can use milk.<br>  Method for 6<br>  60g, of butter<br>  60g, of plain sifted flour,<br>  2Lt, of stock required,<br>  salt and pepper,<br>  <br>  Add butter to the pan, when melted take it off the fire, add the flour and whisk it well into the butter. Return pan to the fire and lower heat to med, stirring mixture until it is slightly golden - approximately 3-4 minutes - pour cold stock into the pot and stir until the soup comes to a boil, turn the heat to low and simmer for about 30 minutes. Add salt and pepper, add your chicken, ham, mushrooms or whatever and if you want it richer also add a cup of cream and cook for 5 extra minutes and serve|`|fwCMOGeyaa	Look up a recipe for a Bechamel Sauce (a classic cream sauce) and try adding a chicken flavored bouillon cube (just be careful to not add any salt before the bouillon cube as they can be very salty on their own and may add enough saltiness).  Then, roast chicken and dice it very small and add it to the sauce.  Bechamel is very versatile and delicious!<br>  <br>  Good luck!

kSlycVwnaa	It will if you let the ice melt.  But adding ice also adds volume to the glass meaning that you get less drink.|`|2zd9OjeMaa	Yes.|`|kT8rhVdLaa	if you let it sit and let the ice melt of course,|`|Gt8o7ICLaa	Of course. thats why you drink most decent whiskey ( jack daniels) on the rocks. the water takes away a bit of the harshness, but also dilutes it. plus it opens the flavor up nicely. but with some whisky,  such as Chivas Regal, you would add just a touch of water to it, no ice. i dont know anything about canadian whisky, or whiskey, except that you suck if you drink it.|`|zI5UFV6yaa	it can.

C3LiKhm8aa	Depends on how much salt you added and how big the batch of bread dough is.<br>  <br>  If you are pretty sure you doubled the salt, then just make another batch of dough without the salt and then knead the two batches together. You will have twice the bread you intended to have, but you can freeze the bread.  You can also put half the dough in the refrigerator for three or four days without harm, then take it out of the refrigerator, warm it up, shape it, rise it and bake it then, so your mistake will lead to great bread for a week!  Lucky you!<br>  <br>  If you added just a portion too much, then increase the batch size by the amount of salt extra and proceed as above.  If you added 50% too much salt, then make a batch that's 50% of the original batch and go on from there.|`|ylJoUuMDaa	Nothing you can do now.  Make a new batch.|`|fwCMOGeyaa	I agree with the previous post.  Even if it rises, it won't taste good.  Starting over is the only option.

And if  you wantyou can combine them and do a dance party with karaoke and each of you take your turns singing and dancing and you could choreograph dances and other things. for the fashion you could also do red carpet or something like that and you could take pictures of them when they wake down the carpet and make flyers with them or what ever.

ca4052dcf92105bc08a15acab9b057b8aa	Don't be afraid to mix and match individual vegan ingredients.  Also, if you're unsure about whether something is vegan or not, ASK ASK ASK!  Inquire as to whether or not something is vegan in your dining hall, or ask for an ingredients list.  Colleges are becoming more and more accommodating for people with specific dietary needs and should be able to provide ingredient lists.<br>  For pre-packaged foods, get used to reading ingredient lists.  After a semester of buying food for myself, I could usually looks at a list of ingredients and tell whether or not it's vegan within a couple of seconds.  Once you make a routine of it, everything becomes much easier.|`|r0xeCZAQaa	If you are on a food plan, then just eat things that have no animal products in them (you should ask for an ingredient listing for the pita and the veggie burgers, and the spaghetti sauce of your choice -- since it is a public facility, they should have that information available to you)
KQL3tqS7aa	I believe they say upto 2 hours, but I always try to put mine in the refrigerator as soon as possible.|`|dbw210qqaa	food should not be left out for more than an hour

KQL3tqS7aa	Peanut butter doesn't contain butter.  The fat in peanuts is the "healthy" fat as they say....the fat helps your heart, in moderate quantities.  Probably the best peanut butter you could choose, is the natural type.  Or you could even make your own peanut butter, in which you would know exactly what's in it.|`|LsAArkUyaa	Margarine is much worse for you than butter is.<br>  <br>  As for peanut butter...it does not contain any butter at all.
RU2Yz6jEaa	to tell if eggs are rotten just place them uncooked (with the shells still on)  in a deep dish of water. the fresher ones will float<br>  also whenever making spinach quiche, be sure to REALLY REALLY squeeze out the water from the spinach. ( place the spinach onto a lint free tea towel, or cheesecloth, and squeeze out the liquids)  this could have caused the seperation.

Let the glaze cool before spreading it over the cheesecake.<br>  <br>  Or you can use condensed milk. Use some lemon zest and a tiny squirt of fresh lemon juice. Test it, if the glaze is not sweet enough, add a little bit of sugar. if the glaze is too thin, add a bit of cornstarch to it|`|tqD9xUpYaa	If you have a blender, use that with granulated sugar until it powders.|`|fwCMOGeyaa	Make a simple syrup and flavor it with fresh lemon juice.  It won't have the "glazed" look once you pour it on a baked item, but it will help keep it moist and add a delicious lemon flavor.<br>  <br>  1 cup granulated sugar<br>  1 cup water<br>  Fresh lemon juice to taste<br>  <br>  Heat sugar and water in small sauce pan over medium heat until sugar dissolves.  Simmer for about 5 minutes.  Let cool to room temp and add fresh lemon juice to taste.  <br>  <br>  I've brushed this on fresh baked pound cake.  Immediately after I take the cake out of the oven, I poke holes with a skewer, and brush the lemon syrup on top.  The skewer holes let the syrup soak deep in the cake.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|Obdx1IMiaa	you cant im sorry!

Then saute the garlic in olive oil until golden, add the red pepper flakes and anchovies and mash with a fork. When the spaghetti is cooked, drain [save some of the water]. Put spaghetti into the garlic/oil pan and toss. Add some of the reserved water as needed. Use freshly ground black pepper. Adjust the ingredients to your taste. Fast, easy and cheap.
