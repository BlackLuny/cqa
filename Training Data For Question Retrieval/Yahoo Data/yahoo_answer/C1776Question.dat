I am sure we all feel for David Cameron and his wife Samantha at the loss of their Son Ivan, Bit did the Daily Mail have to Take and publish a Picture of them leaving the Hospital I know he is a public figure but surely this is a very private moment for them both many of us have had a bereavement at some time but nobody wants to lose a child so even as I have said he is a public figure but this is one time I feel that the press should leave both him and his wife alone lets hope they don't turn up at the funeral
20090226101028AAlSvHz	News & Events;Media & Journalism	Why aren't the tv shows and news, ect. talking about how very low income ppl are suffering too?	I hear all these stories how people went from making 80,000 a year to nothing and they are losing everything. yea it sucks and I understand by why isn't any body talking about ppl like my family and I. My husband only made about 18,000 for the year but it was perfect for us til I could get done with school. but since his job went out of business out of the blue we have spent the last 6 months rebuilding ourselves. we had to sell everything (which wasn't much but it was ours) we owned except clothes and personal stuff. we've moved twice and are finally doin a bit better. I don't see anybody trying to help us. the jobs suck and the pay is even worse and for the first time in 8 years I can't find a job for myself but even then who will watch my daughter? We are just a young couple trying so hard to finish college and take care of our family. now my husband has a son we are trying to get visitation of but because of our situation we can't afford to go to court and the mother is keeping my step son from us. We all struggle and we all need to be heard and we all need to help our community's grow stronger and build and better future for my children.
20090226101223AAMAu1m	News & Events;Current Events	Is Obama really doing the bad things critics say is happening?	I'm really getting discouraged about all this. They say he is making our economy worse by the second, but I know that is probably not true and they say he didn't stay with the soldiers very long they say he shook only one hand and that's it. That's a lie as well, but is an African-American president really a good leader?                   Democratic anwsers only! No Republicans allowed!

You could just feel sympathy for the family who has just lost their 6 year old son, and you could just feel sorry for the woman who is about to die and the boys who are about to lose their mother but NO, you have to complain that they are getting 'more media coverage' or some other irrelevant crap.

What is WRONG with this world?!

20090226143503AAUCdJV	News & Events;Media & Journalism	What do you think about Miley Cyrus' racial photo?	She's being sued for $4 billion for a photo of her and her friends posing   with one Asian friend and pulling their eyes into a slant.      Here's the photo.  http://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/mile...       Now, me being 100% American/Caucasian..   I find this picture INCREDIBLY racist.   Sure, it was a simple gesture, but all of her white friends are doing it as well. & Miley said, "I was just making a goofy face."   What if someone painted their face black and wore dreadlocks as a stereotype for African Americans & claimed it was just a "goofy face"?   (By the way, nothing against African Americans)      So, me personally, I think she crossed the line.   She should be sued. (I never liked her show anyway =D)      That being my opinion (no arguments please?), what's yours?   :O
