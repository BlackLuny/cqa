I was wondering, "Who is the true champion of scotland?"      1- In the league, the title is rewarded to the team with most consistency. IE: Hearts can beat Celtic 3/4 times. But Celtic will beat the smaller teams.    - The title is awarded to the team that basically is the richest, and able to outlast all other teams with depth.       2- Cup- The teams play in the purest form of football....."survival football".   - Every team in Scotland gets a fair crack at this, in a do or die match up.      If it wasnt for the fact that the league drags on longer, and that there is a bigger prize available (conveniently since the big 2 have a much higher chance of winning the league), should the Scottish cup determine the true champion of scotland?

20090226175858AAI9bkC	Sports;Wrestling	What Is Your WWE Dream Match?	The name of the game is simple. Who would you like to see lock horns in the squared circle? What is your dream match?      One of the questions I get asked the most is wouldn't it be great if so and so had a match? I then realized that everyone has that one match as a pro wrestling fan they're itching to see.      For me it isn't any different but it is difficult to just think of one.      Thankfully, after a lot of thought, it was obvious who I wanted in my so-called dream match.      The Undertaker vs. Sting      For many years now, I have been a huge fan of both The Undertaker and Sting. I having been praying that one day we could see a these two headline a main event someday.      The Undertaker is undefeated at WreslteMania with a 16-0 record and is a six-time World Champion.      He is a four-time WWE Champion and two-time World Heavyweight Champion.      He was also the winner of the 2007 Royal Rumble in which he became the first man to win the Rumble starting at number 30.      As a single wrestler, Sting has technically won a total of 13 World Heavyweight Championships in various promotions, though only ten of these reigns are recognized as "World" title reigns by Pro Wrestling Illustrated.      He is a two-time NWA Champion, six-time WCW Champion and two-time (and current) TNA Champion.      He is arguably the most well-known wrestler to have never signed with WWE.      Both mens styles vary from each other but that's why I think this would make one hell of an interesting matchup.      I couldn't pick a winner for you but if it did happen, Sting would probably not want to fight him at WrestleMania.      With Sting and The Undertaker coming to the end of the illustrious careers, it looks less likely we would ever see this.      We can always dream though.      But the question is, "what would your dream match be?"      Thanks In Advance!

These 3 Guys Seem to be the 3 Most Scrutinized Performers For "Can't Wrestle" Remarks from People.   We All know None of Them are Bret Hart's , or William Regal's or Ricky Steamboat's , But Who is Actually the Better "Wrestler"      Cena - "Only has 5 Moves"   Batista - "Botchtista"   Jeff Hardy - "He Can't do Anything but Jump Off Things"      *I'd just like to Say , IMO , all 3 of those Statements are Ignorant.*      All 3 CAN Wrestle , But Their Gimmicks are Set to be that - They Don't.   ~Cena is a Brawler & a Mic Guy. He Doesn't Need to be a Bret Hart Type Guy.   ~Batista is a Powerhouse. Plain & Simple. His Gimmick is Too Just Pound a Guy Out with Basic Moves.   ~Jeff Hardy is a Daredevil Risk Taker. his Gimmick is to Be that "Crash & Burn" Performer.      Also , Remember , WWE Limits ALL Performers Move Sets.   Not Just These 3 Guys.   NO ONE on the Roster Uses More than 5-7 Unique Moves.   10 if They're DAMN Lucky.   And that's Simply So Fans (Especially Kids) can become Familiar with Them.      if You Look back at These Guys (or Anyone on the WWE Roster) in OVW or any other Indy Promotion , Everyone CAN Wrestle , It's Just in WWE They Don't let Them.   CM Punk is THE Best Example - He was Awesome in the Indies , Yet He's So Watered Down in WWE , It's Not Even Funny.         So Here's the Question: Out of Cena , Batista , & Jeff Hardy , Who is the Better "Wrestler" When it Comes to Fluidity of Moves & "In Ring Psychology"?      Thanks.

But iverson and sheed are gone next year so they have a lot of cap space this off-season so i think they should Sign someone like amare or boozer maybe even both. Or should they sign a few role players wait till the 2010 free agents. I think they should just do something this year amaree is better than bosh and for sure they won't get lebron or wade. So i guess if they don't anything this offseason they should still be better cause some balance will be back with iverson gone. But anyway i do think the pistons will be contenders again soon.

Ariza is a much better shooter. i know Phil likes having him to come off the bench but we have plenty of scoring in our starting line up, we need Ariza's D. Morrison is a better player than Luke with a lot omore potential. Luke is at his max which is sad. We signed Luke and Sasha too fast and for too much... Now that Morrison is healthy he needs to be the #2 option behind Ariza. He is a better scorer than Luke and would be a better spark off the bench than Luke. Move Brown and Morrison up...      We wasted money on Luke and than Sasha which would have been better spent on Turiaf. We should have develople a D leaguer like Crawford instead of Sasha

20090225120635AAlEfMG	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Hunting	.308 Bolt-action recommendations?	Hey there. I'm not new to shooting, but most of my experience involves AR's and handguns since I am former military. I'm looking for an entry-level bolt rifle, mostly for target use but which could also take a deer if I decide to start hunting. I'd prefer to spend $600-700 so that I have some cash left for good optics. I'm leaning toward .308 because ammo prices and recoil are reasonable. I try to avoid "exotic" rounds in my firearms.      I was originally leaning toward the Remington 700, but today I was reading up on the Tikka rifles and they seem to be getting pretty amazing reviews. I also like the Ruger compact series. It's a bit above my price range but if I decide it's the superior choice, I just might spring for it.      Any tips are appreciated. I'd prefer comments from folks who actually own a rifle of the sort I described, not someone like me who's just read a bunch of reviews. Thanks in advance!

20090225120247AAbIztZ	Sports;Basketball	Question for the big basketball fans...?	What gets you excited about basketball?    Ok let me explain...      I am a HUGE fan of hockey, football, and basketball. But I have never been able to sit down and watch, or go to a basketball game. It bores the crap outta me. To me, there is no excitement because I see the same thing back and forth... 2 points here, 2 points there, a 3 pointer... a big jump through the air dunk... its all the same and repetitive to me.       Now of course hockey has bang-bang plays, goals, power plays, big hits, shootouts, etc.    Baseball has home runs, stealing bases, pickles, bang-bang plays at the plate, etc.   And I don't even have to explain why football is exciting...      But what is it that you HUGE  basketball fans love so much about the sport? This is not a bashing thread on basketball, I actually would like to try and watch and get into the sport, but I just can't.       Discuss.

I have a "Watson Clark" Big League Chewing Gum baseball card and was wondering if anyone knew how much this card is worth? Or how much money I could get out of it?  It is in near-mint condition.  I've had it ever since I was a kid, and I know that some of those cards go for a lot of money.  It is number 17 out of a series of 240 cards.  I'm curious about how much it is worth, because I might be interested in selling it.  If anyone could tell me what its worth, or tell me where to find out how much its worth, I would appreciate it.        I also have the complete set of the 1991 Sporting News "Conlon Collection" baseball cards.  Its the set of all the old-time baseball players and they're all in black-and-white.  All of these cards are in near-mint to mint condition also.  Does anyone know what this whole set might be worth?  I have every card in the set, from 1 to 327.  Any input is appreciated.  Thank you.

20090226154215AAol2c8	Sports;Auto Racing;NASCAR	Is NASCAR trying to get rid of the 1 and 2 car teams?	The constant rule changes have all but rid NASCAR of the small teams.  with nothing but "impound" races the small teams must set the cars up for qualifing in order to make the big show, but then must try to find a window in order to make major adjustments just to try to be competitive.  With the cookie cutter cars, creativity and smarts can no longer help bridge the gap between the one and two car teams and the big team's money to afford the engines.  Also, rubbing is almost not tolerated anymore which eliminates the small teams from trying to better their position by anymeans other than finding a hole and squeezing through.  These factors also make it hard to find a decient sponsor becase it keeps them from being consistent and to even make every race on the schedual.  So while small teams are forced to merge to stay afloat, large teams continually add more cars, furthering their odds, and diminshing the posibility for the small teams to succed.  Will it ever stop?? Will NASCAR continue to be all about the money?? Why did NASCAR turn its back on its roots?      ps dont report this, everytime i say somethin negative about NASCAR someone has to be the person to report it and have it deleted, if u dont like what i have to say just move on and let it be                                              THANKS

20090226192242AAtrJb2	Sports;Cricket	Could staffing BCCI with upright former cricket players be a solution?	I am an Indian and proud of it. But being Indian for me has more to do with dedication, earnestness and honesty ! Qualities sadly lacking in the BCCI.       Hard to accept that everything Indian must be good as some people insist !       BCCI has some dishonest business at the very top.       One prime example Mr Lalit Modi, Chairman and Commissioner of Indian Premier League, Chairman of Champions League, President and Managing director Modi Enterprises, President of the Rajasthan Cricket Association, Vice President of BCCI, Vice President of Punjab Cricket Association, Executive Director of Godfrey Philips India and Director of Various Modi Group Companies.       He is responsible for alienating some great players like Kapil Dev.       An example of his criminal past:      Lalit Modi was charged and pleaded guilty to possession of 400 grams of cocaine, assault and kidnapping in 1985 while he was a student at Duke University, USA. He pleaded guilty on all charges and was sentenced to two years in prison. However, he did not serve any prison time and came back to India in 1986 after being released on probation.      In 2007 a PIL was filed in Mumbai High court challenging his position in BCCI on pretext of his criminal history. Though the court refused to unseat Modi, it asked the BCCI "to implement stringent regulatory measures so that those involved in criminal cases, not just illegal drugs but other serious charges have no place in administration".    **************************************...   Isnt it time something was done to rid of chaps like him from the BCCI ?      This ICL and IPL dichotomy has become a ludicrous imposition upon international cricket.      Staffing BCCI with upright former players IMO can improve it considerably.       Your opinion?

20090226175048AAxP5ZD	Sports;Outdoor Recreation;Camping	How does the Kabar Next Gen Knives Compare to the Original Kabar?	I have an original USN Kabar that one of my dad's friends in the military gave me.  It is the Iraqi Commemorative Version, and is a very beautiful knife.  He also gave me a display case for it, and I keep it there because I have several other fixed blades that I would rather use than the Kabar because I want it simply as a show knife.  I would like to get a Kabar to carry with me camping/hiking, and I was particularly looking at the Next Generation ones, straight edge with the plastic sheath.  I was wondering how this one is compared to the original, I know the original is 1095 carbon and the new one is 440A stainless but was wondering, other than steel type, if it still holds up to the Kabar legacy or if I should just get an original.

My question : is there a chance that some day, if we take into consideration the fact that Chris Benoit's brain was altered, as in a case of mental dementia, he would be declared unresponsible of his actions, and therefore not guilty ?      I'm not aware of how it works in the US, so I'm not sure if there's something similar to the article 122-1 of the french law, stating a person suffering from a severe mental illness making them not conscious of their acts cannot be judged, even if there is evidence of their crimes, just asking...      Of course I know it won't change anything regarding the victims of this tragedy, I'm just curious to know if this could happen.
