DSCxxxxx       This is a problem because if we ever want to put the new camera's photos into a folder with some really old ones taken with the older camera, they can't coexist unless we rename one of them.      Is there a way to change the naming system altogether?    The first camera is a Sony Cyber-Shot DSC-P200   The second is a Sony CyberShot DSC-T77      Thanks.      P.S. And out of curiosity, what happens when the photo number exceeds that of the digits? How do they name the 100000th photo?

The power supply was with the unit when I found it, (boxed up in the basement) so I'm pretty sure it was being used with it before, but I don't want to mess anything up. The jack fits the unit as well. Assuming the polarity is right, will this power supply work?

20090219202228AAGQsoz	Consumer Electronics;Other - Electronics	Why do cell-phone manufacturers make their phones with materials that get so slimy and full of fingerprints?	I've had my Samsung SGH-T439 flip phone for about six months now, and it's an exceptionally slimy phone - the design and materials used make it obvious upon first glance that it is full of fingerprints and oils from my hands. I know that cell-phone screens get slimy easily from being up against one's face, but on this phone, the FRONT COVER, as well as the keypad itself, show fingerprints and oil. Even after I clean it with alcohol, the moment a person touches it, it picks up the fingerprints again. It's exceptionally gross and annoying and I didn't have this slime/fingerprint problem with a previous flip phone.      Does anyone else have this problem with their phone? Why would a cell-phone manufacturer make such an slimy-looking phone? Is it really that difficult to use materials that hide fingerprints a bit?

Others say it doesn't matter, the time gained by letting the battery run all the way down and then charging it completely, is minimal.       Your thoughts plesae.

20090219200115AArKtPJ	Consumer Electronics;Cameras	What is a good USB night vision camera?	I am trying to set up a surveillance system to monitor the street in front of my house, but am not very familiar with camera equipment. I am looking for a night vision camera that can see down to the street (about 200 feet away) and has the resolution to get a decent video of the goings on. I don't need to get license plate expiration dates or anything like that, I just want to be able to see if anyone messes with my cars or litters. I'd like one that has a USB cable so I can simply plug it into my computer and record videos overnight directly onto my hard drive. I've read that IR cameras do not work well looking through windows so I'm thinking of just running the cord out my window and mounting the camera just below the window sill. I guess it would need to be weatherproof. Anyone have a camera they would recommend and why? And don't just type it in google (I've already done that) I want advice from someone that is actually knowledgeable about camera equipment and can recommend a specific camera. Thank you.

20090203105058AAOMnAt	Consumer Electronics;TVs	INSIGNIA TVs: CR Rates High, What's Your Opinion?	Going to buy a 26" or 32" for bedroom.      Looking for good quality and dependability mixed with a low price.  I know this is a Best Buy product.      Consumers Report (Oct '08) issue rates the Insignia LCD 26" as its Number 2 "Recommended" sets (Panasonic #1) Ahead of Sony, Samsung, RCA.      They rate the 32" model as a "5". Behind Samsung, Panasonic, Sony and Vizio (which they rate Best Buy)      Cnet review (can't see how recent) says the 26" Insignia is good.      I see a lot of comments in the completed answers on this, some going back several years. And some commenting on the poor quality of both Insignia and Vizio. (Others saying OK)      Anyone have RECENT experience with either Insignia or Vizio?      (I rate all answers if info is relevant and hopefully w/link)

I just got a cooling fan for the system and a charger for the wireless controllers which both run off of the two USB ports on the front of the system. But my Madcatz wireless controller needs one of the USB ports to be free so that i can put the wireless receiver into it (which BTW I think is so stupid of it and Sony needs to let us have an affordable controller). Thus I need a way to have more than 2 USB ports on the PS3. The only way i can think of is the use of a USB hub, does anyone know if that will work?      (side note: does anyone know if controllers in a charging dock will charge if the system is not on?)

20090219202223AAVEAaF	Consumer Electronics;Games & Gear;Xbox	Xbox 360 Hard Drive upgrade?	A friend of mine recently upgraded my 360's hard drive from a 20GB to a 120GB hard drive. The thing is that he did not purchase the "official" 360 120GB hard drive, he purchased a hard drive (the exact brand and model that Microsoft uses on their 360's) and replaced the 20GB with the new 120GB hard drive that he purchased from Newegg. What I wanted to know was if anybody has successfully been able to do the exact same thing and get Xbox Live to work. The reason I'm asking is because I saw an article a while back on a gaming site that talked about a guy who upgraded his Xbox 360 hard drive to an even bigger one, but didn't use the same brand and model hard drive that Microsoft uses. When he got on Live, he received a message from Microsoft stating that his Live account had been banned due to the upgrade and he was forced to go out and purchase a brand new 360. I'm afraid of this happening to me once I get on Live, but I figured if you use the same brand and model hard drive, it shouldn't make a difference. I just want this confirmed. Can someone confirm this?

I just got a digital converter box today (inexpensive one), and plugged my current "rabbit ear w/ loop" antenna to it, but when I did a channel scan, no channels were found.

I looked on the sony website, as well as best buy and others, and I have yet to see anything about nightshot. All i see is "steadyshot image stabilization".
