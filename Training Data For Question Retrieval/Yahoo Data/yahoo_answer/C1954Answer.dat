9bSCOZB1aa	www.gamemaker.nl<br>  <br>  This is the program you want. It's a free, simply game making program that you Can use for 3D, but the 3D will be challenging. It's a great program though, I used it for about a year and my friends been using it for a lot longer and he has done some really great stuff with it.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :D|`|KaMI67V4aa	dumb *** you can't unless you have a very good programming skills like architectural programming and animation programming<br>  <br>  but if you were prefering to a premade software theres a lot<br>  <br>  google is your friend...<br>  <br>  i hate stupid questions...|`|AA10567651	game makers a cheap. If you really want to learn how to make games, learn how to mod and program. The reason i said game makers are cheap is because you basically use preset object and dont really do anything original. Eveyone's game will have a simular character/item/weapon/etc.
9ko5WUFkaa	No - warranties cover for faults not caused by you.  they never cover for theft.<br>  <br>  If it is covered by your insurance they may pay to replace it - you'd have to check your policy or contact you insurance provider.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	No, warranty won't cover theft, insurance will if you got insurance.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	no im pretty sure it only covers malfunctions of the ipod caused by the company if it gets stolen its not their fault to replace it|`|BqXSymxjaa	No, insurance is for theft. A warranty is if it gets broken or stops working and they will either fix it for free or replace it.|`|iAFQPknoaa	No for sure.  But if you bought it with a credit card, the card company might.  It's worth a phone call (which is VERY important to them).|`|8FiJ5i81aa	probably not call and ask but i doubt it. mayb with a police report|`|TIsgCnhkaa	No, the warranty covers damages like hardware failure, and other things that are not your fault, but the fault of the apple company.<br>  <br>  This circumstance would not fall under the "covered" category.<br>  <br>  so sorry.|`|NBT5PoRVaa	what do you think?<br>  if it did cover it you could simply have your friend "steal" it and tell apple to replace it. <br>  sorry but the answer is no. those ipods cost so much too.|`|9bSCOZB1aa	I HIGHLY doubt it. The warranties mainly cover things that the iPod did to itself - software/hardware issues, defects, etc. Not so much things that were your own responsibility.|`|4t2rM4raaa	^ is correct.

6489dd6288438d0ac1d6bd81b79f0d8daa	Honestly, for that amount of money (or even less) you can buy a brand new dSLR, with better features and better image quality than the E-500 (especially in regards to ISO capability).<br>  <br>  I recommend you have a look at either Canon or Nikon when considering a dSLR.|`|EamhENYJaa	The best thing to do would be to look on eBay to see what other people are selling the camera for.<br>  14-45 lenses aren't standard so I don't know which camera brand you have. I assume it is digital as you mention the USB cable. In DSLRs the technology is changing very fast so $625 is probably expensive for a semi-obsolete camera as for that amount you can get a new one.|`|1F6KJt0oaa	There are a ton of DSLR's out there that you can pick up now for that money.  Pentax K2000, K200D and possibly even a K20D used for that.  Or one of those other brands.  Yeah get a new one or newer used camera.  The problem is Digital SLR cameras have limited shutter lives.  They are rated for so many shots before they will die.  The older a camera is the more likely it is to be approaching its lifespan.  3 years old isn't that old really but think about how much has come out in those three years and how far the prices have come down.  For how much she paid for it I could see it being hard for her to part with it in good shape for less than half of what she paid for it, but on your side there are higher end new cameras available for less money.|`|xG5ZlJDqaa	vague. The slr can be anything from the old Canon rebel to the Nikon D2s. Have no idea what you're talking about when you say 14-45 and a 45-150 lens. I know the focal lengths, but nothing about the brand and model.|`|b3a4e3954118fb9fef3e435ed488eeadaa	If you add the model of camera we can be of more help to you. $625 seems like a lot of money to pay an aunt for a camera. Look yp the model of the camera online and check  if there are complaints or recalls on it. Look at the instruction manual and see if it's going to serve your needs.  Do you NEED the camera or do you just want it.  Check ebay or used camera online shops and see what they are going for. I think the price is too high. Caveat emptor & good luck..|`|TbTO5SXlaa	The price is way too high for a 3 yr. old Olympus.<br>  <br>  For $699.99 you can buy the Sony A300 with the 18-70mm and 55-200mm zoom lenses at <a href="http://www.bhphotovideo.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bhphotovideo.com</a> The A300 with just the 18-70mm zoom is $599.99<br>  <br>  Sony has their version of Image Stabilization (IS) in the camera body so any lens you use will be an IS lens. Canon and Nikon have their versions of IS in some of their lenses but not every lens. Plus, you get to pay for the IS with every lens.<br>  <br>  The A300 also has Live View which works with the auto focus. So if you're in a crowd and need to hold the camera over your head to get a picture just flip the screen down and you can compose, check focus and shoot.<br>  <br>  The Sony DSLR cameras can use every Minolta Maxxum AF lens made since 1985 so you have a wide selection of lenses. Plus, with the in-camera IS even a 20 yr. old Maxxum AF 300mm lens will be an IS lens.|`|AA12133586	well depend on the model of the SLR really..  but seriously 625 you can get a new slr like the nikon d40 kit

Xxviy63Paa	Anybody who has played multiplayer games online for the last few years knows those types are all over the place. On a game server, they are isolated to that server, so they are just a temporary nuisance, either they're voted off or there's other servers where you can avoid them. And passworded servers exclude them entirely. <br>  <br>  But in Home, they are all literally dumped in one place. And it is a place where there is practically nothing at all to do. The vast majority of gamers are dudes and aren't interested in hanging out and talking - unless it happens to be a girl. Nobody else really bothers to spend any time at Home. Hate to say it but it's boring as hell, except for red bull air race.<br>  <br>  I figured Home was in danger of being a 3D MySpace, and I suspected that was the real reason it took so long to release it. It's still not done yet, of course. They won't be able to release the full game until there are so many regular people there that the pervs who congregate will no longer be the only ones with anything to do, so they won't be in the majority anymore.<br>  <br>  A lot of the pervs don't care about gender, either... anyone, male or female, who dozes off for a few minutes invariably ends up with a whole stack of dudes humping on their avatar. A dude who doses off on a bench may find a dude face-planting in his lap.  Those bastards long ago, in the closed beta, figured out which poses can be made obscene, how to go around in groups and block someone in so they can't move, and so forth. That's mostly just joking around but just like MySpace there are some genuine stalkers there. There just has to be. It's like their dream come true.<br>  <br>  I'm not totally sure but I think you have to be 18 to use Home. Of course not everyone there is, which is why Sony is still far away from releasing the final version. What they need to do is put more games in there. Make it more like video games. Let avatars jump and let there be areas where you can fight, or run around and find things. make it more like LBP. Then the normal people will show up and crowd out all the pervs.<br>  <br>  They can't learn anything about you if you don't tell them, though... but if you tell anything to somebody, they can find out from them, and watch your word balloon too... so you pretty much have to not tell any personal info to anybody there.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	fag11's right|`|1WgOj89kaa	It's the same as any online feature, as long as you be sensible and dont give out your personal details, it is perfectly safe.

On the cheap you could look at the boston horizon series 5.1 about $250 on amazon, I have heard all three, none of them have a huge over powering sub, at least don't come with one, but all have a very good sound to them  and will really throw the sound around, the good new is you can always upgrade the sub later without a total overhaul like you would have to do with the bose, reason #1000 not to get the bose system.<br>  <br>  By the way if you have some extra cash look at Orb audio, very cool|`|I91lFgTdaa	Ok well it sounds like you have a good set up.<br>  <br>  For Speakers I would Recommend Polk Audio, Klipsch, Yamaha.<br>  <br>  They have Good Quility Speaker and have a Great Price.<br>  <br>  Price can go as low as $200 to Bose's Value depending on model.<br>  <br>  Also Speaker wires might be need to be replaced too.

EFz2Y9jZaa	Generally speaking most phones (except sony ericssons) take micro SD's but it will probably have a maximum capacity, like 4GB or 8GB, I would suggest just putting a 2GB and see how you go.<br>  <br>  I had a quick look and saw this was released in 2007 so there is a small chance it may take a mini SD not a micro so see if you have find a 3in1 memory card set, they come with both a normal SD, a mini and a micro.
a8hbGnlOaa	no you dont there is other ways to put music on your phone one is with this product (<a href="http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Aluratek-MicroSD-MiniSD-USB2.0-Multi-Media-Card-Reader/2637763/product.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.overstock.com/Electronics/Alu...</a> )<br>  the other is the usb unless you want to pay for it threw your phone but the other 2 ways just drag and drop into the folder called music on your memory card or download vcast music with rhapsody if you get the usb they are like 10 bucks in small cellphone stores like 30 at verizon but the verizon one comes with the program so there is no need to look it up and download either way you can find the program for free online

eVptHOOBaa	Well, first of all when you load your films into the tanks for development, make sure you do it correctly, so that it does not stick to.... oh... wait!!! It's digital! You don't process those in tanks... sorry.... :)<br>  <br>  Anyway, you've read it all correctly, except you missed the part when some people say they are ghosts, or troubled souls, or extraterrestrial creatures not seen by naked eye, or our reflections from parallel worlds, or heck knows what else!<br>  <br>  To be able to judge what it really is, it would help us if you uploaded a sample somewhere and added a link to the question, then we'd be able to tell what they are. But most likely, this is dust in the air that gets badly out of focus and is exposed very brightly right in front of the lens by the flash that is physically located right next to it. This is called bokeh, when a very tiny object that is severely out of focus is seen by camera as a huge fuzzy circle. But to tell for sure - we need to see!<br>  <br>  If it was a manufacturer defect, you should expect to see the exact same spots in exactly the same places on all photographs. If they move around from shot to shot - it's most likely dust.<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|WOiH4CGvaa	I know exactly what your talking about, but I don't know the cause. <br>  <br>  Silly story, but, while we were remodeling a 200 year old house, One of the guys decided to take pictures. In every shot there were lots of bubbles, like actual bubbles! It was really weird! <br>  <br>  However, with the ghost thing in mind, I got my camera out, and took some shots too! No bubbles. We both took shots at the same time, bubbles for him, none for me.<br>  <br>  So I'd suggest it has something to do with your camera, some sort of lens flare maybe. I wish I could help, really! But reading your question just reminded me of that incident.|`|j7rBM2yTaa	As LEM said, you'd need to upload a sample picture to get a good diagnosis.<br>  <br>  The fact that you only see this problem with the flash suggests that there might be particles of dust in the way - perhaps inside the camera. My camera has problems with dust particles on the sensor but it has a removable lens and so swapping lenses causes this. I have to clean the sensor from time to time.<br>  <br>  Try taking a picture of a blank white wall or up into a cloudless blue sky and then examining the photo for small dark blobs that are always in the same place<br>  <br>  The other possibility is that the spots you are seeing are "noise" from the sensor. Some digital cameras can be set to very high ISO values (1600 to 3200). Most pictures are taken at around ISO 200, so if your camera's ISO is not on auto and is set very high, you will get random coloured spots on the photos - but I don't think these would look like your "bubbles".|`|1F6KJt0oaa	Really depends on what you are talking about.  It could be dead pixels, it could be excessive noise, it could be bugs getting caught in the flash, dust being caught in the flash, reflections off stuff in the air, reflections off something on the ground.  Basically it depends on what kind of spots you are talking about.
BYHmKxpdaa	Yes you can. On Alltel, you can even do it over their website. You should check Verizon's website.

W9IdT8zdaa	All digital movie cameras have an output socket for a cable called IEEE 1394, commonly known as 'Firewire'. Check your camera's instruction book.  Your laptop will have an input socket for it as well, but there are different types of sockets, so make sure the cable you buy fits both camera and computer. Use this to download the movie picture and sound. Microsoft loads a basic Movie Maker program with their operating software, but if you want to do more editing, there are programs available for around $100 or more. These allow you to edit the movie, add titles and sound if you wish and burn it to DVD.

Y  SALUDOS <br>  <br>  Roaming es un concepto utilizado en comunicaciones inalámbricas que está relacionado con la capacidad de un dispositivo para moverse de una zona de cobertura a otra. Es una palabra de procedencia inglesa que significa vagar o rondar. El término más adecuado en castellano es "itinerancia".<br>  <br>  El concepto de roaming, cuando es utilizado en las redes Wi-Fi, significa que el dispositivo Wi-Fi cliente puede desplazarse e ir registrándose en diferentes bases o puntos de acceso.<br>  <br>  En telefonía móvil, el roaming es la capacidad de hacer y recibir llamadas en redes móviles fuera del área de servicio local.<br>  <br>  <br>               El servicio de Roaming <br>  <br>  <br>  El servicio de roaming ha hecho posible que los usuarios de telefonía móvil adquieran una completa libertad de movimiento entre las áreas de cobertura de las diferentes empresas de telecomunicaciones.<br>  <br>  Este servicio consiste en permitir que un usuario reciba las llamadas hechas hacia su número de móvil sin necesidad de realizar ningún tipo de procedimiento extra y en algunos casos, permitirle efectuar llamadas hacia la zona donde se contrató originalmente el servicio sin necesidad de hacer una marcación especial.<br>  <br>  El servicio de roaming es posible gracias a la constante comunicación entre las diferentes estaciones base que controlan cada célula de cobertura y el teléfono móvil. A medida que el teléfono pasa de un área de cobertura con una clave de larga distancia diferente, el teléfono cambia automáticamente la frecuencia de transmisión y recepción para adaptarse a los requerimientos de frecuencias de cada zona. Al recibir una se?alización que corresponde a otra zona, el teléfono efectúa la petición de roaming a la estación más cercana, enviando su número de identificación y el identificador de zona asignado originalmente. La estación base responderá con la se?alización necesaria para ajustar los requerimientos de transmisión de la trama en dicha zona; al mismo tiempo, la estación base informara a la central telefónica hacia que región deberá redirigir la llamada para el número de móvil que solicitó el roaming.<br>  <br>  El costo de transferencia de cada llamada y los costos de interconexión serán cargados al receptor de la llamada haciendo que el servicio sea transparente para el usuario que desea contactar un número que se desplaza a otra zona.<br>  <br>  <br>  [editar] Roaming (Itinerancia) en Redes Wi-Fi<br>  Para que sea posible, tiene que haber una peque?a superposición (overlapping) en las coberturas de los Access Point, de tal manera que los usuarios puedan desplazarse por las instalaciones y siempre tengan cobertura. Los Access Point incorporan un algoritmo de decisión que decide cuando una estación debe desconectarse de un Punto de Acceso y conectarse a otro|`|e7dfaca796ba7011cce2eb8eaf82dc4daa	EL SERVICIO ROAMING, EN UN CELULAR, SIGNIFICA, QUE PODES USARLO Y COMUNICARTE, EN LUGARES FUERA DE LA JURISDICCIóN ADONDE HABITUALMENTE TE DESENVOLVES.

8a6510cff9320c88e7a7b69ec53fc060aa	This depends on your phone company. A lot of companies will "lock" your phone, making it impossible to gets songs except straight from them.<br>  <br>  To get songs from your phone company, you have to log onto the internet browser and then go to where it says you can DL songs. Be aware that being on the internet costs money (it will usually warn you before logging in) and songs also cost money. Typically they are around $1-5.<br>  <br>  If your phone is not locked, you can get an adapter to hook your phone up to your computer and I believe it comes with software. I believe your phone supports Mp3s so that makes it easier. Unfortunately the cord adapter is usually kind of expensive and you can't tell if your phone is locked until you try (as far as I've seen).<br>  <br>  You can also look for websites that allow you to send yourself songs. <a href="http://mobile17.com/" rel="nofollow">http://mobile17.com/</a>  works quite well, but if you are just using a free account you will have wait times.<br>  This will send you a song and it will give you an email with a link.

780f84c5c601e243eb7cb95bb3e08971aa	I think it's a pretty fair price what it is right now.  I mean, it has the same capasity as an iPod Nano which is $200.  Plus, it's a highly advanced 2MP camera phone (those can easily run for $150 by themselves).  And then, it has all these advanced features like like a mini Mac (web; widgets that show stocks, weather, maps, and more; photo galleries)<br>  <br>  I personally don't have the $600 cash to get one, but if I did and I needed a new phone, I would highly consider the iPhone.

AA11235545	I've had this problem multiple times. There are two things I would try. First, check the version of Itunes you have on your ipod. This information can be found by going to settings on your main menu screen on your ipod then clicking about. Scroll down to where it says version and it will say something like 1.0 or 1.2. You want to make sure you have the latest version of Itunes because apple has rigged it so that the only way you can use docking stations and other new ipod hardware is by having updated itunes software. Luckily, if you don't have the latest version of itunes you can download it at the apple website or right in your itunes library for free. The other thing I would try is resetting the ipod. Sometimes my ipod nano freaks out especially when I hook it up to someone Else's computer. However, after I reset it, it works fine. To reset your ipod nano, toggle the hold button at the top on and off. After you switch the hold on and off several times hold down both the center button and the menu button at the same time. This will reset your ipod and unless it is seriously damaged this will get it working again.<br>  <br>  P.S. You should reset your ipod only as a last resort because doing so could potentially erase all of the songs and other things you've loaded onto your ipod. It has never erased mine and you should be OK but just in case be sure you only reset it when you absolutely need to. Good luck!|`|9147Wtopaa	That happened to me once. i left it alone for 3 weels and it turned on later.|`|29iw2n9jaa	could be coropeted try holding the middle button for about a min should help email me a t livin_long_Ago2@yahoo.com for more help|`|up5yrvc5aa	Toggle the hold switch (move it back a forth one or two times) then press and hold the menu and center/select button, until the apple comes up.

However, the PS3 has an integrated blue ray player. This in turn could save you quite a bit of money considering blue-ray players are quite pricey at this point in time. Both good choices but personally I would go for the 360 cheaper+less bugs<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|KnKN5D0Xaa	I really think ps3 is better since its more new than xbox360|`|o4I0ShBWaa	When it comes to flashy technology, PS3 wins the day with the blu-ray drive and the Built-in Wi-fi.  But I think the Xbox 360 is a better buy because it it cheaper and much faster.<br>  <br>  The PS3 has a single 3.2 GHz Cell Processor and six or seven "backup" processors which are rarely used.  Many game programmers and designers complain that the Cell architecture on the PS3 is so complicated that most people don't want to make games for the PS3.<br>  <br>  The Xbox 360 has 3 3.2GHz Processors and double the RAM (ability of the system to utilize more active information at once).  The Xbox 360 also has many exclusive games for it, such as the Halo series, Gears of War, etc.<br>  <br>  The Xbox also has much better online play, if it does cost some, whereas the PS3 online play is very buggy.  Many games that come out are usually considered better on the Xbox 360 than the PS3 (ex. Oblivion, Splinter Cell:Double Agent, Ghost Recon: Advanced Warfighter).<br>  <br>  The "amazing" SIXAXIS controller for the PS3 is one of the most un-ergonomic controllers out there, and is supposed to be special because it has completely un-utilized motion sensors, whereas the Xbox 360 has an incredibly ergonomic design as well as more features than the PS3 controller.<br>  <br>  Finally, the price: the PS3 is $600, wheras the Xbox 360 is $300-$480, depending on the one you get.  I suggest the $480 Xbox 360 Elite, especially if you have an HDTV.<br>  <br>  Pretty much, the Xbox 360 delivers well, is faster, and has more exclusive and better games.  Remember that a console is only as good as its games.

WynAkGxzaa	in my view, its ipod.. it is thinner than zune and zune has no impact, it looks like a blackboard eraser... larger screen doesn't mean greater resolution, bothe have the same resolution, it means, they have the same video/image quality... and the zune doesn't have the click wheel so it is harder to navigate.. and about the software, itunes is better than the zune software...|`|BxgL62Nyaa	dont get both of them. just get a phone with all the cool stuff.|`|52d3b4048eeabd9f0da43eacc8bcdbbdaa	I like the zune better than the ipod....

If you have a pkg for txt, they will not change that until you renew the contract.  They just changed the per msg usage charge.|`|3Bp4wQSeaa	It is not a breach of contract if you were paying for texting as you go vs. having a text plan.  The provider would have had to have it noted on your bill under "important information..." or "Information you should know"....   prior to the change in rates.  Call customer care and ask them when this change was implemented.  Good Luck|`|a7Dl5detaa	No. Now If You Had A Text Message Plan They Can't Change The Monthly Price Unless You Change Which Plan You Have.<br>  <br>  IE I Have Had TMobile Internet Package For $4.99 And They Changed It To $5.99 About 2 Years Ago But I Still Pay $4.99
AA11042749	No you cannot. Each phone is programmed for a specific carrier.  You will not be able to interchange them. Also, some carriers use sim card technology (Cingular), while others don't use them (Verizon Wireless).|`|Z5IxPHSgaa	nope sure can not

I am assuming that this is for a child because the description makes it seem that way.<br>  If the price is right, doesn't seem like a bad deal and no, it won't be hard to learn how to download music onto it.<br>  Yeah, at that price it definitely sounds like a kid's toy.<br>     You might want to consider local stores like Radio Shack, Best Buy, even Walmart. They all probably have something that will fit your style and  budget. Two of the biggest advantages of buying local, as opposed to  online in a situation such as yours are:<br>  1) You have someone in the store who can show you right there how to use it. Even though most come with good manuals, it is still comforting to have the salesperson demonstrate it for you and answer any questions face to face.<br>  2) If you have any problems with it (and small electronics seem to have more than their share) it is easy to take it back for service and/or exchange.<br>  You can always check out ratings of various brands online, but for the few bucks you may save by buying online may not be worth the headaches for any problems down the road.<br>  Especially if you are not electronically oriented, as you seem to indicate in your question. <br>  Good luck in finding what you want.

fYBVJHYoaa	If you requested a change previously, to start today at 12am, you'll first need to power the phone down if texting was a feature that you weren't previously subscribed to.  Once you power it back on, you can verify it's working without touching the package by sending the word 'test' to the number 151; if you receive a response that says 'Thank you for choosing Cingular (or AT&T), text messaging is working for your account.', you're set to go.  If not, wait til morning and call in and make sure the change took effect, if it didn't, that'd be the reason.

Buying in the store might have a warranty you could get. You can also ask the people in the store any questions you want while you're there, instead of having to ask them over the phone, when sometimes they answer your question completely wrong.|`|AA12236650	You usually get a warranty at the retail store. Also, it makes it easier to contact who you bought it from if something goes wrong.|`|685ed4af8867fe554f1983939d72f575aa	If you buy it online and want to return it, you have to ship it back, which is a PITA.

You can't return an online phone to the store though.<br>  <br>  But you do get better prices online, plus Instant rebates as opposed to Mail in Rebates.<br>  <br>  The people who are saying you don't get a warranty if you buy online are WRONG. You get a 1 yr warranty no matter where you buy it from.<br>  <br>  And to activate a phone you buy online, you call CS 1-800 number they give you in the box and that's it.

2d04438f73a77907a3eb7c42a2ea9260aa	Samsung reinforces its technology leadership by launching the world's first 10 megapixel mobile phone (model: SCH-B600) in Korean market.<br>  <br>  Samsung reached another milestone in camera phones by launching 10 megapixel camera phone, which was unveiled at CeBIT in March this year. Samsung has been the first to introduce mobile phone with embedded camera in 2000. Samsung has also launched the world's first 5 megapixel camera phone in October 2004 ; the world's first 7 megapixel camera phone in July 2005.<br>  <br>  Samsung's 10 megapixel camera phone (SCH-B600) is 6mm thinner and 10g lighter than the 7 megapixel camera phone (SCH-V770) and sets itself apart from its previous megapixel camera phones by combining mobile TV capability in Satellite standard.<br>   <br>   <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  The B600 offers the same level of picture-taking sophistication that a 10 megapixel digital camera offers. The camera function includes 3x optical zoom and 5x digital zoom. It also has auto focus and a flash unit that performs optimally for 10 megapixel photographs.<br>  <br>  Also, the B600 comes fitted with a LED autofocus feature which assists users to capture clear, crisp photos even in dark settings. Located next to the lens, the LED autofocus automatically determines the distance and utilizes the appropriate focus setting for optimal photo shooting.<br>  <br>  The B600 also supports white balance, manual focus, continuous picture-taking, and interval picture-taking functions.<br>  <br>  It also supports Bluetooth which enables users to send pictures wirelessly to other mobile phones, printers or to Bluetooth headsets.<br>  <br>  The high color Reproduction TFT-LCD produces the highest possible display for its size. The photo-fine chromic LCD can reproduce 16 million colors, virtually any color found in nature, earning it the "True Color" appellation. Moving pictures can be recorded in QVGA resolution at 15-30 frames per second. Users can watch live TV in crisp picture through Satellite DMB function.<br>  <br>  It also supports external memory (MMCmicro) in addition to its internal memory. The mobile phone supports a TV-out function where users can connect their phones to view still or motion pictures.<br>  <br>  The B600 comes with a design reminiscent of a real digital camera. The front is designed as a bar-type mobile phone, while the back side is used as the digital camera.<br>  <br>  Other advanced functions in the B600 include an MP3 player, business card reader, and 128 polyphonic sounds.<br>  <br>  The price of B600 is around 900,000 won (about $ 900) in Korea.<br>  <br>  SCH-B600 Specifications<br>   <br>  Standard  CDMA 2000 1X EVDO (800 MHz) <br>   <br>  Camera  10 Megapixel Camera  <br>   <br>  Display  2.2" 240x320 16M Color TFT LCD <br>   <br>  Features  Mobile TV (Satellite Digital Multimedia Broadcasting )<br>  Video Recording & Messaging (MPEG4 / H.264)<br>  MP3/ AAC / AAC+ <br>  Dual Speaker / Anycall Band <br>  Bluetooth?

AA11042749	To cancel VZW, you will be charged 175.00 PER line to cancel  the contract. To cancel the account, you can go into any VZW store, however, I worked for cust svc for 3 years and I have found that you are MUCH better off calling 1-800-922-0204 and choosing option 2 (disconnect).  By choosing option 2, that will route your call to the home call center, and they can arrange for a disconnect. The wait times for a home call center usually is not that bad! This is what you do if you DON'T want to keep your cell phone numbers when you move to T-Mobile. <br>  <br>  Now, if you are wanting to disconnect, but want to keep your phone numbers (called porting numbers), you don't want to cancel your service at all with VZW.  You will go to T-Mobile and they will put in a request to "take over your numbers" (porting), and then when the port request is completed (can take 1 hr up to 48 hours), the contracts at VZW will cancel upon completion of the port.  Once the phones are canceled on the VZW side, they will send you a final bill that will include all outstanding charges.|`|NMxzftgWaa	If you are transferring your numbers to T-Mobile then you just have to go to T-Mobile and they will port your numbers.  Your service automatically cancels with Verizon Wireless when the numbers are released to T-Mobile.  The early termination fees are $175 per line that is canceled.  <br>  <br>  When you process the port out requests at T-Mobile, make sure they put in the port requests for your secondary lines first and the primary line last.  Since you have a family share plan, if the primary tries to port first it will cause an error and delay the whole process.  <br>  <br>  If you are not taking  your phone numbers with you (not porting them), then you will have to contact Verizon Wireless to terminate your service either by phone or in one of the company owned stores.
AA11042749	If you haven't changed the security code, it is usually set to 0000.  However, if you have changed it, you will have to take it back to a local store so that the phone can be either reprogrammed or flashed (depends on your cell provider)...
AA11042749	The V-Cast V-Pak is a feature that enables you to have unlimted airtime for Get-it-now applications and also allows unlimited airtime for Mobile Web.  This feature is strictly voluntary, and can be cancelled at anytime.  When you purchased your phone, you were given the feature free for 30 days and then you were required to call cust svc if you wanted to cancel.  If you want to cancel, you can call *611 from your cell or 1-800-922-0204 from a landline phone.|`|sTNxxUp5aa	its enabling vcast (video clips, music, internet) so just cancel it if u dont want it|`|vf1NorKuaa	V Cast is the high speed application that enables you to download and access videos, music and news at faster speeds.  If you did not know that it was on your bill, I would suggest that you call Verizon and ask them to credit your account.  Chances are the sales person that signed you up probably added a "1 month free" feature on your phone and failed to mention to you that you needed to cancel before the 30 days to avoid being charged.

They will verify your name, cell phone #, and the last 4 of the SSN (or passcode if there is one on the acct).  That is all that is needed for an associate to access your account.  If you are not on the account, you will have to have the account holder or an authorized user to call them.
AA11042749	If the phone is on the lost or stolen list, you will not be able to activate that phone until the owner calls VZW and removes it from the list.  You can call 1-800-922-0204 and have an associate look it up for you to make sure. If the phone is not on the list, you will then be able to activate it on your account without any problems.|`|NMxzftgWaa	If the phone is on the lost/stolen list then it cannot be activated.  Is your friend the person who reported it stolen/lost?  If they are, then they can contact customer service and it can be deleted from the lost/stolen list.  Otherwise, unless you know the original owner and they are willing to have it removed from that list, the phone will not be able to be activated.

AA11042749	They will install the card software onto your computer and provide you with the card.  You will then have to get a 2 yr contract with VZW just for the card.  The price per month for the service is 79.99.  You would be able to either bring your cell service over to VZW or just have the card service.  The V740 is only compatible with VZW, just in case that was not disclosed to you.  The card can be used for more than 2 yrs, however, you would be required to sign a 2 yr agreement for the card.  If you cancel the service on the card before the 2 yrs is up, you would then be required to pay the early termination fee which is up to 175.00..just depends on the amount of time left on the contract.
AA11042749	Just because you are leaving your home calling area doesn't mean extra charges.  VZW offers nationwide coverage with no roaming on all of their new plans.  If you have upgraded your service plan within the last 2 years, you will not have to worry.  If the phone works, you can use it.  If your plan is more than 2 years old, you will need to contact cust svc (*611 send) to see what your plan offers.  This is only true within the US.  If you are going to Canada or any other foreign country, this does not apply.|`|5b90bc866933aa473f3c30b1a379fc07aa	Verizon has a good map of their service area, better check it out if you don't have your phone set to notify you when you leave service area.|`|51744399b8b2819fb6c8ca7ea7e8073daa	WHAT|`|5eeb97b1f3f13888b0c795d4c53b638eaa	Im pretty sure only if you made any calls. that would be long distance. if you dont have a long distance plan, you would probably be charged for how many minutes you used.

AA11042749	You need to call customer service and they can switch your plan.  If you call prior to the bill cycle date, they are usually able to backdate the feature so that you would have the unlimited txt all month.  For some reason they are unable to backdate, they are trained to help you so that you won't have to pay overage charges.. there are many things that they can do to help!|`|3NGLDXNEaa	Best thing to do is to just wait till your bill cycle date to make any switches so that you wont see any additional charges. If you were to make the changes now then you would probably see some overage charges for text messaging since it would be prorated. So if I was you I would just wait till the end of your month and it will be an easy switch over. If you know you are gonna go over the text then you can switch it. Of course you will be charged for any overage, but it might be worth it cause if you go over your 250 now by a lot  then it may be more expensive.  I hope I was able to help you and good luck.|`|KRY2iF4gaa	I use to have Verizon.

Dial *611 and tell the customer service representative that you have the 250 plan, but you'd like the unlimited one instead, and ask them to back-date it.  If you say you've never done this before, apologize, and say you would greatly appreciate it, the representative will definitely do it.  I accidentally went over my minutes by 1,500 one month, and I just called and asked them to back-date a different plan for me.  They did it, no problem!

Remember, if you go online, all rebates are instant.|`|Vu24e6taaa	It all depends on where you buy it. For exp. online and corporate stores prices are about the same but if u go to indirect stores or kiosks the prices will vary
AA11042749	There are many different unlimited plans.  There is unlimited within the VZW network with so many to other carriers.. 5.00 - 20.00 per month.  They also have a new completely unlimited plan that is around 20.00 per month.  Just call cust svc (*611 send) and they can give you all of the options in detail and add it on your account for you.|`|4396901ff619939228f66190dbd7da81aa	I believe that it is only $5
AA11042749	I can't personally help you to fix it.. you have to take the phone into a local VZW store that has a technician and they can look at it for you.  They won't charge anything to look at it, and should not charge much, if anything, to fix it regardless of insurance or not.
AA11042749	Actually, you can go through MY ACCOUNT at VZW.com and you will get "backup assistant".  Once you have activated backup assistant, you can transfer all of your contacts yourself from your home.  Of course, you can go to the store, but they will charge you $10.00 to do the switch.  If you need help with backup assistant, call 1-800-922-0204, from a phone other than your cell, and choose the option for technical support and they will help you set it up. By the way, backup assistant is free to use..|`|t562uTmMaa	Try putting your old sim card into your new phone.|`|e412551d6c02320bcec6f322a94b18bbaa	Verizon doesn't use sim cards.  They are a CDMA provider, not GSM or iDEN.  I don't understand why Duane thinks every company uses sim cards.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but the only quick way to do it is to take both phones into a Verizon store and have them transfer them.  The only other thing you can do it enter them one by one.  That's one reason I'll never use a CDMA provider.
AA11042749	VZW charges .15 cents.  Phonezoo has their own fees that they charge you.|`|o2Pw7cy2aa	It is 15 cents

AA11042749	1.  Any messages that are sent or received will be subtracted from your monthly allowance.  You can keep track of those on your cell for free by calling #DATA send.  VZW will send you a free text telling you how many you have sent and received...<br>  2. If you send the same message to 10 different people, it is the same as sending 10 messages..  Every message in and out per phone # counts as a message..|`|AA10729876	every time u send a message or answer a message it's a charge, limit the texts, they don't tell you this, but there are plans that they have  that may cost you a little extra that they don't advertise, call customer help about up to date plans|`|Y8NEstgAaa	the number of your total messages goes down for every message you send or recieve....  and if you send the same message to ten people it counts as ten messages|`|wUcKWB7Waa	I am a Verizn user but I;m not allowed to text... :o(|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	Any message that your receive or send is going to count as one, just like voicemail. I'm not sure about the sending the same message to 10 people. Verizon has a website. You should go there and see if you can find out about the last question.

Try it again later & it should work.
m2zvAaHpaa	If you haven't already, try pressing the top of the navigation wheel at the same time as the center. Hold it like this for about 5 seconds or so, and the iPod should "reboot". You'll know it's long enough if it goes dark and then you see the Apple logo. Wait a few seconds and it should start up again. If it's messed up beyond where that will work, then you probably have to get it fixed, or replace it.

The guy above me is right, but definitely call first because if you open your ipod your warranty is void regardless then try it even though you'll probably  end up breaking it.

AA10013765	I believe that there are smart phone programs that will do this. But you'll still have to pay your carrier for the data connection and dedicate a cell phone to it. <br>  <br>  The device must send data, typically via cellular carrier, so there really isn't any way around this cost.|`|6ae538316a7fd2814b825a4b80688256aa	i guess there are gps tracker without monthly fee . you may want to visit  88db website
lJAaBmlyaa	Don't feel bad all wireless customers are the same way. People have such unrealistic expectations of the wireless industry.The thing that kills me is when a customer damages their phone and wants to know why we won't give them one for free. Also, complaining about dropped calls is a mute point in my mind. I've been with all the major carrier except sprint and guess which one had the most dropped calls and the highest bills... Verizon! That's why i laugh to myself when people say they are going to leave for Verizon. Last, but not least it kills me when people don't want to troubleshoot their phone. Yes it's sucks when your phone doesn't work, but most of the time it's something that we can fix if you can press a couple buttons in your phone for us. We cannot see what is on the screen of your phone, we do not make the phones nor do we have a magic wand or button to press to fix the phone and in your contract that you never read and signed blindly at your own free will it states that we cannot guarantee service and that troubleshooting is required.|`|uX5hO3d8aa	I'm a spoiled AT&T customer and I love it. That's why I stay with AT&T.    If I have a charge on my account that I don't like, I call AT&T and they remove it.     But I always act respectful, especially when dealing with you agents in person. Impolite customers don't deserve special treatment.

I would never go back.|`|wJB5h4twaa	Jailbreaking is basically taking your iTouch and hacking it so that you can customize it.

You can even use it to view/control your computer.<br>  <br>  The possibilities are endless.. okay maybe they have an end, but its way better than what apple gives us.<br>  <br>  I would highly recommend it!

raEUval8aa	No. The PS3 graphics are still leagues ahead of PS2 graphics, on any TV.|`|1HtTxOOQaa	The graphics are better than PS2 but a PS3 on Full HD would simply blow the graphics of a SDTV. I initially used a normal wire to play MGS4 and the game looked much more better than a PS2 game but, as soon as I switched to a HD wire and FULL HD, the games absolutely blew my mind.|`|6rxhges4aa	although the graphics will be smoother and faster than the ps2 visually you would have to strain your eyes a bit to define any noticeable difference in definition between the images on a SDTV.    the picture quality will be largely down to the quality of your tv set-if you have a cheap and nasty telly you will end up with a cheap and nasty image regardless of what console or cables you are using and no amount of tweaking will improve the picture-the only conventional set (CRT) i would even consider plugging a ps3 into is phillips pixel-+ series (32")-the image quality on these sets is almost 3D like-so grab one of these if you can't afford an HD set (they can be had for 200 2nd hand) and you won't be dissapointed at the graphics.|`|a5gAwH4Laa	the ps3 still has better graphics than a ps2 on a normal tv  it just looks nowhere near as good as one with a hdmi cable and hdtv|`|JG7W0qvcaa	Buy A Ps3      Woo Hoo    Go Ps3's    Woop Woop They Rock ;)|`|vUccHCMPaa	No way the ps3 has better graphics than the ps2 with or without HD.

If it comes up with an error message saying IP address cannot be assigned, then create your own one manually. Something along the lines of '192.168.1.whatever'.

Brand new you   have a value well over $400, however some of it is not in prime condition but I believe you can still get a great value. Subtract half the value the open games/accessories and take $100 off the game console for being open and you should have a pretty good idea of the value. If you don't know the value of your games, accessories or game console you can use this website as a reference guide www.wiisteals.info

You might need a wireless adapter like this  http://www.amazon.co.uk/Xbox-360-Wireles...  This is an acerage price for them as they are not cheap.  Or if you have ethernet ports at the back of your Modem/Router you can have a ethernet going straight from your Xbox to Modem.  This is the cheaper option as an ethernet cable costs around 5.  Hope this helps|`|N37Udp4Iaa	Plug your xbox into your modem first, Go to the dashboard and there's an option to join xbox live. You will need a credit card to do it.

It is completely safe and virus free. Best of all is that compared to many suggestions of peer-2-peer software that aren't legal and can pass viruses, this is Completely LEGAL and FREE! <br>  <br>  Here it is for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.spiralfrog.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.spiralfrog.com</a><br>  <br>  To start off, there are 2 different answers:<br>  1) Free downloads that are legal<br>  2) Free Illegal downloads (limewire,kaza, frostwire, torrents, imesh, etc)<br>  <br>  I'll deal with #1.<br>  Since the whole issue about downloading music, the music companies and Artists themselves need to earn "income" from their music work. To be fair, they ARE entitled to it. Nobody wants to work for free.<br>  <br>  This is why the (new) Napster, Rhapsody, Walmart, Itunes, emusic, Amazon, etc exist and charge for their music. Bottom line...If you want legal downloads, you have to "pay" for it.<br>  <br>  HOWEVER, there is another option. "Pay" doesn't have to be money. Spiralfrog.com deals with the whole "Pay" idea as being "Banner Ad" income. The more ads you see the more money they make, and they DO pass the income to the artists/music companies.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, seeing the ads once don't provide a recurring source of income to the company, so they require you to come back to their website to 'renew' your licenses every 30-60 days by taking their 5 question survey again. Not a real problem since I check them out several times a week.<br>  <br>  Their selection of NEW music is mixed. SOME new albums are released through them at the same time as other sites. MANY may not make it until some time has passed, and others never show up. You have to look around and see if their selection is good for you.<br>  <br>  Oh, 2 things to take note of:<br>  1) You need to have a player that supports .wma files with DRM (Digital Rights Management).

iYprPfH5aa	AT&T is crap.  Go to the Apple Store near you.  AT&T stores are the worst when it comes to buying the iPhone.    Technically you have to be "approved" to buy the iPhone at the "full price" which apparently, if you look closely isn't the full price.... which makes me wonder...|`|lU8e0VQFaa	Sounds like the AT&T people are just trying to get more money out of you.

After it has the light blue line, highlighting it, press AppleCommant and the letter "i". (You could also "ctrl" + click the movie or, after it is highlighted, go to "FILE > GET INFO"    When the information screen pops up, go to the "Options" tab.    In the "Options" Tab, locate the scroll-down menu labeled "Media Kind"    Then, select from "Movie", "TV Show" or "Music Video".    When you click "OK", the video will go to it's rightful place :-)    Hope I helped!

j5Apt8hWaa	In general, buying a P&S camera with a better optical zoom is the way to go, since you cannot change or add lenses until you either buy a new camera or upgrade to a DSLR<br>  <br>  Both cameras have excellent lenses and have been making cameras for many years.<br>  <br>  What you can do is take a SD memory card with you into a store that sells both and just shoot a test.  Shots at both ends of the zoom range, at the two extremes of the ISO range and a few test shots at the closest focus point.  Then take the card home and look at the results on you nice large computer monitor ... then YOU will know which is the best for your style of shooting.<br>  <br>  RAW is when the camera can record all the information that is collected on the sensor which increases the amount of data stored on the image file ... that means the potential of a higher quality image and larger enlargements.  Cameras that only capture the images in JPEG remove over 75% of the data actually "seen" by the sensor when the image is processed.<br>  <br>  Did you know you can compare the two cameras side by side on <a href="http://www.dpreview.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.dpreview.com</a> ?

AA12380716	The 17-85 is a smaller lens, and lighter weight if you are going to be out carrying it around.  The 18-200 has more focal range, and will be more versatile... I'd probably go for the 18-200, considering the way I shoot... You need to think about what you like to shoot, and how you'll be using the lens. and go for whichever you think you'll get the most use from.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	The question is, do you need the coverage the 18-200 mm ($700) lens gives you over your excellent 17-85 mm ($500) lens?  Since both are EF-S lenses if you ever do go full frame (DSLR or 35 mm) you will not be able to use either lens.  For me if it was an EF lens, it would worth it as a lens for shooting editorial when using a flash is not always advisable.  Since I shoot with both full frame and APS-C sensored cameras I need lenses I can interchange.<br>  <br>  Most of the Canon shooters I know, only buy EF lenses because the know they will eventually be buying a 5D, 1D or whatever Canon releases in the next few years and don't want to be stuck with lenses that they cannot use.<br>  <br>  You may want to look at the fine Canon EF 70-200mm f/2.8L ($1700) or f/4 ($1100) and extend your coverage and start building your EF lens system.<br>  <br>  NOTE:  If you own Canon or Nikon lenses, don't sell them ... they are excellent lenses ... just buy additional lenses that will enhance your camera system|`|gcDY8iqnaa	a super zoom generally is not as good as two separate lens and it is rare that you need the range and could not have anticipated the necessity to change the lens. I would spend the money on a 70-200 f4, 70-200 f2.8 with or without IS or 70-300 if you need that range.|`|hXO7xKkVaa	its not easy to carry mutliple lenses all the time..as 18-200 is great lense as it offer nearly 12x xoom with same wide ange of 17-85mm<br>  <br>  and if u r not planning to go for expensive 70-200mm /2.8 IS lenses purchase 18-200mm ryt now

TbTO5SXlaa	No. <br>  <br>  However, its a perfect fit on any of the Sony DSLR cameras plus, since Sony has their version of image stabilization in the camera body, the lens will have that benefit.|`|hXO7xKkVaa	actually both the mounts are different so cant use for ur canon camera..any way this lense is nice one but not compatible with any of canon cameras|`|lXZRuVSOaa	No it will not! you need to have a len's that has a canon mount on it! if not a lot of the functionss will not work!<br>  <br>  Thank You,<br>  <br>  Bob
