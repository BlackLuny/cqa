I am sure none of you believe that this person standing before you today, was a timid fragile thing once upon a time.      A lot of you do not know this, but I come from a science background; so for me this Commerce journey has been unbelievably astounding.

Those who are changed have stolen the show. The wineglasses are glimmered better than the chandeliers on the ceiling. Hundreds of alumni were there to reunite with friends, while others came to make their enemies jealous. There is a story behind every person who graduated from that batch. Typical highschool stories about different social cliques brought back some bittersweet memories.  The majority has evolved.  The campus chick that once has the guys drooling had turned into a voluptuous and unattractive house wife. The Jock who was the king of the varsity is now a nerdy rocket scientist. The campus hunk who had the girls screaming is now screaming louder than the girls, after his operation.
