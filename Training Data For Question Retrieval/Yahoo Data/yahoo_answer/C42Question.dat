Se repiten las misma palabras: "Argentina", "argentinos" y "todos" y, el pronombre de la 1ra persona del singular: “YO” , son las que más pronuncia.   El discurso de ayer en Parque Norte es una muestra más de lo dicho.   Como "Presidenta" se mencionó 18 veces, y el pronombre "Yo" lo usó en 21 oportunidades.

20090204043727AA6nEF8	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Why is Obama showing favoritism to his illegal alien aunt?	Zeituni Onyango is Obama's 56-year-old Kenyan aunt, the half-sister of his father. She had been living illegally in a South Boston slum, in defiance of a 2004 court order that she be deported.      Ms. Onyango is a fugitive from justice, presently hiding somewhere in the dark side of Cleveland, Ohio, while her lawyer tries to stall her deportation in Boston. She probably believes that she does not have to obey the law, now that her nephew has been installed as president. Her deportation case was reopened shortly after Obama won the popular election.      The deportation order was stayed on 17 Dec 2008 -- why?      It would appear that Obama, who probably is an illegal alien himself, is inclined to corruptly shield his aunt from deportation, despite sanctimonious words to the contrary. Obama used process flaws, by which he was not required to prove his own citizenship, in order to become the US head of state. Now that he's done that, he's mastered the trick, and seems to be about to extend his expertise on his illegal aunt's behalf, by saying all the right things, but failing to follow through with the right deeds.      Obama said of his aunt last November: "If she is violating laws those laws have to be obeyed. We're a nation of laws. Obviously that doesn't lessen my concern for her, I haven't been able to be in touch with her. But I'm a strong believer you have to obey the law."      The aunt is still in the United States.      On Jan. 21, 2009, Obama said, "Let me say this as simply as I can. Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency."      The aunt is still in the United States.      Fine words. No follow-through. That's the hallmark of a hypocrite or a trickster.

If you are sitting at your computer still munching on 'sour grapes' over Obama's election, please skip this question.       http://www.politico.com/news/stories/010...    Congressional Democrats are firing a surprising number of unexpectedly sharp brush-back pitches at President-elect Obama and his staff over policy plans and personnel picks, making him look embattled during what was to be a triumphant debut week in Washington.      The honeymoon isn’t over – the president-elect remains widely popular, even among some Republicans – and his inauguration on Jan. 20 will be a signature event in the lifetime of most Americans, giving his opening days a greater lift and pop than any president since at least Ronald Reagan.      But as Obama buckled down his week as a shadow government across Lafayette Park from the waning one in the White House, Democrats hit him with daily fast balls reflecting two realities: His team is smart but not perfect, and Democrats are supportive but not supine.      The days of automatic 'rubber-stamping' are over?   Opinions?

Marx a suo tempo suddivise la categoria dei socialisti in tre classi: conservatori, borghesi, democratici (chi voglia conoscere tale suddivisione consulti il manifesto).   premesso che considero Marx una mente geniale e quindi la mia domanda una sorta di "imprecazione" alla sua scienza, trovo tale suddivisione in parte giusta, ma dall'altra unicamente soggettiva e adatta a tempi remoti. Vi chiedo, sareste capaci, prendendo in considerazione l'arco dei tempi passati, dalla stesura del manifesto, fino ai giorni nostri, quali categorie di comunisti individuereste, come li classificate. volendo possiamo usare gli stessi termini, conservatori - fedeli ai dogmi marxisti, minoranza intellettuale, borghesi - amanti del lusso e della politica burocratica di partito, democratici - sguardo verso il proletario con ammiccata al piccolo borghese, plasmati dai tempi che cambiano.   in fondo anche i cosiddetti "comunisti" subiscono alterazioni nel tempo, e non sono immuni a nulla.

20090205143500AAhbXID	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are the Senate Republicans ignoring a simple political reality?	Obama was elected by a majority of Americans because they wanted him to change the way politicians run our government.      For the last 5-6 years, we have allowed the so-called Bush Tax Cuts to stay in place.      Now we have a major stimulus package being offered that is trying to change the way our government runs---      Old way--Bush's Tax Cuts, giving money to tax payers to do what they want with the money, even if they just hoarded the money and failed to create jobs (which for all intents and purposes did not work)      New way--Remove the tax cuts, and have the Government structured spending to bring more money back into the economy by creating more jobs      So the Senate Republicans are ignoring the wishes of the majority of Americans who want Obama to run things differently....no matter who receives a continuing harm from their efforts.      Do they think that the American People are going to let them (the Senate and Congressional Republicans) keep their jobs, if by failing to cooperate with the Democratic Plan, they stall the common man's recovery from the failures of the Bush Tax Cuts, by insisting on yet more tax cuts?      Isn't this just more of the same partisan bickering that ended the Republican dominance in the government in the first place?

Three days after receiving $25 billion in federal bailout funds, Bank of America Corp. hosted a conference call with conservative activists and business officials to organize opposition to the U.S. labor community's top legislative priority.      Participants on the October 17 call -- including at least one representative from another bailout recipient, AIG -- were urged to persuade their clients to send "large contributions" to groups working against the Employee Free Choice Act (EFCA), as well as to vulnerable Senate Republicans, who could help block passage of the bill.      Bernie Marcus, the charismatic co-founder of Home Depot, led the call along with Rick Berman, an aggressive EFCA opponent and founder of the Center for Union Facts. Over the course of an hour, the two framed the legislation as an existential threat to American capitalism, or worse.      "This is the demise of a civilization," said Marcus. "This is how a civilization disappears.         OK, your On.. defend this.. It's bad enough we were forced to Give them The Bailout..YES FORCED! we all sat glued to our Media Machines waiting to see if the sky would fall (as promised) if that money was not given to these Criminals, they then turn around almost immediately..within days, and begin Use it against US (as in U.S.)   ??????

The timetable doesn't force the millitary to do anything, its just a set of accomplshments the American people want to see get taken care of so we can withdraw from Iraq eventually; the vast majority of the American people (70%) want the U.S. out of there within two years, certainly 70% of American's do not think a withdraw is a surrender, why does Bush and his crony's believe this?        The violence in Iraq is between two groups, Sunni and Shite, and will continue regardless of if we are there or not. Iraq needs to take its destiny into its own hands.

Do you regret getting into either one? 1 last question, because of my religion, and heritageI'm half asian and black, I cannot cut my hair, I am able to have it braided as in corn rolls, nice and neat even though I'm not "permitted" to, will that be a problem. Please only police officers or state troopers answer. Thanks.

So I was looking for a toll free phone number which I can use to activate my debit card, well I found one, and I called it. An automated system, asked me for my card number which I did not give. I just simply pressed 0. Then it went to a dile tone, after a few tones, a guy picked up did not state his name, but just stated that he was with my bank and asked for my card number, then I just asked him, which number is the card activation number, then he asked for my card number again, I told him I wasn't going to give out  my number over the phone when I don't even know who I' am speaking with. I asked him if he would state his name, he simply just said Elen, Then I asked him which branch and who is he representing, he said something about loans, I then asked him why he needed my card number. Then he just suddenly asked if I wanted the toll free number for the activation, I said sure that's why I called. He then takes a few minutes, sounded like he was on the internet, and gave me the exact same number that I used and got him. So it all just sounds fishy to me. Just suspicious, what should I do?

Basically says McCains support is falling...      Here's the actual poll data, check page 6, note the details on page 1 top right...       http://surveys.ap.org/data/KnowledgeNetw...       Now I'll go point by point not to lose you who might be lacking in the ability to follow simple things.      This poll is of 873 democrat vs 650 republican voters. 25% more democrat voters.      The margin of error is 3.8%      The largest margin is 4 points, Obama leads in each wave.      This is within the margin of error.      This is closer than the previous poll.      The Obama advantage is only 4% max.      That 4% max is significantly less than the difference between democrats and republicans.      ??      LMAO      For the record, I think polls are stupid and useless, and are only good for telling trends, if that.      However my point here is the AP is simply making up a story intended to paint McCain as losing more ground when he is actually gaining on Obama, and HAS to be getting democrat support as there were 25% more democrats polled, yet he is only behind by 4% max.      HILARIOUS      So, do you still think we are nuts when we say they are biased?

20090223004644AA3k8Mo	Politics & Government;Elections	Is racism growing under the radar where you are in america?	i live near my hometown and go there for groceries and such. the town was predominately white years ago and then they began building section eight housing and there was a sudden influx of afro-americans from the southside of the near large city who have begun to "take over" at the schools. when you would arrive to drop off your kid they would be assembled in mass at the entrance of the schools laughing at the white kids and generally being disruptive.   the other day i went to the grocery store there, which now the  afro-american clerks outnumber the white ones by 3 to 1. i tried to use an att visa rebate card and the afro-american clerk said it wouldn't work and just stood there smiling in my face. the card worked everywhere else i took it but she wouldn't even attempt to make it transact. i'm getting used to this type of treatment in the town. i'm not racist myself but don't like people assuming that me and my kid are and giving us crap about it.
20090223012856AA9Qz0h	Politics & Government;Elections	Republicans AND Democrats: How would you respond to this?	THIS ARE NOT MY WORDS!  I JUST CAME ACROSS IT ONLINE AND WONDERED WHAT YOUR RESPONSE WOULD BE.  THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO A PERSON WHO SAID THAT THEIR HUSBAND LEFT THEM WITH 2 KIDS AND THEY DREW WELFARE FOR A FEW MONTHS UNTIL THEY COULD GET BACK ON THEIR FEET:      If you support Obama and his socialist ilk in Congress, that can only mean you're either looking for a handout for yourself, or for a "loved" one so the government can support them instead of you having to.   That's a crude way of putting it, I know, but it is the truth. You'll never catch me in a government office with my hand out. I would starve to death first, or blow my own brains out before I become a burden on my fellow taxpaying citizens. I have pride, and I literally stake my life on that pride.      Don't even bring needing any amount of help for your kids into this. If you are unable to support a family on your own, then keep your legs closed and your prick in your pants. Don't ask me to pay for your careless breeding.      I tell it true: people are getting fed up, and the ones getting fed up are the producers in this country. You best be waking up to reality, you shameless leeches.
20090222191229AA6jAvY	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Please Help Me, This is Due Tomorrow.. I need help?	This is my opening statement:   A man who seeks to avenge his father's murder, this is Hamlet. In this quest, Hamlet appears to others as a madman, acting insanely and speaking bafflingly. Before he finishes, six people whose paths he's crossed will also lose their lives. These include Claudius, the man Hamlet believes to have murdered his father; and Polonius, the King’s advisor and the father of Ophelia, Hamlet’s love interest. The list also includes Laetres, Ophelia’s brother; and Rosencrantz and Guildenstern, spies for Claudius. All of these victims deserve to be justified for their murders and their avengement lays within this prosecution and conviction. (if you have an revisions, they're welcome as well!)

Now my US Citizen Mexican born friend is facing IRS Charges become someone else  chose to use the same nubmers.

The news is there. The stats are there. They hit you every day like a Katyusha in your face.      So far the US hasn't seen much, but will liberals really continue to answer every post like this by reciting their mantra that Americans must always accept ALL immigrants regardless of race, religion, color, or national origin, and ignore the facts of what's been shown to happen whenever you have a significant Muslim minority?      Let's put it this way--I'm an ex-Muslim. A Muslim apostate. In Islamic tradition the penalty for leaving Islam is death. We don't have strict Islamic law here, but religious Muslims the world over share this belief. I used to want to live in Europe--now I'm not going there because it would be too dangerous to express myself. There was an organization in the Netherlands for people like me and it had to close because of death threats and a knife assault on the founder right in the middle of the street.      Let's hope America won't be the same. Instead of admitting Muslim fundamentalists from Egypt or Pakistan or Bangladesh or Somalia, why not open your doors to Muslim apostates, or women escaping arranged marriages, or the thousands of persecuted Christians in the Middle East?

20090223004403AATbMaB	Politics & Government;Law & Ethics	Can my mom do this according to the law?	I'm 18 and I live in the dorms at my college. My family (we live in Maryland and I go to school in Maryland by the way) has one car and it's in my mother's name even though she doesn't even have a driver's license. I'm the only licensed driver in my family besides my stepfather, but he lives in Texas and he's not on our policy or anything.       My mom overreacts over EVERYTHING no matter how small. One time I dropped a can of soda by accident on the kitchen floor tiles and she kicked me out of the house for that. And she talks to herself in whispers when she thinks she's alone. And not small talk, I mean conversations. I know and she knows that she has some psychological problem but she refuses to address it and she gets EXTREMELY hostile if I ask her about it.      But anyway, so I was at college and I made a mistake. I bought the wrong book for one class and she freaked. I returned the book, got back all of the money, and bought the right book, which actually cost less. She freaked anyway. The car is 150 miles away from home with me at college. She said she was going to lie to the Maryland state police and say that I stole the car so that they can arrest me.      I did NOT steal the car. She LENT me the car so that I could go back and forth between school and home on weekends. But she said she's going to report it as stolen just to "teach me a lesson in life".       The ***** is crazy I know. But in this case, can the police really arrest me? What can I do? I don't want to get arrested obviously.       My mom said in her own words: "the police will never believe a bratty teenager like you". I really don't know what to do here.
20090223004531AAvgSOq	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	Racism is Over glorified?	Why does modern American culture overlook the fact that slavery has been happening in Africa for thousands of years way before Europeans ever came over. And the fact over 95% of the slaves that were sold to America where Africans who sold their fellow Africans as slaves captured in tribal battles. I mean slavery in America was wrong all 200 years of it but slavery still happens to this day in many parts of Africa. This whole white guilt thing is absolutely absurd. I don't owe anything to anybody in fact the conditions for slaves caught from tribal warfare in Africa was actually as bad if not worse than in America not justifying anything. But they often starved, couldn't build there own mud huts, had to sleep in the outside couldn't grow and keep their own crops had to give all of it to the ruling tribe as well as their women. I don't owe a damn thing to any one and I'm not paying my taxes for a culture that's been *** backwards from the start and does  deserve rights and freedom but not compensation.

20090223010250AAtg3WI	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	Can i get out of this speeding ticket i recieved in my cousins neighbourhood.?	Ok, so i was picking up my cousin from his neighbourhood and then i saw the cop making a turn into the neighbourhood. I had 7 to 8 seconds to slow my speed and i believe i did. I ended up waving to the officer as we went past each other continued on my way. After a while i see him closing in on me real fast. I pulled over and he wrote me a ticket for 216 something dollars. He had clocked me doing 37 in 25 neighbourhood. I told the officer i was not going that fast.. Even my cousin can attest to that fact. Why would i not slow down , even though i had around 8 seconds to slow down and then wave to him if i was speeding. I heard moving radar is full of errors and he was accelerating after he came around in the corner and clocked me at 37, he drives a dodge charger btw , so this car can accelerate pretty fast. Also the angle between us was less around 20 to 30 percent, so i believe cosine error is what happened to me.. Can i fight this in court? I mean, how can my neighbour do this to me!  I was not speeding! i might have been going 5 miles over the limit tops! I had So much time to slow down and i did!  Either he got ticked off that i was waving at him or there was a mistake in the radar gun!

I was going about 80... he pulls me over, claims that by the time he got to me he clocked me at 89 approaching 91..... he gave me a ticket for 170$. On the ticket he says i was going 80.5. I have a state of the art radar detector in my car and yet on the ticket it says that he "clocked" me... what does that even mean??      He literally threw my liscense and insurance stuff at me... started to walk away, i said "sir" cuz I wanted to ask him these questions and he didnt respond, jumped in his car and sped off... Any chance of fighting this? like shouldnt he have to stay and answer my questions? he didnt even tell me how much the citation was for or n e thing, just said respond to the citation or you will go to jail...       He did not use radar... there a list of things he can check off: radar, ESP, clocked, vascar, a.o.v, other. He checked off clocked.         I had gotten two tickets previously... both were for going 15 miles over the speed limit althought both officers didnt say there was going to be any points against me. I hadn't gotten a ticket in over a year. This time i was going 25.5 over the speed limit and the officer didnt tell me anything about whether I would be assesed any points against my license. I did alot of reading and apparently insurance companies will jack up your rates if you plea guilty. The officer wasn't a state trooper... should I just pay the fine or should I try to fight it and avoid the potential points against my license and possible increases in insurance rates? ANSWERS ARE MUCH APPRECIATED, THANK YOU!

20090223021435AAYWPoV	Politics & Government;Civic Participation	Can these "reformed" terrorists explain why it takes staffs of 200+ each for personal security?	I guess that must mean you are really insecure of the people in "your" areas. Karuna, your statement crediting yourself with the 250  former LTTE cadres that have surrendered to military is false. Can you please explain why it takes a staff off 200+  security personnel  to ensure your personal safety? I understand that this is the same for Pilliyain. My question is such-when LTTE forces have to go through Batticaloa and Trincomalee to reach Ampara from LTTE controlled areas and you have “2000 party member” + 400 security – why are those LTTE terrorists that machete people not identified by your people? I further understand that on last Friday night, the same as the terror attack on Colombo that a TMVP party member had been killed there in your area. It is quite interesting that though you and Pilliyain have apparently given up your terrorist ways that you continue to have such lack of regard for the lives of Tamils, Muslims, Burghers and Singhalese. Apparently you have a very high regard for your own life and safety, booking entire hotels (at government’s expense) for your avoidance of danger in the areas you want to represent and boasting of such huge security details for your individual safety. Pilliyain and Karuna, the people in your areas are complaining that they still do not feel safe-mostly because of the two of you and security details You apparently don’t feel safe from your own people. Why would leadership such as this ever be considered valid or effective? You are still holding at least a few child soldiers, you have not effectively contributed to the security of the nation by utilizing your current/former sources and you both seem to have very little care for the average constituent you claim to represent. These people are saying that you both are inadequate in representing an interest other than those of your own clique. I am certain that there are many members of the TMVP that know that they of their own volition can join SLFP and learn effective leadership skills for they certainly are not learning those by Karuna or Pilliyain. The rest of you guys that were at 8/27, if you would like to see to the needs of your people and not worry about getting buckshot courtesy of the Nadesans, Pabraharakans, Pilliyains and Karunas of the world - go talk to the SLFP. Apparently, those guys(Nadesans, Pabraharakans, Pilliyains and Karunas) believe that their lives are much more meaningful and valuable than yours. The story seems to go that for any right that you all do(such as former cadres turning themselves in) they get the credit and for any wrong that they (like not assisting with investigations to the death of their own party members and civilians at large)  you get the blame. Sounds like a RAW deal to me.  http://www.dailymirror.lk/DM_BLOG/Sectio...     Your families suffer under this mentality and their families live abroad.    http://in.news.yahoo.com/43/20090222/876...    If I remember correctly, when Pilliyain and Karuna have their turf battles it is you guys that end up as Raghu. It is better to be a tall Chooty than a spoon fed Pilliyain. I severely doubt that you will be having tourists in your areas as long as there are buried weapons caches, machete weilding mobs and people that are afraid to come out of their houses after dark. Change is not superficial, this is not a bollywood film. It is your real lives.   Why would Karuna be so interested in keeping with pre-1983 ethnic ratios if it was not on the belief that he would keep rule over all of you and play the turf wars as needed with your lives? Join a blue-ribbon panel with Karuna and Pilliyains boss, that way more of your needs will be met.  http://www.peaceinsrilanka.org/peace2005...    Take some IT and English courses    http://www.asiantribune.com/?q=node/1571...    If you have friends that are still with the LTTE encourage them to put down their arms and come and join you.

In term of gaining the confident of the neutral citizens (the silent voters), doesn't it seems that the following acts will back fire and Pakatan Rakyat may lose support from the neutral citizens:      1. The reluctant of Dato' Seri Hj Mohd Nizar to relinquish his post even though the Sultan of Perak (who is a former Judge and Lord President) has decided not to dissolve the state assembly but instead choose to appoint a new Menteri Besar;      2. Taking legal action to determine the status of Menteri Besar which certain group can manipulate it to show Pakatan Rakyat does not respect the Rulers of Malaysia, in general.      3. The speaker suspended the new Menteri Besar and his excos may be seen by majority as an act of "derhaka" to the Sultan of Perak or to the Malay Rulers in general.      Pakatan Rakyat have gain the confident and votes of the neutral citizens. Doesn't the above acts will cause the neutral citizens to go back and support Barisan Nasional.       The hardcore supporters of Barisan Nasional will surely support and vote for BN. The hardcore supporters of Pakatan Rakyat will surely support and vote for Pakatan Rakyat. But it is the support of the majority of the neutral citizens that the political parties need to gain.      Do you agree? why?
