Get a full blood panel done so you can see your Cholesterol levels and even if you are low on any vital minerals or vitamins.<br>  <br>  Personally if I had a choice I would do that or go to the vitamin store and purchase a few things like<br>  <br>  Colloidal Silver which is a natural antibiotic that is good for almost any infection and it is safe. <br>  <br>  I would get some good absorable multi vitamins in case you are out of work and cannot eat properly or under a lot of stress these help.<br>  <br>  Maybe even something that helps with stress. <br>  <br>  Extra Vitamin C and Echinacea when those colds and flu hits.<br>  <br>  Anything else thatis handy to have in the cupboard that is over the counter to help in case you were to get sick they could get you thru. <br>  <br>  Now mind you if it is a major emergency you can go to the Er, but might as well use up that last bit of money like you aid and not waste it. <br>  <br>  This is what I would do. <br>  <br>  By the way I am close to 40 and have experienced being out of health insurance and these things I mentioned were lifesavers.

Just stay away from them!  :)|`|cp7fjeJhaa	they do the exact same thing to me.  many people have allergies to onions, you are allergic to a substance in it, you may be allergic to garlic too, so be careful.  i take digestive enzymes they are suppose to help somewhat with food allergies, so im gonna see if it works.......just avoid onions the best you can.  google onion allergy you will be surprised how many people have it.|`|e0jXTXTxaa	you may be alergic to onions|`|sPT8ikgXaa	you may be allergic to them
yOwRD4ZEaa	Ativan and valium are both benzodiazapines. They're used to treat anxiety mostly. Valium has muscle relaxing properties but ativan really doesn't. Definitely take the valium instead of the ativan. <br>  <br>  Percocet and vicodin are both narcotic pain relievers. Both contain tylenol and shouldn't really be taken together. Feel free to alternate between them if you want. (ie take 1 vicodin and then 1 percocet 4-6 hours later). <br>  <br>  You can take 1 pain reliever and 1 benzo together. It doesn't really matter which combination you use. Just don't take the valium and ativan together or the vicodin and percocet together. Like I said before, the ativan is basically worthless unless you need to sleep.|`|wRow3wC1aa	okay  ativan is a benzo  like xanax, valium.<br>  <br>  if i were u i would take vicoden and ativan
ParFJxnSaa	For most people, it's around 30 mns. View the techniques for control of anxiety/panic attacks, in section 8, at ezy build, below. Begin, on this first occasion, only, by holding your breath for 5, or 10 seconds: this will give you the confidence to realise that YOU CAN CONTROL YOUR BREATHING, but not pass out, or die (your autonomic nervous system resumes breathing, if you become unconscious). Advice from a published psychiatrist on controlled breathing: (1.) Get a clock, or watch with a second timer. (2.) Practise for 5 minutes, 4 times daily, until proficient. (3.) Take a small breath in, and hold it, for 6 seconds. (4.) Think to yourself: "RELAX", just before breathing out. (5.) Try to feel a sense of releasing tension, as you breathe out. (6.) Breathe in for 3 seconds, then out, for 3 seconds. Try to make your breathing very smooth, and light, as you breathe in through your nose, and out through your mouth, or nose. (7.) For the next minute, continue to breathe in, and out, every 3 seconds. (8.) Go back to step 3, at the end of the minute, and proceed through to step 7, doing this for 5 minutes. Use this at the very first sign of a panic attack starting, or any time you feel anxious, or tense. Similar, but simpler advice, from a clinical psychologist is to breathe in to the count of 3: (one thousand one; one thousand two; one thousand three) each takes around a second to say to yourself, in your mind. Then breathe out to the count of 3. Repeat, until it begins to take effect. Understand panic attacks, and what triggers them, in your life (if it is unresolved anxiety, or stress, see sections 6, [page N first] or 42, [page i first] respectively). <br>  <br>  The paper bag method also works for most people, but is not suited to all circumstances, such as driving, or playing sport. Another alternative is psychotherapy, to address its fundamental cause, which is usually anxiety; read section 1, and examine the <a href="http://1-800-therapist.com/" rel="nofollow">http://1-800-therapist.com/</a> & <a href="http://www.metanoia.org/choose/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metanoia.org/choose/</a> websites, and use the locators to find a therapist, (and phone book, but only if necessary). I used to suffer from panic attacks, until I questioned what had changed in my life, at, or just before that time, to trigger them, which is enough for some people. Visualise as vividly as possible, a large, red, flashing, "STOP!" sign, and/or possibly a stern faced person wagging an index finger at you in a negative manner, then say to yourself as forcefully as you can, even aloud in a big voice, if alone: "I know this tactic: GO AWAY FOR A WHILE !!!" You may want to us either: "ruse", "ploy", "game", or "trick", instead of "tactic". It usually takes 30 - 40 repetitions, for most people, to establish a new habit. I also suggest that you learn, then practise the controlled breathing technique, until competent, then employ it, at the very first sign of a panic attack.<br>  <br>  Practice one of the relaxation methods in sections 11, 2, 2c, or 2i, daily, and when needed. Also, give the EFT a good tryout, to see if it helps you. There is also a version for use in public places, (if you like, you can claim to have a headache, as you massage/lightly tap your temples, but you would then be restricted to subvocalising - saying it to yourself in your mind). Sections 53, and 2, 2.q and 2.o at <a href="http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris" rel="nofollow">http://www.ezy-build.net.nz/~shaneris</a> also refer: "Even though I sometimes suffer from panic attacks, I deeply and completely accept myself." Note: the controlled breathing only helps with the symptoms (as do medications/herbal remedies): you need to address the underlying cause, which requires some form of therapy, and Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy has been shown to be effective. Imagine that the cause of your panic; your anxieties, fears, your self doubts, self recriminations, all the agonizing "I'm-so-Stupids"; every painful "I-can't-do-it" are huge raging, hurtful bulls snorting and charging at you. You see them coming at you and you hold out your red matador's cape at arms length and simply let them charge right by.|`|cPgOxcS7aa	It all depends.  Like a month ago I woke up out of a dead sleep with one and it lasted almost an hour.  Most of the time when I do have them they last anywhere from 5-15 minutes.  The faster you get yourself calmed down the faster it goes away.  Also I heard try breathing into a bag because it helps you somehow.|`|38KXhJPiaa	Depends....Some last 10 minutes, others last a lot longer. <br>  <br>  I hate those damn things. I get them quit often (mainly because I am a worry-freak...I worry about everything....I won't lie).<br>  <br>  Just calm yourself down when your having one. If you feel one coming on, sit or lay down and try to think about good things or talk to people. That always helps me!|`|DIuE4vshaa	Mine may last as long as 4 hours.

My summer vacation, for example? A chain of anxiety attacks from the minute we left to the minute we got home.|`|MmRDzhaHaa	They can last for different times every time it happens! if it happens again, try putting a paper bag over your nose and mouth and breath in and out slowly and calmly, this will make the heart rate slow down to a normal pace making the attack stop sooner.|`|R3ow0BLzaa	It depends.. sometimes there really bad and can last around an hour and then other times they go away within a few min. Just remember that you are not going crazy.. it is your body responding to stress and try to talk yourself down from it. When I get panic attacks I kind of embrace them and say im not scared of this happening because it will be gone soon and it won't hurt me. If that doesn't work a nice shower usually helps! Hope your feeling better|`|AA12012931	I would say two days. Usually they last about two hours at most.

kOKqk0PIaa	Well to answer this question, I need to know how tall you are and how much you weigh. It also depends if your metabolism is fast or slow but a rough estimate can be given by knowing your height,weight, and level of excercise (sedentary,lightly active, very active, etc.)<br>  An easy formula to calculate how much you need multiply <br>  weight(kgs) x 15 if sedentary<br>  Or weight (kgs) x 17 if active<br>  <br>  If you are a teen eat approx. 2200 calories! Your body is still growing and needs the proper intake to develop and grow!|`|3p3otDlXaa	1850 eat and burn about 180.|`|RZQOdbrbaa	go to www.mypyramid.com and put ur info in and it will calculate it for u.|`|AA11485682	The exact number depends on how tall you are, and what your metabolism is. Basically, if you're trying to lose weight, try drinking water instead of anything else, and exercise. Slow and steady weight loss is better than crash diets, as those tend to make you regain the weight later.
AG9msdUDaa	Absolutely! For mood and energy take vitamin B complex, magnesium, vitamin D, omega 3 and probiotics. Read the article below for a scientific explanation as to why these help.<br>  <br>  You may also want to get a nutritional assessment from your doctor to see if you are low on anything that may be causing the bulk of your issues, such as iron.

Blackmores do a good one....  the B complex will help bolster your system against the stress we're all exposed to at some level or another on a daily basis and help with your iron absorption levels and also bolster healthy immune, digestive and neural functioning ........ particularly if you are vegetarian or lactose intolerant.<br>  <br>  Eat more fresh fruits and leafy and green vegies and their juices too ..... a quick energy boost is to have a couple of pieces of fruit or a nice crisp green leafy salad or bowl of vegies........... try it mate, it works.<br>  <br>  Drink more fresh filtered water too .... you need water to think clearly, digest your food, transport your nutrients, lubricate your joints, to do anything at all really ........ you'd be amazed at how being just a little dehydrated can affect your mood and energy levels and even any attempts to lose weight ........ drink up mate, at least 8 glasses daily.<br>  <br>  Ditch the processed sugar too as it has been chemically processed, highly refined and is nutritionally void and will leach you of precious vitamins and minerals you already have........ that includes sodas, pop, soft drinks (which will also dehydrate you and leach the calcium straight from your bones), candies, lollies, chocolate, ice cream etc... or at the very least cut right back on them.<br>  <br>  take care of you<br>  <br>  peace baby<br>  ?|`|xL7QbJomaa	I'm going to sound like some sort of hippy, but..who cares here I go:<br>  Yes the b vitamins will up your energy level (temporarily)<br>  <br>    Now, from a physiological point of view- when you start adding isolated vitamin, minerals, etc, etc to your diet your bolus that specific level in your body, BUT the body will always self regulate. SO, it will have to reduce the newly added component or reduce another vitamin/mineral already in your system. <br>  Therefore, I urge you to create some sort of balance by eating nutritiously on a consistent bases. This will give you the mental & physical energy you need to be the most productive you can be. <br>  A good way to begin is to limit caffeine, excessively sugary products, nicotine, and soda altogether.<br>  Wish you all the best<br>  Rory|`|NqOLTHaLaa	vitamins<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>    (Redirected from Vitamin b)<br>  Jump to: navigation, search<br>   <br>  B vitamin supplement tabletsThe B vitamins are eight water-soluble vitamins that play important roles in cell metabolism. Historically, the B vitamins were once thought to be a single vitamin, referred to as vitamin B (much like how people refer to vitamin C or vitamin D). Later research showed that they are chemically distinct vitamins that often coexist in the same foods. Supplements containing all eight are generally referred to as a vitamin B complex. Individual B vitamin supplements are referred to by the specific name of each vitamin (e.g. B1, B2, B3 etc ).<br>  <br>  Contents [hide]<br>  1 List of B vitamins <br>  1.1 Former or unclassified vitamins <br>  2 B vitamin deficiency <br>  3 Related nutrients <br>  4 Health benefits <br>  5 Vitamin B sources <br>  6 Mnemonic <br>  7 See also <br>  8 References <br>  9 External links <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] List of B vitamins<br>  Vitamin B1 (thiamine) <br>  Vitamin B2 (riboflavin) <br>  Vitamin B3 (niacin, includes nicotinic acid and nicotinamide) <br>  Vitamin B5 (pantothenic acid) <br>  Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine) <br>  Vitamin B7 (biotin), also known as vitamin H <br>  Vitamin B9 (folic acid), also, vitamin M <br>  Vitamin B12 (various cobalamins; commonly cyanocobalamin in vitamin supplements) <br>  <br>  [edit] Former or unclassified vitamins<br>  Vitamin B4 (adenine, DNA metabolite) is no longer classified as a vitamin because it is synthesized by the human body[citation needed] <br>  Vitamin B8 (myo-inositol, adenylic acid, DNA metabolite) is no longer classified as a vitamin because it is synthesized by the human body[citation needed] <br>  <br>  [edit] B vitamin deficiency<br>  Several named vitamin deficiency diseases may result from the lack of sufficient B-vitamins. Deficiencies of other B vitamins result in symptoms that are not part of a named deficiency disease.<br>  <br>  Vitamin Name Deficiency effects <br>  Vitamin B1 thiamine Deficiency causes beriberi. Symptoms of this disease of the nervous system include weight loss, emotional disturbances, Wernicke's encephalopathy (impaired sensory perception), weakness and pain in the limbs, periods of irregular heartbeat, and edema (swelling of bodily tissues). Heart failure and death may occur in advanced cases. Chronic thiamine deficiency can also cause Korsakoff's syndrome, an irreversible psychosis characterized by amnesia and confabulation. <br>  Vitamin B2 riboflavin Deficiency causes ariboflavinosis. Symptoms may include cheilosis (cracks in the lips), high sensitivity to sunlight, angular cheilitis, glossitis (inflammation of the tongue), seborrheic dermatitis or pseudo-syphilis (particularly affecting the scrotum or labia majora and the mouth), pharyngitis, hyperemia, and edema of the pharyngeal and oral mucosa. <br>  Vitamin B3 niacin Deficiency, along with a deficiency of tryptophan causes pellagra. Symptoms include aggression, dermatitis, insomnia, weakness, mental confusion, and diarrhea. In advanced cases, pellagra may lead to dementia and death. <br>  Vitamin B5 pantothenic acid Deficiency can result in acne and paresthesia, although it is uncommon. <br>  Vitamin B6 pyridoxine Deficiency may lead to anemia, depression, dermatitis, high blood pressure (hypertension), water retention, and elevated levels of homocysteine. <br>  Vitamin B7 biotin Deficiency does not typically cause symptoms in adults but may lead to impaired growth and neurological disorders in infants. <br>  Vitamin B9 folic acid Deficiency results in a macrocytic anemia, and elevated levels of homocysteine. Deficiency in pregnant women can lead to birth defects. Supplementation is often recommended during pregnancy. Researchers have shown that folic acid might also slow the insidious effects of age on the brain. <br>  Vitamin B12 cobalamin Deficiency causes macrocytic anemia, elevated homocysteine, peripheral neuropathy, memory loss and other cognitive deficits. It is most likely to occur among elderly people as absorption through the gut declines with age; the autoimmune disease pernicious anemia is another common cause. It can also cause symptoms of mania and psychosis. In rare extreme cases, paralysis can result. <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Related nutrients<br>  Many of the following substances have been referred to as vitamins because they were believed to be vitamins at one time, and they are relevant to vitamin nomenclature in that the numbers that were assigned to them form "gaps" in the series of B-vitamin names.

That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole". It is a natural method, i.e. without drugs. The key is that you should no longer fear the thought of anxiety.

7CTvtek0aa	You need to start off slow 6 minutes tops, and you will have to go everyday if you are fair skinned, so the best thing to do is buy the package that gives you unlimited tanning for one month. I am fair skinned and to make going to the tanning bed worth my time, I have to go everyday until I get a good tan and then I cut back to once or twice a week for maintenance.  But it is VERY important to start off slow cause it is very bad for your skin to burn and it will also slow the process down as you will have to take a while off from tanning.|`|n336SjRiaa	your first time is 7 minutes. the ppl at the tanning booths will tell you.|`|hfFVDSNkaa	i'm in the same boat as you. go slowly at first. 5-8 minutes the first time. but it also depends on the type of tanning bed so be sure to ask the people who work there.
lU1a8VtMaa	Some times this happens to me too.All i can suggest is take a panadol and drink plenty of fluids. I would probably recommend a nice warm bath. It is very un usual that these things do happen and as I'm not a doctor or anything all i can do is recommend things the way i do them in my life. A nice cup of Green tea would help aswell.

But sometimes when you see lumps on people they can be cysts.  ok i dont know how to spell it geez, drawing a blank.  anyways, it can be a cyst that needs to be removed, or it could have been a broken bone that was never fixed, it could be a spider bite that is infected, it can be so many things.  so it is hard to say.  it can also be hives.  many people get hives because they are nervous or because they are alergic to something so i can't really say but those are ideas.|`|U0KtmJOUaa	Extreme body modifications are growing more common.<br>  What you saw was undoubtedly implants of some sort, as there are no square muscles.
GXiCrhVYaa	Hi: This first part I will try to keep as simple as possible. The way Clonazapam works is that if you take one pill, half of the medicine will still be in your body for 15 to 40 hours---depending on the person. So, on average, after taking a pill, in about 24 hours, half of the medicine will be gone from your body. The rest will trickle out over the next few days.<br>  <br>  I don't know how often you get panic attacks---if it is everyday or 2 or 3 times a week. However, panic attacks are not like stomach aches, where you take medicine for a few days and then the stomach aches are gone. Probably, as long as you are troubled by panic attacks, you should keep taking the Clonazapam. I think 2 pills a day is better than 3 pills a day when you are busy. However, I am not a doctor and I don't know you. So I guess you should take your doctor's advice.<br>  <br>  Can you talk to your parents or a school counselor about your panic attacks? That would probably help. Do you get nervous about something and then get a panic attack? This is an important question. You might want to keep track of how you were feeling before the panic attack happened.<br>  <br>  To answer your last question, the Clonazapam should do its stuff when you are are in Indiana. I hope I have answered your questions, and I wish you well.|`|DtIbz0Kkaa	hi.. no.. no drug will stop you having panic attacks if you have only taken it for a bit.... you will have to continue taking this medication for a while.. maybe the rest of your life depending how bad it is..i used to take this drug when i was in hospital for panic attacks... its weriod that he put you on this when your 12... i would have suggested valium... <br>  <br>  clonazapam works buy basically calming your body down therefor not being able to have a panic attack.. but if you stop taking it.. your panic attacks will come back.. <br>  <br>  so.. i suggest keep taking it as the doctor has prescribed. <br>  <br>  sorry if i was no help
VXy7ja5uaa	oye mono is terrible. Usually sore throat doesn't last 2 long. Anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen should help ease pain. Or chloraseptic spray can help numb the pain. Physical pain is what usually lasts, like soreness in the lymph nodes and spleen. I felt that pain for over a year. Along with troubles sleeping. Just try to sleep propping your head up, and maybe try a nasal decongestant. i really hope this helps alittle. feel better! oh also, it can take months for you to actually show symptoms of mono. your doctor can help give you a timeline but I had mono for 7months before i even had a sore throat.
yzKrwvxSaa	apart from nothing, nothing. ive never herd of black squares and never herd of anyone with a problem with taking the braces off and a LOT of my friends have had braces taken off. mostly its joy having braces taken off, not worrying about black squares|`|KMDbQXgfaa	Most dentists now use a bonding agent with fluoride when putting on the brackets. So...no, your teeth should be nice, healthy, and white when you get them off :) <br>  Just keep up a very good dental hygiene habit and everything should be quite alright. And after getting them off, you'll probably have a cleaning so they can make sure all the cement is off and your teeth are nice and shiny. <br>  <br>  Best Wishes! :)|`|KsQnslENaa	When I got my braces off that didn't happen to me. I would say one thing to do to make sure you don't get the squares is to use the dental mouthwash that is specifically made for braces.

KOYC3XkJaa	Depends how bad the burn is. You haven't given enough of a description for me to figure out what degree it is; it's either 1st or 2nd. As a rule, 1st degree burns will not scar, 2nd degree burns will. <br>  If it does scar, the scar will be red initially but will in time fade to white.|`|GX1hvK8Yaa	Stop whining about your dick arm emo kid.|`|Ruifi0GSaa	This is for mild burns. For sever burns, seek medical attention immediately. Before applying any treatment, immerse the burned area of skin in cool, but not ice-cold, water. Alternatively, soak a clean cloth in water and apply to the burn to reduce the sensation of heat; then pat dry with a towel.<br>  Calendula juice: Apply the juice of crushed calendula petals several times a day. Crush the petals in your fingers or use a mortar and pestle for a larger amount.<br>  FYI: Calendula can be found at most Natural Home Food Stores.<br>  Aloe vera gel: Cut a leaf of the aloe vera plant; scoop out the clear gel, and apply it directly to the burn.<br>  Soothing paste: Mix a little baking soda with water to make a thick paste and apply to the burn. Do not use on broken skin.<br>  Quick oil rub; Apply 1 drop of tea-tree or lavender essential oil to the skin and gently massage it in. <br>  Hope that helps, good luck.

AA10606659	There are no negative long term side effects. Studies cant prove any. Unless you already suffer from mental ailments such as: depression, paranoia, schizophrenia, bi-polar, or anything else, you might not have a great time. If you have a family history of said mental ailments, watch out, as with ANY mind altering substance you run the risk of accentuating these flaws.

I'm 5'2 and just a month ago i was 208lbs, but since i've been working out, and changed my diet, i'm now down to 188. What ever you do, stay away from those free trials because they don't work, and they are just a scam to charge your account, trust me i've been there. You should also try a detox once a week. I personally find epsom salt and water the best way to detox your body. I've lost 2 inches off my waist line.

I got my period a couple of months when I first started getting them and then I didn't get them the next couple of months.

Do you seek art to remedy your moods?<br>  <br>  You might be neurotic.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroticism</a><br>  <br>  This is not a bad thing- it's a normal thing, just a classification of how  your brain works.<br>  <br>  The upside is that you might be every empathetic, and can "Read" people's emotions, and are able to communicate on levels that other people do not notice (body language, voice tones, etc) and it's this level of unconscious communication that you pick up and transfer to yourself for "processing".<br>  <br>  The downside is that you find yourself an emotion sponge when you dint' want to be.<br>  <br>  <br>  You will have to find mental tricks to stop the absorption effect- where you get the actual emotion data without feeling the emotion yourself.<br>  <br>  One mental exercise is to imagine a bubble barrier around yourself, and you "instruct" it to only allow certain things in.   By sitting down, and figuring out what you want out of an interface with another person, you can help the block and filter of this data.<br>  <br>  You can get practices by watching a good "boo-hoo" movie.  Make your bubble before hand- concentrate on what you want to get in and what you don't, and then see if it works.

As an example of food exposure, my husband ate organic yogurt and because it is less processed, there are more estrogens in it. He started to cry for some stupid reason, and he never ever cries for any reason. <br>  <br>  So you can start by eliminating foods that contain high amounts of hormones and see how you feel. That includes all dairy products, beef and chicken products. As well, there are foods that naturally remove estrogens from the body, like broccoli and brussle sprouts and anything else in the same family as broccoli. <br>  <br>  I personally take an herbal supplement which contains extracts of many different plants known to modulate estrogen levels and it is called Estrosense. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|3vl6LZywaa	Well if you feel that way the only thing i can suggest is something like shock thearapy bring yourself into situations that woul normaly make you cry or get upset and hold it back, might work....<br>  but personality i think it probably means that your just a good person at heart....Adn you realize what life actually has to offer...Don't be shy about crying over stupid things, even if someone teases you over it, it just means they have insucurities about themselves..<br>  This could also be a hormonal imbalance...talk to your doctor...|`|hvhYXJvEaa	if you where a "mamas boy" when you grow up you tend to be more emotional then others and if thats not the case then your just more emotional then others (some girls dig that) so now to the solution hmmmmmmmmm i dont have one <br>  <br>  im sorry about the solution couldn't think of anything|`|VrFa37q3aa	i think its good for a guy to show his sensitive side! don't worry, nbd|`|a8ea9deb7ab29f8f7b54263085c0e342aa	You're not alone.. my nephew is about 35, and struggles like you do.<br>  He takes anti depressants for it, on and off.<br>  Generaly, besides anxiety and depression, some of us, male or female, feel our emtions more than others.<br>  If u see my question right on here, I am so sick at this moment, but thank god for net, cos I feel at least I am doing something to counter my panic, and anxiety, by being on here.<br>  See if your Dr wil try you on a low dose anti depressant, Lexapro was my miracle drug for 8 months.

The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|xXPNWOCZaa	Ephedra Products are the most effective weight loss products, such as Green Stinger Ephedra or Ultimate Burn. They are both extremely powerful featuring 27mg of Ephedra Extract and manufactured by Schwartz Labs.<br>  <br>  Ephedra Products are no longer formulated with ephedrine alkaloids. They were banned in August of 2006 and illegal in the United States. However, they are now formulating them with ephedra viridis and the labels may read ephedra viridis, mormon tea or ephedra extract.<br>  <br>  The new ephedra formula are still highly effective, especially when you find one with other fat burning ingredients, such as the products I mentioned above. You can still buy ephedra products online, through web-sites like Ephedra-Products.com.<br>  <br>  When you used ephedra diet pills in conjuction with a decent diet and exercise, you'll be amazed with the results that you receive.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|R5shu188aa	The term overweight signifies different things to different people. It's a good idea to set off at the beginning, and establish if you are in reality overweight for your size or not, by working out your BMI (Body Mass Index). To be honest, the only diet that really delivered for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a few free trials in stock, it has been featured in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off twenty five pounds, it really does produce success!
zSkC7hsGaa	If you are on a good program you will loose an average of 1-2 lbs a week. do the math. If you are consistent you will see a difference in you appearance in 4-6 weeks. As you exercise you will get smaller but the numbers on the scale may stay the same, because you will be replacing the fat with muscle. Muscle weighs more but it also gets your metabolism fired up. <br>  The boob part yep, they will get smaller probably about B cup. If that is a scary thought, get this, most clothing is designed for a B cup person.

I love these!<br>  <a href="http://www.azoproducts.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.azoproducts.com/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Urinary tract infections can be painful, but you can take steps to ease your discomfort until antibiotics clear the infection. Follow these tips:<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water to dilute your urine and help flush out bacteria.<br>  <br>  Urinate frequently.<br>  <br>  Avoid coffee, alcohol, and soft drinks containing citrus juices and caffeine until your infection has cleared. They can irritate your bladder and tend to aggravate your frequent or urgent need to urinate.<br>  <br>  Drink 100% Cranberry juice (no juice mixes) or take cranberry pills.<br>  <br>  Use a heating pad on your abdomen to minimize bladder pressure or discomfort.<br>  <br>  Prevention<br>  Take these steps to reduce your risk of urinary tract infections: <br>  <br>  Drink plenty of liquids, especially water. Cranberry juice may have infection-fighting properties. However, don't drink cranberry juice if you're taking the blood-thinning medication warfarin. Possible interactions between cranberry juice and warfarin may lead to bleeding. <br>  Wipe from front to back. Doing so after urinating and after a bowel movement helps prevent bacteria in the anal region from spreading to the vagina and urethra. <br>  Empty your bladder as soon as possible after intercourse. Also, drink a full glass of water to help flush bacteria. <br>  Avoid potentially irritating feminine products. Using deodorant sprays or other feminine products, such as douches and powders, in the genital area can irritate the urethra.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Cranberry tablets because they contain no sugar which is worse for those infections, they also have over the counter pain relievers expecially for uti and bladder infections and Colloidal Silver which will clear it up is a natural antibiotic.<br>  <br>  I use to get them all the time.|`|38KXhJPiaa	LOL...I'm going through the same thing right now!!!

And I bought a huge bottle of Cranberry juice (make sure it's 100% juice though and not a concentrate or juice cocktail).<br>  <br>  As soon as I got home, I ate something, took 2 pills and have been drinking TONS of water and cranberry juice. Although the pain is still  there when I do go to the bathroom, my frequency to have to pee is much less than what it was. <br>  <br>  The pain probably won't go away for a day or two, so I'm just going to have to deal with it. But this would be a start for you and it should hold you over until Monday.<br>  <br>  Good luck....I'm with ya!<br>  <br>  Oh, and I did hear that mixing a teaspoon of Baking Soda with water helps fight the infection.

A pregnant woman can't get pregnant by different sperm, only one, nor will sex disrupt the pregnancy. It could, however, trigger labor if a woman is far enough in her pregnancy. <br>  <br>  -Blood is blood; but the blood in your period is from the lining of your uterus. Everyone's blood is made up of the same protein and material; I could go into blood types but that's a different story. So, really, is your period blood the same from your arms/legs? Yes and no. :P (I hope it makes sense!) <br>  <br>  -Test tube babies? Well, the closest thing I can think of is an egg being fertilized outside of the woman's body. A doctor can remove eggs from a woman using fertility drugs and tools, and can collect sperm from a man. They can then fertilize an individual egg inside a lab. Then they insert the egg back inside the woman's uterus, hoping that it will implant and continue developing. That's more accurately called invitro-fertilization.|`|yJ31VS79aa	Nothing, you may cause a miscarriage or pre-mature labor.<br>  The only difference is that the blood for your period is mixed with other fluids and pieces of tissue.<br>  Test tube babies are when egg and sperm are collected. Then they are mixed together and then placed inside the womb. It is a good option if either they egg or sperm has a defect|`|UsezqNARaa	Nothing happens if u have sex while preggers.

dkEUJPhnaa	Going without cutting for a month and 1 day is fantastic, you should be proud of what you have done. I know how hard it can be to resist the urge - especially when problems overwhelm us and we want to go back to our old habits.

Keep fighting and it'll be worth it, just keep believing in yourself.|`|ToILKl6waa	Do not convince yourself that cutting with solve your problems. It is only provides temporary relief, and it is hazardous your health beyond that. Use other effective ways to cope such as drawing, writing, yoga, etc. Running also is proven to release a portion of anxiety. Relax and realize that things could always be worse.

sQu3LLqtaa	Perhaps you could include some fattening nuts in your diet.  They make good snacks and the unsaturated fats in nuts are healthy fats.  <br>  <br>  Nuts are also rich in potassium, magnesium, iron and zinc and almonds, walnuts and hazel nuts also contain a reasonable amount of calcium.|`|d6YEEtSzaa	If that's your natural weight then be happy. Trust me, guys don't like fatties.|`|qeMGlx4qaa	Ensure won't help to much. My nutritionist told me she tells people who want to gain weight to drink 8oz of orange juice(or any fruit juice) 3x a day(one with each meal if you'd like) <br>  Juices are loaded with calories and our brains think its water so it doesn't tell our bodies to turn them, which means free calories. it will help you put weight on.
mePPZXAsaa	They don't bother me much no. Just don't look at them when you are about to get it done. Avert your eyes.

33E71Ka3aa	No it is actually normal. We all should go to the bathroom that much. Your body is flushing all the toxins out this is good for you. Did you know it is not normal to have a bowel movement every other day? It is normal to have a BM three times a day. That means every meal should have a BM. If you are not getting a BM at least twice a day there is some problem with your colon or maybe they should buy some products that will help flush out toxins. Did you know the having frequent bowel movements help you live longer. So keep it up you are on a good start.|`|bZwABbpNaa	Your probably eating healthier foods that are rich in fiber and they're cleaning you out.<br>  Don't worry, its healthy.<br>  And good luck with your diet. :)|`|fyvVPn6Xaa	depending on the diet, you could be eating more fiber, or more, small meals a day. either way you should be fine|`|cGnIZ7kfaa	once a day?<br>  man, thats not good.<br>  3 poops a day is healthy. <br>  especially if they are big ones.|`|TrHXtOdYaa	It is very healthy to use the bathroom more than once a day.

3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|9XmJPjXvaa	read this article about burn the fat feed the muscle<br>  <br>  <a href="http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/2009/02/burn-fat-feed-muscle.html" rel="nofollow">http://loseweightin14days.blogspot.com/2...</a>|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|Z2TJbrKeaa	You need to start a good total body training program.Look on youtube for some good instructional videos.
qeMGlx4qaa	Skipping Breakfast actually HURTS your body. The fun exercise is awesome, but eat in the morning. Cereal is not a good breakfast! try yogurt, fruit, and your favorite nuts(maybe a total of 10, they will help your body actually use the nutrients in the fruit). If you really want to put on a little weight, drink 8oz of fruit juice 3x a day, free calories! your brain thinks it is water and won't burn them :)|`|kgLBJs6Gaa	your not eating 3 meal a day is why.|`|blIYKrViaa	SKIP BREAKFAST!!!<br>  Hello, it's looking at you right in the face.  You need to incorporate food into your life, unless you want to be underweight.|`|c55O7jqXaa	Ok first thing for people who say they don't have an eating disorder, but yet say I have one sandwich a day and then don't mention any food that you eat at school. Also you don't mention any of the portions and exactly what it is that you are eating and you are spending all your time exercising- dancing, walking.<br>  <br>  This is classic of exercising anorexia. You may not be "starving" yourself per say, but you are burning off way more calories than you are putting into your body. <br>  <br>  What junk food? When, what, and how much are you eating per day? <br>  <br>  You are in denial and this always happens. How do I know because I have had it myself for many many years and finally came to the realization and got help. Now I am a happy and still thin person because I come by it naturally, but I no longer exercise like that and eat regularly. I don't worry about junky stuff so much, but I try to eat healthy for my health. I do not skip breakfast. That is the most important meal of the day. This is what a typical diet should consist of almost anyone. <br>  <br>  Breakfast<br>  <br>  A bowl of oatmeal with fresh fruit or nuts and water and maybe even some fresh juice. <br>  <br>  Snack of fresh fruit, energy bar or breakfast bar or handful of nuts and dried fruits<br>  <br>  Lunch<br>  <br>  Salad with all the veggies you can think of with a lean meat like chicken, fish, seafood, tuna, etc with a lighter dressing<br>  <br>  Or <br>  <br>  A sandwich on whole wheat bread with lean meat like turkey, chicken, or tuna with as many veggies as you can pack on.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  a veggie soup and half of sandwich<br>  <br>  afternoon snack<br>  fruit or veggies and dip or nuts, or dried fruits or smoothie<br>  <br>  Dinner light before 5 if possible or no later than 6 or 7 pm. <br>  <br>  A lean meat, veggie. starch<br>  <br>  Water thru out the whole day. <br>  <br>  Now you can vary this whether you need to loose weight or gain weight. <br>  <br>  This is just an example of what a normal person on a heath conscience diet would eat. <br>  <br>  YOu are just ay too thin for your height. <br>  <br>  I am 5'4 and weigh 100-105 pounds and I am underweight and you are 5'11 and only 10-15 pounds more than me? I don't think so. You are skin and bones even if you are small boned this is not normal.<br>  <br>  Now if you are truly eating more than you mention on here then I suggest you get to the doctor asap and find out what is wrong. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to a pysch and get this eating problem and your over exercising under control before you get eal sick and wind up in the hospital.<br>  <br>  I guarantee you will be ticked off at what the nurses and doctors make you eat in the hospital and how close of a watch they do on you and if you try to hide food or vomit it or anything they will know and immediately threaten the tube or IV. Not fun and believe me there are some pretty messed up people in those clinics. <br>  <br>  You do not want to get to that point. You get the help now and really stop lying to yourself and others and just own up to it and get that help. <br>  <br>  Get rid of the scales. This is a big step. Once you can do that seek help. This is something that is very difficult to overcome on your own. <br>  <br>  Seek God's guidance too. I wish you the best and please please please get help. You do clearly have something going on whether it be the eating disorder or some underlying cause that makes you not want to eat and lose weight.

l0ddfca1aa	Well, I'm Mexican American and I would say that Mexicans do tend to be shorter on average than whites. However, Mexican Americans (born in the US) tend to be taller than Mexicans who were born in Mexico because of differences in lifestyle. I have three sisters and they're all 5ft4. Anyway, 5ft 2 is petite but it's not a problem if you're female because alot of guys actually prefer shorter than taller girls so dont worry about it :)|`|6GWctkQzaa	No, unless you get cosmetic leg lengthening or something like that.

Look at your mom, that's probably gonna be your height. <br>  But yeah, Mexican women don't tend to get very tall. They tend to be shorter and curvier than their Nordic counterparts. <br>  But be thankful, at 13, I was 5'10 and couldn't find pants long enough to save my life.|`|GvQHw4Ntaa	I don't believe it does.. there are extremes (short and tall) among all races, while the majority of the population tends to be about average.

1Sdacs28aa	Yes, phytoestrogens, in high amounts, are very bad for you. They can screw around with your thyroid, studies have demonstrated that the accelerate the growth of tumors and cause cancer--in men, the damage is particularly centered around the prostate, and there are numerous studies linking overconsumption of soy [and thus phytoestrogens] to a phenomenally higher risk of Alzheimer's.<br>  <br>  I can't find much info on phytoandrogens, however it appears that hibiscus is high in them [used in Indian cuisine].<br>  <br>  I'm not trying to scare you, just answer your questions. Whey protein is a much better choice for protein than soy!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your diet! ^_^

aklfeolIaa	dont do the hydroxycut, have 25g of protein 30 mins before your workout, eat a banana and 50g of whey after your workout. then eat a meal 50 mins later. drink plenty of water. cycle the creatine every 6 weeks, just 5g before and after. 8 hours of sleep. run at least 20 mins 4-5 days a week. youll be tip top in no time<br>  <br>  NO ONE KNOWS ANYTHING ABOUT BUILDING MUSCLE! Rebbeca, go online and do some research before this kid actually believes you only need 7 grams of protein before and after a workout. WOW!|`|qeMGlx4qaa	Do weight training, and eat 7g of protein within 30 minutes of your workout, get rid of the pills! they won't help you, only hinder your body. Remember you won't see a change in weight right away but your body will become much more toned. Weight train 3x a week(Max of 3x a week, your muscles need to rest) do cardio in the days off if you want to. Mix your workouts up, try new things! The number one way to get rid of fat is to work your muscles! and remember you only need 7g of protein within 30 minutes, that tells your body to make muscle, anything over that and it is only hindering you. Good Luck!|`|qQCbP6pKaa	That is a bad mix....Hydroxycut cuts water weight and creatine want to flood your muscle with water...the supplements you are taking are counteracting each other...basically your wasting the supplement...go on one and off the other.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.charleslloydfitness.com</a><br>  <a href="http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com</a>|`|YUXvCttVaa	You will be fine man,!

Not to mention taking them together could damage your organs.|`|mqXyDTwwaa	Whey protein is just additional calories. If you want to lose fat, you don't need more calories.
mqXyDTwwaa	No. Sumo wrestlers eat one meal a day. Seriously.|`|sQu3LLqtaa	If you consume all your calories at breakfast time you will either lose weight or stay the same.<br>  <br>  If you consume all your calories at dinner time you will either gain weight or stay the same.<br>  <br>  Breakfast calories are less fattening than dinner calories as with most of the day ahead of you they are likely to be burned up whereas dinner calories are unlikely to be burned up with most of the day behind you.<br>  <br>  These findings were the result of an experiment that was conducted some considerable time ago.|`|blIYKrViaa	OMG don't starve urself.<br>  eat a big hearty breakfast (like a veggie omelet or whole grain fiber cereal)... and it'll keep you going throughout the whole day!|`|c55O7jqXaa	Sure you can, but it is not a wise thing to do. You would have to continue to do this for a long time and once you start eating things normally again the weight will just come back. <br>  <br>  It is better to lose weight by changing your lifestyle and not dieting. <br>  <br>  You do this by trying to elimate as much stress as you can, spending time relaxing or relaxing your mind, increasing your ater intake along with eating fresh vegetables or frozen, fresh or frozen fruits, leans meats, whole grains. Do not skip breakfast. People that skip breakfast tend to eat more at lunch or during the day. Get out and walk. Walking is one of the best exercises you can do. It is easy on the body, gets your heart rate up, and just helps you relax.<br>  <br>  People that go on these diets should know by now they just don't work no matter what people say- DIETING DOES NOT WORK PEOPLE, but what does work is healthy eating and everything in moderation. Moderation is the key.<br>  <br>  Now what you can do and will help is eating several smalls meals a day instead of sitting down to a meal snacking thru out the day is better for you. Keeps your blood sugars level and also helps to speed up motabolism.|`|9561bcd46074a595a29a583e0bb9f89caa	Maybe, but for the moment. If you start doing this, you have to do it forever. Why? Because your body will be used to only recieving one meal a day, so your metabolism will slow. Once you start eating normally again, your body will then absorb it all and you'll weigh even more than you do now.<br>  Healthiest way to lose weight and that you can keep doing is having a very big, healthy breakfast then having very small snacks along the day (like salads, sandwiches, fruits, etc)|`|zzkmdusEaa	Not the healthy way. A diet isn't really much of a diet if your staying unhealthy. Thats dangerously close to anorexia. Ever seen what happens when humans become malnourished? Not fun at all.|`|sPT8ikgXaa	For the first few days you will...but then your body will start to go into "survival mode" where its not getting enough food/nutrition, so it will begin to store every little bit that you do eat, which in the long run you will notice your weight not changing, or even an increase.  Eat a healthy breakfast/lunch/dinner and stay active or some exercise and you can lose weight.<br>  <br>  Just an interesting story I wanted to add: There was a woman I read about in a health magazine, who did not change her lifestyle and didn't exercise...the ONLY thing she did different was that she did not eat any fast food for 1 month...and lost 28 pounds.  I myself tried it, I did not have any fast food for 2 weeks and I lost 4 pounds.|`|1KqknaUHaa	Maybe.<br>  <br>  but you might actually gain weight because after 4 - 6 hours of not eating food your body starts to think it's going to starve so a whole day in between meals wouldn't necessarily mean you will lose weight.<br>  Try eating like a healthy granola bar every few hours or fruit every few hours and you will for sure lose weight. <br>  & exercise is always good!|`|pcS73lKGaa	Don;t worry so much about how much u eat as opposed to what you eat.  Salads standard size for one portion is like 25 calories without like dressing and stuff.  Lower your carb intake (and avoid sugary cereals very unhealthy for u) and consume about 1500 calories per day.  If you do cardio 30 min a day at least 3 times a week you will see results.  Also avoid eating food after 9 p.m.  Good luck :)|`|PaVyuYVUaa	no. the best way to loose weight is to 3 three healthy meals a day and at least 2 snacks a day. and DEFINITELY WORK OUT EACH DAY AT LEAST A HALF HOUR. starving your self will do the opposite. you pig out when you eat and then starve and your calories that you eat turn into fat unless you work out which burns them, but that means you need a lot of fuel! please don't starve yourself. hope this helps|`|15jfF0tKaa	Thats way severe try shape/fit.com   They have a dietitian that emails you right back about your food questions.  But energy foods are filling and low calorie.  Like oatmeal in the am with berries. and a glass of milk.  A turkey sandwich for lunch with an apple and a glass of milk, a bowl of soup and salad for supper   Now that is a healthy reducing diet especially if you walk a couple of miles or shut your bedroom door and do aerobics to music. good luck!|`|BNrQSYwhaa	You will,but thats not a healthy diet.You need Calories for energy,If you skip meals you will not have energy and your body needs nutrients to develop   properly.Exercise and Healthy eating is a better alternative.|`|bAbHo8moaa	of course and in the future when you decide you want to eat more than one meal a day you'll gain all the weight you lost plus some.|`|MF9YknDYaa	No|`|vjqqvG3Uaa	People need to realize that if you don't supply the body with enough nutrients, then your metabolism slows way down as a survival instinct.<br>  <br>  Sure you will lose some weight from 1 meal a day but eventually you'll see it coming off slower and slower because your body is gonna start trying to survive. It also starts to break down important parts too like your muscles.<br>  <br>  You can do small meals 6-8 times a day or even just 2 but make them healthy meals.|`|WrctoEyMaa	Yes, it might take a while but you will lose weight. But this is probably one of the worst ways to do it. To put it simple, when your body doesn't get the nutrients it needs pretty soon it starts to rely on your food storage. Your body has to work hard to break down the fat, and that releases something called ketones into your blood stream. Ketones speed up dehydration, and make you feel very tired and sluggish.  If you really want to lose weight you have to work at it. It's not easy but I've tried not eating much, and although I lost weight I felt awful. And I've gained back the weight that I lost because when I finally started eating normally again my body was still in panic mode and saved everything it could just in case it wouldn't get any later.|`|BfBMRlNNaa	Nope you sure won't. If you don't eat regularly, your body goes into "starvation mode" and stores fat because it doesn't know when it will get nourishment again. The key is to eat small, healthy meals 5-6 times a day. Eat lots of fresh veggies and fruits, whole grains, and nuts and add some protein like chicken and fish. Drink water and increase your exercise, even if it's just walking more - and you will lose weight.|`|ConSDYyvaa	The key for losing weight is simple - eat less food and workout more - the problems surface when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are plenty of temptations in the real world aren't there?! The one thing which really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it has been reported in Reader's Digest and USA Today. I melted away twenty pounds, it really does produce results!|`|AA11485682	Not necessarily. If you starve yourself, your body makes it harder to lose fat because it thinks that you're in a famine and need fat reserves. It's better to eat smaller meals during the day than one large one.<br>  <br>  And if you're having trouble losing weight, a good and easy way to do it is to only drink water. You'd be surprised how much that one little change can help.|`|Y4ZjGCr4aa	No way!!!! You should be eating a lot (on healthy foods). Trust me, trying to skip meals is not a good way to lose weight. Make sure to also get plenty of exercise, probably 60 minutes a day, but it depends on your age.|`|kgLBJs6Gaa	yeah but you can get really sick if you do that.

It turned out I had PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome) and hypothyroidism, which are both endocrine disorders that can result in weight gain, and also mess up periods. <br>  If you're not pregnant, you need to see a doctor and have them do some labwork to check your hormone/endocrine levels.|`|dyUOnaPuaa	My friend experienced this.

sPT8ikgXaa	Because sometimes your body's immune system will get rid of these abnormal cells, and if it does, then great, in 6 months they will know you don't have anything serious and don't have to take any further action.  If they tested you again in 2 weeks for example, that is not enough time for your body's immune system to get rid of it.  If after 6 months it is abnormal again, that is when they may do further testing or other procedures.|`|AA12131791	Could be a number of reasons why it came up abnormal.  Doesn't mean its bad.

The body is very resilient and if you have a good immune system, it will keep cancer clumps from forming in your body.  Everyone has cancer cells but most people's bodies will get rid of them.  Those people who have cancer usually notice a hard lump caused by the grouping together of these cells.  If you are worrying so much, go to the doctor and rule out what you think you might have.

OaQWUfNoaa	No. It is actually part of the opening of the vagina- if you use a mirror you may be able to see it. Anyone who tells you that it is inside of your body (the worst I've seen is someone claiming it was "way up in the womb") is ignorant.

zKGQL8Ekaa	This is actually not a new technology.  A family was microchiped in 2002. (See link below) Not addressing the sign of the Anti-Christ, which I believe it would be, and just sticking with my personal opinion, the only way I would consider being microchiped is if it were an optional procedure that could be taken out at anytime.  I can see where it could have its benefits for lost children, elderly, soldiers, medical records etc. but at the same time I see that it can have the potential to be abused and  also be an invasion of personal privacy.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/security/news/2002/02/50187" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/politics/security/n...</a>|`|GoWPQvgHaa	I think it would help with identifying dead soldiers, but Im not too certain that I would want one.

If you have never smoked it or at least haven't in a very long time then you'll have a low tolerance to it and the effects may be more extreme than expected. <br>  <br>  Smoking it VS. Eating it! <br>   This really depends on the person. Some people hate to smoke and would rather eat it to get the effects even though smoking it is much easier plus the effects are almost instant and more potent while ingesting it takes allot longer but the effects last much longer but are not quite as potent. Smoking it is over-kill getting you much higher than eating it would which will make you have a higher tolerance which means you will need to smoke more than you usually would to get the same high as before if used frequently. Why people put hash in brownies and sweet buttery types of food and such is really because the active ingredient (THC) is only soluble in oils (not water based foods) therefore it stores very well and intensifies a little bit as it saturates over time.<br>  <br>   All in all, the effects of eating hash brownies would be about the same as smoking it despite how much longer it takes and lasts. I recommend at least smoking it first because you can inhale just a tad bit at a time to see how it effects you to tell whether you even like that type of buzz or not. I know people that hate it and people that love it depends on how well you can tolerate such a strange mind altering effect. It's not a big huge high where you can barely walk it's actaully very suttle and is hands down the best relaxant known to man.Why it is illegal in most places is a long story but that hasn't stopped people from getting it and it never will because it's just too damn good =)|`|rseR7Camaa	you get an all over, full body high that lasts for awhile.

If you were to look at a muscle anatomy picture, you will find that what we call love handles are simply our gluteus medius which goes up and connects to the external obliques and goes down to and forms the gluteus maximus which is connected to your lats. Doing the following will help with the entire area to tighten and tone up your muscles and help burn the fat around them. Hope all of this helps do lunges, step-up kickbacks, walking downhill, running, leg raises without weight or very light weight, yoga, push ups, lat pull downs, pull ups rowing, and deadlifts.

You need to eat less and exercise more. The reason why there's only one solution for all of these problems is because it's impossible to tell your body where to burn the excess fat from.<br>  <br>  When you eat too many calories, your body stores the excess energy as fat in different areas around the body. To lose this fat, you need to create a calorie deficit (eat less than you burn) to force your body to start burning that fat for energy. There is absolutely no way to control where your body goes to find this extra fat. <br>  <br>  The larger your calorie deficit (a bigger calorie deficit means a bigger difference between what you eat and what you burn) the faster your body will burn excess fat and the quicker your body fat percentage will start to decrease. You can increase your calorie deficit by cutting your daily intake and exercising more. Sit ups will do nothing to target the fat around your abs just like squats will do nothing to target the fat around your thighs. You can read more about fixing your trouble spots at the Guide to Reducing Body Fat - <a href="http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/reducebodyfat.html" rel="nofollow">http://straighthealth.com/pages/guides/r...</a>|`|cKSbZBt8aa	Eat more vegetables for fibre to fight fat tissue.  Stay away from sugar foods and sugar drinks.  Sit-ups and leg raise during add breaks on TV, also push-ups for upper body tone and strength.  More protein foods (fish, chicken, nuts, beans) for metabolism and muscle health.  You can do it, keep going.

I am suprised that he hasn't done this already.<br>  This is a pretty standard procedure that is safe and effective. Truly a Pain specialist is the doctor she should be seeing.
0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	Hi. I have a baclofen/bupivacaine pump for muscle spasticity and pain associated with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. I'm on fairly high doses of oral oxycodone, but unfortunately can't have more drugs added to my pump because of being on a very large baclofen dose - as it is, I require refills every four weeks.<br>  <br>  Trial - no big deal. You spend a few days in hospital and have a few trial injections into your spine - like having an epidural - just to see if the drug helps you. Only this will tell you how well you're going to function with the pump. They may decide to use a placebo at some point just to be sure. <br>  <br>  Surgery - usually isn't that long (I think I was only three hours from being taken off and waking up in recovery), and I didn't find the surgery too bad at all. I think that when you live with severe pain, a little bit extra isn't really that noticable.<br>  <br>  Side effects - Not only does an intrathecal pump mean that you need a much lower dose of the drug, it is also much more targeted. Because it is delivered straight to your spinal fluid where it is needed, it doesn't go through the rest of your body as it would if you were taking it as a tablet or transdermal patch. This means that the chance of side effects is much, much lower. <br>  <br>  The device itself - it's one of the most uncomfortable things I've ever experienced. If not for the difference the drugs make, I'd have it taken out again. I'm on the short side and very skinny (5'4 and 43kg) and it's definitely a problem. I have pretty much the full thickness of the pump protruding from my abdomen and I find that whenever I lean forwards it has a tendency to hit me in either the ribs or the top of my pelvis. I also have a lump where the catheter enters my spine (just from where it passes over the bone) and that too is uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  Refills - I have some pain now because mine is being refilled so often and the bruising doesn't always go away in between fills. But really, it's not bad. Uncomfortable rather than painful, and only for a few seconds as the needle is popped through.<br>  <br>  I hope that gives you something of an answer. You're more than welcome to email me if you have any other questions.|`|AA11885973	You can keep doing what your doing and keep getting what your getting, or you can try something different and get different results.  Bottom line - it's your decision, girlfriend.
XL3gqhVxaa	If your ears hurt more when you move your head certain ways, you may have an ear infection. It's generally recommended that you get checked out by a doctor whenever it's possible that you have an ear infection, but since it's the weekend, that may prove a bit difficult. In the meantime, keep your ears warm to help soothe the pain. I suggest using a heating pad for this, but don't sleep with it turned on, since you risk it getting too hot and burning you. A lot of people like to use ear drops or warmed olive oil (among other things) to help with the pain, but it's not entirely safe to do that unless you're 100% sure your eardrum is intact. (Sometimes it ruptures- if there's fluid leaking out of your ears, that's a good indication that it has, but sometimes there's no way to tell on your own, so get it checked.) For the cold, try using traditional cold remedies like eating soup, drinking tea, and inhaling steam/vapour to loosen any congestion (which can also help your ears). Also, try to stay home and rest as much as possible; being very active and engaging in stressful activities certainly won't help the situation. I know how horrible this is to endure, so I hope you start feeling better soon.|`|f6XwjtvPaa	breath in soft and hold your nose when your gonna sneeze and then rub your ears
AA10003191	Not to be a smart #$$, but he knows a bit more about MRI than you do.<br>  Adding contrast to an MRI (or CT) doesn't necessarily make it "better". It just brings out different things. <br>  <br>  BTW, an MRA does use contrast. It uses Gadolinium to outline the blood vessels in the brain.<br>  <br>  As I always tell patients, if you don't understand a test, ASK!

It also didn't taste too bad. I hope you feel better =)|`|PRzmwFfgaa	Stick to the ginger ale and crackers until atleast tomorrow afternoon.  You can try to sip on some peppermint tea.  That is pretty much your safest bet.  You can also try some plain bread.  Pretty much anything outside of that will come back up.  Sorry.|`|jaGU3zyyaa	I agree with Timothy.  Ginger tea will help, also.  Or, just stick with the ginger ale and crackers for now.  Tomorrow you will be much better.  Good Luck.

GblxshkTaa	It could be a reaction to something...<br>  first try switching to a gentle (or just different) face wash and see if they go away within 1-2 weeks. If nothing happens, it is probably not that.<br>  <br>  If it is not facewash, it could be a lotion or other treatment you are putting on your face.  Try switching the lotion/treatment and again wait 1-2 weeks.  <br>  <br>  Finally, if you still don't know what it is...<br>  (if you are a guy)<br>  try switching razor/shaving cream/aftershave and see if that does not solve the problem.<br>  <br>  If any of that does not work for you then try to apply an intense moisturizer - I recommend The Body Shop - they have amazing face lotion for guys and girls.  <br>  <br>  It really sounds like a reaction to me, but maybe your skin is just dry.  It is winter, after all.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope your skin clears!|`|4BBjhHAnaa	Umm . . . acne?  Use face wash.
nrTVlo8Eaa	When I had it, I distinctly remember feeling terribly run down and headachy for weeks; moping around asking people if they thought I had a fever.<br>  <br>  Finally, when I started throwing up repeatedly and begging my [now ex]husband to go buy me a thermometer [fever was over 103], he took me to a Patient First type place, and sure enough my "mono spot" came back positive immediately, meaning I'd been sick with mono for a little while.<br>  <br>  The nausea lasted for at least a week; this was because my liver was swollen from the mono. I also had jaundice to the point where people kept looking funny at me. The fatigue was extreme and it was impossible to work. I was out of work for around 6 weeks.<br>  <br>  The nausea abated, however, I remember having a really sensitive stomach with a weird appetite for about four months.|`|AA10738539	Check:<br>  <a href="http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000591.htm#Symptoms" rel="nofollow">http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/...</a>|`|v91ktMHdaa	You will know if you have mono, Most likely you will be sleeping 18+ hours a day for multiple days.

NvGqiA4vaa	Yes there are 'rehab' centers for people with eating disorders. There are many (well, not many, but more than, say, 4 or 5) across the country. Some are specifically for eating disorders and some are like psychiatric treatment facilities that also treat eating disorders. I don't believe there's a minimum or maximum age to be able to stay at a facility, but if you're wondering if you can stay there if you're under 18, then yes you definitely can.<br>  <br>  As for cost, they are usually pretty expensive. And medical insurance rarely covers it. Though many places are willing to compromise/negotiate with families for a lower place. If you search in google (or another search engine) for 'eating disorder treatment centers' or something similar, you can find more information about specific ones and their costs.

BlMNm9Ccaa	Weight Watchers worked great for my wife. She lost about about 50 lbs and is in the maintenance mode at this time - now weighs about 130 lbs. She lost most of the weight in the first 6 months and has kept it off for 2 years now. She did incorporate exercise into her diet as well, but not much in the beginning, maybe 30 minute walk on the treadmill 3 times a week. Now she is "addicted" to the exercise. At least an hour a day on the treadmill, sit-ups, light weight training, exercise DVD's, zoomba...did I mention she is addicted? LOL...<br>  <br>  Here is a site that I'm making to make it easier for her when eating out...<br>  <br>  <a href="http://completepointcounter.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://completepointcounter.blogspot.com...</a>|`|ZLt8TwOiaa	Yes , I have had great successon Weight Watchers, it not only teaches you how to eat healthy and portion control but a whole lot more. It's a life style not a diet and its something you can do for the rest of your life.
TODzjTczaa	Yes, it's REALLY bad.  When you don't eat enough, your body decides that you're starving, and it goes into emergency ultra-conservation mode, where it hordes every single calorie you do eat and puts it into your fat reserves, all the while burning your muscle mass for the energy you need to live.  It's a strategy that works well for our primitive ancestors, who actually did occasionally fail to get enough food -- but for us foolish modern people who deliberately undereat, it backfires and makes us tired, cranky, and fat regardless of our efforts.<br>  <br>  Your best bet is to eat about 2100 calories of meat, vegetables, fruit, and dairy (in that order of importance) -- and eat small meals often, rather than the occasional big meal.  By skipping out on flour and sugar, you tell your body to BURN fat instead of STORE it while it's burning carbs, and by getting a good variety of nutrient-dense foods, you give the body the tools it needs to function properly, which is when you look your best.|`|tZLtCfA4aa	your not going lose any fat weight. sure you'll lose weight but water weight and you'll gain it back in a matter of months. you gotta eat so you can lose the fat weight. at least 4 times a day. they got to be healthy. and you gotta drink lots of water and do alot of excerise.|`|LKFqR3zZaa	Skipping meals just makes you gain weight to be truthful... your body needs calories and proteins to survive. You could simply cut down on what you eat add more protein and "The Good Calories"...also work out. Trust me it will work. You will have awesome results.|`|f25c30444ca9178fb27db060710f1327aa	Heck yes. lol. Seriously don't skip meals. It will screw with your metabolism.|`|ycaloVnkaa	yes it is bad. U have more of a chance of burning muscle. 5'1 120lb doesnt seem greatly overweight. Dont skip meals, instead just eat smaller portions. Definately dont skip a meal before u workout. By the end when u lose all that weight and then u eat sumthing u will prob gain twice as much weight cuz alot of muscle will have been burnt away.|`|t6N64bBYaa	DON'T SKIP MEALS!!! that just makes things even worse! your body is starved of fat so it'll eat your muscle and all that working out will be for nothing. eat well and exercise right but don't overdo it. see a nutritionist if you are having trouble w/ meal plans
5AaMDz91aa	Could be somthing serious.  Make a doctor appointment, asap.
yKZQoLDoaa	It varies for different women, for myself I have had 3, every 2 years for the past 6 years, so I have a 6 year old a 4 year old and a 5 month old. Each time my belly got hard around 5 to 6 months.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	When your belly button turns inside out, about seven months !|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	It takes a good long time before it gets hard.

If you don't have one then no worries what so ever your a lucky guy if you don't (it always gets in the way). <br>  Never feel guilty about masturbating. You should start around 12 or 13 'cause your brain isn't a sh*t head when you get older. Masturbating actually helps keep your prostate healthy (the thing next to you bladder).<br>  Find a private and secure place to do it and try new things.<br>  By new things I mean like fold a pillow in half and go boom boom.<br>  (I use pillows }:))|`|eD51aBzlaa	yes it's normal. i think just about everybody does it.|`|LntUwSucaa	Its really more normal than you think, this way sound wierd to you but I bet every male if your family has done it before you..<br>  when ur freinds mature a bit theyll admit they like it.|`|CFvpHeKdaa	masturbation is normal, and you can masterbate all you want.|`|B4SF8sPraa	"everyone one jerks" should be a book lol like everyone poops? yea.. well everyone touches it some people can even suck their own|`|qCLeLXBWaa	only twice a month <br>  dont start if your not even in high school yet|`|CkdSTD1Baa	of course it is! everyone masturbates. totally normal.|`|3faz90KDaa	yes this is normal<br>  many people do

19loAHyBaa	you need to talk to someone you trust because :happy pills: do jacksh*t if your thoughts arent changing! you cant be all i wanna die im over this life and take pills at the same time. doesnt work that way.<br>  dont think about it as a bad thing think of the outcome once your depression is over your thoughts will be more positive for starters you will not be thinking your bf will break up with you because youll realise you are one awesome chick and any guy would be lucky to have you.<br>  <br>  just stick to the pills talk to a friend and youll be on the road to happiness is no time|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|FszxeECvaa	Take a deep breath|`|h7uxxiZZaa	Get a councilar. talk it threw dont do anything to hurt yourself.

Most likely, the body is producing urine at a faster rate because it is excited and all systems are working faster. Then, after ejaculation, the guy is relaxed and notices that he needs to pee, so he does. I believe that peeing after sex helps both guys and girls avoid urinary tract infections by flushing irritants out of the urethra|`|C7hwAQ22aa	the penis need to cleans the lining of anything that may be "contamanated" so it urinates to clean its self out also it relives the muscles witch causes any tensoin holding urine back to relase causeing to loss the controll over holding it in|`|SIdXuraxaa	Its just the after math of an erection,.|`|CJmSbIuHaa	idk, but my bf does the same thing!<br>  i thought he was just weird...|`|BWYhw5EZaa	i am a girl, and always have to go to the bathroom after, so IDK!
ea2aCkB8aa	Frankly, after reading your post, the details indicicate that it is possible(not confirmed or definitive) that you are showing signs of very mild delusional thinking or the onset of it. This can also be a part of mild schizophrenia or the onset of it. Schizophrenic sufferers experience things like hearing things that other people don't hear, seeing things that people don't really see, having bizzare and strong beliefs and also irrational thoughts, fragmented thoughts, racing thoughts and sometimes even paranoid thoughts. Paranoia consists of suspicious thoughts, thinking others are plotting against you, wanting to harm you or thinking bad about you. In short, delusional and schizophrenic sufferers experience problems in their perception of reality. They perceive reality differently and are often problematically inaccurate.<br>  These changes in perception can occur sometimes and then go away sometimes. Then return again. Beginning stages can be mild and manageable. They can come then disappear again. For some they can be easily treated. Others not. Some don't have it more than once or a few times and lead life as normal aftewards.<br>  It could be that you are suffering stress or just maybe alone alot and thinking too much or analyzing too hard? These also can make you seem more judgemental of yourself and your surroundings? Too much stress also wearies the mind. With rest it may feel more balanced.<br>  <br>  If you more often than normal, obsess over something and repeat things again and again and tends to dwell on the same thoughts over n over, it can be an obsessive compulsive disorder as well. It really depends. I tend to repeat things myself but I don't feel it is an obsessive disorder. Do you feel disturbed by your own behaviours and find you cannot stop even if you wanted? Is it disturbing your friendships and life in general?<br>  The key point is, how much are these thoughts and mental processes disturbing you and disruptive your performance in life?<br>  If you feel disturbed by your thoughts often and regularly have dreams that disturb you, you are suffering from mental disturbance. Cos obviously you're disturbed.<br>  <br>  Pls note that what I have written above is what I've read in some books and I mention them here because your posting above reminds me of some of what I've read about schizophrenia, psychosis and delusional thoughts.<br>  <br>  I emphasize the words mild because I do not think you are 'crazy' or 'mad', in fact I see you are intelligent, coherent and organized in writing out your posting here with quite observant points made.<br>  You have not mentally gone insane to the point of not even being able to read and write etc. So there is hope n thus you should not worry too much.<br>  <br>  If you feel worried, pls read up more websites on mental health, eg delusional thoughts and schizophrenia. See if the symptoms listed matches yours. Try also reading up on paranoia or obsessive compulsive disorders.<br>  <br>  As for the sleeping late at night and going for late walks, that don't necessarily mean you are going insane. Many other people prefer walking when it is quiet and peaceful and now more people also enjoy working late into the night or simply sleeping late due to body clock preferences. Many of these people have no mental problems.<br>  <br>  Pls do not take my answer as a definitive conclusion to your mental state. I am only stating some facts which I find you may be interested in to research on further to draw your own decisions.<br>  All I have written here is based on what you typed in your question details. It does not in anyway represent my opinion of you as a person as I have never met you. Plus, I am not a doctor or psychiatrist.<br>  <br>  Pls take care and be strong. The mind is complex and can overcome many things more than you know. Trust in your inner intelligence and have more self confidence. You are articulate and write well. :-)<br>  <br>  PS: <br>  I want to add that these are the symptoms that you should find out more details about. They can lead to more serious problems if left unattended:<br>  <br>  QUOTE:<br>  <br>  1. I sometimes hear people (involved in my life) saying random things to me, even when they're not there.<br>  <br>  2. I impersonate people and repeat certain phrases to the point of being sick of it (my friends actually challenged me to not impersonate a certain person for just a half hour and I failed after 12 minutes).<br>  <br>  3. I can't help but feel that people are talking behind my back.<br>  <br>  4. I get a kick out of being uncooperative and watching people suffer.<br>  <br>  The other points you highlighted above like wanting to walk at night, cannot stick to rules and wake late etc etc are not the main things you should worry about in comparison to the ones numbered above.<br>  If you really feel you want a professional answer to your question above on mental sanity, you need to seek a certified psychiatrist or maybe a doctor to begin with if you prefer a referral.|`|Sob4zaUSaa	I do that stuff....I guess I thought it was normal til I read this:/|`|SeNz1cyFaa	there are a lot of people like that dont worry :P|`|aL0dgQgKaa	you lost it|`|AA11705909	It does look like you are having some sort of mental disturbance, you should see your medical practioner who will assess you.

Look after your well being.|`|v811KD7raa	sounds like an assessment by a shrink might be a good idea.  some of those things sound like symptoms of depression / OCD / low self esteem, or maybe none of those things, or maybe something else, or maybe something from your past is bugging you and needs resolving|`|HmWSssa7aa	yeah|`|dhDuhtxAaa	I can emphasis with you my friend. Ive been in a similar situation in the past. Its a sign that you are stressed. You shouldnt worry. Its fairly common, especially in the west. You need to get to the route of the cause in order to find a solution. But the more negatively you think, the more negativity you will attract to yourself. The longer you feel stressed for means the more harm you are doing to your mind and body. <br>  <br>  I read a book called The Secret that completely changed my thinking. I started to attract a lot of good things back into my life! Its also worth talking to someone about this who understands. Feel free to PM me if you like.|`|taOCxBgqaa	I personally think you're just making your habits or whatever you wanna call them seem negative. But if I'm being honest a large majority of those things describe me! Others don't but all the same. You're possibly just going through a stage and are looking at thing differently or observing yourself more. See? <br>  <br>  If you start to get worried or it gets worse tell someone close to you or your Doctor or whatever. But I don't see any reason for that to happen.<br>  <br>  I'm unsure about some of the things actually. Just try to sit down and have a good old think about everything and maybe you'll realize why you feel/ are behaving differently. Something has triggered it possibly, but I'm unsure<br>  <br>  In short no, you're not going insane. Insane is a totally different level <br>  <br>  I'm no expert but thats is what I think. =]

hd2uNljsaa	I have a "barometer head." Every time the barometer changes suddenly, I get a migraine. It's not so bad during the day, because I have meds that work well if you take them at the very beginning of the migraine, but when the barometer changes overnight, I sleep through the first stages of the headache and wake up in agony. Not fun. So yes, it's very possible that your headaches are related to the weather. Hang in there. You're just a "natural woman" - in tune with nature.|`|ec76af399c519dad926a10430304f541aa	Almost any illness can raise blood pressure and cause migraine.|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Its the cold . Keep your neck and head warm, and put hot packs on your shoulders to relax those tense muscles.|`|dFereHE6aa	Yes, because the cold makes your skin retract and the blood vessels become to big for your temples and that causes a migraine.|`|v5YBydCGaa	i think so b/c i have one right now along with ear pain.
58e49cee94da926929118606381c20f0aa	If the cold went away, i wouldn't worry about it.  Viruses will eventually run their course and go away on their own.  An antibiotic helps get rid of the virus (germ) before it gets any worse, like pneumonia.  Which is a lot worse.  Disaster avoided this time, but you should probably take the antibiotic next time.|`|sw2R5A9iaa	you have some trust issues with your doctor.  get a 2nd opinion.|`|C5AWotMRaa	If it was a virus, you do not need an antibiotic. Antibiotics are for bacteria. If the virus was able to run its course, then you are fine. <br>  <br>  As a side note, the over prescribing of antibiotics is the reason for a lot of the "super germs" that have been popping up all over the place. Over use of antibiotics and us being so super clean with antibacterial soaps, sprays, hand sanitizer, etc cause the germs to adapt to the surroundings and become resistant to treatments.|`|zjtxKpLqaa	You will be fine, it had to have been nothing serious. But when you start taking an antibiotic and stop partway through then the virus becomes immune to that antibiotic so the next time you get that illness the antidiotic won't work too well. if done too many times then you might become resistant to that antibiotic. but it sounds like you never started it and it probally just went away on its own|`|qXCgeye3aa	you will be fine...i dont go to docs unless life or death, everything else, your body will fight off...its bad when you start and dont finish anti-bio...b/c then your body becomes weaker, and cant fight next virus. if you didnt take it and you feel fine, thats good, your body strong,and and fighting off virus on its own...docs are waste of $$
6IiyIZQgaa	Do not take hot showers, that will take the moisture out of your skin. Buy a good body wash something that moisturizes your skin (I recommend Dove products).<br>  For your acne buy a lotion that isn't oily, I would suggest Aveno. Their products are not oily, just buy the daily use lotion. Also, vaseline works great for moisturizing skin. Don't use benzyol peroxide on your face for a while. Just use a cleanser that is made for sensitive skin or one that has lotion in it. <br>  Right after you get out of the shower, while your pores are still open, put on a good moisturizing lotion such as Curel.<br>  I hope this helps!|`|J4hOL3oLaa	Use the moisturizing cream Cetaphil. It works!! I am on Accutane for acne and that medication dries your skin, lips and eyes really bad. I use that cream twice a day and my skin looks great!
YsiT2t8Eaa	You can check the calorie value of many foods at:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.calorieking.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.calorieking.com/</a><br>  <br>  although, I do think you are a little low for a day.|`|nWjnuYDUaa	Eat more often. Six times a day and start the day out with a banana and a yogurt or you will starve by lunch. I nibble at work all day. I will bring in strawberries or raspberries and eat them with low fat organic vanilla yogurt.<br>  I can't sit and calculate your calories accurately, unless I saw what you ate. Snacking on healthy food all day helps. <br>  Do not eat until you are full, just untill you are not hungry anymore.|`|YJ3s8Alcaa	I dunno about calories but you're eating less than me and I'm already underweight (according to the BMI chart).
a454ee46524abf792eec0686abd82584aa	I agree it sounds like a migraine. You should rest in a darkened room after taking pain killers. Get checked out by a doctor to make sure that's what it is though.<br>  Geoff|`|4NiRJZkAaa	Sounds like a migraine headache. Stay in a dim room ,tack panadine forte, and see a doctor when better fo a checkup.|`|BwR67sFdaa	You need to stop jumping that's why
0ff94ba9320182f79127dc5f55cbcaefaa	I'm sorry that you're experiencing so much pain. Are they prescribing you anything at all? <br>  <br>  The reason I ask is that narcotics are often much less effective against neuropathic pain than other types of medication, which may be why your doctors are reluctant to prescribe them. Have they suggested other types of medications - for example tricyclic antidepressants or anticonvulsant? Both of these at low doses known to be effective against nerve pain - often much more so than even strong opiates. If you're not on such drugs, and haven't tried them, they'd certainly be worth raising with your doctors.<br>  <br>  Of course, the simplest answer if you are unhappy with your doctors is to raise your concerns with them. If they don't respond to your concerns - go elsewhere.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps, and really hope that you find something to help your pain.|`|t1NTGuIZaa	There has been such a huge rise in abuse of narcotic pain meds the past 5 years, they are probably being very careful with any prescriptions.  <br>  <br>  Many people fake pain to get a dr to get out his scribble pad, then either sell the drugs on the streets or use them for recreational drug use.  This is such a huge problem that we are now seeing PSA's on tv for it.  If you are in genuine pain, blame the fakers, not the doctors.|`|hvm1mywKaa	Im with you there. Im 15 and have chronic back pain for as long as you have and my docs will not prescribe any kind of pain killer after seeing the same doc for a year and a half. I have a hernia in my l5 and degenerative disk disease and some soft tissue damage so i no exactlyy how you feel. Iv recently had to drop out of school because of the pain. I would switch doctors.|`|hXMEDdTWaa	I agree with Kelli I  would deff see a different  doctor you should not have to  go through life being so miserable, but you can also thank all the idiots that go around doctor shopping for  pain pills for your  doctors to  not want to prescribe anything.|`|WCxzJMnvaa	I would find a new set of -respectful- doctors ASAP.<br>  <br>  Some doctors are so insensitive to claims of pain because some people abuse or sell the meds. But when there's clear reasoning as to what's causing the pain, you should, obviously, be treated for it.
DtvBLOzkaa	if you do weight lifting and you wanna do p90x in addition, you might want to do p90x lean.<br>  it will get you into shape and i trust it wont put too much stress on you muscles.<br>  also, you should look at synchronizing your regular workout and p90x, so you don't overdo certain parts of the body|`|X2Y6mKipaa	My guess is that it is perfectly safe to do both, just remember to eat more than you're eating now!<br>  <br>  You'll need more energy, so eat more!
CcTVp28Paa	It sounds like a pimple, I get them around my lips all the time and I know how embarrassing it is.  DO NOT pop it! It will make it worse.   Try putting acne creme on it, and a hot wash cloth to soothe it.  Also, ice will help reduce redness and swelling.|`|fArZmP7Gaa	not to be offensive but maybe you might be a bit paranoid.it can be anything so at the same time you can be right...if it doesnt start going away in like a week or so i would go see a doctor to be safe.|`|khP0HaQNaa	i also think your being a bit paranoid its probably just a coldsore. go get a cream or something but it will go away by it something nothing to worry about everyone gets them

Drink 1 ounce of water per pound that you weigh per day. i.e. 200 pounds = 200 ounces.|`|gviIjR4Raa	It is a possibility to lose weight rapidly but you should be realistic and accept that if you lose weight rapidly then you will without doubt put it all back on again just as rapidly. The only method which really delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials in stock, it was reported in Fox News and USA Today. I lost 30 pounds, it really does produce results!|`|lW3ZddDFaa	i think 6 cubs is the answer
niZBsn9Qaa	i bounce from the elliptical to the treadmill then back to the elliptical, total of 90 minutes of cardio. Change up  the speed and incline of the treadmill during your workout. <br>  <br>  HIIT training is good too. Google it and follow what it says. Its awesome for breaking plateaus.<br>  <br>  congrats on the 45 :) and good luck
UrZ8SFpqaa	Yikes! It sounds like it could be...you should really see your doctor right away when you get injured like that and go especially when you think that you're hurt.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Yes it could be broken, and yes, you should see a doctor.|`|c9Cz7cayaa	Honey, go get it checked out.  Then you can have peace.|`|O4KBKZEkaa	a break and a fracture are the same thing. An x-Ray is definitely needed

LuIFkPfwaa	The question is what is causing the over bite?  Is it just misalignment?  (misalignment + thumb sucking??) In which case removing her wisdom teeth (because her jaw is too small not just because) and braces would probably do it.  However, if it's because her lower jaw is smaller than the upper surgery is probably the way to go.  <br>  <br>  To be sure you should get at least one more opinion...and since extraction and possible surger  are involved an oral surgeon might be the one to ask.
0JyjOPxiaa	Oh my gosh girl!!! same here! my boyfriend throws FOOD down girls shirts! isnt that disgusting?? it makes me so mad, they do it to show off and to get boys to like them and really theyll never have a true relationship if thats all the girls care about
ycr6iVRraa	I wouldn't recommend trying to leave on your own accord. They will consider you AWOL (Absent Without Leave) and if your not already on an involuntary order, they will place you on one. Also they are likely to make you stay longer because they will consider this 'risky' or 'impulsive' behaviour.<br>  <br>  Do you have contact and support from your parents? Because this will make a difference on how well you can communicate your circumstances with your doctors. <br>  <br>  I'm assuming the reason they are keeping you in hospital is because your young. Its harder to diagnose someone who is still a teenager. So because of this they may not have decided they right treatment plan for you. Also if this is an act of impulse they may need to understand why you tried to kill yourself so you don't hurt yourself in the future. I does sound like you have been suffering from serious depression and my heart goes out to you.<br>  <br>  Those places aren't very nice and I can understand how you would feel like its making you worse. I hope you find the right treatment for when you leave.<br>  Good luck<br>  x|`|t2R3mEMoaa	I believe you will be staying for awhile. If you don't know why you did this then an answer has to be found first or you may attempt it again. You said you had no thoughts of killing yourself and yet you tried and this may happen again. For your own sake stay, and find this out for yourself. Life will get better. I am curious however to why you are allowed a computer on this ward.|`|upvLAyyzaa	36 anti-depressants???  You are lucky to be alive, for real.  I'm not very familiar with laws concerning minors and suicide.  I know generally, they will hold you for 72 hours pending a psych evaluation.  But since you're 15, you may need a parent or guardian to sign you out.  If the doctor is saying you can't leave, you can't leave.  That shouldn't be your biggest concern anyhow.  You should be getting the help you need first so this does not happen twice.|`|Z19gRYZwaa	Your parents might be able to get you out, but in general you are not likely going to get a say in this having attempted suicide only a few days ago. As I understand it, the idea is that if you attempted suicide then any attempt to get out of treatment is another attempt to get yourself killed, not an informed, logical decision.|`|FszxeECvaa	oh my gosh... I wouldn't|`|fskCvWWiaa	Girl you need HELP.  Have you actually talked to someone about why you did it.  Were the pills yours?  If so what for?  You need to see a counsellor and just talk.  Talking to friend and family (if you can)  aren't enough.  A professional is objective they won't take sides and will help greatly.  Try to stay calm and ask the doctor why you have to stay.  ASK TO SEE A COUNSELLOR.  Good luck.  You are very young and have your whole life ahead of you.  DO NOT DESPAIR.  If your down the only place to go is up.  I hope I have helped.  Take care and be well.  Good luck.  From  Suzanne|`|QDniizqsaa	Every one has a time of an emotional break down at some point in you're life. You just have to remember that you are a human too and if you feel emotional hurt in any way tell someone that you've known forever. A loved sister, loving parents or youre REAL best friend.  <br>  <br>  <br>  P.S. This is pointless if you tell someone you don't care about ( a recent boyfriend of a week or even a month) wish you a happy recovery.|`|CkdSTD1Baa	You're 15, so you're parents still have rights over you. I'm not sure what THEIR rights are in this situation, but no matter what, you cannot leave without their consent. But I believe that you will be arrested if you leave, and brought back. <br>  <br>  But you need to stay. If the doctor thinks you need to stay, you do. Just push through it. <br>  <br>  Get better hon!|`|h7uxxiZZaa	you have to be in the hospital till the doctors say you can go. you as a minor have no real rights to walk out. i was in the hospital for 3 days after over dosing on 80  ritalin. I had no rights. I had to stay in there for the time the doctor said. i was also 15. if you walk out like i did at 23 you will be arrested and at 15 you will also be arrested since you are a threat to yourself and maybe to others. so be strong and pretesapate in all the meetings and groups that they have and that will show the doctor you are ready for going home. being in there can be down right depressing and lonely.I have been in the hospital four times and i am 23. I wish you the best of luck.
s7hEvXQdaa	I suggest going to your school guidance counselor or principal.  Ask for help in broaching this subject with your mother.  Mental illness in any of its forms can be embarrassing:  to ones self, family and colleagues.  Maybe using a professional source when you approach your mother for help will ease the pain for her and help her resist the "not my child" syndrome which so many parents suffer from.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	I think you should consider asking the following question:<br>  <br>  My mom is depressed. She is so depressed she doesn't give her kids enough attention or takes them seriously. There is something to be said about some cynicism dealing with teenage kids, though when it gets to be too much, it's more a sign the lack of honesty is with the mom herself.<br>  How can I break through my mother's state of denial and lack of genuine attention towards me? Why do I resort to emo tactics to get some attention when a simple serious talk should be able to get some genuine reply?|`|1NPVVxW0aa	Please tell your older sister that she's right if you can't tell your mom.<br>  <br>  You really need some help and they will both want to give it.<br>  <br>  It's hard for some people to accept these things sometimes in a family and sometimes easy to dismiss as something else and try to ignore it, even when it's obvious to other people. <br>  <br>  I hope you get to deal with what's really bothering you and your mom understands. If not I hope you tell an adult in authority, maybe a teacher?|`|76845aa2d3f727081f73b3db267a28b8aa	Tell Mom you need to see a doctor soon as possible,explain everything to your doctor and then you and your doctor can break it to Mom about the cutting and your doctor will try you on medicine that can help you.|`|IDZofGJgaa	keep a diary hope ur mom finds out n when ur not home she'l read it n find out!|`|TrcMc8nVaa	sent you an email
WSziasfMaa	I would be imaginary because when you least expect me, I'd be there!! mwa hahahaha!|`|YupMCYHlaa	I wouldn't want to be an irrational number (though people certainly have accused me of being irrational!) because rational numbers are mysterious!  Nobody could really know me completely.  Nobody could ever quite reach me, only approach me closely enough for whatever purpose.  I think that would be frustrating.<br>  <br>  And I certainly wouldn't want to be an imaginary number because I would always be rotated 90 degrees.  Well, actually, that's not too bad, I am usually rotated 90 degrees on the couch.<br>  <br>  I'd really like to be a whole number.  A nice round number.  Not an odd number.   Maybe a prime, that would be nice.  Not too big, just moderate size.
L9XS5Gqgaa	Well, it's called "pure O." It's the "O" part of OCD.(obsessive/compulsive disorder)  The O part is obsessive *thought* and the *acting* part, like checking and rechecking, washing etc. is the compulsion part. People can have just the O part. That they cause you distress is part of the diagnosis<br>   Usually they thoughts are irrational like "what if that bump in the road was a person and I killed someone?"  What if because I think that child is cute it really means something else?"  "What if I stepped on that bandaid  with my shoes on and now I have a contagious disease?"<br>  The danger is that you will not enjoy life and will think you are nuts, and be afraid to seek treatment because you will be afraid that the person treating you will think you're nuts or bad for thinking these things.  (you're not and they won't if they are a certified counselor) The other danger is that it could affect your relationships and work.  The only physical danger that I can think of is the effects of stress day in and day out, (poor sleep, more suseptible to illness etc.)<br>  The treatment is a combination of medication and talk therapy. <br>  <br>  Or if it's generalized but rational, like, "what if I screw up at work today" or "I don''t think I'll ever find a marriage partner"  It could be Generalize Anxiety Disorder.  There are medications and talk therapy for that too<br>  The treatments work well for both.|`|XFZmAMOAaa	Not a problem because you recognize it for what it is.Your first sentence was the clue.When we stay in side for days no matter how busy,we're not getting enough stimulation.Think of a picture on the wall in your home,you see it but you don't look at it.It's like the same old things around us but we just don't pay attention to it.Same with staying in all the time.We need new stimulation or the mind goes stale.Thats all thats happening with you.With out new stimulation,our minds will try to invent new things.Get out and do something once in a while or you'll get cabin fever.|`|40zewEkMaa	Yeah, if you drink enough alcohol, then it will put you to sleep and you won't have a chance to think.  So if you stay drunk, you shouldn't have a lot of irrational thoughts.<br>  <br>  But on a serious note, I'd talk with your doctor.  We defintely aren't physicians.|`|IKw5lXQbaa	i have the same problem.before i joined the army it almost paralyzed me, kept me doing anything. your problems will go away when you find something to take up your time, a reason for being. all your worrying is caused by an excess of energy. find something to get you out of the house and working of all that excess energy off.|`|tkkqqCHNaa	You might have sum sort of anxiety. i dont believe there is anysort of medication for it, unless you are going completely insane.I dont think it is dangerous, only to the degree were it may cause stress. if you are reaally worried about this, you should consult a psychiatrist,in hopes that he/ she can help.:)|`|pgn2eSpwaa	sounds like OCD<br>  <br>   meds help but a behaviorist is also a good idea|`|pYvkB0Heaa	Thinking things are good but yet if you feel uncomfortable because of it's rapid clutterness then you should calm down and relax.  Learn to control it.  Smoke weed or just watch soaps or something.  That will help distract you and since soaps have stupid stories and dumb characters then you wont sit there thinking of new ways to improve something or wonder how does he fly or how with just a swing of the finger he can slice through flesh and bone without even touching the person.  <br>  <br>  But then if you go see one of those crazy psych doctors then they will put you on some stupid drug/s that will only make you worst so just work hard on trying to relax and to control it on your own.  Plus...get out and do something.  Being stuck at home is very unhealthy for your body, soul and head.  Live life.<br>  <br>  Or go to a doctor who specializes in medical marijuana recommendations.  If he/she thinks that you are a good candidate then I've learned that you should smoke a heavy indica such as:<br>  <br>  *  Grand Daddy Purple<br>  *  Purple Urkle<br>  *  Mendo Purps<br>  *  Sour Diesel<br>  *  God's Gift<br>  <br>  These are all medical marijuana strains that I just learned are heavy hitters to relax the brain.  Not the heaviest like the kush strains which are only recommended for the seasoned medical user.  <br>  <br>  I have a friend who's son was told to take certain psych drugs that only made him worst and into a heavy state of depression.  He has everything going for him and yet he now wants to die.  All part of the side effects.  Just see a doctor and if you are not happy with what they give you then read up on medical marijuana from all sorts of websites and materials and make a choice from there.  Good luck.

Make sure your clitoris and your fingers are well lubricated, then rub in slow, sexy circles. Vary your speed and pressure (not too hard) until you find something that would drive yourself wild. You should also make sure that your hands and fingers are clean.

And yes there are health effects too.<br>  Your body's metabolism slows down in an effort to conserve energy when you skip meals. We all have an internal mechanism that senses when our body is deprived of nutrition and when this happens it holds on to as many calories as it can in an an attempt to fend off starvation. It is best to have your 3 main meals as light meals and then include a mid morning and mid afternoon snack to hold you over. This gives you a good balance in calorie intake.|`|AA11865529	You lose loads of weight until your metabolism shuts down.

1vaqtRI2aa	Try cardio (take a walk around the neighborhood, walk your dog, go on a treadmill) for about half an hour for 2-3 days a week. Spot targeting doesn't usually work- you'll lose weight all around, unfortunatly.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to those crash diets, cleansings, detoxing, fasting and tea fads. Those don't work, and if they do, they're just a quick fix. <br>  <br>  I'll copy what I wrote down in another question, you have the same situation it seems, and edit some of it.<br>  <br>  For weights and home exercises, try and do squats and lunges for the lower body, lifting weights for your arms, and bicycles for your abs. If you don't know what some of these are, I added links below to show you a video on how to do it.<br>  <br>  For your food, start cutting back on your intake and eat smaller portions. Six small meals a day are healthier than 3 big meals a day.<br>  <br>  Subbing bad foods for a healthy alternative is great too. Instead of regular ice cream, try Edys Slow Churned Ice cream. Instead of regular sliced American cheese, try Land O Lakes Slenderized Cheese. Instead of eating chips with a meal, eat celery with hot sauce or hummus.<br>  <br>  Once you start making slight changes, you'll notice a HUGE difference! And consider getting a personal trainer or bringing a friend to the gym. They are so motivational and help you stick to it. Pick out some pictures and use those as a motivator for you and think "this is what I wanna look like!" to yourself.<br>  <br>  Good luck and feel free to e-mail me or i/m me.|`|3pg5ZujMaa	1) exercise to burn calories<br>  2) do strength training to build muscle<br>  3) drink caffeinated green or black tea<br>  4) eat smaller, more frequent meals<br>  5) do not skip breakfast<br>  6) eat low-fat dairy<br>  7) drink 8 cups of water a day (try not to drink any soda at all, even ice tea cuz they're sweet)<br>  8) fidget (cuz when u fidget u move which causes u to use energy in your body)|`|qskWsDnYaa	Hey I understand all the girls want to be skinny but your only 14 and judging from your height and weight you have nothing to worry about.

Only you can. I'm sure if you reach out to someone you know and tell them you're at your breaking point and make no bones about it, help will come. Ask a friend if you can study at their house. When your at school and at gym class, think positive. People will respond to your positive energy. Be an inspiration to them. When people see that you can overcome adversity, and you absolutely can, they will respect you. When they see that you won't stand for people being mean to you and bullying you, they will respect you. Respect will lead to new friendships. And they will be of the truest kind. Friendships based on looks or social status don't last and they are not healthy. The friendships you have potential to develop will last a lifetime and they will be a positive influence on everyone. Please, never ever give up hope. The spring of hope flows eternally.|`|nPtbld6laa	Taking your life is never the answer.<br>  Just think of how your family would react, it would break their hearts.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you can't study at home, go to the local library, or even just a local park.<br>  <br>  <br>  Also, just remember that it won't always be like that, for example, many hollywood actors have had poor childhoods and look what they have done with their lives.

When I was in high school, I felt the same way. Now I'm in college, and those things don't even matter anymore. Pimples are so temporary--you can go on prescription meds for them and they'll disappear. Social anxiety can be handled simply by making yourself go out and interact more with poeple. You are not ugly. Everyone, even models, feel ugly from time to time but I want you to go look at yourself in the mirror and say, "I am beautiful. I love myself." Say it over and over until you believe it. If you don't find yourself beautiful first, how can you expect someone else to find you beautiful. Believe in yourself, and don't do anything drastic.

Not many people liked going to high school. I didn't. People used to make fun of me too--not so much during high school, but I definitely was not popular. I always considered the unpopular people in high school to be the more interesting ones; to me, the ones that hung out in cliques seemed all the same, boring types of people. High school will be over in less than four years (which may seem like a long time, but trust me--it really is not), and then you can go to college where it will be much better. <br>  <br>  Everyone talks about everyone else; you just have to learn to deal with it. Who cares what they say anyway? It always makes me wonder that some people can have such boring lives that they derive enjoyment out of talking **** about other people--you should feel sorry for them that their lives are so meaningless.<br>  <br>  Why have you lost interest in writing and drawing? I love writing myself and wish I could spend more time on it. I used to draw too, but that also got cut out because of work and school unfortunately. I always admired artist-type people. Don't give up on those interests! Try to get it back.  <br>  <br>  Have you tried benzoyl peroxide for breaking out? My skin used to be pretty oily, but that cleared it right up (Get the gel-based kind as it works better); you can also try a product containing alpha-hydroxy--it's suppose to work to prevent acne too. If those don't work, try salicylic acid, that's suppose to help too. Acne's a tough nut to crack--it generally takes a few tries because it seems like different things work for different people. <br>  <br>  But really don't give up. And you're not stupid either; many people hit low points in their life when they feel like there is no hope. You're not stupid for feeling that way (I sure know I have felt that way many times in my life). The important thing is to not cave in and just decide to end it all.

I found out one thing through all that and that's not all Psychiatrist and therapist are equal, and sometimes it takes a while to find the right one for you. However, sometimes you do have to give them a chance, too. So, you can't pass judgment right away.<br>  <br>  Generally speaking, Psychiatrist basically handle your medication management - it's why they usually don't spend too much time with you after your diagnoses. Most of the real work is done by you with the help of your therapist.<br>  <br>  Anyway, as I was saying I saw a Psychiatrist and a therapist several years ago and I thought I was better, so I stopped seeing them. Unfortunately, I was wrong and and I didn't find out until I fell into a very deep depression and did try to kill myself around 3 + years ago now.<br>  <br>  As a result, I ended up in the hospital, then when I got discharged I self-admitted into a behavioral hospital, where I was a resident for about a week. After that I self-admitted into their day program, where I attended classes from 9AM to 4PM M-F for almost 6 months. During that time I was still under the care of my new Psychiatrist and before I left the program I got setup with a private therapist associated with my Psychiatrist office. I am still on the same medication as I was 3 years ago, but I'm no longer suicidal like I was back then. I still suffer from depression and my other issues, but it's not quite as intense all the time or for as long.<br>  <br>  If you are feeling suicidal and think you are going to act upon those feelings, then you need to get help imediately - even if it means going to the emergency room or calling 911. I don't know your age, but if you are real young you might want to let your parents know what's going on, because maybe they can help you.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|AA10701265	you've been alive this long dont let like that, theres a reason for you to be alive, if anyone wants to talk **** then stand up for yourslef dont let people push you around youll eather get  respect or people will learn to leave you the **** alone, the longer you run the worse it getts, **** everyone n thr **** talkin|`|NS3BxXEmaa	Killing your self is a free ticket to hell look re-think it because life can be so fun and best of all be your self and when someone makes fun of you just walk away a fight is not work <br>  but please re-think about killing your self it is a bad choice.<br>  hope to god u change your mind<br>  go to church <br>  pray|`|2DRWQxP3aa	omg. you sound like me.

YOU JUST LET THE PEOPLE WHO WANT TO DESTROY YOUR LIFE AND ALL THAT, JUST SIMPLY  WIN OVER YOU..? maybe like most girls would say, you need a make over..you need to forget what happens in the family, it's just something to disturb your life, i know i've been through this... umm...what i did one day, was forget what people thought and stuff, and changed myself inside from top to bottom, I'm talking to people, i get involved i try to be funny and i am =P (make lots of people laugh) and in gym class, if you don't like it, try and hang with the teachers they can be best friends almost do what i did...I've changed, why can't you?? it's simple, and really it's...like...so easy, you may think and say...oh, yea really easy...but if you go and try and let yourself beat your nerves you can do this, talk, be social...change how you look i guess..ignore how your family acts...just...look at me, im so much happier, i love how i live, and I've changed. in just one year, I've had many friends, and im 20x happier now...change...do it for yourself...|`|XL0cIxj1aa	schools have counselors, maybe trying try talking to one of them and they'll keep it private. I was in your situation back in 9th grade, but i pulled it around. maybe you can find a private school somewhere those are always better than public schools. I hated public school. i just enedd up going to a private school run by a bunch of hippies and they really helped me put a good slant on life. i've come to realize hat yes life sux sometimes, but it's our disposition and attitude towards it that makes it better. You really need to try to not let others get to you, its hard i know when you have to be around it every damn day bt for the sake of you and your family you shoudl really try hard to look past the small things and look at the bigger picture. as for studying see if you can join some study groups to help and you may even make some better friends there. sounds like the friends you currently have aren't very good ones. the group you hang with makes all the difference. i'm praying for you, do the right things and work on bettering yourself. :-) your not stupid your a good person you can do this.|`|sy4HR96eaa	I am stupid too. it's okay.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and, don't commit suicide kid..really...it destroys everything..|`|n336SjRiaa	school is stupid. and people in highschool are rude. very rude. but honey, you have to not let them get to you, it is hard I know. I suggest occupying yourself with something you enjoy, writing and drawing, like you said. get back into it. try to cleanse your mind of everything, and find a happy place ( i know that sounds cheesy as heck but it works) if you hate your acne, try drinking green tea and put virgin coconut oil on your face. or the ever so popular pro-active. If you believe there is no God, i think even just praying may help you feel better. I, myself believe there is a God, and I'm pretty damn sure he loves you with all his heart. so it comforts me and may comfort you in knowing there is a being that loves you. your family loves you. siblings suck sometimes, but i have learned that being nice to my siblings, results in them being nice back. thats how people work, they retaliate. you could try the same thing at school possibly. you aren't stupid to be this way. i wish I could help you more. also, try essential oils and aroma therapy, it surprising works. look it up and order some. i think some are in natural or organic stores.<br>  :) pura vida.|`|oDLdqrJfaa	Alright first of all...your family is a distraction for you....things will not change with them ( you can't change other people you can only change yourself). Get good grades....really try your hardest....and i swear to you if you have good grades....they don't have to be A's at first....work your way up.....then work on how you look.....and remember their are negatives to the female attraction.....which is looks based.....so look good....not model or amazing at first but build it. And the better you look the more guys will talk to you. remember me as a guy....i don't care about a girls confidence.....its irrelevant as long as she is nice and good looking.( although girls it is opposite they rarely care about a guys looks but how he acts more) Losing interests in activities you liked is a sign of depression....but is it really a big deal.......women are emotionally based unlike men which are logically based. Its not about fighting your depression.......don't fight it......but accept it.....welcome it and slowly become better and better.....grade wise and looking. And things will start to fall in to place. Remember they are emotions......they are feelings your body puts in you to help you.....they are not reality and they are not God. Lastly their is no God it is a political tool, its a big fraud, just because other people believe it will make you believe it because it is socially accepted. Their is no God but their is power in the Universe be spiritual not religious. Remember their are compassionate people.....we care about other people.....and not alot of other people like highschool.....i personally love highschool.....it fun for me.....but i know a lot of people who hate it..........killing yourself won't solve the problem....because you destroyed yourself.......work on grades and your looks................ i wish i could tell you all the **** i know about evolutionary psychology and why you feel the way you do but......i i can't. Their was this really pretty girl who killed her self ( im a senior) i had known her since 7th grade....its not the road to go......forget your family.....be more independent.....you should work to slowly build yourself into who you want to be. And advice about getting guys....you attract them with your looks....and if you want them to stick around make them invest in you before you give in.....make them spend time, effort, more importantly money, social currency whatever it is. Lastly .....if you let people's judgment effect you they are dictating your reality.......meaning you are being effected to much. have you ever judged someone??? maybe they were ugly.....but did you really care that they were ugly??.....no but they did...even though they should not have.Be cool with their judgments.....and if you make it out of high school.....which for most people is the worst years of their life....you will realize it was such a big hype....because the emotions made it feel real....even though it was not. Life is not a big deal.....but build a life. Everyone is programmed with the same emotions.....sadness, attraction, repulsion, jealous....|`|TMOILyUnaa	dont do it!|`|UHOGROhsaa	im with her<br>  you are stupid<br>  suck it up ur just fealing sory for yourself|`|wu2Xvt89aa	hey hey hey! wait your storie believe it or not is so like me hang in there it will get better i promise listen i have no mom and my dad raised me and my older brother by himself its very hard i know i have hardely any friends and i also have depressiion problems and want to die most times but i always think of my dad and my brother and the people that love me . it will all work out if you want you can email me at longhorngirl_92@yahoo.com i will help you! cause i also need help too!|`|5feebbaef078c57e8b297a04969b8f72aa	You first need confidence. If you think you are ugly then you can always change the way you look to improve yourself. If you break out then get acne cream or just good face wash and drink lots of water. Also if you can't study at home then go to the closet library or even the one in your school. I've experienced depression couple times throughout my life because of the pressure I get from my family but now I am doing okay because I realized I shouldn't care too much about anything. I find that if you care too much then you get more stress. Just take it easy and start drawing again. It takes up a lot of time and really helps in relieving strress.. Good luck|`|8Lmu2kXEaa	Your not stupid. You just have a lot of built up feelings that you dont want to let out. I feel the same way you do.

25VwK7pFaa	I'm with you -- supermarkets make healthy eating harder than it needs to be.  Here's a few ideas:<br>  <br>  1. Avoid anything with partially hydrogenated vegetable oil.<br>  2. Avoid anything with high fructose corn syrup.<br>  3. Eat a good breakfast<br>  4. Eat five times a day.<br>  <br>  By following steps 1 and 2, you automatically eliminate a lot of processed food in your diet. I just found it easier to remember 2 ingredients when I was at the grocery store than a whole list of processed food. <br>  <br>  Here's a healthy eating list with lots of specific fruits, veggies and foods that you can bring with you to the grocery store:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.healthy-diet-mom.com/healthy-food-list.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthy-diet-mom.com/healthy-...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  In Step 3, eating breakfast means eating protein and hopefully some fiber. If you don't like or have time for oatmeal or cereal and milk, try peanut butter on a banana, or cheese melted on toast in the toaster oven. You can even make scrambled eggs in the microwave in 2 minutes and wrap them in a tortilla with salsa. <br>  <br>  It also felt better to limit sugar intake, I watch sugar in products -- especially breakfast cereal. Try eating cereal with 6 grams of sugar or less such as Quaker Life—Regular Flavor, Multi Grain Cheerios, Cheerios –Regular Flavor, Kix, Crispix, Chex – Wheat, Rice, and Corn, Honey Bunches of Oats—regular flavor) <br>  <br>  Since you need to eat 5 times a day, here's some healthy snack ideas:<br>  <a href="http://www.healthy-diet-mom.com/healthy-snack-ideas.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.healthy-diet-mom.com/healthy-...</a><br>  <br>  I think you are great for trying to eat healthier!

LJkPRqN0aa	its bad if you get in a habit of doing that, you body needs a variety of foods that provide different nutrience for it veggies are important as well as anything else you could eat. what you are eating is somewhat healthy but truly has NO neutrience. im sure the jelly has a ton of sugar, peanut butter has oils in it, and bread has carbs and sodium which put together has very slim neutrience. try to pick a better way of eating and DIFFERENT variety..<br>  <br>  edit: geeze i was just trying to be helpful you dont have to criticize and be immature about my answer....|`|tIldpr7vaa	for 1 or 2 days not unhealthy , might get boring though|`|DDiNhGalaa	for 1 or 2 days this should be ok, but its much healthier to eat a variety of foods to obtain optimum nutrition. This diet should include more vegetables and more complete protein sources, but it is for a short period.
lTeXIjpOaa	you could lose weight from playing racquetball, it is a great cardio workout|`|8fu2UYnGaa	The pattern for losing weight is easy - eat less food and exercise more - the difficulties arise when we in reality try to put that into practice! There are a lot of stumbling blocks in the real world don't you think?! The sole thing which definitely showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box underneath, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been featured in Fox News and CNN. I shed twenty pounds, it definitely does produce success!

If you are in pain or your urethra is still hurting when you pee, you might want to wait until it stops hurting to have sex.<br>  <br>  best wishes..|`|4hNRTWtDaa	You're unlikely to pass it on.  However, the antibiotics you're on can reduce the effectiveness of birth control, which you are using, right?  ;)  If you MUST have sex, use a backup method.  I'd wait til your symptoms are gone, at least.  Really, it's safer to wait until you have your period next.<br>  <br>  Make sure you keep clean down there every time you have sex, and pee right after too.  That can help to prevent them.|`|AA11492002	Four days after you start your antibiotics.

It might burn a lot during sex if you do.|`|AA11820571	Do not have sex, make sure he gets checked, you don't want to pass it back and forth.|`|RCfc9hMKaa	You won't pass it on, it's not a contagious thing. It's an infection due to bacteria in your urinary tract. If you really want to have sex while you have a UTI, then ok...

fZ3FXZMyaa	I don't know how old the both of you are, I guess in high school.  I do know this, he was in his way letting you know he has an intrest in you.  The just looking at you for a second could mean he is not that out going and could very well mean he is just shy.  As for your so called friend, she has very low self-esteam.  My advice would be to wait and see if he approaches you not just eye-contact.|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	He was checking you out. If he's shy, you'll probably have to be a little more forward in letting him know you like him back. Girls have no idea how hard it is for a shy guy to tell a girl he likes her. If they did, they wouldn't play hard-to-get as much as they do.|`|f7bcycfgaa	what do you think he was he was doing?<br>  how does that make you feel????<br>  XD|`|lbmFP6ayaa	He was so checking you out woo hoo...|`|v3EZKBPQaa	WHENEVER a guy looks at you and turns away when you look up, hes interested, believe me.

l42UDjFGaa	I trust my body. When it's craving certain fruits, vegetables, milk...especially the good stuff, I feed the craving because I believe there's a reason I'm having the craving in the first place. I don't think it necessarily means you're deficient per se, in the sense of a long-term deficiency, but I would keep an eye on it. Woman are more likely to have Ca deficiencies that eventually lead to bone loss and osteoporosis. Some vitamin supplementation can't hurt, if you're really worried, but don't overdo it because that's no good either. Maybe a general multivitamin is the way to go.|`|usgKQuS1aa	watch drinking milk,  it cause excess mucous, and people shouldn't be drinking milk from an animal.   cows milk is for cows.|`|1JiRrZaNaa	ok the ladie who said watch drinking milk is nuts milk is good for u so drink alot milk kept me from braking my arm and my leg so|`|4onT0qUxaa	It's possible, but it is more likely that you just like milk!|`|LKIhUMCgaa	it's possible. just as in pregnancy, ur body generally craves for certain foods because ur body needs something from it, like calcium from milk. although, don't drink TOO much of it bc a lot of calcium has been known to cause kidney stones.|`|GZRTLEuiaa	no lol i always get craving for things then u have alot of it and get tired of it.
em2RDb6Laa	So sorry to hear about your anxiety.  Klonopin is a drug that, in my mind, has mixed reviews.  Firstly, it's fairly strong.  If you haven't taken any benzodiazepines before (the family that Klonopin is in - plus Ativan, Xanax, or any generic drug with -azepam at the end), you could very well react the way you did.  Another reason I don't care for it much is that it is extremely habit-forming.<br>  <br>  The newer anti-depressants are excellent for anxiety.  Any SSRI can help greatly with anxiety without the side effects of the benzodiazepines.<br>  <br>  On a side note, a lot of people do like Klonopin...but that's probably because they like the high feeling.  I see it all the time, and quite a few of them end up in detox because they begin to abuse it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Try an SSRI if the Klonopin continues to make you feel lousy.|`|cp7fjeJhaa	i didnt like klonopin either, ask your dr for ativan it is much, much better start with .5mg, great stuff|`|upvLAyyzaa	Well the dizziness and nausea are side effects from the medication, everyone is going to react to it differently.  I also take Klonopin, lowest dose, and I found that it really helped me with my panic attacks....I don't really have them anymore.  The only side effect that I noticed when I first began taking it was lack of concentration, so I tried to avoid taking it at work.  But overall, I believe it's a good medication for me.    <br>  <br>  So if it wasn't a good experience for you, go to your doctor and tell her you would like to try something else.|`|4fC6EJWfaa	Yeah, I heard of that. Klonopin is very strong even in low doses...I refused to take it when I was prescribed it. Try Ativan, it's much better. I've taken ativan before and my fiance takes it as needed for anxiety.|`|MpVQE8tnaa	I don't get high on it.<br>  <br>  I take (2)  1/2 mg pills = 1mg.  I use it for sleep--and under monthly psychiatric care<br>  <br>  Can make you drowsy....I take it at night.  Try that.

AA10481463	I have never read how it happens, but I would guess it would be heavy sleep deprivation. You would be so deep into a sleep that you wake up and try to walk and talk but you are still under the effects of sleep. Most of us can wake up enough to know that we are walking to the bathroom and we are awake enough to aim and do what we need to do. And we are awake enough that we do not bang into a wall or a person. So i do not really understand the concept of sleepwalking that a person can not be gently controlled to go back into bed.

The brain compensates for survival of the psyche.<br>  <br>  It's always right to love. It's always right to grieve those we love.  Period.  You are a beautiful soul. Bless you.|`|eAupvb3taa	I think there are 2 kinds of care givers. One that puts in the 8 hours, does the job and leaves it at work. And the other that bonds with patients and their families. There is nothing wrong with grieving for someone who dies. Cry, scream, go to the gym, do whatever you need to do to feel better. The hurt will get better as time goes by. Some people in your profession are hardened to death. They deal with things their own way. I say be sad all you want. You obviously cared for her. You would grieve  for a niece wouldn't you? I think "Sara" would be smiling from above knowing how much you did indeed love her unconditionally. :-)|`|ejbSFv0caa	Sadly the 'caring services' are overflowing with hard hearted people who are wholly unsuited to the job but too stuck in their ways to change.  So I should imagine quite a few of your colleagues don't really care and therefore do not grieve when a service user dies.<br>  <br>  That you care enough to greive is a good thing!  However, the longer you are in the job the more detached you will become so the effect a loss has on you will reduce as the years go by.<br>  <br>  Some of your colleagues will be in that state.. they will greive but it will be tempered by the knowledge that perhaps the person is out of her misery or no longer suffering.<br>  <br>  Grief is a strange emotion.  It is so wrapped up with the previous experiences of the individual.  Just last week I was reading a Q on here and the impact it had on me was profound.  I sobbed for several minutes.  It had triggered memories that I had not had for years.  I can think about those memories right now and they ave no impact on me, yet maybe tomorrow I will watch a film or hear bad news or see a face that resembles a loved one now gone,... and again I may be sobbing.<br>  <br>  Professionalism is fine but we live in a real world and sometimes our tears are indeed an honest expression of pains we want to control but don't yet have control of.  <br>  <br>  Talk to other people about this, but probably not your colleagues as knowledge is power and from personal experience I would warn against trusting people too much who seem not to care.  They can be VERY cliquish and see you ads an outsider simply because you relate better with the people you look after.  It is possible if not preferable,  to look after people with real love and affection, it just hurts more!<br>  <br>  Oh & don't forget - you helped her live a more comfortable, happier & LOVED life!  So it is OK to grieve & still do your job well for the sake of the others you care for.|`|1jdRPGMyaa	WoW making me get emotional.<br>  I feel bad for what you have to go through.<br>  I would try to be strong, dont cry unless you think that helps you.<br>  I personally think that grieving is a sign of weakness, but do what you do, i think that women might need to talk with someone about it. maybe a psychologist or family member.|`|jlbMKE1vaa	i feel for you because in that profession you are expected to be able to 'deal' with it. you just need to find your own way to grieve. :)|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	u were obviously closer with her than anyone else. <br>  talk with her family and share ur feelings. thats the best thing to do is let it out.|`|Dug6yDOLaa	when i was 13 my friend was murdered by her father during the summer. then her father killed himself. her brother found her and her father both shot with a shot gun. the father definitely did it. i was so sad, i cried for days. i had no clue how to deal with it. i didn't want to talk about it because i was scared. this is what i did:<br>  1. i wrote out what i was feeling, it really helps, you can tell a journal and know that it won't tell anyone else<br>  2. i drew pictures, sad or happy, just to get my feelings out<br>  3. i slept a lot, it wasn't really good, get a lot of sun<br>  4. go out with friends to keep your mind off things

khdFNlJ7aa	well, I read about this because the same thing happens to me all the time. It happened like 3 times last night. Over and over again until I just woke up and turned on the TV... I heard that this is a common thing with people and sleeping, although I have had this happen and there was a shadow figure standing above me staring at me and I could not move, and when I tried to yell for help I could only wimper lightly. This is horrifying, it happens to me all the time. This is something that is normal though for people, wether or not it is a demon, maybe it is just a nightmare. I don't know, but i get scared too when this happens and once it happens one time, right when I try to go to sleep it will always happen again, until I am afraid to sleep and just sit up and watch tv until I feel ready to sleep again.<br>  <br>  Add Details- Actually the proper term for this is sleep paralysis, and this is NOT scitzoprhenia.... look it up they have it here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paralysis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_paral...</a>|`|oQ4dU8qvaa	My best guess is that it has something to do with the fact that when you dream you are supposed to be paralysed.

velIdcbNaa	Although your teacher holds the right to say no, they cannot deny you the right to go to the bathroom.  If you really have to go then get up and walk out the door.  Your teacher will have a problem with this and you will get sent down to the office, but calmly explain, that when they themselves have to go to the bathroom they get another teacher to watch the Class and they go.  So what makes your bathroom needs any different?  I exercise this when needed.  Not all the time though.  If I really have to go, and they won't let me then I get up and go.  They cannot stop you. that is denying you the basic human needs and they cannot do that.  My dad is very law smart and has explained a lot of things like this to me especially since we do have that time when we do need to leave!<br>  Being a freshmen has nothing to do with it unless all of the teachers do it. if its just your teacher then you may have the problem I had.  The teacher simply didn't like me because I know how to argue with adults and not seem rude. (it comes in handy with the life i live trust me so learn fast how to do it.  don't be rude when you do it though speak in a momotone voice if you do know how to do it) so one day she wouldn't let me go.  I asked her after my test and she said no with the fakest smile you ever saw.  So i smiled back and walked right out of the door.  of course she hated me even more because she tried to get me in trouble but my mom tore her a new one (so did the rest of my family).  It turns out she liked my attitude in the end and requested for me to be sent back into her class for the next class group.<br>  <br>  sorry for talking your ear off! and good luck!  if worse comes down to worse complain to the school board and have them look into it, they will because what she is doing is wrong.<br>  <br>  messaage me if you need help with this again I can tell you exactly what to say in a respectful manner.|`|451c455bd077166a1cd91fe42a1d17baaa	the teacher can't let every girl in the room out all the time ,,, so wear panty liner to school and change at lunch time|`|caExWxHbaa	tell the bastard that its a girl emergency|`|W05lqxGHaa	yeah pantyliners are the best for that|`|BWF8ol8Naa	Discharge is normal and you shouldnt have to be worried and going everytime you have a chance to the restroom.. .|`|pYvkB0Heaa	yes pantyliners and if you need to, ask and do say it's a girl thing.  they understand and let you go.  but don't abuse it so she/he wont think you are "crying wolf."|`|InslW3QMaa	tell the teacher its feminine and if they still say no then tell them fine you get to pick uop the mess <br>  <br>  (dont try this unless your desperate)|`|PFm1dI55aa	Maybe pantyliners?|`|w7XNcmihaa	Wear pads or pantyliners to soak it up.|`|wHdPzovBaa	panty liners|`|9EAW8PXkaa	Wear a lightday.Thats what i do.|`|RYf3sf6Daa	welcome to my world|`|PBkLaIpwaa	I would recommend wearingg pads or pantyliners.

At first, take part in minimal amounts because if you start out with lets say an hour of cardio, you won't last the whole way through. Start with about 20 minutes or so of it, or as much as you can handle 3x a week and work your way up. Once you start losing pounds from the cardio, you can start focusing on toning up specific body parts, and lifting weights.|`|CE1kBeSAaa	Hey<br>  <br>  Well the best way is to eat a healthy balanced diet. This means no snacking throughout the day. Try to have between 5 - 9 fruit or veg a day and 8 glasses of water. Try not to eat too much junk food etc. Oh and don't starve yourself, as that doesn't work. Trust me on that one! =D<br>  <br>  Do daily exercise to lose weight. I think situps are brilliant for losing weight. Do 10 mins of situps in the morning and then 10 mins in the afternoon. As you get used to this amount, increase the amount of time you spend doing them. However don't do too much as you may strain yourself. So becareful.<br>  Another good exercise is skipping. It uses vast amounts of energy - making it a good way to lose weight. <br>  <br>  Hope that helped. Good luck =]|`|MxIQkMUxaa	If you want to lose weight you need a healthy balance of grains, fruits and veggies. <br>  The best thing for you to do is to go to a dietitian/nutritionist.

Its hard to say what the reason is for belly fat because it can be a number of things. I would definitely say lay off the sweets. You want to incorporate a work out routine like Pilate's for example, that will stretch that area where you're saying you have "belly fat". I had the same problem, I started eating smaller portions, doing Pilate's, and leg lifts on the edge of a stable chair. It takes some time to get used to, but its worth it. I eat a lot of ruff age like spinach, romaine lettuce, i drink plenty of water no coffee, no soda, not a lot of juices.

m4YALsU9aa	Well I'm not sure what you're asking me, but I can help you with the last bit. It depends when you wake up. Waking up early in the morning is good for you, but you can choose not to. It is recommended that you sleep at least 8 hours, less if you're older (and by older, I mean 35+). However, the quantity of hours doesn't supposedly matters, it's the quality of your sleep.

When a woman is sexually excited, blood flow increases to the genitals so that the vulva and clitoris swell and the vagina lubricates itself, which is called "getting wet." Being "wet" reduces friction and makes penetration more comfortable.<br>  <br>  There's also another kind of "wetness" that girls and women experience — vaginal discharge, which is also called leukorrhea. Normal discharges are either thick and whitish or slippery and clear, depending on where a woman is in her menstrual cycle. Vaginal discharge is perfectly normal and healthy — it's the vagina's way of naturally cleaning itself.<br>  "|`|xTNxWlH7aa	well she might have had her period or she cold be wet whihc is sexualy aroused horny and it cuases the vigina to get moist and wet the inside like where you pee and might leek|`|Ir9jGOo2aa	It could of been some type of discharge, or maybe she was sweating in that area.

JkkWt0KYaa	Ok, first I hate those other people who post those spam answers promoting some weight lose thing. Haha alright so I am the same height and about the same weight, and my doctors have told me that 120 pounds is in the healthy range. However,  I myself am not happy with how I am, and want to loose about 10 pounds. Don't loose 30 pounds though to answer your question bluntly. Loosing 30 pounds would have you looking on the sickly skinny side.|`|CMyPGqSEaa	As long as you exercise and eat right your fine.

wkbdiQpWaa	Here's some awesome advice for you b/c I just figured this out myself from experience (lost 2" off my calves in the past month- not even kidding & SO happy about it!). If you're flexing your calves & no jiggle, chances are it's muscle...the same prob I had from wearing high heels for yrs upon yrs. My advice: cut back on exercises that mainly work that part of the leg AND wearing heels if you're doing that--go with flats. From what I've researched, things like that bulk up but shorten the muscle. What you want to do is more walking (I use an elliptical for about 30-60 mins a day) and some sort of exercise that stretches & lengthens the muscle like yoga or pilates.  Also, awesome website for balancing you calorie intake/activity: www.livestrong.com...The Daily Plate helps track all cals. & any possible activity you can think of. Good luck!|`|tIldpr7vaa	some people just have more muscular calves than others<br>  <br>  jumping rope alot wont give u big calves, ur prop just like that naturally, calf muscles can shake around a bit, doesnt mean its fat

qkblT2hgaa	The answer to you question has to do with the abdominal muscles being visibly defined when you look at your stomach. The "6 pack" describes the muscles like blocks or squares. Very fit people have 6 squares that are visible but 4 packs are also very common. Don't stress over having them. A good flat stomach is just as attractive and easier to maintain. People with 6 packs never enjoy the odd ice cream cone.
lDXh0jRVaa	Sounds like she is trying to control her cutting. Cutting is very different than suicidal because cutting is done to make you feel better- not to end it all. It's actually a way to AVOID suicide. I'm not saying that it's a good thing but there are worse things. Ask her if she wants help, ask her how bad things are and if she's getting better.If she has stopped cutting and is now just snapping the rubber band- applaud her! She's doing great and giving her the stress of being harassed by parents/counselors is going to make things a lot worse. If she is cutting still then you may want to talk to her parents. The best thing you can do is be a good friend and have an open ear. It sounds like she really just wants to open up to you.|`|leF0EHQxaa	my advice is try to find out why she feels she needs to hurt herself there is probably a much deeper reason that she is hurting herself when you find that out you can help her with whatever it is in fact she might even feel relieved that someone actually cares enough to find out what is wrong instead of just straight out telling her to stop i hope this helps|`|b80Zhg6Uaa	Talk to an adult you can trust about this so they can help your friend get the help she needs... She may be mad at you at first, but this has to stop. She's hurting herself and after she overcomes this, I know she'll be glad you did|`|Wf83LhUMaa	The same thing happened to me with a friend of mine, talk to an adult. Then, as much as it may hurt u should stay far away from her and make new friends.|`|BtDGWKSNaa	intervene.<br>  tell her parents if you have to.<br>  this is not a dumb reason.  <br>  if you're really worried about her write a letter to her explaining why you are.  maybe then she can help you to understand why she is doing this to herself.|`|51ba97a2a52ae3eb23ef742450ca66a9aa	Ask her her problem first then try to think for just a lil bit but not too  much or your friend will be irritated what to saay. giving her an advice can do or distracting her. like, asking her to go shopping, sight seeing, jamming w/ ur other friends. in this way shell  kinda forget her problems and enjoy life instead.<br>  <br>  gud lluck! :)
8d3e94d9970184d91991339790b16ce6aa	Some people are just naturally thin. I'm like this too. I'm about 5"3, 16, and i weigh like 89-91lbs depending what time of day it is! The thing is, some people just CANNOT for the love of cheese ever gain weight. Well they can...but it doesn't happen all at once or when we want it to or in the places we want it to....it happens gradually and usually we don't even notice a difference. See, when i try to up my caloric intake(which is what you're meant to do if you want to gain weight) all the weight just goes to my stomach; and yet my arms and legs and face are still toothpick thin. We can never win! It's like fighting a losing battle, right?<br>  The thing is just try to stay healthy and hopefully in time as you get older you shall fill out; i'm hoping that's what will happen for me. Don't listen to people saying that you're too skinny, chances are they're overweight and jealous! You are your own person, you can't be what they want you to be and you shouldn't have to conform to what society wants just to stay 'cool' or be treated with respect. You should be treated with respect whether you're fat, thin, tall, small, yellow, orange...haha you catch my drift!<br>  <br>  if you're really worried, why not see a doctor? it's always good to have a professional point of view.|`|Aq77sFxYaa	well ur just naturally thatw ay ull gain weight when u need to dont worry about it remeber at leate ur not over|`|piLv0WBraa	Yes you are def in the underweight category. Remember you want to gain healthy weight and not fat. In order to gain weight no matter what, you have to increase your calories- you must eat more calories than you burn. Make sure to eat lots of protein, whole grains, fruit, and green leafy vegetables. Make sure you are eating 3 meals/day and try to fit in a few healthy snacks in between (maybe a fruit smoothie or protein shake or small bag of nuts/trail mix)<br>  Also as counterintuitive as some many think, you need to exercise- both aerobics and to tone your body- weight resistance. <br>  Maybe seek a nutritionist that can help you/guide you. But at 5'4 and 91 lbs you really should be putting on some more HEALTHY weight- for not only physical appearance but for a healthy functioning body.|`|83QrwIJZaa	Some people (like you) just have very fast metabolisms, and are naturally in the underweight category. If you really WANT to gain weigh--and I mean YOU, not because people say you're too skinny, but because you are uncomfortable with being so thin--talk to your doctor about weight gain. Eating unhealthy to gain weight or any of those other crazy things just isnt, well, healthy. I know products like Ensure or Boost are sometimes used as weight gain supplements, and they are healthy. You can find them at any place like Wal-Mart, Target, HEB, etc. And you just drink them in addition to whatever meals/snacks you eat. They come in chocolate, strawberry, vanilla and a variety of other flavors. Personally, I prefer Ensure.|`|AB5erhhUaa	Just eat unhealthy :)|`|XxuTil84aa	i think you should eat more. im just saying. maybe thats the answer to your problems. >.>

If you eat right and exercise then you will grow properly, but the body uses our sleep to help repair muscle tearing (due to exercise) and to grow out the bones and body. So in a way yes the more you sleep, the more you grow!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|D0xmpaaOaa	Well i think that you'll grow as tall as you can be, but if you don't sleep you won't get taller.

aaGaMsJQaa	Vaginal yeast infections occur when new yeast is introduced into the vaginal area, or when there is an increase in the quantity of yeast already present in the vagina relative to the quantity of normal bacteria. For example, when the normal, protective bacteria are eradicated by antibiotics (taken to treat a urinary tract, respiratory, or other types of infection) or by immunosuppressive drugs, the yeast can multiply, invade tissues, and cause irritation of the lining of the vagina (vaginitis).<br>  <br>  Vaginal yeast infections can also occur as a result of injury to the inner vagina, such as after chemotherapy. Also, women with suppressed immune systems (for example, those taking cortisone-related medications such as prednisone) develop vaginal yeast infections more frequently than women with normal immunity. Other conditions that may predispose women to developing vaginal yeast infections include diabetes mellitus, pregnancy, and taking oral contraceptives. The use of douches or perfumed vaginal hygiene sprays may also increase a woman's risk of developing a vaginal yeast infection.

XE3E4i3iaa	I've never heard of doctors performing such procedures, but there might be such a thing.

T73Y6BnWaa	No it isn't bad. I wish my parents didn't get me cut.<br>  <br>  Advantages: Nerves are not as broken up. It lets you have much more powerful feelings when you ejaculate.<br>  Allows you to insert your penis into a women's vagina easier.<br>  <br>  Disadvantages: People consider it "dirty" (only for people who don't know who to clean it.<br>  The foreskin can be tight and not be easy to bring down.<br>  You have to pull it back during sex.|`|TsjqzanQaa	Being uncircumcised is being unmutilated, natural and normal, and having a complete penis with a foreskin, the way that nature intended.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is an abnormal and unnatural mutilation of the penis.<br>  <br>  Circumcision damages the penis and sexual sensitivity.<br>  The foreskin with its thousands of nerve endings is amputated.      Nerves are severed.    Veins are severed.    Remaining nerve endings on the penis are damged.     Scar tissue is formed.     The blood flow of the penis is permanently disrupted.     The penis is smaller as a result.      <br>  <br>  The glans and surrounding tissues are exposed permanently, and they dry out and keratinize.     These factors all combine to reduce sexual sensitivity an average of 50-75%, and more in come cases.<br>  <br>  The foreskin also has Langerhans cells, which have antiviral an antibacterial properties, and it's been proven that circumcised men are more susceptible to HIV and other diseases.       Uncircumcised men have a slightly lower rate of STDs, and a much lower rate of HIV.<br>  <br>  At the height of the HIV epidemic, 80% of the men in the USA were circumcised, and the USA had, and has, a much higher rate of HIV than in any of the countries in Europe, Asia, South America and Scandinavia where males are rarely mutilated by circumcision.<br>  <br>  There are absolutely no advantages to circumcision, other than to the doctors who make money from it, and are very often members of the religions that want to circumcise all males.<br>  <br>  Circumcision is the worst hoax ever perpetrated on the male sex.<br>  <br>  A foreskin is not a birth defect; it is a birthright.<br>  <br>  ERIC|`|937d8516b6bac65675aebed05fbfdfc9aa	no it is not bad it is the best so be happy i prefer it|`|QBUypAmAaa	No, it's the way men were born, so there's nothing bad about it.<br>  There are no disadvantages either, it's wonderful to have foreskin as it keeps the penis moist and sensitive the way it is supposed to be. It's the most pleasurable part of a man's penis with over 20000 nerve endings and allows sex to be performed with ease and great pleasure. Just a little cleaning has to be done routinely, but that should apply for all penises regardless if intact/uncircumcised or not.<br>  <br>  -KH|`|i6RlYFo7aa	no, why would it be?<br>  <br>  there are no disadvantages, it keeps the head protected and it feels good for sex<br>  <br>  and before anyone brings up the tired "hygiene" issue:<br>  neither cut or uncut is cleaner than the other, both need to wash|`|47l1Sumeaa	No, there is nothing wrong with it although it is known to be more hygenic if you are circumcised.|`|m18D5BXpaa	i would say either way you have to keep yourself very clean<br>  especially under your foreskin|`|xuCY36yWaa	MUST keep it clean under the foreskin .if you any woman to do the good thing! i am cut tho! bienrad is wrong!|`|4f861da13e3f26c7f99940320c6fee08aa	no  which ever 1 u are its fine as long as you keep it clean its all awesome|`|kSEO2w8Aaa	no it looks good and stays cleaner though

If it was thicker and sticky it probably was your first ejaculation.  However if it was the same consistency as urine it probably was just pre-come.  Pre-come usually emerges just before the sperm does.  Pre-come comes from the prostate and helps the sperm move along through the penis and into the vagina.|`|HlEUfyF3aa	First off, i would have suggested putting that gooey little liquid between your tounge and roof of your mouth.

He might grow until his early 20s, but even if he does, I don't think it will get much bigger (maybe 1/2" at most)  But I always think its weird when girls complain about guys being too small.  I've never had a girl too loose for me, and I'm average size...<br>  <br>  As for not being able to get it back up after the first round...most guys can't.

Once you have an orgasm, your body has to go through a refractory period.|`|3faz90KDaa	sometimes its like ten minutes|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	Depends.  I was able to ejaculate then was able to ejaculate again 10 minutes later.  Each guy is different.  Give it a try just to satisfy your own curiosity.  Some guys might be an hour and some might be immediately after the first ejaculation.  With women they can experience orgasm after orgasm without stopping.  There is no limit to how many they can have.  They are so lucky!|`|A9JV4uAxaa	10 minutes for me...ik some guys that it takes like 5 minutes|`|T73Y6BnWaa	i can go again 10 seconds after my first one.

Wf83LhUMaa	The therapy will help, with not only ur own problems but ur mom situation. Tell ur therapist about ur mom and ask for there advise. u could also explain to ur mom that its things she says that makes u angry and upset and that she should be supportive through ur tough time and understand ur situation. But I would wait to talk to the therapist- they're the professionals.|`|RDL3wC62aa	sheesh theres only one way to prove it and thats way isnt acceptable, sorry but I really don't know maybe once the therapist speaks to your mother she'll get it (unless you have him not tell her things)|`|5PIgZ7tFaa	Sounds like your mom is in denial. There are still people out there who stigmatize mental illness. You will have to be the adult in this situation, and get help on your own. <br>      That kind of invalidation is more likely to cause more depression than it will help. A parent makes a mistake when they try to minimize their kids' mental health issues. Maybe they think it's a reflection on their parenting. But please do not try to PROVE that you are having these thoughts and feelings. You are not capable of changing what your mother chooses to believe/disbelieve. As long as you're getting the help you need, then you are moving forward. Keep it up!|`|BS9pRP97aa	your moms crazy lol. but i know how you feel sorta. its good that you called your friend before you tried to commit suicide. it proves that you really didnt wanna do it. so just stick through it. your mom will get it soon enough|`|xtcSsPPwaa	let me guess... your white? you have a nice house? you go to a good school?<br>  <br>  what the hell is the problem?<br>  Are you weak minded? <br>  I hate people like that.|`|J4hOL3oLaa	the first answer to this question was ridiculous. Material things have nothing to do with a chemical imbalance that you cannot control on your own. It is hard to talk to parents about these things. If you can, sit with her and talk to her about the thoughts and feelings you are having, or write her a letter. She may be in denial and just scared for you. If you cannot rely on your mom for support, then talk to a teacher or counselor or designate a friend who is willing to come to you when you have these feelings or atleast be able to talk to you on the phone until you feel better. I hope you find the support you need. Good luck!|`|2E39owb9aa	don't feel like you have to prove yourself to anyone including your mom..she's probably in denial and doesn't want to believe that you truly have a problem..you're young you have the rest of your life ahead of you all the problems you have now will soon blow over if you make the right decisions and killing yourself is definitely not the solution.. just stay true to yourself because at the end of the day all you have is yourself|`|AA10712795	I would recommend bringing your mother with you to one of your therapy sessions so she can see what's going on.  Your counselor might be able to share some insight with your mother on what sort of things you are going through.  That would hopefully open her eyes to the serious nature of your situation. <br>  As I've been the down a similar road in my past and I'm sure many others have, remember this when you're down, the only way is up.  Think about it.  You may be at a crossroad in your life, but jumping off the road is not quite the answer.  The answer is choosing the right path.  Safe journeys and good luck.|`|leF0EHQxaa	my advice would be to ignore your mom and just get help from your counselors she is probably just afraid that if you really are depressed then it is her fault parents are obnoxious in that way or she thinks that you are just going through a phase maybe if you wanted you could ask your counselor to to talk to your mom or just find a way to talk to her and calmly explain exactly how you feel i know that it will be hard (truthfully i haven't even told anyone how i feel and i tried to kill myself 4 times so maybe my advice is useless idk) i hope this helps

Please talk to your mom.  And as far as helping you with keeping food down, is it that you feel sick to your stomach and throw up involuntarily when you eat, or is it that you can't help but make yourself throw up?  If its just that you automatically throw up without making yourself do it, it's probably just your body trying to adjust to food again, or you could be overeating since you are literally starving yourself to death.  Try eating bland foods for awhile like rice, grilled cheese sandwich, carrot sticks, apples, etc.  Eventually you will be fine if you really do start eating normally again.

How would you like your life to be different each day?  What would make you enjoy thinking about the present?  Are there things you can look forward to doing in the next week?  Can you make plans with friends?  I hope you will choose to think about what is going on right now. If this seems too hard to do, you might want to talk to  someone.  Best Wishes.
iuKQBaaRaa	I have been a loner all of my life.  Back in grade school, that was always brought up at teacher/parent conferences.  I had a few friends here and there, but was never in a group or clique; always felt I wasn't good enough to be a part of a group.  <br>  As for solving this issue, well, I quit trying so hard to "fix" things and just started living life.  And then one day, I found who I really was.  I quit trying to be what I thought other people expected me to be and somehow I started being happy.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	you have SAD<br>  <br>  this can be treated with temporary medication for the fall and winter season<br>  make a doctors appointment for meds|`|uKmNYqGgaa	I have three of the 150-watt compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs in my room.

9pLdhuBnaa	On the listing that says just "gynecology" it means that they only take care of female problems because they are no longer delivering babies (all gynecologists are also Obstetricians but after so many years they stop delivering babies).  When it says Obstetrician/Gynecologist it means that the doctor takes care of female problems as well as delivers babies.<br>  <br>  As for the quality of a gynecologic only doctor, no the quality of care they give is still good and you may even be able to have more time during the appointment with them if you have questions.<br>  <br>  Recognized for a commitment to Quality means that they have been awarded for the outstanding care that they give to their patients.  Board certified means that the doctor has gone thru exams given by the American Board of Obestrics and Gynecology after they have been a licensed doctor for two years.<br>  <br>  For some it doesn't matter if the doctor is board certified by the American Board of Obstetrics and Gynecology.<br>  <br>  If you would like to talk some more about this please feel free to e-mail me off site any time.

L1FC2nKQaa	Emily, these days, dentures are a last resort option. They are used in young people only in cases of very rare genetic disorders when patient's teeth are abnormally designed and thus rapidly decay, for patients that are meth users, for patients that drink excessive amounts of sugar-containing soda, and sometimes patients that are bulimic. Other than that, to need dentures, one must be downright neglectful of their oral hygiene. Please try to save your teeth.  As a dental student,  I treat mostly low-income patients. Even among them, we try to avoid dentures until absolutely necessary. There are other options, such as partial dentures, crowns, and implants. I know dentistry is expensive, but listen to the facts. If you have all of your teeth extracted, within 5 years you will only be able to chew with 1/12th the strength you have now. It will be cut to 1/4th your current strength by the end of your first year in dentures. Your bone will reabsorb to the point that by the time you are 60 there will be very little bone left on which to place a denture (which is bad news- it means your old dentures won't fit and new ones will be fairly hard to make).  Dentures should be remade every 5-10 years, at the cost of about 600 each if you have them done at a dental school. <br>  <br>  What you should do is get a job and save as much money as possible to get crowns on the teeth that need them and fillings on the ones that need those. At a dental school crowns are about $500 each. Often one can find a dentist who will do free fillings on children, which you qualify as, since you are only fifteen. Research this. You should call the nearest dental school for more information. Dental schools do work at considerably reduced fees. There area also many programs available for low-income families to receive dental care free. <br>  Please, try to start doing really well with brushing and flossing. If your drinking water doesn't contain fluoride,  go purchase a fluoride containing mouthwash. Go purchase a mouthwash regardless, and use it daily. And please call the nearest dental school or public health center and ask them for ideas of what you can do to attain access to the necessary dental care. Please. <br>  <br>  Now to your question. The surgery at a dental school would cost about $75/ tooth. From what you say, you have- counting wisdom teeth- at least 28 teeth. Wisdom teeth will cost more to take out though, a couple hundred per tooth. General anesthesia will likely be in the $350-450 range at a dental school. You're looking at near 3000. Then dentures will be another 1200 at minimum. Probably closer to 2000, if you decide to get them the same day you have your teeth pulled. So you're looking at 5000. <br>  <br>  Seriously though, unless you have a genetic disorder, I hope you don't get dentures. <br>  <br>  And don't cry thinking about dental care! We're here to help! I know I sound like not a particularly nice person in this note, but that's just cuz I want you to stop thinking you need dentures! We really are nice people. Especially dental students :) Come see us, we want to help you. We will do everything we can to improve your life.

I think you were a little mean to her. If she didn't want to do it, then don't make her. Making her sit on the floor for 1/2 hour crying was pretty mean as well. She threw up because your penis hit something in her throat and made her throw up. It could happen to anyone. Next time, try being a little nicer, and she might let you do more things.|`|IRFe95eLaa	I think you're a complete jerk and you are most likely not only an abusive sexual predator but also a child molestor.  If she is "alot younger" than you and you are only 19, she's probably underage, which means you are raping her, assaulting her and emotionally and verbally abusing her.  No one should EVER make ANYONE do something they are uncomfortable with. You're lucky she didn't bite the damn thing off.  I hope she does next time, you ***.|`|zEy0uuAFaa	You should be ashamed of yourself.  You're lucky enough to have a girlfriend who tries to make you feel good by sucking you, even though it turns her off.  She wanted you to feel good so much that she took it deep enough to make her gag.  Some girls won't even kiss it, but that wasn't enough for you.  You had to follow up with something that would make her feel used and degraded.  You asked first and found out she didn't like it, and then went ahead and did it.  You might have been nice and given her a towel, but you had to humiliate her some more.  Your language implies you've hit her before.  No doubt you've chosen a young impressionable girl because she's easy to dominate and abuse to prop up your fragile ego.  She deserves better treatment.  You're a sorry excuse for a "boyfriend".  If you don't wise up, we're going to see you hauled away on "Cops" after a girlfriend gets fed up and calls 911 on you, or we may hear of you being convicted of statutory rape for taking advantage of a young girl with self-esteem issues.|`|uO5k0lCVaa	wtf is wrong with you? you're such a jack*ss i can't believe you're seriously asking this i hope she leaves you and gets her dad to beat the crap out of you.|`|9thGQOqJaa	you shouldnt have made her do anything she didnt want to! no means no!|`|e2zbF0edaa	yes you were a lil more then a little harsh|`|zk4OHLg3aa	**** you|`|4f861da13e3f26c7f99940320c6fee08aa	wow you are the biggest loser/jerk ever !!!just by the way you have treated her says everything about you...she prob hasnt left you becuz shes afraid of you with all the abuse you give to her you prob tell her shes ugly fat ect total loser is what your are..if she didnt want you to *** on her face dont get mad and it is degrading to most people but you wouldnt understand that bucz your a loser and the fact that you didnt give her anything to wipe it off make it even more bad..and the fact that you cant see what you have done i really feel sorry for you.

Cutting back on unnatural fatty foods, caffeine, food with high fructose corn syrup etc. Will make a huge difference.  Also find out if you're wheat intolerant. Vegetables, fruits, foods rich in protein.  Drink lots of water and natural juices.  Now, incorporate all of that with your routine and you should do fine.

I told them I couldn't put up with it and they said "but you have".  Ugh.  So don't put it off or the doctor's may not believe you when you say it really is a problem.
pvYy6iTSaa	babygirl - Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease is the most common inherited disorder that involves the peripheral nerves, affecting an estimated 150,000 people in the United States. It occurs in all races and ethnic groups. Worldwide, this disorder affects about 1 in 3,300 people.<br>  <br>  There are different types, as you already know.  Type X is inherited in an X-linked dominant pattern. A condition is considered X-linked if the mutated gene that causes the disorder is located on the X chromosome. The inheritance is dominant if one copy of the altered gene is sufficient to cause the condition. In most cases, males experience more severe symptoms of the disorder than females. A striking characteristic of X-linked inheritance is that fathers cannot pass X-linked traits to their sons.<br>  <br>  Some cases of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease result from a new mutation and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their family.<br>  <br>  You may find the following resources about Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease helpful. These materials are written for the general public.<br>  <br>  MedlinePlus - Health information (4 links)<br>  Additional NIH Resources - National Institutes of Health (3 links)<br>  Educational resources - Information pages (19 links)<br>  Patient support - For patients and families (5 links)|`|lPO4D8PLaa	This disease is a genetic disease passed on in an autosomal dominant fashion.  What that means is that since your father had it (and your mother didn't), all of your parent's children have a 50% chance of getting it.  You can find out by doing genetic tests or if you have the symptoms.  The symptoms (foot drop, hammer toes, high arch in foot, neurological symptoms) start appearing in late childhood.  There is ongoing current research exporing vitamin C in helping treat this disease.|`|9l1TEKr1aa	You can find out more about CMT genetics and inheritance here:<br>  <a href="http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about_cmt/genetics.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.charcot-marie-tooth.org/about...</a>

ReeqgnwZaa	Are you sure you don't have a fever?  It is not normal to feel such a temperature increase if you do not have a fever.  You may be having an allergic reaction to the antibiotics.  Are you feeling any swelling or itchiness in your hands or feet?  How about any swelling (other than the tonsilitis) in your throat or roof of your mouth?  If you are having an allergic reaction it is serious and you need to take a trip to the emergency room.  You may want to call your local hospital and describe your symptoms and tell them which antibiotics you are on and see what they think.|`|MLFaEBmEaa	My son suffered acute tonsillitis since Dec. 2007. He suffered with high fever every month & even twice a month. Searching for an answer with prayers is the best we can do as parents. Drinking antibiotics every month makes me worry and most especially when my 5yr old son screaming for the paint for having a high fever and his eyes is burning. It will definitely breaks your heart. Until God answered my prayer. The disease came back this 02.13.09. Our Charismatic leader endorsed me this BARLEY ESSENTIAL a food supplement. I increased the dosage since his first medication as 1/2 sachet for 3xday last 02.02.09. I let my son drink the Barley 1 sachet for 3xday starting the night he suffered the disease. On 02.14.09, morning came the exudative white patches starting to disappear. Prayer, Faith and Medication is the answer. Praise Be The Lord JESUS Christ. See www.spemhealtcare.com

iGUW85iFaa	your body is constantly burning calories even if you are sitting still or sleeping. I don't know that it would have to do with being comfortable, but maybe the interactions that you have at school make you physically do more or get your heart rate up a bit more than you would at home. I wish I could help you more, but this is an interesting question.|`|VmSKQ40Caa	You must be, I am also fairly tired when I get home.|`|B12E4rYiaa	The more you move the more you burn the faster you move the more you burn so if you want to lose you move a lot and you move fast.|`|qSxaYG0qaa	Hi, yes you actually burn more calories when you are at school walking around than sitting on your couch. Although, you do burn calories sitting on your couch, but you always burn more when you and standing and moving more.<br>  <br>  When I was in school and I had free days I used to go volunteer in a school so that I would move more because I could just sit all day watching TV. And I LOVED to volunteer there. If you worry about the calories or want to burn more, find an activity that will make you want to get up and do it!<br>  <br>  <br>  I am telling you, you always burn calories, even sitting on the toilet makes you burn calories!<br>  Try : Fitday.com, it's great, you can enter what you eat during the day and all the activities you do and it tells you how many calories you ate and how many you burn to see if you gain or lose weight.

I'm not exactly sure how many more calories you're burning, though.|`|4CsGde1qaa	You only burn calories when you move and divide your daily caloric intake by 3, 4 or 5.

AA11846603	Seriously, this sounds like a panice disorder.  This happened to me not too long ago and I thought something was wrong with me.  They tested me my blood and urine for everything and they couldnt find anything.  They even tested me for a peanut allergy!! They found out that I had a panic disorder and they put me on zoloft.  Within a week, all my symptoms were gone.  I know that you are set on thinking that something else is wrong with you, but I would be open to the idea that it is a panic disorder.  Like I said, I didnt want to think that it was a panic disorder, but I also didnt want to live like that so I took my doctors advice and started the zoloft regimen.  Hope you figure this out and everything gets better!  GOOD LUCK!|`|9lapW9mUaa	diabetes???

I suffer from social anxiety disorder and what you describe is what I have gone through many times in my life.  Yes you should see a therapist they can help you to learn to control them.

The feelings of unreality are called derealization/depersonalization and are your brain's defense mechanisms to cope with the anxiety. There is nothing dangerous about what you are experiencing - they are just feelings.....your body's "fight or flight" response is out of whack. Please see a mental health professional so you can get this taken care of.|`|sR6NlPsDaa	I have no idea what this is, either. I've never seen it before, so getting these tests done should help. Don't panic about dying! That could be the cause! The first one could have happened, i don't know, because your body had a problem. But if you think you are gonna die, then that IS stress. You need to calm down, and relax and take deep breaths. Think of things that make you happy. Your not gonna die, trust me. Your body is just trying to alert you of something. These tests will be able to tell the doctor what is wrong, and help fix it. It could even be hormones if it is happening at night. Girls hormones are triggered sometimes my the moon, so don't panic! Calm your self before you go to the doctor, and maybe try some searches on yahoo, google, etc. Go on wikipedia, or a health website. Even call a phone number on a heath website!! I hope everything eds up to be okay for you :)<br>  <br>  Hope I really helped you out :)
MDxakcB4aa	I promice its anxeity. I am the EXACT same way and have had to come to face it over many years. See a counselor and see what severe effects the human mind can have over how your body is physically feeling. It will blow you away. Anexity and panic disorders and very crazy things. I KNOW. Just take one step at a time. Some medicine is a start. If the meds don't work after a while then you can diagnose your self with other things you think may be wrong. Good luck.|`|2X1V6Mwnaa	I have a panic/anxiety disorder and i get hot and sweaty and my chest feels tight and i have a hard time breathing and get upset...ETC. Sounds like that's what you might have. It can strike even if you have no stress or aren't sad no matter...its little things that set it off. Trust me i know ive dealt with it since forever. Good luck|`|4KDDFobnaa	It sort of sounds like an anxiety disorder or a panic disorder to me. This happened to me, as well. Maybe you have subconscious stress and anxieties. It could also be post-traumatic stress, if something traumatic has happened in your life. I'm sure you won't die, it sounds like an anxiety disorder to me, but talk it over with some doctors.
dwLqreuvaa	Yes that has happened to me aswell, what you can do is to get rid of some swelling rinse with salt and water (sea salt not table salt) and rinse and repeat, the swelling should go down.<br>  <br>  As for your lip, i would just put on some medicated chapstick (for cold sores or chapped lips) So then you won't get an infection on your lip and it will heal faster. Another idea is to get aloe vera and constantly reapply it on your lips.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped good luck|`|r2j2PgIBaa	I'm sorry you have to go through the same pain I am.  It hurts A TON the best thing you can do is ice it or put cream (like for canker-sores) on the infected parts.  hope you feel better and that this helps!|`|yzKrwvxSaa	it should die down after a couple days. i went through the same problem. best thing you can do is take a pain killer or numb it with and ice cream.
tDaU7eYXaa	NO! IT DOESN'T WORK!!! Who wants to be skinny, frail, and weak!!! HUH!?!? YOU HAVE to WoRK ouT!!! YOu get stronger and lose wieght the normal way!!! BAH! Useless diets... This crap isn't good! I suppose it might work... BUT WHO THE HECK WANTS TO BE EXTREMELY WEAK AND FRAGILE!?!?! Just work out. It feels good. You can save money. You don't have to eat that toxic crap. Did people have that before? I Don't Think So.... C'mon! Work out! I am SO against diets. I tried once and developed a very long and severe eating disorder. I LOVE working out. You get stronger...maybe even in your love life *wink wink*. But SERIOUSLY... just TRY to get lean and ripped at the same time (not exactly ripped, but still strong enough).|`|Kv5BA0cgaa	YES!!

I was stuck at my weight loss goals and this brought me through it and made me lose a lot of weight.  So in my opinion it helped me lose weight tremendously.  I know a lot of that dieting stuff is expensive but I found a free trial of Acai Berry(I think it only cost me like 7-8 bucks at the time for shipping.)  The site was   <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> -  All I did was try it out for a month and I was sold,  I saw the results I wanted to and like I said I was in that plateau with my weight loss.  This kicked it up a bunch.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope this helps.
Hvp96yKzaa	I wouldn't recommend Murad Acne or Pro Activ. I suggest you go to a dermatologist and have them see what treatment is best for you. They'll ask you about your skin (whether you have oil skin, sensitive, etc) and they'll ask you about your acne (like how long have you had acne prone skin). Then they'll give you your treatment.<br>  <br>  Save your money. The expensive treatments don't work. Professionals know skin and which treatment is right.|`|iCMrsV9daa	Try pro-active solution

dwLqreuvaa	If you meant indents like ridges, this is not uncommon,<br>  I had massive ridges on my teeth when i was younger but my dentist said, with brushing and eating the groove iin you teeth will get worn down. I still have slight grooves but you dont notice them. They are usually called pits and fissures or mamelons. They make it possible to tear and chew food.<br>  <br>  They can be smoothened by a dentist but that can go through your enamel and cause sensativity, but by eating and brushing your teeth, time will make the grooves disapear. Good luck :D<br>  <br>  Don't worry about anything :) It can also be a chip, but as you explained on TWO of your front teeht im just assuming they are mamelons

UZJ7wVc8aa	Getting a nice set of abs is such a misunderstood process. It's actually a lot easier than most people think which is why most people are in a never ending quest to get that perfect six pack - it's because they're doing all the wrong things.<br>  <br>  When you eat more calories than you burn, your body takes those extra calories and stores them as fat somewhere on your body. For some people, the #1 fat storage area is around the thighs and for others it might be around the stomach - it differs from person to person. Sometimes the fat is perfectly distributed around the body so it's not as big of a concern. <br>  <br>  If an excessive amount of fat is stored around your stomach, the reason that you're not seeing your abs is because your body fat percentage is too high. What you need to do is create a calorie deficit (take in less calories than you burn) so that your body is forced to use its fat stores for energy. After a few weeks of doing this, you'll notice that your abs will start to show.<br>  <br>  You first step is to figure out how many calories you burn each day. Use this calculator <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> for an estimate. Now you need to increase the amount of calories you burn by exercising more and decreasing the amount of calories you eat. Cut out junk food such as fast food, candy and sugar. Eat foods that are high in fiber: bread and pasta made from 100% whole wheat, brown rice, oats, fruits and vegetables.<br>  <br>  You shouldn't ignore targeting your abs with sit ups, leg raises and twists but doing hundreds of sit ups won't do anything about the layer of fat that is covering them. Cardio and calorie restriction should be your main focus. If you need more details on getting a six pack, visit The Guide to Getting Nice Abs - <a href="http://www.straightabs.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.straightabs.com</a>|`|NQM54pUkaa	I read something in a magazine that one of them jumps rope to stay in shape.

TXddP0uxaa	Here's a bright idea:  Don't try to perform surgical procedures on yourself.   Seriously, its a really bad move.  Always have a licensed professional do any piercings, and visit a doctor if you experience any unusual pain or swelling.  You can get serious infections or PERMANENT nerve damage if a piercing is done incorrectly.|`|AAgX0SDcaa	I don't think they know exactly. My dentist would warn me when he was giving shots in mouth that I might feel something like an electrical shock, and to touch his sleeve and he would stop. From my own experience it wasn't fun touching a nerve with a needle.|`|sP3UtfJ1aa	well if u hit a nerve it will bleed alot <br>  but thats the only thing i no for a fact|`|CzZPFS0zaa	The idea that the lip has no nerve endings is almost as ridiculous as the idea that you will bleed more if you hit one. Here is a piece on the anatomy of lips:<br>  <br>  "The infraorbital nerve is a branch of the maxillary branch. It supplies not only the upper lip, but much of the skin of the face between the upper lip and the lower eyelid, except for the bridge of the nose. <br>  The mental nerve is a branch of the mandibular branch. It supplies the skin and mucous membrane of the lower lip and labial gingiva (gum) anteriorly."<br>  <br>  So yes, there are nerves that run to your lips. The best way not to do any damage to your lip is to have a trained professional pierce it for you. The risks of doing nerve damage are far smaller than the very real chance of you leaving a bad scar or giving yourself an infection. You are not going to be able to properly sterilize any of the items you use. (and no, boiling them does not sterilize it, nor does alcohol or peroxide.) <br>  <br>  I would definitely think before you end up hurting yourself. There is a lot more to piercing than just sticking a hole somewhere. Things to think of are what size jewelry do you need, what material should it be made of, how are you going to know the difference between high grade and low grade metal? How do you care for it? Will the jewelry allow for swelling, what if it gets too tight? If you can't answer all that and way more without having to look it up, put down the needle and get it done the right way.|`|RYf3sf6Daa	don't do it yourself!! theres a lot of don't ask don't tell places that will do it with no ID and won't ask your name (go there if ur under 18 or 16 or whatever the age is where u live) <br>  i pierced my belly button 2 years ago and it got infected and i had to take it out (plus it was lopsided)|`|lSooXAQTaa	Honestly, how stupid are you for getting your lip pierced? There are Absolutely no nerves in your lip.
JPfraSk9aa	You should ask the team Doctor.  Even if your pain is on the outside ball it could be caused from the bottom.

If you aren't and the guy is pressuring you into this then all he is after is your cherry and he will leave as soon as he gets what he wants.  My friend didn't listen to me when i told her this now she is pregnant and he wants her to get an abortion and she wants to keep it so he won't support it at all.  My other friend got left as soon as the guy got what he wanted.  So please ask yourself if this is the right thing or is it just what he wants.  You may think he loves you (if he is your boyfriend and pressuring you to do this)  He may say that if you don't then you aren't good enough for him.  Well you know what he isn't good enough for you.  he is just another player looking to put a girl down so he can have another notch added to his man hood while the girl is called names and hurtful things.<br>  <br>  If you are married or engaged then I hope it goes well... i think!|`|7d84621e89c49bcba037226d3361c90baa	Well, not for everyone.

Nothing you can't handle.|`|MeeJWmGtaa	Didn't hurt me one bit :D|`|QWylMGLGaa	Yes.|`|xzMkUCizaa	Everyone is different! The reason why it "hurts" is because of something called the Hymen. The first time you have sex the hymen is stretched and it is why some women bleed. For some women the hymen is already stretched and they do not bleed and it does not hurt as much.<br>  Another reason it might hurt is because your body is tense, you might be nervous so your muscles down there tense up. There are many other different reasons and everyone's experience is different but it is a different kind of pain as long as you are with the right person who is willing to be patient and follow your body's signs.|`|2G0a5zUSaa	Yes it usually does.

For me it hurt just a little right at first, but the guy involved was gentle and it stopped hurting almost immediately.  Some friends have told me that it was really painful and they actually had to stop halfway through.  The pain is caused by the rupturing of the hymen, which can happen any number of ways -- tampons, injuries, even strenuous physical activity.  If yours has already been partially removed, it might not hurt at all.  Either way, it's really not as scary as it sounds, and any guy worth giving your virginity to will be careful and stop what he's doing as soon you tell him it's hurting you.|`|Sf6RCvK9aa	oh yes, it hurts a lot. those girls who say it doesn't, are lying.

sQu3LLqtaa	Females usually stop growing at 15 and males at 18.  Further height growth after those ages is possible but uncertain.|`|8WYWEDOpaa	I don't think that 30/40 degree curves affect your height that much.  As for rods, if you don't need them then you don't need them.  You're right about not getting them now.<br>  <br>  Your doctor made an estimate on how tall you were going to get.  There's no way that anyone can predict exactly how tall you'll get when the prediction is 25 years before you actually quit growing.  I don't think anything can make you grow taller, although bad nutrition can make you grow less.  Good reason to eat healthy.<br>  <br>  Back to your curve.  But, your curve is at the point where it might increase even after you're done growing.  If your curve does increase, you may start having pain many years down the road.  At some point, rods are the only way to treat your back.|`|Wj1TU2ZGaa	You are not completely growing until around age 25.

crrK58F4aa	Generally a cyst sits under the skin and is like a hard ball of fat. There is generally no redness on the surface. It is possible for people of all ages to get cysts. I have one on my thigh, my shoulder and even on my scalp and have had them for years, all benign. <br>  <br>  It sounds like it could be an ingrown hair.

It could be a depression or other mental or physical things, ask your doctor about it.<br>  <br>  Giggle Giggle from the guy above me,  it's called Ginko Biloba and I suppose I would forget to take it too!|`|rhuhp6KCaa	that sounds very serious, you should go to your dr.|`|1ea8f3284e0e48434f41404ea2c2f299aa	There is something you can take to help with memory.

TQIXOOuLaa	i would say only drink COLD water because diet pop still is bad for you. And only eat fruit and vegtables during the day and eat 3 times a day !!!    Because i used to strave my self i still do you dont want to to so that its horrible i have bones sticking out and hair loss !!|`|hSOEgpPNaa	You should eat 6 small meals a day to speed up your metabolism.  Don't drink soda of any kind, only drink water.  Don't eat corn dogs, eat chicken or tuna.|`|dh4VR3jbaa	diet soda suks just drink water and have lots and lots of sex|`|k8BIPMuTaa	eat 6 small meals a dayy!!!!|`|BcAGdEkqaa	I don't think eating only once a day is a good idea. In my opinion is unhealthy you should eat more than once a day just choose healthy options. Walking is a great idea.   I lost 15 pounds just by walking for 30 minutes everyday and by eating less sugars.|`|b64219f408e63daa3f8c2cba4d84a232aa	Just eat healthy and excersise!!

I went to Wikipedia earlier when I looked at this question and what the posting was basically saying is that "blue green algae" is not really algae at all, but cyanobacteria. Cyanobacteria comes in toxic and non-toxic forms, and probably what you might be thinking about is Spirulina, which is one type of cyanobacteria. the bioavailability of B-12 is still being debated. It is considered a whole food and has been used as a nutritional supplement for a very long time. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirulina_(...  Chlorella ( a green alga) has also been used as a food source. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorella|`|VoJR0a2Eaa	Very informative article hereunder:    http://www.millenium2.org/sbgaart/sbganu...

tYk1G8Qlaa	It could be a few things like anxiety, stress, worry, depression and maybe not getting enough sleep. But i would suggest to go to your doctor and tell him/her about what is happening and they will help you.<br>  <br>  I hope you feel better soon hun.|`|ropZvmRDaa	Have you considered going to a therapist hun. There is probally just something on your mind that is messing you up. My mother had the same problem a few months ago, then I suggested her to go to a therapist then she was fine after a few weeks. You just need to get some stuff out once in a while.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweety.|`|OpduZC3Eaa	Have you been under a lot of stress lately?<br>  <br>  Any depression or anxiety?<br>  <br>  If not then I suggest you go to your doctor and try to figure this out. Or do your research! That usually helps to.
ef6f1b87cab54ac53455974cfb653177aa	I agree with healthynut84, if youre looking to suck in your stomach and poke out your ribs they will stick out. You are probably arching your back too, which adds to the ribs protruding. I have wondered the same thing, as I am trying to lose weight in my midsection, and as I have lost some, I have noticed that they have stuck out less because they have a thinner layer of fat over them. It's just they way your stomach is shaped, but excercise will shape it the way you want it.|`|H7caccziaa	Targetted weight loss is quite hard, many people would state impossible, nevertheless the sole method that really showed results for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a limited number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 30 pounds, it really does work!|`|6v4KYFGoaa	If your ribs are already sticking out then I don't think you need to lose weight...but actually gain weight.|`|W44s29nlaa	if it sticks out alot, ur losing too much weight|`|gioE9p4eaa	your ribs will become flat.  Here is the real story.  Your body has to be hot.  If it is then your flat stomach is sexy.  Hopefully you are not anorixic.  Whatever the case, the way you feel about youself is most important.  You are the best you will ever be right now!!!!|`|LuYXfp6faa	yeah if u continue 2 do this|`|FaVYRoXqaa	pretty much everyone's ribs stick out when they suck in or flatten their stomach...|`|AA11383122	if you can see your ribs when you suck in your stomach you don't have to lose any weight.

Nage3N1Faa	if its just churping like 2 beeps every few minutes then the batteries are deing.<br>  If not then you should call 911.<br>  Replace the batteries just to make sure its not a battery issue.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	change the batterys see if it beeps|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Batteries are going dead.

Is the beeping very loud? It would probably use a very loud sound that would be easily heard throughout the house if it were for a detection of carbon monoxide.|`|dE7b0odvaa	It could be any of those.  It's probably fine, but I wouldn't just let that go.  Call the fire department and ask them this question.  They would know for sure.
mViF9s8uaa	Put on Neosporin before you go to bed. Then (I know this is a hassle) get up at 3 AM and re apply it, but this time with Vaseline added. Just be sure not to put on Chapstick, because that adds moisture when you want to dry it out. This works! P.S. Do you have any other type of cream or pill treatment available? Put those on on top of the others if so. Too much is never too much!!
683fba774a10fec8e7e8b8ea4c6b7561aa	Your age and the symptoms explained are not suggestive of any cancer. Please forget thinking about a cancer now, and relax!|`|kA0xb0MVaa	Not at all.  You are in a growing spurt.  Your body grows best when asleep.|`|w4EusdX3aa	Highly doubtful.  If your that worried go to the doctor.|`|2ObqoJbKaa	There are plenty of reasons why you might be getting extra tired lately and be achy. I wouldn't jump to the conclusion immediately  that you have cancer. If you are really worried tho, I would advise going to the doctor and having some tests run. Then you will know for sure. but your probably fine. Don't worry too much. good luck.
niBK8Jz6aa	Exercise is just as pivotal as calorie intake when it comes to losing weight, but the one method that clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be checked out in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and USA Today. I worked off 25 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|kFECmFGLaa	I haven't personally. But I worked at a day camp for kids who were off track or summer break and we had a DDR in the jungle gym area and that was the kids favorite thing to do, some of the bigger kids started to thin out. not a lot obviouslyy but you could tell that there faces were getting thinner. Im not sure how there home life was if they played outside etc. but we had them for about 8-9 hours a day from morning til evening Im sure if you eat healthy and do that for cardio you will lose weight. good luck : )
YuV4bgyLaa	I'm assuming the infestation is fleas or bed bugs.  Both are notoriously difficult to get rid of.  There are numerous fumigation/treatment sprays available but none of them will work 100% unless you're aggressive about it.  <br>  Fumigating and bombing won't do a thing if the bed bugs/fleas are in closet linens/bed cracks/anything they can hide in.  The best thing to do is thoroughly clean EVERYTHING.  <br>  Wash every sheet, shirt, pillow, towel.  Bag them tightly after washing.  Expose any areas they can hide.  Open closets, empty drawers.  Then fumigate.<br>  As far as kidney problems, it's not likely.  The kidney problems are generally due to the pests devouring more blood from the host than they can produce.  This can happen in infested dogs and cats, but not generally in human beings.<br>  Bed bugs and fleas can, however, carry nasty illnesses and bacteria and infected bites are common.
XzV4bUeFaa	I absolutely hate winter and the grey skies.  It's so despressing.  Try guided imagery.  There are CDs out there for relaxation/mediatation purposes.  Get one where the person talks you through the "imagery"  Many will talk about peaceful, warm, sunny beaches!  This does help.  Also there are special lights sold to mimic the spectrum of the sun.  These also help.  I try to do things outside (shop, doctor's appt, etc) on days when it's not TOO COLD.  Then when it's totally unbearable i try to stay indoors, and do activities I find entertaining.  Or, when possible have company over.|`|e9jMEaJVaa	I know the feelings, I have SAD as well. You can get a special light from your doctor called a light therapy box. I never tried this but I heard it works pretty good.  I have my own personal remedies that seem to work just as well. In all my lamps around the house I use light bulbs that simulate natural light, they are made by phillips. If you aren't against going to tanning salons, I've found that going tanning for one week each month helps a lot also.   I also take a vitamin before bed called Sleep 'N Restore, its a combination of melatonin and valerian that helps to promote natural sleep patterns and helps your body's natural restoration process.     Hope all this helps.. Good luck :-)|`|HNnVrvCfaa	http://www.betterlifehealthcare.com/prod...|`|0hSpsSByaa	I understand doctors are having some success with special lights that have a spectrum similar to the sun.
OMYd6p3gaa	To me it seems that you are eating a lot of sugar. Sugar in your diet would be in the milk, protein bar and fruit juice. Cut back on that. I suggest you have 2 fruit a day, 1 bread (1 slice=1 full bread serving) a cup of cereal = 1 serving, 16 oz of vegetables a day with minimal dressing if desired, 7 oz protein/day (I know you are vegetarian but tofu as well as beans are sources of protein) as much jello as you want. Keep up with the exercise and drink AT LEAST 10 glasses of water a day!! Dont drink too much caffeine ( 1 cup of coffee a day is plenty!) I do this everyday, and dont even excercise and I have lost 10 pounds/month!!! I hope this works out for you!|`|5lsQlfqXaa	make sure you're eating every 3 hours, small + regular meals are best<br>  <br>  the extra weight is probably muscle? muscle weighs more than fat, as you'd probably know, so this could be the reason. 150 sit-ups is A LOT, and so is 2 - 5hours other physical activity..|`|IJrsH2tGaa	To be honest, it doesn't sound like you're eating enough. A common misconception is that if you eat less, you will lose weight. This is not the case, and can usually have quite the opposite effect. First of all, there is not near enough protein in your diet. A protein bar is not near enough. Depending on your activity level, height, and gender .. I'm assuming that you are female... you probably need about 27-49 grams of protein daily. And a protein bar will usually provide 15 grams. Because you are vegetarian, it is much harder to meet the daily required intake of protein, and also many other things that a non-vegetarian diet would provide. I would strongly suggest finding a vegetarian cookbook, and also doing more research on the vegetarian lifestyle. Or even talk to a nutritionist. Because quite honestly, your diet is incredibly unhealthy. <br>  Also, 150-200 sit-ups everyday alone will not give you abs. Which it sounds that you are looking for. It involves many different abdominal exercises, and also rigorous cardio. It's hard for me to tell you exactly what you should be doing in terms of exercises, so I would strongly hiring a personal trainer, even just for a few sessions. Believe me, I was someone who thought personal trainers were a scam, and demanded far too much money. But my aunt convinced me one day to hire one for a few sessions, and they really helped me out in terms of developing an exercise and weight loss program suited for me.|`|y2ZLVTPGaa	first off it does not appear you are eating enougbh calories and are likely hoarding your calories as a result (starvation mode).  especially for your activity level eat more, lots more, while doing cardio.  but eat more|`|0kYCwThIaa	Yea, I agree with the other poster you probably are not getting enough calories. But also you need to do more explosive cardio to burn fat. You should think about getting a heavy bag and take up boxing(if you have the time). Also think about getting a jump rope.

Try drinking half a cup of that, and you'll make a very weird face, and your glands will start producing a lot of saliva.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	Mentioning. Acid reflux is heartburn. Have you ever eaten anything and then you feel a burning in your throat and chest and it feels like your food is coming back up your throat ? that is acid reflux. What happens is your esophagus muscles relax and the acids in your stomach force their way back up in it. It is painful and can damage your esophagus ( the tube in your throat that allows food to go down to your stomach).|`|4663873fae288f697d0782005be07c6caa	ACID REFLUX?    you mean MENTIONING?

51HWwSlwaa	Short term memory is just what it's called, short term. We do things automatically without think about it. Because it's automatically we don't remember some things, like dinner, brushing your teeth, dressing we just do it. As far as remembering your name now that is a problem. What is going on in your life for the lack of concretion? Sometimes i have so much going on i can't remember what i was doing and at times i forget my name. NO i don't think i am crazy just to busy and to much to concentrate on everyday chores i do automatically. Chill out a little, sounds like you have to much going on right now. Just slow down a little, don't let things make you feel crazy and get stressed out.<br>  JUST SLOW DOWN AND CHILL OUT A LITTLE!!|`|eKeWnkguaa	i always forget stuff lol its normal for teenagers because we have other things on are mind|`|fZ3FXZMyaa	sure short term memory loss is very common in teenagers <br>     its called  you have no more brain cells<br>            stop smokin weeds
qkblT2hgaa	Check out www.menshealth.com or pick up one of the magazines. They have great exercises that will work for both men and women. As far as diet plans go, I can only recommend that you eat a lot of vegetables. Here is one tip that really works. Eat an apple about 15 minutes before you have lunch and dinner. It will suppress your appetite and cause you eat less at lunch and dinner. If you get hungry before bed. Eat a handful of carrots. No "white after night". This means no potatoes, pasta, rice or breads after 7PM.<br>  <br>  Lastly, if you still can't shed the pounds, go on a Disney Cruise or just go to Disney World for your vacation. It won't matter how fat you think you are, there are many people there that actually are fat.|`|8WPpcjhCaa	Pilates!  Omgosh it's the best, it really targets exactly what you want!

Make sure you get a lot of fruits and vegetables and try to keep fats and sugars to a minimum. You can try running long distances to tone your lower body and add in some ab workouts. There are tons of things to do for your abs that you could find online. Leg lifts are probably a good thing to start with.

c41f417a3060cfc6a7f3b78b167af409aa	The diagnostic criteria for a panic attack in the DSM-IV-TR (the most recent version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) are as follows:<br>  <br>  At least 4 of the 13 symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: <br>  -sweating<br>  -trembling/shaking<br>  -tingling/numbness<br>  -chills/hot flushes<br>  -derealization/depersonalization<br>  -fear of dying<br>  -fear of losing control<br>  -palpatations/accelerated heart rate<br>  -abdominal discomfort/nausea<br>  -feelings of choking<br>  -shortness of breath<br>  -dizzy/lightheaded<br>  -chest pain/discomfort<br>  <br>  you only mentioned sweating and heart racing in your description, but that doesn't mean you weren't having a panic attack.  HOWEVER, it doesn't sound like a "panic attack" to me, just overwhelmed by stress.  They aren't really the same thing.  A panic attack more often comes about abruptly and out of context...what you are experiencing is directly linked to your schedule.  If all of this causes impairment, however, you can still seek couseling for stress management.  Good luck and I hope things improve for you.|`|jtAnsl0taa	YES it sounds like a panic attack.  It's really simple to tell the dr though what's going on.  I used to get them frequently, but after talking with my dr (who prescribed a very low dose xanax) and learning the triggers, it doesn't happen much anymore. <br>  See your dr, talk to him/her about what's bothering you and see if that med can help you.  By the way, I no longer take it.  It was not something that caused me to get "hooked" or have to wean off of.  You feel an attack coming on, take the med and learn to work/exercise/talk out the problem that's triggering it.  <br>  GOOD LUCK|`|AA10908884	have a hot drink and don't  do anything that needs a lot of thinking about from 8-00pm then when you go to bed put on a Radio it will clear your mind of daily things good luck|`|9YAP6MmUaa	hard to say - but you def seem over stressed- you should talk to someone - better out than in|`|F8tQkDPcaa	Here's some good information for you to know (extracted from this site): www.panic-away.tk<br>  <br>  <br>  "This Is The Key To Being Panic Attack Free...<br>  <br>  You Must Learn To Break The Fear Of Having Another Panic Attack Or You Will Never Experience Complete Freedom From Anxiety <br>  <br>  <br>  -The anticipation of a panic attack starts the wave cycle of anxiety in motion. <br>  <br>  -The foundation of a future panic attack is laid hours before you actually experience one.<br>  <br>  -The slightest stress trigger will then launch the full blown panic attack into motion. <br>  <br>  -Panic manifests itself in approximately 20 minute wave like formations. <br>  <br>  <br>  This Is Where Your Problem Lies <br>  <br>  There is one key factor that makes the difference between those who fully eliminate panic attacks from their lives and those who do not. The key ingredient is not medication, lifestyle changes, or relaxation exercises. It is when the individual no longer fears the thought of having a panic attack. <br>  <br>  This may seem like a simplified and obvious observation but give it careful consideration. The one thing that has you searching for a solution to anxiety and panic attacks this very moment is the fear of having another one.<br>  <br>  The first time a person experiences a panic attack it can feel like their world is falling down around them. Nowhere feels safe as the anxiety becomes like a stalker lurking in the background. <br>  <br>  When this happens people begin to either avoid situations that make them anxious or they medicate themselves to the point where they are numb to the fear.

Once that is established, they'll contact the coroner (or assistant coroner), who will come out and officially declare the person dead.  The coroner will determine if the death is in any way suspicious (the body will be sent for autopsy if they do).  Then they'll either take the body for autopsy, or ask you (or the closest relative) which funeral home you want to use.

I felt silly after for crying because it wasn't that bad.It was actually kind of interesting, and I didn't feel a thing.

A root canal is usually performed when the tooth cannot be filled or restored any other way because the decay has reached the nerve of the tooth or the tooth has become infected.

AA11409272	Hate to say it...and havent tried it...but many people swear by earwax. Look it up.
AA11303945	It's an alternative to traditional medicines.  Most pain meds are rough on the stomach lining, and if your stomach ailments include diarrhea, any oral meds you take may be eliminated before they can be absorbed.    As a rule, doctors won't prescribe narcotics to anyone with an addiction problem (past or present) or who exhibits drug-seeking behavior.  Evidently, the doctor believes that marijuana therapy can help you deal more effectively with your medical problems.  It is important to remember that it is not a cure, but a coping mechanism, and maybe if it can keep your stomach from rebelling, it can begin to heal and you'll be able to take medications that can help resolve your problems.      Talk more to your doctor and make sure you understand what marijuana can and cannot do.  And, just because marijuana is used as a recreational drug and is generally illegal in the U.S. does not mean that using it for medical relief is a bad or immoral thing to do.  The decision to use it, or not, is between you and your doctor.      Hydrocodone painkillers are massively abused by drug users, but if your doctor prescribed vicodan for your pain, you probably wouldn't hesitate to use it because it was developed for medical uses first, nor would you consider your religion or family in the decision to take it.  Just because the intoxicating qualities of marijuana were discovered before the pallative qualities does not make it a less effective medication.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	It depends on how much u like pain,are u a sado masochist.Most pharmaceuticals come from plants,marijuana is a plant ,god made the plants.You're Dr.prescribed it for u because he/she thinks it will help.Jesus turned water into wine not the other way around.Is you're family the one feeling the pain?Take the medicine Duhhh..!!!!.|`|f9No4eRBaa	There are other types of medicine from drugs to holistic where you don't have to breath that s-h-i-t- in.  If you were diagnosed with 3 to 6 months to live and in a lot of pain, that would be different.  You have to weigh the benefits of what the marijuana will do to your lungs vis-a-vis help your existing pain. Also, if you are taking Xanax (an anti-depressant), it could conflict and give you a not so nice personality change.    My advise is not to take it . .. go for something else and then if it is absolutely the last thing left and you are in unbearable pain, then consider it.|`|exMPHWKHaa	Why wouldn't you take it? You suffer from pain and were prescribed a medicine.. I am catholic and smoke marijuana all the time there is nothing in the bible against marijuana... God made it and put it on this earth it is just a medicine your doctor prescribed to you.|`|CZ1nO9C9aa	Just because it is illegal non-medicinally doesn't mean it goes against Christ's teachings.  The only reason it was made illegal in the first place anyway was because of racism, propaganda, and industrial competition in the mid to late 1930s.  Christ never said anything about obeying the laws of the land.  What if there was a dictator who said you need to have sex with your sister and worship wooden statues.  Those would be the laws of the land ... and Christ obviously wouldn't want you to follow them.    If you are afraid of what your family will think, then you can cook it into food so that you don't have to smoke it .... that is if your doc prescribes enough, since smoking uses less weed.|`|tL5vlITcaa	Yes.

2X5bzRXyaa	I wear both contacts and glasses. Contacts during the day and glasses in the night. I do this because when I wear my contacts for a long time, my eyes start to get itchy. Because you're getting reading glasses, you wouldn't need them that often. My friend has the same problem and whenever she can't read something, she just pulls out the glasses.

Maybe if you try that you will become more hungry.  Either way, you are obviously not eating enough... i can understand what you mean, but you are still going to have to force yourself to eat more.|`|XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about.  The main thing is to stick in there.  You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off.  I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://starturl.com/efblc" rel="nofollow">http://starturl.com/efblc</a> along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.|`|5xw8NLEBaa	Targetted weight loss is quite difficult, some would say impossible, however the only method which definitely delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box below, they have a handful of free trials left, it has been highlighted in Reader's Digest and CNN.

B12E4rYiaa	I was a member of the Y for many years. At mine they had an instructor who showed you how and what was going on. They also had step classes and other types of classes.

Br3hJfDCaa	I use to do cycling classes at the gym (now I just cycle outdoors).<br>  <br>  If it's your first time, arrive at the class a few minutes early & have a chat with the instructer. They'll give you a basic idea of how their classes work & on how to set up the bike to fit you comfortably.<br>  <br>  Most classes last about 45mins. Each bike has a dial on it - the higher it goes, the more hard it is to pedal.<br>  Most classes include a warmup ride, spinning (pedaling really fast on a low intensity), a hill climb (slower pedaling on a higher intensity either sitting or and standing on the pedals), intervals (with a mixture of spinning & an easier pace for recovery) & then a warm down & a stretch.<br>  <br>  It's set to music with music tracks matched to the intensity of the pedaling. <br>  You are going to sweat, so bring a bottle of water & a towel to wipe down the bike afterwards.<br>  <br>  I will warn you though, the first time is not going to be easy for you, and the next day you will proberly have sore & stiff muscles.<br>  So take it easy the first day & only turn the intensity dial as high as you feel is appropiate.<br>  <br>  It becomes a bit more easier on your muscles over tme, so keep at it for awhile & it'll become more fun (but perhaps not as much as outdoor cycling).<br>  <br>  Clothes - stiff soled sneakers, leggings & a baggy teeshirt will suffice. But I'd perhaps go for more synthetic materials, because cotton get clingy when sweaty. <br>  <br>  It's a really good cardio workout & it strengthens the legs & bum muscles (and the core muscles to a small degree). <br>  All that cardio will help expose any ab muscles you have, but you're have do a few situps to build up those muscles.<br>  <br>  Happy riding.|`|tIldpr7vaa	spin classes r great for losing weight|`|4WVbjbWxaa	yes cycling is awesome as it works on your leg musceles ....<br>  <br>  also try to ask ur instructor abt diets ... <br>  <br>  i think to lose weight  Vegetables and fruits are your best friends.

1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	This is not a "problem."     I am a handwriting expert. I can tell you that among adults, that most of them do not have a "decided" handwriting style that remains constant. The biggest factor that changes handwriting is MOOD. If you are the type of person whose mood changes rapidly, or who has an emotional streak, making most of your decisions based on how you "feel" rather than how you "reason," then your handwriting will reflect these changes, oftentimes from moment to moment!  There is nothing wrong with this. It's just a reflection of what is going on inside your head and with your feelings.    The more you try to force your handwriting to conform to a pre-conceived notion of what it "should" be, the more noticeable the changes will be...so stop trying!  You should just be yourself and let your handwriting be what it wants to be. Anything else is phony.   Also, 99% of the population are not handwriting experts or analysts, so who really cares besides you?    Additional info: if your slant changes, that means you are very easily influenced by your surroundings--sometimes embracing the social behavior around you and conforming to it, other times rejecting it and doing your own thing. There's nothing "wrong" with either attitude. It's just what you feel at the time.  If your pressure changesj--the actual pressure you use on the paper--then your emotions are fluctuating. Heavier pressure means more deep-seated emotional involvement. If your writing SIZE changes then you differ in how you treat things intellectually. Smaller size means you're more likely to think "inside your head" than to figure things out by discussion or talking with others.     If your letter forms change, that's completely utterly NORMAL. EVERYONE'S letter forms change, sometimes drastically; it really depends on what you're writing! If you're emotionally involved with what it is you're trying to say, then your letters may change to reflect that.     The fact that you're concerned about the way your writing looks, even when you are writing something for your eyes only, shows that you're very concerned with how people perceive you. This is not necessarily a good thing--you should be more confident about who you are and what you think without worrying so much about others. A handwriting "style" is not really a "style" at all--it's a reflection of your inner self. If you're a volatile, emotional person, your writing will reflect it, no matter how you think you're being perceived.|`|UIT1khqtaa	it's okay, really. juz make sure that ppl can read it clearly.  i'm havin' the same problem, but it's not that my handwriting is changing, it's the size of my handwriting. really it's getting smaller every new term. and lol, my teacher got so mad bout it. but i teach her for good, i told her ''who cares really! at least u can SEE it clearly that it's so SMALL! why makin' a stupid damn fuss bout it then?!''    ahah. i luv my own guts. juz luv ur own handwriting the way it is, no matter if it's constantly changing.

YlLdIPRvaa	All of the above.  Everyone is different and reacts to sitautions differently.  Some people may become depressed becuase they can't live up to the person they want or need to be.  Some people will try even harder.  Some people will abandon their values if it becomes too hard.  I would encourage people to keep trying.  And remind them that nothing is out reach.|`|tmL3zyVyaa	Depressed.|`|5j1Uhg2Gaa	It depends on the values and the person. Some people when they are younger have a different set of values than when they get older. Just because they change doesn't mean you get depressed. You can almost control anything that is going on inside you body with your brain. If you constantly think about being depressed than you will become depressed. However, if you become active and be around people that make "you" feel good and not think about depression, you will not be depressed.|`|0e9846c69a3447404194ba8083d4f969aa	I would assume they would be depressed since their ideal life and current life are incongruent.     Of course, your values may change naturally.
2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	The best bet to remove something from the eye surface is to flush the eye with cool or lukewarm water and keep flushing the eye.  You can use a shotglass and fill with filtered or previously boiled water that has cooled to room temperature - make absolutely sure the glass is clean, wash and rinse before using!!!!!  Place the glass up against your cheek and put over the eye leaving your eye open - make sure to move the eye back and forth and up and down.  Do this multiple times and see if that doesn't help.  You can also get an eyewash or use contact lens saline solution and rinse the eye out.  If that still doesn't help you may need to get medical attention.
bribxhsdaa	I like your glasses. >_>.    I don't think they are. I think if you have piercings that could cause you injury i.e. Big jangly hoop earrings, Thats cause for a self injury...|`|n7bok7NRaa	Self-Injurers are of one of two types. One - they are those who feel pain and pleasure as strongly interconnected, and thus, often indulge in painful acts to feel good. Two - they are those who are so nervous and depressed that the act of self injury brings a calming sort of feeling (caused by the endorphin rush as well as the sense of control 'I can do this, and no one can stop me'.)    People who enjoy tattoos and piercings because they love the way they look are not endangering themselves, and are not self-injurers necessarily.    Some might argue that those who enjoy pain (not those who helplessly cut themselves due to anxiety) are still not 'crazy', they're just wired differently.    Now if this is a guardian or parent who is telling you that story, they're likely just trying to control your situation by telling you something that is basely not true in order to scare you into conforming.    But here's the real kicker - if you're underage and living in their house, you'll have to put up with it until you can move out and become independent. Otherwise, you know what they'll get up to - calling in doctors and psychiatrists or sending you to Bible Camp to get your demons out - when you just think body art is really pretty.    If you're still a young one, just wait it out, and decorate your body later when no one is stopping you.

I even burn calories for doing this.|`|lWwy6W4Aaa	I think the efficiency of your dancing is directly porpotional to your actual fitness. Dancing is definately a great way to do cardiovascular excercise, but for results that you can actually see, try using light weights, and resistance as you dance. Cardiovascular alone, is not the most efficient way to "tone" your body, if combined with weight training and resistance work outs you could definately see some great results in weeks.|`|ekpg6v1Kaa	It could do but i don't know that so i guess keep on dancing and if it works like you said then good on you anyway.

CkdSTD1Baa	ugh I totally feel your pain! (literally lol) I have the exact same problem. I've never found sex pleasurable! It just hurts! and sometimes it only hurts at the beginning (like just insertion) and then it just feels kinda neutral, and other times it hurts the whole time. But it never feels good! <br>  <br>  I thought it was literally just me until one day I was talking to one of my best friends, and she told me she had the same problem. The doctor says the same thing to me, and like you said, it doesnt help. <br>  <br>  But she also told me that it could be psychological. Sex is much more than just he physical for women, and if your whole heart and soul isn't into it, you're gunna have problems. I know that sounds silly, but its true. She told me that if somewhere in the back of your head you are nervous, of you dont want to have sex, or anything like that, your vaginal wall muscles will actually tense up during sex and make it painful. Its sort of your body's way of telling you to stop. <br>  <br>  So, if this is your problem, which it very well could be (even if you dont think it is!), you just need to do some soul searching. Figure out if you are totally happy with your partner, and if you are, then try to get as relaxed as you possibly can before you have sex. Have your partner help you relax. (remember, foreplay is your friend!) And do it when you feel you are really really ready. And most importantly, dont think to yourself RELAX RELAX RELAX! Because taht will just stress you out! Just let it be. <br>  <br>  If all else fails, and you are still really frustrated, you should go to your doctor (or a new doctor) and really explain to him/her the situation, and how frustrated you are. Tell them that you have tried everything, and you feel like there is a problem.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wRow3wC1aa	the exact same thing is going on with my g/f.  ask ur doctor about endemetriosis.  its a thinning of the walls.   we just went to her obygn two days ago.  it never hurts to ask.<br>  <br>  <br>  best of luck i some what know what ur goin through|`|X2FrjG8Laa	well it suppose to feel good but i think that they dont turn you on enough so it wont hurt or you are just not into sex its ok if your not but try to relax when your doing it|`|ScoATvBiaa	Is it maybe because of the size of your partners or partner|`|OpduZC3Eaa	Perhaps you have a short cervix or vagina? I know that sometimes women experience a lot of physical pain during sex because of this issue. Other than that I can only say to do your research!|`|44BEm1Uhaa	You should try some of the guys here that complain about having a 3" tool,you may just be built for one of them.|`|AA10719818	Few questions:<br>  Do you have painful periods? Lots of cramping?<br>  <br>  Ever have any lower back pain?<br>  <br>  It could be endometriosis.  Endometriosis will not be found in a pap smear.  Look up the symptoms of it and see if it fits.  It can cause sex to be quite painful.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hope it all works out for you soon!<br>  <br>  EDIT: endometriosis is NOT a thinning of the walls.  Endometriosis happens when your endometrial tissue grows outside of the uterus.|`|muHctmaGaa	Are you able to orgasm through other acts like oral sex and clitoral stimulation? If not, it's probably psychological. If so, you need to find a second opinion from a different doctor. Read some Betty Dodson, buy yourself a dildo, and get comfortable with penetration on your own before you bring partners back into it. It'll give you better insight.|`|1BbnyTfBaa	If you still have pain when you use lube, my guess (I'm not a doctor!) would be that it's psychological.  There is a lot on the Internet about this:<br>  <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=painful+intercourse" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com/search?q=painful+i...</a>|`|ubofHDxPaa	Should not be so painfull.

wdNfee9Baa	Swimming is probably the best thing you can do to tone and firm those specific areas of your body as well as others.  About 60 mins of constant swimming about 3 or 4 times a week will show amazing results just in a few short weeks.     If your not really into swimming or don't have access to a pool you can do squats to firm up your butt and thighs as well as lunges with 5-10 pound weights in each hand.    To firm up your arms simple bicep curls and tricep curls will do the trick.  Since you did not specify which part of your arm I can't give you anymore specific exercises other than possibly push ups.    Push ups will also help strengthen your chest so I would suggest doing 25 reps 8 times for a total of 200 push ups.  (if that is too hard start with only doing 100).    Cardio of any kind can really tone and firm other parts of your body so try to incorporate that into your exercise routine.  Even 30 mins 3 times a week will help and build your stamina.    Good Luck :)|`|jlrb0ZXoaa	for butt and thighs, do 100 jumping jacks to get warmed up, then do squat thrusts and lunges.|`|1fhXox34aa	rowing machine does all them  swimmin also good|`|zXtXeEBBaa	Do squats twice a day|`|OUiWjH7Gaa	lunges.|`|W7l1awFPaa	Pilates.
L2NLOWYGaa	see, firstly,this transient rise of blood pressure is not always a cause to worry but yes if it becomes frequent...secondly, he is on anti-hypertension medication and he is regular on it so try to find out the triggering factors that cause abrupt increase in pressure. these factors can range from anxiety, mental tension to certain food and beverages..  to prevent these from recurring you should check your BP twice daily and avoid those triggering factors plus regular light to moderate exercises,brisk walking, yoga and eat healthy food,avoid spicy,salty and oily food.. if it is persistently high then there must be some metabolic causes then you have to go for thorough check up with cardiac and renal functions evaluation..so here is the final advise, a person with high BP can live 100% normal life with regular medication and healthy life style..stay green stay healthy..|`|a893b2d2332387b71e69d418087c9c7eaa	You need to take him to the ER.

aWdAZOpJaa	I used to have discharge at your age too. Except I have had my period by then and it was just a mere case of Yeast Infection. It depends on what the discharge is like. It can be irritation. But it can also be the fluid that cleanses your .. private area. Its pretty much normal, as long as it isn't itchy or painful or disgusting smelling. You're at that age now anyway, girls will get this way before/after their period. You'll realize after you get your period that there'll be many many many times when that area "down there" will smell different sometimes, have discharge, and will always require cleaning. Its sensitive and needs to be handled sensitively.|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Yes it's normal..<br>  .<br>  Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to you than to others. <br>  <br>  You can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period. It will also continue after you get your period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you. <br>  .<br>  Different Types of Discharge:<br>  <br>  White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.<br>  <br>  Different types of infections:<br>  <br>  Signs of yeast infections:<br>  White, cottage cheese-like discharge <br>  Swelling and pain around the vulva <br>  Intense itching <br>  <br>  Signs of bacterial vaginosis:<br>  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge <br>  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap <br>  Itching or burning <br>  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva <br>  <br>  Signs of trichomoniasis<br>  A watery, yellowish or greenish bubbly discharge <br>  An unpleasant odor <br>  Pain and itching when urinating <br>  Most apparent after your period|`|1lTcxYWhaa	sorry to dissappoint you girls, but discharge will continue pretty much until menopause. No one talks about it, but its completely normal and can be used to identify your fertility. It will change in consistency throughout your cycles becoming more clear and slippery when your ovulating to a thick white clumpy paste when you are not fertile. It helps to get used to it and understand that if you don't want kids... dont have sex when your discharge is slippery!! Just think, "can sperm swim through this stuff?". Before your period starts, it is likely that its pretty thick and white, right? Just means you are not fertile right now.<br>  <br>  also- if you are very athletic, it can REPLACE your periods.|`|rtQi0SSraa	yep it is normal. although every girl is different. i am sure you have nothing to worry about ^_^ <br>  But since you do have some concerns about it then I would get ahold of a OBGYN and get an apointment and get checked out.|`|eb9n9yhcaa	the same thing happened to me. i am only 12 tho (13 in april) i got discharge for like 5 months then my period. i asked a question on here earlier about the same thing and i remember one answer said you can have discharge up to 2 years b4 ur period. just be sure to tell your mom. i'm sure she knows better than anyone on the internet. good luck!|`|zDJVWlscaa	Have you started your periods yet?<br>  If not, you'll be getting them soon.

4E07Ejkiaa	If your body is sexually mature enough for you to have your period, it can handle using a tampon. It really is just a matter of personal preference. I started using them when I was about 14. I prefer tampons because they feel cleaner, are less bulky than pads, don't smell bad, and there is a smaller chance of leaks. I know a few ladies at my work who still use pads and they are in their 30s and 40s.|`|kbz5S3waaa	I did, I don't like the way a pad feels - I'm 21 now btw and i'm perfectly fine, just don't forget to change it :)|`|Dkg7sqxIaa	i don't lol :P|`|jrc7V1Gqaa	Stop comparing yourself to everyone else If tou feel good in using tampons then us them.|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	i use pads, but that's just me (i'm 15)    use tampons if you like|`|tGcNmDUZaa	I have just turned 14. when I was 13 I did wear tampons.

d62c067621221ba2fcf278583e7f2288aa	I believe that taking fish oil supplements contains more omega-3 since you are more than likely cooking the fish in question which could eliminate some of the omega-3. While fish obviously does contain Omega 3, it is more than likely not as concentrated as the supplement. Flax seed oil actually contains more Omega 3 than Fish oil so that could actually be a replacement for your fish oil.|`|zSkC7hsGaa	yes|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Yes it works exactly the same<br>  <br>  <a href="http:///www.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http:///www.charleslloydfitness.com</a><br>  <a href="http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com" rel="nofollow">http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com</a>|`|5rJ6nf2oaa	You'd probably have to eat quite a lot of fish to obtain the same amount of oil found in capsules, especially if you are on medium to high doses.<br>  <br>  The one thing I will say in defence of fresh fish is that the oils are fresh and more beneficial to the body. Oils in capsules and bottles will deteriorate on storage so capsules are better than bottled oils since the air can't get to them.<br>  <br>  If you combine capsules with some fresh fish every week then you are getting the best possible intake. ie Quantity plus quality.

As a fellow human, I would suggest you ask for something other than Trazodone because the effects are way too persistent to ignore.|`|b0ItZsXZaa	i was on trazodone for awhile it dose fade after awhile but with the nausea fading the effect of the drug fade as well.

UZJ7wVc8aa	If you want to lose weight, you need to two things: eat less and exercise more. Weight gain happens when you create a calorie surplus (eat more than you burn). Your body takes the excess calories and converts them to fat which get stored around your stomach, arms and thighs. The longer you remain in a calorie surplus, the more weight you'll gain. To lose that weight, you need to do the opposite. You need to create a calorie deficit (start eating less than you burn). <br>  <br>  Your first step is to figure out how many calories you burn on a daily basis. This calculator will help you out <a href="http://calorieneedscalculator.com" rel="nofollow">http://calorieneedscalculator.com</a> The number you get from this tool is what your body burns on a daily basis. To lose weight, simply eat less. It sounds a lot easier than it is but making small changes helps you adjust to a new lifestyle. Don't think of this as a diet, think of it as a new life. Instead of eating foods high in sugars, white flour and saturated fat, go with fruits, vegetables, whole wheats, fish, lean meats, nuts and beans. In addition to eating less, you also need to exercise more. Start off at 1-2 times per week and work your way up to 3-5 times per week.<br>  <br>  Don't make all of these changes at once or you won't be able to properly adjust to them. Generally, eating healthier foods will decrease your calorie intake. Compare a doughnut to an apple and you'll see that healthy foods are lower in calories.

They can be just some brown spotting or last for 3-10 days depending on the person.  Some girls even miss a few months until their hormones develop.

Your at the age that males are starting to become men. Some do it sooner than others. So just because you don't see your friends with hair like your doesn't mean that they wont have it soon. As far as your parent's they are adults and went through changes as your age as well. I know that when my son changes like that I wouldn't think any differently about him. They knew that this was going to happen. They still see you as their little boy. Its a natural thing to happen. Nothing to be shy about. The good thing about hair is that you can cut it and shave it too. So when you get older if you decide you don't like it then you can just trim it or shave it. My husband has hair on his chest and it doesn't bother me at all!

CqLjZfkLaa	You might be pushing yourself too hard. Back off the intensity a couple of notches, especially if you are new to working out.  Also be sure you are properly hydrated.  Try to stay away from sodas and sports drinks, and stick with plain water.  If that doesn't help, quit working out until you talk to a doctor.|`|Rlm7VjeEaa	Because you worked out and you're tired. Also, your brain is getting a rush of blood since it doesn't have to keep pumping blood (which has oxygen in it) to your muscles. Try eating or drinking something and sitting for a while.|`|RbmVnoozaa	it happens to everybody after an intense work out.<br>  sometimes i feel really drunk after i run.<br>  <br>  just wait til your heart rate goes down and then sit down and relax.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Your circulation is upped, blood rushing all over your body.|`|7y8OUFFYaa	Cause something is missing there.|`|Kg9H5ROcaa	drink sum gatorade sucka|`|GFHRpDE4aa	i have the same thing, it's when you have bad circulation through your body, and the blood is getting to your brain faster than normal, so it makes you kinda confused and your head fells wierd, just try to drink enough water and don't over due it.<br>  It's called a (head rush)<br>  <br>  hope i helped  :]|`|uiDJlhy5aa	You need carbs! Stat!<br>  You need to consume enough carbs before a workout (to keep you going; it's like energy storage) and after (so your body can re-energize itself).|`|fTJMI05oaa	Do you breathe?Are you exhaling and inhaling effectivity on reps?Concentrate on that.|`|V5W8jE5Yaa	cause you just got done working up a sweat....<br>  drink some water and eat a fruit or something healthy
pUIGCtaZaa	Yes, that is definitely a form of a panic attack.|`|ANsznbWsaa	Anxiety and panic attacks are the same thing|`|qfs1OCL3aa	panic attack. But if afterward you have a headache, sensitive to light and sound, you might be suffering from migraines.
1rTm4p75aa	I'm exactly the same right now - I'm just keeping warm (plenty of layers on) - Drinking plenty of water - Eating hot food (although have avoided the chicken soup thus far!) - And I have a packet of Lockets to temporarily ease the congestion.    Sounds like you're at the same stage as me - and I don't expect to have this when I wake-up Thursday morning.    :-)|`|xfpJGBfwaa	The best advice i ever heard came from the Asians:  fresh ginger.  Slice some up, and soak it in your hot tea, then eat it.  No kidding.  It will make you break out in a sweat, and your cold will be much better.  Just keep it up until the cold is gone.      Also, if you're not taking a multivitamin/multimineral, then start now, and it will help your cold.  Just don't take megadoses right away.  Ramp up, or you'll create more stress in your body instead of less.    When you get over it, get your flu shot, and your pneumonia shot.  Remember to get your flu shot every year.  You only need the pneumonia shot every 10 years.  Pay out of pocket if you have to.  They're not expensive, like $50-70 where I am.   Worth it when you compare it to the cost of cold medicine and lost work hours.|`|MOPXWu33aa	Boil an inch of ginger cut up in pieces,three cloves,three pepper corns,  an inch of cinnamon and two garlic cloves in a glass of water. After one  boil, close the gas and keep it covered for five minutes.Then strain and  drink it warm.  In a pan,heat sea salt and put it on a square cheese cloth and make a  bundle and tie it with a thread.Foment your chest with this bundle.If you make two bundles,when one bundle cools, you can take the second one. Be careful not to burn yourself.Test it on your hand before  putting it on your chest.If available, ajwain seeds (wild celery seeds)  can be added to the salt.Then keep yourself warm for a couple of hours.|`|BNAzjSO1aa	Try to keep warm take in plenty of fluids and eat lots of fruit which is rich in vitamin C as this is supposed to help recover from colds. If you are not going to drink alcohol at the formal then you could cheat and take a cold or flu remedy before you go to mask the symptoms, but normally it is better to let the cold run it's course|`|6xHOa3tJaa	stay in bed  sleep is the way to recover  cold  pills drink water and orange juice and eat some chicken noodle soup  and hot tea|`|441GSyaMaa	Stay in bed, keep very warm. Drink lots of water and eat healthy.     and take cold pills, they always really help.
iE40WHlhaa	http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4JMOh-cul...|`|dcsAFr5uaa	If you are wanting to be strong but hide it you should workout regularly with light weights. If you want rippling muscles, workout not as regular with heavy weights. Other than that, drink plenty of water and get lots sun tan.|`|cOJyoXEhaa	Exercise and diet. Most of all start a routine and stay with it. Everyone wants the body, but do not want the work. Drink lots of water, cram proteins and remember your vitamins. Make shure you do cardio with your weight training. I was 5'10" and weighed 115 as a senior. I am now 6'00" and am 165 it was hard but you can do it, I know what you are going through. Hang in you can do it.|`|PCpC4iS1aa	go to the gym an work out or lift wights|`|8UHWm3j4aa	ummm mental health?  you can lift weights alot and that sort of stuff
ndlGyX0Waa	YES YOU CAN STILL KEEP GROWING UP TILL 20, YOU ALSO CAN MAKE EXERCISES....    BYE!!!|`|ev353FQMaa	Yeah. You've got a few years til you stop growing.|`|IvfEtJi8aa	its possible... especially if there are tall people in your family. if your family has mainly short people, then it is likely not. also, if you matured faster than other guys, it's very likely you are done growing.    I had a friend that was about 5'3' for most of his life, until he was 17/18. now he's about 6'.|`|AA11584049	you may grow slightly but there is no way your growing to grow 5 inches sorry to burst your bubble but your 18 years old youve most likely already had your growth spurt|`|Y0p1LDTDaa	guys have the potential of growing until about 26, so cross your fingers|`|ZBSlbzYtaa	highly unlikely..... unless you grow an afro
ReHd1IlYaa	I think you being scared about going is related to your lingering past memories, which is what you want to fix in the first place.    I mean, my first set answer is GO.  You know you need to, and this could change your life.  Just a little fyi though if you start and feel its not working for you, change therapists and just do what you need to do to fix what you feel is wrong.    I'm sorry to hear all that happened to you but just hold onto hope and the light at the end of the tunnel! Winter always turns to spring.
KGf1hUzhaa	First off if the medicine isn't working your doctor needs to be aware of this so he can help adjust your treament to best suit you.    One way to strengthen the external sphincter muscle (the voluntary musle that lets you hold it) is while you are urinating stop your stream and hold it, do this several times every time you urinate and you should help strengthen that muscle.      If, however, this is not a muscular problem this is a problem best addressed by your doctor.|`|UcgWrGaAaa	If it is just a little you should wear period pads and then you can change it when you need to and your clothes won't get soiled and you can control the smell.      You can get some cloth pads that you just throw in the washer if you google cloth menstrual pads or go on ebay, they have a lot of pretty things that can help you cheer up.  You could put a drop of essential oil on it to help with smells.    Sounds like a tough problem.  Sorry you're going through this.  I don't really have any answers for your real question.|`|ljWqn7Zhaa	maybe you have a really weak bladder (like me)    but i'm not sure what to suggest for it though, maybe ask your doctor again?    sorry i wasnt much help :(|`|FouexPY3aa	First off, go to the bathroom frequently. So your bladder will be empty. Make sure you don't wear tight clothes around your bladder area so it doesn't squeeze on it. Also, don't drink a lot of liquids because that'll make you have to go to the bathroom. If you're worried about the smell, get perfume, or lotion, and put it on whenever you notice. People are most likely not going to notice you did anything if they smell perfume.|`|IAgYpkQHaa	I grew up always having bladder infections which kinda lead to me having a weak bladder. Therefore I was unable to stop myself from letting a little pee out once in a while. So I always smelt bad.     I would say talk to your doctor again or maybe try to go to a different doctor to get a second opinion.|`|qKA05EQTaa	http://healthy-lifestyle.most-effective-...    try printing this artical out and showing your doctor. maybee it will help in treatment.    here are also some home remedies / worth a try     http://www.earthclinic.com/Pets/incontin...    incontinence is the technical term for this problem    good luck and god bless|`|0ec432c1a1f65261d332f88dd1a027bcaa	you may have a prolapsed bladder anyway there are surgeries that cure several things but being so young it probably isn't something too serious that's why your dr. thinks it's an infection. in the mean time till they figure out the reason. try wearing one of those scented sanitary pads like always the heavier flow days that way you can throw out the wet pad and get rid of the smell. also wet a napkin and give a quick wash then put on a new pad.
ItJzrvQ4aa	When  you are losing  weight,  you should exercise and diet  together.<br>  If  you exercise without dieting, you will get bigger appetite,  which<br>  will  lead  to  increase  of  weight, or muscle grow<br>  underneath  the  fat  layer, and make you bulkier. If you diet without<br>  exercising,  you  will  become  flabby  and will have excess skin. For<br>  diet,  go  wheat  free.  No pasta, pizza, bread and so on. And no food<br>  after  7  p.m. People achieve marvellous results with it. Depending on<br>  your  initial  weight, you can drop upwards from 20 pounds a month. If<br>  you  don't  eat  wheat then you don't eat all those sticky, fatty goey<br>  cakes,  you  don't eat junk food, and you don't eat biscuits. But your<br>  diet  is  still  balanced.  It  costs  nothing, and you do not have to<br>  calculate  points  or  to  buy special meals or plans. For exercising,<br>  start with walking, and then switch to running/jogging. Running is the<br>  most efficient and calorie-burn exercise ever. If you are overweight a<br>  lot,  walk  first  or you may have health complications (heart attack,<br>  disjointed  bones and so on). Weight lifting is a good means to target<br>  your problem areas for men and women. It's not necessarily to become a<br>  bodybuilder or even join a gym - a couple of dumbbells will help you<br>  to target your problem areas (stomach, butt, legs, arms, chest).|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat|`|TtVacmsoaa	The formula for losing weight is simple - consume less food and workout more often - the difficulties surface when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are lots of temptations in the big wide world don't you think?! The sole diet that clearly showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a few free trials remaining, it has been highlighted in Fox News and CNN. I melted away twenty pounds, it clearly does work!|`|Py0RLtYvaa	Hey<br>  <br>  This should help.<br>  <br>  Many people around the country and around the world need to lose weight. For most, exercise and diet are the two main factors for losing weight. Once you have your exercise routine set, you will then need to work on the quality of your diet. If you use a high protein, low carb diet plan, you can significantly lose the weight and fast. <br>  <br>  What A High Protein, Low Carb Diet Can Do For You<br>  <br>  A high protein, low carb diet can work for your body in a few important ways. First of all, it is important to learn exactly how this type of diet works. There are different degrees of a high protein, low carb diet but the truth of the matter is that increasing your protein and reducing your carb intake will help you to lose weight and get healthier. Some of the high protein, low carb diets are especially designed for those looking to go on a diet, while at the other end of the spectrum there is the high protein, low carb diet for medical conditions such as diabetes. <br>  <br>  The biggest advantage to a high protein, low carb diet is that is restricts your intake of refined carbohydrates. These carbohydrates that are found in such products as white rice, pasta, crackers, sweets, and jellies are the substances that give your body a sugar high. If you reduce refined carbohydrates, you can better control your insulin and blood sugar levels. This is an important concept for everyone, not just diabetics. <br>  <br>  Another benefit of a high protein, low carb diet is the fact that weight loss is easier on this type of diet. If you are restricting some of the worst substances that are put mindlessly into your body, you can get healthier while getting thinner. What you want to watch out for on a high protein, low carb diet is that you should try not to restrict all of your carbohydrates. There are some healthy carbohydrates that your body need that are contained in foods such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains. <br>  <br>  If you are looking for a high protein, low carb diet to aid you in your weight loss goal, you will need to understand that this is only one part of a complete diet plan. You must also figure out a regular exercise routine that will give your body the healthy activity that it needs. The diet will help the weight loss process by restricting unhealthy foods from getting into your body and making weight loss tougher. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck.<br>  <br>  G<br>  <a href="http://HealthDietEdge.com" rel="nofollow">http://HealthDietEdge.com</a>|`|8jIF3Ufsaa	count your calories intake
CHCPnvksaa	You'll be hooked up to an IV. They'll inject you with happy juice first to relax you and make you feel groovy. They put you on the table and give you oxygen and inject the anesthesia via IV, they'll have you count back from 10 and you probably won't make it to 7. While you're out, they'll put a breathing tube down your throat, so I would recommend buying some cough drops before surgery because the tube can be irritating. You come out of the anesthesia almost immediately after surgery and will be groggy.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I had a shot put into the IV, and you just black out peacefully.  For other surgeries I've had the oxygen mask thing, but that didn't make me pass out all the way.  Just doesn't let you feel the pain all the way.|`|ivg0lRUraa	You don't feel anything, one second you're talking, you blink, and then its over. And it all depends on you and your body as to what anesthia they'll use. When they say it'll be over before you know it, true.|`|leneiWBlaa	the Doctor will tell you to count to 10 i promise you by 2 you will be asleep it doesn't hurt you just feel a bit dazed when you wake up|`|6mVpfmR6aa	Like you can not possibly stay awake.  Your breathing will be controlled by the doctors.  They make certain you get the proper air.|`|LJcVUnj1aa	I had the an injection in my hand and tbh i didnt feel too good kind of like a cold water running all through you but you are out in seconds so it doesn't really matter.|`|tL5vlITcaa	It pretty much doesn't feel.|`|sidRlOL9aa	Don't get me wrong, it's a little nerve racking. But they usually have you count to ten or Viceversa. By the time you get to 4, your sleeping. You don't feel a thing. When you wake up, your really drowsy. Depending on the person, you can feel a little woozy when you wake up and nauseated. Nothing to be concerned about. Good Luck|`|8IfePMa3aa	With all of my surgeries they've injected a medication interveiniously and then they put an oxygen mask on. It just feels like you're really tried and need to sleep; medication takes effect so fast the mask is just this fading green streak of color and ... recovery room.|`|xfpJGBfwaa	Never had my appendix out.  But the one time I did have minor surgery, they gave me an IV, then through it, a sedative.  Once that took effect, I was wheeled to another room and then I don't remember any time passing.  The next thing I remember is waking up in yet a different room with lots of nurses all around doing I don't know what (I was in no condition to care for I don't know how long).  I don't remember any pain or any time passing.  That's what's so weird/cool: the time effect.  Apparently an hour passed.|`|RvPuRmqAaa	You don't feel anything. I've had multiple surgeries and I recall them putting the oxygen mask on then explaining that they will administer anesthesia through an IV (not a shot). This more than likely may be the last thing you remember, if you even remember that part at all.     I've even woke up after surgery and asked when they were going to start. LOL    Now what you feel AFTER surgery is a different story and that's what pain medication is for.    Health and wellness to you. Good luck!|`|kGDxGYrxaa	i got the shot. it hurts a bit but it starts workin like rite away so itz not that bad. idk about the appendix but i had the general anastesia and they had to put a tube down my throat, n i didnt kno about it, but i think that was wat hurt the most, the sore throat.     btw the tube is done while ur sleeping   gud luk... if u do get the general ask them if they're going to be putting the tube in your throat|`|R9zrDAkeaa	i had an ivy that ran my anesthesia through  and in short it's almost like you never fell asleep  bc you don't realize it when you drift off and when you wake up  it feels like you never went to sleep or it feels as if you just drifted into a short cat nap : ) amazing really|`|TsE5XhXoaa	no pain if uu have been given anesthesia|`|rVi4Ii9yaa	for surgery like that they will often give you a shot ...and do gas . The shot is often in the butt and burns at first .|`|hrFGKAeraa	for me they used the oxygen mask and had me breath in. i was told to count backwards from 100, but i didn't even make it to 89 lol. it's not painful, you just fall asleep.|`|856345a5a21a61417529f271973ac90baa	I'm not sure what you would get for your specific surgery. But when they put you asleep you feel nothing, you just wake up and realize you were knocked out!|`|ioVIAewjaa	they dont use shots usually. Instead they put it in an IV and you grow tired but at the same time you feel healthy. Your breathing gets really even, kinda like you're working out but falling asleep at the same time.    The oxygen mask is about the same. It was a little scary for me because they hold it down. But it's okay in the end. Oxygen smells and tastes really funny but you fall asleep almost immediately, and you feel very comfortable.    It's all okay, theres absolutely no need to be afraid. Oxygen can't hurt you. And as for the shots... not sure.|`|O71xlcG3aa	It is through an IV and the only thing you will remember is the doctor telling you to count to ten and thats it you are out!  You don't really feel anything except when you wake up it is hard to remember where you are and you will be sluggish for a couple of hours.
4f46a3ab367e69b76b30e6290112ed68aa	A small amount with a diet that is balanced otherwise probably won't make you gain weight. However, read the label on them. How many words are on the ingredient list that you can't pronounce? That's a warning sign that these things must be eaten in moderation. Try baked chips, Guilt Free brand or Flat Earth chips. The tomato and basil flat earth chips ROCK in my opinion!|`|F8EnH6JQaa	FULL OF MSG.....<br>  <br>  Try RICE CRACKERS, you can get them in many chip flavors, and they are found int the Cracker section in the store|`|H2hKVastaa	they are full of salt so i would say they are not good for you, but if you have them once in a while then i would say it is ok to have.  but there are 100 calorie packs out there that you can have or try some unsalted popcorn
4UcHI5voaa	There are operations, but I wouldn't reccomend it unless you really have a good reason for it, and you should talk to a doctor. For example, I know someone who had surgery for something similar because of serious backpains.|`|AA12385489	Wear a supportive bra regularly.  NO need to wear it to bed.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, they will still sag after menopause no matter what you do.|`|AA10988719	first off, you really need a proper fitting bra, no matter your age or the size of your breasts.  I know that JCPenneys use to do bra sizing and such and have experts to help you get the proper fit (maybe look into Macys or Nordstroms -- or other major department store near you.  Besides having a boob job which probably costs a fortune, try exercises to give you some lift  ;)  Also, I heard of an herbal remedy that is massaged into the breasts after you come out of a hot shower.  Let me get ya the links, hold on a sec.<br>  <br>  ok, I am back, yeah, this massage oil is made of natural herbs -- you could have your husband do the massaging for you and you both can reap the benefits of that.  The best exercise, I heard of, if you can believe it is bench pressing -- so go out there and pump some iron.|`|Xa9wiUnXaa	stop wearing a sports bra, only wear them when you are actually participating in the sport. other than that get a real bra. they need the support and if you don't give them that then gravity will work its wonders a lot quicker than normal. also never wear a bra to bed.|`|pTzm38Aqaa	My sister says if you wear a bra when you go to sleep, or the size isn't right than it makes your boob turn out all weird.|`|8Sv6tfQMaa	wear underwire or biofits
3TyrAZwMaa	1) the clitoral orgasm. this orgasm is achieved by touching the clitoris with a hand or an object. also something that vibrates helps to achieve this orgasm. Another main way is by using rushing water. main example- the shower head. if you point the water at your clitoris it feels good. this orgasm feels the best, but is the shortest (5-10 seconds)<br>  <br>  2) vaginal orgasm. this orgasm comes by inserting things into your vagina. (like a hand, toy, pencils etc..) Although this orgasm is a bit more difficult to achieve, it is the more common orgasm while you have sex. this orgasm you feel the contractions of your vagina. it feels like nothing else. lasts (between 7-17 seconds)<br>  <br>  3) Anal orgasm. This orgasm comes by inserting objects into your anus. this is the hardest orgasm to achieve because many women find it either gross, or it doesn't feel good. if you decide to try this one, use something small at first, and work your way up to larger objects. use lots of lubrication, and do not put the object in your vagina after it is in the anus. it may cause a number of diseases. most painful, but the orgasm makes you feel like you can't walk! lasts between 7-10 seconds<br>  <br>  4) G-Spot orgasm. this orgasm is achieved by hitting your G-spot with either a sex toy, or a penis. this is a hard orgasm to have because it is rather hard to find the G-Spot. when you do find the G-spot, and massage it enough, you may "squirt" a clear, odorless and taste less liquid. this is my personal favorite orgasm. lasts between 8-20 seconds<br>  <br>  5) nipple orgasms. this is not quite an orgasm. but if you do fool around with your nipples by pinching them, massaging them, putting a vibrator on them, makes the other orgasm you are having even better<br>  <br>  P.S. all orgasms are fantastic and i recommend trying them all|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Signs: increase in blood pressure and pulse rate; breathing quickens; increase in vaginal lubrication; clitoris becomes erect and exposed; breasts become enlarged, nipples erect; skin flushes, particularly the face and chest; pelvic muscle spasms, causing vaginal contractions and orgasmic sensations. Could be throbbing, tingling, pulsating waves of pleasure.|`|wa2Am5m2aa	honestly..its a very hard feeling to describe.  but when it happens, you'll know!! some are different for girls so its hard to describe it really. id describe it as close as i cud as an intense pleasure that you wish would last longer!!|`|AMyZvgcVaa	Well when something touches your vagina and it feels good your legs might get tight and your vagina will too!! After that your vagina will start throbbing and it feels good (in a way)! It will last between 3-10 sec.! Hope this helps!!|`|jkahgSwgaa	The feeling tends to differ for each woman.<br>  <br>  When I have my orgasm my heart skips a beat and i start tingling in my hands and feet. It's an overall feeling of contentment (satisfaction). Ha, it's hard to describe, it's just a great feeling. =D|`|44BEm1Uhaa	When you scream:"O LORD" without being at Church...You're there.|`|H0mtagXoaa	Hard to describe! you should give your self one, and trust me you will know when you have one. there is no one way it will feel, and each one is different.
5dMw30kMaa	Well I try to exfoliate every shower, like using a back lufa thing or scrubby brush with either antibacterial soap or acne face wash. Nice thing about your back you can scrub a lot harder and use harsher products compared to your face....but don't be to harsh haha. Also if you exercise, change your shirt right after because the sweat turns to bacteria on your shirt and then clogs your back pores. Uhmmm what else?? Uhmm OH make sure to use a fresh towel every couple times you shower. Don't wear your shirts more than once without washing them in between. I've been doing that and the bacnes virtually gone!<br>  <br>  <br>  Hope it works for you :D
tUaAmXvsaa	You are a girl.  You cannot masturbate like a boy.  you don't need to know so don't ask.<br>  <br>  Now go along and have you milk and cookies.|`|E64juLwJaa	Grab his hard penis in one hand and move that hand up and down:till he comes.<br>  And that is the point to do it.<br>  Planets.|`|tdkEpKG3aa	does your mommy know when you're in front of the computer?i bet you're still very young,and you shouldn't be asking questions like this yet.|`|AA10475412	Many ways, go to <a href="http://www.jackinworld.com." rel="nofollow">http://www.jackinworld.com.</a>|`|yq5b1OFCaa	seriously? how old are you if your asking this and truly dont know|`|ehnxg6Utaa	same reason girls do.  it feels good and they like doing it|`|SZdVYrSSaa	Most men masturbate once to three times a day. They use their hands to arouse the penis with a repetitive motion until they finally orgasm. This can be done dry, with lubricants, with mentally prepared sexual fantasy, with pornographic material, alone, with a friend, in private, or in semi-public areas each with varying degrees of pleasure. <br>  <br>  Mostly, this is done by nature. When a boy goes through puberty, he will become aroused often, sometimes without any stimulus at all, and eventually will naturally learn to touch himself to relieve this pressure. By his twenties, he will usually continue to do this out of stress, boredom, sexual repression, or simply habit, and if the male is not currently sexually active with a partner, he will often masturbate for health.

Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging.

dd15228a42b4652d8768334912349b61aa	Sorry I don't like the word skinny ~ not a good idea.    Your body is based on the genes of your parents, you can alter that, by eating properly, and exercise ~ cut out fats, eat fresh food like veg and lean meat [Turkey, chicken, even pork if cooked correctly]    Exercise by walking instead of going by car, bus or train [sounds silly I know if you have to get to school, work or what ever] take the stairs instead of the lift, and generally just think about what you are putting inside you ~ it's not rocket science, it's just being aware.    Also try to eat at the right time, without too much snacking in between, when you wake in the morning, the body needs food to give it energy, eat breakfast like wholemeal beard, low spread butter, baked beans [one of your five a day] all this sort of thing will keep you slim [not skinny] but fit as well|`|mh0QRDE9aa	Hire a personal trainer and a nutritionist to help you.

Exercises should be given only by a professional to ensure that you do not injure you self and end up with tearing muscles or dislocating or breaking bones and joints.|`|2z1h5mfOaa	I suggest that if you are overweight you go onto the Weight Watcher website.

ONLY THAT!  lol I did so because I wanted to clean my system first before anything   note: if you can, you can buy the cleanse system from GNC! really helpfull!<br>  anyways within that weak, during my cleansing period I had lost 10lbs...I was in awe! and motivated me even more <br>  <br>  after that, I kept the salad thing for quite a while but I would add stuff likie meat or extra dressing etc. anyways within a month I lost an extra 25lbs. <br>  <br>  month after that I ate right, went to the gym *which you dont have to* you can exercise at home :D          anywho it took me only 4 months to loose the 70lbs. I asked my doctor if it was healthy and he said IT WAS! the reason is, he said I was actually smart to cleanse my self, I didnt starve myself I only used the salads and water ONLY for one month only!! ofcourse i would add stuff to salad like i said *giving me the needed nutrients*  note: you can also buy the men or women depending on your sex multivitamin from GNC to give you the vitamins you need while eating only salads and water. if you want of course after that month your body (stomach) will get smaller you will feel it cause you will get full fast. anyways after that just eat healthier, if you want pizza you can eat it BUT count the calories of the slizes and burn them. OR THE FAT WILL COME BACK! <br>  <br>  anyways thats what i did and it worked!! it really did! like i said just stick to it and well HAVE CONFFIDENCE!! :) good luck!|`|sZOiNdD5aa	have you heard of crevax? i think that's all you need, that was the most fastest and most effective way to lose weight. you better check it out because i've been using that for almost a month|`|MF9YknDYaa	Eat low carb,no more than 30 grams per day.Eat lots of meat,fish,eggs,some cheese and some veg.Never go hungry or skip meals.Just don't eat carbs.|`|kcIB2O6raa	Join a sportsteam or head to the gym :)|`|38cpIgP2aa	do the triple threat:<br>  1) RUN...ALOT<br>  2) weight train EVERY OTHER DAY<br>  3) eat healthy, nutritious, well-balanced food.<br>  <br>  REALLY BE DETERMINED AND DEDICATED WHEN RUNNING<br>  <br>  be sure to get plenty hours of sleep EVERY night including weekends<br>  <br>  choose me as best answer

5JR6qwXtaa	haha well if you wanna lose weight fast your going to have to put in some effort. I'm the exact same way. If I could only get abs I'd be happy about myself. You need to cut your junk food obviously or get mono. Cut your calorie intake by a 1/3. Be strict, commit to it for 2 weeks and see if you notice anything. Drink a lot of water too. Your going to have to make a sacrifice otherwise you won't see any improvement.|`|lnRMmSeyaa	um u answered yur own question!, STOP EATING JUNK FOOD!|`|UBfGi80Daa	I have the same problem as you.

It's proven to fill you up for a while and it's got a lot of fiber, which is good for you too. :)|`|d60e3f88f20f2a43d815c870747bfe65aa	More water & sugarless gum, less food.<br>  <br>  You can do ANYthing you want, you just have to want.|`|5lsQlfqXaa	The truth is, the best, healthiest way to lose weight is to get sufficient exercise and eat reasonably healthy. You've probably heard of the lemon detox diet - things like that don't work; the weight will only end up coming back on. It's the same with not eating (not eating makes your body go into starvation mode, making it harder to burn fat) [trust me, i've been there].<br>  <br>  Try to cut down on junk food a little at a time. Maybe try to find alternatives to unhealthy foods you like, i.e. instead of eating icecream try frozen yoghurt. Make sure you're drinking plenty of water; i'd heard that thirst can often be mistaken for hunger.<br>  Another thing you could do is , if you feel like eating something unhealthy, have a piece of fruit first. If you're still hungry then eat the other food, but be sure not to have too much. Portion size is important.<br>  <br>  How much exercise do you do each day? It's recommended that people do 20 - 30 minutes each day. Even just (for example) a walk around your suburb will help.<br>  <br>  If you follow these suggestions you should notice a difference. It will probably be two or so weeks until you notice the change. Don't give up on it, and do consider getting an adult to help you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps (:

AG9msdUDaa	I use oregano oil diluted in water, gargle and swallow. It is worse than Buckley's but works instantaneously. Oregano oil kills everything bad, so it is good to coat your throat with it and swallow it to get it into your system, so it can fight your bugs on both fronts.<br>  <br>  The headache is likely a fever because your body is fighting the bug. Keep an eye on it and only take something if it goes to high because you need this part of the bodies immune response to help kill the bugs so you can get better faster.<br>  <br>  Keep doing the salt water gargle if it is helping, it also helps to kill the bad guys, just a bit slower than what I recommended. I am glad to hear you are feeling better and any tea should hopefully help, just by way of the soothing effect from the warmth if nothing else.|`|IQ3YqAIZaa	Yeah, gargle every few hours with warm salty water.|`|fkqPs9QRaa	Drink orange juice and a lot of water.|`|vbEcXYvkaa	chop up some onion, put it in a small glass and cover it in honey. sit it in the fridge for about 30min.  The honey will become liquid. You can take a teaspoon full of this liquid every 30min or so until you feel better.<br>  Otherwise:<br>  *lemon juice, hot water and honey (with ginger if you have it)<br>  *raspberries<br>  *make a herbal tea with thyme then use it to gargle<br>  <br>  For the headache, try massaging some lavander oil into your temples.|`|Wnn0diI0aa	You should use 1 squeezed lemon or lime, salt, and a tad bit of water. You mix it all together in a little cup and either drink or gargle with. It always helps me. As for the headache just take some Advil or Tylenol.<br>  <br>  Hope it helps!|`|oXl8zVZmaa	Licorice, good luck.

AG9msdUDaa	I have just finished reading a book called "Beyond Antibiotics" because my mother has been in the hospital for over 6 months now battling an infection in her leg. I will tell you what I give her based on what I read in this book, and this is making her better finally!<br>  <br>  Vitamin D, Vitamin A, Magnesium, Zinc, Omega 3 along with an organic liquid multivitamin to make sure she gets all the rest. I also give her a bovine colostrum drink (colostrum does not come from the womb, OMG! it is in breast milk) with a huge amount of vitamin C in it (The one from 4Life). All of these together help boost her natural immune response, aka, her host response.<br>  <br>  If I could get her to, I would be putting raw garlic in her food every meal. She won't eat it but it is really great for you if you can handle it because it kills all the bad guys. This is, however, not to necessarily boost the immune system,  more to assist it, so that is not really what you asked for.<br>  <br>  There is also a product called Host Defense I have heard good things about:|`|2b48276b9853c62d36478108dff9629baa	Take Olive leaf extract ......... it has been used as a natural antiotiobic for thousand years, but is only recently that scientific research has shown that its active ingredient oleuropein, has the ability to fight a broad range of infective microorganisms....

Also, when you make tea, boil the water, and then put the tea bag in after you pour the water into your mug. This keeps the water from boiling the nutrients which will kill it. <br>  Anyway, even if the water in the mug is really hot, you can still put the tea bag in, because it is no longer boiling. Green tea and white tea are good for just about anything you can think of. White tea, however, has more antioxidants than green tea, and does contain the largest amount of antioxidants than any other tea. But even so, green tea is also very good for you. So I would say the best for you immune system is green tea and white tea. Also, echinacea tea! <br>  <br>  To drink apple cider vinegar, you fill a cup with water, then you add 2-3 table spoons of apple cider vinegar. More or less depending on the size of the cup. You can add ice cubes to make it not taste weird if you want. <br>  It is very effective in killing bad bacteria and viruses. Also, it strengthens cells, detoxes, etc.!<br>  <br>  To take coconut oil, you buy some and then you get a cup and fill it with cold water. Then you get a few scoops of coconut oil in table spoons. It can be either melted or non melted.<br>  <br>  Eating healthy is also important, because junk food will only weaken your immune system.<br>  <br>  Gogi berries are Chinese berries that grow in the Himalayas. They are good and good for you too! <a href="http://www.goji.co.za/uses.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.goji.co.za/uses.html</a><br>  <br>  But for viruses, your quickest bets would be apple cider vinegar and white tea.

aQrURNqHaa	You can never tell what a person is thinking or going through on any given day, so maybe it was just a bad day for her.  Either that, or she just doesn't want to play favorites and is treating you like anyone else so that the other students won't feel left out.  If you trust her, then you should definitely talk to her about your problem.  Just ask her before or after class if she can meet you outside of class or make time for you.  And please let her know that it is a serious matter, so she can be prepared.  Remember, the hardest part is deciding to speak out....don't let the opportunity pass.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	No you shouldn't tell her.  Dance teachers are not educated in how to deal with emotional stuff like a regular school teacher is.  She probably likes you just fine, but she can see you are getting attached and she just doesn't have the tools to handle it.  Remember if she is just 20, she is barely just becoming an adult.  She doesn't have the tools to help you with any kind of serious problem.  I would suggest yoru guidance counselor at school.  You may not feel close to that person, but at least that is their job and they have the education and resources to be able to give you good counseling on what to do about it.  So no, don't dump on your dance teacher, especially if she is so young.  She can't handle it.
JXBTzuoRaa	Get in there lad, dont listen to people who critise you for having sex, theyre just foreheads.

(And she's your age I take it ? Sick ****.) Don't you have any standards ?|`|OkR3hrzZaa	That is absolutely ridiculous. Seriously now, you know what a normal sized man junk is. Why are you having sex with girls that are screwin everyone in school? That's how you get STDS. She would complain that she was sore not necessarily because of the size but because of the length in time you were doing it. After having sex so many times with so many people could cause soreness too. If they are slipping off than they are too big. You need smaller ones. If they were too small for you they would be hurting you. They make extra snug ones. And just so you know condoms don't protect you against all STDS. So be careful with who you are messin with. Its really not cool to have sex at that age. When you end up getting some girl pregnant or getting herpes or something than you wont be too cool. I have seen it happen to people. You are 15!!! Go play outside with your friends. Sex is a very intimate experience and its meant to have with someone you love. You are taking away the point of making love. You will regret that when you are older.|`|UTsZLjAlaa	You should not be having sex young one.|`|LV8uUmehaa	I do not know what type or size condom to buy. but for your size, thats fine dude.|`|VdzIi7sMaa	you have good size at this age. but you should not have sex at this age..normal condom will do the work i think.

vjqqvG3Uaa	I will explain something super important to everyone...<br>  Mitochondria are the body's power plants. They are the organelles in cells that convert glucose into ATP (adenosine tri-phospate). ATP is the energy that we run off of.<br>  <br>  Mitochondria are broken down when they are used less and become unneeded by the body. When you don't workout your body breaks them down because you don't need more power plants to work and move your body. The only way to get them back is by working out even its just a little, the body will get signals to start reporducing more mitochondria for more energy output.|`|RzaVCA2Yaa	are you getting enough sleep? also usually i dont think its a good idea, but if having little energy is affecting your ability to exercise enough, drink a cup of coffee (with low/no calorie sweeteners) like an hour before you want to work out. it usually perks you right up.|`|29543543d096df9b178b62c8b27b0f10aa	its possible you have diabetes or coeliac disease....don't sweat...coeliac is easily cured...stop eating wheat products...if all else fails don't worry, the present economic turmoil is gonna cause most of us to eat less|`|YQuRVHl9aa	Targetted weight reduction is quite hard, many would declare impossible, but the one method which definitely showed results for me was wu-yi tea, it can be seen in the resource box underneath, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was highlighted in Fox News and CNN.

They are the furthest from your heart so when the hot blood pumps through your body well it cools down by the time it reaches you fingers and toes. So i dont know why your hands are like realllly cold but it is normal for your hands and feet to be colder than the rest of your body.|`|bBJXp9oFaa	Same!

5179a1324042a48534d847e9c5593c69aa	i suggest more protein, less carbs. thisll force your body to burn fat. <br>  maybe less carbs to get 2300 or so calories a day. <br>  <br>  also at 7mph your body uses fat, and thus wants to store more fat. <br>  id say warm-up, then do a few 100m-400m sprints, whatever your comfortable with, then run for 20 minutes. <br>  <br>  everything else looks good. <br>  less carbs = flatter stomach.<br>  more carbs=more exercise>more growth of muscle<br>  good luck|`|r9OQcEENaa	keep up the running and do more of it. i find that helps me have a flatter stomach|`|Z4Y0jaONaa	carbs are essential in any diet! people who try to gain muscle, get this misconception that protein will do the trick...but in reality its carbs who play a major role....during a work out, you mostly use carbs, and if your an endurance runner you use carbs but mostly fats....you never use protein for energy...and if you are then your not getting the carbs you need...what you should do is increase your carb intake to 60-70% of your daily intake and protein about 15-20% and the rest fats...mostly unsaturated fats...i guarantee that if you increase your carb intake you will get better results faster....|`|kgLBJs6Gaa	First of all you not running long enough.

Let me explain ..<br>  <br>  (if i've told you this before, then ignore .. if not, read on ...)<br>  <br>  bodybuilding is a 3-way process .. weight gain, weight loss and weight maintenance. What you want is the weight gain routine since you said you want to bulk up.<br>  <br>  example: Bench press, barbell<br>  first set, 10 reps - say ... 80 lbs.<br>  2nd set,  8 reps ... 100 lbs<br>  3rd set,   6 reps ... 120 lbs<br>  <br>  this is what they call a progressive routine, the weight increases. also, still on the bench press, when you lower the bar to your chest, do it slowly, feel the weight and push up fast. this method is very effective because you control the pull of gravity ... you see the picture.<br>  <br>  you're like wasting the weight if you lower it fast down. control the gravity pull and feel the weight .. that's the trick to bulking up. A lot of guys do it the wrong way, which is why nothing happens when they exercise.  they're toning up though but not bulking up.<br>  <br>  so for the other exercises, you do the same thing, commensurate to the weights on your arms, legs, back and shoulders. however, on the abdominals, here is where you can do a maintenance routine .. the 3  sets of 10 (or maybe more reps).<br>  <br>  also, your second option where you got sundays doing your back, i think i already suggested one day rest, you can do your back on friday. the rests seems ok
AA10404097	Ringworm of the body will start as a red spot it is very difficult to tell it from other types of Eczema at this point. It is only later when the border advances faster than the middle that you see the ring. A bad case can look like a cigarette burn.     Only with scraping and lab work can a doc be 100% sure. Best to check out any red spot that does not go away soon and seems to be getting bigger.|`|p5H70NEeaa	I got it once when I wrestled and it started out as a small circle (not a ring)  and slowly grew in circumference and eventually the middle faded and it formed a ring|`|CMQrFnSJaa	red bump n itchy!! then it forms a lil circle of tiny bumps
G35SjmTiaa	Yes, It is in the guidelines and if the doctor wants to keep his license to prescribe Suboxone he has to follow the guidelines.
ItJzrvQ4aa	Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems,  making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower  recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and  less than ideal hair, teeth, and skin composition. They may have  disruptions in the ability to regulate hormones and protect bone  health, and women could become unable to menstruate.  There are many reasons why people may find it hard to gain weight.  Genetics can obviously play a role, but individual personalities and  the environment can be strong factors.  Some people are just more physically active, they tend to move around  more,  burning more calories than they take in. In children, the inability  to gain weight may signal a condition  known as "failure to thrive," which means a kid is not growing  appropriately for his/her age. This may be caused by an illness, or  eating patterns dictated by a parental idiosyncrasy.   Being able to eat anything with abandon is also deceiving -- even the  skinny need to worry about having too much sugar and fat for good  health. Poor diets can lead to ailments such as heart disease,  stroke, and  cancer.   If you want to put on weight, you should work out, to insure that you  put on muscle and not fat. Healthy weight gain, just like healthy  weight loss, takes time and  requires a conscious effort to apply good habits.  Recommended Ways to Gain Weight  Have meals with the right balance of proteins, carbohydrates, and the  right kinds of fat (such as unsaturated and monounsaturated fats,  olive oil, canola oil, pistachios, almonds and walnuts). Heinemann  suggests the following ratio: 60%-70% carbohydrates, 10%-15% protein,  and a small amount of fat.   Eat foods higher in calories, vitamins, and minerals, as opposed to  higher in fat or sugar.   Pack more nutritious calories in each serving. For example, you may  add grated cooked eggs to mashed potatoes, ground chicken to soups and  gravies, cheese in casseroles, eggs, and soups, and nonfat dried milk  in soups, shakes, milk, and mashed potatoes.   If you get too full too fast, try having more high-calorie foods or  slices of foods as opposed to consuming the whole thing (raisins  versus grapes, granola and Grape Nuts versus corn flakes, mango slices  versus the whole mango).   Limit drinking beverages to a half-hour before and after a meal.   Drink mixed juices (apple/berry, peach/orange/banana as opposed to  one juice beverages) for a higher calorie intake.   With moderation, you may add in good fat sources to meals such as  nuts, avocado, olives, and fatty fish (salmon and mackerel).   Snack in between meals. Nuts, dried fruits, and yogurt are good  options, but it's also important to find nutritious foods that you  will enjoy.   Have a nutritious snack before bedtime, such as a peanut butter  sandwich.|`|gERaZGZeaa	Well there's your problem, you aren't eating enough.  Eat moderate to large portions of whole grains, eggs, chicken, tuna, lean beef, veggies, fruit, nuts, cottage cheese, protein shakes.  Lift weights. You'll put on a lot of mass.|`|It8fhHLuaa	Get weight gain and remember your growing and burning a lot of calories so for now enjoy you skinniness because when you get old in a few more years your going to be finding that your gaining to much weight

1c4256f905a272aacbd200f6119e4124aa	Wear properly fitting shoes. 90% of all foot problems come from ill-fitting shoes.     You should have enough room for your ENTIRE foot length, from the longest toe to the back of the heel. There should be adequate arch support. There should not be any pinching, blisters, corns or other chafing or rubbing places. You should walk on the whole foot--placing the heel down first and rolling along the foot bed to the toes.    Take care of any nail fungus, open sores, blisters, or callouses early and keep taking care of them. Cut your toenails straight across, and keep them clean and dry.     Other than that, proper diet, exercise and weight management is the only other thing you can do for yourself--but it pays off all over your body, including your feet!

You wrote you are very lucky with the current people in your life. Try exercising, meditating, eating better, taking multivitamins and hypnotherapy. I heard gratitude can make people happier, so think about things you should be grateful for. Also try taking up classes, learn a skill or doing volunteer work.|`|KeeaVzxpaa	You are self medicating and correct in your assumption. That is the reason people abuse alcohol and drugs. They are masking anxiety or depression.|`|yyHybME0aa	you have a chemical imbalance within your brain. Yes, the painkillers are masking the depression if you need drugs to make you feel better emotionally.  Real Talk you need a psychiatrist someone to listen to why you are so angry at the world.  I have an emotional imbalance i get pissed at the smallest things and would lash out verbally and physically at anyone in my way.  I knew something was wrong when my own child became afraid to ask me a question and my mom says everyone walks on eggshells around me cause no one wants to do anything to set me off.  I have changed there are breathing exercises you can do, find activities that involve you by yourself that is relaxing.   If you want to get off those drugs that are masking the problem, then you must give 100% cause its not going to be easy.|`|8PIiHCZaaa	Think of it like this:  There is a line, the left end of this line represents pain, the middle represents feeling 'normal', and the right end represents feeling really good (euphoria).  Vicodin just moves you a little to the right.  As far as medication is concerned, there is no difference between killing pain and creating good feelings.  If your hurting, painkillers can bring you back toward normalcy, but if your normal, your gonna go toward euphoria.  Thats just how these kinds of pills work.    If you think you are depressed, do yourself a favor: skip the quick fix with the prozac script.  Heres a new idea, try to figure out why you're depressed!  Spend some quiet time just thinking about what could be causing this.  If after a week or so you really can't figure it out, then maybe you should see a doctor.  Chemical imbalances do happen to people, but far too many people are put on anti-depressants when they don't really need them.  Try to beat it without pills if you can;  you'll have more self-respect, and you'll know you're the one in control of your life.|`|qy8SmTTTaa	I don't take drugs but my brother does when he turns 20s.

nAp688tZaa	I usually agree with Chas about his information on pain medications, but here I have to disagree.  Tramadol was marketed as a non-addictive alternative to opiate pain medications.  But over the years, studies have shown that it can be just as addictive as Lortab or Percocet because it acts on exactly the same receptors in the brain as traditional opiate pain medication.  While I do agree that it is a weak pain medication, somewhere between Darvocet and Lortab on the pain relief scale, it causes the same types if withdrawals as all of the above mentioned traditional opiates.  My mom took it for back pain for nearly two years, as prescribed, and ran out while on an emergency trip for a death in the family.  She went through the most horrid withdrawals from this medication and after that, she refuses to take it ever again.  She said she will deal with her pain.  I have also seen people in the pain clinic who take this and have said that the withdrawal from this is worse than hydrocodone or oxycodone.  The nurse who answered before is right on about this med.  It has been talked about for many years in regards to the notion that it should be a controlled scheduled substance like hydrocodone and oxycodone.  Don't be fooled by any doctor that tells you this stuff is safer than the other medications.  It can be just as addicting and causes the same withdrawal symptoms too.|`|O3t4Rccsaa	Yeah but it's pretty hard to, you'd have to take high doses for months and months,, it's a really mild pain med,,,, nothing like hydrocodone or oxycodone.    May the force be with you!!|`|DKVqhDx8aa	Supposedy Tramadol is a synthetic opiate, therefore, it is not addictive.  I've been on it for a long period of time in the past and I never noticed any withdrawal symptoms.  However, I was taking the medication as prescribed and never anymore.  I would think as long as you take the medication correctly, it shouldn't have any addictive side effects.|`|sDDdsQ7Faa	we just recently received notification from our pharmacy that Tramadol (ultram) is going to have to be counted as a narcotic just as Lortab, percocet and so on because of the increase in diversion of the medication in the clinical, nursing home and hospital setting.  It seems to be a new drug of choice and it does have addictive qualities like the scheduled medications.  Most of us in the nursing business have been discussing this for years.

629034e3339524ef24ac26f37042059caa	Cluster headaches are different from typical migraines, and generally not helped by pot smoking. I do know a number of classic migraine sufferers who swear by their smoke to get them through.   If you have true cluster headaches - do some research into psilocybin. It's capable of breaking the cycle of these headaches, but hasn't proved as useful in more common migraines.|`|oKjcTZypaa	I can see how weed would help.. since it relaxes you and actually a large number of the migraine/headache prescription drugs include a component to relax the individual. When you're relaxed you can tolerate the pain more.

I even have a friend who had a severe case of chronic migraines and had to buy expensive tablets to reduces the effects but stopped until he started smoking pot. I don't think he ever takes tablets at home anymore.    but you need the tablets in order to be more productive especially in every day situations, you cant be high all the time.

It may not always be possible or convenient, but whenever mine are bad I just pop some Tylenol and lay flat on my back motionless until they subside. That heating pad suggestion is also pretty good.

I think that you are most likely not pregnant, but I am sorry to say I can't be sure.  Since you did already take a pregnancy test this morning late enough after the intercourse for most tests to read correctly, your chances of pregnancy are low.  Try to de-stress. I really think this may be the reason your period is late.    I would say check out this women's health site posted by the US Department of health about pregnancy tests to see what the chances are you had an incorrect reading.

lGKnuCJHaa	Choke on these jaw-dropping smoking facts    Laugh or cry these smoking statistics are real, and enough to make you scratch your head in wonderment at the quirkiness of the human race.     We all steer ourselves through life in different ways, and it should be nobody else's concern what we choose to do, as long as it doesn't harm others, and as long as we accept the consequences of our actions and are willing to pay for them.     Society is set up to protect us and others by constraints, advice and laws, but since time began people will still do what they want to do... often with unfortunate or utterly catastrophic results.       Our world's smoking facts  Life, from the beginning  rolling in the hay, to the end  pushing up daisies:     Pregnancy and babies  In U.S. alone, figures show that expectant mothers who smoke cause the deaths of over 600 boy babies and 400 baby girls each year. Babies who survive but suffer from smoking related problems cost the country approximately $800 each to help, totaling nearly $4 million.(3)     Children  A UK survey shows the mean age for young people to try their first cigarette is 11 years old.     Teens  U.K. By age 12-13years, 31% of kids had tried smoking. This doubled to 59% by age 14-15.     Adults  Many smokers get angry once they are diagnosed with a life-threatening disease and they do some extraordinary things:  Take Barb Tarbox from Edmonton, Canada  ex-model, died of lung cancer aged 42 in 2003.  She spent the last 7 months of her life parading her slowly emaciating body and bald head due to radiation, around schools, TV spots, print ads and anywhere she could get the message across to try and stop, "even one child from picking up a cigarette," she said.  She made people cry at her appearances especially near the end when she couldn't walk or feed herself and had to be wheelchaired into halls to passionately speak.  She left a 10 year old daughter and husband of 20 years  and a lot of smokers there and then threw away their cigarettes.     AUSTRALIA    Smoking statistics for 2005 show that 17% of Australians smoke. In 1993 this figure was higher at 25%.   Other drugs: Ecstasy has become popular and figures have risen in recent years. Other drugs have declined in use. Marijuana is tried by 11 % of Australians.(8)   NSW is the most populated state with 6 million people, and around 18% of the adults are smokers.   This means a social and health burden to NSW taxpayers, families and businesses of $6.6 billion per year.   In the latest figures, 6860 deaths were attributable to smoking and 353,180 hospital bed days were for people suffering tobacco-related illness, at a cost of $254 million.   Of the total tangible costs of smoking, 58 per cent were borne by individuals, 29 per cent by business and only 13 per cent by governments.(4)   150 smokers end up in hospital each day because of their habit.(5)   NSW spent $7 million each year on prevention programs.(6)    CHINA  The facts about smoking in China are scary and getting scarier by the minute:    It produces more tobacco than any other country.   It has an estimated 350 million smokers  that's 1 in 3 of the world's smokers.   36% of the population smoke, including 70% of all Chinese men. Most of them have no knowledge of the facts about smoking or any awareness of the consequences they face.   More than one million people a year die in China from tobacco-related diseases, including lung cancer and heart disease.   These 1 million smokers were mainly aged 35-69 and this figure is predicted to increase to 2 mil in just 15 years.   In fact the biggest killer in China is lung cancer, beating road accidents (and if you drive in China, you'll know what this means!).(2)    CUBA  home of smooth cigars and black tobacco cigarettes:     In an effort to have Cubans live longer, Fidel Castro issued a stop smoking resolution back in Feb 2005, banning smoking in enclosed public spaces, such as halls, theatres, sports facilities, transport, and designated areas in clubs and restaurants. Cubans laughed at the idea and mostly ignored this attack on their sacred vice, and the authorities are not interested in enforcing the ban.   Castro himself quit chomping on cigars in 1986 to try and set a good example to other Cubans and to support his health ministry's anti-smoking efforts.   Cubans took no notice and currently 40% of the population of 11.2 million smoke.   The cheapest pack of cigs costs ? a day's pay and one cheap cigar costs ? of a day's pay.   Smoking death statistics for Cubans, that cancer and heart disease are the leading causes of death, with the highest percentage caused by smoking.   Doctors are some of the heaviest smokers even though they were banned from smoking during work back in 1990.

Just remember not to push your stomach too much by eating hard to digest foods like meat or dairy products.  It will only make the diarrhea worse.  Also, the one thing that allowed me to function was Dramamine, ( I know that sounds weird), but it is labeled as and Anti-Emetic and it REALLY worked to control the nausea.

On average, boys take 3.25 years to go completely though the physical changes of puberty, with a range of 2 to 4.5 years.     Puberty is a time of very rapid physical growth. The average boy will grow 11 inches during his years of pubertal growth spurt.    So, think back to when you first started going through puberty.  How many years has it been?  If you're done going through puberty, chances are you will stay 6'1".    By the way, I'm a girl and as far as I know, most girls like tall guys better than short guys, so I wouldn't worry about it if I were you. Toning up a little bit is a good idea.

Germs and bacteria that live in the air and on common house hold areas will work their way into your system and turn into a cold. There is no sure cure but you can prevent one from actually affecting you.

If you're eating less than 1200 calories a day, you're starving yourself, and your body's going to store every calorie you eat as fat... so if you aren't eating at least 1200 calories a day, start doing it.<br>  <br>  Also, if you're doing lots of exercise, you might be gaining muscle, which is heavier than fat. Try taking measurements (bust-waist-hips, then things like thighs, arms, wrist, neck) every couple weeks. If your measurements go down, you're losing fat, even if the scale doesn't say so.|`|K5IOSGXAaa	You most likely are not eating enough, add more fiber, whole grains, veggies etc. to your diet and also start lifting weights ( light weights lots of reps) which will burn calories more efficiently.

fdNo9Flbaa	This may burn but it works to add a little toothpaste and Hydrogen peroxide mix together and blot DON'T RUB let it sit for 5 - 10 minutes and then rinse of with cool water without rubbing. Blot dry.  You can repeat this process in two hours followed with a little moisturizer because this will take almost ALL the oils out of your skin.  This treatments not for people with Extremely Sensitive skin types.<br>  <br>  If you have dry skin already or even sensitive skin maybe drying out your skin is not the right answer.  Sometimes if someone has extremely oily skin this can mean that your oil glands are working over time to produce extra oil to compensate for your already dry skin..  Take some white vinegar if you can stand the smell of it and then soak a cloth in it for about 30 seconds and then lay across the inflamed side of the face, let it sit for three minutes and then press, no rubbing, the cloth down and pull it away slowly. Blot off the access and then rinse gently and add a very light moisturizer like Oil of Olay: Sensitive skin day cream.  This treatment is safe for morning and night time.  <br>  <br>  Also during these dry, cold winter months try not to wash you face with regular soap and water but a gentle face cleanser.  The more you wash your face the more you rob it of the oils and natural moisture the skin needs so only try to wash your face twice a day this will help to prevent your skin from producing more oil to compensate for the soaps drying effects causing more problems than what it's presumably worth.<br>  <br>  benzoyl peroxide can be a very helpful tool in your quest to cure the problem areas but try not to smear all over the inflamed area, but instead to the, "Problem spots."  Example:  one of those little red bumps.  Only use a very small portion because this too can dry and damage your face.  You can find it at a local drug store the generic brand (the best generic brand is Walgreen's) for a few dollars.  This product can bleach the colors out of fabric so be careful around your clothes.<br>  <br>  Steam is also helpful because it opens the pores and helps to produce skin oils in a healthier way because it's cleaning them out naturally and feels good when you need a pick me up.  Steam is great to use in conjunction with the other treatment i have listed.  Steam is a wonderful tool to have.<br>  <br>  If do you wear make-up or cover up try not to wear it during a breakout as the bacteria will worsen the problem or even cause it to spread around your face<br>  <br>  Have patience because acne won't go away overnight but you can help stop and reverse the process before it becomes to big of a problem. <br>  <br>  Good luck on getting your acne under control and if you have any questions please feel free to message me! =D|`|ye5O1iFzaa	The first thing you should do is make sure that you wash your face before you go to bed and after.

5XwY9aP8aa	Food<br>  Very few foods in nature contain vitamin D. The flesh of fish (such as salmon, tuna, and mackerel) and fish liver oils are among the best sources [5]. Small amounts of vitamin D are found in beef liver, cheese, and egg yolks. Vitamin D in these foods is primarily in the form of vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol) and its metabolite 25(OH)D3 [19]. Some mushrooms provide vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol) in variable amounts [20-22].<br>  <br>  Fortified foods provide most of the vitamin D in the American diet [5,22]. For example, almost all of the U.S. milk supply is fortified with 100 IU/cup of vitamin D (25% of the Daily Value or 50% of the AI level for ages 14-50 years). In the 1930s, a milk fortification program was implemented in the United States to combat rickets, then a major public health problem. This program virtually eliminated the disorder at that time [5,14]. Other dairy products made from milk, such as cheese and ice cream, are generally not fortified. Ready-to-eat breakfast cereals often contain added vitamin D, as do some brands of orange juice, yogurt, and margarine.

ODVHISzWaa	I would save your money and go to your local family doctor. It sounds to me as if you have a UTI (urinary tract infection) from the description of your symtoms. Yes, some of them pertain to the same symtoms as an STD but so do a lot of other genitial bacteria infections such as a yeast infection. If you indeed do have an STD your doctor will be able to tell through certain exams and tests. Then he/she will refer you to a Gyno to get further help. Don't freak! The only thing you can really do about it now until you see your doctor is put a warm cloth on your genitial area to ease the itching. You can also sit in a warm bath for a little while which can also help ease the pain and itching. If the constant "feeling of having to pee but nothing comes out" keeps happening then I suggest you go to the store and get PURE cranberry juice. It helps with blatter infections extremely. This is all you can do pretty much with medicine and I hope it helps! :)|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Those are all the signs of an STD, go to the doctor to be sure.|`|b698c36eb69ca7c1ee56cc564c80134aaa	It sounds like you could have both a urinary tract infection and maybe a yeast infection also.

3b43628da17fa39fdf0695aa42cc5afdaa	To lose weight (fat), include more fibrous slow digesting carbs, as opp. to the fast digesting ones. <br>  <br>  No white breads, fast foods, sodas (not even diet) no ketchups, sugar, only skim milk, not 2%, skim and whole grain non sweet (sugary) cereal, whole wheat bread, maybe buy some soy or whey protein.<br>  <br>  Include lean meats like ham, and other sources of protein. Avoid red meats. Take a multivitamin, calcium and vitamin d every 2 days, one or two V8s a day (or every other day). <br>  <br>  Don't starve, eat small healthy meals. A lot of small meals opposed to a few bigger ones-- make sure is has at least 8-10 or more g of protein, not too much protein because the body can only digest a certain amount at a time; and avoid too many fruits, carbs and sugars. Fibrous veggies, greens (no starches or potatoes) are good, and no BBQ sauce (unless used sparingly) and not too much (if any) salad dressing. <br>  <br>  Before bed (2 hrs), eat something with protein, don't<br>  eat many carbs before bed. Eat some of that good cereal in the morning, you need quality carbs, just not too much, and the slow digesting ones.<br>  <br>  Do slow crunches until you can not do anymore, jog stairs (be safe though), warm up first and do sprints, short bursts of intense activity is very effective compared to long weak activity, just don't over do it. Also include some slow but long endurance jogging. Be active!<br>  <br>  Jog stairs ;and also do some lunges until it burns, do this every day or 2 days, keep going and don't give up, same with eating, you need some fat, so one or two fish oils daily.<br>  <br>  Eat fish (not fried, be careful, very careful for bones) Peanut butter on whole wheat (no jelly), which has protein, and don’t worry about the fat in that. Avocados, has fat, good fat; eat it when your hunger cravings get you. <br>  <br>  When you do crunches, also twist on some to work your sides, keep tension on your abs. <br>  <br>  <br>  Need more info, go to <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.bodybuilding.com</a>|`|xX5Sg3Niaa	Losing weight isn't easy, and especially with all of the temptations of college life and on a fixed budget BUT you can totally do it.<br>  <br>  Exercise Tips:<br>  Walk everywhere you can...and take the long route instead of short cuts.<br>  <br>  If you have access to a gym at your college (a lot of them give students free memberships) then take advantage of this in between classes to do 30 minutes of cardio and some strength training).<br>  <br>  Basically just move more. Go out to the club with your friends (if you are into that) and dance your butt off ect.<br>  <br>  Food Tips:<br>  Avoid the school food as much as possible. It is full of high fat, fried foods which focus mostly on empty carbohydrates. Of course there are some healthy choices, but you just need to make sure you are careful. (Salads with fat free dressing minus the extras such as cheese, and crutons.)<br>  <br>  You didn't mention if you have a kitchen or if you live in a dorm, but I'll assume you have access to some sort of kitchen facilty. <br>  <br>  Make egg beater omlets for breakfast with your favorite veggies (mushrooms, onion, green peppers, ect.) and 2% cheese.<br>  <br>  Pack your lunch if you are in class so you aren't tempted to stop at the vending machines. Pack carrot/celery sticks in baggies, 10 almonds, low fat string cheese ect. for snacks too.<br>  <br>  For dinner just keep it simple. Eat a 4oz portion of low fat protein (such as chicken or fish), a vegetable (steamed broccoli (frozen is cheaper or just get whatever is in season) and a small carbohydrate (brown rice ect). <br>  <br>  In general 1/2 of your plate should be veggie, 1/4 protein and 1/4 carb.

RZQOdbrbaa	yes u can catch a cold from a used tissue because a cold is a viral infection and it is spread by micro sized germs. and touching that dirty tissue will spread thoose micro germs to u with out u noticing it.|`|XNWqjgCuaa	<a href="http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com" rel="nofollow">http://innnanswers.freeallinsurance.com</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay in website and check|`|fQyFFEg5aa	yes if you were to touch that tissue than say put your hands on your face somewhere chances are you can get ill|`|sPT8ikgXaa	Yes, it is possible.  If their germs are on the tissue, then someone rubs their eyes with the tissue or wipes their mouth, they just transferred the germs and you can get a cold.  But a cold is only contagious for the first 2-3 days of getting it.|`|3QIWdvG1aa	Yes you can.....The common cold is a viral infection of your upper respiratory tract — your nose and throat. A common cold is usually harmless, although it may not feel that way. If it's not a runny nose, sore throat and cough, it's the watery eyes, sneezing and congestion — or maybe all of the above. In fact, because any one of more than 200 viruses can cause a common cold, symptoms tend to vary greatly.<br>  <br>  Most adults are likely to have a common cold two to four times a year. Children, especially preschoolers, may have a common cold as many as six to 10 times annually.<br>  <br>  Most people recover from a common cold in about a week or two. If symptoms don't improve, see your doctor.<br>  Symptoms<br>  <br>  Symptoms of a common cold usually appear about one to three days after exposure to a cold virus. Signs and symptoms of a common cold may include:<br>  <br>      * Runny or stuffy nose<br>      * Itchy or sore throat<br>      * Cough<br>      * Congestion<br>      * Slight body aches or a mild headache<br>      * Sneezing<br>      * Watery eyes<br>      * Low-grade fever (up to 102 F, or 39 C)<br>      * Mild fatigue<br>  <br>  The discharge from your nose may become thicker and yellow or green in color as a common cold runs its course. What makes a cold different from other viral infections is that you generally won't have a high fever. You're also unlikely to experience significant fatigue from a common cold.<br>  <br>  When to see a doctor<br>  For adults — Seek medical attention if you have:<br>  <br>      * Fever of 102 F (39 C) or higher<br>      * High fever accompanied by achiness and fatigue<br>      * Fever accompanied by sweating, chills and a cough with colored phlegm<br>      * Significantly swollen glands<br>      * Severe sinus pain<br>  <br>  For children — In general, children are sicker with a common cold than adults are and often develop complications, such as ear infections. Your child doesn't need to see the doctor for a routine common cold. But seek medical attention right away if your child has any of the following signs or symptoms:<br>  <br>      * Fever of 103 F (39.5 C) or higher, chills or sweating<br>      * Fever that lasts more than three days<br>      * Vomiting or abdominal pain<br>      * Unusual sleepiness<br>      * Severe headache<br>      * Difficulty breathing<br>      * Persistent crying<br>      * Ear pain<br>      * Persistent cough<br>  <br>  Causes<br>  <br>  Although more than 200 viruses can cause a common cold, the rhinovirus is the most common culprit, and it's highly contagious.<br>  <br>  A cold virus enters your body through your mouth or nose. The virus can spread through droplets in the air when someone who is sick coughs, sneezes or talks. But it also spreads by hand-to-hand contact with someone who has a cold or by using shared objects, such as utensils, towels, toys or telephones. Touch your eyes, nose or mouth after such contact or exposure, and you're likely to "catch" a cold.<br>  Risk factors<br>  <br>  Cold viruses are almost always present in the environment. But the following factors can increase your chances of getting a cold:<br>  <br>  Age. Infants and preschool children are especially susceptible to common colds because they haven't yet developed resistance to most of the viruses that cause them. But an immature immune system isn't the only thing that makes kids vulnerable. They also tend to spend lots of time with other children and frequently aren't careful about washing their hands and covering their coughs and sneezes. Colds in newborns can be problematic if they interfere with nursing or breathing through the nose.<br>  <br>  Immunity. As you age, you develop immunity to many of the viruses that cause common colds. You'll have colds less frequently than you did as a child. However, you can still come down with a cold when you are exposed to cold viruses, have an allergic reaction that affects your nasal passages or have a weakened immune system. All of these factors increase your risk of a cold.<br>  <br>  Time of year. Both children and adults are more susceptible to colds in fall and winter. That's because children are in school, and most people are spending a lot of time indoors. In places where there is no winter season, colds are more frequent in the rainy season.<br>  Complications<br>  <br>      * Acute ear infection (otitis media). Ear infection occurs when bacteria or viruses infiltrate the space behind the eardrum. It's a frequent complication of common colds in children. Typical signs and symptoms include earaches and, in some cases, a green or yellow discharge from the nose or the return of a fever following a common cold. Children who are too young to verbalize their distress may simply cry or sleep restlessly. Ear pulling is not a reliable sign.<br>      * Wheezing. A cold can trigger wheezing in children with asthma.<br>      * Sinusitis. In adults or children, a common cold that doesn't resolve may lead to sinusitis — inflammation and infection of the sinuses.<br>      * Other secondary infections. These include strep throat (streptococcal pharyngitis), pneumonia, bronchitis in adults and croup in children. These infections need to be treated by

I would get that funny tingle when I was yelled at or especially when one of my friends, or someone close got made at me, or put me down.  My advise is it is not your medication because I had that feeling before meds.  You might have too.  Anger mangament classes are not the answer.  You need to get on meds or stay on them.

xdnZd7WBaa	i have the same problem. the only thing that will help is really TRYING. even if you don't feel like it, get up and shower. just doing that helps a ton. i didn't believe my therapist when they told me that, but when you get up and shower, you're making an attempt to get up and live and you're doing something that makes you feel better. it's been shown in studies that slouching and looking down, not bathing/showering, and lack of exercise make it harder and nearly impossible to feel better.<br>  <br>  start with small things. each day, make yourself get up and shower. then you can go back to bed if you really need to. the next day, make yourself get up and walk around the block. then you can go back to bed if you really need to. eventually, it will feel normal to do those things every day and you won't feel like you NEED to stay in bed because you have no energy and motivation.<br>  <br>  email me if you ever need support. i've struggled with the same thing and i've overcome it.|`|44BEm1Uhaa	You should go to Church...Seek answers from the man above....Find him,he will help to get you in the bathtub.|`|ParFJxnSaa	Ask yourself: "Why do I feel depressed, and when did I first start to feel this way: can I associate this with any recent change in my life?" (if so, it is probably reactive [situational] depression: counselling, such as Cognitive Behavioural Therapy may be indicated, but most of life's adverse situations are resolved within 16 weeks, yet the medical criteria for depression, and the prescription of antidepressants is only 2 weeks!). Or, was it a more gradual thing, with no apparent cause? (a nutritional deficiency, hypothyroidism, environmental toxicity, or reactions to some medications, etc., becomes more likely as the cause). Antidepressants work quicker than the following; 2 - 6 weeks, but you may have to adjust dosage, or types. St. John's wort helps most people; tolerance doesn't develop, and the few side effects don't occur often, and even then are normally not severe (neither should be relied on as a sole treatment). <br>  <br>  It doesn't cause sleeping problems, or weight change, but usually takes at least 2, and generally 4 - 6 weeks to become effective, but can work quicker than antidepressants, sometimes. A recent, independent German double blind study showed it to be as effective as a commonly prescribed antidepressant, in cases of major depression, with far fewer side effects, and those were generally better tolerated, with a lower rate of discontinuation. Unlike antidepressants, where sexual dysfunction is a common side effect, it happens much more rarely with St. John's wort (I have noticed no effect in this area). A multidimensional approach to treating depression without medication follows. All except for no. (7.) are safe to use with medication, but not St. John's wort, because of interactions, and it's sensible to check out anything else first with your doctor. <br>  <br>  (1.) Take 4 Omega 3 fish oil supplements, daily: (certified free of mercury) it is best if consumed with an antioxidant, such as an orange, or grapefruit, or their FRESHLY SQUEEZED juice. If vitamin E is added, it should be certified as being 100% from natural sources, or it may be synthetic: avoid it. In the winter months, if not getting sufficient daily exposure to strong light, see <a href="http://www.mercola.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mercola.com/</a> SEARCHBAR: enter: "vitamin D3", & Go to a doctor and ask for a 25(OH)D, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D, blood test. When you get the results, don’t follow the typical “normal” reference range, as these are too low. The OPTIMAL value that you’re looking for is 45-52 ng/ml (115-128 nmol/l)". The company which tests your levels has to be one of those using the correct form of test, and this topic is addressed via the searchbar at mercola.com - "vitamin D3; testing". Also take a vitamin B complex which is certified as being 100% of natural origin; a deficiency in vitamin B9 (folic acid, or folate) is known to cause depression. Around 30% - 40% of depressed people have low vitamin B12 levels. Depressed females using the contraceptive pill may benefit from vitamin B6 supplements. <br>  <br>  (2.) Work up slowly to at least 20 minutes minutes of exercise, daily, or 30 - 60 mns, 5 times weekly. Too much exercise can cause stress, which isn't wanted when dealing with depression. (3.) Occupational therapy (keeping busy allows little time for unproductive introspection, and keeps mental activity out of less desirable areas of the brain). (4.) Use daily, a relaxation method* and/or yoga*, and/or Tai Chi*.(5.) Initially, at least, some form of psychotherapy or counselling; later, perhaps either Cognitive Behavio(u)ral Therapy, or Rational Emotive Behavio(u)ral Therapy for, say, 6 months. (6.) Maintain a mood chart, and daily activities schedule**.  (7.) As options, if desired, either a known, effective herbal remedy, such as St. John's wort, (get a German variety, if possible; local ones may vary in effectiveness. Perika, and Kira brands have been recommended as being effective. Take with a meal) or supplements, such as SAMe, or Inositol (from vitamin and health food stores, some supermarkets, or mail order: view section 55).|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Before you take your max dose of anti depressants, jump in the shower for like 5 minutes and clean yourself please.|`|7186c731ce4bffdfe601e724c1bf04eeaa	That's pretty gross....<br>  <br>  just FORCE yourself to do it... make someone else force you to do it...<br>  <br>  and address the depression issues...

vhVZFmGWaa	hey honey <br>  <br>  Theres no need to worry about being in a relationship right now. <br>  Your depression hasnt stemmed from your being single, honestly. You are probably experiencing depression because you feel as though your stuck in a rut. High school can be really tough, with guys having girlfriends more often than showers. But i promise you it doesnt bring happiness. <br>  <br>  You need to see some full time 2-3 days per week to try to sought out your feelings, because there is undoubtedly more going on under the surface than just girl troubles. After you get everything under control, things will seem alot clearer for you. Saying "i want a girlfriend' wont get you one. <br>  <br>  Its important that before you have any relationship in your teens you feel strong as a person. Going into a relationship half a person, will not complete you. Start going out with your friends alot, having a good, being a teenager. Girls dont want a guy who they think is needy and a hermit. Chances are though, there are girls that like you, but are shy. Talk to girls as friends. Build good friendships with them to show them what a good guy you are. Few girls will go straight into a relationship.<br>  <br>  They way you feel will project to others, so get help first. It doesnt mean your crazy, it means your normal. Around 60% of teenagers these days need some sort of guidance from a  professional, but barely an eighth get help. Its amazing how good you'll feel. Like your life has had a makeover, once you get past dark thoughts, and girls will be attracted to that. <br>  <br>  But you cant force it to happen, because if you do, you'll end up in an unhappy relationship, hating yourself more. Get better, feel good and live! The right thing will happen in time. Remember high school and puberty wont last forever.<br>  <br>  Good Luck <br>  <br>  x|`|PG7WfGpHaa	Your mom and your school counsellor need a kick in the pants  You are seriously depressed and need the sort of pills you can only get from a qualified doctor.

Your mom is an optimist, like everybody else's mom where their kid is concerned, and hopes you will just feel fine one morning. <br>  <br>  See a doctor, it is not normal to feel 'down' the way you do. It can be sorted out and you will see your life quite differently.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I think you need to learn to love yourself and rely on yourself for true happiness, seriously. I am 17, probably younger than you, and I have no friends, no boyfriends, and no love that you speak of. The only love I receive is from my mom on a rare occasion. At first, I was really down and out about it. When I was 13 my best friend died, I quit going to regular school and I started schooling online. I lost each of my friends, some one after the other. Most were backstabbers and insecure with themselves. However, I kept 2 friends until January of 2008. One was my boyfriend at the time and the other was my best friend. They both betrayed me and for over a year now I have been totally alone. As I said, I was down and out for a little while. After about 3 months, I started looking at myself in the mirror each day and stated out loud what I loved about myself. My self-esteem took a huge step up. After about 6 months of being totally alone and not approached to date anyone, I realized that I was not lonely. I was just looking for someone other than myself to tell me I was good enough. Ever since I realized it, I need no one other than myself. If I want to feel loved, I just get out of the house and surround myself with positive people. Even though they do not love me, I sure do feel better. If I'm ever down and out, I sit and think about what I want and what I need. I analyze all of my feelings and afterwards I make goals to reach for, so that I can feel like I have accomplished something. I'm not sure if what I am typing to you is going to be great advice, but it worked for me. I wish you the best of luck in your pursuit of happiness!

God gives you love when he feels you are ready. you cannot find love if you are not prepared to accept it. you have to look in yourself and find the type of person you want to be with then you need to try to become that person as well because you cant expect someone to be great and wonderful and smart and pretty if you dont have something to back yourself up as well. the fact is is that God thinks/knows you are not ready. you are not in the right mind set to be in a relationship right now. and until you do get out of that mindset that everything is negative then you will stay alone. sorry if this was such a downer but ive come to realize that before, i was angry at the world because i was not feeling love and i felt alone as you do, then i read this poem that says <br>  "Everyone longs to give themselves completely to someone -- to have a deep soul relationship with another, to be loved thoroughly and exclusively. But God, to a Christian says, "No, not until you are satisfied and fulfulfilled and content with living loved by Me alone. I love you, my child, and until you discover that only in Me is your satisfaction to be found, you will not be capable of the perfect human relationship that I have planned for you. You will never be united with another until you are united with Me -- exclusive of anyone or anything else, exclusive of any other desires or longings. I want you to stop planning, stop wishing, and allow Me to give you the most thrilling plan existing -- one that you can't imagine. I want you to have the best. Please allow Me to bring it to you. Just keep experiencing that satisfaction knowing that I am. Keep learning and listening to the things I tell you... You must wait.<br>  <br>  Don't be anxious. Don't worry. Don't look around at the things others have gotten or that I've given to them. Don't look at the things you think you want. You just keep looking off and away up to Me, or you'll miss what I want to show you.<br>  <br>  And then, when you're ready, I'll surprise you with a love far more wonderful than any would ever dream. You see, until you are ready and until the one I have for you is ready, I am working even this very minute to have both of you ready at the same time. Until you are both satisfied exclusively with Me and with the life I have prepared for you, you won't be able to experience the love that exemplifies your relationship with Me...and this is perfect love.<br>  <br>  And dear one, I want you to have this most wonderful love, I want you to see in flesh a picture of your relationship with Me, and to enjoy materially and concretely the everlasting union of beauty and perfection and love that I offer you with Myself. Know that I love you utterly, I am God Almighty. Believe and be satisfied."<br>  <br>  <br>  be patient....love will find you|`|sPT8ikgXaa	You mention God twice, so I am assuming you may be religious/spiritual, at least somewhat.  With that being said, there is a season for everything.  When it is your time to have a girlfriend, then you will have one.  Everything happens in Gods timing, not yours.  I don't your age (or anything about you for that matter) but maybe God wants you to finish school first, or get a job or get other things in order and then a girlfriend will come.  And please do not be suicidal over not having a girlfriend...don't allow "having a girlfriend" to be your only reason to be happy and live.  That's silly.

It is the bond grown between people over a long time, a type of bond that is unbreakable, such as the one between you mom. That being said no one can truly "love" you like your mom or long time friends. Your friends became your best friends over a long period of time, which is what must be done with a lady friend, but with the extra step of relationship. Suicide is pointless and won't solve anything except making your mother so depressed she might want to commit suicide.

Depression may be caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain, and for some people, medication is the best way to right that imbalance.<br>  <br>  I have struggled with depression for years. A bad experience left me with severe PTSD, and I did attempt suicide. I wish I hadn't, it changed me forever. I still have thoughts, and when I do, I talk with my counselor immediately. <br>  <br>  If you don't feel comfortable talking to your conselor for whatever reason, pleas consider calling the below hotline:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.suicidepreventionlifeline.org...</a><br>  <br>  You are not alone. Maybe in a relationship sense, but not in a life experience sense. I have been through lonliness. I got married young, went through a rough patch, ended up separated from my husband. While we did reunite, and things are going well, I found myself in my deepest depression during my long months alone.<br>  <br>  Please, focus on the positive things in life. Having a future plan is what many psychologist refer to as "suicidal ideation." You think about how you'd do it if you'd do it. If you truly do have a strong relationship with God, talk to him, or a religious advisor in your life as well.<br>  <br>  Also, you cannot recieve happiness from someone until you truly understand how to find happiness on your own. It isn't fair to enter into a relationship and depend on that person to provide you with your happiness, to complete you. A good relationship involves two complete individuals who unite to created an even larger and more complete couple.<br>  <br>  Please talk to your counselor, or call the hotline.

Think of the positive side, You don't have to get into arguments, get bitched at all day ( We do that, lol) , Worry about how you are going to support your family, or worry about getting "in trouble" for going somewhere with the guys.    There are advantages also.   Why do you feel you need a women in your life? <br>  Besides when you stop looking you will find that Special person. Women like a man who is confident and does not seem vulnerable. You need to work on feeling confortable with yourself before you can truly love someone else or even find that "one"   Believe me you can't sit in your room depressed and meet her either.

Good luck!!!|`|c18386f9a325aea4ac9d4f2c92f5588baa	Let me start by saying I'm guessing you're still rather young, considering you have mentioned a school counselor. In other words, your time won't be up for a while, I would guess. And killing yourself is definitely not the answer. Please don't take death - or life - so lightly. <br>  <br>  Love takes time. It's not something that happens when you want it to. You could try going on a couple dates or hanging out in social areas. Love isn't always very easy to find, but you shouldn't lose hope just because of that. However, you do have to be patient. You'll find a special someone one day, but as to when, you won't have complete control over. Like I said before, though, you can try to mingle and find people you connect with, and eventually, you might find someone that can give you the love you want. <br>  <br>  Also, in the end, romantic love isn't all there is to life. As you said before, you have your mom, your friends, and your pet. It might not be enough for you, but nevertheless, it is already a lot, and you should definitely be thankful for that as well. Love will happen eventually, so while it's hard not to wonder when, you have to be patient. In the movies and the books, it happens just like that, but in reality, it sometimes takes a while to find true love. Don't wallow in your misery. Instead, try to enjoy the life you have now and know that love will most likely find you one day.|`|xdnZd7WBaa	hang in there!! things will get better, i promise you that.<br>  <br>  if you feel that suicidal, call crisis connection or go in to a clinic and ask to be admitted to a psych ward. they sound scary and bad, but i've been very suicidal and they helped me a lot. being away from life and having the support and encouragement to get better and find things to live for will really help you.<br>  <br>  if you ever need someone to talk to about this, just email me okay? no one should ever feel unwanted or lonely enough that they think life is not worth living. there is always something to keep going for.<br>  <br>  good luck <3|`|a2TniOJhaa	SO you believe in God the eternal father?

Yea well everyone told me to be patient too and 20 years later, still nothing... After my many gory suicide attempts that I regret dearly I had to get over it because I was only getting worse trying. But seriously you don't wanna go down that path because once you fail, you're screwed and it's not as easy as you may think trust me bro I been there. I was in coma for 2 years on my last attempt thinking for sure that this was it... NOPE!!! I wake up and can't remeber my name or anything I freaked out so bad I feinted and woke up days later drugged like a mofo chained to the bed. I was like WTF. <br>   <br>   For me it was depression. You may have it and not even know it, it's basically a chemical imbalance in the brain that can result in permanent brain damage if gone untreated for years like me. Not allot of people understand that it is very serious as most people joke about it which is just sad. Nothing really major happened to me or anything dramatic that I know of I lived a pretty normal life like most.

Well, I do too and suicide isn't the answer. I've been there, done that. Of course, I can understand from your situation that you are alone and depressed from not having someone to love and comfort you, but that time will come, there's no need to rush, it doesn't matter how old you are, or look, or anything, the right person will come along soon. I have been depressed all my life since growing up, and I was suicidal at one point in my life. I wanted what you wanted too, someone to love and spend the rest of my life with, well I waited and that day came, I am now happily married and have two kids. I know you are depressed and alone from not having what you truly desire, but time will come and you will find someone to love and hold, just hold on. Life is precious, and let me tell you, there is always someone out for anybody. If you hurt yourself, you will never get to experience that chance of having to love someone, to become father, a husband, a grandfather, or even hold your kids. Don't give up, there is someone out there for you.|`|WXi033Kxaa	I would say "don't worry about it", but seriously? Who can't?

Between the drama and breakup...<br>  I'll wait until people grow up a bit.<br>  <br>  Try to get closer to your friends maybe- either way.

When you try so hard to find it  and it does not appear, it feels like a piece of your heart dies.  You are a romantic.  Someone who has trumendous feelings inside and wants simply to find the right girl to share those feelings with.  I don't have a crystal ball but I can tell you this:  You will find love when you let the feeling of having to have it go.  Ask yourself this: If I were not to be in this world than why am I here.  You have a divine purpose and that divine woman you will find but it takes time.|`|ijeFuf7baa	I know a few people who have been seriously depressed but honestly suicide isnt the answer.

Any weight loss plan takes dedication. <br>  <br>  Running and cycling are very effective forms exercise without gaining too much muscle mass. The reason why they are so effective is because your leg muscles are your largest, which means they burn the most energy when they work. Another thing you have to watch while you exercise is your heart rate. There are wrist watches available that monitor your heart rate. I'd recommend getting one that continuously monitors it with the use of the chest strap. You could probably get a suitable one for $40-60. <br>  <br>  Whether you decide to run/jog or cycle, you want to stay at your target heart rate. The target heart rate is important.

Typically adolescents masturbate with the intention of reaching orgasm quickly, thus premature ejaculation has been “grooved” into your system. <br>  <br>  Now for the second reason, let’s face it we’d all like to be able to make love for hours.  There’s one problem though.  The body sees sex as a means to reproduce.  That said your body is going to try and reproduce as fast and efficiently as possible. This is why premature ejaculation mostly affects men in their teens and 20’s.The catch is, now you have to learn how to control it.  <br>  <br>  3.The third cause of premature ejaculation is the inability to handle and control intense arousal and sexual stimulation.  Once arousal reaches a certain tipping point it becomes almost impossible to hold back ejaculation.  <br>  <br>  In your pelvic region, various muscles come into play during the ejaculation process.  If you can identify those particular muscles and if you can use exercises to develop control over them then you can attain total ejaculation control. For controlling premature ejaculation focus on various emotions, thoughts and perceptions that are proven to cause premature ejaculation.<br>  There are some techniques like heart rate technique, breathing technique, training of glans, masturbation and sex techniques. You may find the detail on  website given in source|`|Nq4FWEIcaa	You are so horny you have a short ejaculation reflex.  You are experiencing premature ejaculation.

wr3CSJhMaa	You've had some extensive oral surgery done and by extracting 14 teeth there had to be some pulling of your lips and cheeks. It would've been nice if the dental assistant put some vaseline on the corner of your mouth before proceeding. Since you describe it to look like "blisters" it may just be herpes labialis from the stress of stretching and pulling your lips. It is normal for herpes labialis to be around the lips or corner of the mouth, but since it is spreading, you may want to go to your doctor or dentist to prescribe abreva or some other medication. This is just my best guess until confirmed by a dentist.

Whenever you feel depressed, which I'm guessing is at least partly because you feel lonely, it might be good to surround yourself with people you care about. Call up a few friends and spend some time with them. If no one is available, try doing something you really enjoy to distract yourself. Indulge yourself. Sometimes, depression can make it so that you don't want to do a single thing and you feel like you can't do a single thing, but you have to try or else drown in your misery. <br>  <br>  I've never been in a long distance relationship - or any serious relationship, to be honest - but I do feel depressed at times, and I know that the best thing is simply to keep a positive outlook on things. It's not easy, for sure, but it really is helpful. Talking with a friend, particularly one who knows how it feels, always helps me as well, and it might be helpful for you. The most important thing is simply not to wallow. The more time you spend in a depressed state, the worse it gets, especially if you stay put in your misery. Distract yourself and cheer yourself up again. Know that things will work out eventually and just keep on going.|`|51HWwSlwaa	Sure you are feeling depressed anyone would to.

That's awesome, good for you!<br>  Ok, well the thing that really popped out at me was the diet soda. Yeah, it's diet, but it's still not good for you. I think a healthier substitute could be natural orange juice or homemade lemonade. The soda has a bunch of empty calories that help you in no way. Just an idea..<br>  Also, omg great job on the gallon of water.. omg i'm lucky if I can drink 5 glasses a day =/ it's soo hard! =)<br>  I think maybe you need to eat more fruits and vegetables?<br>  Something that both my mom and I have done is made vegetable juice in a juicer and drinking it at least a few times a week.. It's really gross. We would usually put in it carrots, celery, cucumber, spinach, beets, etc.. It's really healthy and good for you and much easier than eating the yucky vegetables.. ok it takes some time to make the juice, but so worth it! She went on a diet where she drank juice every day, sometimes more than once a day, and she was losing about 3lbs per week, which is good and healthy.<br>  Also, make sure you eat a lot of fiber.. you can try eating Fiber One cereal. I really like it and eat it by itself as a snack.. you can add it to any cereal and it has over half of the ideal amount of fiber you should consume each day.<br>  I recommend some weight training to build some muscle, after all muscle helps burn fat.<br>  Also, make sure that even though you are trying not too eat too many calories, that you don't starve yourself.. it doesn't help you in the long run.<br>  That's all I can think of.. good job though.. it takes a while to reach your goal weight. Congrats and good luck =)|`|zSkC7hsGaa	The time I plataued i was prepping for a bodybuilding contest, I went out, had the biggest hamberger I could find with all the fixins .The next day I had lost 2 lbs.

You are eating too much rubbish and not enough real food, and not enough good protein, complex carbs and vegetables.<br>  <br>  If you want your liver to burn fat you have to give it what it requires, and yes you probably DO need to cleanse and detoxify it. This means a normal healthy diet, not a trendy style detox.<br>  <br>  Read these articles below and you will see why I'm telling you this. It gives you an example diet to follow that allows you to eat better and lose weight. This diet was originally written by a doctor.|`|3EcjCux4aa	I'm not sure how really representative your stated diet is, but let's talk about a holistic approach.<br>  First, you appear to be getting the majority of your calories from carbs, adding more protein will preserve your muscle mass and help you burn more calories.  Your breakfast is particularly bad for losing weight.  In the morning, your body is running exclusively on fat reserves.  Once you add carbs, you body shifts to those, and refills the fat stores.  Get some good protein (eggs!) first thing in the morning, and if you want some carbs, then oatmeal has the lowest glycemic index of any carb, and takes the longest to break down.  If you want it sweet, then add some dried fruit, but stay away from sugar.<br>  This is probably why you have plateaued.  You just aren't giving your body what it needs. I'd also hope that you are taking a good food based vitamin supplement pack, because you're not getting what you need from what you posted.<br>  For a good "diet", check out Ori Hoefmekler's"Warrior Diet", it is a science based eating program that is actually based on human metabolism, and not some fad.<br>  Second, running is not good exercise for most people.  It is hard on the joints and steady state aerobics lower your anabolic response, so you'll break down the muscle you have, and store fat.<br>  The best way to lose weight and obtain optimal health is with a good weight training program and circuit training.  Make sure you get plenty of rest (too little sleep increases cortisol and causes you to get fat), and feed you beody with high quality fresh food.|`|WzhRf9ADaa	Hi I'm 21 and I've lost the same amount of weight too..I do calorie zig zagging when I hit a plateau. Over time our bodies adapt to the lowered calorie level. Our body becomes more efficient at using energy (lowered metabolism), and therefore burns less fat.<br>  <br>  Example:<br>  <br>  Monday - 1000 calories<br>  Tuesday - 1375 cals<br>  Wednesday - 1750 cals<br>  Thursday - 1125 cals<br>  Friday - 1000 cals<br>  <br>  And repeat, Works like a charm!|`|kdXTunqgaa	A great way to overcome a plateau is to have one meal that is high in carbohydrates and something that you havent eaten for a while. Sometimes the body gets use to being fed the same food day in day out when you are dieting and it needs a shock to kick start the weightloss again.  When I plateaud, the next week I had a Subway roll with grilled chicken for my high carb meal and two nights I had grilled fish and veges for dinner and then I got a great loss.<br>  My friends and I are doing weightlosssecret.info which is 3 meals a day and no snacks.

The reason most people gain weight after or even during their diets is due to their mindset that this isjust a temporary thing. When you change your way of life, results will come faster and easier than you will expect. 1) Do NOT starve yourself. this might cause you to lose a lot of weight at first, but sooner or later youre gonna break down and splurge, thats human nature. Instead eat small meals throughout the day, your heavier fats and carbs in the morning, allowing you to burn them off during the day. 2) Avoid "bad" carbs. Fast digesting carbs, such as those from white bread, potatos, and rice almost instantly burn up into fat unless you eat them before rigorous activity, which is why athletes eat them before competitions. Instead try brown rice, a healthier slow digesting carb that actually tastes pretty darn good. And eat sweet potatos, another slow digesting carb. Also maintain an exercise routine and results will come with time.|`|kdXTunqgaa	My friends and I are following weightlosssecret.info. I have lost 8 kilos now since December.

AtjlmByAaa	Hi, weight-loss programs have been with us for years, yet even those designed by the best-trained professionals fail. Is weight really what the person wants to lose? It's not weight that we need to lose, it's fat. While weight-loss and fat loss may seem synonymous to you, it's the people who concentrate on fat loss who are successful. Fat is lost from the body almost exclusively by being burned in muscle. You can't melt off fat in saunas, steam baths, or plastic wraps. You can't dissolve fat with a grapefruit diet, lecithin, or any food supplement. fat is released from storage sites into the blood to be carried to muscles. If the muscles don't burn the fat, it returns via the blood to be stored again in another fat depot.The big fault in most weight-loss schemes is that some of the lost pounds are muscle, making the victim's body increasingly unable to burn fat. If you eat the right diet while exercising regularly, you will lose fat as you increase your ability to burn it. Remember exercise builds muscle; more muscle burns more fat; less fat makes it easier to exercise...Good luck|`|vEGkSHMsaa	Perhaps look at your dvds and start doing them??

Believe me, you have been screwed over and you are totally right to be having trouble. If you decide not to go to child services, at least know that you're almost done, you're almost 18; then you can get out of there for ever.<br>  <br>  Email me, OK? I promise I won't mind. <br>  kalibasa1@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  If it makes you feel any better, I'm borderline, bulimic, bipolar and I was alcoholic.

Or look up counseling centres and self help groups in your area. Go and talk to them all until you find someone who can give you the Information you need to get help.<br>  <br>  <br>  If you are in the Uk go and see your doctor or check in your local library for local support groups.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of people who are paid to deal with situations like this. You just have to find them. You have been very strong up to now and you can get stronger with the right kind of help.<br>  <br>  Good luck sweetheart.|`|eMPeOsRBaa	jesus christ. we're similar in a lot of ways.<br>  i want to help you but i'd feel more comfortable if it wasn't so public.<br>  you can e-mail me at anabelle.fray@yahoo.com if you want to.|`|5jQVj4Pfaa	Sounds like you're being emotionally abused by your parents and like the family is completely dysfunctional, sorry to say. Unless you want to get the authorities involved and be taken away from them or possibly get early emancipation from them at 17, there's really nothing to do except wait until you're 18 and can just up and leave completely legally. It'll be difficult, obviously, but there's really nothing else I can say on the matter. My friend is going through similar problems, and after talking for a few hours, she, our best friend, and I came up with the fact that there's nothing she can really do but wait 'til she's 18 in the next year. After that, we don't really know what we can do for her or if she'll be able to make it on her own, but it's better than dying because that solves nothing, leaves more problems, and causes pain in the long run and potentially suicide attempts by those terribly affected. Seeing as your mom has already tried 4 times, I'd only suggest being careful and making the right decisions now that you didn't before when you were doing drugs. Confide in a school counselor or perhaps get outside help.|`|XPdXlkc8aa	Look man, I know it seems bad now but it'll get better, I've hasd anxiety sinse 7th grade and I'm in 10th now, I also just got diagnosedwithbipolar disorder, I feel mean and happy, weird I know but this is how it works, if u need to talk, e mail me at es_vato_loco@yahoo.com|`|rfboTBTWaa	Sounds just like me.

Defend your brother, be self-sufficient, and get prepared to fly out of that house on your 18th birthday. Be a role model for your brother and encourage him to do the same. Get an apartment together, SOMETHING. <br>  <br>  Try not to go back to your bad habits,  cause with that toxic environment, they'll be explosive. They may eat you alive before you ever get out.

In my experience, the young kids who knew the deceased don't understand and so it is very hard for them to cry [unless their parents are crying]. the age group that has the hardest time dealing with these tragedies, in my opinion, are the preteens and teens. this age group already has so much going on around them and inside of them. they are beginning to think about what happens before death, during the dieing process, and after death. it's very confusing for everyone, however it seems like it hits these people more often. are you in this age group?|`|ca2539c525ddc6c1e54324614f643771aa	Some people grieve in different ways.

aiH9WmnKaa	Boost Your Sex Power - Natural Ways<br>  <br>  If your sexual tempo is decreased after sunny summer days do not be anxious! This is totally normal. You will find a few recommendations and a special formula for men to overcome these hard days on the next lines.<br>  <br>  According to mythology, love goddess Aphrodite was known by her own formulated preparations and ointments that she gives to her lovers to increase their sexual power. This is the reason of why today we are calling all stimulating elixirs as aphrodisiacs. Nowadays men are not such lucky and we highly recommend to read this article to men who live in big cities.<br>  <br>  Without doubt best aphrodisiacs are Sun, a good sleep and fresh air. A good sleep is necessary for the body to pack itself up, to increase its energy and revitalize its hormones. Sun light is a powerful doping for our body including sexual hormones. The main reason of men's vitality in holidays is being relaxed in fresh air. But in Autumn's cloudy days some natural reinforcements may help a lot.<br>  <br>  Magical power of foods:<br>  <br>  Basil, clove, ginger, onion, tomato, radish, celery, egg, carrot, red pepper, oats, asparagus, fresh onion, chestnut, hazelnut, pistachio nut, coconut, cucumber, oyster, caviar are main foods to improve your sexual power. Having them in your weekly menu selections would be a wise choice. Specially, foods containing vitamin E like pistachio, almond, hazelnut and walnut are natural drugs for impotence and erectile disorders.<br>  <br>  Red is good for men's vitality:<br>  <br>  When we say aphrodisiacs we generally mean drugs for men because they must be active in sexual relationships. In other words, for a successful lovemaking they must be aroused and erected. For a man vigor red color is important. In astrology Mars represents man and its sexual power, and Mars's color symbol is red. So, red colored foods and drinks are recommended for man's arousal. For example red pepper, red ginseng...<br>  <br>  A man who is always wearing pale, pastel or dark colored dresses may get less excitations. Maybe this is the reason of using red lights, red under wares, red bed sheets... to create an erotic environment. Red coral or ruby stone are also good for increasing man's energy.<br>  <br>  Women who feel sexually less active may also profit from red color and stones. But the must important aphrodisiacs for a woman is love and affection added into lovemaking.<br>  <br>  As vegetal aphrodisiacs, vitamins are very helpful for a successful sex life. Specially vitamin E is vital for men. Beside pills you can get vitamin E through natural foods and specially hazelnut contains many minerals and essential fat acids. To overcome the fatigue syndrome due to modern life and high technology, vitamin B is also indispensable.<br>  <br>  Avoid depression:<br>  <br>  Remember that behind sexual troubles, many hormonal and nourishing disorders, and heavy depressions may exist. Also, after a serious depression or a nutrition disorder only a treatment of natural mixtures may not be sufficient, in such cases help of a psychiatrist (sexologist) or nutrition expert is needed.<br>  <br>  Heavy training may be harmful:<br>  <br>  For a healthy sexual life a light and not tiring training program is as important as vegetal aphrodisiacs. A light and regular exercise program will balance your metabolism and hormonal system to keep you sexually active. But beware of heavy and tiring training programs because an extra low fat texture may cause a performance decrease.<br>  <br>  Yoga, meditation and many other positive energy techniques are recommended to purify your brain against stress and support sexual energy. Right breathing exercises are also important for a successful sex life. If you insist for heavy training please pay special attention for a regular and healthy nutrition.<br>  <br>  A Special Booster Formula for Men:<br>  <br>  Put 1 kg. of a good quality flower honey into a glass pot, add 250 gr. powdered ginger, 100 gr. powdered Indian saffron, 50 gr. peeled and pounded green cardamom, 1 gr. saffron, 5 gr. pounded coriander, 4 sweet spoons of pounded stinging nettle seeds, 2 sweet spoons of royal jelly, 4 sweet spoonful of pollen, 100 gr. unshelled and pounded pistachio nut and 100 gr. of pine nut. Stir and mix the whole with a wood spoon. You can store the pot in a cool and gloomy place. If you don't have any allergy or illness against those ingredients, eat one tablespoon 2 times (morning and night) in a day.|`|3gPLONagaa	Love is the only natural way to enhancing sex!|`|Gj5WkwG4aa	Use more Grow more.<br>  Use healthy Grow healthy.<br>  Use in diversified ways Grow in diversified diseases.<br>  Use in one way with full Love Grow the same way strong.<br>  <br>  Understand!!! ???

sessNZ7zaa	Shaving with a razor would probably be the least painful option as long as you are REALLY careful, however the re-growth causes lots of irritation. I think although waxing will be painful at first you wont have weeks of discomfort from itchy re-growth or shaving rashes as you would from razor shaving!|`|8jBGhsWPaa	There are a few things you can do to remove unwanted hair. You can buy wax stripes from chemists and pharmacys or get it professionally done with hot wax but this is quite painful, You can use hair removable cream which doesnt hurt atall or you can shave which is also painless and easy to do, however shaving doesnt last as long as wax and hair removal cream as it doesnt remove the roots but just cuts them. Wax and hair removal takes away the roots leaving you silky smooth for around 1 month.|`|fzDMcYu3aa	I would say you could try shaving but it would be better to wax. It may hurt but it will be worth it!|`|QRbCnBgFaa	Hi, use disposable razors. The ones you can throw away after use, because you can only imagine how un-hygienic it would be to use `em again. Use ones which have double or even triple blade, they're safer and won't cut your skin.<br>  It's less painful than waxing and quicker than cream.<br>  It helps if you rub shaving cream or baby oil, so that your skin is moisturized and can be shaved easily.<br>  <br>  There are some bad things about using razors,though. You might cut yourself. And the hair grows back thicker and quicker. And it can cause a lot of irritation and you can get problems like ingrowing hair, where the hair curls back and starts growing inside your skin. And it might be embarrasing,too if your going school because when hair starts to grow you get scratchy down there and you would have to resist not scratching it. Anyway, if you use razors safely, and shave your pubic hair regularly then it won't be a problem.<br>  <br>  :-)|`|vjqXsVRnaa	Hi<br>  I know waxing sounds like (hell) and to be honest the first time it is <br>  But you don't have to do it again for weeks <br>  shaving is fine but you have to be prepared to do it every day <br>  my best advise (what I do ) is get waxed then as the soft hairs grow back I use depletion cream until they become to thick again so it gives me about 14 weeks between waxing or 4 times a year and it does get less painful each time you go (honest)<br>  <br>  Jill X|`|brSfRLspaa	shave it, simple and painless|`|JhJs2cnmaa	Shaving or hair removal cream is painless but grows back very quickly and is VERY itchy when it does grow back!

Pre-stretching the sphincter muscle by insertion of a medium sized well-lubricated dildo. Do this for at least a week or more prior to anal sex;<br>  <br>  2. Self-administering an enema consisting of plain warm water [without any laxative] via a hot water bottle to wash out all fecal matter from within the rectum; stop administering when the expelled water appears clear. Do this about 2-3 hours prior to the act;<br>  <br>  3. Asking your bf to shave along the shaft of his organ in order to remove any hair. No hair allows smoother entry of the organ. <br>  <br>  4. Using a lot of lubricant [K-Y] on the male organ;<br>  <br>  5. Engaging in the doggie position, where you are on your hands and knees and he enter from atop;<br>  <br>  6. Using a condom is optional since you are basically very clean inside your rectum and should you engage in oral sex immediately after he climaxes in your anal passageway; use an antiseptic/alcohol wipe on his organ before continuing oral sex.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0TT5q0cUaa	The chances of HIV infection through oral sex are low but certainly an element of risk exists. There is no way that anybody can tell you whether you did or did not get infection without testing. The usual tests (ELISA) do not begin to get positive even if infection is present for 6 weeks to 12 weeks after exposure. The chances of HIV infection by kisses, even deep or wet kisses is very very low though again it is not an activity with No risk. Small amounts of blood in the saliva need not be visible. Testing for HIV once a month is without any meaning for many reasons including the fact that tests do not show up as positive early after infection and in any case the person could get infected the day after the test!<br>  <br>  The anus and rectum are home to the residue of the digestive system - faeces, bacteria, and viruses.

You pick up a piece of bread right now!!!!!! <br>  Listen young lady, not eating wont help you lose weight but it will help you die! Eat small portions, eat a banana, just eat something!!!!<br>  If you want to lose weight then work out and watch what you eat.<br>  <br>  And if thats hard, then work ur way up. Start making small changes. Like, switch from pop to only drinking water. Instead of taking a bus, an elevator, getting a rider - WALK. Do a few workouts on the floor, run around ur house... but dont you dare not eat!!!!!!!!!!!|`|47zYFRQXaa	Not eating in order to achieve a "nice body" isn't healthy at all. Seriously, I have a friend who is going through that right now. And because she starved herself so much she has a bunch of health problems. For example, she's not allowed to exercise because she might have a heart attack because her heart is so weak.  <br>     Instead, change your diet. People don't realize just how much a persons diet effects their weight. Start eating more natural things rather than foods that are processed and have lots of artificial ingredients. It will really make a difference. <br>     And finally, exercise! Even if it's the difference between walking up rather than taking the elevator. It may not feel effective but it actually is. So even just small things like that will help. But you could also go to the gym, run or take long walks. Just do something you love to do that also gets you in better shape. <br>     But also, try not to let people get to you. Other people should never be able to decide what pretty or beautiful is for another person. Everyone is different and everyone has different body types and people need to learn to respect that. You also need to love yourself for who you are- even things you can't help or change. Confidence is key.<br>        Good luck!

While most women of child-bearing age (about 80 percent) have some symptoms of PMS,[1] the official definition limits the scope to having symptoms of "sufficient severity to interfere with some aspects of life".[2] Such symptoms are usually predictable and occur regularly during the two weeks prior to menses. Generally, symptoms may vanish both before or after the start of menstrual flow.<br>  <br>  While some experts claim that virtually all menstruating women experience PMS, a more recent and intermediate position shows that a only small percentage of women (2 to 5%) have significant premenstrual symptoms that are separate from the discomfort associated with menstruation.[3]<br>  <br>  For some women with PMS, the symptoms are so severe that they are considered disabling. This form of PMS has its own psychiatric designation: premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).<br>  <br>  Culturally, the abbreviation PMS is widely understood in the United States (and other countries, for example Australia) to refer to difficulties associated with menses, and the abbreviation is used frequently even in casual and colloquial settings, without regard to medical rigor. In these contexts, the syndrome is rarely referred to without abbreviation, and the connotations of the reference are frequently more broad than the clinical definition.|`|8TmK8Qklaa	Psychotic Mood Satan|`|2259822f0cd7ff32d9ffac0f2a824a63aa	Pre Menstrual Syndrome.<br>  Not to be confused with CMS (Constant Menstrual Syndrome...)|`|i7axq25Maa	Pre Menstrual Syndrome|`|980cd82a18459010574ced1a4cc818f1aa	It means Pre Menstrual Syndrome|`|k5FJjAFqaa	pre menstrual syndrom|`|5wqC08Zwaa	pre-menstrual syndrome...at least i think so...|`|tNAeZowCaa	PMS stands for Pre-Menstrual Syndrome.

Because the symptoms begin before the menstrual period starts, they are called “pre”-menstrual. Because there is a specific set of symptoms, the condition is called a “syndrome.” Symptoms of PMS may include weight gain, fluid retention, sudden mood swings, irritability and fatigue. If you’re concerned that PMS may be affecting you, I’d suggest you read more about it and/or discuss it with your doctor.

3qa3BftUaa	Don't worry. The results normally take about six weeks. They should arrive any time from now. This is normal length of time to wait for results.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	Usually if all is normal they will send you a little thing in the mail saying so and to call to schedule your annual again if not already did so. They will call about a week or two weeks after the smear to bring you back in to talk to you if it was abnormal. You can always feel free to call the office and see if they got the results back. Most places are very nice and helpful with offering the information to you.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you.....|`|Fuej6dMPaa	my gyno always mailed the results, it usually took about 2 or 3 weeks. the one time it came back abnormal i already had a follow up apt scheduled so he just told me then, which again was like 2 weeks after my pap smear|`|G3Xf0i0Eaa	How did they tell you that you'd get the results?<br>  <br>  Maybe you had to book an appointment to see the doc about them or something? Or go in to collect them?|`|egERu5toaa	usually if they dont call you or get ahold of you or anything, it means that your fine, and everythings clear and thres nothign to worry about.|`|JKM7CEpnaa	No news is good news. If your still worried give the doctors office a call. I think your test was negative and your cervix is healthy.|`|9cba094486c6e7ab49a59ac5ea44682faa	In the UK, smear test results usually take between 2-3 weeks. Ring up your surgery and ask if they have received the results. If everything is normal, they may not even call you. Late results do not = bad news necessarily.
nbWO3IANaa	You probably pulled a muscle from coughing.<br>  Add some ibuprofen or Tylenol to your meds. If it still hurts a LOT, then call the doc.|`|5ypdHLtGaa	it sounds to me like you  pulled a muscle in your side while you were coughing. try to stretch it out and put some ice on it for a day or two and then switch to heat. if it doesn't get better after a week then go back to the doctor. i would continue on the meds.|`|DwFnqLydaa	You should call your doctor and tell him, or go to the ER.  You might be having a bad reaction to the medications.  It could be nothing, but probably not if it REALLY hurts.|`|1bGlSPX9aa	It is the Cold and Flu season. Try not to be in cold, wet, or damp weather. Take a hot bath at night and invest in a home air system.|`|p7AT6tDsaa	You may have an appendix that is infected and has spread to your lungs or vice versa.  You need to seek immediate medical attention.  If it ruptures you could die.|`|1Pbb7AzAaa	Hun, see a doctor! that sounds really serious!
AA10500703	Not to sound mean, but I think you need to post your question in the dating and relationship section.
6XK3JizYaa	lol i am 29 and i shave, have for years and not because my husband prefers it but because it is much cleaner...but yeah i have all of the above things you mentioned and it is because of poly cystic ovarian syndrome. you should see a dr about checking your hormone levels. i have take birth control pills to help keep my hormones in check. good luck and i hope this helps.|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	Many women start getting hair where they don't want it...I think it's another way we are tortured!!  lol...<br>  Seriously though - I think a lot of us out there would agree that they noticed the same thing the older they got.<br>  P.S...I back you up on the shaving thing!!  Men are supposed to be hairy...not women!|`|ZF8zu2ehaa	Eh I suggest waxing, you have to shave a lot more often. I got those hairs around 15 years of age. It's embarassing and most guys don't like it. But whatever your comfortable with should be enough. Good luck girl :D|`|VHDXQhY6aa	honestly, i would LOVE to tell you it's a simple hormone imbalance, but things will continue to change a little more over probably the next 2-3 years...you're becoming a woman, not hitting puberty, finishing puberty...it really sucks, and it makes you feel a bit gross, but you can't avoid it.  your hips might widen too.  i didn't get the linea nigra, but i got more hair in other places and i hated it!! but the good news is you might be lucky enough to have one last growth spurt like i did, and more good news is if you think your boobs are too small, they might get as big as 1-2 more cup sizes.|`|UfkOQsE2aa	Whatever you do, don't shave it!   You're not a little 9 y/o girl anymore!  :)<br>  <br>  Yeah, it seems its the "in" thing to do.  I prefer it natural or if you must, just trim!<br>  <br>  As for me, I shave/trim to make it look bigger!<br>  <br>  LOL, yeah, I think it works at bit at least.  I'm below average!|`|hXQjnPuGaa	I have a few hairs around my nipples, and so do most of the women in my family.<br>  I also got a little hairier as I got older.<br>  I think it's normal, as long as you're not completely covered. <br>  Just shave it off, wax it or tweeze it.|`|7DY3fCdraa	get  FSH/LH and tsh and prolactin levels  done on ya blood<br>  certain disorders can cause hair to grow on breast and chin ,etc...<br>  polycystic ovarys are common causes,ie,hormone imbalance....good luck

How can it hurt, it feels soo good.|`|qwHAAvC6aa	i think they are. i havent heard that its bad.
FaVYRoXqaa	not specifically.  Being healthy makes you look younger.|`|xywgBurHaa	Yep !!<br>  <br>  How old are you ??|`|N9nJWYa5aa	I'm told I look much younger than I am, some of my old school friends are amazed by how much younger I look than they do.  Shame that I'm still ugly as sin!
o9p5kn1Baa	I think the elliptical would be the better option also, it targets your core and your moving your whole body  instead of sitting|`|2724e8c32a9de71dca3f16697d9d6ebbaa	Elliptical because it burns more calories and is a better overall workout.
l5cxmTb9aa	Long answer: You don't say how old you are or whether you do anything strenuous.<br>  As long as you're not obese or in danger of having a blood clot it's probably just a temporary thing.<br>  I once had some heinous bruises on both upper calves that worried me until I noticed that I was forcing my calves under the the seat of my work chair with my toes on top of the base. Nervous energy would cause me to push down with my toes hard enough to make the bruises. Just be aware of anything you might be doing to aggravate it. and if it gets worse or doesn't go away in 4 days see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Short answer: You're getting older. Get used to it. ;)|`|wbZp6ZcPaa	could be a weird charlie horse. Try eating a banana.

EoroQbCraa	Daily headaches are very abnormal.  I have been having them for about two weeks straight, and it is thought that it's either a brain tumor or some kind of unnoticed hemorrhagic brain tremor/trauma.  Plus, they are accompanied with stiff necks and dizziness spells and weakness and etc.  I'm fourteen years old.  Especially since she is three, I would take her in ASAP...and not wait for her normal doctor check-up.  I truly wish you and her the very best of luck!  You guys will be in my prayers!<br>  <br>  PS.  I hope she gets better soon!|`|ur1bnkrZaa	ive never heard of a baby with headaches!<br>  thats not normal if there occuring everyday.<br>  go to the doctor.|`|YuV4bgyLaa	No.  Daily headaches are abnormal for anyone, much less a child.  If this has been going on for a while, she needs to see a doctor who may recommend an MRI.  Personally, I would take her in sooner.<br>  It could be something as simple as allergies, or a tooth problem, or as serious as unnoticed head trauma.|`|AA11767076	I would be concerned to wait for the appointment.<br>  <br>  Maybe she just has growing pains or has heard the info. and is repeating it, but at that age, it is really hard to tell what exactly going on by communicating.<br>  <br>  You should take her to the Dr. just to ensure that nothing medical is going on.|`|Y616lKjwaa	I would book a apointment with the doctor tomorrow, <br>  <br>  I usaly get headaces when I need a drink (water)<br>  <br>  But please take her to the Dr.'s

I'm a type 2 diabetic that has to limit intake of carbs and thought that others might benefit from my research.  I have a special section just for low carb snacks.  Not all of them are low calorie, but many of them will fall under your 150 calorie requirement if you stay under the recommended serving size.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|wXKs94nDaa	1. boiled egg<br>  2. crackers <br>  3. 2 small sausages <br>  4. tuna|`|1YEtUVHnaa	100 calorie snacks which can be found at the store<br>  tuna<br>  any type of healthy protein<br>  apple<br>  almonds
T3b1Mq3saa	On the website of Fitness Magazine you can find a variety of work outs. Also, there you can create your own personalized work out and food menu. They have videos and offer so many advices on how to stay healthy and work out efficiently. <br>  <br>  My advice, when it comes to loosing weight is, decrease your portions and eat healthy food. Never stay hungry and get enough rest because those are the times when you are more likely to snack too much or eat unhealthy.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	TRY THIS, and stick to it.<br>  <br>  the first 3-4 weeks are the hardest until your boy adjusts to the change.<br>  Results will be in about the same time<br>  <br>  Fruits and Veggies<br>  <br>  Eat more plants and keep away from stuff that was made in plants.<br>  don't eat anything that comes in a can, box or package...THEY HAVE ADDITIVES IN THEM THAT MAKE YOU ADDICTED TO THE FOOD<br>  <br>  Stay away from FAST FOOD<br>  <br>  Don't think of it as a diet, but think of it as a lifestyle change<br>  <br>  I have lost 25.5 pounds in 2 months, drink lots of water. I usually eat a meal of what ever I want once a week....controlled portion....this really works.........<br>  <br>  Write down every thing you eat|`|9sO0vXROaa	okay well not to be mean but for your height you are a bit heavy.but you can loose it!!!! Keep the gym thing going on a consistent basis.maybe like 3-5 times week for about 1-2 hours.eat organic foods like,f fruit, veggies, chicken, tuna, anything but processed food!!! and stay away from sugars!!!! do crunches..maybe 8 reps of 2 at a time..morning afternoon and night..do side crunches also it helps!
gfHutvEFaa	You have DUB. Dysfunctional Uterine Bleeding.<br>  <br>  Why did you wait so long to see a doctor. That many tampons and pads is NOT NORMAL.<br>  <br>  Go to ER.|`|bJnLmvkqaa	I'm sorry. Your story is just unbelievable! If you're really bleeding that much go to the emergency room.|`|VuBbFcBSaa	I think that you should go to ER asap.you should try taking midol or motrin to ease the pain.But i think that you should just do to the emergency.Becaus this sound like something more this your period|`|7xrqZ5jTaa	it could be somehting that runs in the family,<br>  im 13 and one of my frineds get extremly heavy period for 2 weeks, she has to change her tampon every 10 minutes or soo, there is a sergury option i think its called a histerectimy, my mates mum had her problem and had this done, it takes a part of your womb out to stop your peroids howwever you wont be able to have any children.|`|VHDXQhY6aa	funny how my story is unbelieveable too...i had a cyst the size of a nerf football, gained 25 pounds in a year that i couldn't lose, had pain all the time and a uterus as big as if i were 4 months pregnant and no one could seem to find anything wrong.  i had an irregular period and an endometrioma and endometriosis, and i was told i was a faker when i had a period for 2 weeks straight, and my doc didn't believe me and wouldn't see me immediately...it wasn't until i got a new doctor and lied my way to a specialist by saying i was trying for a baby and couldn't get pregnant that they found this cyst.  so sue?  sounds like you've always been miss regularity and can't understand people who haven't been regular a day in their life!!!<br>  <br>  ok, now after that rant...you need to go to the er, talk to them, tell them you can't stand the pain, don't wait.  now when this is resolved, to figure out what it is, tell them you want to have a baby, and with all this irregularity that even though you've tried for a year nothing worked.  channel your stress about this and tell them you want a baby, because they will jump through HOOPS to figure it out for you, i had problems since i was 13 too and they just put me on the pill, that's all they did, and my new doc, a specialist, told me that i had had this likely since i was 13 by the size and growth rate, and no one ever paid attention.  remember, you are now old enough to demand to be listened to.  you are not 13 anymore and they won't just stick you on the pill.
8SRjELNBaa	That would be working on your obliques.|`|1tjJPHpMaa	those are caused by pants that are a size or 2 too small. the only exercise that does anything for them is running

There are lots of opportunities to fail in the big wide world aren't there?! The only thing which clearly delivered for me is wu-yi tea, it can be viewed in the resource box below, they have a small number of free trials remaining, it was reported in Reader's Digest and CNN. I melted away 20 pounds, it clearly does produce results!|`|HAymR7OQaa	Weight Watchers its great and it works
fyXTjMQdaa	Good job!<br>  Usually I'll do maybe 5.5 for a little, and then lower it to keep myself going so I don't pass out. xD|`|O6CO6mKgaa	yes it is very good!
4ZE8RG7Waa	yes!me and my boyfriend used to pass it back n forth so it is important he gets some canesten cream(thrush cream can get at chemist)to apply to the penis... so either use a condom or refrain from sex!if you have had sex last few days he will certainaly have it too...|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Yes, you certainly can pass it on.  Get your silly butt to a doctor and get treated before you have sex!|`|8HDQMkSBaa	Yupe.....You need to tell him
Z4pj79fDaa	before and after!<br>  Food is fuel, and it's important to eat at least something prior to a workout. Eat something like a fruit after a workout. <br>  <br>  Allow enough time to digest.<br>  Allow 3 - 4 hours for a big meal to digest, 2 - 3 hours for a small meal, and an hour or less for a small snack, depending on your body.<br>  Avoid high fat proteins.<br>  Peanut butter, red meat, and cheese, for example, take longer to digest and often add to feelings of fatigue.<br>  Eat for the duration of your workout.<br>  If you are going to exercise for less than an hour, you'll simply need foods that digest easily. Choose high-carb, low fat foods, such as crackers, bagels, or bread. If you are going to exercise for longer than an hour, choose carbohydrates that last longer, such as yogurt or a banana.<br>  Drink plenty of fluids.<br>  Dehydration is a common source of an unpleasant workout.|`|6b7KFgtpaa	Assuming you have a normal diet and your glycogen levels are where they need to be, (and it's not an endurance workout) I don't believe it really matters on a biochemical level.  My personal preference is to eat after in order to avoid stomach aches or even vomiting during intense workouts.  Most people and websites recommend you eat after.  I recommend just remembering to include a decent amount of protein in your post workout meal is most important in order for your muscles to repair.  Eat carbs a few hours before any endurance workouts.|`|RlsLlggPaa	It is is advisable to eat some protein and complex carbs a couple of hours before and then plenty of protein soon after your workout.|`|7vKeZYcYaa	After because your metabolism is up|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	Eat about 1.5 hrs before workout if its complex carbohydrates <br>  half an hour before a workout, if its simple carbohydrates, like sugars n starches. After workout don't eat anything till about 1-1.5 hrs later.|`|22c62deec8de00bc570cec69eda38a6caa	BOTH!<br>  <br>  You need good calories to burn off too. So a couple of hours before try eating something light and with proteins.
yIYWhQeFaa	Any exercise done with light or NO extra weights, and then the trick is to do more reps of those exercises.  You will build some muscle, but your body will automatically burn more calories all the time, once you have a routine down.  Walking is great - get yourself a dog or borrow one it'll be less boring, yoga, OR try building up your arms & core then that calorie burning theory above might trim down your legs!|`|GHNYmp3baa	running, it will help with evrything :)|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Cycling is one of the best.|`|hSOEgpPNaa	Your legs will look ugly without muscle|`|AA12208063	If you are talking about losing fat in your legs, there's no way to spot reduce. You can lose weight in general, but it will come off where it wants, and that's a function of genetics. So the best way to make your legs smaller is to lose weight and some of that fat will come off your legs.|`|qQCbP6pKaa	Not possible, If you exercise you will gain muscle. Its almost like asking who do I lift weight without getting stronger. The purpose of exercise is to build muscle, gain strength and health.<br>  <a href="http://www.charleslloydfitness.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.charleslloydfitness.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com/" rel="nofollow">http://blog.charleslloydfitness.com/</a>|`|PKVKpzDdaa	Walking, Running, Yoga, Pilates those are all great for losing all over weight and making you have great legs and butt.. Also I found the Eliptical machine works GREAT! Better than a treadmill..|`|cYyJZS11aa	Pilates
mMGQCGMsaa	You could have an ovarian cyst or endometriosis.  You should go to the ER.  Blessings.|`|t5T8urrtaa	No<br>  You should go to the emergency room|`|hswTS1jVaa	No. That does not sound like ovulation at all. <br>  <br>  You should go to a doctor if you are in that much pain!<br>  <br>  Also, your mom is wrong about the egg staying in your ovary and growing, that would be like an etopic pregnancy. Maybe she meant a cyst on your ovary.  Either way, go to the doctor.|`|NE96fU9vaa	if you have had sex, could be a tubal (etopic) pregnancy, which requires the emergency room, if not maybe cists, or, just crampy, you can go get checked if youre worried..
9d7fd1252c50a3dfd3eb49ccf2a18235aa	you're headaches could be caused by stress or tension.massaging your neck and your shoulders should help to loosen up your muscles to relieve tension.
wwRbkCMraa	Not necessarily, but you could make your own gainers... maybe something like this.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriecC0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6TQBhriec...</a><br>  <br>  Cheaper and taste 10 times better!
jH8d3I6daa	Yeah, it's just that you look taller when you lose wight, because there's more height than width. :) good luck|`|vhTXHv3Eaa	If you already had a growth spurt then I don't think you would get taller...but if you think you are still growing, then maybe. I doubt that being overweight has stunted your growth and that you will get taller. If your dad is taller than you, then maybe you will get as tall as him. You should look at the guys in your family, because you will probably be around their height.|`|hbUaDewPaa	sounds like you are too short for your weight.|`|FaVYRoXqaa	no...one has nothing to do with the other.  He's right though, you will look taller.|`|F8EnH6JQaa	NO, but losing weight will make you look taller
PA7LbQyRaa	Oh yes, I worked as a fisherman for a few years, and we would sometimes only get 2 hours of sleep in a night, and yes I would be sooo disoriented i thought i was dreaming some mornings when i had to wake up. Your body needs 8 hours of sleep to be fully rested, if your not getting that then you will definitly feel side effects. Remember you can die from lack of sleep and you need to rest your muscles so get to bed!|`|BE1ntMkwaa	I know when one of my friends had those symptoms that they went to the doctor and she found out she had mono. I'm not saying that this is what you have but i know i get dizzy when i get up really quick in the morning. Take it easy in the morning or go to bed early, that's what i do! Hope this helps!
4ZE8RG7Waa	yep down there and there is oral thrush no need for me to explain that!|`|mWBD1Mgyaa	Yes...it is a bacteria.|`|AA12358000	Flower,<br>  The brief answer is yes, but it requires quantifying. In rare cases, a yeast infection can be spread through vaginal or  cunnilingual intercourse among partners who have unprotected sex, but the risk is low. Like any other vaginal infection, they should be treated immediately, and if you are sexually active and your partner is having symptoms, he or she should also seek treatment. In any case, sex should only resume once symptoms disappear. Women commonly misdiagnose themselves with yeast infections when they need to be treated for other conditions. Recurring yeast infections can sometimes be a sign of an STI or some other condition that requires treatment, such as a bacterial infection. If you or your partner frequently experience some of the symptoms, it’s advisable to get tested to rule out STIs. Yeast is a FUNGUS and NOT a bacteria as the answer of Christie indicates. <br>  <br>  ALL ANSWERS SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY RESEARCHED, IN ANY FORUM AND ESPECIALLY IN THIS ONE. -  MANY ANSWERS ARE FLAWED.<br>  <br>  <br>  The information provided here should not be used during any medical emergency or for the diagnosis or treatment of any medical condition.

What has helped me is variety.  I don't have the tolerance to get on a machine like a hamster.  I did find a walking partner recently and we walk 5 miles a few times a week. In addition, I do find that some exercise dvd's are tolerable to me, but I have to vary those too. <br>  My friend likes to ride her bike for exercise.<br>  Simply realizing that I don't need to force myself to do something I hate has been a big help. I found ways to exercise that I enjoy and every person is different in their tastes.  Just give yourself permission to be exempt from doing the ones you hate and replace it with exercising that brings you some enjoyment.

2EqtniyQaa	Answers For You:<br>  <br>  1- Normal.  How much do you weigh?  If you're smaller, and have like no fat on you, then you might have difficulties having bigger boobs.  If you're bigger, then you'll fill out when your puberty goes on.  Just wait. <br>  2- They're growing right now.  My friend is 25, and her boobs were growing, but she said that they finally stopped.<br>  3-God...who knows?  It's all different for others.  I just buy like two or three bras for a size, because I never know like when I'll need to buy some more.  So keep your stock low...lol.  Like buy a push-up, a normal one, and maybe a water bra!

N28zLxtpaa	All women have a small amount of discharge.  Some more than others.  It is the body's way of cleaning itself.  Tell your friend to talk to her mom about it, and if she's concerned, she can go see the doctor to make sure it's just normal discharge and not something more serious.|`|JKM7CEpnaa	It's normal discharge.

When your fertile|`|EDXh0tk9aa	Show her this:<br>  <br>  Once a girl starts puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. This same discharge increases the closer a girl gets to ovulation and when she is sexually aroused. Trust me, she doesn't ever want it to go away. She will also have her own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to her than to others. <br>  <br>  She can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period. It will also continue after she gets her period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers her,<br>  .<br>  The normal white/clear discharge will dry yellow when exposed to air.  If it's coming out yellow, she could have a bacterial infection and would need to see a doctor.<br>  <br>  Different Types of Discharge:<br>  <br>  White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.<br>  <br>  Different types of infections:<br>  <br>  Signs of yeast infections:<br>  White, cottage cheese-like discharge <br>  Swelling and pain around the vulva <br>  Intense itching <br>  <br>  Signs of bacterial vaginosis:<br>  A white, gray or yellowish vaginal discharge <br>  A fishy odor that is strongest after sex or after washing with soap <br>  Itching or burning <br>  Slight redness and swelling of the vagina or vulva|`|JHQiIl34aa	Don't panic it's normal. im afraid being female is full of surprises and it doesn't change much with age.

Sorry hun it's part of growing up.|`|gIsMXFkGaa	she probably has a uti(urinary track infection), this happens with different underwear, tight jeans, or if she isnt washing her vagina properly. she should go to a doctor, they will give her pills that will get rid of it in a few days.|`|xnrGEJZQaa	oh thats just discharge its a regular thing to happen to a girl<br>  if she has not started her periods this is an indication that it will start ina year or so<br>  but if she has already started her periods then its still normal coz a girl gets discharge between her periods coz her vagina is cleaning itself<br>  so dont worry its completely normal and quite good for her vagina<br>  xoxox|`|fyP4GxlLaa	It's just discharge :) Nothing to worry about! It's normal. Girls who have their periods without discharge would be abnormal! So this is a sign of maturity.

py0DpCh4aa	EDIT::::: I suggest no more than 30 minutes of exercize a day while on the Special K diet.  <br>  <br>  <br>  (((hugs)))<br>  I was 230 when I began the special K diet.  I could only do it for 1 week but I'm down to 221!<br>  I did exercize while doing it.<br>  I am beginning again in earnst tomorrow!<br>  <br>  here's the plan in case you weren't aware of it: Some people tend to think it's only cereal BUT there can be a lot of variation with this diet.<br>  <br>  Breakfast: 1 special K red berries waffle w/ 2 teaspoons light syrup AND fruit<br>  OR<br>  1 serving size cereal (3/4C up to 1C depending on the type of cereal) with 1/2 C up to 2/3 C skim milk and fruit ((I often ate 2 bowls of cereal a day, with 1/2 C skim milk each time, this equals 1/2 gallon of milk in a week. you can buy a whole gallon of milk b/cause it's cheaper & freeze the other half if you won't use it in time, thaw out when you're ready to use it)<br>  <br>  Snack #1. (see below) <br>  <br>  Meal #2: 1 meal replacement bar with fruit<br>  OR <br>  1 serving size cereal with 1/2 C up to 2/3 C skim milk and fruit<br>  ~~Some progresso light soups are 120 Calories for the whole can (same amount of calories in 1 serving size of cereal) so sometimes I have progresso light soup with 1/2 C skim milk to drink for lunch instead, because it's the same caloric value. ~~~~ <br>  <br>  Snack #2. (see below) <br>  <br>  Meal #3 : I found the diet only worked if I ate ONE PLATE full of dinner food (or lunch or whichever meal I choose to eat), I had to limit myself or I would gorge myself, and not loose weight. (that gorging was my week #2 on the diet...)<br>  <br>  Snacks:<br>  1 special K snack twice a day (protein bar, cereal bar, protein water or snack crackers)<br>  Fat Free /NON fat yogurt also has the same caloric value as special K snacks so I often eat a yogurt for 1 of my snacks.<br>  Curves, and a few other snack bars hold the same caloric value as the special K snacks (90 calories) so they would work too, if you find them cheaper or taste better or want variety. <br>  <br>  You could probably even use any 100 calorie packs as well for 1 or 2 of the snacks & still successfully loose weight. <br>  <br>  DRINKS:  You are supposed to drink whatever you normally drink.  Personally I recommend some diet soda & water.  (If you're not careful you may drink too much of something like chocolate milk, or regular soda or coffee with regular milk & sugar, or hot chocolate, or milkshakes ETC and end up drinking all your calories & not losing....)<br>  <br>  <br>  EXTRA SNACKS: FRUIT and/or VEGETABLES<br>  <br>  The price of the food, is expensive.<br>  I found a lot of the cereal and bars 3/$5 because I hit a local ding & dent store (a thrift food store).  You can look for one in your area!<br>  Many of the products are past their 'best by' date, but it's very cheap to purchase here, and use your own judgement! <br>  <br>  You are allowed to eat your 1 regular meal a day for breakfast, lunch OR dinner, just replace the other 2 meals.<br>  <br>  GL|`|iABAZj2Haa	well im not sure if it works but what i have done is just eat less calories that my body naturally burns a day<br>  <br>  for example<br>  <br>  my body burns 2700 a day<br>  i eat 1200 ( which is the lowest you should go)<br>  and therefore i have a negative amount of 1500 calories left <br>  <br>  once you get to -3500 calories you loose a pound of fat<br>  i basically eat whatever as long as by the end of the day i dont go over 1200 calories<br>  <br>  if you want to know how many calories your body burns a day naturally then go here<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.physicsdiet.com/HowManyCaloriesDoesMyBodyBurn.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.physicsdiet.com/HowManyCalori...</a><br>  and just eat less than what your body b urns and you will lose weight easily!
VHDXQhY6aa	personally i think you're freaking out a bit on something that's not a huge deal, but a great fat blaster is to get on a treadmill and do sprints...sounds like you do the elliptical a lot, and doing one thing a lot gets your body accustomed to it so that it becomes more efficient and burns less calories.  i know you probably hate the treadmill and the bike, however, i suggest switching between the 3 regularly, and to do sprints on the treadmill, what i do is go 1 for 1, one minute sprinting and one minute jogging/walking if you need...so say you start at 4.5, you can then go up to say, 6 for a minute each.  if you need to jog/walk at first, i suggest about 3.5 and about 5.5, not to mention you can pick up a shape magazine or sometimes muscle and fitness and they give you great workouts that will burn more calories than you just ate.  so do some research and you can learn more effective ways to burn fat and you won't have to calorie count so hard that you're beating yourself up over panera...it's a win-win, i promise!|`|2yI17yqFaa	The most effective way to burn fat is to consume less and workout more often, the difficulties arise when we in reality try to put that into operation! There are lots of stumbling blocks in the big wide world don't you think?!

y8HyP1bzaa	Changing your underwear 4 or 5 times each day is a bit excessive.  Actually, it's very excessive.  If you notice yourself feeling wet, you might want to try using pantiliners.  That way whenever you feel wet, you can just change the pantiliner.  This will save you a lot of laundry, too!

EGjLViVbaa	You sound like an ideal slim weight.  I'm glad your mom won't let you buy diet foods.  Most 'diet foods' are marketed on the basis that they are low in fat and calories - and those who market them hope that most people don't know that that means they're usually full of sugars or hidden sugars instead.  Eating these products doesn't make you lose weight, and it certainly doesn't make you healthy.<br>  <br>  What you eat now looks deficient in protein.  You have to eat sufficient protein each day or your body will be forced to break down your lean muscle to get what it needs for everyday repair and renewal.  This can end up with you replacing muscle with fat, which is exactly what you don't want and will depress your metabolism, meaning you'll need a decreasing number of calories per day just to maintain never mind lose weight.  <br>  <br>  What would be best for your long-term health and long-term ability to keep slender would be to add more protein and lots of vegetables, drink water instead of sugary sodas and keep chocolates and that kind of thing to a once a week treat.|`|9xG5qZHxaa	Nothing!

22c62deec8de00bc570cec69eda38a6caa	There are so many things you can do at your house. It depends what level you are at. Nonetheless, sit-ups and push-ups will not be enough because your body will get used to them. For example, one day do abs, the other arms, etc. So you need to change it up. Use weights and do different types of workouts. For abs, do different exercises to target different areas. YouTube exercises. They are good for giving ideas, really.

You can try looking up your food on www.calorieking.com (its free).  Just search for whatever you ate and it'll give you the calorie count and the nutrition info, too.  That being said, if I had to make a wild guess, you've probably eaten about 350 calories (depending on how much butter you used).

In fact, I've heard it's one of the best body types for child birth ( not that you want a child at 13, but when your older you'll be thankful! :) ).<br>  <br>  Anyway, you're 13. You don't need to worry about it because..<br>  <br>  Flat chested: you have many, many years of boob growth left, so you don't need to worry about that yet!<br>  <br>  Curvy hips: lots of women would LOVE to have proper curves, it's your body developing so you can have babies. It's puberty and like I said, curves are good!<br>  <br>  Big tummy: Lots of teens get puppy fat and most of them lose it as they grow older. If it doesn't go away, exercise is always healthy :)<br>  <br>  You eat the same as your cousin: As long as you are eating healthily, there isn't a problem! She might just have a faster metabolism than you do. If you are eating junk food, then fruit and healthy food will help, if you are already eating healthily, YAY you! :D you don't need to worry.<br>  <br>  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is don't worry just yet. Give your body time, you're still growing so it needs a chance to even itself out! Be happy and confident, and if there is anything you think you COULD change that might be an effect, then go for it! As long as it's healthy then it can't do any harm!<br>  <br>  BE confident and good luck :D|`|rxScdXM4aa	eat healthier and sometimes this is apart of growing up. it is natural for you to be putting on weight and getting curvier. the other parts of your body will fall into place soon enough.|`|oT3d4Yu0aa	what does being flat chested have to do with your question?

I thought this was an important topic to share with you because the reality is that most people simply don't realize how dangerous their excess abdominal fat really is to their health.<br>  <br>  The Hidden Dangers of Your Excess Abdominal Fat - It's More Serious Than a Vanity Issue!<br>  <br>  by Mike Geary, Certified Nutrition Specialist, Certified Personal Trainer<br>  <br>  Did you know that the vast majority of people in this day and age have excess abdominal fat? The first thing that most people think of is that their extra abdominal fat is simply ugly, is covering up their abs from being visible, and makes them self conscious about showing off their body.<br>  <br>  However, what most people don't realize is that excess abdominal fat in particular, is not only ugly, but is also a dangerous risk factor to your health. Scientific research has clearly demonstrated that although it is unhealthy in general to have excess body fat throughout your body, it is also particularly dangerous to have excess abdominal fat.<br>  <br>  There are two types of fat that you have in your abdominal area. The first type that covers up your abs from being visible is called subcutaneous fat and lies directly beneath the skin and on top of the abdominal muscles.<br>  <br>  The second type of fat that you have in your abdominal area is called visceral fat, and that lies deeper in the abdomen beneath your muscle and surrounding your organs. Visceral fat also plays a role in giving certain men that "beer belly" appearance where their abdomen protrudes excessively but at the same time, also feels sort of hard if you push on it.<br>  <br>  Both subcutaneous fat and visceral fat in the abdominal area are serious health risk factors, but science has shown that having excessive visceral fat is even more dangerous than subcutaneous fat. Both of them greatly increase the risk your risk of developing heart disease, diabetes, high blood pressure, stroke, sleep apnea, various forms of cancer, and other degenerative diseases.<br>  <br>  Part of the reason visceral fat is particularly dangerous is that it apparently releases more inflammatory molecules into your body on a consistent basis.<br>  <br>  If you care about the quality of your life and your loved ones, reducing your abdominal fat should be one of your TOP priorities! There's just no way around it. Besides, a side-effect of finally getting rid of all of that excessive ugly abdominal fat is that your stomach will flatten out, and if you lose enough stomach fat, you will be able to visibly see those sexy six pack abs that everyone wants.<br>  <br>  So what gets rid of extra abdominal fat? Is there actually a REAL solution beyond all of the gimmicks and hype that you see in ads and on commercials for "miracle" fat loss products?<br>  <br>  The first thing you must understand is that there is absolutely NO quick fix solution. There are no pills or supplements of any sort that will help you lose your abdominal fat faster. Also, none of the gimmicky ab rockers, rollers, or ab belts will help get rid of abdominal fat either. You can't spot reduce your stomach fat by using any of these worthless contraptions. It simply doesn't work that way.<br>  <br>  The ONLY solution to consistently lose your abdominal fat and keep it off for good is to combine a sound nutritious diet full of unprocessed natural foods with a properly designed strategic exercise program that stimulates the necessary hormonal and metabolic response within your body. Both your food intake as well as your training program are important if you are to get this right.<br>  <br>  I've actually even seen a particular study that divided thousands of participants into a diet-only group and an exercise/diet group. While both groups in this study made good progress, the diet-only group lost significantly LESS abdominal fat than the diet & exercise combined group.<br>  <br>  Now the important thing to realize is that just any old exercise program will not necessarily do the trick. The majority of people that attempt getting into a good exercise routine are NOT working out effectively enough to really stimulate the loss of stubborn abdominal fat. I see this everyday at the gym.<br>  <br>  Most people will do your typical boring ineffective cardio routines, throw in a little outdated body-part style weight training, and pump away with some crunches and side bends, and think that they are doing something useful for reducing their abdominal fat. Then they become frustrated after weeks or months of no results and wonder where they went wrong.|`|6ISBTafTaa	Cocoa butter for the stretch marks.

You need to know your basic metabolic rate (BMR). Once you know your BMR then you can design a diet lower in calories than your BMR.<br>  <br>  But.... it is not always that simple. You could also have metabolic anomalies or even hormone irregularities that can make losing weight virtually impossible. <br>  <br>  Start with the simple stuff. Calculate your BMR right here <a href="http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calculator/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bmi-calculator.net/bmr-calcul...</a>  then alter your diet if necessary.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't see results after that you may look into the hormonal or metabolic areas.

How much weight do you want to lose?<br>  <br>  I lost over 3 stones by sticking to a healthy diet.<br>  <br>  I started off eating 1400 calories a day and then gradually went down to 1200 calories. Now I weigh 8 stones and 8lbs and I'm 5 ft 5. My BMI is 21 and I used to weigh 11 stones 11 lbs.<br>  <br>  Nowadays I can eat up to 1700 calories but bear in mind that I do not exercise at all. I have an office job and just about walk to the bus stop. I exercise sometimes but in the winter I can't be bothered even if i know its really good for me :)<br>  <br>  If I was as active as you I'd proabably be allowed to eat 2000 calories or even 2200 calories to maintain my weight. You can check your Basal Metabolic rate to see how many calories you need to eat to loose weight. Eating too little is not good either as your body goes into starvation mode and stores fat making you not lose weight or even worse put on weight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

35ca96dfe65df4ee3ff9a38263deb1b1aa	Light/scanty bleeding is when you only see some blood on the toilet paper when you wipe after going to the bathroom but there's not enough to get on your underwear or pad.  <br>  <br>  Spotting is when your getting a little blood in your underwear, but a panty liner is enough protection and you don't need an actual pad.<br>  <br>  Light Flow is when you only need a regular pad and don;t need to change it for 4 hours.<br>  <br>  You can guess the rest.<br>  <br>  Personally, I'm a tampon/panty liner girl.  So, I consider anything heavy enough to get on my underwear to be slender/light flow tampon days.  Then I move up to regular.  Then super.  Then super plus.<br>  <br>  Anyway, it's VERY normal to be spotty after coming off birth control of any kind.  ANY kind.  Even a non hormonal IUD.  Your flaw in thinking to take birth control pills to regulate your flow is that they only regulate your period when you are ON them.  After that, all  bets are off.  You're messing with your period too much, girl.  Doing that can make you crazy (meaning it will throw off your hormones).  <br>  <br>  Stop messing with the pills.  Start increasing your magnesium phosphate (found in dark green veggies or as a supplement in the vitamin store).  Eating a better diet can go a long way in helping things regulate themselves out AND increase your fertility.  Give it about six months before you start pestering your OBGYN.  Buy some home pregnancy kits and sit back and chill.  Stressing out isn't going to help a darn thing and it can even do a great deal of harm to your relationship.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|JHQiIl34aa	Take a pregnancy test

pjYQhPPBaa	You might have put on weight from gaining muscle from exercising so much.<br>  <br>  Word of advice, maybe it's your body telling you you shouldn't lose any weight. You're at a perfect weight for your height. Even if you were 5-10 pounds heavier than you are now, the fact that you exercise and you eat healthy (though I don't know how much of what exactly you eat), that's all that really matters. It's not always in the weight.<br>  <br>  People plateau for a reason, it's because their body freaks out from losing weight. Your body is freaked out from the yo-yo dieting you've been doing. Besides, some people just aren't meant to be a certain weight. Not saying you're fat or overweight by any means, but some people will lose weight to be at the proper weight for their age and height, but they'll look gaunt and unhealthy, simply because people carry weight in different ways.<br>  <br>  Please stop obsessing with your weight. I know it's easier said than done, but I struggle with the same thing as you every day, and every day I try to tell myself that even though I'm unhappy with the way I look at the weight I'm at, I'm still very much at a healthy weight (5'3'' 113-118 pounds)<br>  <br>  If this continues, you should go to therapy just a few times. Please don't become a statistic (a teen with an eating disorder)|`|kogsyGAPaa	You sound exactly like me. I went through this at about sophmore year and now I'm 18 and I've gained weight to about 132. I can't lose weight the "healthy way" It totally sucks! My story is exact!|`|Lnt4u4q6aa	132 and 5"4" is totally normal PLUS with the amount of exercise you do, most of it is probably muscle anyway.  Which is why  you arent losing weight.<br>  <br>  If i was you, I'd take a look in the mirror and learn to love myself the way i am.

Sounds like you're needing to add a little more to what you eat though. Try some portion of low fat cottage cheese with breakfast (great protein) and add a snack between breakfast and lunch and then one more snack after dinner. There are really great meal replacement bars you can pick up at a local grocery store or health food outlet. I would also add some protein to your lunch. Chicken breast, grilled ground turkey patty, there are plenty of low fat healthy things you can add to what you are already doing that would really help.|`|Ykzx3OVfaa	I think your diet sounds pretty good, actually. You're not eating a lot, but I think you're eating enough. The only thing I would recommend is eating some more veggies - green veggies. If you have a salad with balsamic dressing, you'll add no extra fat but you will add important nutrients.|`|VHmNfHa6aa	I think it is healthy. I didn't see any candy or soda in there....only healthy foods. Not sure how many calories you are consuming a day....just make sure it is around 1200 to lose weight the healthy weigh.

I know friends who haven't developed until going off to university or into their late 20's.  I've just learned to accept it.

vHxauOyeaa	it gives time for recooperation so you can work on it again in a day or two, but the set that you didn't work out on you can work in between thereby maximizing your results.|`|N9nJWYa5aa	It all depends on your goals.  If you are looking to gain muscle bulk as rapidly as possible then working on a specific set of different muscles will produce faster results in the early stages.  If bulk isn't your goal, but overall tone and fitness are, or in the later stages of muscle building your all over training is at least as effective.  Then again, if you read this area at times you'd thing there's no other type of fitness training other than free weights, treadmills, exercise bikes, ellipticals, and cross-trainers!|`|9faf164b8bfd02a8adbd83229d74816baa	Your muscles need rest.

This is Rediculously effective, and my muscles often grow so fast that I get stretch marks on the muscles.  Then I rest for a day, do cardio the next day, and lots of stretches, and then I rest another day, and do it again.  Works very well, but each person is unique, and does things their own way.|`|AA11988503	Most people don't do just one set a day, but split up each set of muscles into one of two groups and work those out every other day (usually split into upper and lower body). Giving muscles a day in between workouts helps them rest and get the nutrients they need to keep working. You should always stretch those muscles on the days you don't work them out though, because stretching helps them to maintain strength and flexibility.|`|mSQ194CMaa	your muscles need time recupearate to reach their full groth potential, thats why people generally divide their workouts (for bodybuilding anyway) into chest and triceps,the pushing muscles, back and biceps, the pulling muscles and shoulder and legs to complete the full body routine in a three day cycle.but everybody has their own way to train which they find best suits themelves and their goal,|`|sRIjVWCEaa	so you don't overstress each muscle<br>  <br>  if you do like 15min on the right side muscle and you lost count of the left side muscle and it's under or over 15min it can strain the right sided muscle

2U27BgmKaa	There's really no way that a body wrap can make you lose weight. However, what you can do is add a wrap to your monthly (or weekly) routine in order to get a bit of added help in that department. A wrap will help to keep your skin tight and make sure that the cells are at their tip top performance. Increasing blood circulation will help with cellulite and the heat will take out some of the toxins in your body if you sweat a bit. I would say that you need to work out five times a week. I usually do Dance Dance Revolution for 30 minutes as cardio and Wii Fit as strength training for 40 min to an hour. However if you are satisfied with your workout regime, then a body wrap will be a great way to pamper your self. Healthy skin will tighten and heal faster. Here's what you'll need for a home body wrap:<br>  1 cup bentonite or green clay<br>  1/4 cup sea salt<br>  2 tbsp. olive oil<br>  2 cups spring water<br>  Saran wrap<br>  Body Brush<br>  Soft paint brush (a 2 inch brush should do it)<br>  Gather your ingredients and take a long hot bath with a bit of oil mixed in the water. Dry off and dust over your skin with the body brush (you can find these at Bath and Body Works). Mix the ingredients together in a bowl and apply to the skin with the paint brush, then wrap your body with the Saran Wrap. Lay down and relax with some comforting music for 30 minutes, then rinse off in a warm shower. Right at the end of your shower, rinse off with cold water to close your pores. Dry and seal in moisture with lotion. Enjoy!|`|111c1567726b21cf846f2fc4c1754a98aa	I've read that those body wraps simply make you sweat which in turn rids you of body fluid.

6CU00J1Yaa	Don't drop the protein shakes, they are helping keep the fat off and the muscle on.<br>  <br>  Do light weights, high repetitions.

It is putting water in your muscles, taking away definition.|`|VHDXQhY6aa	you might try some of the "fat burner" pills.  it's a caffiene/carnitine mix designed to burn fat.|`|pMmOXlZ6aa	Dont cut down on the protein. But you might wanna get muscle milk LIGHT. Less fat. The only reasonable solution i see however, is to stop doing your muscle building routine and for the short period of time do more endurance routines(more sets and reps).

Depending on the weight of the objects you stole it may create back problems.  Try knocking out the old hag before you go for your run and then come back to the body to pick up your prize.

AA10958492	Pain in the flank area of your back would indicate a kidney infection. The flank area is about half to a bit lower than the center of you spine on both sides. You would feel a very dull, achy pain in your back. If you think you have this, I would suggest a trip to the ER. It is VERY common and an IV drip is used to flush out the infection. If you just have back pain, it could be a muscle strain. If that is the case, a Tylenol should do the trick.|`|268fbadb7ead2c9b7c16ca2a28b85c7baa	i think the liver is the one that does not hurt!<br>  but kidneys do!!<br>  take some pain killer and drink enough water and visit your doctor!!!

VPVg792eaa	normally you lose discharge before starting your period so you may be due to start them soon its not normally anything to worry about|`|EDXh0tk9aa	You are normal.<br>  <br>  Once you start puberty a white and/or clear discharge is normal. The vagina is self-cleaning. So basically, when you are cleaning you have discharge.  It can go away and come back.<br>  <br>  This same discharge increases the closer you get to ovulation and when you are sexually aroused. Trust me, you don't ever want it to go away. You will also have your own scent - musky - and it will smell stronger to you than to others. <br>  <br>  You can have this normal discharge for weeks, months or even years before getting your first period. It will also continue after you get your period. You can wear a pantyliner if it bothers you. <br>  <br>  Different Types of Discharge:<br>  <br>  White: Thick, white discharge is common at the beginning and end of your cycle. Normal white discharge is not accompanied by itching. If itching is present, thick white discharge can indicate a yeast infection.<br>  <br>  Clear and stretchy: This is "fertile" mucous and means you are ovulating.<br>  <br>  Clear and watery: This occurs at different times of your cycle and can be particularly heavy after exercising.<br>  <br>  Yellow or Green: May indicate an infection, especially if thick or clumpy like cottage cheese or has a foul odor.<br>  <br>  Spotting Blood/Brown Discharge: May happen right after periods, and is just "cleaning out" your vagina. Old blood looks brown. This may occur when you are ovulating/mid-cycle. Your first period can look like this also.|`|l7GjBVvhaa	It was clear and odorless and came between your scheduled periods then it was normal. It happens, it is your body's natural cleansing of the vagina. If it was yellow/brown in color with a foul smell I suggest you see a gyno. You may have an infection of some type. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Be seeing you...|`|VlAiW1WLaa	you're losing the lining of your uterus which is normal. your period is probably on the way. maybe you had a yeast infection even.|`|JHQiIl34aa	That's what happens before you start a period, so maybe they will start soon.|`|qwHAAvC6aa	i think its normal. if u havent had ur period then maybe its a sign that its coming soon. be prepared anyways!

There are no calories, and it's mostly made of water.

By doing this you can see a difference in your weight even if your eating pattern doesn't change.<br>  <br>  Making yourself sick is a bad option too because it can damage your esophagus and make your teeth look bad, so that's a no-go :P<br>  <br>  Try and eat only one serving per each type of food you are served. If your parents tell you that you have to eat more, tell them you are full and are going to be sick if you continue to eat.<br>  <br>  As for exercise, if you have steps inside or near your house you can walk up and down those continuously for a few minutes. You don't even have to do it until you lose your breath. Walking up steps actually works better because you are working your legs more. Hope I could help you out some :)|`|t8utvEZIaa	I dont understand, your weight is right for your height and if anything you are too skinny?<br>  <br>  if i were you, eat your meals, if you feel like you get too big a portions then you dont have to always finished everything on your plate. Maybe use smaller plates so there is less food?<br>  You could cut down on bad snacks, if you want to snack, snack on vegetables - maybe ask if you mum can start buying those pre-cut and ready to eat vegetables or fruits because it will be easier therefore more tempting to eat. I always find i feel better and fresher when i snack on fruits than chocolates, you will realise this and crave fruits more than junk food.<br>  Also do fun excercise like swimming, cycling, theyre excercises that you forget are even excercises because theyre so fun.<br>  best of luck, please please please dont try making yourself throw up again or any of those other dangerous methods, they are not healthy and will come back to haunt you later in life, x

Safely and healthy??? <br>  <br>  EXERCISE!!!! <br>  <br>  <br>  Run!!!|`|oubC3TCOaa	exercise your *** off.<br>  eat in tiny-bits.|`|a9BYPzKxaa	The fastest way to lose weight is to reduce your calorie intake and increase your calorie output by exercising daily.  Exercise 6 days a week for at least an hour everyday and cut your calories down to about 1000-1200.  That may sound a little low, but you're gonna have to if you want to lose weight fast.  And when you exercise, make sure you get your heart rate and keep it up in your fat burning zone.  Before you know it, you'll start seeing results.  And don't focus on the number you see on your scale, it can be deceiving and discouraging.  It's better to write your measurements down somewhere before you begin your weight loss plan and then check them every 2 weeks or month.  If you keep getting on the scale to see how much you've lost, and the number hasn't changed then you'll be very discouraged.  And with exercise, you will gain muscle which is why the scale may not even budge.  Good luck, take care.|`|d51dd7fd8f2fc17781c971e474fb25b5aa	Drink H20<br>  Exersize<br>  Eats Healthy<br>  Don't eat anything that starts with a C unless its in the produce isle.<br>  Eliminate stressors<br>  Eat smaller, healthier frequent meals<br>  Drink H20<br>  Drink H20<br>  And yeah... most important DRINK WATER<br>  Dont forget to exersize...|`|rvviZvOSaa	Fastest and healthiest?

7vKeZYcYaa	Jealousy's a ***** :) I have a large chest and I just laugh at those who are rude towards me or automatically peg me as a slut just because I have a larger chest. Women are just jealous but to be honest I would rather have a small chest! My boobs get in my way!! Haha<br>  <br>  By the way, CrashMonster, that kinda sounded rude and a little hostile. At least we fill our shirts out!|`|WyNOAZb9aa	It depends on if it is due to augmentation.  Women inherently know that someone who is disfiguring themselves to produce a false deception results in or causes a stereotype which is negative.  The hostility stems from the mentality that says "I am shallow and so superficial that I will get implants instead of being satisfied with myself" and indirectly is a slur to all women.  (That is the definition of stereotyping).  The conceptual association is: Fake Breasts ->  Female = deception, and since that is just not true, unmutilated women resent it because of that message.|`|P8MnLi9Saa	Because they are jealous!!!|`|hZYvd5jmaa	I have noticed it as well.My guess is some women wish they had bigger boobs or looked half as good as the women who are posting photos..and since they don't they are mad and show hate to the ones asking questions.|`|aD9ECQR9aa	I have no idea what you are talking about. I don't feel hostile If eel bad. because people with really big boobs get back problems and they can't wear cute shirts because they are falling out all over the place.|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	Because the media has convinced society as a whole that those with larger breasts are somehow "better," and superior and the constant blows to their self esteem (by it being implied that they are inferior) has caused some women to be jealous. And because they are jealous, they strike out at what they believe is the offending party (the woman with the larger than normal breasts).|`|IGu4bx51aa	I gave up trying to understand the female mind many years ago I'm sorry but that is the best I can do You women seem to be a law unto yourselves|`|PImvmP1paa	I think it's because some women are not happy with what they have and want more.

The doctor had told me to stop being active because myne was failry large for my age and that i should top being active in excersise sports or intercourse. You will notice that your period will be very irregular because of this cyst. The doctors have put me of 5 medications. Ocycodon,Tylanol 2, motrin 400 and 600, and some constipation pill because the oxycodone will constipate you. And you will want the cyst to rupture but do it on its own dont force it to come quicker than it should because when they rupture it kills im telling you. So just relax rest a lot and let your body make the desicions for you.

You can buy egg whites separately in the dairy at many stores.<br>  White meat fowl with out skin is a good protein.<br>  No fat milk is OK but not the best, despite the ads and it has tons of empty carbs.<br>  Yogurt or kefir drinks are better sources of protein because they are concentrated.

I am a vegetarian and dont eat meat so i needed to know a lot of the alternatives besides fish because that can get very boring after a while. be especially careful of peanut butter, use almond butter or just plain almons instead because they are much lower in saturated fats and have the same amt. of protein.

T7Xn2SQyaa	Maybe not a disorder so don't be so quick to act on it.  When I workout I only eat when I get hungry, which is the only time you should eat and not base it on a schedule, listen to your body.  This is what may be happening, your body doesn't like what you are putting in your body and perhaps you should change your diet to healthier one like organic.  The body knows whats healthy for it and might be rejecting the food that isn't healthy.  You changed your mind-patterns to being healthy and so your body is also adjusting to that mind-pattern.  I would check into that first before believing that you have an eating disorder.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Sounds like you need help, with an eating disorder. Speak with a nutritionist, someone who knows food, and they will tell you what you need to avoid in order to build some muscle in order to keep your metabolism in check.|`|bhyVC2mtaa	I know how you feel. I have anorexia (please, no rude judgements. this is a disease) and I have been down to 86 pounds on my darkest days of water fasting (not eating, just drinking water for 9 days was my streak). I'm 5'11, 13 and I know more about this than mostly anyone who doesn't have it. I weigh 100lb now. I'm in healthy recovery.<br>  <br>  My therapist told me that I shouldn't feel guilty, and its not my fault that I have to eat to survive. I had a life expectency of 3 months. I was fed through a tube and I had to get past my feelings of feeling discusting after eating to get out of that gross hospital. I plugged my nose and swallowed. My stomach rejected it without letting me have any say almost every time. I work out for 12 hours a week. I used to work out more than I could count the hours.. average day was about 3-4 hours.. gross.<br>  <br>  You have "disordered eating". This is the most deathly kind of eating disorder, because the docters over look it because you don't fit every symtom (maybe you restrict, eat less, count calories and work out exessfully, but not purge [throw up]). I had this at first. Get a friend or you mom or dad to take you to get help. This will save your life and you will thank yourself later on in life. Trust me.|`|b5f9eada2ae1ecabcb567944edea3c27aa	Sometimes that happens to me too.

6NA2MXNPaa	Doesn't sound like a UTI. What do you mean by "white patches"? Do you have sores on your vagina? Little ulcer type things? That would make sense if it's burning on the skin of your vagina when you pee. It's hard to be sure what you're talking about, but it does sound like an STD or a yeast infection. It sounds like BV again. You don't always have a discharge with BV. But you do get the burning and stinging upon urination. Check out the websites I'm attaching. You should go to your doctor. Good luck and take care of yourself!|`|LQvpt1CQaa	Sounds like a yeast infection. You can buy Monistat 7. Use as directed if the feeling is still there after 7 days go see your doctor.

a9BYPzKxaa	I'm about 50 lbs overweight right now as well.  In the past month or so I've been losing about 15 lbs a month, I was more than 50 lbs overweight.  Anyway, I've cut my calories way down and I workout everyday by doing interval training...jogging/speed walking.  I exercise about 1 hr a day, 5 days a week.  <br>  If you workout 1/2 an hr a day, that's great.  Also make sure you're eating healthy as well.  And make sure to drink 3-4 litres of water while you're on this exercise program.  When you are working out, even if it's for 30 mins just make sure you get the best out of that 30 mins...make sure your heart rate is accelerated enough to be in the fat burning zone for you.  If you're not even breaking a sweat, then you're not working hard enough.  They say, "no pain, no gain".  <br>  You'll start seeing results in about 2 weeks, and don't weight yourself cause the scale is so inaccurate, measure yourself instead.  Measure your inches and write them down somewhere and then after 1 month, see the difference.  Good luck to you, I know how hard it can be to get motivated.  But once you start seeing results, you'll be so happy to get up in the morning everyday to exercise.  I wish you all the best, take care.|`|jjHRaJ60aa	Are you eating correctly?

Regardless, your friend should see a doctor if anxiety attacks continue. Good luck.|`|3rJwDjbwaa	It's fine for a one-time thing. But if they are having anxiety attacks on a regular basis, he or she needs to see a psychiatrist and they may  be prescribed Xanax or something else in the same family like Klonopin or Ativan.|`|BHCeTbAWaa	No, cause xanax is sometimes prescribed to prevent anxiety attacks, not cause them. Was this doctor prescribed? Should never take anything unless a doctor gives it to you. No, it is not normal and xanax are additive, they need to see a doctor, doesn't have to be a shrink, any doctor can help them with this.

But it would be best to not have sex until after 3 weeks because the chemicals they out in you are very stong and have to stay in you  if you are having sex already you have just ruined your chances of aborting this baby possibley be cauuse it does take time for the babys systems to completely shut down and dissolve out on its own.|`|1NTjyGblaa	Most likely because you need time to heal. The process of abortion (cutterage) involves the abortionist scraping the womb clean of any remains aside from the fetus. This scraping could cause trauma to the walls. I am guessing that is why you cannot have sex until 3 weeks after, so there is lesser chances of infection.|`|6TK9iivGaa	Not so sure but thought it would be longer then that.|`|pRF5LLloaa	Because the damage they do "up there" needs to heal.
TQA4iLRbaa	everyone keeps saying your trying to gain fat?<br>  my guess is that you want to gain muscle correct?<br>  <br>  10-15 lbs by summer, would probbably only be possible through spawn. spawn is a supplement that boosts all your natural chemicals in your body that build muscle. go buy some spawn, nove-dex, and protein.<br>  <br>  first take the spawn and protein together then the week before your done with the spawn cycle, start taking the nove-dex. you'll put on about 12 pounds in a month or so. depending on how often and how intensly you lift.<br>  <br>  good luck man|`|FNdsPNrJaa	Try eggs, bananas, ice cream and lots of real dairy also Caltine bars and protein bars.

7tJNspGNaa	This is not something to panic about, and the people that have answered have no right to upset you further.<br>  <br>  A lot of men have bumps, and they're usually just sebaceous glands, which lubricate hair. Go ahead and google "sebaceous glands" and see if those are your little white bumps, if so you've got nothing to worry about!<br>  The skin on and around your penis is very thin, so the glands are more visible than elsewhere on your body. <br>  Most men notice these bumps appearing throughout their teenage years, and theres absolutely nothing wrong with them.<br>  <br>  IF these do not look like the bumps, than there is a chance that you have something else a doctor may need to look at.<br>  <br>  The most important question is - have you had any sexual contact with anyone? If the answer is yes, then yes, there is a chance you may have an STD.<br>  If the answer is no, then you should probably tell your mother - or maybe the school nurse if you're afraid of your mum's reaction. <br>  <br>  You cannot get an STD without sexual contact, so if this is the case, you probably shouldn't be worried.<br>  <br>  In any case, even if you have had sexual contact and are afraid to tell your mother, you must be treated. All STDs that go untreated can lead to serious complications, and much pain down the road. Make sure you get the care you need. <br>  <br>  If you are sexually active, make sure that you always use a condom, most importantly to protect yourself; especially important if you have an STD and insist on having sex.<br>  <br>  Always inform your partners, and make sure everyone's safety is always first.|`|cJPtKAU3aa	Go and tell your mother NOW!

1NTjyGblaa	I understand your situation! My ex was extremely well-endowed, and thinking I could "take anything" as long as it is sex I was up for a big surprise - it HURT LIKE HECK and at times I wouldn't orgasm because I'd dry up and even bleed a little. Lots of foreplay and lube did the trick. If he loves to lick, that would be great. He should lick you for like, 15-20 mins lol. You could also start with his penis slightly getting in and then out...then getting deeper... hmmm good luck and have fun.|`|z0B211f9aa	You have to really be in the moment and allow yourself to get lubricated and start slow.

So if you lose weight you still might not look like that person.  not to mention they have people looking out for their figures 24/7 pretty much, totally something that the normal person does not have.

How much weight do you want to lose?  What size do you want to be?  Go to the store an buy a pair of jeans or a dress in that size.  That way your goal is all about you and nothing but you.  You are doing this to better yourself, not look or be like someone else..i mean no matter how man leg lifts i do i am never going to have a j-lo butt.

grjDkG00aa	Just to confirm what you suspect, I think you have yeast infection as well. It is usually termed as vaginal candida or vulvovaginal candidiasis which you probably know by now and some patients are asymptomatic (without symptoms) and some are with florid, severe symptoms. Some may experience it sporadically or in some cases,recurrent-and it happens to 5% of healthy women.<br>  Wherever you are located now, it's probably best to go to a pharmacy and buy an over-the-counter yeast medication. It usually comes in suppository form or tablet form and it comes with the name of Canesten, to be used intra-vaginally for 3 nights at bedtime.<br>  If you cannot find the brand name at your location, it will help to look for the generic name which is Clotrimazole.<br>  Hope this helps :=)|`|68dae82437ede9e0c39dc1f85e7252a5aa	Oh, that is gross!  If it's clear and feels like a period you're probably ovulating.

Keep it up there for about an hour and do that 3 times a day. I know it sound weird but the reason you have a infection is because the good bacteria up there is low and you need to replenish it.

But the thing is it might affect your stomach if u get the munchies all the time and eat a lot and not burn some of the calories that you consume. because when you eat it usually takes 20 minutes for your brain to recognize that you are full and when you have the munchies you eat a lot and when you eat a lot you stomach can expand.also marijuana can affect you immune system sightly and I've noticed that it depends on what you smoke because some things give you a nasty stomach ache.|`|bjcjQ4zfaa	I remember I got that for like a month.<br>  <br>  I remember<br>  <br>  I attributed it to swallowing the smoke.

That is the calories needed to maintain your weight. Factor what you're eating and hopefully that will be the lower number. Subtract the two. Then, whatever amount gets you to a 7000 calorie deficit weekly. That is what you would need to burn. This may not always be consistent though. Water weight, higher carbs than usual, can factor in. That should give you an average of two pounds a week though.

He may forget, or not take you seriously - in turn, he may infect another woman, who could be more vulnerable and (depending on which strands you have) develop mere warts or cervical cancer. <br>  <br>  You should only disclose information with partners you intend to have sex with, and since this is a sensative issue, you should only have partners you really truely care about. <br>  <br>  When you're pregnant it may only have an effect on the baby during birth. During that time, the baby can be exposed to the warts; and develop them (usually in the back of the throat, which can lead to majour complications). If you let your doctors know beforehand, they'll take all the proper precautions to ensure the safety of your baby. In no way can this disease cause terminal illness or birth defects to your baby. <br>  <br>  You said you have "Moderate HPV". There are over a hundred strands of HPV, some cause warts, some cause cancer, and some don't do anything. Unless you develop warts, there isn't much to worry about.<br>  Inform your partners and your doctors, and be aware that you're now at a higher risk for VIN (Vaginal Intraepithelial Neoplasia ) or CIN (Cervical Intraepithelial Neoplasia )<br>  <br>  Best of luck, this disease changed my life, but as of now - I'm positive it was for the better =)|`|dQh1YzV0aa	well for the baby thing. to prevent it you can get a sea secion. my mom didnt with me and i got screwed. and for the sex thing just make sure you use a condom, only tell them if your going to be in a long term relationship|`|j240gfynaa	HEY, I HAVE HAD IT FOR A LITTLE OVER A YEAR(LOW HPV).

Although there is currently no way to test men for HPV. So the next girl that guys has sex with will contract HPV. I believe you should tell you partner that you have HPV, especially if our planning on having more that one sexual partner. And yes if you get pregnant the baby will have HPV. Its passes on, there isn't any medicine to help prevent the mom from transfering it to the unborn baby yet. And no if you get a boyfriend he won't leave you. I've been with my current boyfriend for 4 years and I had HPV before i met him. Just be honest.

Yaz is just one of many, many, many different birth control options out there.  It is not for everybody.  I think it's time to go back to your doctor, explain your feelings and switch to something else.  You need to give each method a fair shake, meaning you need to try each one for at least three months before you switch again.  <br>  <br>  I was fine on ortho tri cyclen from 15-17...  then I started getting a little nutty, so I switched.  Then switched again.  Over the next 8 years, I have tried EVERY form of birth control out there.  Pills, patches, rings, etc.  I finally had to give up and go off birth control completely...  but I don't want to get pregnant either, so I got the ParaGuard, a non hormonal IUD.  I don't recommend this unless it's a last resort.  The first three months were brutal.  Took me about six months to get back to normal.  Now I'm perfectly happy with it.  And it lasts for 10 years!|`|rGci1ehoaa	ive never been on YAZ however i was on depo for 3 years and just now decided to stop being on it because i was also no longer interested in sex...i was scheduled to get my 3 month shot jan1 and i havent noticed a change yet.. my best advice is to ask a doctor.

WKm2p9gvaa	I have done this diet off and on for years and think it's great. I totally disagree with the other person's answer about it causing heart attacks, that's just hogwash.<br>  <br>  If you have read the book then you understand the principle behind it, did you determine which body type you have? A, B, or C? It was while reading that section that I had my revelation about my health and finally an understanding of my eating, sleeping, and energy habits.<br>  <br>  One thing that I love about this diet is that while I am on it, I FEEL great. I wake up in the morning feeling rested and I have tons more energy all day long. I sleep better, and I find it easier to concentrate and focus on work etc.. I also don't have huge cravings for sweets or carbs, in fact I sometimes have to remind myself to eat because my appetite drops a lot.<br>  <br>  One thing I have found however, is that if you don't have a lot of weight to lose, say something like 20 pounds or more, it tends to not be as successful. I am not sure why, but the more overweight you are, the better you respond to this diet. If you are only trying to lose something like 10 pounds, I would skip it and go the standard exercise / eat healthy routine.<br>  <br>  Lastly, I found that the book reviews of the Atkins Diet book on Amazon.com to be enormously helpful when I was trying to decide whether or not to go on this diet. There are literally hundreds of reviews of people who have been on the diet and posted their experience. I recommend a few hours reading those reviews so you can get a broad spectrum of answers to better help you make a decision.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|8SRjELNBaa	I tried this when i was 17, it was good short term but i ended up putting the weight back on...

I found out that green tea actually has far less antioxidants than pomegranate, and about 1/10 the antioxidants as red currants. So, really on the scale it's not all that great. However, green tea also has caffeine in it which is a metabolism stimulator and also a slight laxative. Also recently I have been using green tea to curb cravings.

I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.  <br>  <br>  Nothing works,  besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.  <br>  <br>  First,  depending on how much weight you need to lose,  your diet is the first concern.  You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off,  even if you are exercising a lot.  Which brings us to the next thing.  Duh,  Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight.  Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising.  Do some cardio,  in the long run,  it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However,  I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off,  in my diet.  It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies.  I've found a great addition to help any one out,  it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol.  Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work.  That is true,  but not in this case.  This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch.  It's an appetite suppressant,  along with being a fat binder.  I saved money on the pills at theweightlossplace.com along with getting some good info.  It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar.  For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full.  Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said,  Dedicate.

SQv8DGb7aa	I am 19 and weigh 155 pounds.<br>  <br>  When I first bought Novedex XT I was sceptical about it. <br>  <br>  When I started using I took 4 every night. For the first few days I noticed nothing at all. When I hit the 4th or 5th day I started seeing some side effects.<br>  <br>  I seemed more tired, and started to get some minor acne.<br>  <br>   I worked out regularly and would do push ups, pull ups, sit ups, ect. everyday.<br>  <br>   I would also take 10 pills of nitric oxide a day which greatly helped by giving me more energy doing work outs.<br>  <br>   Also eating healthy, consuming alot of calories, and of course getting a good nights sleep.Its has been about 2 weeks of doing the same routine and I have gained 5 pounds. <br>  <br>  I am quite shocked about the gains I have seen and will continue to use this product. <br>  <br>  Great product though!
KolRRS6yaa	losing 15 pounds by May 21 is certainly achievable with a suitable Diet, exercise regime and a good lifestyle! You could probably do it in 8 weeks but considering you age I would give it the full 10 weeks...<br>  <br>  Okay, so if you want to lose some weight in in this space of time for your own personal reasons here are some steps I would take;<br>  <br>  Drink Water!: Drink 2-3 litres per day. This will help you to shed water weight that your body stores for vital bodily functions. As a result, you will see inches coming of your legs, hip, mid-riff etc. <br>  <br>  Eat protein: Protein such as chicken breasts, fish, eggs, meat etc. can increase the bodies thermic effect as your body works harder to digest these foods. Result increased fat loss.<br>  <br>  4-5 meals per day: This is better than 1-2 big meals as It increases the work your body has to do to digest the food. Result increased fat loss.<br>  <br>  Exercise 3-4 times per week: A light to moderate power walk for a half a hour consistently.<br>  <br>  DO NOT MISS MEALS!: This is SOO important as young peoples biggest misconception is that eatting less or nothing at all will help me lose weight. I won't go into detail but trust me stick to your 4-5 meals per day with protein with every meal.<br>  <br>  Fill out Body2Shape's Weight Loss Diet Menu and I will equip you with a Free & Personalized Diet so that you can lose weight effectively and most importantly SAFELY.|`|9J8EeZW6aa	no, thats not a ridiculous goal!<br>  you just need to strive for it.<br>  no weight loss will ever come unless you work for it.<br>  <br>  thanks for answwering my question:))<br>  <br>  <3 kenzie|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Read this excellent article by Bethany Roberts called Top Ten Tips for Weight Loss<br>  <a href="http://www.nhomag.com/00_v2_n1_4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.nhomag.com/00_v2_n1_4.asp</a>|`|bKNa7FbDaa	I think you should be able to reach that goal.<br>  It isnt hard.<br>  <br>  My tip would be exercie and eat low fat/carbs food....<br>  and drink plenty and planty of water.<br>  Exercise is the way to go! every bit helps.<br>  <br>  xx

They're fun, you should maybe talk to a fitness trainer first so they can tell you all you need to learn so you don't hurt yourself or anything.

249f16397397fc3179827521212ddbf7aa	1 Dietary control and exercise. It’s true what they say - all you need to do is watch what you eat, and expend more energy than you consume. It’s really that simple. You can quit reading this list now, you now know everything you need to know and didn’t need to fork over $500 for the privilege of me telling you the secret of losing weight. You don’t need to read a 4,000 page book, you don’t have to buy a tape series, you don’t need to stay up late at night to watch infomercials to understand this basic premise. It’s 100% true.<br>  <br>  2 Change your lifestyle. If you’re calling this a “diet,” then you’re going to gain all the weight back (and more) within a few months of losing it. Diets do not work. Diets are temporary. When you change your dietary lifestyle, however, you’re changing your habits - and you’re putting yourself on track for long-term / continued success and weight maintenance. Don’t ever tell anybody you’re on a diet - ever. I’m speaking from experience, here - a reformed low-carber. Worked out well for a while, but ultimately failed because my entire lifestyle didn’t change (permanently).<br>  <br>  3 Join an online support group. In my case, I created my own - FatBlasters. It’s essential that you not feel alone, and reaching out to friends (new or old) is typically a smart move. I just heard about PeetTrainer, but didn’t know about it when I began down the road to weight loss. You have to know that others are out there for moral support - they know things that you couldn’t possibly know, and they’ve probably been “in your shoes” at some point in the past (or present). Share stories, laughter, tears, successes, and failures - share them. There are thousands of communities out there, so keep looking until you find the one that fits you.<br>  <br>  4 Take before and after photos. I know it sucks to see yourself as a chunky monkey (sorry, that’s what I called myself - if only to get myself motivated to meet my weight loss goal). However, there’s no easier way to illustrate your progress. The “after” photos are far more fun to capture and share, admittedly. Find yourself on Flickr! It’s good to see yourself how others see you. Do you like how you look? In many ways, Flickr helped me lose weight.<br>  <br>  5 Hire a substitute teacher. Don’t reach for the brands you know and love immediately - or without thinking first. Eggs are “good” for you, but consider using egg substitutes instead (in fact, many restaurants will let you order lower calorie foods). There are countless “lower” alternatives for you to try. If something different doesn’t taste good, by all means - find a better substitute, or eat less of the original. In some cases, the substitute may be worse for you than the regular version of the product. The good news is, healthier choices are silently replacing their “normal” counterparts - and they taste just as nice.<br>  <br>  6 Start reading labels. I know it sucks, but you have to do it - and there’s no way to avoid this tip. If you don’t know what you’re putting in your mouth, you’re flying blind. Don’t assume, either - triple-check the ingredients list and serving sizes. You must rely on yourself for this; nobody else is going to be able to lose the weight or do the math for you. It’s not that complicated a task, but it will require effort. If nothing else, just pay attention to the calorie count.<br>  <br>  7 What’s so funny about bovines? If you like cheese, you must buy the Laughing Cow brand, and keep several of the suckers in stock at all times. The individually-wrapped wedges make for excellent snacks, and are wonderful when melted over just about anything edible. I’d be careful about straight-up American cheese, though - it’s oil, but not necessarily as good for you as (say) a slice of cheddar would be. I have yet to find something as calorie-light and filling as Laughing Cow (I don’t know how they do it).<br>  <br>  8 Tell your family. You’re not going to lose the weight alone, even if you ARE alone in losing the weight. If you’ve got a family at home, talk to them about it - initially, not incessantly. Let them know what you’re going to do, and that you want (and need) their support. If you don’t let them know, you’re running the risk of them inadvertently sabotaging your efforts. You want them to help you get to your goal(s). You want them to share in your happiness when you’ve made it past a certain mark. Who knows? Maybe some of your new habits will rub off on them and they’ll become healthier people, too?|`|2qj9wCR1aa	I think that excersize wise, running is your best bet.<br>  You don't need a gym to run, you can just run around in your area.  You can also do some situps which are good to get toned, but they don't burn fat so don't rely only on that.  I also suggest 2-3 cups of green tea a day.  It's very good in boosting your metabolism which causes you to loose weigh a lot quicker.  It's been proven with 4-5 cups of green tea a day, you can loose 80 calories JUST from the tea itself, imagine that put with excersize!  You'd be loosing weight so fast.  Make sure you are getting enough to eat also, otherwise your metabolism will slow.<br>  <br>  Good luck and I hope you stick with your goals!|`|js74CPyHaa	I would say running it helps me but start slow then gradually go faster. You don't haft to walk outside I sometimes walk inside on rainy days. I try not to eat anything fried or drink soda not that many sweets either. Hope this helps! Good luck!|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Here is where you can read a good article called "Top Ten Principles and Tips for Weight Loss"  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weightloss_tips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weig...</a><br>  They are good tips that work.

VB7RL0Jsaa	Hi! Well first of all not to lecture and blah blah blah but make sure it is a decision you are sure about because it is going to be something you remember forever and blah blah! lol<br>  <br>  Anyways, If you have never had sex most likely your vagina is VERY tight. Even if you use tampons/masturbate it really can't be stretched out enough to be loose unless you are having sex. So don't even worry about it. I'm sure you're tight enough.<br>  <br>  If you are still concerned, I'm not sure there really is anything to do to make it tighter besides doing kegals. Those are when you squeeze your vagina muscles together really tight and, hold for 10 seconds, and repeat. Never did it myself, but heard of it.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps and good luck!|`|cF236fvTaa	Work out your vagina muscles, if you can fit no more then 2 fingers in your vagina you are tight.

wzM5WB8Xaa	The best thing for you to do is to eat healthy and exercise. Make sure that you are getting at least 30 minutes of exercise 5 times a week, including cardio and strength training (the strength training will help tone your "trouble spots"...don't worry, it won't make you bulky). Also, make sure that you are getting enough fiber in your diet. If you eat smaller meals more often, your metabolism will go into high gear. This doesn't mean have a carrot for lunch. It means have some cereal for breakfast, yogurt for a mid morning snack, a sandwich for lunch, fruit as a mid afternoon snack, and a salad and chicken for dinner (or something similar to that). Believe me, I followed a diet and exercise routine similar to this for 3 months and lost almost 30lbs, and it was really easy to keep off.|`|NkOGRA7laa	Hi There -<br>  <br>  There is a community for teens on a healthy lifestyle and it has many helpful tools on there such as calorie counters, teen groups to join.

Make sure you fuel your body properly as you wont be able to excercise properly if your too tired.<br>  <br>  Try having your largest meal in the morning, something quite filling like porridge and a smaller meal for Lunch and dinner. Snack on carrots and celery as they have no calories and you will feel like you have eaten something. Soup (vegetable) is great for dinner as its quite filling. Don't eat after eight when you metabolism slows down. <br>  <br>  Probably not good for you, but diet coke really fills you up and has no calories, or just drink lots of water.<br>  <br>  Also, really try weight watchers food...you can get it at most supermarkets..Asda is really good. They are actually really nice and have little fat and calories. I think this is the best diet food as they do fill you up...avoid slimfast, you will not feel full at all.<br>  <br>  15lbs is possible but very dependant on your current weight and height. Have a look at the weight watchers website....loads of tips there.www.weightwatchers.co.uk<br>  <br>  Finally, stay positive, and don't panic if you do not see results straight away, if you stick with it, you will see the results.

rtiA0sC6aa	I'm not a professional or anything but I do know that you should not over train or train to little. If you really want results, you need a routine. work out different muscle groups on different days. You cannot just do biceps everyday and stuff like that. You won't let your muscles heal in time for the next workout. Protein is like a healer. Heals you faster so you can workout more.

He should be having about 2,000 or more calories a day depending on how active he is.<br>  <br>  Breakfast is okay but it is best if you put some whole grain in there. Try oatmeal instead of cereal and add 1-2 pieces of fruit along with it. Also, get some protein in there such as eggs, turkey slices, etc. <br>  <br>  Lunch is okay. If he is going to use sauce, make sure he checks the labels for the calories + fat. Also check the ingredients. A plain salad has a small amount of calories but with the sauce packed on it, it becomes a major no-no. You can add some carbs in it too. It keeps your energized. You still need the energy.<br>  <br>  The drinks are fine but make sure the apple juice is freshly made and is not artificial flavoured. Keep it to only a cup and drink water the rest of the day. Recommended amount of water is 8 cups daily.<br>  <br>  His dinner should really be the salad although you can eat two salads a day. During dinner, you should keep off the carbs now. Eat protein like fish and lean meat like turkey and chicken. Red meat should be eaten at a smaller rate, say 2 times a week. Vegetables are essential so grab a whole lot of them when grocery shopping.<br>  <br>  If he becomes hungry, which I would if I had to follow this diet, snack on fruits/veggies. Healthy nuts like unsalted almonds, peanuts, and walnuts are good. They contain HEALTHY fat for your body. <br>  <br>  His exercise isn't too much, but is fine if he is starting. Get him to try and increase as he goes along. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
m8GpkmVuaa	try eating less and more often it helps to trick yourself that your eating :)<br>  and only eat when your hungry and  stop eating once your hungers gone.|`|nv5Mewe3aa	Ok, well you are doing good, but you do need to just plan a little better.  The time when most people slip is when they get caught without food for the diet, and get hungry. Then they eat something like fast food or whatever is in the vending machine. Or in your case the pizza at the shop. You need to bring food with you when ever you are going to work, and any other time you might be away from home for a long period and might get hungry. Try keeping some fruit on hand. Bananas are great because they, unlike like oranges or apples, have less water content and will satisfy you for longer. Carrots are another good snack that have a high satiation effect. <br>  <br>  And lastly, if you want to trim up, the dinner is going to have to be part of the diet also. Most don't realize, but one bad meal a day can be too much even if the rest of the meals are controlled. You can't diet for 1/2 the day and expect results. Try going no fat, or VERY low fat for dinner for a while and you'll notice the difference.<br>  <br>  Remember, planning is crucial!|`|W3laEuTBaa	EXERCISE.|`|LexeS4Gzaa	Well I have see amazing results with a portion diet you just eat three meals and day maybe a snack too be you eat a normal serving size that way you can eat pizza too just the normal serving size
0ec82562a26aa12a1149c87e311c0d12aa	I work out both at night and during the day and I get great results.  I have worked out only at night in the past and gotten great results.  Results come more from your diet than from working out if you are talking about building muscle.  Eat... a lot, spread out throughout the day.  If you are talking about losing fat, eat less and healthier and do a lot of cardio.
6NZeItMAaa	No. A calorie is a unit of heat and energy, created by the body "burning up" the food we eat. This calorie or measurement of heat unit is the basis for determining what our weight should be and what our diet should be.<br>  <br>  In determining how many calories you actually need, scientists use the term "basal caloric requirements" to indicate how many calories you need just to stay alive, keep your heart going, and your temperature normal. We need approximately a calorie each minute, simply to keep living.<br>  <br>  Even while you are asleep you "burn up" an average of 500 calories. Most men and women need from 1000 to 1500 calories as their basal caloric requirement.<br>  <br>  However, when you work or think you burn up additional calories.<br>  <br>  How to determine the number of calories you need. I recommend for the average person the following simple "rule of thumb" method:<br>  <br>  For: MARKED OVERWEIGHTS<br>  A person markedly overweight is one who is 30 per cent or more above his normal weight. This means that if you weigh 180 lbs. but should, according to our table, weigh 135 lbs., then you are 45 lbs, overweight. In that case you should reduce your weight by using the 800 calorie diet menus.<br>  <br>  For: MODERATE OVERWEIGHTS <br>  If you are moderately overweight (i.e. 15-30 per cent; you are, say, 20 to 45 lbs. over and weigh from 155 to 180 lbs.) use the diet menus for the 1000 calorie daily food intake <br>  <br>  For: MILD OVERWEIGHTS<br>  If you are only mildly overweight (5 to 15 per cent above your normal weight; let us say you are 7 to 20 lbs. over.) then follow the 1200 calorie diet <br>  <br>  After you have lost an average of 2 lbs. each week and have achieved your normal weight, you should then follow the low-fat maintenance diets. These diets range from approximately 1500 calories to 2200 calories. They are recommended for the average individual who does light work with a moderate expenditure of calories in average daily activities. <br>  <br>  Maintaining your proper weight by a regular calorie count. However, since individuals vary so widely, it is impera?tive that you watch your weight carefully by your household scale. If you find that you are gaining a little or a moderate amount of poundage (say 1 or 2 lbs. each week) then you must subtract 200 to 500 calories from your daily menus. You can then reduce a pound a week and stay on this "maintenance" diet to keep your weight on an even level.|`|13d02ff43dc25d7183ebf769625c997aaa	A calorie is a measurement designed to assess how much energy is needed to break down the molecules of food into molecules that your body can use|`|P3Fot172aa	A calorie is an increment of energy.

KPcV3GNVaa	Hey! I got my tonsils removed when I was 6, and I remember it pretty well. I got to wear a short sleeved shirt that was mine, but I had to wear a gown over it and nurse pants. =\ I don't really remember the surgery, because they gave me that laughing gas and I was out and up before I knew it. I woke up and threw up, but that was the worst. I hear it gets worse as you get older though... my teacher got hers removed and she was out for a few days, but she's 27 so... yeah. it won't be too bad. I don't know about bleeding, I didn't bleed. BUT on the bright side I got to eat ice cream for a week! ANYWAY, overall it's not too bad. =] Good luck!

Or when there would be more than a few people around me in the same room. It was something that started when I was a teenager and that lasted over years and subsequently affected my career until not so long ago. <br>  <br>  At some point, I was prescribed medicine but I wanted to avoid that because of side effects. That's when I discovered a program that literally pulled me out of that "hole".

Indeed the non-diabetics glucose varies during the day between 70 and 140 mg/dL (3.9 and 7.8 mmol/L - the US is the only country that insists on using its own laboratory values).  Thus after eating glucose itself or carbohydrates (which are a heterogeneous group with a varied glycemic index) your glucose should not exceed 140 mg/dL or 7.8 mmol/L.

XwgoLxnhaa	I have been through it all and know what's it about. The main thing is to stick in there. You can't be an addict to food and never exercise if you want to live a healthy life and keep the weight off. I've worked out, done every diet, and all types of classes.<br>  <br>  Nothing works, besides dedication and intelligence towards the subject of losing weight.<br>  <br>  First, depending on how much weight you need to lose, your diet is the first concern. You can't eat 10,000 calories a day and expect the weight to come off, even if you are exercising a lot. Which brings us to the next thing. Duh, Exercising...<br>  <br>  This is a must especially if you need to a lot of weight. Get at least 30 mins of some good hardcore exercising. Do some cardio, in the long run, it's good for the heart.<br>  <br>  However, I find the most hardest part of losing weight/keeping it off, in my diet. It's so hard to keep your fingers out of the cookie jar or those chocolate goodies. I've found a great addition to help any one out, it's a natural weight loss supplement called Proactol. Now don't get all crazy on me and say diet pills don't work. That is true, but not in this case. This one isn't meant to burn pounds while you sit on the couch. It's an appetite suppressant, along with being a fat binder. I saved money on the pills at <a href="http://theweightlossplace.com" rel="nofollow">http://theweightlossplace.com</a> along with getting some good info. It basically makes those fingers not go towards the cookie jar. For me it's the best pill I've tried and I've tried cupboards full. Now this doesn't mean you have to follow my foot steps but I've successfully lost roughly 70 pounds and keeping it off til this day.<br>  <br>  Well good luck and remember what I said, Dedicate.|`|ykX5ApIZaa	you just eat smaller portions more often. like big snacks five times a day. it will increase you metabolism and burn calories for energy|`|YI9d2k6Iaa	Here is where you can read a good article called "Top Ten Principles and Tips for Weight Loss"  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weightloss_tips.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightlossfatloss.us/ten_weig...</a><br>  They are good tips that work.
1EsUa8HRaa	The active chemical in marijuana, THC, is very similar in shape to chemicals present in your brain called endocannabinoids. There are receptors for endocannabinoids all around your brain, including areas involved in conscious perception and mood. THC binds to such receptors and alters your brain activity.|`|RYf3sf6Daa	the THC|`|Hq7RvcDFaa	the thc in it|`|iMryjx0Yaa	Simple answer: THC (delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol)<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  <br>  Long Answer: Tetrahydrocannabinol is the main psychoactive substance found in the Cannabis plant. <br>  The pharmacological actions of THC result from its binding to the cannabinoid receptor CB1, located mainly in the central nervous system, and the CB2 receptor, mainly present in cells of the immune system. It acts as a partial agonist on both receptors, i.e., it activates them but not to its full extent. The psychoactive effects of THC are mediated by its activation of the CB1 receptor which is the most abundant G protein-coupled receptor in the brain. <br>  The presence of these specialized receptors in the brain implied to researchers that endogenous cannabinoids are manufactured by the body, so the search began for a substance normally manufactured in the brain that binds to these receptors, the so-called natural ligand or agonist, leading to the eventual discovery of anandamide, 2-arachidonyl glyceride (2-AG), and other related compounds known as endocannabinoids.<br>  In the cannabis plant THC occurs mainly as tetrahydrocannabinol carboxylic acid (THC-COOH). The enzymatic condensation of geranyl pyrophosphate and olivetolic acid gives cannabigerolic acid, which is cyclized by the enzyme THC acid synthase to give THC-COOH. Heating decarboxylates the acid to THC.<br>  THC is metabolized mainly to 11-OH-THC (11-hydroxy-THC) by the human body. This metabolite is still psychoactive and is further oxidized to 11-Nor-9-carboxy-THC (THC-COOH). In humans and animals, more than 100 metabolites could be identified, but 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH are the dominating metabolites. Metabolism occurs mainly in the liver by cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP3A4. More than 55% of THC is excreted in the feces and ~20% in the urine. The main metabolite in urine is the ester of glucuronic acid and THC-COOH and free THC-COOH. In the feces, mainly 11-OH-THC was detected.<br>  <br>  <br>  ----------I literally took tis right out of a research paper from freshman year haha.--------college that is|`|UYZ2oD3taa	The chemical THC interacting with your body it what produces the "high"

The major cause of bad breath is the tongue where bacteria grow and produce smells that are bad.  You can look for this bacteria on the top of your tongue.  It is generally white in color and coats the top of the tongue, especially the back of the tongue.  Now, to get rid of bad breath you must clean off the bacteria from the top of your tongue.  I use a tongue cleaner called OraBrush because it is a brush and a scraper.  It will prevent bad breath from coming back for up to 12 hours.  I really like it.

Remember to drink plenty of water and cut out the carbs and salt (sodium) in your foods.  You can have carbs for dinner, but NOT A LOT OF SALT.|`|EGFx6SGXaa	Everyone is like that. Just make sure what you reach for isn't junk. Or fill your schedule so you don't have a lot of time to spend walking around your kitchen looking for things to eat. All of the pills that say they block cravings don't really work so it's up to you.|`|MClFrDE1aa	Drink water and make a cup of chamomile tea. These will fill you up. Also, use balsamic dressing on your salads and vegetables. The balsamic cuts your cravings for sweets.|`|dgDW0Pt5aa	Your brain is addicted to food. Indulge in something else in your life... like videogames... that is what I do sometimes, other times I just overindulge in hanging out with friends and getting wasted.|`|RAxhHhU5aa	either drink water cuz it gives you something to do and it fills your stomach or go brush your teeth. maybe that's just me but I hate eating after I've brushed my teeth cuz it ruins the clean taste! haha
