u4liwDhAaa	I think you might get a better answer from a florist or a bakery (either stand alone or one attached to a grocery store).  I can't remember if you said you had a dress shop in your town but that would be another place I would check.  OK  This is totally random but you could ask your minister.    Let me know what you find out!  Good luck.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	Have you considered planning your wedding yourself?  We have been doing the planning ourselves and have quite enjoyed the experience...    I guess if you have the money to pay for a planner you could go that route.  Go to a bridal show in your area, they will have planners there with booths.|`|di6p10Ifaa	did you try typing in wedding planner and then your city and state on google? It could work. Sometimes if and when you choose a venue they can refer someone they work with alot.|`|ge3meKYEaa	I just bought a martha seward wedding planner book and did it myself- it's pretty simple.  Not like a planner gets the cater to lower their price.|`|SmWxP86yaa	Ask your sites if they can recommend anyone to you, also if you need help just ask here, there are lots of wonderful people on here that can help out.What advice do you need??
3pXHWC7Kaa	Yeah, try to get close to her.  She's probably smile at you a lot, and laugh at all of your jokes.  The scary movie might be a good idea, but you need to know if she does that to everybody or just you... maybe you could make up a little white lie and say that someone thought you guys were dating- see how she reacts to that.  Also, look into her eyes.  Really look into them.  You'll know then.|`|ryDqMraZaa	any sign that they whole personal space thing goes out the window. when girls like someone they want to be closer|`|YiA8Pe0Vaa	Touch is one of the best ways :)     I realised my current girlfriend definitely liked me when this size of hands came up in conversation, somebody commented I had big hands (I'm just generally big actually haha) and after I had compared hand sizes with half my friends in the carriage, the one girl who I fancied at the time struck me as being quite insistent despite my reluctance because I had already compared with 5 people! She also pressed her hand against mine, which nobody else had done and even though I'm not the quickest person to notice things like that even I realised!     Another good one is musical instruments - I've tried this because I play guitar, and coincidentally my current gf, who also does, tried the same while we talking about guitar hehe Just say something like, "I've been playing guitar for a while and i think my fretting fingers should be getting harder at the tips because I play so much, can you feel any difference between my other hand?" - That, if you can, is a great way to break the touch barrier while seeming topical hehehehe     Good luck! :)|`|L64QyBVeaa	flirt with her. don't expect her to jump on you during a scary movie...personally I like to be really discrete till I know the guys interested in me. so let her know you're interested first. then if she shows it back...tell her like...idk after the movie when you're leaving straight out "I've liked you for a really long time" and all you can do is wait and hope she doesn't rip you a new asshole.    love is all about taking that jump...and hoping the person will catch you. if not, get over it and move on. but if she does then rad.
8zfXJxxraa	He likes you.|`|Gu7D0qoIaa	no.<br>  maybe he just thinks you're weird|`|2YKUepLjaa	To be honest, you said that you've never even talked to him...<br>  the fact that he stares at you and added you as a hot friend on facebook means he thinks you're hot, not necessarily that he likes you.<br>  <br>  If he likes you without ever speaking a word to you then he likes you for the wrong reasons.|`|23d9099f0933327ba39ce022e12b6b9eaa	yes he likes you|`|3711d3mSaa	yup :) good luck
nGeYYZPraa	Generally I don't hug or kiss my male friends, though I know it's an everyday occurrence in certain parts of Europe, and my trailer park. Though more often than not, it's usually a handshake for me. Women friends I always hug if we haven't seen one another in awhile, and/or give a kiss on the cheek.|`|zuvpWX5aaa	Big Hug and maybe he will kiss your cheek. |`|2W9lxbSGaa	BIG bear hug. (;<br>  <br>  Kissing seems like an odd thing to do.|`|cmOZ9MM4aa	hug for a long hard time<br>  <br>  kisss would be awkward with a friend|`|2MVxXx1eaa	a very good hug|`|miqVrrOxaa	I'm not really the affectionate type but I will hug friends in certain situations eg. they're returning from vacation, I haven't seen them for a while, they are leaving, they are going through a tough time. I'm not really into kissing although a cheek kiss (for guys only) is the furthermost I would greet a friend. I don't like to be hugged much, myself though.
2W9lxbSGaa	Maybe he just misses hanging out with you and wants to reconnect with you again. Or maybe, he just might've liked you then and the feelings are coming back. I can't say which though, guys can be hard to read. <br>  <br>  Either way, he missed you. (:|`|2MVxXx1eaa	maybe but i cant be certain. guys are always so confusing. well if he was looking at you and answering questions he might have liked you or might have been questioning himself if he liked you or not. or just have been friendly by sitting in your group.  but it sounds like he liked you;|`|AA10690736	hmm.. i personally think no, cause if he did, then he would probably put more effort into interacting/ "communicating" ( that word makes me laugh) with you
2W9lxbSGaa	Sounds like an episode of Gossip Girl.<br>  <br>  She doesn't seem worth it. You're giving her all this attention and she doesn't appreciate it? Cussing you out in front of friends? Just tell her straight up that if she wants to be serious with you, to drop the act or just ask her whats really going in her head. Playing mind games does get to a person and you're at your breaking point. This girl herself is making your life chaotic when it really shouldn't. If she cusses you out again or wants to get together with you again, I'd say to act like the bigger person and give her a solid no.|`|XH2o1MM6aa	 .lt's over.Stop reading innuendo into everything she says and does.She wants your f'ship nothing more.
eHanA5F3aa	-Demosthenes|`|2W9lxbSGaa	I've never thrown up in my life, so shoot, I wouldn't know.<br>  <br>  But I'm guessing it shouldn't smell like the food since the enzymes in your stomach most likely have nasty *** smell to it.|`|VFYVgr5eaa	well i have never really smelled my throw up.<br>  thats kinda disturbing.|`|t3vGIjnkaa	A little bit, but a more distorted version. I try not to smell it though!
N84TSasaaa	i have i friend just like you who asked me basically that same question <br>  the reason was that the girls were jealous because she was hanging out with the cute and hot guys they liked and were mad because she was  in their territory and thought she had a crush on them <br>  answer just ignore it if your fine with just hanging with the guys <br>  but if you still want girl friends try to find some not so paranode  |`|eHanA5F3aa	-Demosthenes|`|2W9lxbSGaa	If you wanna play and hang out with the boys, then just do it. Yeah, I agree with you boys are so much to hang out with since they don't always bring the drama like girls do. You said that tomboys are looked down in your school - who cares? The boys won't care unless you're cool and fun to hang out with. And hang out more with better people to avoid being alienated or back stabbed by your girl friends.|`|7k0ahCiQaa	hey i'ma sophmore in high school i rather be with guys too and ehh its a bigger enviroment people dont really care, but in middle school yeah i know how it can be, well just be their aquaintence not so close just say hi have a mini convo then go with the guys:]|`|Siuf0Fwqaa	what is so wrong with tom-boys? i think they're awesome, plus you have first pickin' on the boyfriends. |`|zEk7zO1Uaa	Those are what are called Queen B's.  <br>  She's probably jealous that your with all the guys.<br>  So dont worry, its ok|`|jI5pfZ1Laa	Keep your real friends (guys)<br>  <br>  you arent weird for hanging out with boys..<br>  that doesnt make you a tomboy
ZEO7RhGzaa	EVERYONE gossips.  Even if people have tons of friends, their friends just know how to keep secrets better than others.<br>  <br>  I don't usually b*tch about people unless they get brought up by a different person, then I just say whatever I think hahaha.|`|2W9lxbSGaa	I never gossip. Sure, I spread rumors and tell my friends some drama that went down in school but I'd never bi-ch and back stab people behind their backs. It's just not cool.<br>  <br>  What I talk about with my friends is boys, school, common interests, television, family, etc... We would talk about people just like boys would too but not enough to be classified as being a bi-ch.<br>  <br>  Just mind your own business, we'd always say..|`|LpsnLhVSaa	teenage girls...tsk tsk tsk. JK but anyways some people are smart and nice and don't degrade others. I agree, we do "*****" about someone to some extent but damn high school girls are ridiculous.|`|DxbaEPbUaa	because they accept everyone unconditionally. |`|QmQ1licKaa	 If you can't say anything nice about anybody. Come sit by me. LOL|`|MyVtwtOnaa	Some people do it out of boredom.|`|UQlfW4sAaa	Mind your own business; cause if you mind your own business you won't be minding mine!!!
99vQPsp1aa	I am extremely random too so I really like it!! I think it is just hilarious and it really lightens a bad or tense situation. I am so random and I just blurt things out when the topic is completely different! Definitely a pro not a con!|`|2ea3b1109a1954597d6e6877c0d98075aa	Oooh I like randomness in a guy! Makes life more interesting :)|`|8VmahRqtaa	I think random people are funny, I love to hang to hangout with them.|`|uWdgRZfqaa	Well I'm sorta a random person myself... and so is my family... my brother went around town last night to see how many hobos he could get to wave at him... hes 10... but randomness is in my blood and personally I love it and anyone who is random. But not stupid random. That's just annoying.|`|n6TOtz7vaa	it depends. if ur in the middle of a convo already and you dont want to be interrupted then I'd be annoyed. but if not then no I think it's fine because it gives you stuff to talk about since it's been brought up|`|VoB5TSLiaa	that is fine, i think for that one u had lots of things in mind, being random is fine as sometimes i am like that too, hehe|`|FQFuQehQaa	love it. cos its so spontaneous u wont know what to expect. and u can never get bored of convo with random ppl!<br>  <br>  ur turn:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqaU5OXoaNSsK7n0HcQbXv3sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20081122143943AAOa2i9">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|JHRvsffJaa	umm..if its sometime randomly retarted then i think its kind of weird. but all girls are different. i dont really think you have anything to worry about.|`|QEux7dgbaa	i love random and fun guys and i mostly love romantic just like my bf :D |`|AAaqfEUNaa	I like it....keeps things interesting. :)|`|UFJlZl4maa	I love random guys!!

It show your humurous side and how free your mind is.|`|bv9cTR1Daa	i think thats cool.
Xw8fNsjWaa	So what if it is corny. It seems that he likes you and you like him. Probably the only people who think its corny are the people not Living your life. blowing a kiss is a charming and nonthreatening way of saying I like you. The world could use more kiss's whether they are blown or traded face to face.|`|Z0mChERwaa	Just smile and wink. It's coy and cute. Blowing kisses is a really awkward thing and no official reply is needed. Just don't flip out or over corn it up.|`|e44Ri0h8aa	A non corny way to not act awkward with him is to <br>  catch the kiss he blew to you and blow him one back then smile :)|`|yR0F6SGkaa	Catch the kiss and smack on your lips   :D    or cheeks|`|6JLe6x8Faa	Just blow him a kiss back. ^_^|`|iUE6K5HQaa	aaa my favorite is to pretend to be trying to catch it.  Grasp at the air a few times and then pretend to have finally got it.  Pull it down and put it in your pocket.  Pat your pocket and say "I'm savin' that one for later!"|`|wxkIHCbLaa	dont do any of that catching bullshit haha just smile sweetly and make eye contact
JeJPmsVAaa	if he changes his attitude after you guys officially get together, then he doesn't deserve ur love<br>  <br>  but, you should tell him how you feel, and find out for sure he feels the same way...<br>  <br>  i mean, if u guys go out then ud know u have atleast taken a try at this relationship, and if it doesnt work out in the end, then ud know and will find someone else... <br>  <br>  ><|`|SId47Vlyaa	Romantic ideas are nothing.<br>  <br>  Just smile & tell him you love him.<br>  <br>  If you're sure he feels the same, nothing can stop you from being together & not changing.  True love conquers all.|`|2YO0Yl75aa	Your relationship would change<br>  for the better or worse<br>  But if he dumps you/ you dump him <br>  it would be very awkward.|`|bWcJqSSbaa	**** him and he will be in space|`|jvKazMgwaa	Go watch movies at grandpa's place.|`|nRcSFAxlaa	stop using caps.|`|xd9fq0CKaa	i dont think he will change his attitude so dnt worry .. if he loves/likes you he'll want to stay with u. jus invite him somewhere where its jus him and you like the cinema or jus at your house watching a dvd then u can talk properly|`|X6hK915Naa	im gonna tell you this from a guy point of view...we dont give a **** about romantic and if he changes his atitude simply leave him derr

xq6dnRuhaa	Sometimes when you want something you have to be proactive and seek it yourself instead of sitting around and expecting it to come to you because it might not happen.<br>  <br>  I am going to give you some ideas on this:<br>  <br>  First when you are seeking someone who is "good", respectful, and not into you just because you are the "hot one" you have to look at their personality FIRST before anything else.<br>   It really isn't hard to realize if a guy has personality traits of a player. The guy probably is really cocky, has had lots of gfs already, and will be giving highly "suggestive" flirty comments without even knowing you (which means some disrespect towards you although you probably didn't see it like that). The "good guy" (no matter if he is confident or not) will not want to move TOO FAST, in terms of finally telling you he likes you and in fact he probably won't do it unless he KNOWS you like him too. That is why it might be easier for you to take the initiative to get to know a guy you might like who is also nice and not into "playing", than to expect that guy to come to you and ask you out (which is like saying I like you). <br>  <br>  Now, comes something more important than you think: clothes, attitude, and your/his friends. <br>  Clothes first. If you dress showing half your boobs, with tight clothes, and overall as sexy as possible, that will bring consequences. I know it is pretty and I know it is sexy and you might like it and that doesn't necessarily mean you are a ****. However, that is not the 1st thing others (and even me) will think. The guys might think she wants/likes the attention, or she is the "party-type", and other stuff.... to make it short, this style attracts the players. It doesn't mean that you have to wear your grandma's clothes, but seriously don't expect the guys to want to look at your personality first when you are dressing like that, and of course when that's what they care about there is no assurance of anything long-lasting or love.<br>  <br>  Second: attitude/personality. Your attitude says a lot A LOT about you and who you are. The guy's attitude can tell you a lot about him. On the other hand, if yours is not the attitude of a "good woman" but of the opposite, then don't expect to see "good men" coming to you.<br>  <br>  Last and the #1: FRIENDS. Your friends say a lot about you and the same goes for HIS friends. Want to know if he is a player?? There is a high chance that his friends are too. Of course this is not a rule of thumb, but usually if all the friends are crap you can bet on the fact that he is not much better.<br>  Same goes for you as well. If I see that your friends are a bunch of obnoxious bi***** and that you actually like these friends and are a little like them, I am not going to be with you, you can put a stamp on that.  <br>  <br>  And to close, let me tell you something about "good guys". They are not the players, but they, more than likely, are not the partiers either, nor the popular guys, or the hottest guys ever. <br>  If you want to be sure that the guy is in that group, there is a higher chance if he is one of the smart guys, by that I mean 'A' students of course. Of course there are exceptions, but usually the smart people tend to be good people, this is what self-experience tells me.<br>  Unfortunately, I believe there is a higher % of players that are hot than of nice guys and of smart guys who are hot, so that's another thing to realize. If you are looking for a guy that is hot AND cheater-proof now that might be hard to find. But a guy that is like that and average-looking, there are plenty of those, so seriously do not be too demanding on looks and look at personality first.<br>  <br>  There is a little bit of everything out there, so I guess the best advice is to not restrict yourself to the ones that go to you. How about you taking a shoot at one that might be the right one? And of course be aware of red flags and things I pointed out (his friends, # of ex-gfs, etc etc). And getting to know how that person is is key. Having some common sense is also key though, do you think someone who has a high chance of attracting women by the dozens (ok let's say the best dancer at the school) is more likely to not be loyal or long-term material than someone who attracts less women (well how about a guy who doesn't know how to dance so he barely parties)? hell yeah...... here is a good one: Do you think that Sawyer (from Lost) is less likely to cheat than Jack??? If you say yes you either haven't watched that show or need your common sense checked.<br>  <br>  So, yeah just be smart about these things and if the opportunity is given to you and you can meet the right guy, don't be afraid of taking the initiative.<br>  <br>  By the way this is advice from a "good guy" (as in not a player, not as in shy ok, I am not like that) so listen to it.|`|x1GlXJK8aa	play hard to get. or make yourself seem less attractive to those type of guys. most of all, just dont get yourself hurt/played when you dont deserve it|`|2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	become a lesbian. thats the only way you can get out of dating a player|`|1eCI5rc8aa	HAHA!! U girls are all alike..I bet u reject a lot of guys and most of them are nice ...but they are ugly...<br>  <br>  stop being shallow...|`|CB2ZzZxOaa	You're going out with the wrong guys, and that might be because the wrong guys are asking you. Unfortunately it is the jerks sometimes who are the most confident and who are the most likely to ask a girl out, and alot of the time it is the nice guy who is more shy and subtle about his feelings. When you meet a nice guy you like, don't be afraid to make the first move.|`|HbNBoOUUaa	well we can't do anything about it, its just the people who u meet everyday that will ask you out. Who knows what they like about you. Maybe its because your expressing yourself in ways that make it seem like you don't care about that kind of relationship? Or maybe when u say you don't wanna go out with those kinda guys, u should add why you dont want to go out them, that if thats the only reason to go out with you, then its never gonna work.|`|RG5elAZ4aa	(love ur name) i wouldnt look very attractive, as in not alot of make up, sweat shirt and jeans. try to look like you appeal to men like the average women. then chat with just, if they ask you out and your not ready say no. if they'd rather hang with you then the guys, good sign. if he wants to spend time with you and acts a little nervous around you also a good sign|`|AA10455214	don't go out with just any guy. When a gut approaches you remember that you must be friends before anything can happen next. No on can break up with you if you arent going out with them. Also dont let them control anything, such as conversations or the place you go because thats when they tend to get the upper hand and then make things tense are hard to deal with.|`|X9hiwvNzaa	Where are you meeting these guys?  Best place to meet guys that won't want you just for your body would be church.  Join one that has a "singles" group or club.  Go on trips with them or to restaurants and places, and the men you meet there will likely love and cherish you for "you" and not for your body.|`|w3r3ODonaa	Your probably dating guys on a whim and not giving yourself enough time to get to know them. Next time a guy approaches you take everything he says with a grain of salt. If he's persistent about being with you study his moves and makes sure he's genuine. Players are persistent but after a while they will move on to easier prey.|`|koHePHKdaa	Well unfortunately....alot of men are players and also alot of them stay that way all of their life and cheat on their wives as well. All that you can do is just dont give in......and make sure the guy sees you as a person and respects you....it may take a very long time to find a man who will treat you the right way....I am personally still waiting. Good luck and just know that you are no. 1...and you are worthy and deserve to be treated like a queen!  My advice would be to stay true to yourself and dont settle for being treated like crap just to be with someone.|`|HrPVv3eYaa	Ive been with a player and its no good. Dont give in, you need to stay strong and find a guy that treats you with respect.<br>  Get to know the guy before you get serious to know what kind of guy he is first, thats what I did. And now Im happily in a relashonship and its been 8 months.<br>  Good Luck and I hope I kinda helped =]]|`|Ykz2S1TAaa	ONLINE DATING lol my mom found someone great you will too!!  Ha Ha. Lol That is so funny trust me you will find someone nice eventually.|`|yP1H2LBKaa	Make yourself look ugly as hell.|`|QwNZsTaEaa	Easy.i have the same problem.in school or where ever you see these guys try to be around the shy quite,good guys and who knows what could happen.start a conversation with guys u know aren't like players.And maybe the "player" really isn't one,he probably just acts like that around his friends soo he doesn't feel like an outcast.So if you meet a guy who acts like a player but you can see more out of him.......go for it and if he makes one player like move be like "I gave you a chance because i thought u weren't like that" or something.And when it comes to guys lieing and being like "Score!".go speak your mind to them.Alot of guys thinks its cool when a girl isn't afraid to speak her mind.|`|EhDFNQ5iaa	Don't date guys that listen to Rap.

bdb1fbb0a6c3f2b002837336162fe1efaa	Eu descartaria a pssibilidade dessa pessoa ser uma garota (a n?o ser que você tenha alguma amiga ou prima muito brincalhona que esteja querendo tirar uma com a sua cara).<br>  <br>  Se você costuma pegar ?nibus, talvez esse cara te veja por lá, visto que ele disse que vocês só se veem no ponto.

RD359ikfaa	First make sure he likes you back.If he does then nothing should stop you both from being together.The tricky part is how to know if he likes you...talk to him about what he likes in girls and notice if he gets jelous wwhen you are with other guys.Also look for signs that he treats you differently.If he does then he definately likes you<br>  Best of luck|`|yR0F6SGkaa	I noticed that you used the word 'love' in the beginning. If that's the way you feel about him, nothing should hold you back. And your friend Hannah, talk to her about it, she's your best friend, she'll understand. You said Hannah 'likes' him and not 'love' in which you said earlier. Wait until he's single, give him sometime and talk to him about it. While your talking about it, remind him that staying friends is just fine and that you guys could pretend that conversation never happened.|`|B97UyW0Faa	ignore it and pretend it will go away, it won't, but you can pretend it will, <br>  <br>  after all, the chance that something won't work is always a good reason to never try anything<br>  <br>  5 years from now it might have fallen apart, but the sting and kicking your self for not gambling the friendship for the chance at love will burn far worse then the love or even friendship lost|`|hNhq4k31aa	I once started to date a girl I had been friends with for 7 years.  We only dated a few months and I lost a really good friendship out of it.  You shouldn't risk all the friendships that could be damaged unless you think its worth the risk.|`|BSz3GoCcaa	If he puts u after his girlfriends forget him.

Your friendship is more important in this situation, so if Hannah is more important than this guy, don't do it.|`|KMsTtGBMaa	You should tell him. Kiss him, and do the naughty with him. He will defiantly ditch his girlfriend and go with you.
IPS3hWweaa	It happens to any woman with boobs regardless of age. The cold does it, becoming aroused does it, and rubbing on your shirt could also do it.|`|9dNEw7etaa	Yes. Every 16 year old girl that is dumb enough not to wear a bra has that problem.|`|0t1QOKGVaa	Yes, and at 16 you should always be wearing a bra in public, even if it is a sports bra, or a tank top with built-in shelf bra.|`|k2BduC8Qaa	The air flow reaches them quickly, creating a "n1p-on". You're 16, you should be wearing a bra in public.|`|a1343f058c3dec40fe918611b8bc0ceaaa	yea used to get that problem as well when they get cold they errect. wear a bra if you dont like it|`|0ulKsvXlaa	I hope so<br>  It looks so cute
X5W3leICaa	Just tell them you wanted to see how she was doing because she was sick. You were being a nice, caring boyfriend, nothing wrong with that, even in a "closed society." You guys didn't have sex or anything of that nature, so you sould tell them instead of them hearing it from their neighbor.|`|ts0ovlOOaa	relax you do need to be more sneaky.|`|m3UGI2BCaa	Well you say it is not forbidden to visit her, just forbidden to visit her when she is alone. that makes sense. So how is her neighbor to know if she is alone, or if htere are other people in the house. He saw you on the roof but for all he knows there were people in the house. Right or wrong? <br>  <br>  You know sometimes when you fall in a pit you can't dig your way out, and the worst thing to do is start digging.  Lay low and say nothing. If the neighbor says something to her parents, then tell the truth. But don't say anything yet.<br>  <br>  Where do you live? I know in some places in the world, this can be very serious.<br>  <br>  I hope you kids are ok.|`|zoUECM0vaa	stop stressing out! your stressing me out aswell neways if the parent does find out even though i know they wont just say you come to visit them and they wasnt in or just tell the truth, i mean they need to knw your together.<br>   i feel so sorry for you :( hope ive helped <br>  <br>  you two sound so sweet together :)|`|C4EoYOPqaa	I just say tell her parents the truth. It won't do you any good if you lie because then they'll think their neighbor is a liar and if they find out your lying. you are not trustworthy.   Tell them that you apologize for sneaking into your girlfriends house when they weren't there.|`|X9hiwvNzaa	If your parents know that you guys are close friends, there shouldn't be a problem.  Just tell them that if you were going to do anything "Bad", you wouldn't have been on the roof where a neighbor could clearly see what you were doing.  You were just sitting and talking.  They can take her to a doctor to confirm she hasn't had intercourse if that is their concern.|`|W7uP1ty4aa	Dude, I'd go straight to your girl's dad and tell him the truth. He'll respect you for "manning up". He may, if you're one lucky SOB, appreciate you checking up on how she felt in her parent's absence. Seriously, tell her dad or he'll see to it the door will get shut permanently.|`|a50IPPfSaa	pray hard
mE0N72spaa	Woaah you're right, this is totally out of order. She needs to realise how much this is upsetting you - she was a teenager once, she must be able to relate on some level. ask her (calmly.. make sure you stay calm) what the reasons for it are. Tell her loads and loads of kids have been out with loads of boyfriends, and this is your first ever experience (even if its not.. a white lie won't hurt) it's one of those conversations that you're going to have to have a looong talk about, because there is something she is hiding. Try negotiating - ask her to let you see the boy for three hours on a saturday or something, be in at exactly the time she wants you to. Or let her meet the boy maybe - if she realises he's a good boy, she might feel more at ease... unless he's the thuggish sort then i wouldn't recommend that lol . <br>  <br>  If she still refuses to let you, just go out with him anyway - it's not fair to restrict you from having fun at this age (: just don't tell her if she's really really strict.<br>  <br>  Good luck lovely :) <br>  xxxx|`|WWNWtzvDaa	you will be a mother one day and you will be telling your daughter the same thing as she is telling you ...be good for your mother and show her respect after all she cooks , cleans and makes sure your safe and i bet you want for nothing =).... i know 14 is a nightmare age and mams can be embarrassing but you only have one mother and she is the only person in this world that will be there to pick up the pieces when you BFs break your heart ...|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	murder her|`|VZPtCkweaa	woah! that is definatly not fair! (i'm 14 and in 8th grade too)<br>  <br>  i would say, don't tell your mom things like that again. <br>  <br>  calmly talk to your mom about this (don't tell her about your bff with a bf.) and ask her WHY she won't let you have a bf.|`|whtWq2keaa	See, this is why you dont share your personal life with your family. Just say your going somewhere with friends. If she asks to see your friends, how about you go somewhere near the place and meet your friends there. And then later, have ur friends leave you and be with the guy.|`|0WfsZ7lCaa	do wat most kids do...they b bf and gf n-e ways<br>  <br>  and thats harsh wat ur mom did. ask her why and tell her ur responsible enough 2 handle it..and ur only 13-14 so the only thing u will get up 2 is kissin...leave that out tho just tell her u guys r just like*special friends* who talk a little more than other friends and hug and hold hands. thats it|`|xreWOKBYaa	Let me tell you, a mother like that will act like that until she dies (even after you turn 18!)<br>  <br>  But no, she is not trying to ruin your life, quit being a drama queen. She doesnt want you to go to the dance because 14 is too young to date, i agree. She doesn't want (even a tiny possibility) of a pregnant daughter.<br>  <br>  You can't change her mind, she is one of those mothers you will constantly have to deal with!|`|1r9gmgzMaa	tell her that you grown up now and you would like to have a boyfriend. You should talk to her about these things and the things you want to be in the future. little bit little she will understand. <br>  <br>  text him privately on your phone you can not ruin that chance you know guys they might really get upset and never ask you back again. and tell him the situation.|`|yAZq4SLaaa	she is the boss till you turn 18. However...try to talk to her, explain how you feel and ASK her if there is any particular reason she has denied you dating privileges. If she still says no, you have to accept her decision and tell the guy. Good luck.|`|GiHOnv54aa	Whoah, that is kinda harsh. Maybe go with friends and have him with you so your mum thinks it's just a group friend outing. Then spend more time with him and see if you two can go together somewhere. Be careful though, and try not to get caught<br>  Good Luck<br>  X|`|205ce36b2214521105667ecdc666b6c5aa	you really need to tell her to let you live your own life|`|bzjk7jRsaa	i feel sorry for you. your mom is probably just sad that you're growing up so fast.|`|27a6064141149e4c067b229800e7b9ffaa	Prove that you're mature. Reason with her. If you strop about it not being fair then you'll prove her right. Try to understand where she's coming from - she wants to protect you from the big bad wolves. However birds that can't stretch their wings won't ever learn to fly on their own.|`|769673b54b5f0954c7e21c7fe2878c65aa	well ask her why you cant date, and if shes worried let her know there will be tons of people at the dance and lots of teachers and parents there watching too. just say your going with your friends next time and meet the boy there, only answer her questions without going into lots of detail. thats what i do, i just say im going to the movie with my friends, sometimes she asks but if im really just going alone with my bf i just say me and ___, and maybe some other people, hey shes not gonna know who really was planning on going or not and if no one else really does go.|`|AA10904025	Right now Helicopter Mom is worried about you getting distracted from your goals. I personally think that if you're up front and honest with her about your feelings you should be able to talk to her about this. But before you do keep in mind the following: 1. She does not want nor care to hear about what your friends get to do. She's not their mother. 2. She is trying to look at the big picture, and you should too. 3. She might not be comfortable with you going out with someone she doesn't know or is worried that you're hiding things from her. Don't. Be up front about the boy, the plans, the objections, everything. Lying to her gives her a basis to which to refer her mistrust. 4. She is your mother. She reserves the right to be a pain in the butt at all times. Even if this is the case, you need to reserve the right to act as an maturely as you want to be treated. Read: If she tells you no, pouting is the wrong thing to do. Throwing a fit is the wrong thing to do. Keep in mind that Rome wasn't built in a day and neither is trust. You two need to both work on trusting each other and respecting each other's  decisions.|`|X9hiwvNzaa	Wow, that really stinks.  I could see setting some rules like a curfew on what time you should be home and whether you could go on 'car dates' or something....fearing he'd put the moves on you if you were alone in his car.  But to forbid it?  Do you have a Dad in your life?  Can you sit and talk with him? Maybe he can talk to your Mom for you.|`|C9Ohlbp9aa	Just be straight with her, ask her why and for a good reason other than "Because I said so." <br>  If she has a good reason, then listen to her, she's your mother.<br>  But if it is some BS reason, do what you want mannn.|`|zo1TJj1kaa	urgh God I have one of those. There's nothing worse than an overprotective mother.<br>  <br>  Ok, here's what I'd do:<br>  1. prove to her that you're not a little kid anymore and that you can take on the responsibilty of being in a relationship with a guy.<br>  2. she probably thinks you'll turn into one of those girls who go around sleeping with guys - you've gotta persuade her that you're not. wear a purity ring to prove it.<br>  3. try and make her see that if she keeps hiding you from the real world, then how are you going to cope when you're an adult?<br>  4. make her see that if she doesnt let you do anything, you are most likely to go and do things behind her back, and tell her that you dont want to go behind her back.<br>  <br>  good luck x<br>  please answer mine, its kinda similar to yours because its about an overprotective mother <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Asst6JoF4dq.tXVI9Llcj8vsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215124522AAcI2f7">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  thanks! hope i helped :)

AxaBvOvJaa	I'm exactly the same way. Maybe being around too many people makes you feel uncomfortable?|`|PF8zDzoWaa	maybe because your afraid that people around you might think your a freak. stp being shy and quiet, be you. and who cares about what other people think. start socializing w/ people in class and they will see who the real you is and will become friends. and maybe your just not afraid to be yourself around your friends, and think its weird when you do so at school.|`|pbPe614Raa	its just a habit,you get it probably from being tired so if you go on the bus and don't socialize like im guessing you do,then you have no motivation the rest of the day to try,the key for you is if you have friends on your bus get chatty with them and then you will be pumped for the rest of the day.|`|hvJ3rQfFaa	It all depends on your level of comfort. You are more outgoing and excited when you are with your buddies or with people who you really know...I am the same way in school I am extremely quiet and shy but when I am with my friends u could hear me blocks away haha....<br>  <br>  People think I am this quiet shy girl, which I am kind of considering that I am an introvert but little do they know.....|`|mYAbq6fnaa	i am the exact same way! i think that its just because your probably more comfortable in your surroundings and the people your with outside of school. at school, your with some people you dont know and some who your not really friends with, so you cant be yourself with them. its way easier to be yourself with people that your comfortable with. dont sweat it. :)|`|nYEkkNn2aa	it's because your comfortable with the people your with when it's just people your close with like your friends. i'm like that too|`|WyjRm10jaa	I think you concentrate more on your study..<br>  i also think you are 1 of the smartest kids in class..<br>  when you are off school..<br>  you feel brain free..<br>  it is normal behavior for smart kids..|`|pWz8d8MBaa	ur in a shell right now,, u care to much about what people will think of you that dont really know who  you are, the way to solve it is just to talk to people liek there ur good friend and forget that u dont know them as well,, and its probably not that big of a deal lots of people are shy  just try to overcome the reaon of why your acting shy.|`|vUoEgKxpaa	thats how i was in school too. <br>  i think your just not comfortable in large crouds where the people are way to quick to judge if you do something out of the norm.  , well thats how i look at it for myself now.|`|Qi72Npkkaa	i think it is because ur not as urself at school. ur probably to busy wondering what ppl r going to think of u. i dunno i am similar. it just the way some ppl r i guess. and dont worry it's not a bad thing :)|`|cvVMJQRZaa	Its because you don't want everyone in school to think you are weird so you hold off being yourself while at school and after school just snap and do what you wanted to do all day, and that's to BE YOURSELF.|`|B2bDFFolaa	Well only you could know the real answer... but possibly because you are more comfortable with your surroundings outside of school and it is an overall different setting.|`|e6Kyqb22aa	I don't really know but try to be more outgoing AT school|`|RYf3sf6Daa	thats how i am too|`|bq3AotVNaa	Its just because you are afraid that other people will judge you and stuff like that. It could be that you are scared of getting in trouble with the principle or the teachers, or that kids will make fun of you because you dont know a lot of them. So just live life how you must. Only be as outgoing as you see fit.|`|7vm3iBsQaa	OMG I AM THE SAME EXACT WAY!!! It is weird... I think it is just your personality, just like you wanna be good in school and maybe not as many friends are in your classes. It is pretty much just life. life can be strange sometimes... Like everyone who doesn't really know me thinks I am like very quiet and not sociable, but once they get to know me better they say i am a totally different person. This will probably change in the future... but there really is no reason why you are like that.|`|DVwSammQaa	Good question. I'm like that too. At school I'm quiet and shy, and then with my family and friends I am loud and I'm myself. I'm trying to be just as loud at school, but that's been getting me into trouble...|`|HNAVlwV7aa	I'm like that too. I guess it's the inner self telling you that there's a time and place for everything.|`|sGvOvksvaa	I am the excact same way!! i just think that i have to get to know someone really well before i can be really outgoing with them.|`|abbeQNPwaa	I have that same problem. Talk to a counselor. Try to boost your confidence.|`|SPnIxDviaa	I'm exactly like that too.<br>  Maybe you just don't feel comfortable with some of the kids in your classes?|`|MvzrzDSNaa	i am the same way... dunno why lol|`|SoSy4SwXaa	cuz u were born that way. <br>  lol
6e94a8d388077af25d435e64c41928cfaa	Not a big deal, the bigger problem is after you deliver you can't have sex for upwards of 6 weeks and typically after that women are drained and lose interest in sex, so your man will go from 5-6 times a week to nothing and that will be the hard part for him to overcome.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	You shouldn't feel guilty. He actually probably wouldn't mind the reason why you guys had sex. As long as he "knows" you enjoy his sex, whether you are in the mood for it or not, then you have done your job right. Us guys get an ego trip from knowing we are good in bed.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	Stop worrying about it. You have other things to concern yourself with now.  Nothing will induce labor.  The baby will come when it is ready.|`|AA12095067	Oh please, just get over it! You had consenting sex with your own husband - there isn't a moral system in the world that would condemn you.|`|mCM363I9aa	do you really have to let him know? Let him think otherwise, it will not hurt anyone.|`|AA11895524	Thats crazy!!!|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	honey we dont all do the right thing at the right time, cut yourself alittle slack.|`|0LHRBaRSaa	Honestly, if you just tell him about it you should feel better. I'm sure the only thing he will be upset about is that you really weren't in the mood. It will be alright.|`|E1vyiNYKaa	men do it all the time and when i was ready for the baby to come out i had sex with him to you are not the first and not the last get over it|`|HaGbQQNaaa	Girl please get over it. Have a happy life. 5-6 times a week..hell one of the days had to be for something else. Don't beat yourself over the head for it.|`|xZYWOZMEaa	don't worry about it... it's not like you cheated, hes still your husband. If you still feel guilty then tell him, just say earlier when we had sex, i wanted to induce labor so i thought sex would help. I doubt he will get mad. If so then i'm sure he will get over it, just make sure he knows that you love having sex with him that you just werent in the mood at the moment. I'm sure he'll understand and wont get mad. Don't worry :)|`|AYfJWQuTaa	Give yourself a break, you husband wanted you, so you were there for him!  first babies can sometimes be 2 weeks late, not really late, it's the timing & they will arrive when they are ready!|`|hs793CCxaa	Do him a favor - keep it to yourself.|`|AA11538662	Oh my, do NOT feel embarrassed or guilty, he's your hubby and you can have sex with him without having to harbor guilt or embarrassment. I bet if you showed him this that he would tell you the same thing as I am telling you.<br>  <br>  Mary in Camden, MI|`|y21VcTjDaa	I have to admit that's one of the craziest things I have ever heard...not the part about having sex to induce labour, the bit about feeling guilty about it....that's insane.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	Your feeling gulity for no reason at all he enjoyed it so dont let it bother you|`|dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	I never knew there had to be a good reason... I think you are hormonal and pregnant...eat some ice cream and move on...
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Yea...  and is this a dream you often have? <br>  <br>  I feel sorry for your wife who by the way I hope is doing the exact same thing!|`|RBQrgByeaa	I have the three-strike rule. If I get turned down three times in a row for sex, side action is legit.<br>  <br>  There's always a batter on deck, too.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	If she slaps you on the butt and says.. YEEHHAWW!!<br>  <br>  Than you have the green light for side action!!|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	I tell ya what.  You test that out for all of us men out here in Yahoo-land.  When you come back, whether it be happy and satisfied, or broken and beaten with a heel protruding from your skull, let us know how that worked.  We'll watch with baited breath.|`|UJD2eYebaa	How about Wifey says:<br>  <br>  "Oh Georgio...don't be surprised but you stopped being the favorite so long ago!!"|`|IvMPh09baa	you stink.|`|1899aea197e9521ce9a275c00c477c75aa	Hon.. be so ever careful with this.  She might say yes... but it might also eat at her and cause problems later even if you never do it.  It is a box once opened ... it will not be able to be shut and may cause so many other problems that are impossible to for see right now.   Take care.   crone.|`|AA12095067	I guess if you both agree to it, then it's okay.<br>  <br>  I would wonder why my spouse was so eager for me to take myself elsewhere. <br>  <br>  In your case, maybe you already know?|`|cF3FbVofaa	OMG!  That is too much!  I'm tellin' ya, thank god it's a slow night in the E.R and I was able to read your questions..I hope they don't notice me laughing to myself over here..Classic!  :o)|`|p8RvGtNYaa	You must be Republican|`|dprURFLxaa	I always have a mix tape on hand for when the same old tunes get boring.|`|7fAHPUkkaa	true, yet another interesting question, i'm going to try that one|`|Awywcn2Caa	If you and wifey got it worked out, the who else is to say?|`|n8lXItGraa	Yeah right...good luck with that one buddy!   And what are YOU smoking this evening?|`|1d709148a53b6e2e7a4c50cec7acddddaa	When you entered into a monogamous relationship there is a level of assumption by both parties that neither will stray physically from the other. However, if both parties agree that seeing others on the side is OK then it is. So, its OK to ask her and if she agrees its OK to side sample. However, if you ask and she doesn't agree and still side sample you are in the wrong. If  you don't ask and side sample you again are in the wrong. Approach her and ask. Obviously your needs are not being fulfilled if you are on yahoo asking this questions. Be honest with yourself and her.|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	What is it with you and side action?  Why did you even get married? Are you for real? Now answer those questions.|`|2uhKJ9OSaa	Good luck! Just have a 3 some!!|`|7aoHmM4baa	false
Awywcn2Caa	After I had our first child, He kissed me on the forehead and said thank you. My husband is a very quite guy who rarely shows his feelings so it was very shocking and sweet for him to do!|`|hjc2y3TMaa	He has taken care of the finances for us for 13 years. He also gave me 3 children but most especially--the last child. He was done, I wanted more--he let me have my way. He has since gotten a vasectomy but still...|`|7aoHmM4baa	he told me close your eyes you have something there ,let me take it off<br>  <br>  when i closed my eyes<br>  he kissed me<br>  <br>  <br>  that was soooooooooooooooooooo romantic|`|HUvcQvQYaa	Well I've never had a wife or a gf but I have commed on a hookers face. Does that count?|`|8j7FCEOraa	He proposed to me on a waterfall in Jamaica, on a vacation he paid for as my Christmas present.<br>  <br>  Very sweet, but sometimes... I'd just like having the dishes done HAha!|`|IvMPh09baa	I would have to think about it... but first thing that comes to my head is last year I was really really sick for a week and couldn't get out of bed.  He took care of me, and then he ordered me some clothes online and had them delivered the next day as a surprise.  He bought me a cute top that he picked out himself.  its was sweet he tried and surprised me and it actually made me feel better.
bo4MguzVaa	I would say, if you are going to marry me and I'm going to be your other half, then you have to be able to trust me with what burdens you.  Tell him you are his partner, his team mate, and God never meant for man to "go it alone", that's why he created woman.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	The problem with that is he is displaying behavior that some thing is  wrong and it is bothering you. Maybe you could ask him if it has any thing do to with you and him. Yes there may be things that are just between us and God, but if it is affecting the relationship communication is a big part of a good relationship and since he is your fiance it doesn't really get things off to a good start in communication for the future.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	there are somethings that Guys have to deal alone. if he doesn't he just doesn't feel like a Man. im not saying guy's deal things in solitude 100% of the time. but i am saying some stuff needs to be dealt alone and alone only. leave him be...|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	tell him that u married each other because of trust and love. but u still understand if its personal|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	All people (in or out of relationships) have their own, personal struggles.  And even though you and your guy are going to get married, some things are private; however, it's not really "fair" to you if he's going around like sad-sack all the time.  Apparently, he can't separate his personal issue from your relationship.<br>  <br>  I think that, if it's that devistating, you will be informed sooner or later.<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, if you let his mood control your emotions, you will be unhappy too.  <br>  <br>  I'd say leave it alone and find more constructive, positive things to focus on for now|`|DYnvacFVaa	I think i read a post of yours where you said you sent an email to your mother in law regarding some flowers and apparently everyone got pretty upset about it, maybe he is upset that your new mother in law is upset, he might be worried about this?|`|6OzEsanAaa	maybe i would hate to say this..but i maybe hes cheating on you? i hope not! dont get me wrong! but you never know<br>  <br>  i think that you should give him some space try not to keep bugging him about it! <br>  act like you dont caree<br>  he will come around?
YxABWksZaa	no but you were kind of an *** to him and i dont blame him for being upset. plus now hes pissed cuz youre with someone else and he had a thing for you|`|RRzcbvvXaa	well he sounds nice. he problu got jealous that you are with another guy now, cuz im sure he likes you which is why he was mad when he found out you were kidding about the friends with benefits. but im not really sure if hes after one thing. maybe you should give him a chance and if he is, you can end the relationship.|`|PFLfqYfhaa	It could be that or it could be that he was angry because he wanted to take the relationship further and you didn't at the time.He is now angry because u were talking to another guy. Trust me guy get jealous all the time ththat's he asked if u compared him with others. u need to tell him how u feel. Good Luck!|`|l57BE2JTaa	i diagree with the first person <br>  <br>  say sorry i miss talking to you and i want things ti be the same again and i like you adn ONLY you i want you and Only you and so on lol|`|WHUPPVFtaa	he dont want u|`|4sTDtz7kaa	He really liked you!|`|Jw3VExIpaa	probably but who can blame him!?|`|dHeMxnp2aa	he wants to have sex but he also wants to be the only guy for you to give it to him, and wen he sees that wen ur older or sumthing ur giving that to other guys he'll be like LAY OFF MY GIRL shes MY sex toy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
nYnlQPu1aa	Ok whatever it happened to him it is sad but I am sure he will find his family and if he heard that the family that he lives with told that they don't want to keep him tell him to talk to that family.  You are a good friend for him whatever that you can do is whatever you are doing now and don't worry for him. Every thing going to be all right.|`|VWvI5RyBaa	One thing I know for sure is that if he talks about it you really have to let him talk and be a very good and caring listener.  However, don't mention anything if he doesn't.  It is really up to him to decide the time when he wants to talk about it since it's his problem.  I'm 47 and I understand what it is to get attached to somebody.  I'm happily married, have three children and I talk to many younger people on the Internet and I would want to adopt them all.  What I believe you should do if he tells you that it hurts him that they don't want to adopt him is to tell him that they love him for sure since they wanted to do it before but it's not their fault, they just don't have the money due to the worldwide problem with the economy.  Adoption is nice but it's a piece of paper, if they treat him well and love him, that's what that counts.  It's what is in their heart.  Tell him to try to put himself in their shoes, they must be as devastated as he is since they wanted to adopt him.  It's really the thought that counts.  If he can stay with them, they will always be his family with the papers or not.  Tell him that one day he will have his own family, a wife and kids if he wants and he will have a chance to experience something wonderful, something he will appreciate truly instead of people who take marriage and children for granted and don't have a good relationship with their wife and children.  All good things come to people who wait.  Who knows, maybe the economy will turn around fast and they will be able to adopt him after all.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	comfort him and stuff when hes feeling down and deff dont bring it up. when hes talking about it and u see him getting sad then change the topic and talk about happy things.
AA12398373	So do you want to know what's wrong with you?<br>  NOTHING!<br>  You are NOT crazy. Your reaction to the breakup of your family is perfectly understandable. Of course you are angry, and who wouldn't cry at such a devastating loss?<br>  <br>  It seems like everyone else has run off to take care of their own agenda, and left you in a corner with your grandma like a forgotten old pair of tennis shoes.<br>  <br>  NOT FAIR!<br>  <br>  To make things worse, it seems like they put the blame on you when you feel bad about all of this.<br>  <br>  That's not fair either!<br>  <br>  You have suffered a serious loss. It's not too unlike the kind of loss you would feel if there was a death in the family. In a way there was a death in the family, it may not have been one of your family members who died, but it definitely was the death of the family unit.<br>  Therefore, you could probably use some grief councilling.<br>  <br>  Be kind to yourself, talk to someone who can lend a sympathetic ear, and things will seem to improve after that.<br>  <br>  Nobody's going to hate you, so please don't shoot yourself in the head. OK?|`|v1A9lxuzaa	you have a family, yes at the moment they're at the end of the phone but face it, people need to do their own thing in life - including you.

You can meet new friends from school/college and work. Make a family group for yourself out of your friends and their families.
mpGjPV6Xaa	It's completely normal sweety. It's just your hormones that causes you<br>  to get horny. Everybody goes through this phase, but some people tend to get horny more than others. So, you don't have nothing to worry about, it's perfectly normal that you get like that.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped !!!<br>  <br>  Joseph D : )|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Yes, it probably is and probably most people would have noticed it.  <br>  <br>  Humans have it inbuilt to think these things (love, relationships etc) are desirable and important - if we didn't, there might be no babies, families and future generations.  It is part of growing up and becoming an adult.  Chemicals in the body (including the brain) are responsible for this, as well as us wanting to eat, reacting to fear, hot or cold etc.  That is not to say love is not special and important, but what you are feeling is part of being human.  Studies say little things that people aren't even aware of affect the type of person they fall in love with.<br>  <br>  What I would say is be careful and my advice would be not to act too much on it now in your teen years (even if it feels right and good and you think you are ready, these feelings can get you into trouble if you let them or don't realise how strong they can feel sometimes).  Having a boyfriend can be one of the best feelings, but don't let anyone tell you that acting on these desires is what you are supposed to do, or you are not normal.  All the media today about sex being good and everywhere does not help.  While not having that there won't stop people thinking about these things, it is not the right message.  In some cultures and times, these things are not talked about, but that does not change the fact that it is normal to have feelings like this.  Good luck.|`|uLHtXibRaa	Yes i do and yes its what you'd describe as horny..and yes..its very very normal...it will settle as your hormones do but you will still get these feelings from time to time maybe a lot..but this is still normal and we all have those feelings..its just the way we choose to deal witth hem thats all...|`|t2sTqzu9aa	Yeah, it's to do with hormones. It's normal.|`|TyRjrSWLaa	well it most likely is that ur horny. its normal for teens to be horny alot you just gotta learn to controll it. itll take some time so dont worry to much. play with yourself sometimes if your still a virgin and i believe you are and there is nothing wrongwith that. itll happen alot youll get horny and have that feeling and its natural so yea if it becomes too much just excuse urself and handle sme business you will feel alotbetter when you do k<br>  <br>  goodluck and hang in there;)|`|3KAiV9zTaa	Yeah you are. This is only a mild feeling. The really serious ones when you're horny or whatever can get you to where your entire body starts shaking, and the tinkling feeling is just everywhere! Don't feel bad...i get like that too lol. I love the feeling and the feeling of satisfaction feels even better!|`|4sTDtz7kaa	Yes, it is total normal to be having those feeling. Your body is growing up and changing also, so you are in the age that; that is all you want to do.|`|DPG0dhTEaa	yes it is totally normal, because at your age your hormones are going crazy. i am in the field of biology in college and im saying it is all right to have the "horny" feeling and things a like.|`|PFLfqYfhaa	Lol, its totally normal its just that your body and mind are changing even more so now that you re a teen. Just relax and don't freak out about it, it'll go away soon enough, you'll be fine. Good Luck, hope i helped!!|`|Qnswjc6kaa	No, that is NOT NORMAL.

YOu deserve the truth, so actually you shouldn't have to ask it.  <br>  <br>  Honestly, sounds to me like you think he is already guilty and your not going to listen to what the truth might be.  Listen, listen listen to him.  Just ask him what happened in all honesty... thats all you need to ask... then let him do the talking.

[after 24 yrs married my husband in the mideast admitted he saw a prostitute, i am devestated.] he denied it all of '08 then admitted it finally. say 'honey i'm not going to make a big thing about it, i just want to know ----' you know it could be he din't do anything.|`|HE56Jra6aa	If their all friendly... Think twice about your questions. If he can't come clean. Go to the source of the problem... The girl. Go talk to her and find out what he told her. Chances are... He may have done more than you think.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	Refuse him any attention until he fesses up.  Don't cook him dinner, hell, don't even set a place for him at the table.  This is serious.

MYO2k9EUaa	Send her an anonymous gift basket filled to the brim with sweet smelling things like soap, shampoo, deodorant, body wash... etc. if its all that important to you. Should give her a hint...|`|aC6O7vlNaa	that sounds gross!<br>  <br>  instead of telling her "You stink!" about her smelly breath, offer her mint candy. when she's around, eat one or two and offer her, "Want some?"<br>  <br>  outside class, tell her about the hot perfume you just bought at the mall yesterday. tell her that it smells so good and you really like it. and then suggest her to buy it too, "You should get it. I know you'll like it!"|`|P7rosHBNaa	Maybe bring a new perfume to school, and say hey I just got this do you want to try it, or bring some mints to school and ask her if she wants some.|`|EFD4TASAaa	tell her..<br>  <br>  NOT TO BE RUDE BUT YOU SMELL. CAN I HELP YOU LIKE BUY YOU DEODORANT OR SOMETHING. I DONT WANT TO BE MEAN, BUT YOU NEED TO FIX THAT PROBLEM.

I know this answer sounds bad but just trying to help! And I hope this helps!!!|`|DqzhHZnoaa	talk to your teacher about it<br>  tell her its affecting your health & etc<br>  but try to keep it descreet<br>  like before/after class<br>  <br>  and if anyone asks, just say you need to be closer to the teacher or something|`|xUNmNk6paa	tell her its better to tell her straight out cuz then at least she knows, or if its just her breath get some good mints or gum and offer her 1 when u sit down
OT6ybbhtaa	Hooking up with someone forms a spiritual connection with that person... the more people you've hooked up with, the weaker it is, but its always there to some degree. Thats why you feel that way.<br>  Also, when you like a person, missing them generally happens alot...<br>  sorry but no cure for it.<br>  other than to be with them.<br>  <br>  If he's in college, and a relationship just isn't gonna work out right now, then find someone else to give your body and effections to. <br>  The only way you can help yourself is to just get over him.<br>  or you could wait for him for a few years, if he really means that much to you.<br>  but... people change don't they? They can chose to just walk away even if you've given them your whole body, mind, and heart. And theres nothing you can do about it. Its their choice. they have a right to it. <br>  sooo... I'd say waiting for him is rather risky... and you're betting with your heart.<br>  p.s. your situation sounds a bit dangerous... what if he hooks up with some skank drunk party girl, gets some nice STD's and gives them to you???? =O not pretty...|`|ahBgJtVUaa	I'm not sure. If you can drive and the collage is close (less then around 1 hour) maybe drive up there every Sunday.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure if it is far you might have to get over him because long distance relationships never last.<br>  <br>  Sorry! You could also try like getting into the same school if you really have big feelings about him.|`|RbBbNh0Maa	If your relationship or whatever you wanna call it is going okay, i wouldn't worry about it. Let things go as they are and see what happens when he gets out school. If loves you or ends up loving you everything will work out just fine.|`|yWA1jlJPaa	i think you should definitely talk to him about it and tell him how u feel. another option is that u should wait a week and see if u still have the same feeling of missing him<br>  it could just be a temporary feeling cuz u just saw him recently|`|MWWUPWNiaa	Okay Hun  the best advice I can give is to wait till your off to college. I mean I bet this guy is "different" and hes "not" playing you or anything but you need to think realistically he could be playing a whole bunch of under classmen. Be smart, Think wise. If you have to go see HIM. If he is serious about the relationship he'll love the effort. Seems like you are seriously liking this guy but remember guys will be guys and try not to get your heart broken. Hope I help=]|`|Bx2w3h0faa	You shouldnt let it eat on your shoulder.<br>  <br>  I mean i can understand why you have feelings for the guy, your attracted to him, but yet he goes to college so that makes you want to see him even more cause hes kinda unavailible.<br>  <br>  But really when it all comes down to it, if its really meant to be that you 2 will start a relationship witheachother, most likely he is gonna chase you down. Because if he wants you bad enough he will start one with you.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	You should ask if you can date him and only him or say something to that extent and if he feels the same way them maybe you guys should take you relationship to the next level...|`|WvBgXv5daa	tell ur best friend everything youve written down, ask her to find out if hes into you! she should really be honest with you tell her that if he is build up ur self esteem and ask him out!|`|qL3dGTXDaa	Looks as if you two are in agreement which is unusual these days. I would however be available for new opportunities as your current situation is not going to go anywhere other than what it is currently.
JtcWfQ1uaa	Do you have a cell phone cuz you could take it and everytime he calls answer. I have an 8 and 6 year old and freak out even when their at their friends house. I wish I could be there all the time but know that is not possible. you should ask your dad to let you go an if you dont answer or call right back then next time you wont go. Good Luck.|`|GqTSa85daa	Have your friends Grandma talk to him.|`|biKMQ2I1aa	Sorry, but you do sound quite young and your father loves you. He is not being overprotective. Also, if he has a language barrier it is more difficult for him since he can not easily speak with the grandmother. What is Knotts? I am not familiar with it. You sound like you are about 13. You may just need to be a bit older for him to feel ok with you going place.|`|DzunYgWOaa	Have you father meet your friends grandma, and maybe she can reassure your father.|`|1OEDcz6Raa	tell your friends grandma to call your dad and talk with him.|`|V74T9JnUaa	let me guess your asian???|`|1fX5RQKuaa	well i totally understand, when i was growing up my dad was very over protected with me. my friends would have sleep overs and i was always invited but i could never go. my dad was mexican from mexico so he was old school, plus i was the only girl. maybe if your friend's grandma talks to your dad and gives him a cell number where he can call whenever, it might let him relax and trust her that your in good hands.|`|wKCZ6b80aa	I think you should ask you friend's grandma to talk with you father...ask her to explain the truth to your father....and let your friend's grandma slow talk with your father...|`|AOYYvxXlaa	Wait he falls asleep and take a a syringe full of drano and inject him in the left arm, then use an axe and cut his legs off.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	let him meet ur friends grandma or have ur dad bring just u and ur other friends can go with ur friends grandma
mYAbq6fnaa	it sounds to me like she doesnt feel like putting any effort into the friendship. shes probably really lazy and expects you to do all of the work to maintain the friendship. she needs to start pulling her weight. a friendship takes two to work. like you said, she would probably not call you for weeks, and it sounds like she just goes with you to have fun and to have something to do, but other than that she just doesnt care. i may be wrong, but thats what it sounds like. talk to her about it and ask her why she does this. good luck!:)|`|manL9Xcwaa	i've had friendships like that i know how annoying it is. you shouldn't take it personal shes probabaly just a lazy person and doesn't put effort in too her friendships. you should talk to her about it and tell her its bothering you.<br>  hope it gets better!
TqtGoPy3aa	Instead of just being there for her and listening to her and just being a good friend try flirting alot and sometimes its okay to be a little forward. Show her that you can offer more than just friendship. If she ignores you then ignore her trust me girls dont like to be ignored and it will probably make her want you more!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps good luck!|`|zrFaC7aHaa	maybe u should tell her...maybe she's just never thought of you like that but if you tell her it could go both ways: one, she could finally start to see you as more than a friend and maybe start liking you but two, it could also ruin you "friendship". bc sometimes girls find it awkward or weird if they find out one of their guy friends likes them...believe me i no....so i guess if i were you, id enjoy her friendship for a while and if nothing changes in a few weeks, honestly tell her how  you feel.|`|OT6ybbhtaa	Be really creative, and think of a cute romantic way to tell her... like a scavenger hunt, or with secret notes... idk something cool!<br>  <br>  If she doesn't like you back, relax. I know it doesn't seem like it, but if thats the case, she's not worth it, and you deserve better.<br>  <br>  I would know a guy liked me if he was doing everything your doing... maybe she does know... hmm...|`|8u33EV0Daa	well just tell her and if she and ask her on a date<br>  if she rejects then.. try to get over her. asap|`|gKhR0sgLaa	Don't let her know that you like her by straight out telling her, it could cause things to be awkward. She might like you back, but is shy, so she avoids you because she is nervous about what could happen. You have to be the one to be more flirtatious with the girl. Show her that you aren't like other guys, and make her want you. I usually do this by flirting with a girl by busting her balls, but both having fun with it. A lot of girls will have fun with you if you do this, and it will seem that you aren't that interested, and she will start to wonder why you are being "mean" to her, in other words, you are on her mind. Then she might start to want to spend more time with you because you are so fun to be with.|`|ahBgJtVUaa	i was like that with my now GF. <br>  <br>  Try playing this great game where you ask each other questions and you have to answer the questions truthfully. Ask her if she likes anyone, if she says yes keep asking her who and sooner or later she will say if not say like can you tell me at the end of the school year. If it isn't you try to get over her or try just asking her out.|`|IpWTMetHaa	The best thing you can do for a girl is be kind, as you are to this friend of yours.<br>  <br>  But friendship is a two-way street, and if she cannot also give you what is received, what would be the point of continuing this???|`|KpiCMmmVaa	aww :/ you seem like a really nice guy.<br>  jus do more things to make her notice you.<br>  give her compliments randomnly in the hall and walk off, jus say that thats all.shell be thinking bout you then|`|nzAaOK0Kaa	You sound like such a great guy to know and just tell her the last sentence that you wrote cause if i had i guy like you, i would secretly like you so maybe shes the same|`|HNAVlwV7aa	i  think u should tell her how u feel. if she doesn't feel the same way, just ask her to forget about it and continue with the friendship. tell her you'll do the same and then live ur life.|`|9fckfc2eaa	you can start by telling her everything u just sed if she listens to u she is a good friend if she doesnt listen to u then she doesnt like u ....|`|yClDKeKGaa	your gonna have to tell her somehow, by dropping pretty subtle hints or just plan out coming clean and if she doesn't feel the same way theres plenty of other fish in the sea you just gotta be patient|`|Yh9Zbz9Taa	just tell her how u feel<br>  and ask her out<br>  see wat happens<br>  good luck!|`|3llK5y7Baa	she sounds kind of like a b***. are you sure she is not using you??|`|13KBWzBXaa	This girl will not be your wife.<br>  You will not spend the rest of your life together.<br>  This is the age to begin to learn how to seek a mate.<br>  Instead of asking strangers how to go about doing what you want to do, just do some trial and error seeking of YOUR style and your methods.<br>  What worked for me may not work for you.<br>  <br>  I am an older guy and could offer step-by-step advise, but truthfully, in the long haul, your decisions in the matter of your heart will serve you much better than any schemes or tricks you may glean from these sites.<br>  <br>  I will share this thought: Honesty, although often difficult, is always better than trickery and deceit.
IxoBFCpTaa	? Usually, it should say something like that. <br>  <br>  ? Yes; if you choose it to be that way, they should protect the children. You may want to double-check with an attorney, I am no professional.
vxPrPsD2aa	If both of you are into having a lasting relationship, it should be fine. I'm currently engaged to someone in the Corps, and it DOES get hard at times, but it is well worth it. Not all military guys cheat, that is a HUGE lie. Also, they know that they can get dishonorably dishcharged if they have sex or any sexual relations with someone on a deployment (Like to Iraq or Afghanistan). They also know that if they are married and get caught cheating, they can get sent to the brig, NJP'd, demoted, and half a months pay. Don't let these people get into your head that ALL military guys cheat, because it's not a matter of them being in a military; it's if the guys is RESPECTFUL and loves you enough to NOT cheat.  It's hard for them to cope with being away from someone for such a long period of time (CACS, being in the field, deployments). If you both have enough love for each other, you should be fine. It takes a lot of work though. It's not all sunshine and butterflies. I've been with my Marine for a year, and we've had so many ups and downs it's crazy. During stressful times while he's away, he may take his frustrations, lack of sleep, and bad days out on you. But communication is the key! Let him know you understand where he's coming from, without sounding like you're complaining to him. Let him know how it makes you feel when he does things like that. While he's deployed to anywhere, send packages, make sure you let him know that you are there waiting for his arrival back, with open arms. Write him as much as possible. Even if it's just a letter telling him you love him, do it! He needs your support 24/7, whether he'll tell you or not because Marines tend to play a 'macho man' game where they think they are super tough. You gotta be strong for him while he's gone, and strong for yourself. You're going to have days where you just don't wanna get out of bed, or go about your daily business because you miss him so much. But you gotta keep on trucking in those times. Deployments seem long, but the time just flies on by. However, if things have always been unsteady between you two, make sure you know when enough is enough if it ever gets out of hand (taking his frustrations out on you, things like that). Make sure you give him time to vent if he needs to. And keep in mind he's around guys basically 90 percent of the time, so let him know what's an acceptable joke/conversation with you, and what's not acceptable.<br>  It's hard work, so make sure you both are ready to be married with his new lifestyle before you get married. It's hard hard job to be a military spouse, but in the end, all the deployments, fights, arguements and what not, are all worth it. Because the second you see him get back from a long deployment; that first kiss when you see him, is gonna be like the first time you kissed him all over again. (Mine's coming home from a 7 month deployment from Iraq in 10 days, so sorry if it's all mushy gushy lol.) <br>  In a nutshell; it's hard work, but worth it and let him know that you are always going to support him, and that you are always waiting for him to return from any time away from you, and that you love him. Oh and during deployments, I find the care packages are really fun! And those phone calls you get at 4 am will make you smile for days on end. Enjoy what time you have together, and enjoy the fact that you are with a United States Marine! <br>  <br>  Semper Fi|`|AA11605508	Make sure you have your own life, interests and hobbies.  He'll be deployed a lot, and if you're one of those women who doesn't exist without a man, you're going to have a lot of problems. <br>  <br>  Another thing you should consider is that you're not marrying just him, you're marrying the Marine Corps. His work may take priority over his family life a lot of times, and you need to know when you'll accept this and when you're going to say this is an issue.|`|kV9GlWDFaa	SUP? lol hi i'm married to a marine! and believe you me things are not quite perfect. there are times well most of the time that he is away. it can be difficult i promise however through all the difficulties them boys are not all bad. Some of them just wanted to do something with thier lives and take a pretty lady with them you know? I admit some military guys are assholes but i promise you if you got a good one then just stay constant in his everyday life. simple reminders that you are here thinking about him and yall's future life together. Him acting wierd shouldn't automactically be something to register in your head. for gawds sake them boys are endured to alot of unecessary actives like hardcore **** you know. maybe he just had a rough day at work. think about the simple obvious answers and quit digging too deep i promise it causes more harm than anything.

I am married to a soldier and know lots of them.  It is hard at times since they are gone a lot, and they do change a lot after training.  Talk to him about how he feels to make sure you two are still on the same page, and if you are than express to him how you want to work on and maintain your bond together.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|iD4ejChZaa	it is very very difficult, i would say one out of 40 married men doesn't cheat, plenty of prostitutes in the mideast and lots of booze. the philipines is worse. don't marry any military guy.|`|mCM363I9aa	it's not only hard for you but just imagine how hard it is for him, I believe that he needs your full support.

LyYU5bybaa	i know this might seem like an awkward thing at the moment..but you have to come to terms with the fact that she is a lesbian..its not a disease..<br>  <br>  it might seem hard to think of it as a normal thing..but no body really thiks of it as a scary freaky thing..someones sexuality is not their personality..she still cares for you and still loves you..she is your mom..your mother..she loves you more than any one else in the whole world..and she always will no matter what..<br>  <br>  if you kissed a girl your mother would be a little worried at first but then she would accept it and understand that you like girls, why can't you do the same. just please don't be cruel to her, and tell her you understand, talk to her about it, it will defintely make you feel better about it.<br>  <br>  You might be thinking about school and what your friends would say if they find out about your mom being a lesbian..well you can tell everyone that you're proud of it..and then they will stop saying anything to you..<br>  <br>  take care..gud luck..and i hope you don't do or say anything you will later regret<br>  stay with her.she is your mom and she loves you..being a lesbian doesn't change that..<br>  byeeeeeeeeeee|`|hY11vYcpaa	Yes, I think you should leave your mom.

What she does in the bedroom is her business and none of yours.  I think it's time you grow up and think about how much you would hurt your mom if you left her.<br>  <br>  If my mom was a lesbian, I would be proud.|`|EQh9GZpXaa	OK, just because you are against homosexuality doesnt mean you should leave your mom, she took care of you and gave you love all those years and this is how you would repay her?, confront her about it, and make sure what you're thinking is right, dont jump to conclusions, and from there do what ever feels right I guess|`|Ek5ZjYmhaa	Hmmm... thats a tough situation.

She's still your mother & if her sexual preferences are different to what you expect of her how is that hurting you? As for leaving her house? That's ridiculous, it's as though you feel like you are going to catch something from her. You don't mention your father or any male relationship she might be in? Maybe she's been hurt by men because a lot of women turn to women for that reason. If she's happy then let her be happy. At least give her a chance to explain without judging her too harshly.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	If my mom was a lesbian I would love her, just like I do now.  And I'd support her, just like I do now.

Your mom is still your mom. Shes still the woman who cares deeply for you guys and you cant judge her sexuality. You should discuss this with her, I dont believe letting this go will help anything.

If she is a piece of crap mother then im sorry she is that way and I wouldnt recommend running away because times get tough and the floor I slept on when that happened to me was uncomforting.

ErIxYrxlaa	hahahahah do i know you ? <br>   <br>  i do the same thing occasionally , either its an act <br>  or he really is an insecure guy...<br>  since he knows you like him and hes into you well <br>  could mean a few things <br>  <br>  1. he is actually insecure and likes the attention from <br>  you without being in a serious relationship <br>  <br>  2.he's playing you<br>   (dont even bother if this is the case , he wont EVER ask you out)<br>  <br>  basically he could be lying to you but to answer your question <br>  <br>  just wait it out , if he doesnt ask you out cuz nervous or shy or something than you ask him or move on simple as that|`|YxABWksZaa	just do it yourself jeesh i dont see why you think you cant|`|lz6vAjSEaa	ask him out maybe|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I think that you should turn up the flirting and maybe talk to him more on the phone, myspace, facebook as much as you can and hopefully he will get your drift...I don't think that he is insicure per say but more like scared if you are his first girlfriend it takes a lot for a guy to ask out a girl...|`|OuJ9qQxoaa	I like corndogs.|`|KrpnKhFTaa	are YOU better looking than HIM? Then YOU ask HIM out!|`|rcTXMM6Naa	If i were you i would patiently wait. Maybe he has feelings for you, but he also has feelings for this other girl, he is trying to decide who he likes more. If he is insecure, just give him time. He might be a little nervous, and he probably wouldnt have asked you out unless he knew you liked him for a fact. Which, your already showing, so that step is done. If I were you I would just wait it out. It will actually set your mind straight. If you get over him by the time he does or doesnt ask you out, the relationship wouldnt have lasted on your end anyways. If you did still like him, you must really like him, and really want to be with him, so it will last. Hope this helped good luck (:|`|Goxj1meyaa	you should ask him out to go hang out like friendly things and gradually start spending more time with him, talk to him and become good friends... then find out whether he still likes the other girl and if he still likes you... then make your outings more and more intamite until you are going out to movies, you may still be friends but he will have gotten to know you so he wont be so insecure and if he still likes you he will ask you out.  <br>  if not then at least you will have a new friend... <br>  :)|`|0NlFBcFpaa	if he's not confident enough to show or prove to you the fact that he likes you; well then sorry honey, but he doesn't like you at all enough.<br>  <br>  plus, you said he likes another girl. right there you know that you're not all he cares about. <br>  <br>  i know it's unfortunate to think about, but you need to move on. when a guy doesn't respond to flirting or act on his feelings towards you...well forget it. he's not worth it. oh and he's not insecure...he just may not like you. sorry.|`|w4XbSuB5aa	I am one of those insecure guys I'm afraid, you should just ask him out, this girl did that too me and i had no choice but to say yes.

qRKOWgS0aa	It's hard enough to make local relationships work, but having miles, States, and sometimes even an ocean between you makes it even more difficult. However, successful long distance relationships can and do exist. Here's how to give yours every chance to survive and thrive<br>  <br>  Ask the important questions at the onset, to make sure you are both clear on the parameters of the relationship. Setting parameters such as naming your relationship (dating, seeing each other, boyfriend/girlfriend, engaged)as well defining exclusive(limited to one person,) non exclusive. These can be difficult and awkward questions to ask, but will save you great heartache and misunderstanding down the line. Example: "Are you open to the possibility of relocating if the relationship should it become more serious?" or "What are you looking to get out of the relationship?". Stating your end goal or ideas will allow each person to maintain what they need. <br>  Do things together. Defy the distance. As a long distance couple, it's important to do other things together besides the usual phone call. In a long distance relationship, interaction over the phone can become dull in the long run. Incorporating other forms of interaction are important. Just think... people in short-distance relationships do not spend the majority of their time talking, but rather doing things with each other. Try to replicate this by finding things to do together such as watching a TV show or movie simultaneously. <br>  <br>  Communicate in some way every day, more than once if possible. Since you won't be seeing each other, it's important to establish and maintain an emotional connection. These don't always have to be long, in-depth conversations. Tell each other about your little triumphs and tragedies. Ask for advice. Use an instant messenger program or VoIP for real-time chat, or web cams for that visual connection. E-mail is great so make sure you use it, especially if long-distance phone calls put a strain on your budget. Remember that e-mail and even instant messengers can increase the possibility of misunderstandings. Write love letters. Send small gifts or flowers for no reason. In this case, quantity is as important as quality. You may discover an advantage over others whose partner is close at hand - you don't take communication for granted! <br>  Take advantage of the benefits a long distance relationship offers: more time with friends and/or family, no arguments over toothpaste caps, the pleasure of seeing your sweetheart again after a long absence, time to mull your options (rather than snapping at your partner impulsively) before you respond to that email s/he wrote that seemed so rude the first time you read it, etc. Most important, being far apart gives you a chance to maintain your individuality - something that can get lost in the shuffle when couples spend all their free time together. <br>  Pursue common interests, even if it means pursuing them apart. If there's a movie you're both interested in seeing, watch it individually and then call each other afterward and talk about it. Read a certain book at the same time. Stargaze while you're on the phone. Set your watches to go off at the same time every day, and synchronize your alarm with that of your partner. Make it a point to think of each other when your watch goes off, and revel in the fact that he or she is thinking about you, too. Find creative ways to bond. <br>  Avoid the temptation to be controlling. People have free will and no one can or should control another person. As long as you are both interested in being in the relationship, you will stick with it and distance will not make a difference. As soon as one of you decides the other is not a good match - or someone else is a better match - your relationship ends, whether you live 3000 miles apart, two streets over, or share the same bed with your wedding picture on the wall. You are going to have to trust each other completely if this relationship is going to work. <br>  Talk about your future together. Assuming that ultimately you'd want to live together, discussing how you're going to get to that point will help you prove to each other that the relationship is going somewhere and that your efforts and frustrations are not in vain. <br>  Know when to say good-bye. While this is tough in any relationship, this can be especially hard over long distances. When communication becomes one-sided or sparse for too long and for no apparent reason, when arguments (yes, you'll have them) become too frequent, when the whole thing just seems like more trouble than it's worth, it's time to re-evaluate the relationship. You have to remember that for a healthy relationship, no matter how far or close, you must be willing to let go. <br>  Remember: things will get better with time, and even the relationship will become better. Have hope. <br>  Visit often Try to make the time to visit each other as often as possible or as often as your budget permits you to. A relationship cannot thrive i|`|KeDY8hNvaa	well my boyfriend was in a whole different country, he had to move there with his family. he was supposed to stay for almost a year. and he was 7 hours ahead of me, so when I got out of school he was pretty much going to bed. but we are together right now, he moved back and it's great.<br>  <br>  we dated and we were barely able to talk, I'm sure your relationship will work out great<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|8YkBjeqQaa	Okay, I'm tired, so these won't be in complete sentences. I hope you don't mind.<br>  <br>  Send lots and lots of emails and letters. Call each other at least once a day. Do those radio love-song dedication shows (like, Delilah, though I'm not sre if you know who that is) and dedicate songs to one another. Call him when you know he can talk for a while and just take a break from your studies and tell him everything you have been doing and how much you miss him. Ask, "hey, can you see the moon? We will never be too far apart as long as we can both look at the moon, and think of each other" (maybe not in those words). Write many love letters and send emails with pictures. Plan trips so you can see each other at least once a year.<br>  <br>  Long distance things can work if both people really mean it and really want to make it work. <br>  <br>  I hope everything works out for you!

Obviously he isn't in to them because you have been dating over a year and have had no infedelity issues (im assuming). No matter where you go or who you date there will always be some one out there that wants what you have. You need to learn to look past your insecurities and learn to trust in you man's feelings for you more than how you feel about yourself. When these whores try flirting with your man when you are around just be nice, smile sweetly, hold his hand or lean on him a bit holding his arm or something, stay in the conversation they are trying to have with him (don't ever feel excluded bc they will try to ignore you) If things are getting too out of hand just grab his hand and tell them i hate to interupt you (again smile sweetly with an obvious too nice smile) but I need to save steal my boyfriend from you for a couple minuetes. I hope you don't mind but its a well intimate matter. (this will work great if you say the save steal part like you almost were going to say save but went with steal instead.) Its kind of like being a nice b***ch, they can't say no but they also can't call you a jealous psycho.. hope this helps.|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Be confidant that he is with you and that he is just being nice to them to not seem like a snob. (If it bothers you if he over does it tell him that he talks to too many girls in front of you and that it bothers you because he is disrespecting you because he does this like you arent there.|`|UVscrbwkaa	Just remember he's yours. :/ Youve been with him a year.. thats quite along time,, im sure he wouldn't waste a whole year for nothing.<br>  Just dont let it bother you.. he obviously really loves you.<br>  I've got my best friends liking my boyfriend, so grant yourself lucky!!|`|nZ4WDCZYaa	Simple. How does he react? The only one that can give you feelings of insecurity is your boyfriend. If he's not , then your insecurity is a lack of trust on your end. Trust him.|`|osusVJk0aa	try to let it go you cant stop anybody from liking him unless you tell everyone that both of you have a nasty infection|`|HRJDrnBRaa	You should invite them to have a threesome. Everyone benefits!|`|OMrSVM98aa	Tell them to stop liking them cause he my bf?|`|RSm8aXgzaa	I would use a situation like that to my advantage.  If anything, it should make you feel great about yourself!  Your boyfriend could have any girl he wants but he chose you!  How special is that?  And if you're around while all these girls are hitting on him, start hanging on his arm and show off that he's yours.  Grab his butt and distract him.  Eventually those other girls will get annoyed and leave.  Have fun!!|`|gKhR0sgLaa	I would think of it like this, "wow, all these girls like him, but he decided to be with me." Until you find out he's cheating on you... Then you would leave him, seeing as he's not worth your time anymore.|`|z5Yn5pJEaa	just as long he doesnt flirt back you dont have a problem.<br>  when you think that a girl is flirting with your boyfriend just casually go up to him and like link arms w/ him or something. letting the other girls now that he's YOURS!|`|urQnRQ4jaa	If he hasn't gone with any of these other girls that have flirted with him then he's a keeper...maybe you should voice your concerns with your boyfriend and tell him that you are insecure when girls flirt around him all the time...|`|a837fcda7bc7018c3521f4366996b5cfaa	If you trust then be proud that it is you that he wants to be with.  Trusting each other will get you through it.|`|RRzcbvvXaa	wow that sucks. i guess thats just part of the package, having a hot guy as your boyfriend is defff gonna attract other girls. you just gotta keep telling yourself that you are the only one he cares about. think about how lucky you are that he is with you and not with any of those girls. and you know that he cares about you because you guys have been together for a while now. over a year is a long time in high school! so be happy :]|`|wwPZwiWwaa	hey, it's ok, most girls feel a little "jealous" when that happens. just make sure he's not into them and ur he's girl, MAKE SURE, don't just let go of him saying "yeah sure sure"<br>  Have him give you good reasons|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Everybody wants to have a "super hot" partner, but most don't understand the "flip side" of being so "lucky."<br>  <br>  Attractive partners will garner lots of outside attention whether you like it or not.  If you can't handle it, shop for less arresting looks.<br>  <br>  The other thing about partnered hotties is the extra "house-broken-ness" that comes with being in a couple.<br>  <br>  Be sure all the attention isn't going "to his head." I liken getting attention while already partnered to the old Aesop fable about the dog with "two bones." Bone in mouth, this dog saw his reflection in the water, thought he was seeing a 2nd dog with a bone in HIS mouth, decided he wanted BOTH bones and ended up dropping the one "real" one in the water where it was lost forever.  See why this resembles stupid guys who stray?<br>  <br>  The best advice I can offer is:  Know your rights. Know your responsibilities, know your limits.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|dTt2gyJgaa	Well girls are always going to flirt with someone elses man...they love flirting with another womans man..just because he has a girl, they want to take him from her like a competition.

qRKOWgS0aa	Be confident. Studies show that confidence is the key to looking good and feeling good. To gain confidence, try writing a list of things you are good at and things that you like about yourself. For instance: <br>  My pretty eyes are complimented often <br>  I have a great personality <br>  I can get along with people easily <br>  I have a lot of friends<br>  <br>  Also, a great way to gain confidence is to join a sport that you are good at, or want to excel in. Not only will this boost your self-esteem, you are guaranteed to make new friends! Boys love when girls are oozing self confidence, but they also like a girl that is humble, so don't get a big head. <br>  Break the touch barrier. The touch barrier is an invisible 'thing' that stops you from interacting physically with a crush. To break it, touch him whenever you can. While talking to him, casually touch him on the shoulder or playfully go up behind him and pull his hood up. Be careful, though. These things (if used extensively) can be annoying to him. <br>  Get to know him. Though we can be quick to want to date random hotties, said hottie could be freaked when you ask him out without even a conversation first. To get a conversation started, talk about him; everybody likes talking about themselves. Talk about your interests, jobs, families, friends, pets, favorite things, you name it. If he is in the same sport as you, or a sport you want to join, voila! More time with Mr. Right. <br>  Slowly start giving him the signs... Joke around with him, to start! Make him laugh and feel himself and comfortable with you. If you are bold enough, ask him to go out with you and your friends to a movie, lunch, or just hanging out at the mall or local park. Look him more in the eyes, but make sure that you don't look at him strangely; this will turn him off. Smile at him when passing in the halls, or give him a playful high five. A few compliments will show him that you are into him. <br>  Find the right time... for him to ask you out. When you are with your friends, the guy might feel awkward to ask you to 'talk privately'. (Wouldn't you?) If he is shy, ask him yourself! The worst thing that could happen is rejection; and when that happens, move on! Its time to go boy hunting again. If he says yes, congrats! It is all you from here on out.|`|2zgv89OQaa	Be friendly but don't overdo it.  It's always good to have eye-contact with the guy.   Just be yourself and be self-assured.  Best of luck!|`|AA11922229	Be honest.|`|XOpP4oRJaa	try to flirt with guys you like|`|RXBb8kx7aa	Notice him, but be yourself. Step a little bit out of your comfort zone, compliment him when he does anything he might want the slightest bit of recognition for, don't shy away from talking to him, but DON'T EVER be something that you're not. Just be you, be happy, and notice him and if he's a decent guy, he'll reciprocate and notice you.|`|YKiS4tefaa	wear revealing clothes unless it is cold . Makeup is always an option.

Why are you wasting your life????  GET OUT FOR THE KIDS SAKE!

Give me a break.  God wont punish you for doing whats right.|`|OlCt6ZCQaa	Yes you should leave. How long is he going to be in prison? Not that it really matters. Christian or not you can not save someone who obviously has no desire to be saved. If 9 years and two kids have made no difference in his life it is unlikely that he has any real desire to get better (although they always say they do in prison). Move on, go to church, pray, try to raise your children the best you can. Try to meet some people at church. They can keep your mind off of him and hopefully introduce you to a nice Christian man who will treat you and your children well. And accusing you of cheating should not be your reason for thinking he is a cheater, the weekends where he did not come home or call should be good enough reason.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! I hope everything works out for you and for him.|`|RPhla0R7aa	He's done it many times and will continue to be a LOSER and it is probably what his entire life is going to consist of.

I think he has proved that to you by now. Being a Christian does not mean that you have to put up with abuse and a criminal husband. Do you really think that God wants you to live this way. It is time for you to get a divorce, move far away and start a new life for yourself and your children. You and your children deserve better than you have been getting. Ask your daughter how she feels and make sure you really listen to her.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Your boyfriend is abusive and has serious insecurity problems. This is not love and the situation is going to get much worse. You are in a dangerous relationship. Get out and go home to your mother, you are not getting along with him either.

He will change, have no doubt about it. But, he will not change for the better. His pattern and his personality are stable over the course of a lifetime.

I guess "the third time's a charm" never worked on you, hon.<br>  <br>  You have all of this hanging over you, but the final question you have is whether or not he's cheating? <br>  <br>  St Jude ... pray hard, and I wish you Godspeed.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	You should have divorced him along time ago but I feel you are waking up now and bascially you are supporting yourself and your kids so why would you even need him you know he will never change so get a divorce and move and show your kids you are a strong women and the god will support you in this matter.  You say you dont want to be seperated but tell me is not jail seperation and he is mentally abusing so why are still putting up with it just because he is a loser and really he has nothing going for him wake up
dFHsAXDMaa	OMG are you serious she is 13 and having sex that is so crazy to me I mean I am a nurse and a mother of 4 kids.. two girls 17 and 15 and two boys 14 and 11. I coach cheering at local school, but it amazes me that all these young girls now a days think the only way to keep a boyfriend is by having sex with him. you are a very smart girl wait until you are married happily. how would you feel if you had sex with a boy at 13 and then a week later he broke upi with you and you had to watch him kiss the next girl in the hallway a school you would feel used, dirty, heart broken and awful that's how. <br>  <br>  As for your friend it is true the girl code is you never date your friends ex, unfortunately it does happen. if you like your boyfriend which i think you are too young to have.... then let it go stop letting it bother you.... and find new friends I am sure you have other friends. spend more time with them she will come back to you eventually when they break up|`|aC6O7vlNaa	gosh, you're 13! you're a year older than me. life's too short. forget it, let it go. let it flow.|`|ikoO9EBmaa	your 13, no one should feel this way. wrong person, wrong time. you'll find better friends and less guys who are *****. good luck :D|`|2ij4wwjgaa	she shouldnt have dated him n the 1st place b/c yall r BFF's but this is another chance 4 u 2 have some1 else...<br>  the boy i gave my 1st kiss 2 started dating 1 of my friends a week later...<br>  but i then started talkin 2 my other best friend who i had met when i was 11 or 12<br>  we began dating and we r married...<br>  and if she acts different then maybe you should find other frineds<br>  u dont need 2 stop talking 2 her<br>  but find others 2 talk 2<br>  jus plz<br>  dont kill urself...|`|v0l1JEloaa	I understand that you're hurting, but have you looked at the positive side of life lately? Think about the good things in life....for instance, you have another boyfriend.  At least you won't be alone all the time.  And maybe you and your friend need to relax and give each other some space for a while.  You all are tense and need to just breath in and find something to do in a calm environment, like go to a park and play frisbee or have a picnic or see a movie.  By the way, how much time do you spend just hanging out with your family?  Do you have any siblings?  Why not spend some time with them like putting a puzzle together? Or find a board-game that you all like to play and when that one's over let them pick a video to watch and make some popcorn?  Do something that takes your mind off of the past pain, and remember that you can still find something to live for.  Don't give up on your life.  Your family needs you.  And your boyfriend needs you.  You're just going through a rough spot.  It will smooth over soon.  Just don't end your friendship with your friend.  You will both just be more hurt than ever.  Maybe she's hurting too? Sometimes people are too hurt too let it out, so she might not be mad at you.  Still, give her some time and space and it will work out.|`|yQ1UfuZWaa	Jesus!!

In fact, this sounds like you're hurting, like major. You need to have someone else to talk to besides your bestfriend. I don't know what kind of bestfriend does this; but maybe this means that you're still in love with your ex, maybe you guys didnt end it off right. Just calm down, and if you lose this bestfriend, you can always find a new one. Sure it'll be hard but youve gotta hang in there.<br>  And maybe when they break up, because I'm sure nothing lasts forever, she'll come back to you.<br>  And you've gotta be ready for that!|`|TCehI17kaa	Please don't feel this way. No one & i mean no one is worth this pain & wanting to die. I understand u are hurt but wanting to die is not the answer.  Hopefully your best friend will see how you feel & will talk to you about it. And yes this is wrong b/c no one is worth killing themselves. Please talk to someone u can trust about how you feel. A grownup a teacher a counselor. Someone from Church. A helpline. As long as you try & get help for this. I hope u be ok & i wish u the best. Please have faith.

It is better to be 18 though rather than 16 yrs old. Mostly because you are still growing up but..hey if you grew up much more mature than most your age..your gonna want a mature man.

He treats me much better than anyone my age would ..and is a real gentleman.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	The real truth is that a 44yr. old man with some who is still in their teens is not emotionally mature. Most of us as we mature we change and want to be with some one who is on our level of life with experience and knowledge. It also is a sign that he does not have the self esteem to be with some one older. That is nothing against you, as you grow and mature in life you will know what I am talking about.

Some teens are mature and can make decisions about sex.  Others cannot.  <br>  <br>  And...from the site avert.org: "your parents don't make the law. Teens can't get around the laws for smoking, drinking or driving because their parents say so, and it's the same with [old men dating teenage girls] this. The age of consent laws always apply, whether you're in love, or you've been together for ages, or you've had sex before."|`|kQA7SbY9aa	In my opinion, it isn't ok. Maybe when she's in her 20's, but not at 16. The difference between 16 and 44...two different times of life. At 44, he's lived on his own, probably had several 'mature' relationships (maybe a marriage or two), maybe some kids, hopefully a career. At 16, she hasn't even begun. And then why is he even looking at a 16 year old girl? How do you look at this man knowing that he wants your underage daughter? Do you let him come over and 'court' her on the couch in your living room or let her go to the movies with him? Have him over for Sunday dinner? Let him have a few beers while she drinks a Pepsi? Let her 'hang out' at his home? And what if she wants to take him to a school dance? <br>  <br>  You say you're 18 so I guess 'legally' you can do whatever you want now. I wish I could understand why your parents think this is ok and I hope all goes well for you, but I just wouldn't let my daughter do this. She would have to be quite a bit older.|`|naequcqlaa	Sorry, but this is totally absurd!  You are not even a legal age, he's old enuf to be your grandfather!  If your parents did agree to this, they really do need their heads examined.  I cannot imagine myself being w/my grandfather.  You are only a child, & you're fully missing out on your childhood.  You need a chance to date guys your own age.  Date a couple of them at least, have some good fun that you need & deserve & I know if you give yourself a chance, you'll realize just how wrong this is & what a bad mistake you really are making.  If for no one else, at least give yourself a chance.  If the other is meant to be, then it w/be.  You do owe it to yourself tho just to see how the "real world" lives & loves.

IF anybody had a problem with it and turned him in he would be in jail for child molestation.  I would personally petition to keep him there.<br>  <br>  As far as morally- Yes, molesting children is morally wrong, no matter who you are or what you believe.  A 14 year old girl is too young to know any better than her young heart, and can too easily be bought with gifts and false truths.<br>  <br>  I am all for folks being happy, but I personally find the 18 - 44 age gap to bit a bit troubling.  Sure you can get along fine, and all is legal, but this guy must be pretty immature to find anything attractive about such a young woman comparatively.  To me honestly, even though 18 is a legal adult, I think that for a man of his age and experience to be attracted to a woman so much young is still pedophilic.  If he can be that attracted and compatible with an 18 year old, there is nothing that would make mme believe he wouldn't go after a 16 year old, or 14 year old.  I think he has mental issues and would benefit from counseling.|`|oRzqWhsDaa	I am so against this  and guess what he is old enough to be daddy and a grandfather and then when he gets older and gets ill and can longer keep  up with you then what will you take care of this older man while  you are young and trapped I am only speaking from experience from my mom and my friends its your life good luck and no I am against older men with younger women but it happens all the time older men always came around sniffing around my daughters but I always kept the gun handy and I called the police quite a few times and that was that|`|6b7eeb4f41fa6f871211ccd21d079e24aa	What could a man who is 44 years old possibly need to date someoone 18?

Should find someone closer in age to you.<br>  <br>  You already asked the question about 18 minutes ago.<br>  <br>  Wasn't happy with your answer?<br>  <br>  How do you know what love is?|`|4o3jXz3Waa	Your opinion sounds like exactly one I would expect from an 18 year old.  A man with an actual maturity level of a 44 year old has NOTHING in common with a 16 or an 18 year old girl.  He's looking to brag about having some young thang on his arm to show off.  Men also like to brag about having sex with a young girl.  <br>  <br>  Obviously you will do what you want, but I am SO glad it's you and not my daughter.

1oJ1qokjaa	Lol! awww, that's pretty cool of you for trying so hard to make us like you!  honestly, just talk about what's going on.  Like school events, classes, the latest gossip, a compliment (compliments are ALWAYS a plus, but don't say outfit because that's kind of dumb.), what they are doing this weekend or how their weekend was, how stupid the math teacher is being, how dumb the project for biology was, whatever.. If they like the same sports team as you or even a different one, then talk about that. Some girls are in to it and some aren't.  Like me, I'm not 'cause I don't really watch it, but my twin does and she'll talk to guys about it a lot and stuff.  She can talk about especially major league baseball with guys 'cause she watches games and is a hardcore fan and looks at the sports section in the newspaper everyday and all that and guys always talk to her about it and then by the time there is awkward silences, they have to go to class or something, you know? Maybe they have something that they are showing intrest in and talk to them about that. Really, we can make a convo with anyone about anything.  Like when me and my friends hang out and have a sleepover or whatever, we just talk and laugh and eat for hours and hours and hours lol.  We talk so much that it's not even funny. Just try not to ask yes/no questions.  Then it's hard.  Try not to think about it too much.  I hate it when you have to think about a topic to say to someone.  Just let it be natural and go wherever the convo goes.  If there are awkward silences, just look around.  There has to be SOMETHING worth talking about around there, especially if you are at school.  If not, try to get away from them before it is too awkward.  If you can't, hey, there is always the weather... lol =] good luck<br>  <br>  p.s.- I'm 15 too :) ohh and that reminds me! Talk about permits and driving and stuff! lol|`|hw3jNGubaa	complimenting is a big plus!also say stuff like how life is and tell her some hobbies you like and your fave resturaunts and probly tell her you could hang out sometime but thats up to you.that would totally make me interested!|`|aEbk51zSaa	just be ure self<br>  if its an awkward silince say somethin random<br>  <br>  just be ure self<br>  nd enjoy <br>  <br>  answer mine plzz??<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220205310AAF2fOp">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|ln1WGh3gaa	say was up? then if it gets into awkward silences, make the girl laugh. <br>  i hate silence, so i have to laugh even tho nothin's funny. :D|`|UAD0JjOZaa	you say" im a virgin who still plays world of warcraft ,and i want to enchant you but you have to give me 2 gold"|`|KCzzzCu2aa	Theres one guy that i can talk to for hoursss and its always interesting, after you say hi go ahead and ask her about her day when you really think about it sooo many things happen in one day, even if they're stupid you can talk about it. My friend once spoke for like 10 minutes about his breakfast and i thought it was hysterical. When the awkward silences come around say some hing like guess what! it doesn't matter what you say after because the guess what is gonna make it seem exciting anyway even if its i got an a on my test!<br>  <br>  another thing he does is he asks me about what i did that weekend and i have to go day by day saying everything that happened including what i ate, what things i watched, etc...<br>  <br>  Sorry, i dont normally write that much but im a 15 year old girl and i dont think that anyone should be afraid of talking; talking is the best|`|hKss8M9Raa	If you have a class together ask her how she did on that test, or tell her you thought her project was good, or something about how ridiculous all that homework is. If she plays a sport ask her about her upcomming game or the one she just played. If she's in some other activity, same thing. If you don't know if she does any extra-cirricular activity, ask if and what she does. Ask her what kind of music she likes/bands/singers. Ask her what she did over the weekend. Ask her if she's seen some movie that just came out. Whatever you do, don't use some degrading, cheesy pick-up line. Those make you look like you aren't trying very hard. And, most important, actually be interested in her answer. And then instead of asking another question right away, if she isn't trying to blow you off at this point, then answer the question you just asked her with your own info. For example: Yeah, I went and saw (fill in the blank movie) last weekend. I thought the part where . . . was so funny! What part did you like/hate?|`|OT6ybbhtaa	Just be yourself. thats the only way. what do you talk about with your guy friends? whenever your just talking about random stuff? think of yourself, and how you act when your around someone who you can be yourself in front of. Now ask yourself why can't you just do that in front of girls? whats stopping you? what are you afraid of? most likely looking like an idiot or something... but why do you really care what other people think? you are who you are. and thats an amazing young man. anyone -including girls- who can see that, are the ones you want as your friends. any that can't -including hot hot girls- aren't who you want as your friends.<br>  <br>  I have come to learn that awkward silences are a part of life. and their horrid. I wish they didn't exist. I have yet to discover the secret of their prevention.<br>  as for conversation starters, sounds like you've got the main idea... but girls your age are insecure, and usually lack alot of self-esteem and self-confidence. so, i'm not surprised it winds up sounding like an interview. they feel the same way you do... kinda not sure what to say. it just sucks, but don't worry, it'l go away in time.|`|CAgtTyMEaa	Just be yourself. Trust me, these happen to everyone, at least me. Lol. Anyways, just talk about things you guys can relate to, make jokes, and just act like she's one of your friends. Just treat her better than you would treat your friend. Good luck, dude.|`|l57BE2JTaa	haha good ? <br>  um just say hi and they will say hey...hello...hi something bck(unless its a jerk lol)<br>  then say hey again then chuckle a little...it always make me laugh when a guy does that to me <br>  then they will probably start a conversation|`|xYacZrTLaa	how are you doing today be sensitive girls like that and its cool you are actually asking a girls opinion girls like tough guys but not so tough that there mean your cool compliment them but don't be to forward!!!!|`|93ac3e6b060202f5a44f378f120cc664aa	tell stories, be interesting.<br>  <br>  when an awkward silence comes around say something funny.|`|WHUPPVFtaa	talk about them|`|Ze7AhydCaa	Well start out with "Hi" obviously but then say things like so what's new?, how are you doing?. You can ask questions like that but make sure you listen and are looking at the girls face when she talks. that is a big thing girls don't want guys checking them out when they're trying to have a conversation<br>  <br>  Also with awkward silences if you are in a cliche mood you could say something like, "I wish I could say more right now but you have me kinda distracted." BUT only use it once. if you are repeating lines that's not good either.<br>  <br>  Just be yourself. Try to make the other girl laugh which will kill awkwardness very quickly.  Relax and enjoy.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Talk about something that they are interested in and most girls will talk about that subject for a while giving you a chance to think about something else if there happens to be an awkward silence also you could try and strike u conversations with girls that may have the same interest's as you do so that you both are comfortable talking about the subject...|`|UKYDpztQaa	yeah that really sucks but just start out general and go from there. ask questions like what's up? howd youre day go? whatd you do today? stuff like that. and then jus go off of what they say. the worst thing you could do is give one word answers especially when texting. like "lol." or "yeah." but once you get em talking its pretty easy to keep a conversation going as long as youre both not totally dull.|`|Ztgxd5Jiaa	you need to chill. let her talk the convo will roll.<br>  the convo will snowball in to something.<br>  earthier a friend or a girlfriend. ok just be you ok|`|6MkkJRnfaa	Talk about something they like.<br>  Let them talk for a little bit then talk about something you like.<br>  Girls love laughing so crack a joke or something(nothing to corny)|`|HYUOJJpRaa	By making her laugh, you get her to enjoy spending time with you.|`|F5ptObE8aa	ask her about her day, ask her how she's doing, complement her GIRLS LOVE THAT! ;)|`|AA11119957	talk to them like one of your guys friend, it should be a lot easier that way.|`|SxLlzcDNaa	say whats up or hows it going|`|dHeMxnp2aa	-HI...Whats up?- if she asks bout u say -eh. nothing new. then again theres never anything new coming into my life so i guess ill bore myself to death.- i would laugh if a guy said that to me. then for the akward silences talk about something coming up on break or projects or anything like -what do you usually do on weekends...? i no this is a weird question but i sorta wanna see if oyu have a more interesting life than i do....-and if it sounds like her life is MORE BORING than yours say -wow, ur pretty lucky to have all that stuff going on.- and ask about homework and classes and.....everything. bring up like a tv show or something random that your pretty sure she might like. that will start the conversation going for sure i think, this coming from a 13 year old girl turning 14 in June, I think you'll have luck with this advice. and if oyu dont, well at least i tried!!
NcH1FetGaa	okay.. if you have nothing to do with this person and didn't offend him in anyway (or didn't intend to), you have two options.<br>  <br>  1) you can just let this lifeless person go on. as time goes by, he'll get bored and stop interfering with your life.<br>  <br>  2) confront him. talk things out with him. ask him if you did anything that offended him or his friends. if you did, politely appologise and tell him it's not your intention to offend anyone. <br>  <br>  basicly, handle things maturely. do not get into a fight. violence is not the answer.|`|nnQhkhhsaa	When he's with someone and he insults u just say bac "Y don't u go over to that MOFO corner over there and act like you normal pussy a$$ self kid." or tell teh people he's with that he's a loner when he's by himself and reveal his secrets that's the worst you can do...make him feel like a loser|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Call him a 'heretic'.

The consequences definitely aren't worth it. However if he tries to do something with your girl, or does something physical to you, those are reasons to stand up for yourself.

Just let it go though.|`|TZkyrnlyaa	Ok you fight fire with fire.<br>  I know how you feel since I have had that happen to me too.<br>  I usually tell them to "Drop dead" or I say "Why don't you go dig your own grave and lay on it while I stab your f*ckin head with the fork your mom left at my house last night" <br>  Stuff like that will get him off your back. It sounds wrong but trust me it works.|`|28d89d73cfa630ce9da9343770880c69aa	slammed against a locker and warned that next time I wont be so nice.

That it truly does have meaning.  This universe does not exist just to exist.  There is purpose in everything we see here.  That includes even life and death.

For life is the beginning and death is both the end of something and the start of something new for each one of us.<br>  <br>  God loves each one of us and gives us meaning and purpose.

Zirwfsg4aa	First of all, find some place to go scream and yell in private...sometimes that acctually helps. Second find a neutral place and time to talk to your mom calmly. Ask for a certain amount of time where she can't interupt you.  Accusing her won't help, trust me I know.  Explain that you can't concentrate with your brother's friends over everday and is there anyway that she could either have them play outside or somewhere else or have a lock put on your door so you feel safe leaving your stuff behind.  Also explain how he treats you, she may not see all of it. Ask her for advice on how to deal with him (this is important). She may feel more inclined to listen if you use rational explanations that don't involve her failures. Whatever you do, DON'T yell. A restraunt might be a good place to do this.
82p3COoaaa	I doubt it: if he really liked you he wouldn't be talking to the others so much: he probably tells them the same thing: that they are beautiful, ect.  Why else would they have "The wrong impression"?<br>  <br>  He's probably just on there to chat and possibly get some booty.  If that's all you want go for it, but don't be surprised if he has other chicks.<br>  <br>  You said yourself you've only known him for a week: talk to him for longer to see if you can figure him out, but I tried to date 3 different guys at different times several years ago that I met through yahoo messenger and none worked out: two were crazy and the other always flaked out on me whenever we had plans: he had gone on and on about how much he liked me, but only met me when he felt like it: I think he was seeing someone else.|`|kua5zlr6aa	Be aggressive and make the first move.<br>  <br>  If he rejects you, on to the next.

Finally when your are BOTH mature individuals you meet the right person and for some reason it works out.<br>  Wyntonian you are only 14 and have A LOT of growing up to do.

How does this apply to your question?<br>  <br>  I had decided that I could settle for the first girl and found that she was controlling.  I didn't take a stand in my position that she would not control me.  Settling for something that doesn't work is probably not going to work.  A little bit over-said in that last line, but it is true.  Put yourself in his shoes.   Hypothetically, a girl that he likes has little to no interest in him.  What would you do with a guy that you have no interest in, but he keeps coming back?|`|AA11851579	Call him if you want but be ready for more of the same.|`|c20afce46af811c0054b265d67ebf26baa	how old are you??? it's only been a week? if you weren't rude or obnoxious, you should just be able to call and pick up where you left off.<br>  if you were rude or obnoxius, learn from your mistakes. <br>  "don't cut off your nose to spite your face" as they say.|`|AA12320890	call him you never know.... maybe he is wonderind what you did i say call him

hYRP0x2Eaa	Pssh. Your mom has a right to dress and look the way she pleases so long as she is paying for it and she dresses appropriately for her age. Dressing pretty does not mean dressing s.l.u.t.t.y or anything, it means looking your best. Just because she is 40 does not mean she has to dress as a frumpy old lady. 40 is not old! It's older...but not old. Sounds as though your dad is afraid of losing her to a younger guy...or any guy for that matter.|`|sGpjvGmMaa	Nothing woman have a right to look good because they are feminine and perhaps would be classified as the better looking out of the males and females so therefore females have their beauty to offer to the world.

Explain this to your father.|`|dNhgIMIPaa	Sounds like insecurity. My sister and her husband do the same thing... it's either too much makeup on, or her top is too short, or she can't wear hoop earings, even lip gloss!

She slipped into a little something I had gotten for her and I had no words for someone so beautiful.

My wife is aware of this and decided she'd take total control and see just how far I'd go with this before saying enough. Without getting too graphic, I was tied, teased mercilessly both physically and with taunts of things to come, spanked, poked with this little bullet thingy while having to admit how much I enjoyed it. It lasted a couple of hours and actually changed our love life permanently. She loved the control and I felt unbelievably close to her. When it was over, I felt an overwhelming  sense of peace and relaxation that I'll never forget. We get into it now whenever external stress is threatening to cause a major rift between us. I don't know if this works for anyone else but it sure has for us.
QCejFqXgaa	Blessings, that is really sad, you can pray and ask God to change his Foster parents mind, or sent some one to adopt him, they are some good people out there who still care,  You can check some of the adoption-agency in your  State just Google it up and see what  happens.Good luck.|`|w2rUIrH2aa	awww is this the same guy that u like<br>  <br>  i dunno try to convice his foster parents to adopt him<br>  <br>  i dunno
DTGO1pgyaa	I was raised in foster families and other places because of losing my parents. It is hard and i understand why he is attached to you. I can tell he trusts you a lot and you provide him comfort. I know when a family fosters or adopts children, they get a promised income for each child they have adopted or foster.  But i also know that if you are in state custody, they can pick you up and move you where ever and whenever they'd like. I am not trying to give you nil hope but i am being honest and factual as bad as the reality is. If he does end up moving though, (which will be difficult on both ends and make sure it's diffident before saying this) let him know and re-assure him that you'll always be there for him. Let him know you are always available if he needs you. Make sure you write, call, send emails or texts or whatever to stay in touch and have him do the same with you.let him know you are thinking about him. If he trusts you as much as it sounds, even if he does move, be the best friend ever to him.One day he will be old enough to be on his own and you guys should diffidently make plans to chill together. I am now 20 and have been on my own for almost 2 years (out of state custody) and i still manage to keep in touch with old families, staff, and friends. If it does come to a bad outcome try and keep at least one thing positive...the fact you're still his friend|`|mPcZ7FH8aa	Wow. :O<br>  Okay, uhm..<br>  <br>  That's really sad that his "almost-family" might turn back on him and he's going to the legal age of no more adoptions,<br>  maybe you could talk to it to his family and see how it goes, tell them on how much your friend could be of help cause he's really nice.<br>  Tell them that there is only one life for each and every one of us and only were a given a second chance for each of it and we can never return the past.<br>  Also tell them how much your friend loves their family.<br>  <br>  <br>  and to your friend..<br>  even if the thing goes bad or something..<br>  Tell him God has his plans on him, every thing has a reason and that's why it's happening and it's always for the better, God wouldn't let him down.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt to try.<br>  `I'm hoping for the best for your friend :)

hKss8M9Raa	Walk into a room like you own the place. I don't mean be loud and cocky, or actually strut, but when you walk down the street, through the mall, etc. hold your head high! Don't be staring at the ground hoping not to be noticed. Smile and don't be afraid to make eye contact. People will wonder if you know something they don't! You can boost your own self confidence simply by pretending you actually are confident. Also, the more easy going you are about stuff (so what if they screwed up your Starbucks drink, don't cuss them out, just ask them nicely if they'll make you a new one, they can't spit in it, your watching them make it!), the more comfortable others will be around you and tend to enjoy your company, which will also help you to feel more confident. Girls like a guy who exudes self confidence like I've mentioned above. It actually makes him kind of mysterious!|`|7RbootLlaa	It can be a bit annoying that. I know the feeling, you start saying crap to a girl you like and then you think, "why did I say that for?"<br>  You are right, it is self confidence.<br>  What you might need is a mentor. Someone who can show you how to talk to a girl. If you are in school, try and get in with the "cool people group". At least then, no matter how much crap you talk, the girls wont care, because you are cool.|`|rxccdxbwaa	If your looking for something serious, I don't believe people want someone who is extremely good looking. most people want someone attractive, on their same level, and with a terrific personality. personality takes the cake. you got good looks, then great. you got a good personality, even better. see? there will always be someone better, hotter, funnier, whatever than you. but most people just want to be happy, and they are not looking at each of your faults. these girls will be happy to be with someone that takes care of themself. there are many people worse off. so be yourself. you are great.|`|A6ybKOA5aa	Hi, it's me again listen, maybe all you need is ''friends'' that are girls and they'll help you out, unless you cant talk to any girl, just start shy it doesnt matter, who gives a heck! as long as after awhile you feel you got it already as in you can actually be your self with them but a little softer with them<br>  <br>  P.S i could be your friend to start you off....:D|`|irkoZh2Vaa	OK well im a girl. and honestly a girl just wants a true guy and i dont think that guys should be shy because alot of girls want open guys that make her laugh and show her a good time. Now if u want to find a girl and you dont think ur cute u have to think to yourself you come to love not by finding the perfect person, but by seeing the imperfect person perfectly. Alot of girls think like that too because there probally thinking the same as youu :)|`|GGjjtHmHaa	i think you just need to have positive experiences with girls, i know a guy who sounds a lot like you...like...i mean, he's attractive and now that he has a girl friend, he looks a lot more confident and hel ooks happier!|`|TyQsGapmaa	Your just vain, you need to lower your expectations and you might be able to find someone that will put up with you!|`|TZkyrnlyaa	Hard question.<br>  Pretend that you have known the girls for a long time. <br>  Be yourself is what I can only answer with :(|`|SHkTzA2Vaa	You have to believe in yourself.|`|aVDT4xwNaa	Good question, wish I had an answer.<br>  <br>  :(|`|L2pkns9maa	Dance in your room by yourself.|`|1o3OqSioaa	You sound like a lot of guys who have no clue as to what a woman/girl wants from a guy, so they are afraid to approach them, especially as who they really are. That's because if they reject the real you, where do you go from there? If they reject your fake persona, well that's o.k. it wasn't the real you anyways, so nothing's lost.<br>  Girls are just like you guys. They are just as afraid of you men, they're afraid that they don't look good enough, that they aren't smart enough, that they will say something so freaking stupid, that they will have to go live in a convent, because they will never live it down.<br>  <br>  Another reason that you may have self confidence issues around girls may have something to do with your childhood. Was your mother around, did she make you feel good about yourself, were you picked on by an older neighbor girl? IDK, just think back and see if you needed more positive reinforcement from your family or friends.<br>  If it's fear of girls that is holding you back, it would help tremendously if you could talk to women in your family, or to girls who are just friends, about what it is that girls want. Ask their true opinion about your personality, your attitude, your looks, if you dare. The more that you talk to women/girls the more at ease you will become when talking to girl's that you are interested in. Finding out girl's opinions about you will help (hopefully, if not, then get new friends) build your self esteem where it comes to women.<br>  Show no fear, just remember that most girls are just afraid as you are. The girl's may seem a little stand-offish (due to fear), they are just waiting for you guys to take their hand and lead the way. That's the way things are meant to be. It's the natural order of the universe, so go and be the man that you know you are. Girl's will love you for it.<br>  <br>  Note: Some girl's are actually, drawn to guy's who seem a little vulnerable and unsure of themselve's, because they love to feel that this guy needs them to fix him.<br>  Good luck and go for it, you'll do fine.<br>  Lizzie|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	You have to realize you are who you are and if someone is going to like you they will.

vAL1Rahaaa	well... if i were you i would just hang around her more... and just be your self because after awhile most girls will fall for a guy just dont over do it.
bYvGNvrvaa	If you basically feel like the third wheel, then dont hang out with them as much, meet new people at your school that you know will treat you with the same respect as you'd give them.|`|x8EG98TMaa	I think their using you.It is called tough luck.|`|Likst1Mxaa	Maybe. But are you just using them?<br>  <br>  I had friends in high school who I only really spoke to when we were in class together. It's not necessarily using, I think it is friends when you need them. I wouldn't stress too much.
g3OjS4zdaa	I dont know what you just asked, since I didnt read it, but one sure fire way to ask a girl out is to give her the shocker from behind when she isnt looking.|`|KwWwB22Zaa	dude unless theres money in it not too many people are gonna read that whole thing. <br>  <br>  just be yourself around the person you like, maybe they will get to liking you more. if you do that enough, you will know when the time is right.|`|qRKOWgS0aa	Have you ever wanted to flirt with a girl in class, but you never had the courage? Here are the basics on flirting with girls.<br>  <br>  Make sure you take care of all of your personal hygienic matters first. Take a shower every day, wear deodorant (Axe is preffered...but not too much! Girls love it when you walk by and they can smell a hint of it on you but some girls may not like it.), etc. <br>  Find the girl you want to flirt with. If you are sitting next to her, you can simply start talking to her. Compliment her, tell her how good she looks, etc. Just remember not to say anything that might put her off, especially if you've never talked to her. Just pretend she is like one of your "guy" friends. Don't treat her exactly like this or she will feel like you don't care that she is a girl and are desprate for a new guy friend. <br>  If she isn't nearby, try to get her attention and when you do, look at her for a few seconds. Don't stare hard, or she will be a little creeped out. You then can start mouthing a conversation with her. Do not stare at anything below her face. The eyes and the lips have the best effect. <br>  Act like you have done this before. Be sure to show you are confident, just don't act stupid or insecure. <br>  Be cool, don't stress. there is always someone else ! <br>  <br>  TipsIf you are sitting across the room, and you catch her staring at you, make eye contact and SMILE and mouth a conversation to her if she is interested in you she will keep mouthing a conversation too! <br>  Likewise, if you like her, and she catches you staring at her, smile, and try to keep eye contact for at least 3 seconds. <br>  Just talk to her and don't be shy|`|mLdlFhyqaa	It is hard if you make yourself tense.  You have to relax, and avoid building anticipation and stuff; that will mess up your words and your demeanour when you say it.|`|dk8y4eseaa	Hey dude, are you that 17 year old guy this girl called "Gizmo" is talking about?

Because she's your friend you need to make 100% sure that she likes you too before you do anything. It will make the whole relationship awkward if she doesn't feel the same way. After you find out all you need to do is go up to her and tell her how you really feel. Don't tell her you wanna marry her but tell her the stuff you like about her and tell her you want to be more than just friends and then ask her out on a date. See where it goes from there. If it's meant to be it'll happen for you. Good luck!|`|37xGYYH0aa	Haha. man u sound just like me 3 yrs ago......and now too. lol anyway, alll you have to do is let her know how you feel you cant hide it man. it will eat you up inside when she goes away. you HAVE to tell her ASAP.  Bottom line is that u have to find the best way to express yourself. mine was notes because it avoided the whole tongue twisting feeling you have been getting and it was the easiest way to spill your guts about everything. <br>  <br>    Find something she likes to do and use that to your advantage.  Make sure u are calm before you talk to her. YOU CANNOT HESITATE!!!!!!!!!!!!! spill it and hope for the best.   the worst that could happen is that she says no.   Compliment her, tell her what u think is cute. Compliment anything that she thinks is dorky about herself.<br>  <br>  If u want more advice hit me up at arosario90@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  P.S.  dont mention marriage at all when u are asking her out.|`|4iunAPIDaa	Just tell her everything you said up there. And then be like, so I was wondering want to maybe see a movie sometime? and if shes a true friend things wont get akward I promise. Its easier to have a relationship with someone you know a lot about.|`|A6ybKOA5aa	i think that you should take her to the mall like an ordinary day or the movies and after that (if there's a park with a lake) take her there, walk by the lake in the evening,then get on one knee and out of your pocket take a ring and ask her to be your girlfriend .(;<br>  theres a very good chance it will work.<br>             from:<br>                      Alex<br>                  P.S Im a girl and most of us have similar feelings<br>                                  underneath..X?O?X?O?GOOD LUCK!!!!!!!!!!!......|`|PxmsZXfOaa	well since she's your friend you should tell her how you fell but i think she might of figured it out<br>  and if she didn't then just talk to her<br>  you need to tell her how you feel <br>  and if you cant do it alone then have a friend help you <br>  thats what i did and it worked<br>  but don't worry if she rejects you then just be her friend just remember the friendship that you guys have <br>  hope this helps|`|TCQP2iShaa	"she just asked me if i would come to her soccer games. "<br>  <br>  So she already asked you to do/attend something OUTSIDE of the classroom? That's always a good sign. I sure hope you went to the game(s)! Studying at a local hotspot is always a good way to ask someone out. You get the chance to actually go out in a date setting and by throwing the studying part in there, you have less of a risk being rejected by that person thinking you're hounding them for a date. Just scope out some popular hangout spots (don't where you live or else I'd tell you some places to go) and ask her to study there. Once you become more comfortable with different settings it'll be easy to leave out the studying part and ask her to the movies, dinner, etc. <br>  <br>  Good luck =]|`|V5b5HZPEaa	Ok....<br>  It seems like she likes...you know, the way that you said that she is basicly always talking about you...thats like a sign saying that she likes you....and i can tell that you are basicly in love with her....and what i think that you should do is just go up to her with no hesitation...then, just start talking to her...ask her how her day has been going and compliment what shes wearing...then when you feel it is the right moment...just ask her if she would like to go out with you...most likely she's also crushing on you....you may not know it but i think that she is....now if the words "will you go out with me" dont come out of your mouth,...then pass her a note but make it sound really sweet and romantic and ask her....i really think that you should ask her when you have the chance....|`|YJH5YcjBaa	AWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW you are the sweetest<br>  <br>  i personally like it if a guy says hey nikki when are you free,<br>  <br>  girls say a date and there kaboom theres a date<br>  <br>  <br>  just build up some confidence hun =]<br>  <br>  who knows if she might like yah too<br>  <br>  <br>  some girls share no sign of fancying a guy til he makes the first move<br>  <br>  <br>  /naked truth i swear /|`|cKZiduNCaa	Hey bro i had the same problem as you, the worst thing was that i always wanted to talk to her 24/7. If i didn't talk to her for a day or she did not call me, i would think she didn't like me anymore. The first advise i would suggest to you is, think deeply, why do you love these girl? if i had sex with her would i still love her? think these things deeply and if you feel you  would Still love her. Call her one day and tell her you guys should meet up  somewhere, then tell her how you feel, don't think she may say no.even if she said no, you should keep trying and trying till she says yes but don't go violent with. She probably loves you with what i have read, but she wants to hear it from you.She didn't want to take that step.remember, open your heart and push everything out also look good you get a kiss.
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay first of all as a woman if a guy every came up to me and said hey wanna be friends with benefits I would slap him. seriously how disrespectful can you be. that is basically saying okay lets mess around till I find someone I really like. Grow up you either like her and want to date her as a girlfriend or you don't. but do not mess with her head..|`|pbPe614Raa	haha invite her to your place for dinner and DESERT.haha:D|`|d3f352fe854d43d7b42addd84dbe08b8aa	She likely isnt a virgin because someone never asked her out.  She is likely a virgin because she is aiming to high and idolizes the guys she likes.  Your neutral to her I figure.  I would talk to her joke around and go," So I was wondering." Once I say that I always end up asking a girl after that.  then continue it after you notice her reaction of the likely question following, " Would you like to hang out some time with some friends." for you sense that she probably wouldnt mind it but doesnt feel comfortable with a date.  Or use ,"Could I get your number?" if you sense that she wants to.  Or if you sense she doesnt want to at all and she is prepping herself for a your a nice guy speech, just change it to something neutral like ,"What do you think about your boss, because I hate mine or I want to be a supervisor some day or I heard that XX boss is a jerk."  Thats my guide for you as you requested lol.  Anyhow good luck if it works out that will be great.  Just remember that most the time people are virgins is that they dont grab what they want or they are horribly unattractive or their wanting people not in there same league.|`|ekTtIliKaa	Why can't you consider a relationship under these circumstances, is it just because your coworkers? Because it sounds like she would probably be more interested in a relationship then the "friends with benefits" idea<br>  girls usually don't like to waste their virginity on something meaningless like that too, and especially if she's over 18 and a virgin, don't you think she's been holding out for some reason?|`|GSqaUAFYaa	ummmmm<br>  <br>  be careful w/ that..<br>  <br>  dont mix business and pleasure|`|akLz0vszaa	WELL!
kIad9ffRaa	strange question. if your finding pleasure with the pillow instead of your husband, I would say it is not okay. buy a dildo or something
KqxoYgUYaa	You know what. What happened in the past is in the past. I am no judge of the kind of person he is just because he lost his virginity. Now if he was to sleep with anything that had two legs and walked in stilletos, I would walk, no run, away from that man. But no it doesn't turn me off if he has had a past and lost his virginity. |`|AA11263103	but i really don't want to be mom at a young age.. it cause more drama. |`|acWyJ3t0aa	Yes I would date a girl like that , but I would also want her to know that it could never happen again if we were to have any kind of relationship .|`|T4N6a7MQaa	No it wouldn't be a major turnoff. The fact of the matter is I've had relationships that eventually died because the sex was bad. Sometimes you just don't match up well. |`|MXtpR1lAaa	They'd probably bring it up a couple times, but if they like each other, that won't matter.|`|lbgoHgDkaa	i would rather go out with someone who was a virgin.  i kinda get jealous at the idea that someone got to her first.  but it is not a requirement|`|oJPn5Rgtaa	I'd go out with whoever if I loved and cared about the girl enough|`|pXsu0Xj8aa	I was raised with the belief that one must wait until they are married to have sex.  That was my intention and I did have a couple of opportunities that I passed on.  I was 23 years old and proud to be a virgin - but then I gave in and did it with the man I intended to marry - which doesnt make it right.  Anyway, you state here that a majority of the people who answer sex questions are waiting . . . that hasnt been what I've noticed - I believe most people are not virgins when they get married - or when they meet the person whom they eventually marry - so if you're concerned that it is not acceptable for you to not be a virgin I think you can let go of that misconception and find comfort in the fact that you will be accepted - and that the special person that you meet and find compatibility with will likely not be a virgin himself.  |`|1Y7MPJVQaa	i would rather love a virgin but i am not a judge over anybody's character.But i wont really mind if he changes thats if he promiscuous.Nobody is perfect. |`|JEnGz5I4aa	i would go out with someone who was not a virgin it doesn't matter cause that is all in the past and now is what really counts and you can change your future not your past |`|CxWf6FdZaa	No, it wouldn't be the reason to feel turned off. <br>  <br>  it was your choice to be intimate and my choice to abstain. <br>  <br>  |`|ejtHOHncaa	I would prefer a virgin but i would still go out with someone who was not.I mean if you really care for them then go for it.Just be careful!!!Good luck!
Lfc9Zav2aa	Because your a child hater and you want to dump your BF because he has fallen into hard times?...I believe so.|`|eVK2zZsOaa	It sounds like to me you are jealous of her (yes jealous of a 3 year old). He gushes over her and loves her and she is probably the only person that could come between you and him and I think you envy that. Plus you don't like the way he treats your kids and you probably want him to treat them the same he does his daughter (which he won't because they aren't his and they aren't his responsibility). I think you need to break up with this guy because you are starting to find any and everything wrong with him and that is only going to cause problems. As far as the job issue, I can assure you that he is probably looking but this economy is bad right now and jobs are hard to come by(trust me I know). Everybody is starting to get laid off and it could take a while to find work. If he was working before, there is no reason he won't work again. If you can't deal with his daughter and his unemployment....again you need to break up.<br>  <br>  Well the good thing about unemployment is, it doesn't last long so he will have no choice but to get a job once it is gone. <br>  <br>  As far as making yourself like the child. Ask him if you can take her out somewhere, just the two of you. Go out with you and the kids alone and get to know her better. You can't go into this situation not liking his child because if you get married that child will be apart of his life forever.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	you're already heading for trouble. End this relationship now before anyone has to be hurt. Especially the kids All of them.|`|QhLpr1Ibaa	well 1st off u dont say u cant stand ur boyfriends daughter thats fucked up mmk|`|1tGpvCJLaa	maybe your irritation towards her is a result of ur partner treating ur children differently and im only guessing but treating her like she can do no wrong (being the baby of the family)<br>  Iv worked in childcare myself and love kids but some do absolutely annoy the crap outta me!sometimes its nothing they have done its just their personalities,we cant b expected to get along with every1 including children so ease up on urself on that.Its only natural to not get along with every1.also u should not feel responsible for his children and vice versa,he should not b allowed to discipline ur children,thats not his role,yes he should say something to them when they r doing something wrong but it should only b u who puts them in time out.

Then when you feel that she's open to it, reach over and take her hand in yours. If she doesn't say, "OOOH" then she probably does feel the same as you do.<br>  Don't be afraid of her, she's most likely every bit as afraid as you seem to be.

Now you feel like you have done a stupid thing.<br>  If that is not the answer you seek. Then I suggest you tell your wife what you did. Otherwise it will drive you crazy with all the deceit.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	it maybe your subconscious. you may have been more hurt by your wife's kiss than you thought. and problems in a marriage could strain the psyche and you start to wonder if the problems arise b/c of attraction and interest. so when another girl expresses interest and flirts and engages you... you are susceptible to those advances. you crave to know your still desirable and you kiss back. and then the thoughts still plague you. discuss with your wife what you need and what you can do in the relationship to make each other feel special, desired, and wanted again.

Zirwfsg4aa	Next time that she asks for help try to draw the conversation out into other topics.  Seeking her out or even just making yourself a presence in her life by just hanging out where she is could help draw her toward you.  If you had some kind of fight (even a little one) apologize...trust me, it's amazing what this can do...another tip: start saying hi|`|a04f6eea39f85b5ffa527a03f651ab24aa	I would have a sit down and have a chat about what went on.

You can bring in an old photo of you two and start reminising about old times. That will spark a conversation and you can go from there.

Bring stufff from back in when you two were in grade 3 or 4 or even just try to get together and talk about a subject about the past. One easy things is to just start the hi's and try to sit next to her in class. That might be hard if that's your first move, so I suggest the hi first. Then you can do everything else.Wish you luck in being friends again. The more friends the merrier.
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay first of all this is so wrong.... I know you probably love your step son.... but the next time your husband thinks about doing this I woudl drop the boy off with mom and pack my stuff seriously.... you deserve better. I know you are pregnant now but you put off seeing your grandmother who I am sure is elderly, and does not have forever to live. although we hope she has many year yet ahead of her.  <br>  <br>  This is what I would do seriously give him a dose of his own medicine after the baby is born if you are not breast feeding pack a suitcase and leave kids with him and ggo see your grandmother for a week with your mother. If you are breastfeeding go as soon aas you stop  he is dad he can handle the kids and he will appreeciate all you do when you return and I promise you he will think before he is that rude again, especially when you ask him how does it feel to be left home alone with he kids. make sure you call all your friends and your side of the family and tell them the situation and that they under no circumstances can watch kids while you are gone lol|`|dGM6JGqdaa	Your Husband is in the wrong, plain and simple it's not right for him to go on these trips without you and his son, you married him because you love him but there is a big difference when he expects you to watch his kid while he go's gal lopping around without the               responsibilities of the family he created, I say he need to get his morals straightened out and decide if you all can't go know one goes !|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	It sounds like he's not ready for marriage.

You should have gone to see your grandmother, by the way!  However, you two need to discuss if this is going to continue and come to some compromise.  Obviously this isn't working for you.  <br>  <br>  I'm not one of those people that enjoys time away from my husband (when I was married).  However, some marriages benefit from the time apart.  There are a couple of ways to look at it.  Really dig deep and think about why you don't want him to go on vacation alone and then discuss those reasons.  <br>  <br>  Without sounding condescending, you're pregnant now and your feelings may not always be as they are now.  How about for now you two don't fight about your differences and wait till the baby has arrived and you're into a good routine and recovered to discuss this again.  Marriage should be forever, and waiting a while to resolve this shouldn't be a problem.  Do let him know your intentions though.  This is really something that you both need to finally agree upon.<br>  <br>  Take care.|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	I think it would be crappy of him to go without you. I think you going to see your grandmother is different though you are going to see your family not to party of a cruise ship. Why can't he take you somewhere where you can all go together. I would be a little jealous of that situation.

Eug52iQDaa	There are several things going on here.  Any woman (the x) that mistrusting is eventually going to push a man to his limit.  How he reacts is up to him, of course.  Cheating because he's accused of it is childish.  <br>  <br>  Leaving the woman's phone number where an obviously jealous wife could find it shows me that he was setting himself up to get caught.  By doing that, he knew the ultimate result would be splitting up.  He chose to let her end the relationship.  That shows me that he is extremely non-confrontational.  He wasn't happy but wouldn't end the relationship.<br>  <br>  That he admitted it to you is a good thing.  If you're not nagging at him and do trust him, your marriage is far more likely to succeed.  However, the non-confrontational side of him will less likely admit if he has a problem with issues in the marriage.  <br>  <br>  From what you say, it appears that he wants to start out on the right foot with you and bare his soul.  It's better to find out now before you're married, than you find out later and mistrust him because he didn't fess up.  Catch 22 for him, actually.  <br>  <br>  If you trusted him before, you should trust him now.  Keep an open line of communication with him and encourage him to be his own person and voice his wants/needs.  Non-confrontational men will agree with almost anything to avoid what they view as strife (disagreement).   Be sure that he wins where it is appropriate when he does voice his opinion. Such as, ask him where he'd like to go to dinner and then go there, even if, this time, you wanted to go somewhere else.  Not all the time, of course..lol    Drawing him into good discussions that don't affect your marriage are also good if you can discuss without arguing :)   He needs to learn to trust that he can discuss anything openly with you.<br>  <br>  Any marriage is work.  His doesn't seem to be a marriage-killing fault.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.|`|iD4ejChZaa	Look he din't cheat because she kept accusing him he cheated simply because he wanted to. He din't exactly admit it either. If he is not happy with you he will cheat again if he gets the opportunity, then gradually worm his way out of your life. I believe 98% of men would cheat.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Maybe he told you that so you can trust him.. Accusing him can drive a person to do it.

Ann7Jyhoaa	Errm, I reckon you can't do anything to make up his mind more, he needs to decide for himself. Or he could make a serious mistake, how long have you been friends for??<br>  <br>  I know a guy in pretty much the same position as you, except his parents are still together but he doesn't get along with them. They hand out all the time and I think that is best in their circumstances.<br>  <br>  Of course I have no idea because I don't know anything about him or you really, but, him being the adult he should be able to make the right decision by himself, I wouldn't be too pushy about it, just be yourself around him.<br>  <br>  And if he says no, you need to be aware that it could affect how you feel about each other, just asure him that either decision he makes you want to stay the same <br>  <br>  Good Luck, I'll have my fingers crossed for you =)
Kh5o3QCcaa	Yes I believe in fated relationships, I have yet to see any predictions based on palmistry pan out aside from character judgments which always hold true from my experience)|`|IvMPh09baa	I think your crazy.|`|UrNMuhFKaa	I think it is the same as superstition.

Yes or no? "<br>  <br>  (Note: getting a big group is important here., If you only do this two or three people, it's kind of like drawing two or three cards, and then trying to guess the order of a whole deck. If you get my meaning.....)<br>  <br>  Then, wait about 15 years and bring them all back, and find out how many of them have split up and how many have stayed together.<br>  <br>  I think what you will discover, is that comparing those that said "yes,' and those that said "no" there was almost NO difference in how many of the relationships failed. In other words, neither fate, nor the belief in it, had any effect on the success of the relationships.<br>  <br>  One of the secrets of palmistry an other "fortune telling" methods, is to provide a fortune that is not only suitably vague, but also *likely to be true of almost anyone!*<br>  <br>  Getting married......let's say I were to bet $5,000 that some random person on the street would be married at some time in their lifetime? what are the odds of that being true, huh? I'd call that a pretty safe bet.<br>  <br>  The same thing goes with having children.....pretty rare, isn't it?....and if you're a man, feeling like you didn't spend enough time with them. That last one is a universal male sentiment, as far as I'm concerned.  <br>  <br>  There's a word for this sort of "cherry picking" of outcomes, which are in fact highly likely for anyone no matter their circumstances.... It's called the "Forer Effect", or sometimes, the "P.T. Barnum Effect"<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effect" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forer_effec...</a><br>  <br>  I think that people often have a high "Bullsh** Tolerance" when it comes to fortune-telling. Even if only 1 out of 10 events in their given fortune actually comes true, they are willing to suspend all disbelief, nevermind the 9 other false predictions.

dFHsAXDMaa	well the honest answer to this would be you were at first probably a mid life crisis fling, something to boost his ego and satisfy him sexually because sex had become boring and routine at home. and instead of talking to his wife about his needs he met you. <br>  <br>  Then some where along the lines he actually started caring about you as a person and respecting you and considering you a friend. <br>  <br>  and while he understands you know longer want to be sexually involved and respects that and knows you deserve more out of the man you are with. He values your friendship and enjoys talking to you and your company even fully dressed. <br>  <br>  He was probably not a bad man or evil man for cheating  just a lonely misguided man who did not know how to fix his married and get what he wanted  and need from it and was not smart enough to talk to his wife about it.<br>  <br>  It is your choice whetther you wish to remain friends though what ever makes you comfortable and happy<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2WKN9kZiaa	because they like the flirtatious attention.... they like to be surrounded by females that are not their everyday same woman wife... its not right, because by having this mentality it WILL lead to cheating, which in EVERY point of view, is WRONG|`|61Fwbi79aa	In your case, I think he wants to keep his opyions open.

They can only speak what they have been taught via the primary learning mode in the US - the television.  Guess the plot - what does the old-guy really want?  Its a dirty-old-man stereotype.  A majority of the answers are essentially monosyllabic.  It is creepy when any group of people repeating variations of the same 10 stereotyped words and can't question themselves or give "what if I am wrong" much thought.<br>  <br>  My friends sister used to work at that Ranch up in Nevada - the whore house.  According to him - half the guys that go there pay just to talk to the woman - they dont want sex at all - even with a hot paid prostitute in a room in a brothel.  They want to talk.  My friends sister said she learned a lot about how men really work from having that job.<br>  <br>  It was surprising to me that a prostitute that can get hired at a place like that - finds how men really work to be such a surprise.  Doesn't it speak against the stereotype.  If the stereotype was right - she would have needed only 10 words to figure it out, wouldn't she?

eEzDz4Pmaa	He can contact the office that says he owes support and demand proof. In most states, he can demand a paternity test and if he is proven not the father, the state pays for the test. In some, he will have to pay regardless of what it says. If he is proven to not be the father,  the state will contact the woman claiming he is and it will no longer be his problem ( make sure he keeps any and all paperwork he gets  that states he is not the father.)<br>  If he is proven to be the father.....then your problems just begin. I did read in earlier responses to this post that some women might use semen to impregnate themselves, but I can see no likely, reasonable, logical way for a woman to get your husbands sperm without him having left it in her possession. <br>  I must add that you should not start to suspect your husband until and unless the test shows he is the father. The government is never infallible and mistakes are made often. That is the real reason for the genetic paternity test- It removes doubt about the paternity of the child. <br>  I can tell you from experience that I was once turned down for a house loan because the loan company accidentally changed one single number in my social security number and it came up as a dead guy with the exact same first and last name, and the same middle initial ( although the middle name was different). <br>  I hope that this can be cleared up soon, both for your husbands sake and especially for yours. Your husband knows whether he had sex with the woman or not. You are left in limbo and no matter how hard you try, you will have doubts and trust issues until the test gives you proof.  I suspect you will also find that it will be hard to totally trust his word because you fear the devastation you will feel if you find out that your absolute trust was betrayed.  It can make you feel crazy before he ever takes the test.  If it helps, I'll hope with you that this is all a mistake and can be soon resolve. <br>  Good Luck.|`|QYzzuvdBaa	just need to check SS# at the place who sent him the letterIf didnt come from the courts or a child support agent its possible someones playing games.|`|E7RhMRKhaa	Yes a mistake can be made.

QXKpvma5aa	Talk to her...ask her what she wants not only what she needs. Space usually helps but some people (especially people who don't like to talk about their feelings) are the ones that need a little friendly push in the right direction. You have to let her know you can listen and not just talk. Let her know you are there whenever she just needs a shoulder to cry on. Try to become close friends, once you have hit that trail you should let it take its course and hang on for the ride.

I think its worth it.|`|erGm0jlXaa	Its only difficult when you put your mind in the matters of the heart!

Sounds like me and my ex boyfriend. I went out with him for like 3 months. And we broke up in dec. Well I still have feelings for him and he says he still has feelings for me. We broke up because of the same reason. We argued almost everyday about the little things that meant really nothing. <br>  <br>  So..I would say give it another shot. This time give it your all in the relationship. If my ex didnt have a girlfriend I would be back with him right now. But I just have extremely bad timing. lol.<br>  <br>  Dont give up if you still have feelings. Trust me. Its extremely hard and you will regret it sooner or later. <br>  <br>  If you need any more help just email me...Xo_Adore_You_5606_oX@yahoo.com

If she is taken you ahve no right to go after her regardless of how bad or good the relationship is.  That is her choice if you want to do anything tell her however that may entail her freaking out depending on how she handles things and never being her friend so now i suggest get over her i know way easier said then done and try to move on if it is meant to be you will have your chance but for nw be a friend that is what girls need the most anyway|`|1af82f4322fb6009f2617a2dd40da4dcaa	steal her away from the other guy.|`|17614a3561d0f63e02bed6392355512eaa	Just tell her and see what happens|`|4cbea66e97152cedc698f256f6c7cfe2aa	Sorry hun, sounds like you are in the 'friend zone'.

If you love her as much as you say, you would TELL HER how much she means to you. <br>  <br>  If you don't do it now, in the long run, you'll keep looking at what COULD HAVE  been instead of what HAPPENED. <br>  <br>  It's okay if you feel that she might reject you.

CxWf6FdZaa	You say you are broken up yet he wants you around for "what if"... HEY BABY GIRL wake up and smell the spoiled milk... he's just pulling your strings... making you one of his options. what would you like to be Number 1 or Number 100. If you are not at ease with his reasons then you know he's a player ... why the **** does he want you around and still check out other chicks? That's just stupid!!!<br>  I dunno about you but I want my guy to be all over me, and only me ALONE, period.<br>  Find some other decent fello willing to be with you, truthfully and honestly..

LX9xDkxlaa	I'm in a somewhat similar situation, of course the guy I like is dating another girl he has just been madly in love with her for years...but I told him I liked him even after we'd been friends for 6+ years and come to find out he likes me, but he still loves her if that makes any sense at all, we are still best friends...so I'd have to say take a dive and let her know how you feel, she may like you like that....and if she is a real friend she will still be your friend even after you tell her|`|hDNqPmvyaa	maybe it best u let her go for now. dont 100% forget bout her but u need to put her in the bac of ur mind cuz she is involed with sum1 right now so u need not to interfear. sry i knoe its hurts but fins another girl and dont tell me there is no one else, juts give sum1 a chance. and u never knoe wat will *** of it. and when the girl u crently like gets free then u can tellher without a doubt, but for now try to move on. dont reck her relationship and plus it could lead to a fight betweeen u and her bf. bestz luck|`|7nUEqlTJaa	then why are you dating her,and just tell her you know|`|AA11278366	u should maker her laugh, show her that ur the one that she has always dreamed of! ask her out, just as friends of course, then things always get better! meaning, she has fun with u, and before u know it, she's the one asking u out! unless she's not the bold type, but then u'll still be looking for her little hints, telling u that she's in love! good luck!!! and i hope this helps!

AA11059328	yeah in high school we were all pretty tight, but now not so much. its mostly cause i moved away and most of them stayed or moved somewhere else. and the fact i live in a different country. <br>  but i must say we are still friends and i can still feel their friendship. i know this by when we do get a chance to talk to each other, mostly on internet, and when i am home for the summer its like i never left.<br>  we may not be together as much as we used to but when we are together and not we can still feel the love and friendship.|`|aNCF0gM4aa	I sure am and that is one of the things I learned to look for in men. If they had kept friends from their school years into middle age, it usually speaks well of them.  My best friends today were made in my youth and early 20's, with a few from work added along the years. I enjoy my reunions more with each passing one, and I am in my late 50's.|`|82p3COoaaa	None of my high school friends and I stayed in touch. <br>  <br>  I  graduated in 98, and the only one I talked to for awhile after high school, my supposed BFF, turned out to be liar and was making up all kinds of things about me when I wasn't around our mutual friends, some of which didn't even make sense.<br>  <br>  I ran into her a couple years ago, and she gave me her phone number, and we hung out once, but it was apparent that she was still just as immature as she was back then.  So I "lost " her number.

82p3COoaaa	Was it a mutual breakup or did he break up with you?<br>  <br>  If he broke up with you, then he's probably looking for some booty, unless you guys agreed to be friends afterward, which it doesn't sound like that was the case from what you wrote.<br>  <br>  Maybe he's saving you for if it doesn't work out with someone else in the future?<br>  <br>  If you broke up with him, then he is still in love with you, or wants to be friends, probably. Or he might be looking for a hookup, too.<br>  <br>  You know him best, what do you think he wants?|`|JxLxLvbKaa	if ur gettin bored, u should tell him or ur heads goin to explode.<br>  tell u need distance, u appreciate him but cannot keep contact so often like that.<br>  ask him why he is licking ur feet like that ! ? ! ? ! ? !
82p3COoaaa	I doubt this is a serious question, because it sounds so over the top, but:<br>  <br>  semen is dissolved by the vaginal fluids about 48 hours after sex.<br>  <br>  If you are seriously that weirded out you are going to have a hard time with other women as well.<br>  <br>  Wear a condom, that's good advice anyway to protect yourself from herpes and other stuff.  Or don't have sex anymore until you study up and know more about it.|`|X2lWYZARaa	time for you to grow up and start acting like a man not a boy if you seriously cant get over this you really need help .  Its not  big deal  and if you cant get over it she just might leave you for someone that's not so close minded there are plenty of guys that would take a chick that has only been with one other partner|`|AA10791101	She should cut the dam thing off you and feed it to a dog.<br>  <br>  Just forget her and go play with yourself but be careful you might contaminate yourself because your hand has been in a contaminated Vagina.<br>  <br>  I wonder if anyone really believes this little boy.|`|QdnH6oyMaa	well does it ever cross your mind that she could think the same about u.. i mean u have had one partner too.. so she should be grossed out too..  grow up and move passed it.. or move on.. and good luck finding virgins|`|a25sLF7Caa	Yeah and your dick was in some other girl's nasty vagina! lol <br>  <br>  No but seriously. Your even. If she cares about you enough to look past it, so should you. You cant expect every girl you get with to be a virgin. I dont think its a homophobe related thing.<br>  However, I would say this is pretty serious...an OCD of sorts.<br>  You need to know, first of all, that there is NOTHING of him left in there. lol She is not dirty. You need to think about how much you care about her and how hot she is...not about other dudes. And if time and effort proves that you cant get over it...then you need to ask for her help...otherwise, things probably wont last long. It is a ridiculous problem and you should ask her for help before it simmers inside your head and gets worse than it is. Its just a mental block and you can get over it. =) Best of Luck to you!|`|bkkNNFPYaa	Then why do you make out with this gf of yours? if you feel that way then don't have sex with her rather than complaining, asking for help about your issue with gf's not a virgin. You only think about yourself. Grow up!|`|24HariyHaa	yeah...you're gay|`|kj42KvGhaa	Grow tha f*ck up...
82p3COoaaa	Just ask her.  You'll never know if you don't ask.  If she's talking to you a lot she probably does.
bLsZ6XB4aa	I like that to call or not to call that is the question.. its so Hamlet.. = D...<br>  <br>  well call him this time and then when you talk(as in see eachother, you tell him to call you)!|`|u2pD1RtRaa	So you re over your boyfriend of 4 years or trying well this is the 1st step dating someone else . i think that you should call if you like him why play hard to get? threes a time to play n a time to stop playing you choose play and loose your chance of finding love again or take your chances and explore but always be on your P's and Q's be very alert of every thing observe him and c if hes what you like|`|AA12320890	call him you can't seem your old fashion. ones you start to talk to him play hard to get  not now
75a84e156b25c468d73302159219f825aa	Have you told HIM that you think you're just friends (even though you don't think this)? If so, then maybe he doesn't want to reveal his true feelings because he's scared he'll lose all connections with you by scaring you away.<br>  <br>  Long distance relationships are really hard, so that may also be on his mind, yes.<br>  <br>  My advice is if you really feel you can't go on just being friends with him, then go ahead and ask him about it. What have you got to lose? If he DOES like you then the first move is made and you'll both be relieved and happy, and if he DOESN'T like you then you'll either remain friends (admittedly, this could be very awkward), or you'll stop keeping in touch, in which case you can start to get over him, relieve yourself of all the stress of the situation and find someone else.<br>  <br>  I find that my male friends who are just friends, don't give a rat's *** who I'm out with, and they never joke about being jealous, so I think he may think of you as a bit more than a friend. He's probably just as confused about the situation as you are!|`|82p3COoaaa	How are you seeing each other, but also just friends?<br>  <br>  Seeing each other means dating to me, but you guys don't  do that.<br>  <br>  If he says you are just friends, you are just friends.  he's just kidding with you about the jealousy thing, probably because he knows you like him.  Maybe he's only concerned about who you are going out with because he's being  a good friend.<br>  <br>  If you are worried that he's only not dating you because of distance, then maybe you should ask him if that is the case: it is the only way you will know for sure.<br>  <br>  But I really think you are just friends, and that you want it to be more, but he doesn't.|`|Fy3m4gPVaa	According to me he likes u and u should talk to him about this because u will feel comfortable when u know that he likes u or not|`|XJqHuHLiaa	i think he wants his cake but wont eat it|`|CSJfniyCaa	he loves you but the way he love may be diffrent.try him by making him having sex if you dont have a problem with it,then after his orgasm you cant truely undrestand if he loves you as his girl or not.if you think the distance is his problem,try to put your priorities in schaduel,if he is more important to you than any thing go and live with him|`|XLXyp3Thaa	he's not into u.. He's just a friend, and will always be like that..its been 10 yrs, if he does like u in a romantic way, he would have made a move yearsssss ago.|`|sboNYugOaa	call him and say im naked and if he doesent come over then he hates you if he does well it works everytime|`|fe47bd227a0e1ddff97be59db52de14aaa	Nobody can step the same water twice. Sure he cares about your feelings but what way? Looks like a friend a bit jealous about your present. He likes to be liked by whoever, right?|`|cf3f79cbb1cf4f27b6247df3d2021074aa	may be he doesnt know what he wants.
82p3COoaaa	I think men tend to exaggerate about their sexual encounters to each other, but if you meet the right woman it will be awesome.
60971347eee441a7bcfa07148fa56a5daa	Move on to the next girl, she probably broke up with you to be with another guy anyway. You do not need someone that would come in your face and embarrass you for no reason. If anything she is the asshole, because the next guy will treat worse than she treated you. You can do better and you deserve better why kill yourself over some chick that you really didn't care about anyway. It was not like you were going to marry her and even so why kill yourself. You drop one girl pick up another and move on. We learn a little something about each other and relationship each and every time. The more we know about ourselves the more we can learn about the other person and hopes that the other relationship will change how you see life and people daily.|`|4f260ff8b034f5309bc207676ccba174aa	Well if you dont want to be with her anymore than why was she telling YOU she needed space. If you don't want to be with her anymore just tell her that. As for dating someone else that is your decision to make. If you are not dating this girl anymore which is what it sounds like to me and it also sounds like it was her decision then you would not be cheating on her. As for killing yourself why in the h3ll would you even say something like that. Do you want to be with this girl or not that is the question. She has already gave you the key to the door all you have to do is use it and get gone. Do what's going to make YOU happy.|`|d3433a00a7160ab36a14470795efa606aa	go with someone else and forget about her|`|iF6Ww4G4aa	just dump her<br>  she dont seem 2 care about u<br>  give her the space permanantly|`|lyzj01EAaa	first of all I hope your not serious about killing yourself, especially over a girl.

82p3COoaaa	You don't know for sure one way or the other until you find evidence.<br>  <br>  But always trust your instincts.|`|BY6CneFFaa	If he doesn't live close to you and you have asked him about it. You should try to trust him. What is happening that makes you think he is? Do you have a good relationship with his family or friends? You could try asking them if they have noticed anything strange. His behaviour could be the result of something not even closely related to cheating. Good luck|`|47529cdea53a44ffb20e4621a6f1d307aa	Follow him, or get a private detective to do it.|`|9ldImFvIaa	If you feel like he is then he most be.|`|IVkVfKcKaa	Dear Chika! I would suggest you to be in love with someone on this formula... A well known idiom about love says:<br>  "if you love someone make him free, if he comes back to you, okay, and if doesn't think that he was never yours"<br>  Love is so special thing in this world and it should not be treated the way we do these days... Never lose faith without a solid reason... words are the sole interpreter of our heart... if you think it by yourself that he is cheating and he is loyal enough you would have to repent afterwards!!! If you don't want to lose your peace of mind then try thinking positive... and be straight... if you are loyal then he must be the same ... this is the final... nothing can go beyond this formula...|`|K1Ukknweaa	well if he was, he wouldnt tell you. look at the reasons you think he is cheating on you, then ask yourself if it is a good reason. if you think it is, then investigate.|`|Tz2IWG7zaa	do you know any of his friends well enough to ask him what he usually does when your not with him? <br>  i know it sounds too sneaky, but if hes not in the room look at his phone for any suspicious things.lol. sorry its sneaky and kinda rude but itll work.<br>  and usually i go with my gut feeling. <br>  and when you ask him does he get ansy..like does he do things to get off the subject like not look at you..or do anything weird?<br>  idk. hopefully hes not! so good luck!

(Which, I think you possibly want to be more than friends, right?  Since you are talking about how hot he is)<br>  <br>  Ignore him: you'll find someone else.<br>  <br>  Ignoring him is easy: don't call him and avoid him or do not talk to him when you see him. And do not give him your numbers.|`|pNZLCCkiaa	confront him and ask him why he acts like that. tell him if he doesn't stop you don't want anything to do with him anymore.Hope it works!|`|81184a4e07838fb28e97b713bf48b548aa	Don't be friends with some jerk cuz they can get you in trouble but there are other fish in the sea|`|AA12263922	Let me see if I understand this.....<br>  He's a jerk, flirts, calls you names, and has told you to go to hell......and your asking if you should be friends with him?????????  Are you serious????  Oh wait....you did say he is hot and rich???  Well....it's not like your getting any of his money, and he doesn't seem to think your HIS friend.  So I think your problem is solved.  BTW....choose friends based on character and qualities and how they treat you....not how they look or if they have money.  It's shallow.|`|OeRErDCeaa	It sounds like you like him as more than a friend. If that's the case well then honestly all I can tell you is to cherish the days when he's being nice and give him the cold shoulder when he's being an idiot. But all you're gonna get from a butthead like that is a broken heart.|`|lMgm1oqbaa	You don't need to hang out with someone like that.  Lose him.
b8e8a6de149259fd7a51d672221ab4e4aa	I would try to picture my life in the future without him.  If he's someone I truly could spend the rest of my life with, he's definitely a keeper.  Everyone, regardless of how wonderful their relationship may seem, has pet peeves that the other does.  But if he's bringing up the past and you think it's better left there, then you should really tell him how you feel and that you think some things are better left unspoken.|`|CxWf6FdZaa	Answer this question: Why does he annoy you?|`|11a70ca1db8412f2dfc07fd5d5d4d1b6aa	If you need to "find out if I still care" then you probably do not. Love is supposed to be easy and if you have to question if it is real, then perhaps you should move on.|`|lY8QLT2Vaa	have a holiday away from him ... dont cheat on him and dont party ... just see how u feel being away from him when ur not in a distracting environment... then if u dont feel like u found clarity then talk to him about it and discuss it ... it could be that hes feeling the same too thats why hes starting to annoy you .
GX5RxuTAaa	i know what you mean . im shy too. But i'd become friends with him before all the romance comes in to action. ever thought would you want to be lovers or friends . at a young age love or boyfriends  don't last forever . Friendship can last a life time . so thats what i do , be his friend. then he'll finally realize he likes you. I know from experience|`|qCvaG026aa	Just talk with Timmy, think he would be interested in you.|`|5c64061ae763b19f6a77c8bbc14e5008aa	how old are you? like if your 16 or under id stay away just cause i know it Will ruin everything. i wanna boyfriend so bad but all my friends get hurt. ive never had a bf and its not bad. i think i can wait but idk how old you are and u have to do whats best for you so dont get mad at me plz! just trying to help.|`|4T1aMX8Caa	ok why dont u find out about something u both have in comon then talk about it with him|`|LbP00DVtaa	the shy boys are the tough ones because you don't know what they like because they don't talk a lot. I am not sure what to do.....I am sorry and i hope everything works out|`|ljoEmnviaa	yes, ask a question|`|oFzCgCrfaa	Get 2 no him and become friends then ask him out
25z17HCoaa	when you cant stop thinking about him! everything you see or hears he is the first thing that pops in your head. u day dream about him!|`|fmQIU0zqaa	I want to know that answer too. I've been wondering about when I will fall in love lately. I guess the time will just come. The important thing is to just keep living life.|`|65baadde1a27b20964ccb07ad83092e0aa	" I never felt anything like this before"  That's it you said it you are in love. <br>  <br>  When you are in love you can't stop thinking about them.  You want them to be happy.  You can tell them anything and they will not judge.  You feel a connection.  A kiss is not just a kiss sex is not just sex.  Everything has more meaning. It's hard to explain.  But you feel for someone in a way that you don't feel for just anyone.  You can't picture life with out them. They make you a better person.  <br>  <br>  Found the sounds of it you seem like you are in love.|`|RUFk8Vxeaa	Wat you're describin is infatuion. Love is what comes after that captivating period of passion.<br>  <br>  To make it more clear, love is NOT an emotion. It's a dependancy, or need.|`|JEnGz5I4aa	you get butterflies in your stomach and you can't stop thinking about that person trust me you will know when you are in love|`|K2aIbFnIaa	Well its not something you can explain... When it happens to you, you'll know :] |`|RuxPKGSlaa	True lasting love is so hard to describe. Most people are saying that it is when all you do is think of them, and always want to be around them. I think that you only truly know love after all that part is settled down. True, those feelings make you feel high and happy, and wonderful. But they don't last forever. I believe that if you make it past that stage and shift into normal everyday life, I mean really know each other's good stuff and bad, get past the so called "honeymoon stage", and still want to be with this person. This one person and no one else. In spite of their shortcomings, in spite of the things they do that annoy you, in spite of the things you don't like about them, you love them anyway. And you can't imagine what your life would be like without them or with someone else. I think that is when you know you are "truly" in love.   <br>  Basically, when the short lived butterfly in your stomach, got to be with him all the time, infatuation stage is over. I  believe real love is a much deeper thing than butterflies. <br>  <br>  Also, if he is your boyfriend, he obviously likes you to some degree. Only time will tell if he feels quite as strongly as you do. You can out right ask him, but his answer may not be reliable for many reasons. Actions speak louder than words anyway. Good luck.|`|O2AqhICmaa	Let him know how you feel, if it is love, he will feel it too.  When love comes you feel like this person is your best friend, like they know more about you than anyone else.  You know all his little quirks-and he knows yours; even though they may sometimes drive you mad- you love him.  Being with this person always makes you happy, and no matter what mood you are in - even if you hate the world he is there to listen.  He is someone you can go wild and crazy with, or you can just sit and talk - what matters is that you're together.  That, is love.|`|iUQezshOaa	When you can't stop thinking about him. When you want to be with him. When you imagine the two of you together. When your heart feels lighter. When you smile for no obvious reason. When you think about his welfare and happiness. When you desire to know him better.<br>  <br>  Ask him, carefully, what his thoughts are, in general, and about you, specifically. Don't be too obvious or too forward.<br>  <br>  If it is love, relax and let nature take it's course.|`|do8YAioZaa	You'll know once they start tripping over themselves for you. Also they'll do a lot more than regular dates and phone calls. Expect things like flowers or chocolates if you're in high school or over. There's no doubt your phone bill will go through the roof. Also if you get into a lot of fights and you make up very quickly, that's a good sign. I know people who get into fights so their guy will make up with them and they can make out after school. Trust me, when he's struck by Cupid's machine gun in the tush, you'll know.|`|lLEP9nsFaa	I would have never known- except for dating guys that I thought I was in love with- then once you meet "the one" You know- they fit you to a T , they are your best friend and the treasure you.. which is awesome!|`|CxWf6FdZaa	only you can truly answer your question.<br>  <br>  just make sure you use your head first, women's intuition is very powerful and very reliable.|`|vcAbomjAaa	well the best indication that you're in love is when you start taking a bath even if you don't want to. You know that he's in love with you when he doesn't smell like feet anymore... and you now brush your teeth|`|9SHaFZyOaa	Well, you are going out. So I bet he likes you a lot. And I don't know about love. I thought I was in love once, but now, I'm not to sure. |`|anrgNMqMaa	Okay first you know your in love when you care about that person and want to be around them 24/7.  It doesn't matter what people say about him like if they don't approve of him it doesn't matter to you. & if he cares about you he'll do things for you without getting snotty about it. He'll want to see you happy and he'll do whatever it takes.<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. :)|`|zdCG6LX5aa	you know when your in love cuz that person will never leave your mind or your thoughts or your heart. Everything that you will think of will somehow lead back to him. like you could be watching a movie and see a someone eating a pickle and think hey thats my bf favorite snack or just little things like that. You just wont be able to get enough of him. Everytime the phone rings...you will think its him...everytime you hear his voice you will have a smile on your face...everytime you see him you get butterflies...ect. |`|jgjh7B22aa	u know ur in love when he is all you think bout.<br>  u know ur in love when he is all you want.<br>  u know ur in love when you stop saying that "ohh he is hot" cuz all u want is him and nobody else and u dont care about them.<br>  you know your in love when u will do anything for him.<br>   if your not going out with him, you know your in love when all you want is for him to be happy even if he is not with you.<br>  u know your in love when all u want is to sit with him under the stars and lay in his protect arms and fall asleep in each others arms! <br>  that is how you know your in love! <br>  <br>  ?<br>  -sweet heart :D|`|b3758c508557194b65582d85675fd901aa	It is not love because you wouldn't have asked the question. In the meanttime enjoy each others company and see what happens but that L word is huge I wouldn't mention it unless you really do know. If he likes you he likes you don't push him away though|`|1cfe2dd8081416b6eec5587b7df4c64faa	no one on this website can tell  you when you are in love. it's just a feeling that you feel. I am currently in a relationship. I know that I'm in love because loving him is as natural as breathing. It is not forced. |`|hsyzHOVTaa	well he is ur boyfriend they usually like u if they are going out with you lol<br>  u know u are in love when:<br>  ur heart beats faster when u see him (cliche i know but it actually happens!)<br>  u cant imagine a future without them there<br>  when u dont see them ur heart hurts<br>  u cant stop thinking about them no matter what u do|`|Tv9w0LuOaa	u just know when yur in love<br>  <br>  if u have to ask a bunch of strangers a serious question like that, you should really search deep in your heart to see how you feel|`|MbQoKoIXaa	i think u know your in love when you think about this person all the time, can't wait until you  get to see them, and are happy |`|m2V33T3faa	im in the same fix
8445498a066182908045258b3eca3b35aa	you can't make anyone fall in love with you...<br>  can anyone make you love someone you don't?...|`|JEnGz5I4aa	by being sweet and nice to him/her and being mature|`|DvbEyQTAaa	It's impossible to make someone fall in love with you - but the best thing to do right now is be yourself. Let them know that you want to hang out, as friendly manner only, and use that to get to know each other more as people. From there, you can build an emotional relationship that may someday lead to love. Either that, or you may realize that they just aren't the one for you.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.<br>  <br>  Afterthought:<br>  Never pull a Sandy from Grease...it's not worth changing who you are for your summer fling, no matter how good you think you two would be together.|`|AA10037815	You can't. You cannot force another person to love you. They do or they don't. That's it. <br>  <br>  Sorry, that sounds mean....I don't mean it to be that way. |`|P6qd7rY1aa	By being yourself.

Im sure that she has alot of respect for you and what you are doing for your family. Good luck!|`|yQl4fiJAaa	go out with her! nothing should stop love|`|lHQmFQOTaa	First of all, it is wonderful that you are taking responsibilites like this at a young age. I am very sorry for you lost. If this girl can not understand and appreciate you for being a great guy like this, then find someone better. Make sure she is supportive and do explain to her all the elements of your new role in life. This should not mean that you need to stop your relationships however. If a stranger is understanding and think what you are doing is great, then you will meet many other girls who will think the same. Good luck and God bless.|`|h5p9exIDaa	Hi Dear,<br>   I see nothing wrong with dating an older woman. You have explain to her what is going on and she is find with it.

When I was 20 i think it would have been fine. It really just depends on how mature this girl is. If she says its fine than maybe it is. It is hard to trust someone after getting your heart broken but you can't keep a shield around your heart forever.
PIzz6hWFaa	If you are the same type of person, then staying friends with her would be OK.<br>  <br>  If you respect yourself, and don't want anything to do with drugs, then being friends with a person who gives drugs such a high priority is not a good thing. Maybe the friend you knew when you were younger was a great person, but it sounds like that is not the case now.<br>  <br>  People change as they grow. Some grow into great people, but others grow into people who would be better out of your life. It's a sad part of life, having to judge which people you want to be friends with, but it must be done. If you include someone like this in your life, you are making a statement about what is important to you.<br>  <br>  |`|6tv7vZelaa	Wow, that's a tough one.  I mean, it's hard to just let go of a friend, but if the sole reason is because she wanted to be able to drink and do drugs...I don't know if I'd break it off completely, but she would definitely lose a chunk of respect.  Hell, I'd respect her more if she did it because she was simply scared of having the kid...<br>  <br>  Anyway, that's just my opinion.  |`|BLGUGzipaa	Depends, we tend to hang around the type of people we are most like. If you are selfish and uncaring like your friend yes, however, if you have grown and these are not your value, I would distance myself from her. You don't want  her values tor rub off on you.|`|CxWf6FdZaa	uh well what is your definition of friendship?|`|X0YPrWrraa	yes of course remain friends...what ever the offer is she obviously is still way to young to go threw with a pregnancy...<br>  she was being honest and saying that she couldnt do it cuz she wants to drink, drug, etc...<br>  plus, bein 19 and prego is not fun and gives you a bad rep.<br>  <br>  get over it<br>  <br>  there are a ton of great babies/ kids that need a home..<br>  adopt one<br>  |`|aCdOkLcTaa	At this point in my life I only surround myself with friends that have the same values and morals that I do. I would say goodbye to her. What exactly are you getting out of the friendship? Is she an excellent friend?|`|CBPL6Tp6aa	Um...what she did shows bad character and that she doesnt care about herself...honestly she'd probably bring a caring person like you down with her. So in other words No i would not remain friends with her.|`|BTzzWHSjaa	that's ridiculous. if you are not that type of person, i say that you shouldn't associate yourself with that. |`|3f0056b2e2f2e7d0b6987dce3e56b109aa	Absolutely not!!!  |`|b0KXsyg3aa	Oh wow. No, no way. Those poor people. Drop her like a ton of bricks. she's not a good person to be around. |`|CqXGTnfpaa	I think that you should stay friends..This is a very tough time, and although your views are not the same, the fact that she has confided in you and has felt that you would not judge her...Alot of people say what other people want to hear, but to tell someone your true deep and nasty feelings shows how deep her friendship and respect for you is..She is obviously not ready for the child, and it will always be there as a reminder, if it was adopted  dont judge to many children are born without the love that they need.The fact she never accepted because she new she would lead a vertious life for the child proves that she does care..Its easier to have a child than a dog..So in short be there for her, I am sure in the end you will see her true personality coming out , and remember one day you may need someone to show your darkside to|`|bdIXXUPvaa	no|`|tOWqXCdtaa	Absolutely not. That's just heinous.

Be patient and calm and if it's meant to work out, he'll come to you. Worrying about it is only going to clog up your mind and distract you from living your daily life. Trust me, stop thinking about it, and he'll probably call you soon. Take care.|`|Wv592rOqaa	You do not share if he has a job or is a student.  Perhaps he has some demands that are taking up his time.  Do you have a telephone number for this guy?.  If so, give him ring.  We need more details and what were your gut feelings about going out on a date with him.  In the meantime don't sit around moping about him, do whatever you were doing before he came into your life and do it better (hopefully it was something great).  Also, do not allow your emotions and self-esteem to be tapered into thinking there is something wrong with you.  Sometimes it really isn't you, it's him!   Hang in there! |`|ySj7IeW0aa	It could be that he is nervous. especially if he likes you, I would give him a call if you like him or wait another day then call him if he don't call you. <br>  <br>  Good luck,<br>  Bone.|`|f1LdBJccaa	Hes just playing by the 'rules'.

eFaoa8uKaa	That's a tough one right there. A year is not that long to be with someone. If you think he is cheating; trust your gut feeling. You are snapping at him and making both of you upset, which leads to more animosity between you two. Just weigh out the pros and cons of being in a relationship with him: is it worth for you to traumatize yourself and him, deal with anger, mistrust, jealousy? The more paranoid you get, the more likely he's to cheat or break up with you.<br>  you say you don't want anyone but him: why? Are you just that used to him? Because it really doesn't seem that you truly "love" the guy.|`|zYgYJsCqaa	It seems as though his not interested anymore. Maybe it's time for you to move on. You can't be with someone that treats you like a stranger. <br>  <br>  I know you want to save this, but sometimes things are better off when you go your separate ways. Maybe he will come to his senses and beg you to forgive him and maybe you guys can work it out... Maybe all you need is space from each other... no communication what so ever. <br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope that everything works out for you! |`|CxWf6FdZaa	as you said its not working, so why should you settle for a stressful relationship. if there's no problem meeting up with new guys then maybe you want him because you can't have him. its over, accept and move on|`|olKKBFW8aa	you have the answer in ur heart nd that is just walk over it....there is no point going back nd trying to revive a relation which does not has the base "TRUST" so try to forget about him nd yeah he surely seems to be not very intrested in you..cant you see it ?|`|2bN75ozcaa	You have answered the question yourself and your family's have helped you make the decision   1 year is not a lot and you will get over it fairly quick|`|BAJUc80Faa	ask him if he <3s you|`|N9ujqRj0aa	its over baby, u 2 r just going through the motions....................|`|NUIWJOAoaa	hi dear, i can undastand what u r going thru. it's hurting and stressing. especially when u luv someone. we will tell u watever we wanna tel but its up 2 u 2 decide. do wat is right for u my luv, follow your heart, do sumthing that u wont regret at the end. let me tel u something, there's nothing more hurting like to break up with something though u still luv that person. it doesnt matter how complicated is your relationship. you have 2 build your relationship it doesnt build it's self. yes, theres a time where by you have 2 give up on sumething but not without giving it a try. communication is the best medicine of relationships.cheating is there and its gonna be there, give it a try dear. tel him what you feel about him.if u fil that u have tried and nothing changes than give up. 
lVuvUqoiaa	Good for you, get out of this toxic situation and do not take his calls again!  You deserve someone better who will love and appreciate you.  And it's only  been a week, it'll take a lot longer than that to get over him completely and be ready to move on.  Try going out with girlfriends a lot and pretty soon you'll find someone else you're attracted to and want to be with :-)|`|AA10997370	i know he's your first love, but this guy is an asshole!! i hope you can eventually get over him, for your own sake, and if not, to just rub it in his face lol|`|nSUHvlyaaa	don't you love yourself enough to not be degraded and used like that?<br>  <br>  i did love my ex alot and i thought i would never get over him... he hurt me soo much, i cant even count the number of times i tried to kill myself over him. But I'm over it now, because he's the past. He's not the only man in the world.

He is out there looking for you.|`|OG4410bdaa	I prefer<br>  "now I lay him down to sleep<br>  I pray my soul, my lover to keep<br>  heavens guide us through the night<br>  and wake us with the morning light"<br>  <br>  btw...I guess that's a nice prayer but some of what is asked for are things that I either would not want or would not care about...guess we're all just looking for something different in a man, which is great because there's alot of different types of men out there, and really I'm just lucky to have already found the one who was everything I was looking for<br>  best of luck having your prayers answered|`|1uRUaSblaa	Ha...very very amused..:)<br>  I'm smiling!:)|`|e5CGDYenaa	I wish i can find a man like that to............I know one day Jesus is going to send my true soul mate to me..............|`|lAQG15kdaa	haha thats great|`|mCM363I9aa	keep praying sister
1BgdsSG2aa	LOL!  Thanks, I needed that!|`|sMssDP1Xaa	You could also add, "I knew you were a politician".|`|l00Lo2zDaa	You are on a roll today. LOL  another good one that was much needed.|`|AA10240928	Stop it, you're killing me.
3bu2QCfnaa	I dont think hes giving up on you. It probably hurts alot to see his daughter sick and its weighing alot on him. He probably just had a tough day and since its putting so much strain on him, snapped. I'm sure he didnt mean it and feels bad for saying it. Of couse they want thier daughter better but its really hard on parents when thier kid is sick and they have no control. Expecially since your an adult, your not a baby anymore and need to take control over your own life its probably hard that he cant help. Did they put you thru treatment? If they did they care 100% theyre probably hurting that they cant help there baby. Continue getting help and staying healthy.|`|869a923e153dd118c958218801d84b78aa	Well, at least your dad has.  I mean, 4 times??   Super skinny??  I'd probably give up, too.   <br>  Good luck.  Hope you can get this under control before it kills you.|`|5PBRR4NVaa	They are prolly just accepting the situation and maybe that is for the best.  Now it's up to you to change because this kill-myself behavior won't garner the attention you seek.|`|3GHXk05saa	It sounds like they're giving up on arguing about it. Not giving up on you, but not nagging so they don't drive you away. Maybe reverse psychology.
AA12227416	a friend is someone who changes your life just by being part of it. someone who makes you laugh until you can’t stop. someone who makes you believe that there is really good in the world. someone who walks in when the rest of the world walks out. Someone that knows what you’re saying when you don’t say a word. someone you can look to in a certain way, and they know exactly what you’re thinking. someone you find hardest to say goodbye to. someone who knows all about you, and loves you anyway. someone who helps you through thick and thin. the first person you go to when you need someone to talk to. someone you will call to talk about nothing, or the most important things in your<br>  life. they are the shoulder you cry on, because you know that they really care about you. someone you would take a bullet for because it would be too painful to watch them get<br>  hurt. someone that will risk their friendship with you, just to make sure you’re safe and<br>  okay. someone you can always be around, and never get sick of.|`|htWw0OlCaa	You know, I don't even know any more... I ve been stabed in the back so many times by "so called friends", that Im just not sure any more..<br>  I thought a good friend is someone who will be there for you and talk when you need to talk. Someone who's got your back and wont hurt you, or stab you in the back. <br>  A friend is suppose to be a treasured gift. Someone who shares the bad and the good. I thought a friend is suppose to be kind and patient with you. Someone to keep you from being lonely. A person you can always trust. But, in my experiences, I have found that there really isn't someone like that. They all seem to hurt me or stab me in the back. Sorry.... I just couldn't help my self... Best wishes|`|CoNRevnraa	Okay, in my opinion a good friend is someone that you can pour your heart out to, and they'll never tell anyone unless its okay with you.<br>  A good friend always knows how to make you smile if your feeling sad! <br>  <br>  Usually when I make friends at skool, I look for ppl that are funny, confident, trustworthy, outgoing, and kind. <br>  <br>  People with these traits usually end up being amazing friends! :]|`|KmULmT7Baa	Listen to your friend, be interested in their life, don't be abusive, user, etc. nothin' to it.|`|Vx9Lvt9Aaa	a real friend ................. you can tell the truth too without ..them getting their feeling hurt or mad at you......<br>  <br>  and i notice real friends look out for you as if they were in ur shoes|`|5R0omMVnaa	Someone who is there for you when you least expect it. To stand up for you when you're too scared.
5r7RAgXuaa	yes ofcourse I do, more than anything, well most of the time, lol.|`|cRtHX2CGaa	of course; we had our ups and downs but they are the best :)|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	yeah...|`|AA12178731	no i don't but i like them|`|5FhRoNVUaa	they are the most important people in the world to me.  even though I have fought with them, they are still my parents and I love them.  they gave me life.  they raised me, fed me, and taught me everything they know.  always remember they will always love you no matter what.|`|7b5CfjeWaa	i love ma whole family. familyz not only there for the good timez but also for the bad.|`|70MRFokCaa	depends on waht they do like my parents are from the old days in the old country so for me no free dom outside only building everything else is like no you cant go blah blah but everything else i love them for|`|OWGA6cFKaa	Of course.

Even when I was a teenager and she told me things that I knew was right but did not want to hear it..but that never change the fact that I love her. We have always had a close relationship and I would not know what I would do w/o her.No matter what ups and downs me and my mother went through with each other..that will NEVER change the fact that I love. She has been there with me through the good and bad. When I really needed her she has not ever once turned her back. NO matter what we do for our parents we can never repay back what they have did for us.|`|fajdCVupaa	Of Course I lvoe my parents so much. What kidna of dumb question is this. Your parents helped you throguh everything. They helped you theough all the mistakes you've made and will continue helping you.|`|KXuNNj11aa	YES!!!  My parents are wonderful.  I hope you are able to love your parents too.  It is sad to think that there are a lot of families that don't love and support each other.|`|ddinVDEXaa	Yes.

I don't tell them enough.|`|twVyisGnaa	Yes, I do.  After watching this movie called Gracie's Choice and after I've heard about what some kids without parents deal with in juvenile hall, I've really learned to appreciate what my parents have done for me.  They've made me the awesome 18 year-old man I am today, and that's the greatest thing they've given me.<br>  <br>  You've reminded me of how much I love my mom and dad.  Thank you.<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!

Ann7Jyhoaa	Tell him real men don't steal,<br>  'Steal' something off him, but if his parents don't know tell them first or you could get in some sort of trouble =)<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work I reckon he will just grow out of it if you keep telling him it is wrong, or keep taking the toys back to the teacher without telling him, say the teacher stole them back =)|`|pKzH1cFHaa	Tell them what happens when people steal. Prices go up, security is tighter, they can get kicked out of the store, get community service, and/or jail time.|`|4f3GfrN6aa	Talk to his parents about the problem.  Perhaps, with their help, you could arrange to have something 'stolen' from him (taken from his room while he is out, and concealed by his parents).  Then he will experience the sense of loss from having something stolen.  It might make an impression.|`|gC8xO53Oaa	Tell him the consequences of breaking the law. Do you know a police officer that can talk to him? Sometimes it can make a big impression on them if a police officer just talks to them. Go to the police station and show them what could happen when they get older if he keeps on.|`|OWGA6cFKaa	Tell him if he makes it a habit, his hands will bleed horribly for the rest of his life and will cause terrible agony. That should do it.|`|xv2r0Gsdaa	how old is your cousin?|`|6Eb4QhI5aa	If your 5 year old cousin get an allowance from parents, tell them to hold back his allowance, that will teach him not to steal, and also once he has enough money for the value of the toys stolen he would have to pay up to the teacher for the value of the toys that he stole, its almost like he is paying a fine for the items that he stole, it may sound harsh but will teach him to not steal.|`|KXuNNj11aa	You just need to keep telling them how important it is to be honest and truthful, and let your cousin know that it is illegal and if they get caught the real trouble will begin.|`|angTzfV2aa	Take something belonging to him/her and hide it for a while!|`|goY0JHzlaa	Tell on him.|`|wqgEo3gyaa	i'd set her/him up to get busted.
95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Yes. There is sexual love for one's marriage partner, but it's not like you have to keep all your love for one person. If you enjoy spending time with someone else, talking with them, share common interests and miss them when they're gone, you love them. It doesn't have to be anything sexual.|`|f03edf3d3fe5d3e7c31416dd3871939aaa	yes|`|c1qLIB4Eaa	Dear Gatsby,<br>  <br>  Great relationship of 40 years !!

Better go and check them when they met in alone and if you find every thing positive then never ever re-think on this aspect again.<br>  <br>  Start loving her as much as you can. Try to find out the reason of their friendship and then give it to her. You can break their friendship by your MORE love and MORE care.<br>  <br>  All the best and God Bless.|`|XT81GCu1aa	I'm a little confused as to why you care...post more info as in, are you her confidante, are you interested, etc. so we can help you|`|MXGFGBtZaa	It's possible, but come on, they're best friends.

bzpUZkEDaa	talk to you husband about it, it sounds like your not expressing how you feal about him, if he is such a good guy im sure that he'll understand and put his kids and you first over getting waisted and smoking weed|`|mtOVRAnbaa	Get him to want to stay home ;-) If ya know what i mean... get a babysitter... bring some sexy back =) ... and as far as the friend.. If they have been friends for that long.. I WOULDNT try and break that up .. to you he may be a bad influence but to your husband thats his best friend.. If he has fun he has fun ... "boys will be boys"... And as far as the DUI goes.. hes a grown man he makes his own decisions.. good luck|`|vPvYTPpvaa	first try talking about it but if that doesnt work tell him if he doesnt lose the friend hell lose you|`|vRe6CwgEaa	Tell you want Friday nights and either Sat or Sun with no friend and you'll make it a weekend he'll never forget.  Maybe give him a preview of some kind.|`|IvMPh09baa	wow... and you bring this man around your kids?<br>  <br>  I really hope you don't tell them he is their role model.<br>  <br>  Honestly.... you need to wake up, its not his friends fault.  Its YOUR HUSBAND that is doing this.  He is his own person and makes his own decisions, I'm pretty sure his friend doesn't have a gun to his head telling him to smoke pot.. now does he?<br>  <br>  What I am truly concerned about is the fact that you don't want to leave him... I mean seriously... you have kids... and your bringing this man around them.  Do you understand the kind of chaos that makes in your house.  Your kids see his behavior, and if you don't teach your kids that you won't put up with it then pretty soon one of two things will happen, or maybe both.  A.  your kids will start to treat you like he does, with no respect and completely out of control.  Or B. Your kids will become the SAME person that he is, because they look up to him.<br>  <br>  You choose, what do you want for YOUR kids... a complete idiot that has no control or a stable household|`|vXubuAqzaa	TELL HIM TO GROW UP..

4ssSgfYEaa	He needs counseling as soon as possible.<br>  He could have been molested, and that is why he acts out sexually.<br>  <br>  He may need medication also.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let him around the 3 year old daughter either!<br>  <br>  He really needs help.<br>  <br>  Military school is terribly expensive!|`|NuvKPl3naa	this is really hard to answer. in my opinion he sounds like he has been abused. and meds and some little counseling is not going to help. he really needs full time attention and serious help. being so young and doing those things are not as you know the normal. his mother is going to have to step up and be serious about this, or they may end up taking him from her home. he will have the chance to come to your home being your husband is the father. if you dont take him he will go to foster care. i am thinking you would be willing to take him to counseling etc. but there is only so much you can do with the other kids safety. i would do what you can on your part, but sadly it wont work unless everyone is involved. good luck|`|E7TkNO00aa	Maybe he acts this way because he would've had been molested by someone. What does your husband think about all this? Both of you need to take him to counseling and give him lots of love. Maybe he wants attention and this is the only way he gets it by acting out. What worries me is that he is hitting your little girl and fingering his cousin. There has to be a reason why he's doing this. Have you talked to his mom about this issue? I applaud you for wanting to help your step son. Good luck.|`|bzxPBkbtaa	he obviously has some serious issues. what is the story with the mom? He needs some counseling. Dont blame yourself for keeping him away from your 3 year old, he is obviously a physical and sexual danger to her. Dad should be spending one on one time alone with him until some of his issues are under control then he can be reintroduced to the rest of the family. good luck.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	He needs discipline and a firm MAN over him. He needs a MALE INSTRUCTOR. HE NEEDS A MALE ROLE-MODEL. SOMEONE STRONG in MIND AND IN BODY to GUIDE HIM
gC8xO53Oaa	Girl B because a personality is something that you 'll have a lifetime, and looks always fade. What would you have left if all she had was beauty.

I feel like she's trying to hard too be friends, but what can i do? i don't wanna alienate her, but she's really starting to annoy me. she's not exactly a loser, but i think she's weird. she tries to make herself seem like this rich girl, but i don't understand why she lives in an apartment if she's so rich! well, that's not the point. Point is, trust me, for me it doesn't look like B will be going anywhere soon, and it doesn't look like that in your case either. How about we give them a chance? Maybe we might be able to tolerate them...|`|yTYFgkFxaa	maybe you should give B a chance, you could really like her. She might be nice and so what if she's weird, isn't everyone? If you're not, than you're stupid. and what exactly is a "Loser", no one is a loser, everyone is different, giver her a chance, try and be friends|`|2pQUMKb2aa	tell her that you feel uncomfortable with B around and you want to have alone time with just you and A
Wf8PbTraaa	wow thats odd.<br>  <br>  part of being a kid is spending the night at friends house...it builds relationships and friendships.<br>  <br>  i'd talk to your dad and ask what are some things you can do to get the privledges to sleep over at your friends.|`|TAMGy07Daa	figure it out with your parents, tell your parents to talk to theirs about it, and tell them that sleeping over isn't a bad thing all the kids do it, its completely normal, i for once, sleep over at my friends house alot that the whole family know me and i can just walk in the house whenever i want :3|`|5feebbaef078c57e8b297a04969b8f72aa	Do you happen to be asian lol?

I know how hard it is to convince parents sometimes but on the bright side, at least you get to have your friends sleepover..that's still cool.
lQx6UH1maa	>>  should I still CALL this GIRL?<br>  <br>  Let's observe the facts.<br>  <br>  >>  I have known a girl from University since November.<br>  <br>  School should be your number one priority.<br>  <br>  >>  she said “I’ve been looking for a boyfriend that can care for me."<br>  <br>  Translation:  Meal ticket.<br>  <br>  >>  She gave me a text on Jan/25th...with a picture of her and a her baby boy.<br>  <br>  Package deal.  Ready made family.  Another man's spawn.  Baby daddies never go away.  He will be in the picture at least until the child is eighteen.  He will be in her life when you are not.  He will remember how good she was and will always be trying to get some more of it.  It only takes one time for her to be upset with you to give in to him.  They have a very familiar history with each other.  You are simply a newcomer.  Exes do it all the time with each other because they are perceived as being safe.  The benefit?  No strings.<br>  <br>  <br>  Warning!!!...Warning!!!...Warning!!!<br>  <br>  It has become very common for a college girl to insure getting pregnant by a senior.  Why?  Because he will soon be a graduate and be recruited by a firm offering him a generous salary with benefits.  She sees this as a guaranteed monthly income that will rise as his salary rises over the next eighteen years.  Be warned.<br>  <br>  ~|`|gvojqNu4aa	I would say that if you really like her..then go for it. Although I do believed she should of been straight forward with you. I guess she had to get the feel of you before she told you. She probably thought that you would reject her, especially with her baby. Overall, if you like her..then follow your heart and go for it. If you two ever get close with each other...really close in a relationship remember that you may be seeing her ex-husband pretty regularly down the road especially sense they have a child together...if he's still around. Well good luck.|`|aDL7xmt6aa	no
AA10065812	*** Each state receives matching fund from the federal government for collecting child support so it's in THEIR best interest.  Besides, if you EVER go on Welfare, they will file a retroactive support order and keep all the money.
fLcAugPRaa	Unfornuately because you are underage and in the responsibility of your parents, your mother has the full right to make you move. I know it's unfair and not what you want, but consider maybe talking to your mother about what you would like to do. Tell her how you feel about her decision and how you disagree. It may help. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Since you're a minor I don't think you have a say so on who is in custody of you.  Sorry.|`|oDx3Jgdcaa	thats mean of your mom...well i dont think u can cause ur still a minor,but good luck|`|htWw0OlCaa	Actually at the age of 14 you can say who you want to live with, but also at the same time, you are still a minor. So, yes your mother can petition the court to have you go and live with your father. She doesn't have to have your consent or approval. I hate that you are having to go through all of this, I know from experience that it is rough. <br>  Best wishes|`|T3b4I4kXaa	At 16, you can determine which parent you wish to live with... the judge handling your custody arrangements will absolutely hear you. <br>  <br>  Now... your mom is trying to forcibly get rid of you? Either she is having a hard time making ends meet, or you are too much of a handful, or she has not been receiving child support... or all three. Of course, perhaps she is looking to start dating again and simply wants you out of the house... is there a man in the picture that may want you out?  It would be interesting to know what is really going on.<br>  <br>  The crazy thing is, you are only 2 years from being an adult... why force the issue now?  If you insist on graduating from your current high school, consider talking to your mom (or the judge) and asking for this reprieve. You can use the time to work part-time during the school week and full-time during breaks and summer vacation. Get a bank account and save your money so you will have deposits for your first modest apartment and utilities. All this should keep you out of your mom's hair most of the time.<br>  <br>  Chances are, if your mom can't come up with a good-enough reason for kicking you out, the judge will probably rule in favor of letting you stay there.|`|3bu2QCfnaa	I know in Massachusetts once you turn 14 you can decide who you want to live with thru the courts. Whats the reason she wants to send you away, are you trouble, financial problems? Maybe your father wants a turn raising you. If your father is a basterd and your mother is being neglectful then go to court and tell them this. Maybe theres a relative you can live with for the next 2 years.|`|b5eSmOhiaa	Hmm...Here in Michigan it's legal for a 16 year old to be out on their own.  However, if you're a minor in your state, then I think you have no choice.  But without your father's consent or signature, then I don't think she can move you.  Sorry if I'm judging here, but I wouldn't even want to live with a mom who wanted me out without my consent or approval...Good luck, though.|`|3WBbMSeHaa	My parents divorced when I was 13 and by law, I could make my own decision on who I wanted to live with no questions asked.

149253ebffac5c2c51116340a8c8dabaaa	First, you should try to extend your understanding. I think he has low self esteem now cuz of not being able to get a job. It's hard to feel that you're always being rejected. However, if he really wants to apply now, let him. Let's see if in this way, he could gain his confidence again.<br>  <br>  Second, try to talk to him nicely. I believe you can try to persuade a person when you talk to him/her in a nice way. Let him understand that you really want to go out with the person who's close to you. If he wants, he can come with you.<br>  <br>  Third, try to control your temper when he's mad (try not to be mad). Also, don't easily decide when your mad. Based on experience, your judgment is not good when you're mad.|`|IwTnhhJ7aa	so basically your paying for both of you to stay in the apartment. hes using you. in that manner. let the guy move out or pay up<br>  if he cant respect your feelings do you really gotta ask?<br>  <br>  you deserve someone who respects you!|`|NjBkMl3Yaa	it sounds like this guy doesn't know what he wants. You should sit down and have a genuine talk with him about the way he is making you feel and also remember to ask his opinion. Try to make a mutual agreement on stuff, and if he starts to get too controlling just leave him, I've known a lot of people who end up in controlling relationships, and it affects not only them badly but their family that loves them. So just do what Your heart tells you to.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	If the man wants a job then leave him be. He does not need a mother to tell him what to do. He will figure his own way and you are too controlling.|`|TJiGs8S4aa	It sounds to me more as if YOU are trying to control HIS life.  I don't think you two should be living together, honestly.  He does not sound very mature, and I don't think you realize how controlling you really are.
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	If he is bothering you, then report him for harrassment. Some guys think that just because some girls like being treated like they're strippers , getting smacked on the butt and stuff, that all the girls like it, report him for harrassment because it's belittling when someone is allowed to go around thinking hes god gift to women when hes so disrespectful. Hope this helps somehow.|`|zGgUsEmdaa	Lol there are always boys like that in every school. I'm the same it makes me sick. Yet the boy I know has a girlfriend, he still winks at me and stares at my butt. Urgh, you just ignore him. Ignore the hell out of him lol. xxx|`|eG6tjXp8aa	try and ignore him as much as possible, but if he gets too dam irritating give him a piece of your mind :D (in a non violent way.... if possible)<br>  that's what i'd do.|`|AA11103763	Ignore him -- but if he gets too annoying, take him down a peg or two. Sounds like you are a smart chick and can find ways to insult him. ;)|`|YWib1tlQaa	Ask yourself why you don't like him. Also consider that he may like you and this is why he is getting on your nerves: to get attention from you! <br>            Sit him down (or pull him off to the side) and tell him that he's been getting on your nerves...politely. Practice ahead of time, if you want!    <br>   Make sure to do it when neither of you have to do anything. <br>  <br>  Warn him a little more firmly if he keeps bothering you! Let him know you don't want it to happen again. <br>  <br>  Say "You know what? I'm done!" if he actually keeps on again! <br>  Ignore him just like you implied. If he tries to talk to you, act like he's not even there. Keep doing this until he says sorry. <br>  <br>  Forgive him! Tell him that you don't want him doing it again.|`|uojU3husaa	Hehe, boys can be annoying and acts like arrogant jerks sometimes, which is a BIG TURN OFF...hehe!<br>  <br>  Hehe, I'm laughing so hard as I'm reading your question.  I'm laughing, NOT because I have any negative impression about you or your question, but instead of your charming sense of humor as being a teenager.  Enjoy your teenage years, Brianna....It's most beautiful era in our lives.  Once you hit to college, going work, getting married, you'd be thinking back of the old days in grade school, NOT necessarily have to think about that guy who is annoying you, but in general, the wonderful memory that you share with your friends.<br>  <br>  Good night sweetie! ((HUGS))
p8yphpjYaa	If you're stressed to the max wondering how you're going to pay the mortgage/rent and put food on the table and buy your kid's school clothes, it makes you edgy and irritable, which, of course, makes everything else irritate you and more inclined to argue. If one person feels the other one is irresponsible with the couple's money, it makes the balance of responsibility one-sided, which leads to resentment and even more arguing, which leads to more resentment and feelings of the other person not "getting" you anymore, or not loving you enough to work together on sharing responsibility. All that leads to many other things, which can be deal-breakers. It may not be the money; it may end up being what the money represented.|`|XJ2BW5p7aa	It is in human nature to not be satisfied with what they have so naturally it is only expected that even the most compatible and in love couples will want to at some point improve their living/lives/live styles etc.<br>  <br>  Having said that it is not always easy to meet the new and raised expectations (even your own). This obviously causes some sort of disappointment which may then lead to more serious problems. <br>  <br>  So while it may seem that all you need is Love it is not always true. It depends on the state of mind. But in most cases having tasted something good you will desire more and this is the source of all problems. So it is best to say that everyone at some point will face the harsh reality of choice - lower your needs/expectations or continue down the path of your newly found or raised needs and wants.<br>  <br>  Money is the only thing that you will never get enough off. You get more and you spend more. Then you want even more because now you are used to spending more... Loop.<br>  <br>  And having explained that it is easy to explain all the other causes which probable stem off the money issue anyway.|`|aqj4E7Aeaa	It's always been about money, if it wasn't about money there wouldn't be a such thing as alimony.|`|AjjKETIxaa	Number 2 reason for Divorce is SEX.<br>  <br>  dunefreeman: I would argue with you about trust or Sex. <br>  <br>  If you/ any Male can not satisfy his female partner, trust does not help.|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	Because most married people aren't in love, though they may love each other.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Because they are or one of them is totally selfish. Better or worse isn't that part of their vow.|`|HFHNxQ0vaa	one of the reasons i am divorcing is cause my husband didn't help with any of the bills and we both have full time jobs. can u say LOSER??|`|pOTigVYPaa	Because love doesn't pay the rent.|`|5ajPMlrqaa	I don't think money is the reason that people divorce - I think that it's the inability to come to a mutual understanding on how to spend and save money. A couple that doesn't have common goals won't live in harmony!<br>  <br>  For instance, take the wife who wants to constantly spend any bonus money at the mall. She enjoys quality haircuts and brand-name apparel. She is the "spender". Her financial personality type will constantly be at odds with her husband if he is the penny pincher, clipping coupons from the Sunday paper, writing down every transaction, even if it's just $2 for a pop at the gas station. She views him as stingy, he views her as careless. They are opposites!<br>  <br>  If they can respect each other, and compromise, they will be ok. <br>  If they keep secrets from each other, that's a problem. If they set up separate accounts where they each spend as they choose yet come up with money for joint expenses, that can be an option. But the worst option is to not talk, and so many couples don't talk about money, so their bills go unpaid, they land in debt, and it ends in a hot mess!|`|wJZAwxrpaa	Because theres never enough of it for somebody at one time or another.|`|iTVoXWjxaa	egan its trust not sex, lol when did u become the soothsayer.|`|W1rCsvTzaa	I eliminated many, many potential wives during the dating process because I thought they were bad with money.  My wife is great at saving money which has made a huge difference over 20 years.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	I would of thought it was over sex...Thats what I want to fight over..<br>  <br>  NOT ENOUGH!|`|l43NSgHyaa	Marriage takes a lot more than love.   It's takes compatibility and friendship.    Sometimes, couples get married and find out they have different views on how money should be earned (and who should earn it) used, saved and spent.   As a result, people start to argue and fight about it.  That causes resentment in the relationship, which leads to hate and that breaks down any and all love, honor and respect in the relationship.<br>  <br>  Money makes the world go around.  Without it, how would you live?  Where would you live?  How would you eat?      So, it's easy for money issues to get in the way of many couples.|`|zNjACkxpaa	Because it is the number one thing married couples fight about. too little, too much, too much going to the wrong places.|`|rVLolY7raa	Because the money is spent on motel rooms.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Because love doesn't pay the bills.

gC8xO53Oaa	It's hard to make a parent do anything they don't want too, but have you tried telling them how it makes you feel? Maybe they don't realize how much they are drinking. If they're under a lot of stress like so many are these days, maybe they are just trying to forget it for awhile. Doesn't make it right though. I'd hope you could just talk to them and tell them how much you love them and you don't like seeing them consume so much.|`|tU5NJVL3aa	Record them when they are drunk and then make them watch it when they are sober.  Tell them how it looks to you and makes you feel:  Do you feel threatened in any way by their behavior?  Embarassed?  Depressed?
y0HwOMYcaa	Yes, I certainly do. Sometimes it kind of frustrates me though because even if your mad at them you just can't show it. To me that means that the people that you can't get mad at are the people that are really close to you and that's a good thing.|`|JBfgUoDzaa	oh yeah i do some of my friends gossip alot about me iam angry with them. some friends can be frustrating.|`|CoNRevnraa	The same thing happens to me a lot...my best friend that I've known for 11 years has a huge ego, and sometimes I just can't take it! <br>  A couple weeks ago, I told her that I couldn't deal with her problems and stuff anymore (it was more detailed than that, but yah lol) and I wanted to just yell at her, but yet I couldnt! <br>  <br>  I think it's because when you've known someone for so long, you just can't imagine yourself yelling at them!|`|6hMUrvfeaa	OMG im the same way. When i here my friends are mad or talking about me i just get so angry and want to do something about it but im afraid that if i voice my opinion that my "friends" will go and start stuff and create a bigger problem than it already is!
bacf6b8b32fbe29c531fe0e20342c6abaa	I would try and join a few clubs, so you can find buddies with common interests.<br>  <br>  And also try asking that guy in your English class if they want to study together in the student lounge sometime, perhaps you can quiz each other before a big test.<br>  <br>  Everything should fall into place for you soon....<br>  we've all been there!<br>  <br>  stay strong and just be yourself|`|WyjRm10jaa	Get to know what their interest..<br>  get involve with them.. & support them with their effort..<br>  when they think you are cool.. they will feel comfort to talk to you..<br>  don't forget to be nice & supportive..|`|TAMGy07Daa	The beggining year is always like that since freshmen are afraid of getting behind in college, give it time for the class to build chemistry!
sLmX4H3Caa	Lies hurt more. The truth can sting, but knowing someone was keeping the truth away from you, it makes you wonder if you can trust them.

You can lie to prevent hurting someone, as in "No, that skirt doesn't make your butt look big", or you can lie to prevent hurting someone as in, "No, I didn't go out with my ex-boyfriend last night," and the consequences are very, very different. <br>  <br>  Any lying that creates a negative pattern of continued lies (as it seems you are talking about) can do more harm than good, I agree. However, there are very specific times when I would prefer a good lie to the truth. There's no one answer to this vague question.|`|PNnYTqyzaa	It depends on the situation.<br>  White lies to conceal things that aren't important but could potentially be hurtful are less painful than the truth.<br>  But in more serious situations, lies can be just as bad, especially if they're found out.<br>  Generally it's better to tell the truth, or no-one will trust you. If the truth is hurtful then it's best to know straight out to give time to get over it, right?<br>  <br>  x|`|IGkm98Qqaa	Agreed! Although I lie to get out of urgent or embarrassing situations. In the long run, lying or falsehood is beyond bad because it denounces one of the most Positive/Greatest and Important concepts in the universe which is faith and trust.

It is better to hurt a person with the truth than to lie to them, and drag the lie out for days on end.  I would be told the truth in the beginning than to be lied to, so this is the rule I stand by.|`|wYrS24e2aa	well it depends. if its a lie when it comes to someone asking you if they look fat in their pants or something then its okay so you wont hurt their feelings. But if its something more serious like you destroyed someones possesion and you lie then thats bad.
nCWjdyddaa	Try asking them to do something specific. Like, "Nancy, could you clear the dishes from the table, please;" or, Bob, how about putting the leftovers in these dishes for me." You might be surprised.|`|ScHW4842aa	LOL|`|eVK2zZsOaa	No, Fortunately I don't have that problem. You should definitely talk to your husband about that one.

The second would be to again take a look at the situation and see if your mother is really an unfit mother as in does she provide a healthy enviroment for you, does she abuse you to the extreme that she would grab objects, etc, etc. and then get in contact with child protective services and go through the process of getting you out of the enviroment.

CzfTxttBaa	don't be nervous. my kids went and it helped them alot. i also went to alanon. i did leave my husband but it was for the best. it helps you to deal with  an alcoholic. it also helps to know there are teens that are just like you and going through the same stuff and sometimes worse. please don't be afraid and try it it will help you.|`|GWKW94jqaa	you should really go and atleast try it out..<br>  dont worry i was nervous at first too, and to tell you the truth i hated it, but then after a while it seemed pretty fun and it helps alot too!!!
Q5BM2POnaa	You can't control anyone else's thoughts or actions other than your own.<br>  <br>  Given that is a fact, it's foolish to expend mental or physical energy on trying to change someone else.<br>  <br>  All you can do is be yourself, be the best person you can be, know you will make mistakes, learn from those mistakes and don't repeat them.<br>  <br>  If, after all that, people still see you in a way that's not accurate, it's probably time to find other people to hang around.  If they are family, however, you could try talking to them about your feelings.  Obviously something must have given them the impression.|`|95b3c1cab8a1f1f08d03b46eefc17755aa	Just go ahead and do your own thing, and as long as it doesn't interfere with them, there's nothing at all they can do about it.|`|7511595fc4d3e31538e8df239de8a7c5aa	maybe your point of view is wrong or they don't think it is correct.  there are a lot of factors in this one.  but in the end, people see what they want to see.  always!!!|`|lGdzb8aqaa	Some times it is as simple as letting people see who the real you is, and maybe then they can see who you really are, and as for family, what is it that you do to show your self as the person they raised, are you a kind , considerate, caring person, do you offer any form of help when they need it, or are you a person who has led them to think you have no concern for any one except your self, with that being said, at this point ask what you have done to make people see you the way they do.and what you can do to change how they feel and if it is really important to you start with you, no one needs to be convinced as to your good heart it shows and maybe you should wash your rose colored glasses. good luck.|`|ZbMf6cppaa	Unfortunately you can't "make" people do anything.  There are three perceptions of "you". Who you are inside, the you that you show to others, and the perception others have of you. Maybe if you stop trying to make them see what you feel is the real you then they will start taking you more seriously and will put more value in your point of view.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	with some ppl you can't win...the best thing to do is keep trying to prove your point to them. if they don't see the real you then move on.<br>  <br>  just cuz they're your family doesn't mean you need their approval. hell if they were truly family they would take your word.|`|CoNRevnraa	With some people, they always end up thinking they're right. <br>  In the end, you can't change someone's outlook on you or your personality.
c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	He probably does like you, if you don't like him just make sure you dont send him the wrong signals, that happened to me one year or high school lol
jlEyE088aa	let her consult a professional as soon as possible|`|bL9APqogaa	Well, maybe you could try and talk to her by yourself or with one other person. This could get really serious and she could become addicted to drugs. Another thing is, does her parents know about it? If her parents really show that they love her, then you should probably tell them. You have to be careful when telling parents because some might through a fight and kick her out. Make sure you know the parents before you tell them. Talk to her by yourself and tell her that you care about her. That you enjoy having her as a friend but you are worried about her. Show concern but don't blow it. Make sure she realized that you are sincere. <br>  And if she won't listen, just stand beside her until she wants your help.
mAZi1eH7aa	Don't write her off. She is family. Be the bigger person and open the door.|`|68qLU6dHaa	try and talk to her,,if it does not work, then just let it go and get on with your life
6hMUrvfeaa	Okay so the best advice i could give you is to not talk about these friends to anyone, not even your best friend. The reason is because lets say one day you and your best friend get into a fight well that friend would probably go and tell another one of your friends what you said about her/him and it will create More Drama. I would bond with these girls/guys always text them or talk on the phone and go have sleepover ( with the girls ) and just talk about boys with them because yall will get closer that way! Good luck! Hope i helped! :D|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	The best thing would be to not talk bad about anyone otherwise you will get the reputation of being a back stabber, or untrustworthy. Remember to keep your own style and just have fun, and you will come across those bad friends, the key to going through that is to just keep things friendly but just cut ties with them.|`|5R0omMVnaa	You only lost them because you let them go. I doubt anything you had a fight over was a matter of life and death. If you aren't willingly to go through some problems, then your only friend would be yourself. And even then it won't always work out....|`|llOc2gM4aa	Here are some ways that I used to keep friends:<br>  <br>  1. Always spend time with your friend, but don't spend EVERY second of the school day with her.<br>  2. Be sure to make time for your friend on the weekends.<br>  3. If you're in a bad mood, try hard not to get angry at your friends. Sometimes girls just get in a terrible mood and hurt friends by getting mad at them even if the friends are just being their plain selves. Control yourself.<br>  4. Listen when your friend talks to you. Keep in mind or write down important info she tells you through conversation (such as her birthday, some things she likes or dislikes)<br>  5. Don't do anything that makes her feel uncomfortable. If you are the really loud or outgoing one in your group of friends, don't go overboard and embarress your friends unless it's what you normally do anyway.<br>  6. Think before you speak. Sometimes you say offending or mean things right in front of or with your friends.
CoNRevnraa	Its good to kno that you at least TRY not to judge others! <br>  Some ppl have a major problem with judging others they don't even kno! <br>  <br>  You may just be jealous of the fact that guys are attracted to her or the fact that she might be popular (if she is...?).|`|qbbNtGVcaa	everyone goes through that. i know this is hard to say and so but maybe you should be come friends with her. you guys can probably bond since u sra so opposite. :) it might become a good friendship. and guys sometimes like girls like that..i know its weird but maybe u are jealous of that. and everyone judges someone sometimes its natural. just don't go around saying she's weird or anything. that would be just mean. well good luck! :) hope this helps|`|c7556581726e3b12eec9ed5be7a3fb82aa	Maybe you should just try and stop judging people, yeah it happens, but the only way to get over judging people is to get to know her, or at least talk with her, and get to know what she is like, maybe shes got a really good personality. But by talking to her would be the only way to find out, and you might surprise yourself that you were wrong about her.|`|2b8CKFAGaa	I think you judging others signifies that you are more confident in establishing and supporting your own opinions. Although judging people at first is seldom accurate, one "trait" (call it a foible if you may) of human nature is reacting instantly to its surroundings. People judge to determine what they should do, but you doing so is not a bad sign, unless you start to impart these judgments aloud.|`|GpdYgi4Zaa	jealousy. and its not embarassing to be jealous of someone. a lot of girls are always jealous of something or someone. so its pretty obvious you maybe jealous of her.<br>  <br>  my mom always said try judging yourself before you do others. No one is perfect.|`|5R0omMVnaa	I think your jealous because of the guy thing|`|borw2oKCaa	just seems like human nature.

nCWjdyddaa	I have been married for over 35 years, and I still call my MIL by her first name. It's not disrespectful, it's just what is comfortable for me. The one exception is when I tag a gift, in which case I put "Mom (Last Name)."|`|eVK2zZsOaa	No, I don't call her anything because I barely talk to her. We are on a hello/good-bye basis and that is it. I wouldn't feel right calling her mom. I don't think she would feel right with me calling her mom. I don't know anybody who does that.|`|oK6sZ2fmaa	NO, my mom is so special to me and only she deserves that title, no mother- in-law could every measure up to my mom. Just me being me.|`|ZooFCqMjaa	i call mine hitler coz thats who shes like!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|68qLU6dHaa	I asked if I could call her Mom  right after marrying her son and was told yes.

But, it is up to the individual.|`|AA11103763	My mother-in-law died before I married my husband, but he calls my mother "Mom".

I have no idea how women or men get married and want nothing to do with their inlaws.|`|5bde15709483c28deedecc65456b59a2aa	No.  She told me I could call her mom, but I prefer not to.
HZgjUguWaa	yes leave|`|o6xLWwZvaa	No matter how many years you been together, or how many terrible times he helped you through. Why stay in a relationship when you are not happy? Why stay with him when you can't trust him? Why stay with him when you fight, when he doesn't care or love you?<br>  <br>  Forget about those 6yrs. You are 20, your adult life is just starting. Those past 6yrs you were a teen, you were only living a teen life. Your life starts when you become an adult. <br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor dump him. leave him for good. Move on with your life. Live on your own (if you dont already), work on building a life of your own. Right now all you know is life with him. So you are afraid to be on your own, but you have too break into surviving on your own.|`|p8yphpjYaa	Just because you've been with someone through hell and high water for a few years doesn't mean that they are the right person to be with. Be glad he was there when you needed him, but it doesn't sound like he's all that healthy to be around if he's verbally abusive. Maybe that's why your mom doesn't want you too together, did you ever think about that? Maybe your mom had been around the block a time or two when she was younger and recognized some of the same traits in a past boyfriend. Moms do know some things, you know. And even if that's not it, it doesn't sound like you and he are compatible now, even if you may have been a few years ago. Cut your losses, move on, stay in therapy, get yourself happy and healthy, and be with a man who can be a man.|`|1EhbLBkUaa	It's both.  And your therapist is right, he needs his own therapist to work on his own issues; if he can't -- or won't -- control himself, if he wants to try, he's got to work on that himself.  You can't fix him.  Your therapist can't fix him. His own can't fix him either but he/she can try to help him fix himself, if he wants to.<br>  <br>  Having your own therapist is a good step too; I wonder if he/she has pointed out yet that you moved from verbally abusive mother to verbally abusive boyfriend.  Something in you may be comfortable with that familiar pattern of abuse and seek it out.  I don't mean consciously; who ever says, "Hey, I miss someone being mean to me so I can cry and try to get them to stop when they won't"?  It's an insidious pattern of habit and familiarity you fall into.  Search for resources on codependence.<br>  <br>  Why do you need to ask him to stop hurting you?  Why do you even keep trying to get him to stop by begging and crying?  You say it has never worked.  Insanity is doing the same thing over and over, and expecting something to change.  The next time he starts getting abusive, tell him you won't take that, and leave.  He can rant to himself all he likes; you don't have to stand there and take it, give him the power to hurt you.|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	It's abuse and it don't matter whether or not it is verbal, physical, sexual or emotional, it's still abuse.  Yes you need to get out of this relationship and move on.  Let this be a lesson to you that when your friends and family don't like your boyfriend there is usually a reason.|`|goY0JHzlaa	Ughhh....you really need to get rid of him. Just because he gets mad at you is no reason to say hurtful things and has already dumped you. SO, go to your therapist and work on yourself. You don't need him to go. Let him get his own therapist. He apparently has his own issues he needs to work on.
AA12135516	Looks are only skin deep, it's the personality that counts but if you keep calling yourself ugly then your self esteem is probably low & your true personality will never come out. Stop thinking negative about yourself because that will be your biggest downfall not the gap in your teeth. Just for the record one of my sons had a gap in his teeth but it never worried him & he's always had lots of friends & good relationships with girls. Someone told me once that a gap in your teeth is a sign of intelligence & i did tell my son that when he was younger.Whether it's true or not try thinking that way cos it might help boost your confidence. Good Luck!|`|H1eshhEIaa	I would.    I just love freckles on a girl.

When you go threw life angry you only hurt yourself. You make stupid decisions cause you aren't thinking straight. Keep in mind that your parents aren't just your parents,they are human beings who deserve to be happy to.. If they are miserable with each other,they may need to be apart. You can't go threw life giving and not getting anything back. It hurts your whole being,you get drained. Support your younger siblings and help them deal with it. Hopefully your parents will handle it like adults,and not drag you kids into their problems.|`|Tw0Ci97Yaa	talk to him in private first. a father should never do that to a family. if he does that he is weak. and he is no man. he never tired hard enough and needs to grow up. tell him that if he loved you he would try to keep this family together and not be a coward. tell him to be a man and own up to his responsibilites. he has a family and he made a vow that he would be there for the good and bad. hes running away and that wont solve anything. tell him that you beleive in him to do the right thing for his family, for once. and to not be just another deadbeat. that he has the chance to either make or break this family. if you ever wanna tlk my email is: smexyemolover15@yahoo.com <br>  <br>  hope things work out 4 ya|`|pOTigVYPaa	That's too heavy of a burden for you to be carrying around.

It will be hard but there is no other option than to get through it.|`|699ff79ff7efb620adfafa8aea8f3bcaaa	I agree with Shar. This would be a crushing responsibility for you to take. If you can catch your dad where he's receptive to man-to-man talk, remind him how many lives it would ruin if he left. Maybe dad's just spouting off to you so he won't do what he's telling you he will, but remind him that he has five lives in his hands here to destroy and that with so much heartache at stake, he owes it to all of you to man up and give it his best shot at trying to solve the problems. Counseling may well be indicated. Good luck to you all, let us know how it went.

wgZVeLZPaa	I wanted kids for a while, and it never happened. Now that I am divorced I am glad I didn't. I still want kids sometimes, but I change my mind a lot about that. <br>  In regards to your situation, you need to decide what you really want and discuss this with him.

Good-luck.|`|2d890d7e87135b9825c64c3a73ea74c5aa	Well well well...This is something that Scott Bayo went through isnt it? Like his vh1 show 45 and single? I would just talk to him about it. I can tell you the biggest part of what makes me who I am is my son. I knew forever that I wanted to be a mother. I didnt feel complete unless I experienced motherhood ie having my own child. I mean if I couldnt conceive than I would def. want to adopt. I think you can have a great marriage without a child. I will also say that children enhance a relationship. To see the beauty my hubs and I created in our son is a miracle. To have someone call you mommy. Im telling you if you are young this is something you cant undo when your in your 50s. If you feel the baby pains now you will feel them then. The best thing I can say is talk to him about it. If he is adamant about not wanting another child and he cant respect that you desperately want a baby than I think that is a huge rift in your relationship. One will always resent the other for wanting one or preventing the other from having one. I would def. talk it out. 3 years seems like a long time but its not been 15yrs in an unhappy marriage because you want a baby so bad you can taste it. What is ment to be will be if you can have kids or not. But the main issue is if you get married will he do all in his power to procreate with you? If not I would have a huge issue with this because I want a family. Kids to grow old with and enjoy big family holidays. Grandkids...the whole kitten caboodle. No way would I marry someone if I wanted kids and they didnt. Good luck|`|8f03238949ce3a1af22657b15dccfd0aaa	we love our children more than our soul mates. That is a biological fact.  You could lose  a chance to fulfill your biological reason for existence -- and don't take that lightly.  We are genetically programmed to want to reproduce, though not every single person (just like not every single person wants to have sex with a member of the opposite sex.), but these desires can get amazingly strong and you could have some serious regret on your deathbed.<br>  <br>  but then you might regret losing him, too.  Life is full of some very very difficult decisions.  You're in a real pickle.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	Why are you guys not married yet????Being a mother is special. Loving his daughter is special. You really need to have another talk with him. Let him read this or explain your deep feelings about this. A vasectomy is very reversable. ou have alot to consider here. Only you can know what your heart tells you.|`|lvelp0CGaa	Either your confused or I am , your circling round this baby issue , in 1 statement you declare you might have health issues in another you state this might tear you apart .<br>  <br>  Do YOU want a baby ? are you prepared for the sleepless nights ? endless crying due to wind , teething , being uncomfortable ? constant diaper changes , washing baby clothing and nappies , your body becoming out of shape , sore breasts from them growing making milk and being sucked on ? have you thought about if you will breast or bottle feed and the consequence of bottle over breast with your breasts producing milk ? Has any of this crossed your confused mind ?<br>  <br>  He had a vasectomy , he made a choice , even if he were to choose to go for a vasectomy reversal the chances are still slim to none it would succeed not to mention the consequence of reversal can cause irrepairable damage to his groin causing early ejaculation and incapability of even becoming hard in order to have sexual pleasure , he was warned of these effects prior to the vasectomy and signed his John Dough to the permission form . And not to mention the high cost of the vasectomy reversal on top of that , does his insurance even cover it ?<br>  <br>  You can not make him make a choice when you can not even decide what you want your not even 100% you want a baby I think its just because you know how difficult it will be to have 1 that your even thinking this way , did 1 or more of your friends just fall pregnant ? or have babies and you feel that to seal your love the solution is a baby between you to tie you to him for ever ? you stated what if you split in years to come , well what if you do ? so what ? it'll be over and you'll be free of any emotional tie ( the baby ) and you can move on with your life . Yes your way to confused and you need to think now before causing an issue in your relationship that was already clearly there to begin with you wanted him and you didnt care how you got him now you are trying to figure out how to keep him in your life for eternity fix what ever issues are really on hand before bringing a larger issue into it and if your truely not happy and just telling yourself you are then move on .|`|5ajPMlrqaa	I was watching the new TV show "Hopkins" - it's a real-life medical drama set in Johns Hopkins Hospital, and there was a couple dealing with this similar issue. The woman never had kids, but her boyfriend had a child, then a vasectomy. He thought he was finished having kids. Then, years later, he met her, the new "love of his life". She wanted a baby so badly, that he had his vasectomy reversed so they could try to have a baby. It was like his gift to her because he loved her so much.<br>  <br>  That's how I see your situation. Your boyfriend has had a chance to be a dad, but you haven't had a chance to be a mom, and that is a gift that he can give to you, if he wants to. There are things that we do for love that we wouldn't do otherwise. He has had his go around with being a daddy, but you haven't had yours for being a mommy. You may care for, even love, his child, but you aren't a mom. <br>  <br>  So I would say... don't settle for a relationship without a child. He needs to know how important this is to you. If he can't at all imagine having another child, you may have to revise your vision of the future - your life may have to include a different boyfriend in order to make room for the child that you so desperately want.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Wow, very difficult.  I have always known I would have children (although I only have one and she may stay that way for reasons other than being able to concieve- family/financial,ect.)  But I cant imagine not having had her.  And I can only imagine the NEED to have her if my S.O. said he wouldnt.  And then throw in there all the possiblities of getting pregnant/not getting pregnant and all the grey areas.  Very, very difficult. I guess the only thing I can say is this.  If you want children, I dont think this is something you will grow out of - or be ok w/ not having in life when you guys are 10 years in and you realize he is virtually denying you (what I think for those of us who want children) - a primal need.  If you KNOW you want children, that will never change.  In the future your friends, family (?) ect will begin to have their families - that is NOT going to be easy.  Im sorry.  I think its a dealbreaker.  I think you know it too. But the option for him isnt a baby or you... its nothing or you and the family you create together.  Good luck.|`|AA10188961	If you think you can't have a baby, go to your OBGYN and find out.  As you get older, you'll find having a baby is not just a want, but a need.  If you know you want a baby of your own, and he is saying no, there will be resentment.  <br>  You love him, but you can love again.  <br>  If you miss your chance to have a baby, that doesn't come back.  Can you really live with being 60 and not having memories of school plays and soccer games, first loves and graduation?  Will you regret not having grandchildren and big Christmases and every other rites of passage of a family?  <br>  Your boyfriend will get all that.  You will be a part of his family...but you will not have it for yourself and their is a difference.|`|AA11605508	I'm in a similar situation.  Years ago, my fiance had a vasectomy after his three children from a previous marriage were born.  He didn't want any more, and now the procedure is not reversible.  <br>  <br>  I realized that I loved him enough that I was willing to give up biological children so that I could have him around permanently.  That's what I'd advise you to consider - do you love your boyfriend enough that you would give up having biological children? <br>  <br>  You can't control what he wants or decides, only what you want.  If you really want children through childbirth, then you need to consider moving on.
EioOPbzbaa	God how cruel - couldn't he have just stabbed you in the heart?  Unless I am not understanding, your boyfriend offered you an envelope with an empty wrapper so you know he used it and not with you?  What a creep.  Honey you don't need to see anything else.  What a heartless ba****d!|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	I'm sorry I'm not getting your question are you saying your bf handed you an envelop to open did he want you to see the empty condom wrapper or was it a mistake on his part.

You going to worry yourself crazy.

Ep0CAILYaa	Yes it hurts when a female loses her Virginity . Im a female by the way . You have a Hymen Which protects Your Vagina and when you have sex you break it because its not use to being stretched out so much and you bleed not a lot but every female is different.<br>  No boys do not hurt. They have a weird tickle feeling in the penis but to answer your question hope i helped.|`|dP1paFJoaa	i just lost my virginity about a week ago and i can tell you it hurts so much you might even shead a tear or two oh and you might blead to so if youre the fainting type carefull be catious use a condom and ouch its gona hurt but hey it gets better oh and make shure you are ready and are not going to regret it because darlin you dont whant that to happen to you|`|d8e14eb5c12aa575cfd4bf1e19fcf8f2aa	Personally it doesnt really hurt, but you will feel a bit of pressure when the guy first starts, but then it gets easier.

l0xnIquFaa	one of my older brother jeremy (22) isnt really over protective of me, he thinks i can handle myself, and he treats me like im older. <br>  <br>  my second older brother jordan (20) is overprotective! like if i ever swear he gives me a lecture on y im to young to swear, but if a friend of mine (even if there younger than me) swears he doesnt even care! and when i have a bf he always asks me about them, but he doesnt bother the guy or anything like that, he gives me advice on presents and stuff. <br>  <br>  then my little brother who is 12 is overprotective lol. he gave my last boyfriend a lecture about dating me and what he will do if the guy does something bad lol the guy was like 'oook ill b careful' it was funny. but he does annoy me somtimes like if im flirting with a guy somtimes he will come over and pull me away and b all 'this guy isnt for u' and stuff like that which i hate.<br>  <br>  sometimes its good when they are protective. i mean i can name a ton of times when it has helped me. for example (both are for my bro jordan) last week i was at this place with my friends and my older brother was there. one of my guys friends thought it would b hilarious to pants me, so he did, i had my period and everyone saw it was terrible but my older bro covered me up so i could get my pants back up. or another time the same guy who pantsd me thot it would b funny to throw twizzlers down my shirt soon his other friend joined in, my bro got them to knock it off and saved me from embarrassment.<br>  <br>  sometimes it annoying but at leaste you know that they care about you and love you.|`|6PbyKpHzaa	My brother dose not try to get rid of the guys I date in less he thinks they are scum bags.

He sees somethign that you dont see. but dont think of it as being OVER protective, think of it as him looking out for you just the right amount because he loves you and doenst want anything to happen to you. Thats the way I always look at it.|`|Rb3MmzKlaa	Usually it's because older brothers are thinking about when they were the guy's age that you want to date, and remembering what they did and/or wanted to do with whatever girl they wre with.  Now I'm not saying that older brothers are perverted, i'm saying they're protective only because they don't want anything bad to happen to their little sis that they might have seen coming.|`|teZvmrPVaa	since they are older, they feel like they r responsible and they try to be a father figure

M47RNMYAaa	Perhaps she just changed, or maybe she doesn't like the way you're hanging around with people she doesn't like. Either way, I doubt this is your fault. If it was something you'd done, I imagine she would be giving you nasty looks and stuff.<br>  At that age, people tend to be like that. To be honest, people tend to be like that at any age. One minute everything's fine, and then you don't see each other for a while, and the next thing you know they don't want anything to do with you. It just happens.<br>  <br>  If you really miss her, why not try just casually bringing the subject up face to face? However, she doesn't seem very nice if she has just dropped you like this with no explanation, so if I were you, I would just leave it and not worry about it.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)

6JOTtBSGaa	Gee That sucks.. hmm. Have you talked to your friends about this? Summer is a long ways away, you don't want to spend the rest of school being by yourself. Talk to your friends you have right now, if you can, make them listen. Tell them you feel ignored and unwanted, tell them that they need to come out and say it. if they don't like you that much, you'll leave. But that might not be the case, some friends just get calmer after a while. But if it is like this, if they don't want to be your friends, try moving on. You should make new friends. You probably wont find your true best friend now, if you havent already, so you probably wont loose the best friend of your life when you move to texas. But give those people a try, maybe you could hang out with them. Try not to be shy, and just go for it, what do you have to loose anyways?

Well of course, if he got her pregnant after she started menstruating the ugly truth would have been undeniable.  I have read stories about this and even though most of us recognize this as wrong, she was raised this way and was under the misconception that it was ok.  Now that she is in her 20's, she may know it is not normal, but her father convinced her that they had a "different, special relationship that no one would understand."  He probably never allowed her to have a normal relationship with a boyfriend or anyone else in order to keep her isolated; and therefore she hasn't had a chance to develop normal feelings for the opposite sex.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	Highly suspicious.<br>  Sounds like the daughter has a version of Stockholm Syndrome... she's in love with her abuser. <br>  Giving her an STD at an early age is an indicator... and the ex's cock-and-bull story about going to kill her molester... come on, now.<br>  Now you have yet another story coming from the son, and the ex refuses to answer you at all.<br>  <br>  Where have you been during all this time?

Stop being so ridiculously over protective and let your husband enjoy his time with his kids.<br>  <br>  Also, by being so silly about not letting anyone else look after them you are going to ruin your marriage (I'd have already run screaming if I was your husband!) ...all couples need time together away from the kids.<br>  <br>  Lighten up and get some mental help.

I know of people who have been very much addicted to it, & made out fine.  He does have to COMPLETELY quit tho & NO cheating here & there.  It might make him a bit edgy at times, but not to the point of saying the things he does to you.  YES, I can say for a fact that it can be done, that I KNOW.  This should not make him love you one minute & not be able to stand you another minute.  It doesn't get that bad.  Sounds like he's having "other" problems w/this pot situation.  Seriously, his addiction to drugs is like any other drug.  When you quit drinking, you stop completely, & that I can truly say from my own experience.  IF you keep "feeding" the addiction, you have no hopes of overcoming it because you're still keeping it in your system.  He's GOT to quit completely.  IF I could stop drinking for 18 yrs., drank for 40 yrs., I can say I'm surely talking from experience.  A drug is a drug is a drug!!  I DO wish you ALL the best...:)

ropZvmRDaa	My mother had this same problem, here is what she did. She came up to us and asked us how we felt about it, all though she had her little boy who was only 3 at that time she asked him in a different way because she wanted to move from IN to KY. So this is what she said to him, "Dylan, can I talk to you?" Because he was doing something then when he came over to her she said it in a way that he would understand it since he was only 3... So she said "Dylan would you like to move to Kentucky so then we can have a better life for mommy" and then since he was only 3 he said sure, but then when she came across us for our answers we of course said yes also, because she told us how she did not like the community around us (She had the same problem with family and etc.)<br>  <br>  And then about the friends stuff, here is a fantastic way to make some fast nice friends! Even if you don't have a religion because we didn't have one when we moved but my mother thought that it would be a great way to make friends. So what she did was took us "Church Hunting" We made some great friends in about two weeks! It was awesome! Oh and also, try to find a church that has a daycare, usually it is ones that have a school with them. Most of them that have a school will have a daycare for all ages up to about four or five, they should have a daycare for when their is church, and a daycare for whenever they are having school that day.<br>  <br>  My advice is since they are so young, your best bet is to move them now while they are young!<br>  <br>  Goodluck with everything.  :)<br>  Hope I will be your best answer.|`|YTYrg3qlaa	you should move, they can be w their fathers on weekends, and if you'r happy they will be happy too. im sure you guys are going to find some friends :)|`|5488d65a5a874c153dc0083bb5fcb518aa	just move; you'll be better off & your kids will understand; good luck :)|`|B95ksbHDaa	Imagine your boyfriend doesn't exist.

They have friends now, and they have a life.  You shouldn't make them give that up in search of a life you want but might not necessarily have for all too long.<br>  <br>  But if you have other reasons, besides him, to make you go...go.

So lets take a look at this logically. there are 2 situations. the situation where you stay in that dump, and the situation where you move to washington. Every situation has different outcomes. <br>  <br>  In the first situation you will stay home the diffrent outcomes are (I am on purposly taking the utmost extremes): <br>  <br>  You will become depressed and wondered what it would be like if you went to washington for the rest of your life and regret that you didn't.<br>  <br>  Your daughters will become happy yet you stay a lil depressed and probably lonely because you hate the man that is constantly in your house seeing your daughter.<br>  <br>  situation two you go to washington to your boyfriend:<br>  <br>  You break up with your boyfriend again only this time he is fed up and hates you for the rest of his life. (Yes it's very clear that you broke up with him because he is truly in love with you if he still wants to be with you after all you did to him.) You are in washington with 2 daughters and no income and you'll have to work a crappy job for the rest of your life, yet your daughters will be happy because they will surely make new friends there and you wont have to see the smug face of your first daughters father.<br>  <br>  You and your boyfriend become happily ever after. You finish school and have a good education and get a good job. You and your boyfriend get married get a nice house live a little outside of washington where you'll have a dog running around the house playing with your children. Your children will become happy and you'll be happy and your bf will be happy.<br>  <br>  Is the worst case scenario really worth taking the trip to washington?<br>  Think about it.|`|NZ4iWM9maa	Best bet, move to another town in driving distance of the family. From the sound of it you have rotten luck picking men and you think this new bf will support you in WA. If I'm wrong in that and you can be finacially stable in WA with out the dude, then go for it now while your kids are still young.

seU9VwIJaa	Wear a bra closest to the one you will be wearing on your wedding day. They may even stick you in one that suits the dress. When I was trying on some dresses, I couldn't wear one at all! <br>  Do bring pictures of dresses you like, but don't be afraid to try on one that you think you will hate! Those always surprise people. Let them know what your tastes are and feel free to voice your opinion if you hate a dress. They're there to find your dream dress!<br>  They won't go into the room with you unless you request their help. I'd bring someone that you're close to just to help you wiggle into dresses and lace you into it. It's a lot better than having a stranger see you half naked and stuck in a dress!<br>  Congrats and good luck!!!|`|8a8CZqGLaa	I would wear a strapless beige bra, and beige underwear, but other than that I think you're ok. Maybe wear the undergarments you're planning on wearing at your wedding if you have them already.|`|1KfbgBupaa	I would recommend you wear a normal strapless bra and nice panties, plus street clothes that are easy to get in and out of.  Also take something to pin your hair up with.  You can take pics of dresses or describe the dresses to the clerks but you should also try on different styles - you might be surprised at the dress you end up with or at the style that is most flattering to you.  After you have decided on the dress, you need to have all the fittings done with the correct bra on as that will make a difference in how the dress fits, as well as wear the shoes you'll wear for the ceremony - this affects the length of the dress, as does petticoats, etc.  The clerks will stay in the room to help you with the dresses or if you request they not, your mom or whomever can help you with the dresses.|`|hKss8M9Raa	Here's what happened when I went to David's Bridal to get a dress. As far as sizes go, don't freak out if you end up with a bigger number than you thought because wedding dresses run small. For example, if you normally wear a 6 in regular clothes, they will probably have you try on 8's. After one or two dresses they should easily be able to get you in the right size. Most dresses have to be altered anyways. Do take pictures. That is perfectly acceptable, even if they don't carry that brand in their store. I took a scrap book of pictures I had collected over the years and ended up with a dress that was in the book. Also, at DB they give you a magizine of their current styles for you to look through and pick out to try on. Next, they shouldn't be in the room when you try anything on. They will be bringing dresses in and out but not while you are changing. They may have to help you zip or lace things up though as some can be tricky. If you are worried about having them fuss too much over you, try to schedule your appointment at a busier time, like Saturday morning or afternoon. If you want more personal attention, try to go on a weekday morning. As far as undergarments go, they gave me a strapless bra/corset to use while I tried on the dresses. You don't have to buy it (it's expensive) but they will probably try to sell it to you. I just went and got a strapless bra from the mall. You will probably need to get one as most styles right now look best with them, but you don't have to get it until you know that's what you will need and then you can bring it back to your fitting. One last thing: expect a little sticker shock. Wedding dresses are pretty expensive and the alterations add up even more. I blew my $500 budget by $200 after all the alterations but I really love my dress. I just saved some more in other places so I didn't blow my budget over all.|`|aipChC3haa	I think that you should bring a push up bra, and strap less bra.  For underwear, one that is black and another that is white|`|ss5vAWKSaa	A bra and panties should be sufficient.|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	no worries! wedding gowns fit small so don't get all freaked out about that.  also i thought i would hate the process of choosing a gown - i hate shopping for clothes - hate wearing dresses - but i absolutely loved wedding gown shopping - even thought it took weeks to find 'my' dress it was great fun!  <br>  take the foundation garments you are going to wear on your wedding day, as well as the shoes you are going to wear on your wedding day.  if you know how you are going to wear you hair on your big day it wouldn't hurt to do your hair in  that style - that way you can see how the hair and gown work together!  <br>  btw this is going to sound daft but wear white undergarments - we were in a bridal shop once and the bride had on pink polka dot panties - and even though the gown had several layers of skirt you could see her undies - everyone, including the b.t.b. had a good laugh about it!  it doesn't really matter other than you want to focus on the gown not be giggling about your undies showing through!<br>  good luck <br>  [some shops don't allow photos to be taken]|`|O1MITmaGaa	I haven't gone through marriage, but hopefully this advice is useful<br>  <br>  #1 you NEED to try on a wedding dress. It's ALL about the fit, like all fashion, and wearing comfortable and appropriate undergarments is key.<br>  <br>  #2 so what is your dress like? if it's strapless, or has thin straps wear a strapless bra, or else the sports bra will show. remember to keep the colours either white or skin-color, or something that won't show under the dress.<br>  <br>  #3 it'd also be very helpful if you showed pictures of the type of dress you want, yes, but also keep in mind that it doesn't hurt to try on other dresses, because maybe you'll realize your dream dress isn't what you imagined and that you've found a better surprise dress!<br>  <br>  #4 btw, no, they probably won't be in the room with you. they might help you adjust the dress once it's on, but they won't be there when you change, I'm quite sure.<br>  <br>  #5 - I just thought of something! they're probably going to measure you, like waist, bust, hips, etc., so you might want to remember that they might need you to wear something thinner and closer to the skin (tighter) - keep that in consideration.<br>  <br>  good luck! congrats on the wedding!|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Wear nice undies, like good ones, not a gstring as the wedding dress fitters will be fitting it on you.<br>  Also you prob wont be wearing a bra when they go to fit it on you, id say wear a nice strapless bra but you may have to take it off anyway.<br>  AND MINIMAL MAKEUP!!!! people get really frustrated if you wear a heap of makeup and stain the dress.<br>  <br>  I knew a girl who wore a heap of makeup all the time and was told by the exclusive shop that she would either have to wipe all her makeup off or shop somewhere else.<br>  <br>  But yea nice comfy undies and a nice strapless bra.<br>  <br>  its uncomfortable but usually they dont look when you are getting undressed and are fitting it on your bust etc, tehy usually just come in once the dress is on and they will help you put it on properly and zip it up or tie the backs up.<br>  Dont wear the sports bra because you will have to take it off anyway, you will feel better in a strapless that you may not have to take off.<br>  <br>  Goodluck and its a piece of cake!!<br>  Even if you tell the people you are getting to help you fit it, just say look i really dont feel comfortable with you being in here whilst i try it on can you wait outside while i put it on and i will call you when i am ready, usually they are fine with this, (You are spending alot of money on a dress)<br>  <br>  Also take a friend with you, its always easier.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Don't wear a thong.  ;-)<br>  <br>  Bridal shops will have undergarments (usually a long lined strapless bra) and petticoats for you to wear when you try on the dresses.<br>  <br>  They will not stay in the room with you while you put the undergarments on.  They will tell you to let them know when you're ready to put the dress on.  They will come in to help you.  Many dresses take two people to get into.  If you're trying on dresses that you can get into yourself, they will just come in and zip you up so you can go out to the mirrors and see how you look.<br>  <br>  I know you have an idea of what you're looking for, but if the sales lady suggests a dress, try it.  The people at the better stores have fitted scores of brides and know what styles look good on what body types.  They want you to look and feel beautiful on your wedding day, so give them a chance to help you find something if your ideas don't pan out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck with your shopping!|`|CaPZrWVWaa	wear a bra similar to what you might be wearing on the date. but then again it depends is your dress strapless?  <br>  <br>  do you think you will wear a 'corset/girtle' on your wedding day?<br>  <br>  wear the type of underwear you will be wearing to make sure that it fits and looks ok.

Maybe even eventually you will be able to do something extra for them,(ie:tutoring, swimming lessons, music lessons, or summer camp).  All things that they deserve.<br>  Good Luck.|`|FEhmNTL2aa	Just keep the 100 bucks, but yes you need to tell him. At least he's trying. I don't know the whole story with you guys so I won't judge either party, but yes tell him, that's the right thing to do.|`|diAqosiIaa	yes|`|xjXwsBRwaa	Ask yourself these questions 1) did he have an attorney when child support was established 2) can he read for himself 3) was he present in court when the child support was finalized....if you can answer yes to any (OR NONE AT ALL) I would say HELL NO!|`|KSK22vHUaa	Well, telling him would be the right thing to do if you feel merciful.  But being that far behind on child support, he owes you much more than just 5500, so I would probably not tell him.  But I'm kind of mean :p|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	Create good will.

There is no value in making him pay twice.<br>  <br>  Help preserve the relationship with his children.|`|IvMPh09baa	are you serious?<br>  <br>  you sound like a money grubbing sob... he paid you!

nwNkXEO3aa	There are 5 different love languages.<br>  1) Words of Affirmation<br>  2) Quality Time<br>  3) Acts of Services<br>  4) Physical Tough<br>  5) Giving of Gifts<br>  <br>  (1) Words of Affirmation is whereby you say things like "I love you", "You look handsome/pretty"<br>  <br>  (2) Quality time is whereby you spend time which produces a lot of positive results. Like, spending time together to have quality conversation. Note that quality is NOT quantity. But rather, with quantity comes quality.<br>  <br>  (3) Acts of Services is whereby you serve her. In what areas? In any areas. From serving her with food, to doing the household chores to driving her everywhere to whatever that you're doing which is serving her.<br>  <br>  (4) Physical touch is things like holding hands, kissing, hugging etc. Sexual intercourse is a physical touch, but apparently, a person can't have sexual intercourse with his/her friends. But in the context of married couples, it's okay to have sexual intercourse.<br>  <br>  (5) Giving of Gifts. As it says, giving simple gifts or expensive gifts, that person will feel love.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Every one have their primary love language and secondary love language. In other words, their top 2 love languages. It means that if a person shows his/her love through those 2 love languages, it feels the best for them. It will make them feel loved. For example, if your wife's love language is words of affirmation, then shower her with love by saying how much you love her etc.<br>  <br>  Of course, some love languages, it may be hard for you to show, but you gotta do it if you want the relationship to go on. Go find out what your wife's love language is. I believe you can do it! All the best for the relationship between you and your wife. =)|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Well, if you're married, I should assume that you should be able to just tell her. It sounds like it could have been an arranged marriage.  But they work for some reason or another.  It was bound to happen.  Just tell her next time you tell her goodnight.  Just don't make a thing of it.  It will be much less awkward that way.  Just "Goodnight...I love you." Just don't anticipate a response immediately.|`|Avbh2QEeaa	why would it be awkward? SHE'S UR WIFE!! take her out to dinner and treat her to a romantic night out.  If you're not the "romantic type of guy" then just tell her EXACTLY how you feel.   Trust me, it won't be awkward. Girls ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT when guys are honest about their feelings :) good luck|`|7aoHmM4baa	a dimond ring + nice dinner + good sex with downtown massage included  *wink|`|rK9lDXnCaa	I have been married for thirtyfive years and have secretly been waiting all that time for my husband to say "I love you!"I know how hard it is for men to actually SAY the words, BUT MOST WIVES would just LOVE to hear them! Just look at her, say "I love you,"and go from there. She will probably be a wee bit, "OK, what have YOU done or what have YOU been drinking?" but if you are sincere and she knows you, she will more likely cry and feel her heart overflow! Go for it you wonderful man and I wish you both the best!|`|NwVwZ8Tjaa	If it took you five years to develop feelings for her why don't you just say it already.She has waited long enough.  Have a night in with chinese food, some Luther and after massaging her from head to toe, tell her.|`|m7xoRoMLaa	how would that be akward if you love her?<br>  just say: "baby i love you, you know that right?'<br>  something cute, like that.|`|fwUfEMvRaa	How about:  "Honey, I didn't love you when I married you, but I sure do love you now."  How's that?|`|Bsf4cNjmaa	you honey i Reilly love you|`|5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	You mean to say when you married her you didnt have any feelings for her? Why did you get married like that in the first place? <br>  5 years is a long time - she may feel the same about you so just give her a kiss and tell her already!!!|`|IvMPh09baa	uh... i am guessing this was an arranged marriage.
ropZvmRDaa	If you have asked her to leave you alone and she still doesn't then you can charge her for harrasment.<br>  <br>  Then if she is 25 and still lives with her parents and doesn't have any of those things have you considered that she might be Mentally Challenged?<br>  <br>  Hun you should always make sure of the problem first.<br>  Try to find out if she is Mentally Disabled first.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|xUNmNk6paa	wow, stalker, you have to call the police.|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	just be honest with her.|`|8akkqCpWaa	wow... thats pretty wierd introduce her toy our friends and maybe she will find other friends to hang out with|`|Qa1DoqdJaa	Well if you actually told her to leave you alone and she still doesn't listen you may want to get a restraining order. I mean leave me alone is pretty blunt. Now if you just hinted around about it then maybe she didn't get the message. You may just need to be up front with her and tell you that you need your space and some alone time for a while. Or try introducing her to a new friend for her to stalk.|`|o6uA49Tqaa	shes a STALKER....<br>  just tell her how you feel strongly|`|esjgb0FDaa	ok a week is too soon. i have done that with a good friend after 1.5 years.<br>  my friend did walk out. but, no i was not a stalker. just too attached and wanted to feel special to someone. ofcourse, i feel ashamed but we all do things that are wrong and realize later.<br>  <br>  its easy to judge her. but, maybe she has some issues. i know knowing her only for a week, you are not at all obligated to help her through her issues.<br>  distance yourself or ask your other friend what to do with this chick. but at the same time walk out realizing not to judge her or make fun. you may find yourself lonely and dying for attention some day.you do not have to get a restraining order and such crap. worst case talk to her parents.|`|tmckNa4baa	Well, try to let her down gently, tell her I cant hang out with u all the time.

I just always told my mom how much I hated him but it always turned out into a big argument. I used to hate wen ppl told me this but since he is doing all of that for your mom, at least you know he really likes her, and I'd rather have a guy that cares too much than someone that doesn't care at all or someone who is abusive, and at least you know your mom is happy. So just do what I did, ignore him, and just wait.... maybe they'll break up like my mom did.|`|AA10819251	dude i know how you feel my step mom is a doucher and my dads real pussy whiped to so i know how you feel and nah but try to think of a plan to get them broke up or sumthin sorry i cant really help bro but i know how you feel it blows harder then a hoe LOL|`|bGCscBlbaa	tell him not to be a fag. lol|`|5WQXVwbDaa	Hey guy, =0) you're pretty cute! but either than that I used to be in that situation and I was a total ***** to my moms boyfriends.

She gets along with this guy and it sounds like he treats her well. Would you rather her be with a abusive asshole? Be respectful to him for your mom. Or just do your own thing. Dont be a dick. My dad is alone now and it makes me sad to see him lonely.

My mom's loser a** douchebag boyfriend recently cheated on her with another woman for a month (the same month that was the one year anniversary might I add of her mother's death...so it was already a crap month for her...oh and it was Christmas and he ditched all her family get togethers and what not) and the woman called my mother to tell her. When my mom confronted him he first denied it and then turned around and BLAMED her. He was a loser to begin with, can't be bothered to keep a job, he is a bum who mooches all her money (that she doesn't have enough of in the first place), he too makes lame jokes that only he thinks are funny, he rambles on and on and on about his bike trips and he is just an all around dumbass. Trust me I am wishing he takes a hike soon too. My mother deserves better. <br>  So look on the bright side of things...your mom could be dating my mom's loser boyfriend (and HEY! who knows, maybe she is too! He is a lying sack of crap cheater!)|`|OT6ybbhtaa	Haha, well she shouldn't use him like that... even if he's willing...<br>  <br>  And he dousn't sound like much of a douche bag if you ask me. Who the f*ck really cares about what car he drives? I don't know any girls that do care about stuff like that. And he sounds like a gentleman... the only reason you should have for not liking him doing that, is if it bugs her... but I think theres ALOT of women who would consider all that stuff he's doing to be really sweet and cool. <br>  And, I hate to break it to ya buddy... but its not up to you who you're mom goes out with. Just like its not up to her, to chose for you. You can tell her your oppinion... but keep it as your oppinion. Don't try to tell her what to do.

pTkjGfBRaa	Some say it's love, but researcher John Gottman from the University of Washington says otherwise.  Based on research with thousands of couples, he can predict divorce with 90% accuracy.<br>  <br>  The most important indicator for success or failure of a marriage is how a couple resolves its conflicts. <br>  <br>  For successful romantic relationships, there are generally three styles: conferencing, conflict avoidant, and volatile.<br>  <br>  It sounds like your conflict resolution style is definitely volatile.  While volatile relationships can work and are often marked by what seems to be a greater level of passion and motion, they also frequently skirt break-up.  They are roller coaster relationships, and sometimes the roller coasters crash.<br>  <br>  From what you write, it does not sound like your relationship is leaning towards a successful volatile relationship, but rather one that's likely to crash.  While your conflicts are volatile, it doesn't sound like you're solving your issues, your problems.  They're still there.  <br>  <br>  Furthermore, the object of your love is throwing up huge warning signs that flag him as someone more likely than others to become physically violent towards you in the future.  While he may not, his behavior makes this outcome more likely.  His acting out physically in ways that cause him pain makes him more likely to physically act out in ways that cause YOU pain in the future.<br>  <br>  Beware.  While it may be hard to leave an abusive man before marriage, it will certainly be exponentially harder to leave an abusive man who you love after marriage.  Beware, you may be falling into a dangerous trap.  <br>  <br>  If nothing else, seek professional counseling sooner rather than later, either for you or as a couple.  Marriage won't solve your problems.  If there is unresolved conflict, it will only amplify this conflict.  In the process, you may be seriously physically and emotionally harmed if not worse.<br>  <br>  The man with whom you are in a relationship seems to be increasing in his need to control every aspect of your life.  This is a VERY BAD sign.  This is likely to get even worse, not better.  As someone who has been in a relationship with someone insecure enough to seek the types of control you mention, my experience is that the behavior gets progressively worse, and not better.  I wish people had told me I needed to get out earlier, because I was blinded by love and wasn't seeing clearly.  In retrospect, I ignored countless warning signs.  You have taken a great first step and asked for help.  Take action now before it's too late!<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless you.|`|8SoDRERzaa	asking you what you're doing and with whom constantly is a sign of a controlling man...most controlling men become abusive<br>  <br>  it starts with "little" things like him only punching the wall...then you become the wall|`|fwUfEMvRaa	He has issues that you can't help him with.  He needs to deal with his anger and attitude on his own.  Think about getting out of the relationship before someone gets hurt.  Yes, it is possible.  You aren't over reacting.|`|hb94oOSeaa	Yes I do think there is a possibility that he can become physically abusive and frankly he sounds verbally abusive already.<br>  I wouldn't marry him.|`|WmcU01D7aa	Yes. He probably will become physically abusive if he does not seek help for his anger problems.|`|ZqXUduJMaa	If you even need to ask the question, the answer is YES!<br>  <br>  It's obvious that he has a violent temper, and it might only be a matter of time before he starts hitting you instead of the wall.<br>  <br>  Many abusers start out fabulous - kind attentive and loving. Then as time goes on, their true colors come out. After the "fight", they are sweet and apologetic - until the next time.<br>  <br>  Try running a check on his police record to see if there are any violent entries. Keep an eye open for any controlling behavior, like separating you from your family or friends, or checking up on your whereabouts.<br>  <br>  But, most of all, listen to your heart...|`|xjXwsBRwaa	His behaviors are escalating...you both need counseling for his escalating behaviors and if he refuses that's your answer to move on, because his next step isn't to hit the wall or bedpost, but YOU! It also sounds like he's trying to control you by not letting you speak your opinion and the next step to that is him isolating you from your family and friends...its called the domestic violence cycle...|`|PoHpSqwwaa	Watch out lady . After my ma married my dad he stopped giving her presents and started drinking and treating her like crap , so  what your bf  is showing are bad signs. I wouldn't marry him if i were you..You don't wanna ruin your life / waste it|`|AQwoCjj3aa	You need to talk to him about it, you need to tell him how you feel, and if he is not willing to change, well, then you should not be with a person that is big headed and constantly putting you down, unless you are ok with it.  It might take time for him to change, or there is a chance he could become physically abusive, he is already emotional abusive, so it really is up to you, but I think the best route is communication.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	Well, anyone can be abusive.<br>  <br>  And, would you rather him punch a post, or you?<br>  That's probably his way of getting anger out.<br>  <br>  But if you don't want to marry him then don't, it will only lead to divorce, which is worse.|`|NS3BxXEmaa	IDK but u better protect yourself when u can he might go crazy on you but then he might turn to mr.Rogers|`|WyxxDgSeaa	I think you probably already know the answer to your question. Domination is a big part of an abusive relationship and it sounds like he's well on his way to that. It shows in his having to be right and not letting you speak during arguments Intimidation is also part of it and that's reflected in his hitting things, which is frightening in itself and meant to intimidate you. (See how mad you make me.) His checking up on you and expecting you to report to him is also telling. He's not worried about you, he's controlling you. The same goes for his criticism of your friends...think of it as isolating you, because he is. Counseling may be worthwhile if you're both receptive to it. It's possible that he's feeling anger in another area, like work, and lets it explode with you. Don't make excuses for him. Insist that you both deal with this or leave. Get informed and be careful!|`|jYMlAN4Paa	OK...this is getting scary. You need to get away from him. I don't know what is up with him or what happened with him. He may have started out as a great guy but he's not turning out that way. In this case, it doesn't matter what your heart tells you....it's your safety that you need to worry about. He needs to get help so that he doesn't hurt anyone. You need to let him go and start over again someplace else. I really fear for you.
Zxtiewnyaa	don't worry when it becomes your time you will get them, ya maybe alot of your friends have boobs, but have they ever wonder that when they get older and they will get old we all do. things that are nice and firm can become saggy in time.I know people who are in their 40's that are flat-chested it doesn't make them any less of a woman.think  about it when you have a boyfriend you'll know he's not going out with you cuz you have a big chest, he going out with you because of who you are inside.How you carry yourself. Alot of girls use what they have to get a guy, what they don't realize is that they are just giving themselves a name.By flashing themselves around the school or anywhere else for that matter is only disgrading themselves. Tell them that your happy with the way you are (and you should be, because your a beautiful person.) And if you find that the boys are not paying any attention to ya, screw them too, News Flash!!!! there are alot of guys out here in this world that does not like the big boob girls they prefer the small boobs. the ones who are in that club, you know. The Ity, bitty, titty commitee.I'm a woman in that club, and my husband finds nothing wrong with me, he loves me for who I am, not what I have or don't have. He loves me. I've been married for 28 years and counting.|`|CAf3ooH2aa	Trust me, after high school, it won't even matter. But if you need something to say, this is the best I could think of:<br>  "At least I won't have back problems when I get older." or "If that's the only reason a guy likes me, I don't want him."<br>  Love yourself and every one else will follow.|`|gyBtDSiUaa	aww, thats really sad:(<br>  <br>  well, if i was in your postion, i would walk away when they say it. Good friends dont pay out other friends differences.<br>  <br>  I honestly dont know why boob sizes matter.<br>  <br>  They will get over it or if not there selfs, dont worry about them, cheer up and live life:)<br>  xx|`|7FCp1CMvaa	You'll grow eventually. If they are being so mean to you, I think they aren't really your friends. <br>  <br>  And if their reasons are like you've stated, then it's sad. That's just too shallow. <br>  <br>  A girl should want a guy, who likes her for other reaons, not because of her breast size.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	okay girls have faced this problem for a million years..... okay maybe not that long but you know what I mean<br>  <br>  I am a woman and a mother of  two teenage girls 17 and 15  one is  a senior and big chested the other is a sophmore and a solid B cup and I have a C cup .<br>  <br>  but you know what I never had boobs until I had kids I was maybe almost a B cup if I was lucky... I played sports did cheering and softball. <br>  <br>  when the girls I went to school with talked about how boys would like then for there boobs I used to think how stupid that was because if a boy only likes you for your boobs he is not a boy worth liking but one who probably only wants to have sex with you. A real guy a decent guy will love you for exactly who you are and most boys will ttell you boob size really does not matter<br>  <br>  My daughter who is a senior had girls in her class last year who went through this phase where they were wearing 2 or 3 bras lol to make themselves look bigger she used to come home and tell me about home they did that and you could tell because they had humps on back from the 3 bra straps lol<br>  <br>  Next time your friends say something about your chest simply reply while laughing, well mine may be smaller now but just think when I am forty they will still be perky enough to wear a tank top braless while yours will be at your knees and laugh and walk away. they will get the point they are not bothering you and move on to a new topic.<br>  <br>  I know teen years can be awkward and challenging but God made you just the way you are and you are perfect you do not need to be anything  or anyone but you and it i s okay to love yourself as you are.|`|xQn3rR6Naa	If you want to upset them say"and when you are having to wear old lady clothes I'll be wearing that cute designer dress" If you just want them to stop, then say, "it hurts me when you are constantly discussing my body like it is your problem. I don't discuss your problems with anyone and if you value my friendship you won't discuss mine. "
f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	Take the egg-beater out of your ear and chill for a while.|`|tHhD9wtDaa	let go
Q5dQZXiUaa	Yeah, especially when you have to use the bathroom, it feels awkward when you drop a bomb in a person' s place cause you feel embarrassed about it.|`|manL9Xcwaa	sometimes, yes. and yeah i always use to feel awkword the first few times i went to my "crushes" house and well i still do because his family is rude.<br>  but just try to be friendly to there family and don't think so much about being there for the first time. just think of it as hanging out with a friend.|`|1Q5OU6Pcaa	With family i dont<br>  <br>  but when I step into a non family members house I dont sit down or anything until they tell me please sit down or i dont even step into there house till they say please come in or something like that<br>  <br>  i feel uncomfortable in non family members house|`|OLJekQVwaa	Yea it's totally normal! But you eventually loosen up a little! But just remember, when you get comfortable enough at someones house you have to remember that there are still some boundaries that need to be shown!|`|Zd91le3gaa	sometimes i do..i guess its just like your getting to know that person that much more and that family more..|`|D6Xfc5Wtaa	Yes I do. But I am shy even at my own house, so that might not mean much.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	yeah its awkward the first time|`|QyxLVNCWaa	No. But I behave.|`|QJu7IO0Waa	Yes. It is a new situation where you have not yet gained enough knowledge to deem what actions are appropriate or not. I feel this is perfectly natural.|`|taEM0EgDaa	sorta|`|Rf2r23sYaa	Yes.|`|mYAbq6fnaa	of course. i think everyone does. i guess that its just the idea of being in a new enviroment and new surroundings. we havent been there before, so it is unfamiliar and more uncomfortable than another place you've been before would be.|`|kGYL8a4Yaa	Yeah, especially when their houses show how much "better off" they are than me. LMAOO.|`|eTS2nd70aa	Hell yeah. I feel like it's rude for me to sit down, to take my coat off, to take my shoes off...very awkward.|`|sLgI3cRpaa	somewhat but i stay natural and calm
52otNiElaa	You should of thought of that before you got with him.|`|ff27c578abd6f97b50c76f87e94ae774aa	Guys can say things and not mean them...he told you he won't cheat on you because he knew that's what you wanted to hear. Don't let yourself get to close or emotionally attached to him. Don't have sex with him for sure...he'll just end up breaking your heart. If he does one thing to hurt you or make you not trust him, leave him. You deserve better. Give him a chance, but don't expect much from him. It's hard when you really like someone, but you will come out the better person in the end. Don't let him break your heart...give him a chance, but if he hurts you, break HIS heart! :)|`|VjmTK6uZaa	Once a cheater always a cheater.  He probably said the exact same thing to the other girls that he told you tonight.  It's how they operate.  They try to get girls to trust them, then the girl will let them do whatever they want.  Even go out with other girls.  I'm not saying people can't change, but he really didn't have a reason to change or nothing happened in his life to make him change.  So he probably didn't.  I recommend just watching him very carefully, he won't cheat once you first go out but in a month or so he will start trying.  I recommend to listen to anything your friends say, but tell your friends your going to give him a chance.  If he ruins it, you need to leave him.  Simple as that.  Good luck|`|qRKOWgS0aa	If you want to risk Getting hurt. Go for it.<br>  A leopard never changes its spots. Once a cheater- Always a cheater.<br>  guess he told the other girls exactly the same.BEWARE.|`|G50ucmllaa	You just started dating him and already are questioning if he is faithful...Why are you dating him?  I am sure he told ever other girl the same thing.|`|S96JEBquaa	just give him a chance and see how it goes and if u think something is up end it|`|xHcQSLiVaa	Find a new boyfriend.|`|8FbOtXAXaa	I hate to see other girls get their hearts broken so I am going to have to say he is probably bad news. Of course he is going to tell you that he won't cheat on you, he is just telling you what you want to hear. True, people can change but they have to do it for themselves and you cannot change him. I would say don't do it. Don't let yourself get hurt.|`|66a8c3a4a248bc136235d706087bf722aa	Judge by his actions not his words. Does he seem to be a reliable and honest guy? If he basically does what he promises or says, then give him the benefit of doubt. Also, see how he acts around other girls. Is he still flirting, or calling other girls? Does he introduce you as his girlfriend to his friends and girl buddies? <br>  <br>  Its always wise to check into what people say. They may just want to sabotage you so check your sources and make sure they are reliable before you go and dump the guy.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|HjJknB8Iaa	Doesn't sound like a good idea to stay with him.<br>  But then again, I might be wrong.<br>  <br>  How long have you known this guy?<br>  <br>  You should wait until you guys have become good friends before you decide to date him because:<br>  1. you'll know more about him<br>  2. you'll understand how he treats you/other girls<br>  <br>  It's really up to you if you want to give him a chance; you could be right and he could change. <br>  Hopefully it'll work out for you.|`|SPh4ctPCaa	True love can never be cheating on. But yeah I would say give him one change because my dad dated 8 GF in the past before he met my mom and there age is sort of a big gap I'm guessing. But yeah give him one chance and make sure that you do NOT have sex with him. You are better off saving for someone who you are going to be with the rest of your life. That's what I'm doing.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	your so gullible. he's gonna cheat on you. he has a pattern of behavior to cheat. and this pattern continued Before you, will continue With you, and will continue After you. when your heartbroken 5 months from now you can't say "No one Warned Me".|`|01R9gh3Vaa	I'd be suspicious!!  If he cheated once, he's going to cheat again!!  And you can't change the guy!|`|xWD4XG7Naa	please don't think u are THAT GIRL who will change him. he is still young and therfore he will prob take years before he changes into a better person, follow ur gut tho.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I would say if the cheating happened within 1 year, there is a high probability it will happen again.  Especially if he is young.<br>  <br>  If he cheated on girls, say in high school, and now he is 30, then I would say he might be ok to be given a chance.<br>  <br>  As a rule: Actions speak louder than words and he has demonstrated by his past actions where his morals lie.|`|6TcRi70Yaa	If you know some of the people enough to ask about him, you should ask how he cheated on them. Also, ask if he told them the same things he is telling you about not cheating.<br>  <br>   People can change but it doesn't mean he has. Find out some more about him from OTHER people before decided how much you want to trust him.|`|OMrSVM98aa	Yes, people can change but you will have to see, give him one chance, if hes going soemwhere girls should only go that means soemthings up and he could be cheating and if he does,he goes somewhere that girls only go dont just go u cheated! follow him not stalk... and see wheres he goin.. ,aybe that'll help! Lighten up!|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	Sure give him a chance but if he decides to cheat on you, leave him right away. Don't get hurt over someone that has bad "references". Take it easy and don't get emotions into this relationship right away. <br>  Don't have sexual contact with him other than kissing until you are sure that is not the only thing he is looking for in you!|`|Goxj1meyaa	i think since you already said yes you gave him a second chance. if you like him you should stay with him, but if you have any reason to not believe him you should confront him... and if he asks why you would think that you always have the excuse of saying, "hey its not like you didnt cheat before..."|`|AA10701265	once a cheater always a cheater think befor you get to serious, if he second looks at any girls or if you find that he talks to random grlz then no dont even chance it, all guys say that when they find a new grl but then your just another n the game|`|HaDR9veDaa	not to be rude but what makes u so special? how ru different from the other girls that trusted him and he ended up cheating on. if u r already questioning IF he is going to cheat this early then is it really worth it????|`|fgvBhOL1aa	Well a relationship need trust, but you should never let your guard down. People can change but they can't change that fast|`|RbBbNh0Maa	Give him a chance, but don't get too close to him until he earns your trust|`|2QS8j9aOaa	Once a cheat always a cheat they say.|`|QmvJyUfIaa	Maybe one chance but if he breaks it don't give him antoher|`|EsRuOno1aa	No way...don't trust him. I'm sure he's told previous girlfriend the exact same things that hes telling you.|`|WvBgXv5daa	think hes probably changed stay close if hes not around you alot then break it off okay>?<|`|mRWAn2vHaa	Don't waist your time move on!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|osusVJk0aa	break his heart to see where his head really is|`|du5MNrQ6aa	what are you in middle school? how did he cheat? did he look at another girl? grow up.|`|2545a1a8d5f0a0f14de8e407f7c80f7caa	yea people can defiantly change. Maybe you are the one he really wants to be serious with, maybe he realized what he has done in the past and wants to change. Buttt, on the other hand, he has done it before and very small percentages change, so I definitely would tell you if he tried you or cheats on you, or starts gettin fishy call it off, cuz if you forgive him and it keeps happens, he knows he'll be able to cheat on you anytime he wants cuz your always gonna forgive him, he'll walk all over you. You can try it, but if it was me and i knew that the girl is a known cheater, I wouldnt be near her|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	i say to give him a chance... but past behavior is a predictor of future behavior... so be careful! don't be so nosey and like go through his phone and texts... or ask him where he is every minute... <br>  <br>  just don't do anything with him either yet, until you can fully trust him... and what other people say about your relationship with him shouldn't really matter eventually. it's different now because you two just started dating, but after a while you will begin to see the real him... but like i said i wouldn't do anything with him, if you were planning on it, until you can fully trust him. <br>  <br>  just be careful, people can change, and you never know you may be the girl that he will change for.|`|rcy9sPV3aa	try giving him a chance - but be prepared that he might cheat on you because he did on other girls. i think you're really young so don't take things too seriously, its not like you're going to marry him. at this age its just for fun. if he treats you well and you like him, go for it :)|`|4ce5b454fceaa5c7da06ac84b31319f6aa	If he's coming up with excuses for why he cheated then he's likely to do it again (he doesn't see it as his fault). But if not then you could give him one chance but just be cautious with him, keep him at arm's length til you can trust him.|`|bpTTrwZIaa	Well take in consideration he's cheated and disrepected girls in the past.<br>  Age is a big facter here. Maybe if he's older he might have matured.<br>  Definately be cautious but if he DOES cheat on you, don't take the little ***** back!|`|aTKprEybaa	i would ask him if he's cheating and if he says he's not then i would trust him, but if u seen him cheat that's a different story.|`|VVXrodrVaa	Deff not!<br>  People like that rarely EVER change.<br>  it sucks, but its true.<br>  he really sounds like a player!<br>  you can do better :)|`|9njPFl7aaa	What makes you different from his other victims...

OG4410bdaa	I'm naive too<br>  <br>  my husband handles all the money and bills<br>  of course if I ask to see our monthly budget, he'll show me<br>  but there's no real reason for me to ask to see it, he handles the money well enough:<br>  bills always get paid, money always goes into savings<br>  he even plans a certain amount for myself to shop or go see a movie with<br>  <br>  however, I still felt off about our arrangement...<br>  so I talked to my husband...I told him that I didn't want him to misunderstand me...that I loved him and I trusted him<br>  however I spent so many years living on my own and taking care of myself...its scary to have someone else take care of you for you...<br>  he wasn't happy but at least he wasn't mad at me<br>  <br>  in the end, he offered to set up a separate bank account for me- just a few thousand dollars in savings so that if anything ever happened between us, I would have money to get me through the first month or two while I found a job and a place to live<br>  having this account in my name gives me the security to know that I'm safe if he ever changes...my husband has never laid a hand on me but other men have so that's always been my worse fear, and now I know that I wouldn't have to stay with him for financial care if he ever hit me, I could leave<br>  <br>  I will probably never use that account<br>  but it still feels safer to know that it is there if I need it<br>  and it feels nice to know my husband cares enough (and is understanding enough) to not be angry that I need this extra security<br>  <br>  another security measure that I asked for and he was happy to ablige me with was this:<br>  a written log of all the monthly bills and HOW to pay them (ie account numbers, phone numbers, addresses, etc..)<br>  This is especially handy to have if my husband ever fell ill or injured (say a serious car accident or something else in which I would be left paying the bills on my own for awhile...god forbid permanently)<br>  My husband is in the military and its important to him that I feel safe and taken care of should he ever be deployed or have prolonged training...however this is still a good idea for even non-military couples as fatal car accidents are on the rise|`|1d96f37d161f5b36db2cdf3bb334c59caa	I wish my husband would keep all the important papers. He is so irresponsible that I don't even trust him to keep up with anything. I have to keep up with everything but as for the money part he handles it. He makes the money so as long as he is giving me the money to pay the bills and a little extra for myself, I don't mind.|`|wE89mPZ3aa	Just tell him you would like to know more about the bills and such.

If you want to be a part of handling the money and papers, speak up or forever hold your peace.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	I don't understand how he 'keeps' the papers in your house together unless he locks them away from you.  Take it upon yourself to familiarize yourself with his organization system and or suggest to him getting a new filing cabinet and organizing it together so that you are both included.<br>  <br>  Is he blatantly keeping them from you or does he simply have his own way of organizing and you don't feel comfortable riffling through?  Personally I "keep" all of me and my Hub's paperwork, but that's only because I like things to be organized just so... and he is aware and has complete access to where they are.<br>  <br>  As far as the money, that is something you and your Hub can work out together.  Do you work or stay at home?  If he is controlling moneys you bring in too-- I would consider this a real problem.  Whether you are bringing in income or not I would suggest sitting down with him and explaining that you would like to have a hand in the household budget and finances as well.  To incorporate yourself, I would sit down with him and re-create the budget, and if it is important to you open a checking account for yourself for moneys to be deposited into.  Divide certain bills and responsibilities between the two of you.  For example- My husband pays rent and utilities, and he keeps enough money for gas.  I am in charge of misc. other bills that come up (Dentist, lawyer), groceries, and savings.  <br>  <br>  If he finds this something to argue about I would be incredibly worried about his intentions of controlling you and excluding you in such a manner.  Hopefully it's not that he wants you to be totally reliant on him to live, and doesn't want you to be capable of handling these issues in case you ever decide you want to leave.  A man like this is very dangerous.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|X7i59NeIaa	You say you have been together for a long long time. You need to demand to know about your finances, the money situation and all important papers. As a married couple you both need to know these things in case something happens to one of you.

Good Luck.|`|a1pmr73vaa	Mainly he has control and you do not.<br>  The fact is you have to both talk and get it worked out.You need your own money and control too or else there will be fights about money in the future.<br>  you have a right to know where the money is going period.Talk to him please and don't be a fool and let the man control everything.|`|faT4MyVkaa	That's how we do it.

Im bored e-mail me!|`|TLim2pBTaa	I think that you should be with the one that you like the most and have the friends stay out of your relationships. Friends can be great to talk to at times but they can also cause trouble for relationships especially if they are haters.|`|fFJUeDkbaa	well forget about your ex, if he let his friend get in between you guys then he's not worth it anymore. try the new guy!|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	Talk to him calmly! Everything will work out as long as you talk to him calmly and don't fight about it! You shouldn't let other people get involved in the relationship-- but then again if someone is outside the relationship they usually have very good advice. So if they are good friends listen to them, if not, ignore them, and have a good relationship!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!

PbFL8jh2aa	If he went a year without trying any other girls, either he really likes you or he's a loser and no one wants him.<br>  <br>  I say raise the expectations from him. Hang out with him, but request that he talks to you more, blah blah blah. If he really likes you, he'll try his best to talk more and change so that you'll be happy with him.

7vm3iBsQaa	Well obviously, even though she says she isn't mad, she is. my friends do the same thing with me sometimes. Just give her some space for a little bit, eventually she will probably think the reason that she is mad at you for is stupid. If that doesn't work, then just bug her until you get something out of her I guess. Don't just move on. I would hate to lose a friend! Just let her think for a lil bit until she comes to her senses, and i hope everything turns out okey dokey!!! Good luck!|`|8D4VUJy2aa	dam no offence but she sounds like a ***** u should try to make alot of eye contact with her again and ask her why she has been ignoring u, maybe she has  new friends that shes hanging out with  i know how that feels in a way cuz i have a friend that did that to me  if that dosnt go well just **** it dont talk to her but try to make things work first|`|8akkqCpWaa	what i would do is try to ask her if somethigns wrong.

I2L0LbFkaa	You should stop complaining about your poor grandma and be thankful that you at least have one and appreciate her because she wont be around forever.

You should be glad that she puts a roof over your head.  If she wants to sit and watch the TV that she wants to, she is probably paying for it so it is none of your business.  I think a LOT of people that are answering this question 'understand' your problem, and the problem is you.  I think YOU need help, contact social services in your area and have them place you in another home that has more rules and regulations and things to do to keep you busy - your Grandma is doing what makes her happy so what.|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You don't mention your age or what your grandmother's health is.<br>  Try turning off the TV and talking with her.<br>  <br>  Is she able to look after herself at all? If she isn't capable, you should consider talking to Senior Services to see about getting a caseworker out to evaluate her. If there are some bottles of prescriptions, there should be some doctor's numbers on the labels... consider talking to the doctors and have them summon her in for an exam so they can evaluate her for mental/psychological problems. She may either be just depressed, or she may need to be institutionalized.<br>  <br>  If you are 16, you should consider working a part-time job while going to school. You can make yourself scarce while building some savings so you can move on with your own life. You will need savings to put a deposit down on your modest first apartment after you hit 18 and have graduated. Look at it this way... at least your family didn't just toss you into the street. You can make some preparations and launch from there. <br>  <br>  If you are a self-supporting adult, you don't have to stay there with her. Consider finding other living arrangements.|`|VssLCEhGaa	Why don't you sit next to her, try and start some conversation? See what she is watching?

On top of that, when you do get away from them don't give them your phone number or address.

RBQrgByeaa	No, of course not. (Rolleyes.)|`|YNDMwFEJaa	I have cheated but not on my husband, I did it to get out of the relationship. It was a very big mistake once i knew what i did to him, and how i made him feel ill never cheat again.|`|KmC0K59taa	I cheated on my first husband.  I'm not proud of it.  But I admit it.  I got married at 22 and I realized after a year that it was a mistake.  He started getting on my nerves, the sex was awful.  I couldn't stand him anymore.  I started sleeping with his best friend.  We actually separated before he knew I cheated on him.  He did find out eventually as his friend and I had a year long relationship.  It was a colossal mistake that I still regret.  I realized a few years later that my husband was a good, decent, hard working guy and that I really screwed up.  I was lucky enough to find another man and my ex is remarried now as well.<br>  <br>  I cheated because I was young and stupid and I hadn't figured out what I wanted in life.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	No, not in 13 years anyway. He's not a cheater either although I have given him the freedom to do so should the need arise. He's not really that type of man. We have a very active and fun sex life for a couple with 3 kids:) We are also best of friends and closer than anyone...we are 100% honest with each other about everything. I am not a huge "talker" (Kind of guy like in that way), don't share feelings about every single thing in the world...it all plays a part in the strength and maturity and trust in our marriage. I would never go behind my husbands back to seek something. I would let him know what was going on in my head, no matter what.|`|mCM363I9aa	never have, never will<br>  <br>  However he did (emotionally only) he said that he was tired of my nagging. Which was true, I was unhappy so I nagged all the time. <br>  We are now past that stage, he is really happy and so am I.|`|vXubuAqzaa	never have never will not worth it*|`|VHaSKFC2aa	I did because he did, it wasn't revenge though, it was more like since he did it I felt like I wasn't loved anymore so I looked for it elsewhere. <br>  <br>  But yeah, its always a mistake, unless of course the person you cheat with is the person you end up being REALLY in love with instead. Otherwise I'd just not do it. <br>  <br>  Also, I've found someone who'd never do it to me, and I love them to much to do it to them. Cheating is something that's not "accidental" and so if you can think about it then you can think your situation through better and come to a better solution. ^_^|`|KZlgdMeEaa	I cheated on my bf of 2 and a half years not something im proud of by the way. At the time I did it becuz i was angry at him for not showing me enuf attention, not making me feel important to him.

pTkjGfBRaa	I both disagree and agree with you.<br>  <br>  I disagree with you because you're actually combining creation stories.  <br>  <br>  The first story begins, "In the beginning," In the first creation story, God created men and women at the same time (Genesis 1:26-28).  The first creation story comes from the priestly tradition, which is why God rests on the seventh day, to emphasize the importance of the sabbath.<br>  <br>  The second story contains the Adam and Eve account and a God who physically walks around in the garden of Eden.  This story begins in Genesis 2:4b and comes from a different tradition.<br>  <br>  So, in answer to your question, in the beginning God created woman and man together, and God saw that his creation was good.  BUT, when God created Adam and then Eve, sexism was created and all hell broke loose.  <br>  <br>  I would agree with you that since sexism has been created, there really hasn't been a damn moment of peace.|`|2292675077dae921390116e7862cc989aa	who said Adam was a rough draft?|`|88ItgDEoaa	No I don't.

Calling him, or talking to him in person is better though! You really need to talk to him about what's going with his life. It will help him to talk about it, instead of just bottling it up inside, It will help you, to figure out what's wrong, and so you can help him, and it will help the both of you, because opening up to someone, trusting someone, and knowing that they care is an important part in a relationship. Good Luck, hun!|`|xSq13mXFaa	yes i am young but in my perspective i would talk to him in person and tell him that just because we arent going to be together doesnt mean that we cant be friends and talk because friends talk and hug and hang out right?(:<br>  <br>  i hope i helped

Then you can know you'll be rested after 8 hrs so you can set your alarm for 10am and wake up and hopefully be refreshed. <br>  <br>  -You can also set your alarm for the early time you want VERY loud so it will scare you awake. <br>  -Putting the alarm WAY out of your reach (say a few steps out of bed) is also a deterrent from just slapping it and falling back asleep. <br>  -You could also set coffee to brew and the smell might make you want to stay awake. <br>  -Any sort of energy drink in the morning, Monster, Red Bull, Bawls etc can help.<br>  <br>  ***Taking showers right away after you wake up, no matter how early it is can help, depending on your personal tastes cooler or hotter will help wake you up. You can also buy energy soap etc from thinkgeek.com. They have a LOT of caffeine things you can try.

BRRYspVBaa	If a guy is telling you point blank he doesn't like you, then that should be your cue to move on. As hard as it may be, if you respect yourself, you need to walk away. Do you tell him things like: "I don't like u, I'm just using you for sex?" From reading your forum, I'm sure you don't. Another thing, if your parents forbid you to see him, then I'm sure there is a good reason for that. Sometimes parents/adults see things we don't want to see or just don't realize it yet because we have never experienced it. Also, just because he is only having sex with you and no one else doesn't mean anything. It only means you are the one that is giving it up. Think positive and tell yourself you do not need a dog like this. If you walk away with your head up and dignity, you will see something better will come your way. You can do it girl!|`|ZjM0ghSnaa	Ok, not to be mean, why the hell are you having sex with your ex boyfriend? and same with your boyfriend.

I hate to say it. You should stop it because he has a GF and that's cheating.|`|HNAVlwV7aa	no he doesn't. he only likes what's in ur panties. dnt u notice that he suddenly didn't love u when u had sex??? and why have sex with someone u dnt love. he could be doin it with others too|`|Z9svX7r4aa	well...<br>  he kinda has a girlfriend.  i was going to say he is not going to confess his feelings unless he was single, but since hes cheating on his current girlfriend with you then...<br>  idk.<br>  i think there might be something there between you, but maybe he just thinks your hot. he might just be using you. sorry. oh and btw, move on anyways. if you were to go out with him, how would you like knowing he might be in bed with another girl...? crappy boyfriend.<br>  yeah. <br>  i wouldnt put up with that. hope it helped good luck
AA10043878	It's fine for a teacher to encourage students to be "team players" and on trivial matters to "go along to get along" but it is crossing the line of ethical properness for a teacher to play match maker in the 7th grade. I suggest that you politely inform your teacher (out of earshot of others) that you appreciate thier concern for your social life but you'd rather pick your own friends. Nothing more (no explanations) needs to be said to them on this since they are wrong to be dipping in this part of your life to begin with. If you are shy or are afraid to discuss this with your teacher for fear of repercussions or other reasons; don't go this alone. Get the help you need from a trusted adult such as a parent, school counselor or ONE teacher that you feel comfortable talking to.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	why can your band teacher tell you who to be friends with?|`|kZ296wkraa	Talk privately  to your teacher.

d36OrpbDaa	I know you're upset, but I think you're upset at the wrong person.  Obviously your boyfriend has no problem with your religion or your interracial relationship, or he wouldn't have brought it up so casually.  He's just being honest, and it wasn't talking about something SUPER private.  I know that religion is a personal matter, but it also, if this applies across religions, is something that you shouldn't be ashamed of others knowing.  So don't be ashamed or feel weird that people know you are Muslim.  That girl "J" is gonna say whatever negative things she wants to, just because she wants your boyfriend.  It only makes HER look bad to be so discriminatory.  It doesn't make you look bad!  There's nothing wrong with being Muslim, and obviously your boyfriend knows that and is completely accepting of it as well.  I think your anger, while understandable and acceptable, should be directed at the discriminatory remarks people can get away with still.  But your boyfriend was being nothing but honest, and the fact that he was proud to talk about you and your religion, and didn't hide you/your beliefs or act ashamed, says something about his good character.<br>  <br>  There's not much else you can do but hold your head high and let it go.  If people continue to make remarks (I doubt his friends will, unless they're douchebags, which you didn't say they were), then confront them calmly and ask why it is they find your religion something to be ashamed of.  They won't have anything to say.  Just remember to stay calm - you'd be an "ambassador" and an example of the way people should treat others.<br>  <br>  People who make discriminatory remarks like that usually have little experience and/or knowledge of the people they discriminate against.  That is why it's all the more important that you stay respectful and respectable - because they will judge you and your religion by your behavior, for better or worse.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much, forgive your boyfriend because he didn't intend anyting bad to happen.  Good luck! :D|`|lfhvNgSnaa	i think you should be proud of your religion. obviously both "a" and "j" are jerks, and not the kind of people you want to be hanging around. so who cares what they think? just ignore them. i don't see how your religion came up in the conversation, but i don't think it was necessarily wrong for him to tell them your religion.|`|WjVsIqbPaa	well i think he told his friends about you because he is proud to have you as his girlfriend. dont listen to his friends because obviously they are jealous of you.|`|2EIvAsZ6aa	You have every right to be upset by this. Honestly, I'm a very private person in general. If I had brought up a woman I was dating to other people, either knowing them on a personal level or not, I certainly would not of discussed her details. Its not that I would be ashamed to be with her, but I don't find it really important to just be talking about a girlfriend with others, especially not her religion. I wouldn't even bring up religion! That is just something that would not of crossed my mind to even discuss. I would of just told them the generalization of my girlfriend, and of left it at that.<br>  <br>  In your case, it is now tricky and unavoidable. What is done is done. Every time you see these people, they will think what they already think, even though it is entirely ridiculous beyond words, to even be concerned with someones religion instead of their character. That person who said " ew, weird " is not only ignorant, but foolish. The comment was totally unacceptable, unheard of, and naive. <br>  <br>  You cannot really be upset with your boyfriend per se, because he did not know that their initial reaction would of been of such concern and ignorance. I do find it strange that he brought up your religion, but in the same sense, maybe he is just proud to be with you, and of your faith.<br>  <br>  As for these other people who he told this information to, there is not much to do to change any matter. They will think what they will, and you will just have to accept that. I'm sure they won't treat you any differently, but people will succumb to gossip and their personal views, and the best thing to do about it is to simply ignore them and their conflicting opionions.<br>  <br>  Don't worry! Just don't bother with them or their remarks, any longer. Good luck on that Master's degree!|`|8FbOtXAXaa	Don't listen to what that last idiot just said. People can be such morons! Anyways, if he knew that you like to keep your religion private, then he should not have said anything about it. But he did say something about it but I don't think it was meant to hurt you. Ignore the girls that made the ignorant comments about you. They don't know who you are or what is in your heart. They just want to judge you based on your ethnic background and they have no right to do that. You are just as good as any of them! I would mention to your boyfriend that you are upset about him telling his friends about something you want to keep private. I'm sure things will work out for you two.|`|9UQlhzitaa	ok so the problem is that something you say is private to you got put on the street.Well did your boy friend know this or was he only supposed to know by what you did not say.<br>  <br>  so why are you letting snobbish people get under your skin anyway. So what if J like your boyfriend he hasn't given her the time of day has he or do you suspect something else?<br>  <br>  if you did not tell your boyfriend not to mention your religion then he has not betrayed you but you have betrayed him by not telling him your feelings on the matter.Also we are only as good as the info we are given<br>  <br>  won't you feel bad if your boyfriend was bragging on you and how you to get along. have you even talked to him about this yet? When we like something we usually talk about it to our friends. don't you?<br>  <br>  if your this upset then it is a bigger part of your relationship then you knew.<br>  <br>  and by the way J is afraid of you because she doesn't understand your religion, neither do i fully but i have some idea of it.<br>  <br>  good luck with this and school|`|vTra7n5baa	Offensive remarks about anyone's religion come up at any point in time so I don't think that is at all surprising.  Neither do I think it is surprising that your boyfriend has some country bumpkin friends.  This is America and their are a lot of rednecks.  Behavior and comments from them and those close to them are stupid, ignorant, and annoying, but you have to accept that they will happen, particularly as the result of a bridging of cultures as your relationship is.<br>  <br>  Yet, you must tolerate and accept that these comments will happen and do not be mad at your boyfriend.  He did nothing to hurt you intentionally and if you decide to date him longer, your religion will come up somehow.  Accept that reality.  You can, however, indicate that mentioning religion or ethnicity should be done more discreetly than usual.  I don't know the exact timeline in this case so I cannot say if this was done too early or not.<br>  <br>  I think you feel confused and maybe you should be if this is your first interracial relationship.  But get over it quickly and learn to tolerate all sorts of people.  It will make you calmer, happier, and emotionally richer as a result.  You don't want a reputation as a prickly urchin do you?  Grow some thicker skin.|`|vp4xjqbLaa	Well it isn't such a big dilema...he told them you were Muslim that's that! I take it you are not a strict practising Muslim as you have a boyfriend which you say is serious? So that means that other aspects of your life aren't so strict either (and maybe im wrong).<br>  Islam is a way of life from morning till noon and having a boyfriend isn't one of the things you should be doing if you were to follow your religion correctly.<br>  So im sure you fit in to the modern society and maybe the only way people know you are Muslim is if they are told or ask.<br>  Don'T worry about him telling those people or the whole world as its is a part of you and you should be proud and not care what anyone thinks as long as your happy with who you are and your bf loves you.|`|HaDR9veDaa	having an interracial relationship these days isn't a big deal. i don't think your bf meant anything by bringing it up.

(you said yourself he knew what his friend "A" was like) it doesnt matter what they think, look at our country now, we have a wonderful african american president and were developing and becoming less racist.  unfortunatly some people are still holding on to strong opinions like "A".  there are many people in the world like that and we cant change their opinion. they have the right to think and say whatever we want.  but im sure your boyfriend doesnt agree.  so you shouldnt either.  you seem confident in your religion and you shouldnt let a couple people shake that.  next time you see her dont feel ashamed stride in and give your boyfriend a huge kiss right in front of "J", after all shes obviously jealous of you because you are in a relationship with the guy she likes.  who cares what they think, you should stay confident and if they keep on bothering you, make it obvious that you dont care and are happy in your relationship no matter what they think.|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	First, I don't know if you were born here or changed your religion, but to say "insignificant part of our relationship"  that scare me.

I would thing all religions would feel this is so.<br>  <br>  Second,  about how you should feel could be one of the follow.  You feel he is proud of you and wants to share your belief with you and his friend.<br>               He is not sure of himself and is trying to impress his friend with the fact that it is a interracial relationship, and that "He's dating a Muslim girl".  showing he is not only open to you as being of a race but also of a religion different from his.<br>              Last of all, he is not a good thinker on his feet and was not thinking of you or himself at the time and just put out something to say without thinking it thru first.<br>  <br>  Being angry and really hurt is not the right response to this, it is to feel you failed to let him know that your relationship and your personnel info. was private to you and about you and him, and please not to give that info. out to just anyone without talking with me first dear.<br>  <br>  I hope this gives you some in site into yet another way to see this all as one big screw up that wasn't meant to hurt you or him or your relationship.<br>  John|`|kWsEnjbqaa	I do agree that religion is a private matter, however you are asking my opinion so here it is.  I do know a bit about the Muslim religion, I'm guessing you do not wear a hijab and are not a strict follower of the religion b/c if you were you #1 wouldn't have a boyfriend and #2 you would only date another Muslim...since Muslim women who are properlly following Islam cannot date a non-Muslim until he converts to Islam.  <br>  <br>  Your boyfriend's friends are most likely not very familiar with Islam, and perhaps your boyfriend also isn't  I don't think he realized that sharing this info with friends would hurt you so much.  Perhaps the best thing to do is sit down with your boyfriend and explain to him your religious beliefs and let him know that in your eyes, your religious beliefs are a private matter...and that you are sharing them with him b/c he is a part of your private life but you'd appreciate if he didn't let the fact your Muslim stand out so much.  <br>  <br>  Usually a Muslim woman is proud Islam, and wouldn't be ashamed if this is what stood out...but anyhow, we're all different in our beliefs and how we portray them.  Good luck!|`|mRWAn2vHaa	First of all, you should be proud of your religion.  I am a Christian and very proud of it.  Religion is a personal choice but it is very important in a relationship, especially if you are dating serious.  My ex- is muslim and he would never admit it, that told me he was ashamed of it, however our relationship did not work because he wanted me to practice Muslim and I disagreed.  I believe what I believe as I'm sure you do.  You have to be on the same page when it comes to religion in a relationship or problems will appear.  As far as the friends go...who cares what they think, they don't not know you and I'm sure they are ignorant when it comes to your religion.  Be proud of how you are and what you believe.  If you are not then you need to evaluate what you really believe.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I think that if one was proud of there religion such as me you should care what people think...you should pity on those people that made those remarks about you because they are probably jealous of you because you have the guy and they don't...I would just forget about the whole thing and maybe if you feel really that strongly about it tell your boyfriend that if hurt you that the first thing he said about you was about your religion...|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Sorry to hear this, this here is an plain old example of people being racist. its so rude and come on people its 2009 its not like ti was back many many years ago.<br>  <br>  You need to tell your bf how to feel, say look talk about me as much as you like but why do you have to talk about my religion, its a scared matter and i like who i am, i really dont appreciate you speaking on my religion, if you want to i can talk to them about it and tell them the correct things.<br>  <br>  but yes you just need to tell ur bf how you feel and say you where hurt and still are because his friends now just see you as the muslim because you told them i was. No way am i ashamed on who i am i just dont want you telling your friends.<br>  <br>  Goodluck hun|`|WgIZUcYfaa	Why would you let anything that J had to say bother you?<br>  <br>  Don't be angry with your boyfriend. He was talking to his friends...not to his friend girlfriend. He probably didn't even realize she was part of the conversation. It's just the way guys think. <br>  <br>  Next time you hear them say anything just be like "EWW! Your white and from a small town! Don't touch me or else I'll get the JESUS disease!" Seriously...you could turn it around if you wanted to. Or just completely ignore it, it really is small minded jealous immaturity. I am your typical "white girl" and I freaking hate it when I hear other chicks say stuff like this. It makes me so ashamed.<br>  <br>  If any of your boyfriends friends had a problem with it, they would probably say something to him, or you, and since they haven't, they don't care at all. It's stupid turd A and J that are the ones who are judgemental little princesses who need to realize that the world is a lot bigger than white blue eyed blond haired small town christian girls. <br>  <br>  Don't let their issues bring you down. Please do not, if you do, they've won...and they don't deserve to win.|`|hSOYndoxaa	Most religions are not secrets. I dont think your boyfriend told them to intentionally hurt you he probably thought you wouldnt mind. I sure wouldnt be mad if my boyfriend told one of his friends that I am a Christian. I am proud to be a Christian and I will tell everyone. Honestly I dont think he did it to hurt you.|`|8K3IucU3aa	its no big deal. they need to grow up. you have to freedom to have any religion you want and if they don't like it they can get over it. he didn't know that would happen and don't be upset because those girls are immature. don't be hard on him he didn't know it would happen and try not to think too much of it.|`|8pw8qDjPaa	people are racist... get over it, its a big part of life. its a small town girl? what do you expect. i'm from a small town. (actually i lived in a large city and the moved to a smal town) and while i'm not one bit racist a lot of people who are originally from here are. and i know it hurts to hear it, but you just gotta be proud of who and what you are. <br>  <br>  as for your boyfriend... i'm sure he didnt mean to hurt you in anyway, he's proud of you and was just bragging about you. dont take it the worng way.<br>  <br>  and were exactly did you hear all this from in the first place? ignore rumors and whatever. if you want to deal with that stuff go back to high school.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	Well, I think you are right, your boyfriend made a mistake as religion is a personal issue and it really should be up to you to let people know about that.  But, like you also said, it would not have been intentional.  These people sound narrow-minded and who is to say that if he hadn't mentioned your religion, then they would have found some other thing so they could talk about you.  I would talk to your boyfriend about it in a calm way so that this drama does not happen again, which ever way you both decide to deal with it (and be grateful about having a boyfriend that loves you and wants people to know about it).  Good luck.|`|tLSXeTIEaa	Well those are some rude people you know. I am a Catholic,but that doesn't mean they have to be so I don't know.... racist.  I have a friend who is jewish and we are best friends. I think the next time you see them say to them "Hey,I know that Muslim,but that doesn't mean you have to be so rude and racist. You hurt my feelings and I don't I should be treated like this.I am dating so and so and if think it's weird or don't like it then to bad because we are in love and you don't need to be trying to  tell us what we can and can't do. I would like to get along with you if you would quit criticizing me and just treat me like you would treat others.".  That's what I would say. I ran into the same problem and now people respect me. I don't think your bf should have told a bunch of people about your personal life. I think it would be better  for you to tell people about yourself. He shouldn't be blurting out stuff left and right about you without asking you. I would tell him he shouldn't try to do that and how you feel. I wish that the whole world would one day just get along with each and it wouldn't have to matter what they look like,or sound like,what they believe in or any of other things. I hope things work out for you and take care.
966laRlHaa	just talk, talk, talk with him.. why he had this idea? it can be a nightmare or it could be real thought. Ask about why he want to do it? Is it so bad to do it? Isnt there another way to solve it. He probably was depressed, which happens to all of us. Just dont think of him as worthless, make him feel as special as can. And call him time to time, to let him know your thinking of him and remembering him.|`|inJ7T1rNaa	Don't keep this crap under the radar. Suicide is serious. First talk to him and try to talk to him into talking to his mom/dad about counseling. He probably needs this! If he won't than you'll have to tell his mom/dad... He will probably hate you for a while because you did, but as soon as hes better he'll thank you for it.<br>  <br>  Remember <br>  First try to talk him into talking to his mom but if he doesn't<br>  THAN you'll have to talk to his mom/dad.|`|EUGoxWXuaa	Hae!<br>  <br>  thanks for the comment on your other question btw!<br>  <br>  i totally agree with the first answer<br>  u should take that advice!<br>  <br>  =)

Zxtiewnyaa	first off, she got defensive with you because she did tell Cody about you liking that other guy. And yes he did tell him.She got mad at you with a answer saying she is sick of people talking crap about Cody. Instead of just admitting that she did tell Cody about the other guy.And why should you worry that she will get mad at you Your the one who should be madat her, she lied to you.And she is suppose to be a friend.friends don't do that to other friends, even if a boyfriend  is involved.You say you and her got over it.You ended up believing her, but with doubts, you both just kinda except what the other had said.just so she wouldn't be mad at you., but you still don't trust him, there is something else about him that you don't trust about him, and it's not just from what he "supposely" did. because you got that feeling, that this person is bad.Right now in your friend's eyes, Cody does no wrong. She is hooked under his spell.What would "I" do? I would play his game, but what he doesn't realize is that he is playing in one of my games too,On Monday met with them for lunch, no matter how much you hate him, don't throw a friendship with your friend away because you don't like her boyfriend "show her" what kind of pig he is.Prove to her he is no good.You have those feelings about him, you do not trust him.Those feelings are telling you something,listen to them.So now let the games began.|`|6HX4u0SRaa	sorry to say but it sounds like your so called friend has chosen her bf over you so the best bet is to cut your losses and find someone else to hang out with also if your friend does ask you want the problem is tell her don't dance around the problem because it won;t go away  be honest and if she doesn't like it that is just to bad she will be looking for a friend in you when the relationship goes sour and that you will have to deal with when it comes around also|`|3JuiUj33aa	first of all its really best to tell your friend how you feel, cause if he's a dog and cheats on her the way he sounds then she's gonna need to know before he does something  she will regret. Plus if she gets angry from you telling your feelings and the truth then she isn't a real friend and isn't a real friend and isn't worth the trouble btw its bad to keep your feelings pent up inside.
5Xp59a3Iaa	My "biological sperm donor" is in prison for an attempted murder charge (intended victim being my mother) and can stay there an rot.<br>  <br>  However, the man who stepped up when I was 10 and became who I now know as "dad", is the most honest, hardworking, sweetest man I could ever ask for my mother, or to father my half sister.<br>  <br>  In your essay, I suggest looking into what it means to be a father. Anyone can have sex with a woman and produce offspring, but it takes a real great man to step into the life of a single mom and take on her kid as your own and become a father.|`|alxuJVsCaa	Well, my father means a lot to me. He spends his free time with me. He flew to Philippines once, [when I still lived there] because I really missed him. He did a lot of things for me that I didn't really thank him back then. He's one of my heroes. You'll get a lot of ideas, when you think of the good things that your dad did for you or someone else.

The note could be as simple as thanking him for helping you out, say something about learning from the best and make a joke about how now you can finally realize your life long dream of pinwheel making or something lol<br>  2.

Do it definitely! Write something saying thanks, the pinwheel sounds really cute I bet he remembers you!

Have fun!|`|fbe600962a1348933b552a6e772b27b2aa	Yes, I think it's cute. Maybe sign the note yours, xiao hai zi, or so. <br>  Ask him out for a coffee, tell him you'll bring a pin.

Make sure she is comfortable and enjoying herself.  Be interested in her and LISTEN to what she has to say Ask her opinion about things AND STOP THINKING ABOUT BONKING HER she will pick up on it and it is a turn off.. Do not look at other girls, treat her as if she is the only person in the universe. DO NOT make any sexual references during the date nor make any "moves" early on. As she walks through doors place your hand gently in the small of her back to guide her through first DO NOT try to touch her butt! Be confident in your manner but don't brag like a idiot. If there is a decision to be made ask her what she would like to do, if she says she doesn't know or doesn't care MAKE THE DECISION and say this is what we are going to do. keep that up for a few hours and if she is at all interested in you she will jump your bones before you know it.|`|4wRonK16aa	u can';t get her to do that til she's ready|`|CPGMIcEoaa	tease her with your Penis.|`|5MWDbW7paa	kiss her neck|`|AA11376151	kiss her neck right at that spot <br>  if that doesn't work nothing will

dFHsAXDMaa	You are absolutely right. people yourself included it seems are never satisfied with what they have and what God gave them to work with. There is someone for everyone and you will find that great girl if you open up and let it happen and be confident that you are perfect exactly how you are. <br>  <br>   As a nurse,  I would recommend talking to a counselor though they can help you with activities to work on your self esteem issues and help you become a more secure confident man.<br>  <br>  But you also have to remember all those men in prison did something and made life choices that got them there. I promise you if they could go back and change things they all would. I often see teens at the School I coach cheering at and think to myself some of these punk kids you know are up to no good... smoking pot, dealing, just being smart ***  need to talk to some of those guys in prison they could really mentor them in making good choices i think. They should have to talk to one teenager a week to show them the path they are headed too if they do drugs and deal and run their mouth, they could make a difference even while being behind bars.|`|pbPe614Raa	wow,nice message right there,honestly.<br>  :D|`|UVscrbwkaa	Well maybe they shouldnt do the shi* they do, then they wouldn't be in prison.<br>  Just get out there and have some fun.

MeeJWmGtaa	You're both kinda right.<br>  <br>  "If he/she is illegal (no visa), then don't expect him to become legal anytime soon. Takes more than ten years."<br>  <br>  That's true if he sneaked into the US illegally in first place, yeah.<br>  <br>  Otherwise, if he arrived by legal means, even if a visa or visa waiver has since expired, the schedule is thus:<br>  <br>  File the paper work.<br>  two to three weeks after that, receive appointment to get fingerprinted and stuff.<br>  About 3 months after that, receive work permit. He can now apply for a SSN and DL<br>  About 3 to 6 months after that, adjustment of status interview, where you're supposed to convince the interviewer that you're having a real marriage based on love and respect, not to gain immigration benefits.<br>  Shortly after that, receive temporary green card. This one is good for two years.<br>  2 years and minus 90 days later, apply for removal of conditions, receive permanent green card.<br>  3 years after receipt of first green card, apply for US citizenship, if so desired.<br>  <br>  That's the streamlined, best case scenario that assumes all goes well. There might be delays or obstacles, mostly having to do with missing or incorrect paper work.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|IvMPh09baa	I assume you mean immigrant, not alien.  what a weird way to post a question.<br>  <br>  after the first interview is approved they will receive a green card and a ssn, basically giving them the right to work here.<br>  <br>  they won't be legal until after the 2nd interview.  this interview is scheduled after 2 years.  it takes anywhere from 3-5 years for an immigrant to become legal through marriage.<br>  <br>  Sorry... but lorena is wrong.  visa or not when they arrive does not matter.  my husband is an immigrant, he visa was actually expired when we married.  that doesn't change a damn thing about how long it takes for him to become legal|`|IocgFjr2aa	Depends on many things. If he/she is illegal (no visa), then don't expect him to become legal anytime soon. Takes more than ten years.

Hope this helps...|`|1o3OqSioaa	I would like to offer a few guidelines on what you should have discussed and have agreed on before you are ready to get married:<br>  <br>  1. Have you discussed kids yet? How many? How to discipline them? Who will discipline them? Will one of you stay home with them, and not work? Will they be home schooled? <br>  2. How will you handle your money? Shared bank account? Seperate accounts? Who will decide what you can afford to buy with the disposable income? Who will be responsible for paying the bills?<br>  3. What church will you go to? How often will you go as a family? How much will you give as tithes to the church?<br>  4. Where will you live? If one of you gets a great job offer in another state, would you be willing to move?<br>  5. Will you have a traditional marriage where the man is the head of his family, and the woman gets to voice her opinion, but the ultimate decision is made by the husband for the good of the family?<br>  6. Do you have the money saved to get a place of your own?<br>  7. Do you have the money to pay for the wedding?<br>  8. What type and how expensive of a wedding are you going to have?<br>  9. What about your family not liking him? What kind of problems is this going to cause, when it comes to the wedding, grandkids, family get-to-gethers? Can this be rectified easily?<br>  10. If not, can you live without your family and/or their approval?<br>  <br>  One last thing, even though I detest arguing, it would really be beneficial to have had at least one good argument before marrying to see how you both handle yourselves when you are really mad or upset. I don't recommend starting a fuss on purpose, but don't hold back if one is brewing, because you really need to know how the other one will act when really angry. No matter how in love you are now, the day will come when someone is going to be pushed beyond their limit, and fly off the handle.<br>  <br>   These are just some of the major issues that should be discussed and a mutual agreement should have been reached before walking down the aisle and promising before God and family that you will love each other until death do you part. If you have reached a mutual agreement about these issues and many others, then I would say that you are ready to walk out of the church with rice or bird seed flying all over the place, hand in hand together, forever.|`|tY4hOjqdaa	If ur asking here ur not ready. I would move towards an engagement of 18 months to see how u grow together during that time period. U r both very young and could use some maturing before plunging into a marriage.

qRKOWgS0aa	First off, there are NO set rules as far as flirting goes. The basis of flirting and breaking the ice is that it is a contact between two VERY UNIQUE individuals. In this case, you and a particular girl. Each of you is a VERY different person from the "average girl" and the "average guy". Some girls may like roses and romance. But maybe this girl is a tomboy and would think those things very dumb. Some girls may like poetry. But other girls may think that is "old fashioned and boring" and would rather have you just hang out with her. <br>  <br>  So the most important key to flirting and breaking the ice is to know as much as possible about this girl before you just barrel up to her. What type of music does she like? What are her hobbies? Watch what kind of clothes she wears. Does she wear long, flowing skirts and peasant blouses? Does she wear jeans and hiking boots? Is she very outgoing, always talking with lots of people? Is she very shy, usually quiet and by herself? All of these things will help you decide how to approach her. <br>  <br>  Let's say you spend a few weeks getting to know what she's about and are ready to initiate contact. The key in this is Slow and Steady. You don't want to leap at her - this would make any human nervous. You want her to think of you as a normal, good part of her life. So start out by making the transition from "stranger" to "that guy I see around". Do that by following some of the Breaking the Ice tips and by smiling or saying "hi" when you pass her in the halls. Don't go into long conversations, just keep up that tap - tap - tap reminder that you are there and friendly|`|MYHOZtNfaa	Confidence is a key, another thing is be genuinely kind to her, don't give her the 'hot' stuff, no girl really likes that, call her beautiful. When you get to know her for awhile, say "hey, i wrote something for you, hope you like it.", tell her why in a poem, or some fashion or form that is genuine and meaningful. Don't give an iPod tunes gift card or something that's typical for a friend, but something warm and heartfelt made by your own hand. Another way is acts of service, show her, not just tell her that you will be there for no matter what, as a friend or whatever means you intend on her. Spend quality time with her, don't just be with her, muse her with her humor a fun nature, and a good wit.<br>  <br>  If you'd like, What's the girl's name, give me her characteristics and I'll write a poem for you to her, to get you started.<br>  <br>  Or something like that, here's a poem I made for a girl i admired:<br>  <br>  Kristine<br>  <br>  K ept killer secret that I disclose upon thee.<br>  R estores reason to the highest beauty's degree.<br>  I ris inks an image of the icy mountain greens.<br>  S erene scene winds the hair that evokes my dreams.<br>  T is' the teeming flare upon your spirit I see.<br>  I n iridescent peace and wondrous character I hope to meet.<br>  N earest to my heart you are, though greater than wondrous stars.<br>  E ver heavnly bliss you are an angel I see, and now believe are not afar.|`|AcgDcQG0aa	If she already knows that you exist.

Approach her one of these days and talk to her and see what she is like. You know sometimes you mistake the things someone likes with their real personality, so you never know.

Remember, she doesnt know you like her, so you dont have to be nervous|`|S5dfa6o9aa	Just talk to her and ask about things that you and her both enjoy or know about.

Does he still like you? <br>  He was always available to you. now that he is not u want him. but Hey if u were meant to be to gether u will be..|`|KrvaPDPvaa	Tell him.  If it is true. Make sure you are not just jealous of his new girlfriend.  Do some soul searching and find out what you really want.  If you want to date him then tell him.  I think it is probably this new girlfriend that has caused this epiphany to occur.  Ask hi how serious it is between them before you tell him that you like him as "more than friends".
AA11611329	I think before you confront her you need to talk with your husband. You both need to agree on some ground rules. If she is going to live under your roof then those rules need to be followed. If she doesn't like it then she needs to get a JOB and get her own place.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't let that go on in my home.<br>  You need to talk with your husband asap.|`|9lCMhK7gaa	Maybe sit down and talk to her. Tell her how you feel and maybe try to talk some since into her. But as long as she aint having sex in your house then I wouldnt even worry about it. Now if she did thats another story. Yeah she should have rules but you cant really make her not have sex. She's 18 now.|`|MOF6Benoaa	So your sister in law was a virgin until turning 18 then slept with one guy who she hardly knew.  Slut isn't the word I would use.  It sounds like a lonely, stressed out girl.  I bet the guy she really liked screwed her over by sleeping with someone else who would put out.  She probably questioned her decision to be a virgin and in a moment of aggravation, gave in.  She needs someone to talk to that won't judge her for that one bad choice.  If it continues with different men, then I would suggest professional counseling.<br>  As far as her freedom, if she is contributing to the house (paying rent or bills, cleaning, helping with family obligations), she is proving to be an adult and should be treated like one.  She should obviously have to follow certain rules though such as:  do not bring strange men to your home for sleepovers; when she does come home late, be quite and not wake anyone.  If she isn't contributing and just mooching for a free ride, that is not very adult and she needs some incentive.  That incentive would be more freedom in exchange for help with the home.|`|bkgBLjuvaa	talk to her, about it...|`|jpyy7Rjbaa	give me her number, i'll have a talk with her.....|`|HvaRGRNUaa	i think that she just wants the male affection for that moment, not the relationship. she wants the emotion of the sex, but not the relationship if that makes any sense.|`|pqFT4pJWaa	run away far away|`|I7ZOgAsVaa	Shes 18 not alot u can do about it except lay down sum ground rules in your house|`|T3b4I4kXaa	You need to sit your SIL down for a long talk about self-respect and all that other stuff. Tell her about all the risks she is taking... and yes, there is the matter of her reputation. She needs to pull back from all of this horsing around and make a fellow "earn it"... as in getting to know each other for a long time and meeting his parents, and at least an engagement. Make sure she is using birth control. Offer to take her down to Planned Parenthood. Make it clear that as tough as she thinks life is right now, it can get a whole lot tougher, and you refuse to be stuck rearing any illegitimate children of hers. With freedom comes responsibility... and she hasn't been acting very responsible. Spell it all out.<br>  <br>  You also need to have some rules for her... at 18 she should have some plans in place... working and going to school... ideally a vocational program at the community college. Set some standards on her picking up after herself, some common area maintenance chores, and deadline for arrival at home on weeknights (so you and your husband will not be disturbed by wee-hours arrivals).
f1c1c8dafe8cc85d8807ccbdff4a484baa	Sounds like you come from a broken home.  Don't look for that kind of attention.  You don't have to say anything about your sex life.  I'm sure your partners have been doing that for you, and I'm sure it doesn't sound good when they are sharing notes.|`|z7BTeUKvaa	Your friends don't need to know anything about your sex life.  Who you have sex with and why is your business and yours alone.  You shouldn't have told them anything in the first place but since you did, I suggest you stop talking about your sex life and they'll stop talking about it too.  Lead by example.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Tell them you don't like being called a slut and for them to drop it.

Tell your counselor the whole story.  Maybe she didn't lose her virginity by choice.  She could have been raped and is too hurt to open up and feels that everyone else should have to suffer what she's suffering.  Tell her parents too.  They might be able and get her to open up and let it all out.  And you and your friends should also pray for her.  And KEEP praying.  Ask God to heal her and give her peace and guidance.  She needs it.  Let her know that it's ok to tell someone if she's been hurt.  No one should have to keep it bottled up.  The next thing you should do is keep being her friend.|`|hQgahDM5aa	don't lose it just because someone says you should. you've gotta wait till the right moment, and the rgiht person. so don't listen to her, because she just thinks it'coll' to lose her virginity at 12. well it's not... i 'll bet, one day, she'll regret losing it at the age of 12, because when your 12, you still don't really know what you want out of life. wait a bit, and find the right person. if she keeps annoying you with a retarded excuse to have sex, then stay away from her... you don't need that sort of pressure.:)<br>  hope this help
bq3AotVNaa	Emotions are powerful things man. Try to be supportive of her, but you have to understand that you have feelings to. She shouldnt be mean to you because of a complication of her boyfriend.

But yes, you deserve to be treated nice, but also realize that she may be more irritable, but has no reason to bite your head off while fighting.

I can't understand why he wouldn't want both his daughters to spend time together, after all they are half sisters. Even though your daughter with him is only a baby they could still get to know each other because if they are not allowed to now they could be very angry about the time they've missed when they get older. I was adopted & my story is a long one so i won't go into it but i discovered i had a sister 9yrs younger than me in my 30's & i can tell you i was excited but angry for all those wasted lost years. Pick the right time & have another talk to him & speak not only about yourself but about both his daughters & see what happens. Good Luck!|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Have a sit-down with him and talk to him again. Explain to him how you're not being selfish, you're just noticing the different amounts of affection he's giving to his two different children. Make sure you make it clear to him that you're not expecting him to neglect his other daughter. Be sure to find a time when you both are calm and won't be interrupted. Try not to turn the discussion into an argument.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't work, you might even have to try contacting the ex. Be very sensitive around her and make sure you don't offend her.

No matter what the agreement was between him and his ex-wife two years ago at the time of his divorce, it's quite obvious that your situation has changed very much. Obviously I'm no expert, but it can't be healthy to keep going that way. Maybe you just need to confront him and say everything that's on your mind. Tell him that the situation you knew of in the beginning should have changed by now, and that you feel he isn't including your daughter as much he is his own. When your child realizes this as they get older, it may be cause for problems between her and her father. The plan can be changed if you openly confront him as well as maybe having a few selective words with his ex, who is probably pulling the strings, and suggesting he keep their child away from you. There is nothing selfish in wanting a normal relationship. I wish you the best of luck, and if things go on like this even after you try again to confront him, then who knows, maybe you can find happiness in moving on.

tY4hOjqdaa	A marriage in this country is a contract between you, your partner, and the government. It allows u to enter into contracts together and also get tax advantages. If and when u have children, the contract with the government comes into play again.....and should u get divorced it really comes into play with the 3rd wheel(government). A marriage license and contract really is a business arrangement. What I would do is keep all of your credit cards and accounts separate in case one takes a hit you can rely on the other. For example, how many couples today could fluff off foreclosure on their home if the loan was only in one of their names? The other could qualify the next day for another home and move on like normal. it is best to have this structure in case you need an exit strategy.|`|IvMPh09baa	thomas- what the hell are you talking about?  thats a HUGE generalization you just made about women.  and quite offensive.<br>  <br>  just so you know, i actually earn more money than my husband... so no investment here!<br>  <br>  legal drawbacks?

Maybe your dad feels that when your mom is home, he just wants to spend a little more time with her. It doesn't necessarily mean that he is ignoring you. It's nice that you want to see your dad happy and you should think the same way about your mom too. When all three are at home, why don't you tell your dad to rent some movies, or go out to eat, go bowling or watch a movie? It looks to me, that you guys need to spend some time together. Good luck.
dFHsAXDMaa	As a mother of 4 kids two of which are girls 17 and 15 I have to warn you to stay out of it and learn from it yourself teenage boys are evil lol and your friend is just going to get madder and madder if you tell her her boyfriend is a jerk. unfortunately you can not make her see that even though everyone else around her sees it. she needs to live and learn on her own, and you need to continue being a good friend and be there when he hurts her and she realizes he is a jerk. But if you are concerned she might get pressured and have sex with him talk to her about it tell her how she should wait until she is inlove with the guy she will marry and about how he 5^ his friends every time he touches her butt then get proof like record it with your phone so if she does not believe you  you can show her a reality check you  know what I mean. but only to this in a situation where you are protecting her because if he pressures her into sex and she does it and he breaks up with her the next week and is kissing someone else in the hall she will be crashed <br>  <br>  I coach cheering at local school and unfortunately i  see this happen all the time girls loosing virginity to easily too soon and being hurt . <br>  <br>  ask her these questions it will give her something to think about.<br>  <br>  do you think someone who really loves you and cares about you would grab your *** in front of the world to show off to his friends and be cool?<br>  how would you feel if you had sex with him and the following week  he broke up with you and you had to see him kissing some other girl in the hallway? <br>  How many other couples at school do you see kissing in the hallway and guy grabs her ***? is tthat girl popular or considered a slut?<br>  <br>  my daughters who are a senior and a sophmore and both have boyfriends come home all the time and complain about a friend or classmate who is making out in the hallway at school acting "slutty"  and they are not talking about kissing your boyfriend that iss normal stuff but when they say slutty they mme the *** grabbing etc.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|3y0w1qIBaa	The best way for you is to respect her relationship for now on.  If you don't, she will think that you are very insecure, end her friendship with you and possibly that she will erase you out of her life which would be a greatest mistake.  Just be happy for her.  You must ask yourself a question.  "Does her happiness is important to me"?
vUoEgKxpaa	haha as in a just yahoo answers friend? lol<br>  thats funny, haha if i happen to find her i will tell her lol|`|mYAbq6fnaa	have ya tried calling her? :D|`|6HX4u0SRaa	try facebook|`|aZvzGTUBaa	Did you try emailing her? If you find her email, then you should send her an email|`|gyBtDSiUaa	what you mean your looking for her? haa
nwsgLAN5aa	If you're completely unsatisfied, you should find new dresses, and fast!  Don't worry about the other ones, you could find somewhere to sell them later.  If you stick with them, you'll only be stressed and embarrassed on your wedding day.  And think about the wedding photos!  Do what will make you happiest on your special day.  <br>  Good luck!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Take a deep breath - this is going to work out!<br>  <br>  What are your wedding colors?<br>  <br>  From your profile picture, I'm assuming that your bridesmaids might be "ladies of color."  When I pulled up Capri on the main colors page, the color looked better on the dark skinned women than it did on the light skinned women.  <br>  <br>  The sash looks like it's detachable - it may be tacked on.  You could change it out for a different color that would coordinate with your wedding colors and make it look less easter-eggy to you.<br>  <br>  Call one your bridesmaids or your MOH & have her try the dress on.  See what she thinks about how it looks.  If you can't get ahold of anyone, try on one of the dresses yourself if you have close to the same skin tones.  Take some pictures and see how it photographs.<br>  <br>  Please keep us updated!<br>  <br>  ((hugs))|`|PAZWfnFtaa	They may be fine, just not exactly what you thought they would be.  Maybe try taking pictures of them in different lights; they may be more photogenic than you think.  Good luck!|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	if by chance you can't change the dresses then for contrast look at bt. orange, persimmon, tangerine - all the different shades of orange you can find - they generally really look awesome with blues! you could use it in your bouquets, jewelery, ribbon accent on the dresses or in the girl's hair. that type of thing - i don't think the style of dress is that bad girl - after a good nights sleep you may feel better about it all -go back and talk to them before you do anything else.  <br>  good luck.|`|N89HLv92aa	Maybe get a shaw or a silk scarf to tie around it. You should be able to get them dyed. But it may cost a lot and you may not like that color either.  You could take them to someone who can sew really well and have them do some bead work to add to the dresses. Good Luck and God Bless!|`|wDigwK2maa	I used to work at a David's Bridal and we generally did exchanges for something of equal or greater value in the store so I would suggest taking the dress back and asking a manager about it.|`|yhfG07Jtaa	If you paid by credit card, phone the card company and stop the charge right now. Register your rights as a cardholder first, then sort it out with David's Bridal.|`|Xnr3sCZRaa	Did they show you a real life example first? If so and the ones you ordered don't look like the one they showed you then you may be able to argue with them. If you ordered out of a catalog or off a picture then you were taking a risk and I doubt you will have any luck changing them or exchanging them. In that case you may be best to try to sell them online and buy new ones. In that case you will have to decide if the color of the bridesmaids is really worth all the trouble. I realize that you want this day to be perfect but some things are just not worth the additional stress, maybe this is one of those things.|`|S5GP2nlUaa	I feel for you my wedding in in May too and I still haven't gotten my dress, back.....it went in for fitting. But in your case I would go in and talk to the ladies and tell them what happened with the colors and all. Some of the workers there are really sympathetic about that because they want you to be happy on your special day. I don't know what else to say but try that. And if all else fails try dying the dresses a different color yourself. It couldn't hurt could it?|`|p6y7STRHaa	Maybe you should consult with the bridesmaids first. See if they are okay with the color, even if it isnt what you had in mind. If they dont like it as well, as them for suggestions on what they think would make it better.<br>  <br>  Trying to sway Davids Bridal might take a lot of effort and time and result in little progress. Good Luck and bless you on your wedding day.|`|MlG6sL62aa	I know how you feel. Except mine's my wedding dress. I just got it in today and haven't stopped crying because it's not the same fit as the one I tried on, and it's a little off white. I just don't feel pretty in this one. Plus, my wedding's in May as well [May 5th] so I'm pretty much freaking out. I'm counting down the minutes until my fiance gets home from work so I can cry to him. =[|`|zYt0kPtzaa	Hey, why not try get them professionally dyed?<br>  Ask around and see if you can get them dyed?<br>  <br>  or there is a really good website where i got my bmaids dresses from and they where $80 each and really nice and the colours are there for you to see www.lightinthebox.com.<br>  and the make the dresses to there size (custom).<br>  <br>  Sorry to hear this, there is nothing worse than getting something you dont want.
yAktIefVaa	hey.<br>  ok well i haven't moved around as much as you but i have lived in about 4 different countries. two years ago when i was 16 i decided to  move abroad even though i could've stayed in england and done A levels but i went abroad and did IB and am still doing it now. it's hard but it's worth it and i think it actually really helped me get into some decent universities and has also been more fun. if you do IB you can easily specialise in science and maths you just take them for higher level and do the languages for standard level. and you will do so many spoken assessments they will become like second nature (trust me i used to be really bad at them but they're a lot easier now). so if you do decided to go abroad i'm sure you will have no problem making new friends, it will be a really interesting experience, you'll make your parents happy and you won't be throwing away your education at all by doing IB. not trying to make your decision for you but feel like i have pretty good experience of this because i was in exactly the same situation when i was 16 and it was honestly the best decision i ever made. let me know what you decide x|`|tH2zBbdEaa	jeez that was long!!! well, i think u should talk 2 ur parents about this.|`|Zadysvg5aa	Do you have a school counsellor ? They may know of a local family that will "foster you " during school term, for a reasonable fee. That way you could go to Germany on school breaks and long weekends, and still maintain you educational stability in England. Could your family afford this expense ?<br>  Otherwise, you will have to go with the family to Germany and start over again.<br>  Sorry, I don't see any other alternative.|`|GgMMvHI8aa	You are old enough to voice your opinion to your parents. Tell them you want to finish school right where you are. Are there student dormatories or somewhere you can live until school is done?
PIIqTgwuaa	no, if you tell the cops that, they will call you a pussy and hang up.|`|IvMPh09baa	abuse is abuse is abuse.<br>  <br>  doesn't matter what gender the abuser is, its still illegal!<br>  <br>  There are ALOT of women that go to jail for abusing their husbands|`|OG4410bdaa	yes<br>  domestic abuse laws protect men as well as women<br>  <br>  however...most men are too ashamed to step forward and get help<br>  they shouldn't be ashamed<br>  but they usually are anyway...sad really, no one deserves to be abused|`|naequcqlaa	Of course there is.  The law regarding domestic abuse swings both ways & what's good for one is good for the other!  No one has the rite to lay an abusive hand on someone/anyone else.  The law is the law, it doesn't matter which spouse is breaking it.  Also, judges frown very strongly on domestic abuse, I know as I was abused so can speak from experience.  Good luck...:)|`|wE89mPZ3aa	Yes.  A woman can be arrested for abuse just like a man can.  Abuse is wrong whether it is a man or woman and the law agrees.|`|NENNHNVPaa	The same law that applies to men, applies to women.  You just don't hear about it as much.|`|mCM363I9aa	share the booze or learn how to spell|`|WjxqhZG9aa	Domestic abuse is just that.  It doesn't matter who hits who.  In fact domestic abuse towards men is super under reported.  It's there, and it's still illegal.|`|hb94oOSeaa	abuse is abuse and assault is assault get out, get help and get a restraining order.<br>  No one deserves to put up with abuse.|`|IocgFjr2aa	Brain damage as well, apparently.|`|AA11122479	yes it is illegal for any person to cause harm to another regardless of their gender|`|p8RvGtNYaa	The laws of physics|`|Awywcn2Caa	Yes it is an assault just like if you hit anyone!|`|7aoHmM4baa	i couldn t help myself from laughing because of the spelling<br>  yes there is ,to answer the question|`|pTkjGfBRaa	Yes, physical abuse of a domestic partner is against the law, regardless of who is abusing who.  While abuse of men by women is illegal, it is under-reported and because of the stigma attached, there is a societal blindness to abuse of men by women.<br>  <br>  Culturally, the main response a man has in an instance of abuse is to leave.  There is a general assumption that men in a relationship are bigger and stronger, so the burden is against them in trying to prove that they had no other option but self-defense.  If the self-defense leads to injury of the woman, the assumption is that the man was abusing the woman.  In general, a man's only option is to leave.<br>  <br>  If there has already been abuse causing bruising and/or bodily damage, photograph and document it, and leave or separate as soon as possible.|`|Nbbh3jl6aa	Yes there is. Not only that, she can and should be arrested and let the judicial system take over. There should be a victims program in your area and it should not be just for women. Contact the prosecuting attorney in your area they should be able to help you further. Also take pictures and dont forget to inspect and if necessary photograph the inside of your mouth. No matter who is doing the abuse it is not only wrong but ILLEGAL. Good luck honey. Lilsquaw|`|pre1k4Pqaa	hi well i think some men carnt be real nice guys then yess.
MvhtwyXfaa	My little brother is 8. I feel your pain. He is favored by my parents so violence never does work, but I swear at him anyway. :) Lock yourself in your room if you don't want to deal with him or pick him up, stick him outside, close the door, then go watch some tv. Just try to avoid him.|`|v0FlUan0aa	scare him n he'll learn his lesson. if not tell your mom :]|`|tOoJL7sYaa	its normal for kids to do that. they all do that.|`|bo4MguzVaa	I dunno, but they eventually out grow it.  My younger sister always broke and stole my stuff as kids, and would cause so much trouble.  Now that we are grown adults, we are best friends.<br>  <br>  I remember my parents put a lock on my door tho, to help keep them out.  But you know, they only took my stuff and bothered me because they looked up to me and wanted my attention, and thought my things were sooo neat.  So, go a little easy on the lad, maybe your parents will get you a lock for your door too.  :)|`|G6ZpnRxyaa	i got a seven year old bro so i will feel your pain<br>  ok so when he started acting like this it started like when he entered 5K so i sat him down & gave him a talk as his freind<br>  i do use screaming sometimes :/<br>  but it doesnt solve the problem<br>  so be responsible & take it the right way<br>  im 14 btw|`|pUoAqU3Vaa	um idk but I'm a younger sister and my older sister is anoting as hell so sometimes think about if you could be annoying to a younger sibling before you say they are annoying.|`|8MGNpc5maa	Tell him either A) Santa won't come next year or B) tell him that if he does something bad again you'll hide his favorite toy.|`|M0vQFHg9aa	He is five, still a little kid who doesn't know any better. If that upsets you, make him learn better. Tell him every time he dose something mean, something bad will happen to him. Like no deserts, no treats, but DO NOT hurt him. My mom use to do that to me when i was five, if I did something wrong I would get spanked or hurt somehow. It destroyed our relationships together, and I never grew close to her. So only small things, like not getting something he wants, and when he is good REWARD him to encourage good behavior. <br>  I know people love to make people suffer, but it won't help with good behavior. Good luck, I hoped I helped.|`|wXNn5qDnaa	I think your brother just wants attention. You can try taking some time out to play with him and care for him and when he realizes that, he'll feel loved and secure. Then when you tell him that you need to work and be alone, he'll be understanding and reasonable.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	i have a little sister whose 9 and sooooo annoying! she copies EVERYTHING i do and she always starts problems with me! what i do is when she tries to start something i just say in a loud voice "wow why are u trying to start a fight i dont wanna fight right now" or something. it works for me :]|`|tH2zBbdEaa	you should probably turn h im upsidedown by holding his ankles and shake him and say, if you dont leave me alone, im gonna shake u!!!!!!|`|I2L0LbFkaa	spank him|`|pqFT4pJWaa	kick his a$$ more|`|OdMUV49Jaa	i know my brothers annnoying and well parents dont understand they make things worser.

dpuY0jWiaa	Hi Besssie,<br>   First of all, congratulations on overcoming your eating disorder! That's the most important thing right now. Don't worry about those sociable aspects of your personality; they're  still there in you and will reemerge gradually as you get back to normal. It could be that you are pressing too much to be like your old self, and it's coming out a little forced or unnatural. You'll be at your best when you're yourself in a relaxed, natural way. Remember that all of us have our emotional ups and downs and can't always be 'on'! It's part of being human. So be more patient and easy on yourself, and give yourself a big pat on the back for being the strong, smart, sensitive  and yes - witty and funny - young person you are!<br>   -P.
5f232a0e5670e2a5079c788abe7190a5aa	Hit the ceiling like you said or just go up there and tell them to be more quiet because it is annoying|`|rlvrgwWvaa	Confront them in public. That'll embarrass them into stopping!|`|GgMMvHI8aa	Bang on the walls. Seriously, just the fact that others can hear them may get them to quiet down.  <br>   <br>  OR next time you see them outside SAY something. Tell them you have little ones and have heard them many times.  <br>   <br>  Tell them to turn the radio on or something.|`|AA12135516	If you are on speaking terms with them & they are approachable just say something to them but if not i'd bang on the ceiling cos if they don't realize how loud they are they might be very embarrassed & quieten down. Good Luck!|`|FdixIDR1aa	I would make a complaint with your landlord. They are obligated to deal with these situations, and you have every right to complain. Good luck|`|RK04Jktraa	JOIN THE PARTY!|`|Im4K2eFIaa	Since you have children in the house I think it would be completely understandable for you to ASK them to try to keep their passion down a bit. They can always bite a pillow! lol To save some of the embarassment, maybe try write them a little note and leaving it in their mailbox. Be very simple and polite about it and just explain that your children can hear...they should understand.|`|hY11vYcpaa	Definately go upstairs and knock on the door.... I hate it when my nighbors bang on stuff to get my attention.  Sometimes you just don't realize how thin the walls/floors are.  :(<br>  <br>  If you don't feel super comfortable going up there while they're "at it" you could always try distracting the children with the radio or TV.<br>  <br>  Lots of luck!!|`|3df62cd5d4c4550eefa351b54399e098aa	Had this same type of situation.  Go talk to them and tell them that they can be heard getting it on loudly.  That you don't mind as much but the kids are hearing it too.  If they don't comply then go to management and file a complaint.  They might not realize they are being heard by anyone.|`|YKiS4tefaa	OMG..........<br>  <br>  that is a horrible situation especially for the children. The only way to cut down the noise is complain about it. Go to them and be as nice as possible and make sure to mention your children.|`|zR34WvjTaa	Bang the wall so they know you are aware of the noise.   Give it a few days if that doesn't work write them a polite note and stick it on the door. State that  you have little kids that can hear that adult fun!|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Talk to them and ask them to tone it down. Mention your children.

You don't want to expose your kids to this.<br>  Good Luck
2SIOE10Uaa	Wow, I'm in pretty much the exact situation, so you have my sympathy!<br>  <br>  It's tough to say if he likes you or not, but I do encourage the two of you to keep talking and building your friendship, it often leads to love.<br>  <br>  & As for the dead end conversations, what I've found that works for me is to just ask him, "What's something I don't know about you?" <br>  I guess I'm a little nosey, but the boy I'm talking to loves it when I ask him random questions like that and the answers I get back our always interesting, they can range from, "I just got out of the shower" to something incredibly deep, it just depends on the day haha, but it really opens up the conversation.  Hopefully it works for you too!<br>  <br>  Sorry I pretty much answered the wrong question, but I wish you the best of luck!|`|fe730f7457a84c5c53a41d445c46f630aa	He probably likes you.Text messages mean your not with that person at the moment but your thinking about you.Even if he leaves a conversations dead he still thinks about you.I mean who always thinks about a person that you don't like .Unless you guys are bestfriends.|`|yv9viI4gaa	Haha when a guy does that its perfectly fine :]<br>  That happens to me sometimes..but then the person and I always talk in school or somewere else. Its either hes distracted or he wants to talk to you somewere else|`|HNAVlwV7aa	Maybe he likes u maybe he doesn't. Some guys just lead u on. u may not want to ruin the friendship by asking him and him saying no, but he sounds dumb. watch him for a while and see if he seems to like a girl. but make a move soon if u like him or else he'll just get someone. maybe u can make jokes up and ease urself into the conversation of love and hate.
z33hxpHJaa	I think he likes you a lot and from the way he acts in class, how you describe him acting in class and the way i have seen him acting around u at school (on Tuesday when i actually wen tot school and last week)<br>  i could tell he likes you but i didn't want to say anything because at first you said you didn't like him. He seems really nice and if -she- doesn't like it i really don't know what to say, i mean she likes someone else and said he was a low level, but she doesn't really even know his personality (which is kind of funny) but i think that you should just go with the flow and just not tell her... but if she really has a thing for him being a good trust worthy friend like you are i don't see why she wouldn't tell you.<br>  <br>  as far as i know she just thinks his eyes are pretty and you shouldn't have a big deal over it because he probably (most likely) likes you but he seems afraid to show it (unlike dj haha Jk) he is really nice and if you and him get together (which would be way cute by the way) -she- should be happy for you and not get mad because she can't make up her mind on what guy she likes.....<br>  <br>  hope that helps<br>  <br>  ps- he is cute and i think he does like you!
GgMMvHI8aa	Right now you have to take the job. But keep in mind if she is home alone with an 8 month old baby things are hard for her too. <br>   <br>   <br>  My husband left december 6th, so just over two months. And it is killing us to be apart, but this is the only way to support us and work. It is a hard thing to do. But having a job means food on the table, and clothes for our child. So this is just the way it has to be.|`|PbFL8jh2aa	Things are quite tough on her too, being home alone with an eight-month old without her man. Be sensitive to her as well.<br>  <br>  Have a sit-down and talk to her about this. Tell her that everyone needs the money, fast, and it'll only be six months. Acknowledge that you think it is a harsh blow, but that it has to be done as otherwise there'd be no income and to look after the baby you'll need money. Just be gentle when talking to her.<br>  <br>  Answer mine? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090220191902AAR6rW8">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|zR34WvjTaa	Tell her to build her confidence and independence up.  The way the economy is going right now, you need that job.  While you are gone reassure her every step of the way.  She sounds insecure and needy.  On the other hand I sympathize with her raising an 8 mos. old alone.  I'm raising a 7 mos. old almost alone.  My boyfriend works all day and then coaches until about 7 pm.  When he gets home our baby is asleep for the night.
TLim2pBTaa	No you're not wrong in thinking that way because that is what most guys do. They use females for sex. Having sex is one way of showing your love for someone but you don't always have to express your feelings by having sex, there are many other ways. And don't ever feel like you have to have sex with someone just to show them that you like them.|`|13KBWzBXaa	I am a 51 year old man.<br>  I know 51 seems like really, really old.<br>  The scary thing is it's not! I actually remember being 13 and horny.<br>  Guys are really sensitive and want to be caring men. But they are cursed with testosterone and it floods their brains and makes them do stupid things.<br>  <br>  Girls like sex. It's just a fact. But you girls get something that we guys don't: preggers. And little girls who are menstruating CAN get pregnant. Little boys who are producing sperm can get them that way and will drop them like a hot rock if they do.<br>  <br>  Aside from the recent laws which make sex before 18 a felony in the USA, sex at your age is a really bad idea. It's really best to have it only with yourself. Boys mostly don't know this and would balk at the suggestion.<br>  <br>  They all want to get laid & if you let them they will tell everyone they know that you did it with them.<br>  <br>  Please do yourself a favor and wait.<br>  Sex IS a way to express love, but it often produces babies.<br>  If you KNEW that you definitely would become pregnant each time you had sex, would you do it?<br>  Are you really ready to drop out of school and spend the next 18 years being someone's mom? Is your goal to drive a station wagon and have stretch marks on your breasts at 15?|`|WAgeAuvbaa	Hey you,<br>  there are loads of ways to express love, from a smile, a kind word, a gentle touch, holding hands, walking in the park, skating together, sharing a shake or pizza.  Getting sexual is not how you express love.<br>  When two people are ready, not one and the other thinking yeah ok, then making love is a wonderful experience.  There is a difference between making love and sex.<br>  If someone wants sex with you then ask them to wait, tell them you are not ready, any decent guy will respect this.  Please be very careful, your body is precious and should not be given away lightly.|`|jYnfnrcdaa	I completely understand where you're coming from... I didn't have sex until just last year and even when I finally did it I was afraid that he would just leave me but it worked out well! Some guys just want it and will use you but as women we know who is worth sleeping with and who is not. If you have doubts about whether he is legit wait 60 days before you sleep with him a guy that just wants it will not even give you the time of day after two weeks. Although me and my first are no longer together he's still a good friend and always gives excellent advice on avoiding the scum bags I've taken it and its worked out great!|`|A3Rq88Qmaa	Not gonna lie, a lot of guys at that age are immature and want you for sex as well as you. To know if they really care about you, just tell them you're not in it for sex. They'll wait if they're worth it.<br>  <br>  To show affection, just do nice little things.<br>  Like saying 'I love you' (but only if you mean it)<br>  Dropping little notes in his locker<br>  Baking him cookies and suprising him at his house<br>  Making him a CD with a bunch of songs that remind you of him.<br>  <br>  Trust me there's tons of ways to show affection.|`|F5ptObE8aa	well boys at this age most of the time just want you for your body.<br>  not all of them though|`|W3cKtKfaaa	sometimes sex express the love , if it was passionate one ;)
ropZvmRDaa	Try talking to him, see what he is into.<br>  <br>  Or if you just want him off of your mind then you can just try to think of someone else who you would like.<br>  <br>  If he is your "first crush" then that happens to everyone, every ones first crush is always on their mind. Give it a few months, it will fade away.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|lkTexJ8Kaa	I think u do care if he likes u or not,make up a dream that u had about u and him and tell him all about c how he reacts to it|`|ShNh4whKaa	well maybe try to talk to him. Then at least you can start off as friends.|`|Y1cKH9Tgaa	fine another hot guy to thank about take backstreet boys for instance are maybe even aaron carter. are better yeaht girl get your attichion of boys in worry about grades.|`|m6GSXW40aa	just dont rush it or push it on him... try to build a realtionship with him first and if it is meant to be it will find a way....|`|dbLsIkwcaa	What i would do is just ignore him. if he likes u he likes u. its apparently his losse. and dont go make a fool of urself just for one guy theres others out there.|`|ZJCjgOPuaa	hello this is ujvanee<br>  i feel that i can just advice u on this<br>  i feel u should go in front of him and shake ur hands with him as a freind.Be very frank with him and then frankly tell him whats going on ur mind and if he likes u.Then its good but if not then u have to vanish him from ur mind|`|xC0XMb62aa	Talk to him. Get to know him, maybe he will get to like you or maybe you will find out you have nothing in common and you will lose your interest in the boy and you will quickly forget about him.|`|nXCVQUfDaa	eat poop and drink pee hahahahahahahahahhahahahaha|`|f3960c2e97b2fb203557fb9b972ab664aa	dont think about him pay attention to somethin else wen ur near him. or talk to him. u cant spend ur whole life waiting

NTC6g8hYaa	For now, stay his friend. Get to know him and make sure that he's the same guy he was 2 years ago because two years is a long time. Also make sure he is over his bad days, no more illegalness. You dont want that, itll influence you or something. After you know that he is the same guy, you need to decide. He being the army is a huge obstacle, he will be far away or traveling or well you never know with the army. It's unpredictable. Now remember, you are 16 he is 21, he may want to move things at a faster pace or he might want to find someone his own age, who knows. That's why you need to make sure he's still the same guy. Also, what you did when you were 14, VERY WRONG! that's statuatory rape :( If it's a bad time in your life and you are experiencing problems and he's changed well then stay away, find someone new, this world is big, you'll find Mr. Right!|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	he;s in the army and your going to college....im sorry i know it will be hard but just let it go. you will meet all kinds of ppl and go thru different experinces. its time for a new start|`|hQ82X9gEaa	stay friends for now|`|KTU1oa9Gaa	don't trust him<br>  they dont usually give a "jail or military" offer.<br>  i think he just used that as an excuse to get away without hurting you, and you are younge and he knows he can take advantage of you.<br>  if you know it's a bad time in your life, then don't feel pressure to date him now.|`|AA10185251	wow. beautiful story.<br>  authors should consider a plot like so.<br>  anywho, if you love him & he loves you.<br>  age aint nothing but a number.|`|aZ5QdTXeaa	Babe you know i love you and i know your confused but WHY IN THE HELL would you ask about this publicly?

I'll see you in a few months and i am thinking about you in my dreams.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I think that you should get back together with him...although he has made some wrong decisions he seems good...having a relationship with someone who is in the army can me hard to handle especially if he gets sent away for long periods of time...also usually people in the army like to get married early and start a family not saying that that's what he is going to do but this is from friends that have done this...I think that you should go for it if you really love him you should totally go for it girl!!!|`|YJH5YcjBaa	i say give em a chance, express your feelings, how sweeet he added you lol ......uhmmm im 18 and the guy i think ive been falling for for the past 4-5years is 23.....sooon 24.....guys mature later anyways so the age is not soo much of a bad thangg...|`|tVmnGGuvaa	i agree with blondebaby :)) its whats best for the both of you|`|bpTTrwZIaa	Honey, the way you're not going to get hurt is to just let it go.<br>  First of all, he;s been doing illegal activity.

manL9Xcwaa	when my best friend started cutting i went to the school counsler and texted her mom and told her i was worried about her ( me and her mom were really close) the school counsler talked to her about what was going on and had regular meetings with her and checked her wrists everytime. she stopped cutting within a few weeks and went back to normal. so i dont know if you have a school counsler like mine but i would consider that. and if shes putting pictures up on myspace i'd say she probably wants attention, i mean i dont know the girl enough but i'd say it seems like she wants people to know. but probabaly not her parents you might wanna talk to them too.<br>  i know it sucks, i've been there so i hope everything gets better! <br>  (for you & her)|`|bKfAte8aaa	Weather she's doing it for attention or because she's depressed you need to get an adult involved fast. a teacher, school conselor, her parents, police, anyone.  If she's doing it for attention you know well that this is not the right kind of attention to be seeking- this is dangerious and even if she's not cutting herself seriously she can still get an infection and get very sick. If she is depressed, then she needs to get psychological help fast.|`|8akkqCpWaa	talk to her try to help her find a great guy who will tell her not to do that... ive had alot of friends who did this and everytime i would think of them i would cry! this can effect your friends life forever so try to talk to her!|`|o6uA49Tqaa	dude u need to get her help...she could get very badly hurt <br>  you should talk to her and try to make her happier<br>  tell her that she should move on<br>  you should also tell someone else|`|dbLsIkwcaa	she needs to see a therepist because she's just going nuts over 1 guy.|`|T7uR3nT1aa	tell someone,<br>  or nothing|`|8D4VUJy2aa	ya she is doing this for attention|`|pbPe614Raa	wow,sorry but she sounds hella lame and if i were you i would find some less gay people to chill with.<br>  she is definetly is faking all the sadness,because at her age which im guessing is like 13-15 she really doesnt get sadness yet and probably isnt as sad as she seems.<br>  also by posting those pics she shows that desperate plea to be emo,which is pathetic,tell her the people from yahoo say GROW UP.<br>  because this is a faze in her life where people are fitting people into categories and in the end knowone wants to be friends with a wanna be who cuts herself.pathetic|`|7fdeTRhPaa	Err, I'm thinking she just wants comments on it if she would post it on Myspace so freely.<br>  <br>  I doubt she's for real, she's probably just in on the whole little "emo trend".|`|ropZvmRDaa	My younger sister was doing it for a while also, it is a phase that kids/teens can go through. It also depends on your friend, if she is someone who is outgoing then she might be doing it for attention, but if she is someone that is shy then she might be doing it because she is depressed. <br>  <br>  Tell her that she should not do that, and when she is sad to call you up and talk to you about her problems. That's how I got my younger sister to stop.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|O4VpG9fqaa	She's either jumping on the incredibly stupid bandwagon, or just mentally challenged.  -shrugs-  No-one sane would honestly relieve stress through bleeding.|`|tLyfneelaa	she wants attention it seems likely someone who cuts themselves is someone who needs a way to fix there pain if she were Truly in pain she wouldn't post pictures of it as if her pain was some object to show off|`|qU8HqQsOaa	TELL SOMEONE!!! tell ur mom and dad do not let her know it was you tell her parents if they do not know do not let her know it was u though
a45c2cc73915d245be2735d9c1260381aa	There are way to many signs to just have one clear one because guys show how they feel in many different ways...<br>  <br>  *How to tell if he likes you<br>  (and if he's flirting with you in his special own guy-way).<br>  <br>  A lot depends on the type of guy and his individual personality.<br>  <br>  Shy Guys<br>  These are tough to crack sometimes...<br>  *He'll look at you, until you turn around, then boom, he's looking the other way.<br>  You may 'feel' like he's watching you - but he's hard to catch at it<br>  <br>  * He may do something physical - like grab you in a play way, poke you, play with your hair...<br>  (Remember when you were really young and the guy you liked punched you or tackled you?)<br>  <br>  *He may be working really hard to pay attention to you, but doesn't quite know how...<br>  <br>  *He may ask a friend of yours about you - he'll say it's just for "friend of mine" that wants to know about you.<br>  <br>  *He talks to everybody else - but when you're around he turns silent, or chokes up.<br>  You seem to accidentally bump into him a lot of different places.<br>  <br>  *He may not say a word to you, but he shows up in the same line, at the same movie, etc.<br>  <br>  *He'll give you a little smile from across the room, but if you get near, he won't look up.<br>  Basically - the BIG clue is that his behavior changes when you're around (compared to when he's around his buds or other girls).<br>  DEAD Giveaway - when you talk to him he turns red.<br>  (Bingo - you can pack that puppy up and take him home...)<br>  <br>  These are some of the more subtle clues - keep your eyes open - you may have more guys flirting with you than you realize!!!<br>  <br>  *He remembers little things you mention in casual conversation.<br>  It may take you by surprise. You might have been talking when he was around and two weeks later he'll say, "Well, your favorite food is pasta..."<br>  <br>  *His voice changes when he talks to you in a group. He may say "Hey." to everyone with you, but the "Hey." to you is a little different.<br>  <br>  *His voice gets softer when the two of you talk.<br>  <br>  Sometimes he stares straight into your eyes.<br>  <br>  *His eyes get 'soft' when he looks at you. They change slightly or get relaxed around the edges. It's subtle, but you can tell if you watch...<br>  (You may already be aware of it at a subconscious level - that's what made you start wondering if he likes you...)<br>  <br>  When he's near you or talking with you, his eyes travel in a little circle around your face and land back on your eyes. (Like he's looking at your whole face - then back to your eyes.)<br>  <br>  *He watches your lips. (Dead give away.)<br>  <br>  *His friends start asking you questions - if you haven't met him yet - they may ask what your name is. Or may ask you what you think about 'him.'<br>  <br>  If his friends are paying attention to you after he's been staring at you - it can mean that he's been talking about you.<br>  <br>  *He tells you that you smell nice...<br>  (No hidden meaning here - it's a good thing.)<br>  <br>  *He might act weird around you or seem very nervous. His behavior may just plain change when you're around.<br>  If he's normally quiet, he may get louder, or vice versa. It's the difference in behavior that's the clue.<br>  <br>  If you ever need anything else feel free to email me @: godsbaby42@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  *Much Love* ~God Bless~|`|5488d65a5a874c153dc0083bb5fcb518aa	just flirt back, than he's gonna notice you like him too;|`|8tR3gwwTaa	It's easiest for people to flirt around with people who they don't like.

AA10065812	The fact that you were doing it behind their backs shows you knew it was wrong.  <br>  <br>  Jehovah's Witnesses are not a cult, they are followers of the teachings of Christ, with the influence of pagan beliefs that has overcome so many of today's religions.  Cults center around one dynamic leader.  The JWs have no such person.  The governing board up unpaid and holds their positions for a very short time, than are rotated out.   Also, they are very open about all their teaching and their finances.  But than as a teenager, that's not really anything you would care about<br>  <br>  In the Bible, dating is meant for preparing for marriage, but it sounds like you're way too young for that, since she still lives at home.  Though JWs have the lowest rates of divorce of any religion, including Mennonites, it is still best to wait until age 24 to even consider it.  I've worked with divorced and single father for 20 years.  Over 85% of those who live together, or get married, prior to age 24, break up.<br>  <br>  The Bible also teaches, which is taught in EVERY religion, is not to become unevenly yoked, meaning to marry someone outside the faith can make a person off balanced in their lives.  As I said, every religion teaches that.<br>  <br>  Yes, Jehovah's Witnesses are like no other religion, but that is not necessarily a bad thing.<br>  <br>  If you like this girl, than learn from what she comes from.  This doesn't mean you will be converted or will become a Witness, as that takes time and dedication.  Every baptized and active Jehovah's Witness is a legal minister. That is not something you can do without a very dedicated effort.  So, all you will be doing is understanding why you two cannot be dating.  You can talk to her parents, or any Jehovah's Witness, to get those answers.  There are likely far more teenage Witnesses in your high school.<br>  <br>  If you want to look into it some yourself, you can go to:<br>  <a href="http://watchtower.org/" rel="nofollow">http://watchtower.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://knocking.org/" rel="nofollow">http://knocking.org/</a><br>  <a href="http://www.jehovah.to/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jehovah.to/</a>|`|B1sT1t44aa	If you love her you may just have to convert to their religion?|`|AA11122479	first of all learn how to spell it! learn everything you can about the religion and be willing to commit yourself to a cult like existence or move on. They are a very involved religion. More than likely this is not going anywhere and you can either whole hearted convert or move on.|`|GtPnXzPAaa	All the jhopha wittnesses I met were the biggest freak nastys around!|`|A39CLlP2aa	go to her house and talk 2 her parents and tell them thats not wat u want from her ur in love with her|`|ekTtIliKaa	Jehovah witnesses (that's the spelling) are really big about people being married before sex, so I can definitely see why they would be skeptical about dating while she is still living at home. Try and see if you can set up a meeting with them, explain yourself to them, and then try to go to some events while her family is present so that they can see how you act. You would have to try and convince them that it's not about sex and... even if you do think about it and aren't necessarily planning on waiting until your in your 20's at least and married to go that far... you have to get them to think that. That you really would want to wait (not their choice once she's 18, so it then becomes mute point) and things like that. Get them to know you, to think of you as a good and supportive friend of hers and not just a sex driven perv like they seem to think now.<br>  <br>  and it's not a cult... their just a lot stricter then some other religions, jeez... take this from someone who knows, yet is not biased by being one of them.|`|xC0XMb62aa	Confront her parents and explain how you feel about their daughter, and tell them how great you feel when you are around her and tell them how you care for her, etc. If you love her, do not give up. Keep trying to convince the parents that you are a responsible boyfriend and that you can keep her safe, and you give her the respect and care she deserves. Most of all, earn their trust.|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	Your ex-girlfriend's family is part of a cult.  They do not want their daughter to date outside of this cult because you are "worldly".  Worldly means that you might be able to educate her into understanding that being oppressed by the JW's is nuts.<br>  <br>  Move on.
n8lXItGraa	He knows how you feel, so the little comments about his family aren't necessary.  I'm sure he appreciates the effort you put forth every other weekend...leave it at that.  Hope this helps...|`|Ybo6HS8Caa	I can't stand my in laws.  They are hateful, self righteous people and I do not agree with their views and opinions at all.  However, I refrain myself from speaking badly about them to my husband, because after all, they are his family.  He knows how I feel about them, and because of his respect for me and my feelings, does not ask me to "hang out" with them, or even see them often.  Basically just the major holidays.  However, he is free to go visit them any time he likes, I never say anything about it when he does.  Just because I don't like his family and they don't like me is no reason for him to be less involved with them.  However, if your inlaws are doing things like looking through your mail, well that's just something I wouldn't tolerate.  Opening someone else's mail is a federal offense, and I personally would have no problem with reminding them of that.  <br>  <br>  I think that for the sake of your marriage, you need to find a happy medium here.  I realize that it may be uncomfortable for you to spend time with them, but try to remember that they did raise your husband, and you love  him, so they must have been good for something!|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Mine are dead so I don't see how hating them now would do him or them any good..|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	Why antoagonise him by making rude comments?

I would hope his opinion matters!<br>  <br>  I suggest you grow up a little bit. Or if anything what I think you need is a kick in the *** for making those comments about his parents.  Its rude and its unnecessary!|`|71b5d9acd0e084b723a6c805c9cfd85daa	How old are you?  You sound like a spoiled little girl.<br>  <br>  Those are his parents, have some respect.  Just because you don't care if he talks poorly or hates your parents doesn't mean that he feels the same.|`|po85q148aa	It's about respect.  You may not like them but you should still respect your husbands feelings.  I mean damn.  Don't be so insensitive.  Just because you would let somebody talk down about your family doesn't mean he wants you to do the same.  I would be pissed off too if I were him.  If you "hangout" with his family for your husbands sake then why would you totally ruin it by talking smack later?  Makes no sense.  Either you're doing it for him or you're not.  Kuz the effort you put forth by going to visit with them doesn't mean anything if you just bad mouth them later.
aC6O7vlNaa	Yes, I think you are. If possible, ask your three 'buds' why they don't wanna be your friend all of a sudden. If you don't have the chance to because they kept ignoring you, PLEASE, stop hurting yourself. No one in this world is valuable enough to turn you into a masochist, no matter who you are or who that person is. Take a look at your life in a bigger picture. There are a lot of people in your life who unconditionally loves you and cares about you. This one person who did hurt you -In a horrible way, I assume- is not your real friend. None of these three are. Real friends would never leave you, no matter what happens. Don't worry, you'll find your real friend one day. Sooner or later.<br>  <br>  So, please, stop hurting yourself and start appreciating yourself. Consider her/him as a complete stranger who talks bull about you.<br>  <br>  <br>  I know I'm not some Malibu therapist or psychologist or any of that. But I've been there.

Tell him that you want him to take more responsibility and that things like the bills and the future NEED to be considered. Demand to be in charge of the money that goes in the family and only reward him when he's done the right thing (like buy him more games). Some men need to be mothered by their wives before they become mature enough.

You're married...the bills are now "ours".  I agree with the poster above that suggested you start taking care of the finances and that way you can see where the money goes.  Just make sure you are realistic with your expectations - a family is expensive.  I'm hoping that your wife is going to school with the expectation of finding good employment at the end of it all.  At that point, she will be contributing to the household income also and then you two can reassess how the finances get handled.  But keep in mind, when she is in the workforce, you'll be required to step up the amount you help around the house...it's only fair.<br>  <br>  As for her complaining when you go out with "your guys"....do you ever take her out somewhere nice and get a babysitter for the kids?  If not, then your spending more adult time with them than you are with your wife.

You blew it with him time to get over a 2 1/2 month relationship. I'm sorry if i sound insensitive but 2 1/2 months is nothing at least it wasn't for him you were just someone to help get him through this emotional time. If a man can sleep in the same bed with a new woman for 2 1/2 months and not have sex it means his mind is not on you but on something or someone else possibly his ex wife. The only thing you could ever be is perhaps his friend. A man wants a woman he can trust you gave up that right by going out with another man. When you told him about the other guy you were hoping he get all jealous and want you that much more but it back fired.|`|7d535ccd0098dd19bfe900035ca87c98aa	This is the marriage and divorce section.|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	Good relationships are based on 2 main things and those are communication and trust.  I can't explain why the guy you were seeing didn't go any farther when you slept with him, but maybe it didn't have anything with his desire not to, but possibly something on his part.  But, it sounds like there wasn't any basis for him to get so angry about you going out with the other guy.  What I suggest you do is to hold off on your urges to continue to apologize, and to stop texting/calling him.  Find out now if he feels "absence has made his heart grow fonder".  There's also another old saying and that is "if you love someone let it go, and if it doesn't come back, it wasn't there to begin with".  You'll find the righ|`|CQsD09D6aa	Please be brief.|`|naequcqlaa	He sure has enuf on his plate than to have to worry about someone he cared about dating someone else.  Just because he just "slept" w/you doesn't mean he didn't care for you.  He just might have felt content at the time being beside you & that's all he needed just then.  If things don't work out, I'd say it might not have meant to be.  I'm a firm believer in that things do happen for a reason.  Maybe you weren't meant to be w/him in the first place.  Only time w/tell w/this situation.  But as I stated, he sure has his hands full at the moment, & he no doubt can even think straight let alone think about getting involved in another relationship.  Going thru a divorce & ending a marriage is a very rough thing.  Most people go thru phases of adjustment when they end a marriage.  There are going to be things, hurts he's going to have to overcome.  He honestly isn't the best material to be jumping into another relationship this soon.  You stated, going thru a divorce, so he isn't even divorced yet!  I'd say he is far from ready to get involved w/anyone at this very moment.  Nothing against you, but that's how divorces just so happen to end.  I've been there done that, so I can speak first hand on that subject.  You're rite, it is going to be a LONG waiting game.  If I were you, I'd put him in my past & leave him rite there.  Move on & make a whole new beginning for yourself.  I'd put closeure on this "romance" as it never even got off the ground so to speak.  Let him go his way, you go yours.  IF it's meant to be, it w/be.  If not, then you'll surely know for sure at one time or another.  Go forward, not backward. Good luck to you...:)|`|ub2Dtzn0aa	He told you from the beginning that he was going through a divorce and that should have been your warning sign to not get too involved. Unfortunately you did get involved and now your hurt. If you want to continue to be involved with this man you need to accept his situation and be his 'friend' before anything else. Don't crowd him but if you can communicate through a phone call relate to him that you understand his position and would like to remain his friend without getting too close. He really isnt able to provide the intimate serious relationship you seem to desire at this time. To be his friend is what he really needs and then perhaps your relationship could evolve to where you want it to be.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	Okay, you dated for two and a half months...you couldn't have gotten that serious.
dFHsAXDMaa	"Do you wanna go" is her asking you if you wanna fight,  and as a mother and a cheering coach I can tell you yes if she is tripping you in the hallway it is assault, definitely. Tell your mother immediately and tell a counselor or teacher you trust at school. you can actually get a restraining order where she has to stay 500 ft away from you at all times. at kid at the school I coach at actually went to juvenile hall for kicking a kick with a shoe on cause it is considered assault with a dangerous weapon. when he got out juvenile hall he came back to school and apologized to the kick he kicked and is a great kid respectful happy and more mature now.. you do not deserve to be tormented and bullied at school you are there to learn. And while this girl may have had a rough life with a mother who was or is a drug addict it is not an excuse for treating people poorly!|`|pbPe614Raa	well you made a huge mistake buy talking back about such a sensitive subject.but funny if i may say.<br>  anyway tell that ***** to grow some balls and fight if shes so ****** tuff,because if she has all ****** day to stand outside your appartment and watch you like some ****** dike then she needs to settle what her problem is,otherwise she can **** off.<br>  <br>  hope this helps,cause i totally got your back.=D|`|xnhwmontaa	YES AND I WOULDN'T BE SUPRISED IF THEY JUMP YOU SOON.

If they're really bout it, they can tell u exactly what's going on. Taunt them to tell u what's up. Maybe they want u to be their whore, u never know with broads these days|`|9rhqD6Hpaa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Try to understand human nature as they feel uncomfortable once they see you thats why they used bad words for you.<br>  <br>  Be a strong person & let them barks like a dog, just do your work & don't try to argue with them as more argue you do so same more words they will say for you. You can make any argue which should in smiley way not in angry mood.<br>  <br>  As far I know that your country laws are very strict so pls make some video clip when they are trying to say you bad & then reach to cops to lodge a legal complaint with the help of that video.<br>  <br>  If they are teasing you in school so pls take first step to lodge a complain in front of your DEAN.<br>  <br>  If someone sitting out of your apt so simply dial 911 & ask for help then cops will F**K them.<br>  <br>  The more weaker you behave with them same more heavier they are on you. <br>  <br>  Whenever they said WHORE, you can say that "I am not interested to know your name" then move from that place.<br>  <br>  <br>  Try to understand the situation:-<br>  1. Why they will try to tease, may be you are ugly OR more beautiful OR good in studies OR simple person in living manner which they can't accept.<br>  <br>  2. They want to down your moral so u can take any wrong step in your life which is beneficial for them.<br>  <br>  3. If you try to fight with them personally OR by any other illegal method so they can be bad with you too much.<br>  <br>  4. Always follow first legal way so no one can blaim you that WHY YOU TOOK ILLEGAL WAY.<br>  <br>  5. If they still teasing you after legal way then you can take any illegal step to learn them a lesson, like: call your friends to beat them etc.....<br>  <br>  This world is full of idiots who jealous from others & try to make his/her moral down with the help of tease. You are the ONE & you have to run your life safely after making right decision.<br>  <br>  If you need any other help, pls feel free to contact me.<br>  <br>  Bye & Tc<br>  Mayank|`|ropZvmRDaa	Okay honey, well it is a wonderful thing that you are just trying your best to ignore it! Here is what you should do though, tell your parents/guardians. If they don't listen or take it seriously then when you go to school one day tell your princpal, and then another option, because this same thing happened to me once. Call the cops!<br>  "Do you wanna go" Is verbal assualt, and they can be charged for harrasment for it! Call the police honey! <br>  <br>  Try your best to do some of these options before this gets out of hand!<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|o6uA49Tqaa	They are FREAKS<br>  dude just tell ur mom or the teacher....i know it might seem like they will get revenge on you<br>  there just bothering you because they want to make you scared<br>  but just keep your head up high ignore them and act like their taunts are nothing<br>  smile at them when they do something to you act like you don't care<br>  they stop eventually|`|8akkqCpWaa	they shouldnt of started something they cant be mature enough to end at all! just ignore the problem all together if it keeps bugging you talkk to a adult! dont ever solve yur problem with violence... it will end up really bad!|`|3BsJxaViaa	Oh yes defenately verbal assault... i think you should tape it with either a video recorder or even just a tape recorder so you have actual proof. then press charges!!!!|`|3JuiUj33aa	if i were you i'd call the cops...but that's me|`|OLJekQVwaa	Yes that is verbal assault. I think you should talk to someone about it because this is not normal. I am proud of you that you didn't start a fight with her because that would have mad it worse. Tell the police, your parents, and guidance counselor. It'll help alot, trust me. Go as soon as you get the chance. But you must tell someone. You can not keep living like this.|`|UVscrbwkaa	they are all mouth and no action. if they wanted to hit you or anything, then they would of by now.<br>  if i was you, i would go straight up to them and kick their teeth in, but thats just me.<br>  they don't have any rights to be saying things like that to you.<br>  we are all equal.. they don't have powers over people.<br>  they will say the wrong thing to the wrong person, someone bigger and harder than them one day and realise what your going through.<br>  to be honest, i think you should do something to them to hurt them.. even if you aren't a fighter, you should still give it a go.. or it's never going to get any better. if you stick up to them, they are more likely to stop.
RXI8ImdIaa	Well you can forgive, but how do you propose that you should forget? Do you want some kind of memory-erasing device from a science fiction film? What else do you want from the man?<br>  <br>  It happened, you can't undo it. You're dealing with a guy who had a very long, apparently bad relationship. It's no surprise that he is very hesitant to lock himself in to something for a while.<br>  <br>  It sounds like you don't like his emotional baggage. If you take a person as a friend or boyfriend, though, you take them baggage and all. So you have to decide if you can live with this stuff or not. (hint: everyone has some kind of baggage.)|`|sS1jlF2naa	It's Facebook, I think you should grow up a bit.|`|cqOOKv3Jaa	just give him and lil time and space to heal a little better, hey maybe he'll come around.|`|62bdfaff99eb94891a0098fdd62fe168aa	He is neither married or engaged.  He is single!!|`|iPcO4kmKaa	o come on its FACEBOOK for gods sake!!!!!!!!!!!!!! get over it!!!!|`|8pw8qDjPaa	Sometimes people think there are only two statuses... either your single or you're married. Like when you go to the doctor or something and have to fill out papers... its either single or married... no "in a relationship with..." Are you guys married? No. <br>  <br>  And besides, its facebook!!! who freakin cares!!! thats something a 13 year old freaks out about. dont even put your relationship status on facebook! its no ones business!!<br>  <br>  but as far as everything else goes... it doesnt sound like facebook is the only problem here. you dont sound very happy. i think you're guy might need more time... or he just doesnt know how to express love. idk. if you're not happy get out of the relationship. if you want to make things work then just make sure you're communication is strong, dont push him into anything he's not ready for (ie, moving in together) and just give him time. but in my opinion? idk cuz i dont know every detail of your guy's relationship... but i'd almost say break up with him... sorry. =( <br>  <br>  its all up to you though.|`|qL3dGTXDaa	I would not forgive but I would forget. He needs 2-3 years making it on his own before he is really available. Move on.|`|DJo0E2I2aa	don't it's facebook, don't let something that trivial ad stupid end a committed relationship|`|ajgC0KPhaa	Some people just don't like updating their facebooks.

He still got to feel like he can bail at any moment should it go south.<br>  <br>  he can't tell you what he himself is not sure of so he can't say i love you<br>  <br>  forgive by not holding it against him, forget that ain't happening until you 2 resolve the trust issues. Now you don't trust him and he doesn't trust falling for you so there you go <br>  <br>  i can't tell you if you should stay or go but now if you want to you can work on the relationship if you want it<br>  <br>  good luck|`|AXRRvt46aa	Honestly, i think you should break up. If he is afraid to be in a relationship with you then your relationship isnt going anywhere. A relationship is going to have fights, MANY fights especially when you get married! Its the healthiest way for a relationship because you don't hold anything in from each other. And his response "Its nobodys Business." ? wow thats just plain rude. He should be proud that he is with you and know how to show his feelings. Im really sorry, it just doesnt seem from what you put in this question that your guys' relationship is going to go anywhere based on what hes said. ..|`|HxHvhZAsaa	he sounds like a putz, a real douche. actually more like a woman, is he on his period? so when you guys fight what does he do just want to run away? not work on things? he obviously wants to find someone else, since he is distancing himself. your instincts will tell you everything you need to know on these type of decisions, not people like me. dont be dumb, see the truth and spare yourself future hurt.|`|8g3Uz6PCaa	Tell him that you are still mad about the facebook thing and try to move things slower so both of dont feel rushed, tell him why it hurt you when he put that on facebook dont hold back your feelings that will just blow up in your face as a big fight, so just be honest with him.|`|4ce5b454fceaa5c7da06ac84b31319f6aa	Guys often do things without thinking about the whole situation so now that he's changed it maybe you should have a chat with him without getting angry and explain to him how you're feeling, he might even open up to u.|`|st9KHhoKaa	give the guy some space to breathe<br>  <br>  men do not like being chased<br>  <br>  be elusive and if he really wants you he will seek your attention|`|TrN7L35Daa	i doesn't mean any thing as long as he apologized and it was a good one than it is nothing but if he does anything like that again than cut your losses and run|`|osusVJk0aa	ignore him to see where his head really is.|`|du5MNrQ6aa	wtf it's facebook...grow up. its all in how he acts towards you not what his status is. ****.|`|4NZfT6acaa	give him time, he still has feelings for you, just he might have other stressful things going on in his life. ask him next time you get together if somethings bothering him,or if theres anything YOU can do.it will make it sound a little more relaxing, especially since some guys dont like to be questioned. but i dont know him, its hard for me to answer not knowing if hes been distant, or if its just the facebook problem.|`|XVTCsfWVaa	He is still getting used to being single although he is in a relationship. Recently divorced men are a breed all their own.<br>  They don't remember what being single is about. They long for companionship and a relationship but do not want to lose or sacrifice their heart too much.<br>  <br>  Not to say that if I was you and saw that I would be hurt too. If we had long discussed that it was an exclusive monogamous relationship and I saw that I would be upset. <br>  <br>  The good news is when asked about it he did change it. You have to give him credit on that. I am certain he is cautious from his past and is making certain to sort through his baggage before moving on to living together or engagement etc.<br>  <br>  It all depends what you want to do. If you think their was more to it (testing to see what else was out there) well that is another story.<br>  <br>  The pinnacle "metamorphosis" I went through in the dating world is when I  honestly addressed my wants and needs. Does he care for you , do you enjoy your time with him-yes. The problem is on Valentine's day etc if you desire a card or some declaration etc. You deserve that. You deserve to have the relationship you want and deserve with or without him. Make sense. For whatever reason he maybe a great guy it may be timing and not that he will not one day move on. But if you want more and he can not or won't provide that. You must do some serious soul searching and ask yourself will I wait to see where this will go or will I move on to find what I want.<br>  <br>  It does not mean you will not be together one day, but for now you should have the relationship you want, deserve, and need. You don't have to settle, wait, beg, or plead for it.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ZKcg7YV8aa	You know he may not be over this whole marriage thing yet. Just talk to him seriously but if you don't feel it just break it off. You don't need to waste your time on someone who doesn't want to commit to you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|urQnRQ4jaa	There is something going on that he is not telling you just by that comment if we fight I will feel trapped...that's an excuse right there you never know he might be having people come over his place that you don't know about...I would try and get to the bottom of things and try and see if he lies to you...

Make a list of 20 trivia questions about the bride – her favorite food, her favorite dinner place, the travel destination that tops her list of places to see and similar questions. The questions should be such that the answers may be known to her close friends but not necessarily. You could put in a couple of very obvious questions at the beginning just to get everyone in the mood of the game. Make copies of the list of questions. Get the bride to fill in one sheet, which is the master answer sheet and get all the guests to fill in answers that they think are correct. The guest with the most correct answers wins. <br>  <br>  Bridal Trivia Bridal Shower Game #3: Back In Time <br>  <br>  This one looks really neat if done well. Make a list of major events in the bride’s life and the years they took place. You may need to consult with her mother or sister for details. Include things like year of birth, year of graduation, year of first kiss, year of college graduation, year of first date and the like. Make a dateline and put all the items in the order they occurred leaving the year blank. Let the guests fill in the year they think the event occurred in. You can make a large version of the dateline on good poster paper and decorate it for the bride to keep as a memory of the bridal shower and a keepsake.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	My sisters came up with some of the best games for my bridal shower.<br>  <br>  Toilet paper wedding dress...they get two rolls of toilet paper and 5 paper clips each group must get a model and make a dress out of the supplies given.  The bride to be picks the best and that team gets small gifts.<br>  <br>  Famous couples game...Name off one of the names and they must name the other on a piece of paper the one with the most gets a prize....for example the hostess says Brad Pitt and they must write down Angelina Jolie.<br>  <br>  These games were so much fun!!!! Good luck|`|crxbob5jaa	Bridal shower bingo is fun. Make black BINGO cards. Simple 5 X 5 grid, with B R I D E at the top of the columns. Ask each guest to write the name of a gift she thinks the bride will get in each of the squares. (You can have the center square FREE.)  <br>  <br>  As the bride opens the gifts, the guest marks off that gift if it's on her card. When someone "bingos" have a small candy bar, bag of candy, or something small to give the guest. Keep playing as long as gifts are being opened. <br>  <br>  Just adds a bit of time to the gift time because people have something to do besides staring at the bride as she opens gifts.   <a href="http://www.bridebingo.com/Bride_Bingo_Blank.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.bridebingo.com/Bride_Bingo_Bl...</a>|`|hKss8M9Raa	At a shower I went to the host had interviewed the groom ahead of time, asking him random questions about himself and their dating history, and had video taped his answers. They asked the bride the question and what she thought his answer was and then played the tape. It was cute! They also made her eat a War-head candy for every answer she got wrong, but I don't think that's necessary. They also played a game kind of like hot potato where they passed around a package that had been wrapped several times while playing music. When the music stopped they person holding it had to unwrap one of the layers. Whoever unwrapped the last layer had to wear whatever was inside. It ended up being a bracelet!|`|P4YTpBmdaa	You could play a couple games.  I gave my new sister-in-law a bridal shower and we played the "spice" game and how well do you know the bride (or you could do couple).   The spice game is you take spices 10,15, 20 and seal them in baggies ( I used lollipop bags and stapled the tops down).   You place them around and each guests has to guess the spice in the bag.  You could even add coffee, sugar, cocoa etc.  We had a lot of fun playing that.   And how well to you know if just that you ask questions about the bride/couple and see how well the guests know them.|`|CaPZrWVWaa	I was at one where they played "bingo" where the answers on the bingo card where answers to questions about the couple. I was at another where the mothers wrapped their child (bride and groom) in roll of toilet paper (like a mummy). The first to finish 'wore the pants' of the family.|`|l43NSgHyaa	Start the shower by presenting the bride with a pin (something bridal like).  Then, instruct the guests to say, "Pin" every time they hear someone else say the word, "bride" or "wedding"     So, for example, you're sitting next to Aunt Mary and see says, "Amy is going to make such a beautiful bride"   You can say, "Pin", because Aunt Mary said bride.    <br>  <br>  The object of the game is that whoever is wearing the pin at the end of the shower wins a prize.   <br>  <br>  I played this at a baby shower once, using baby words.  It's nice because no one is forced to participate.

Or you could just tell him if hes going to be doing those types of things behind your back then he doesn't have to worry about being with you anymore, cuz u really dint deserve it. He needs to know what its like without talking to you or being with you for a while. Also tell him to talk to that girl Bret, because flirting in front of you is just plain disrespectful.

One weekend is not much.  And  your parents who work to support you, live for the weekend too.

Or that there was a family emergency that may have tied up the phone line for a while.

(often leaves room for the kids to climb in...at least a couple of them)|`|ICLekd2Vaa	ok, ur a size 4. wtf is he? orca? lol<br>  <br>  he may take it the wrong way. i propose you explain its the mattress. u need a different one for ur back and the space is there for the other bed?? :)|`|IvMPh09baa	tell him his fat butt is taking up the whole bed and he stinks.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Let him know you plan to add another king or two to your living arrangement!  If he's nice, he can even watch.<br>  <br>  (Actually, my wife and I just began using separate beds because of sleeping problems and its worked like a charm.  We both sleep better.)|`|wE89mPZ3aa	Are you going to sleep in it?  If so he may have a problem with it .  I can understand why you would want one but he may see it in a different way.  Just talk to him and tell him how you feel and go from there.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	JayJay, you need to find some LOGICAL reason for this. He may not mind, provided that there is room, and you do the making of the beds. I do, though, wonder just how large you two are.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|UrNMuhFKaa	Jay Jay how big are you any way. My goodness. <br>  You have another issue going on here and it is not that you want to spread out.<br>  What's the real issue?|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	How about a futon or daybed in the bedroom inst|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	If my wife said something like that to me, I would buy a sofa bed for the living room! <br>  <br>  Get the hint!|`|y9CgveCGaa	I suggest eating lots of fiber one bars.  Then he'll demand it.|`|2089c2125bd52f479e8785a63e67137daa	tell him for the swapping your planning on doing??|`|WA8feS8taa	That's weird, why wouldn't you want to sleep in the same bed as your husband? He'll never say yes to it because it's a waste of money to have two huge beds in one room and he wants to sleep in the same bed as you.|`|ahSDb7Tzaa	dumbest thing ever, your telling a man to waste complete money on something you don't need, this is just telling me you don't feel nothing when your in bed with him, if you know what i mean, and you just wanna be seperated when you wake up every day.|`|Xi5Jno6haa	I get that need to sleep comfortably. Just tell him that you're not sleeping comfortably. Good luck.|`|iKJycf6Zaa	2 king size bed. I think that is too much.|`|PQwRl27Jaa	just say hunny i need a nxt bed n wht ever size u need n if he love u n hav the money he should buy it for u, n just tell him sex will be better.|`|Im4K2eFIaa	Haha tell him you want to have orgys in it, maybe he will be more willing to get it lol|`|AFjehuZ5aa	Just go out and get one while he is gone.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	sleep in the middle spread eagle
L6DZZ6SJaa	is the person who made the ring a master jeweler or a regular jeweler? Your jewelry store will know if he is, and if so probably market that to clients. My ring was custom made, too. It was done from a bar of 18K gold and a bar of platinum instead of a wax mold. It also has a lot of details that were hand engraved by the master jeweler who made the ring for me. The reason I bring this up is because these are aspects that add to the worth of the piece. There's more to a ring's appraisal then just the diamond quality and how much gold is there. See how detailed your written appraisal report it - a second appraisal (from a high end jeweler... don't go to a mall jeweler!) can never hurt! Good luck!|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	most insurance companies prefer to have two appraisals - while you may trust the jeweler insurance companies trust no one!  sounds like a gorgeous ring - congrats!|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ask your insurance company if they want a second appraisal, since the one you got is from the jeweler who made it.|`|JtEBaOdjaa	If you don't trust his appraisal then you wouldn't have gotten the ring there. (or shouldn't) don't bother with a second one, just a waste of money and time.  I don't know why the specs would matter so much that you need a second opinion. Do you love it? that is the only question that should matter.
dFHsAXDMaa	Okay as a women who grew up in Watch Hill, Rhode Island on the ocean and attended some great beachy weddings I would say have a New England Lobster bake- a  table set up with shrimp cocktail appetizer  and cheese and crackers during cocktail hour..... then for dinner serve new england clam chowder and salad, lobster and  baked potato you will need to offer an alternative to lobster for the few people who will not eat it or may have allergy how about prime rib ( easy for caterer to keep warm till time to serve) and potato <br>  <br>  good luck happy planning hope this helped|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	I automatically think fish and chips at the beach. I've also been to lots of upscale restaurants that serve those and they don't come across as strange in the least. Call up local restaurants and see if they offer off-site catering. Most do but you have to ask, and generally, they are much cheaper than regular wedding caterers.<br>  <br>  Also make sure to have something for those who don't like seafood. Perhaps a pina colada chicken breast or something similar.|`|X6YY0OS6aa	To celebrate the beach why not have some shrimp scampi or salmon.<br>  with a squash, zuchinni, onion steamed together as your vegetable side and of course a garden salad.|`|JgT3k7Ocaa	how about a seafood stir-fry/medley of sorts with white fish, scallops, shrimp, crab and lobster?  <br>  you could also do a maple glazed salmon.  <br>  i wouldn't do chicken 'cause we all have chicken at home and its not a 'treat' kind of thing.  <br>  but a nice baron of beef would be a good thing.<br>  you know the side dishes and salads that you want.<br>  i'd suggest scalloped potatoes, potatoes au gratin, baked potatoes, baby potatoes with their skin on and glazed in butter.  <br>  how does that all sound?  have a good wedding.....|`|8a8CZqGLaa	These are all just ideas.<br>  <br>  Appetizers or Hors D'oeurves: crab cakes, skewer shrimp, lobster and shrimp spring rolls, crab and mango salad, vegetarian egg rolls, grilled chicken skewers, tuna tartare, vegetable crudites, tropical fruit, sushi, soups, salads<br>  <br>  Entrees: London broil, penne pasta in Asiago sauce, salmon in champagne cream sauce, chicken picatta, sole with crab and spinach, beef tenderloin with sauteed mushrooms, shrimp and crab lasagna rolls, carved prime rib, carved herbed turkey, carved ham, filet mignon with a lobster tail and bearnaise sauce, filet mignon and shrimp on a sugarcane skewer, filet mignon and sea bass, just filet mignon, pork tenderloin, balsamic glazed chicken, orange basil chicken, seared rack of lamb, mahi mahi, scallops with shrimp and lobster tail in roasted garlic<br>  <br>  Sides: cucumber spears, fruit salad, asparagus, zucchini salad with plum tomatoes, broccili and bacon salad, summer squash, bell peppers, green beans, baby carrots, roasted red potatoes, garlic mashed potatoes, rice<br>  <br>  Desserts: sorbets, chocloate fondue fountain, petit fors, tropical fruit, ice cream, cobbler, chocolate covered strawberries, mousse, fresh berries and cream
aMQD2UnWaa	Here I am at work crying after reading your story.  OMG!  I'm really sorry.  It is too soon to move on.  Yes it hurts big time and it will for quite awhile.  I, too, lost my Dad.  I was 22 and he was 52. Your Dad sure seems like an awesome Dad.  You were very lucky to have him. It is so hard to lose someone that you love so deeply and only time will truly heal. I would hope that you would carry on your Dad's positive and optimistic personality.  Make him proud by being that hard working person that is sweet and caring.  Make him rub off on others through you. Without involving God, I don't know what else I could tell you.  I am really, really sorry.|`|Hnf2MYhaaa	I would have to agree with the people below me whether you like it or not im gonna speak about God because he does not make mistakes.It was your fathers time to go and now he is in a better place.He have to seek God and pray for yourself and your family.Then you need to ask for his forgiveness because you blamed him for the death of your father and not wanting to hear about him.You can get through it will be very hard and it will take time but you will be fine.|`|JiUwpYSXaa	I lost my father when I was 21, while he had been sick for awhile, it was still a shock.  I was in college and for good period of time I couldn't concentrate.  With him gone, I flunked out of school.  He had always been there to get me to study to get ahead.  Fortunately time heals.  In later years I graduated from college remembering what he had wanted for me.  All I can say do something positive in his memory.  His memory will always be with you.|`|M3CsxF2jaa	sorry honey ,No Religious... that is what you need right now.. God|`|MdhkBhLPaa	Sometimes you just can't live in pain forever. You should know that your father is in a better place no and he doesn't suffer anymore. Yes, its gonna take a while to heal but try to be strong and keep your head up.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	Well, you will never accept the fact that he died.....it's always going to hurt, which is normal.......but eventually time will go on and it won't hurt so bad......you can't really do anything about it....    P.S.    What's so bad with telling you God will always be with you and comfort you.....i know that it doesn't seem like it, but one day(hopefully) you'll realize that God is the only one that will comfort you not some stranger on Yahoo!Answers......|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	no God answer I don't have one anyway because lately I have been questioning his existance anyway   the only thing I can say is for you to stop trying to feel better or get over it ,b ecause you will not it will take time   aster all it has only been a month  the death was sudden and violent so just mourn your father, the chock & anger will not go away it will just slowly evaporate and from time to time when you remember it ,for example his anniversary, duringthe hopidays you will get angry and that will be OK you don't need to give explaination to no one   just keep him in your heart and celebrate and celebrate his love, make proud  I know I am not been much help   but the true answer is   To take one day at the time, for you to have lots of courage   and to nerver forget how much you two love each other
VALxlwYSaa	I can't see why they would...   I mean, obviously they would be curious about your old school and they might ask a lot of questions but why would anyone interact as if you were really different? Unless they were shallow?|`|CIzrjrykaa	probably but who would really know?|`|3snd4XYnaa	well,  im 13  and i go to boarding school, and i guess, its a hard experice but it will all depend on the person.  Because some people here CRY everyday, some dont care if they dont see thier parents and they all take things differently.    So maybe its not going to be a big deal, but you would react in a different way if thry hadnt been boarding.    hope i helpped =)|`|2qGYl1Btaa	I wonder why parents send there children away . I feel it is not good for children to be away from there mom and dad I don't get it please tell me the benefit

EsnFmcMFaa	well when i first meet a girl   its her looks   but then once i get to know her   it will be her personality before looks|`|V4PA9foJaa	yup, the looks first and then the personality!!!|`|w5PXLYvkaa	smart, funny, cute, someone who shares the same likes and have alot in common. someone who will care for him and not be to snippy|`|zxa2fjpyaa	looks first then personality. Looks draws me in, and personality makes me stay. Someone that is able to carry on a conversation, funny, and smart.|`|761dtewpaa	the ability to commit to a relationship and monogomy.|`|cqOHW9nsaa	If we want sex its going to be looks. If we want a partner is going to be personality and intelligence. I don't want a brain dead woman to be my partner. I would probably end up cheating on her and she would be too stupid to find out.|`|qDpFSqn4aa	10 guys are going to give you 10 different answers.  Mine is good sense of humor, intelligence and beautiful eyes, it's how my wife hooked me.  One look out of the corner of her eye and a blink (not wink) and I was hooked.  That was 24 years ago.    Hope this answers your question.|`|3VJvfjbIaa	i like my women to like herself with respect for herself and me!!    I like the girl to be happy with a nice smile!!
cuvBHGyraa	Of course not. But it does kinda depend on what type of clothing. If it's not slutty and too too revealing then you're fine. It all depends on if you appreciate it or not. But I see nothing wrong with that in the least bit. Just don't take advantage of it and abuse him. Just say thanks and let him know you're appreciative. Hope this helps!!|`|N6I2PljOaa	no he probably just buys the clothes because he wants you to wear them :)|`|3vehhd7Kaa	ok guys want to feel good that they can provide let him spoil you here and there but let him know you could find a way to provide for yourself|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	If this is the only way he shows he cares about you, then yes. It's kind of like he's buying your love. But it could be that he does it just because he cares about you and he wants you to look and feel good. I know I buy my boyfriend clothes all the time...mainly because I want him to look nice, and when you look good you feel good. If clothes are something you really like, then he's just showering you with gifts.|`|MvhteSZVaa	Hell no!!! My boyfriend does the same thing and I just love it. All that's shows is that he love you and he willing to do anything for you. He buy you clothes to show you what he like to see you in.|`|MGHER8Otaa	There is nothing wrong with it, but you don't want it to be like my Ex-Boyfriend. He thought that because he bought me clothes and took me shopping he owned me. And he would try and tell me what to wear, so if this is why he's buying it for you, honey you might as well just get your own stuff! Occasionally here and there is fine, but not all the time! and you should get him things sometimes to show you appreciate him as well. =]|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	NO! your're lucky.|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	It depends do you ask him to buy you clothes or is he just doing it out of the goodness of his heart.|`|Molu004zaa	Not if you're buying stuff for him too.|`|fCZKGBjBaa	Not at all. He probably just likes to see you happy and see you in nice clothes. but DO NOT expect it, just let him want to do it. If you start expecting that he's gunna bu you everything than he'll start to think your just with him for one reason, the $$$$. But don't forget to buy him things every now and then to make him feel special too!|`|0JgenGPtaa	i have this type of problem a lot. instead of clothes, my friends treat me food! i feel bad because i don't want them to spend their money on me.     i have them stop, because i know it's hard to earn money. the things is my friend do not expect anything in return.    i wont say it's wrong for your bf to buy you clothes. do you tell him that you appreciate it? you should, it will make him happy.    some guys expect "things" in return when they do stuff for you. just be careful.|`|gZ0NPuleaa	As long as he doesn't insist that you wear them or act too controlling. It should also be a once in a while thing.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	wow you are lucky. no-take advantage of it if he has themoney.|`|EsnFmcMFaa	no its not weird  maybe he just likes to spoil you    id buy some lingerie for my girl|`|yyIVrngcaa	Seems like hes trying to win you over with material things...    Dont give in...Don't take advantage of his buying you stuff either...guys will use things against you.    have your parents or yourself get you what you need.|`|9CUaikUEaa	no! my bf bought me clothes once, he has great taste and spends a lot ;)  what would be wrong with him buying you clothes, its sweet?|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	no..but if he ALWAYS buys you clothes..then your taking advantage and thats fkd upp.|`|UDX3qgy5aa	NO OFC NOT  thats really sweet of him just go with the flow some guys enjoy buying their girlfriends stuff  as long as its good clothes ;)  he's just trying to express how much he likes you|`|RyF0GGJ1aa	No it wouldn't think so. If he wants to buy you clothes, I don't see anything wrong with that.|`|jMAn10NOaa	nope. just show him how excited/happy you are, even if he picked something you're not too fond of. when you're happy, he's happy!
V4PA9foJaa	Tell him with care and passion that it's over between you too, remember, with care and passion, not with disgust!!! and cut him off slowly, if you know what i mean..and it would be very wise to tell about this to your parents or some one you trust...and lesson learnt, your number is not meant for giving it around to anyone who asks it..Good Luck!!!|`|RyF0GGJ1aa	Tell him that you don't want to. He doesn't care about you, he just wants sex. You should just forget it. I admire your decision.|`|fBbrDGA7aa	Jeez this guys expect you to do him, just because you gave your number. He is an immature kid that is will be leaving anyway. Do you really want your first time to be with a jerk off like this guy?|`|Jph6y9viaa	say no to something dont act too easy or else  he ll think u r a whore|`|ihe7xV6Raa	tell him to go a way and u don't want to have sex with him|`|UxbjvAaRaa	tell him that you hardly know him and your not ready.
PAxR2gFdaa	Definitely!  Whenever my crush is around I talk about history.  Don't ask me why; he must think I'm such a big geek!<br>  Also, if he wasn't my crush I would have said something to him by now.  I'm near him all the time.  It's just because I like him that I haven't said anything.  I know that, I know it's weird that I DON'T talk to him and am fine talking to everyone else, but I can't seem to get the courage to actually form a coherent sentence.<br>  I also feel like I ramble a lot when I'm near him.  It's my heart speeding up that makes me nervous and then... I worry about my hair or my shirt or my perfume... it's terrible really.  :P
y9CgveCGaa	Will they be appearing on 360?|`|avhgLEu8aa	He'll have nightmares for the rest of his life.|`|f9sL3WgQaa	Nah..fair game!|`|uW1ZlA2Haa	If the pictures were in one of those pop-up books , then yes I would pay 26 cents .|`|5boLbxzdaa	Hey...I think it's fair!  Sharing is caring right?|`|kaaP8y2oaa	oooh i hope he forwards them to me, this gotta be good...|`|alYomnsvaa	You realize I'm going to sell these to the highest bidder now, right?|`|RJQlvMyMaa	You'll scare him for life.
wE89mPZ3aa	You can order what you want to but it does not mean you will get someone to love you or stay with you. A woman treats a man good and respects them when they care for them.  You can find someone that loves you and respects if you really want to but it is up to you.|`|IvMPh09baa	foreign women know how to treat a man... hmmm... so why don't you take a trip to africa and find a woman there.  I'm pretty sure they would treat you real nice, maybe they'll kill a monkey for you and bring it home for dinner.<br>  <br>  I am also convinced thats its probably your small penis thats the real reason you can't find a woman.|`|Ne7xr36Saa	why dont' you put yourself on a male-order-groom site and move to another country.... us women are tired of being judged by guys that only love "young, hot" ones!  And do a few crunches before you go, plane seats are getting smaller!|`|iD4ejChZaa	i never saw a tall, handsome man w/ a hot body with a foreign woman, they're always like you or small men.|`|ul6P8doWaa	DAMN!!!..........redhead2 and Jill are totally slaughtering you, dude.<br>  LMAO....their comments.....I'm nuetral and didn't give anyone a thumbs up or down......thought you should know.<br>  <br>  **Just a word of advice:  when you post questions like that on here, do expect to be slaughtered like that.|`|G50ucmllaa	Haha!  Seriously after asking questions here I feel like a freaking genius and a perfect wife...I'm not.  There are many of us out there who are good wives, but we only come to Yahoo to answer questions when we are bored.|`|RPhla0R7aa	lol you should try to look around more, I don't know what kind of experiences you have been through to want to do this but think it twice.|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	American women understand how to treat men, they also understand their own mind.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Are you serious?  God, get off the computer - this is like your 2nd question in less than 5 minutes. Meanwhile, posting stupid answers.....|`|YHcyuka3aa	Bad ideal. We have enough foreign people here already.|`|d1TTwwUUaa	WHATEVER|`|CQsD09D6aa	What is the question? Something about mail order bride??? Win, win??? You sound more like a lose, lose.|`|NRBa2LNmaa	Thats not fair, to put all American women in a catagory like that. We understand men, believe me, & we chose to be who we are, strong, independant and proud women. On the other hand, if you think a foreign woman will love you more, then go for it!|`|XkJZmjENaa	Do you really think foreign women will find a big ole belly attractive, you are just soo ignorant!!|`|m81dfyOYaa	Get a Korean wife, they'll wash you feet since you can't with your big belly.|`|a1pmr73vaa	random lol!<br>  <br>  order ur bride..just make sure is legal.
aipChC3haa	I'd say give $100-$300.<br>  <br>  And, my  congrats to the couple =)|`|dFHsAXDMaa	Okay the general rule of thumb is what you think the cost of your meal is...... this is usually the standard gift for non family<br>  <br>  hope that helped|`|AA11285960	300-500 dollars|`|2o3BHgCCaa	$150 - $350 I would say. Assuming they are paying about $100 per person or more.|`|Ly37Dhvxaa	$150-250$|`|Y9djVW1Naa	$100+|`|CaPZrWVWaa	In Chicago a marring couple spends at least $100 a guest. You want to cover your plate and give a little bit more.|`|l43NSgHyaa	In New York and other more urban/suburban areas of the Tri-State (New York, New Jersey and Connecticut).  The average is about $100 per person or $200 per couple.   However, people here tend to base their amount on where and when the wedding is being held and how much it costs for them to have you (the price per plate)  If the wedding is more upscale, then it's probably more appropriate to give $250-$300 per couple.<br>  <br>  But, if they're more regular middle class people, the average is about $100 per person.  In some cases, you can give $75 per person, if you really don't know the couple all that well.
eUcUQcefaa	Nope. I'm open-minded.<br>  <br>  If their taste in music suck, I'm fine as long as they don't make me listen to it.|`|sJClbSHGaa	Probably not. But I don't really have to worry about that since my boyfriend and I have very similar musical tastes. We both love Avenged Sevenfold, listen to Panic at the Disco, chill with the Killers, and goof off with Unicorn Kid. Diverse tastes, but so much fun.|`|GSqaUAFYaa	music is my life, to be honest.<br>  <br>  i like so many different genres (except satanic)<br>  <br>  <br>  so unless they listened to satanic music, then i wouldnt care..<br>  <br>  i love all types of rock, metal, pop, gospel, r&b, reggae, club, techno, hindi, etc etc|`|PFLfqYfhaa	Yeah, it wouldn't matter to me. I would prolly keep an open mind and try to see what he likes about the music. i might end up liking it too.|`|cc60f4f1d4566c6c7c8ccf86e13ab348aa	I could. I am big into music, but I think I could date someone who had completely different taste than me. Maybe I could learn to like their music.|`|3j1QX7xAaa	I wouldn't really care what kid of music they listened to, as long as they still let me listen to what I like lol|`|Sc51ASmqaa	No i think that is really messed up and only thinking of themselves. So what if they like different music!|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Yes.|`|AA12336306	Probably not.. I too am a huge music person<br>  I definitely couldn't date someone who had different taste in music..<br>  If they were to play their genre around me, I'd be almost disgusted.. haha

I love my room i would go crazy without it. I had my tanning bed in there but it was a little crowded so i took it out.|`|AA12095067	I've already got my study and dressing room.<br>  <br>  If I could have another one, it would be a home gym.

Nobody can go in there not even kids.|`|88UWPOkJaa	i would put a couch,phoneand a refridgerator|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	Anal beads.|`|39e9dda5be0b2e2098eda11c3273a895aa	I would put a pink chair, with a pink tv and pink pillows. etc|`|HE56Jra6aa	A punching bag. So I could blow off steam.. and pretend that I am beating my ex to death..Ha Ha!|`|u1uECuFNaa	Books, computer, television with DVR.....desk, radio, big window....<br>  A mini fridge for my cold bottled water.....<br>  A soft fuzzy rug and a fireplace.....a bathroom in it with a huge tub....|`|f9sL3WgQaa	12 Firemen!|`|h8l1H4N4aa	I won't have to build the room.  It's been in the 'planning' stages for years in my head.  Both kids are in college now, so whoever moves out first has to take all their stuff with them.  It'll have all my hobby and craft supplies which are currently hidden in closets and drawers all throughout the living and dining rooms.  It'll also have a stereo and a good lock.|`|X7i59NeIaa	My computer and all of my art stuff, my music, my doll collection and all of my beautiful little faeries etc. Just my personal things that I love. I would have a very comfortable lounge chair. Maybe a small fridge with cold drinks in it and some salad makings. It would be a place for me to retreat to when I needed some space for myself.|`|5qFmukWwaa	It would be a library/music room.  Lined with built-in bookcases - hundreds of books and favorite art pieces.  A big comfy chair and next to that a table for my coffee.  A big soft afghan to curl up under.  <br>  I guess I could answer a ton of questions if I was just after the points, but I find I restrict my answers to questions that I find interesting.<br>  What would your room be like?|`|IvMPh09baa	I would put my husband in there lock it then throw away the key.|`|2vaGZ4eDaa	Egads, I have a room exactly like that.  I'll be honest - I have all kinds of collectibles in it going back to when I was a kid, including about twelve boxes full of old comic books, bobbleheads, paperback books, CD's, a stereo, this computer, and a lot of material for my job.  It spans every decade of my life, it seems like.|`|AA11969451	I actually had a room like that...<br>  The walls were painted a light lavender, the room held my personal library of books on religion and spirituality (over 300 books) There was an over stuffed love seat, a comfy settee and a small rocking chair. There were two small tables that held incense, stones, candles and a few other personal items. There was a small stereo system that played soothing music.<br>  It was lovely...SANCTUARY.|`|OG4410bdaa	my husband and I had that before we got pregnant...<br>  the living room was his room- he kept his guitar and all his CDs in there and I never went in it<br>  the second bedroom was my room- I kept all my books, my school stuff (I'm still in college), and my cat's climbing tower in there and he never went in that room<br>  <br>  then we found out that we were pregnant...<br>  so the second bedroom went from being my area to being a nursery: my school stuff went into a desk in the second-bedroom's walk-in closet...right next to the box with our christmas decorations since that closet used to be just for storage....my cat's climbing tower was moved into the living room, which meant that my husband's music equipment got scuffled around and into a corner...one baby managed to take both of our "spaces" away...yet neither of us really seems to mind being alittle more crowded<br>  <br>  if I could have "my room" back<br>  I'd get a nicer desk for my school work...something bigger so I could spread out my text books<br>  and I'd get fish tank, something to watch to help me stay calm during exam week...like a quiet little study buddy, lol!|`|d6cbd4f49a6660cc733a0b7ea8151199aa	Why would someone ask a question like this?

3JfADTIDaa	I think that a lil extra is sexy. But obviously YOU don't. Whether your girl likes it or not, it seems that you're uncomfy with your body, so hit the gym, my friend- trust me, your confidence will skyrocket! Good Luck!|`|TGmXnJUeaa	you've got low self esteem..she obviously likes it.|`|tlLeWMtvaa	I'm thin :)  And I have always had a thing for the larger guy.  I don't know what it is about them but I much prefer bigger dudes than weedy guys or dudes with massive muscles! Both of the which are a major turn off for me.  I also know a few other women that think exactly the same thing.  So just because you don't have to body of Brad Pitt it doesn't mean your girlfriend isn't truly attracted to you.  You need to be more self confident!  Talk to her about which positions she prefers. Or you could suggest new positions to try that you might feel more comfortable in.  Maybe try avoiding the positions your not happy in and see how she reacts. She may ask you to use those positions again - then you know that she doesn't mind!  Also - if you are happy with your weight then good for you!  If your not then you could always try to lose a bit.  Mention to her that you are going to aim to lose weight and see how she reacts.  But don't feel like you have to! I bet you any money she really does enjoy it and finds you just as sexy as you find her :)  If you chose to lose weight then make sure its for YOU and not anybody else. Also, it would help to boost your confidence a lot!    Hope I helped  x|`|9CUaikUEaa	well if i was turned off by a guy i physically couldnt be an actress and pretend i was all loved up.  so she doesnt seem to mind to much, but im sure she would be even happier if you toned up.  good luck,x|`|pGsVIqdyaa	well i would say dont even think about this..she is adready with you so she dose love you for who you are|`|Zn7NNavKaa	sweetie, if she is with you and loves you, it most likly doesnt bother her. why would she act?  if you want to hit the gym do it to be healthier, do it for you! sounds like you are being harder on yourself than she is being on you. you have a hot woman that loves you! enjoy it!|`|yyvMOwQjaa	Your only option is to convince her to lose weight that sounds really insensitive and be careful with the way you word it to. Don't crush her.|`|q4V7Zi0Haa	You seem like a really reasonable person. Going to the gym once a week never hurt, i think it will help in the long run. Especially if the girl is making an effort to look good for you.|`|563ea2da5972305f3934b47e0c36e0a3aa	ive been with one chubby guy...seems like maybe your size..and I am with a tone built guy...with the other guy...i didnt even notice it...as long as he was getting it done, i didnt care!! lol but now I probably wouldnt like it at all!!! it might would be a turn off|`|4uJ3asPVaa	If she didn't like you she would be with you. Im 4'11 105lbs & my bf is 6'1 260 && it doesn't bother me at all....if it would've i would've never gotten with him or even had any sexual contact with him! Lol girls are the same way. We feel awkward with our bodies too.! but if you're feeling the way you are maybe its because you're not comfortable with yourself & there are always ways to change that...whether it be going to the gym, or lights off, finding your better side, or not doing it, or whatever! lol
OG4410bdaa	it doesn't sound shallow to want your spouse, your partner for life, to have the same values as you<br>  not shallow at all to make sure you share values<br>  in fact it sounds smart to make sure you share values<br>  <br>  and if education is something you value, then more power to you!<br>  <br>  think of this<br>  do you want kids? if the answer is yes, and you married someone who didn't value education...then would they care as much about your children's education as you do? probably not...<br>  that's just setting yourself up for a failed relationship<br>  <br>  I value intelligence, I value sense of humor, and I value an open-mind<br>  so I married a man who has these values<br>  we won't fight as much about passing these values to our children because we agree<br>  <br>  you should always make sure to agree on basic life concerns before marriage:<br>  -religion<br>  -education<br>  -children<br>  -travel<br>  -home ownership, etc...<br>  these are all things to discuss before you marry, to make sure you're compatiable|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	You have a right to a decent lifestyle, and any 'potential' partner should, at least, be your equal. These guys are good examples of what you don't want.<br>  <br>  You don't sound shallow, they do.|`|fH2Fw4QEaa	LMAO...working on your PH.d and you can't figure that out? Let's hear it for higher education ladies and gentlemen.|`|cdt4F6ZWaa	It is not bad, but remember, a college education does not guarantee a happy marriage. So your relationships with your slackers didn't work out. Was it because they really were slackers and didn't do anything with themselves?  Or, was it because you were so focused on that person having that higher education??  <br>  <br>  Just because there are the slacker types out there, it doesn't mean that a person without that education can't be successful.  There are millions of people who don't do college for whatever reason and they end up being very successful. On the other hand, there are those who might be great in many other ways, but end up with a lower paying job and thus may be in a totally different "place" than you, once you graduate.  <br>  <br>  You have to push the education thing aside.  The fact that anyone now has a job, is amazing in itself.  Look at all the educated people getting laid off.  We don't know what the future holds and now more than ever, the college education may not guarantee job stability. On top of that, there's the student loan to consider if either of you have one.  <br>  <br>  Only you will truly know who you will really be happy with, and you will know that person's skills and job capabilities.  It is not bad to feel that way about having that higher education, but I do think it is shallow. There are so many smart people out there without the education, who are smarter in other ways, or areas than you. And it will continue to be that way throughout your life.  Don't let that special person get away.|`|R1WapAO6aa	In my opinion no it's not a bad thing because i want someone with an education as well. Sometimes people don't have an education because they didn't have a chance for some reason, so maybe give them a chance if you know they want an education some time in the near future. If they don't want to at least graduate then don't go out with them.|`|dFHsAXDMaa	NO not at all... as an educated young women you want someone who is goal orientated and on the ssame intellectual level as you.... someone to be your equal in life and love. this is perfectly absolutely normal really and does not make you shallow. you worked hard to accomplish what you have and you deserve someone who is not looking at you as the provider and meal ticket so they can stay home and play mom and video games. Come on  be proud of yourself and who you are.... and find a man who is exactly what you want in life and fall in love forever.|`|8rXaN6F6aa	Let's face it, there's nothing shallow about knowing what you want. If you aren't comfortable with someone for whatever reason, don't be ashamed at all. A relationship can't last if you're only with a guy because you feel sorry for him/guilty about saying no just because you're afraid you seem shallow<br>  <br>  If nothing else, you'll at least motivate some very lucky people to do better.|`|4hNRTWtDaa	If that's something that's important to you, it's not bad at all.  If you don't feel you'd be happy otherwise, there's nothing wrong with that.   It's important for you to find someone who shares your values.  Good luck!|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	NO you have standards and you need someone who is on your level. You need to get what you want to be happy if you just settle for someone then you may not end up very happy.|`|7IbT8cUiaa	No it is not bad to set your sights high. You will always regret it if you lower your standards Good Luck|`|AA11122479	No It's just means you are smart and know what you want.|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Robin, what you want is very reasonable. It is not bad. I suggest that you not go out with someone who is not educated. It is not shallow to value education and to limit your socialization to educated people, or to with those who feel the same way as you.<br>  <br>  My wife is currently working on her dissertation for her doctorate in education. I only have a BS, but I do the cooking, cleaning, driving, etc. I like being a house-husband, and we have a house full of PhD's and EdD's and what-not from time to time. Life is much easier when everyone understands what gives.<br>  <br>  Regards,<br>  Dan|`|aeLyiRczaa	There is nothing wrong with your having a standard for what you want.  But are you just as willing understand and accept it when others have standards you do not agree with or do not find of high value or importance?<br>  <br>  I would surmise that you may a tad bit arrogant and look down upon those who have not obtained a certain level of what is termed higher education.  And that is certainly your right.  Make certain that you are happy to allow others their rights in disagreeing with you and your view.  But all in all, if you know what you really want in another, by all means, stick with that.|`|8j7zj9aKaa	Are you in the US or are you from somewhere where your marriage is arranged for you?<br>  <br>  Pick what you want.<br>  If you want a football player who makes you feel safe but cant name the presidents - get one.<br>  If you want a PhD rocket scientist who understands and delights in you for your brilliant mind and not just your hot bod - get one.<br>  <br>  Are you supposed to marry down?<br>  Are you guilty of something if you don't marry a wife-beating redneck?<br>  <br>  There is one human on this planet who understands you best - that is you.  If that one person will not advocate for you - will not protect your interests - who else should?  If that one person abdicates - doesn't it give every other person, including those with less motive to truly service your deepest needs, and serve your best interests - doesn't it give all other people in the world permission to abdicate?<br>  <br>  My only suggestion: be honest with yourself.<br>  If you want someone with a degree - get one.  If you really don't care about the degree, but want someone bright and motivated then - that person might have a degree or not - get one of those.<br>  <br>  When you find a good someone, not a best because both you and they change and grow and best is not about who they are but about who you are together over time - when you find a good someone - then hold on - and be a good someone for that good someone.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  I hope you find someone who is your heart's desire.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	Was it that they didn't value education, or was the issue that you are more worldly?  There is a difference.<br>  <br>  There is nothing wrong with wanting a person who is educated and who you can relate with intellectually|`|Zirwfsg4aa	No, not at all, I think that having standards in a marriage is important, especially since it is something important to you. That second guy you mentioned sounds like a loser to me...|`|pTkjGfBRaa	SNL once did a parody of "E-Harmony" called "Me-Harmony."<br>  <br>  This was funny because we do tend to seek people more like ourselves.  This is neither good nor bad, it just is.  <br>  <br>  There are more than enough things in the world to cause friction in a marriage.  Goals and values that are not in harmony can cause even further friction.  The more goals and values you have in common with a potential partner, the smoother your relationship is likely to be.<br>  <br>  As you're working on your doctorate, it sounds like education is a value for you, but that it may not be for the people you've been dating.  This is likely to cause friction in the future.  It's not shallow, this is reality.  Sharing a life with someone is much different than anything else in life.  It is not bad that you want education, because as you said, it's something you value.  It's good that you recognize this now.<br>  <br>  Because you're working on your doctorate, an advanced degree, a good question to ask yourself is why the last two people you've dated have had very low educational backgrounds in relation to your own.  Do you think this tells you anything about you?  What about them has attracted you?  The people we are attracted to are sometimes a signal to things we don't realize about ourselves.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	not bad at all!!! you have to find someone that has the same goals and ambitions as you so you both support each other!! how fun would it have been to "support the family" as the other lazy jerk said!!! Nuh Huh!!<br>  its Ok to look for people as intellectual and interesting as you, its not judgmental just important to your values and interests|`|LDe9yzCKaa	no... i think i would be the same... i would want my husband to be responsible. I want a secure future... its not that i have a problem w/ people w/o college degrees... its just what my mindset is.... i know its not wrong
O0udlwfwaa	Go out to eat.<br>  Skating,<br>  Walking...like in a park<br>  Go to the mall together<br>  Go over a friends house since u cant go over each others house.<br>  ...hmm...ice skating....idk|`|ikoO9EBmaa	no mall, thats torcher for the guy<br>  <br>  go do something that interest men<br>  here are some examples:<br>  pokemon<br>  running long distences<br>  or lifting weights|`|pbPe614Raa	go to the zoo or the mall|`|aC6O7vlNaa	amusement park<br>  street fair<br>  <br>  well, wherever you can goof off and have fun.
GeruGGOQaa	Yep.  They got married and had a daughter last I heard.|`|BUET39wmaa	christ sorry man that is rough.  my hub fooled around on me for sex only though.  he wasn't emotionally involved and now we are working things out as we were both at fault for allowing it to go this far.|`|wKzH60Xlaa	Yes, this happened to me...    The cheating spouse part but not the leaving part. However my brother in law did it - twice!  Wow - it can really be devastating and throw your journey in life for a loop.    My husband cheated on me.  We had 3 kids and it killed me.  We made it through but it wasn't easy.  But there are things that I learned.  I did nothing to do bring this on.  ONce I got my head on straight I realized I needed to be there for my kids.  I also realized that my life did not depend on my husband and that I can stand on my own 2 feet.  I really found the strength when I needed it.    Your wife will eventually learn that he has dirty underwear and bad breath just like the next person.  She's literally living in a fantasy world that will eventually come down to reality sometime soon.  Relationships don't often last when they start in deceit like this. Good luck and embrace every day you have with your kids.  You will find the strength as I did.  You can email me if you want to talk more.    Take care.|`|ba428f6f619bfc67fa65e92c90d4c839aa	Don't listen the the "family 1st" idiot.  Yes, my wife cheated on me as well.  No warnings, no little indicators,  We were having some troubles but nothing big but instead of trying to work them out she just went out and cheated.  This in not the girl that I married.  She changed after we married.|`|TVz2UoOyaa	yah! but he realized that he's wrong and not to do that again..or else i'll leave him....|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Yep, he divorced me (after 24 years!) and married her. She was a co-worker.    Hold your head up, you didn't do anything wrong, SHE did. Just be a great dad to your kids, get a divorce, and move forward. And if she gets tired of him and wants to come back, tell her NO WAY. Good luck to you.|`|VUvfWG7Eaa	Yep been there, mine walked out on me when I was laying in the emergency room of a hospital receiving last rights, my cardiologist was in tears, my boss was a wreck, and she walked out to go and meet her boyfriend, and to make it even worse she took him to my home and did the nasty in my bed. She never worked a day in her life with me, she lived in the malls, and drove a Porsche , when I recovered and went home she stabbed me three times for no reason while my friend and his wife watched in horror, and believe it or not I was the one in hand cuffs and bleeding out, while the drama queen told her tale. Thank God for witnesses, so if you think you have it rough, consider yourself lucky she just walked out !|`|ma6Re8B1aa	NO I would have known better not to marry someone who was capable of that???|`|OBCvewW2aa	Yeah, me too.    Don't let the bitterness get ya down.|`|ze7xiJwTaa	My husband moved his (19 years younger) girlfriend into my house (she split with her h/b and 'needed our help'). He continued the affair for months before I found out and left. It was the most disgusting display of betrayal I could ever imagine. A year after our split they are still together and she now lives in my old house with him. Years of therapy...years.   Sorry about your wife. That sucks.|`|JugLXUbmaa	u are seemingly a matured man - this is surely rough but u seem calm and not overly bitter in your language.    perhaps deep in your heart u must be relieved to not have her around anymore - someone who ditches husband overnight and worse still kids - omg.    i'm sorry for your experience. Hope you find someone nice and worthy of u next (this wasn't your question lol but...)|`|2sF0qPjBaa	No,but I am sorry for your situation. Those two are both cold hearted and probably deserve eachother.|`|AA10178644	Yes it did and my husband also left his kids.  He was gone 3 weeks when he realized that he made a huge mistake and came home only after agreeing to counseling.  We now have a better marriage now than we ever have, so it can be done but it takes work.  Feel free to contact me if you'd like some advise.  Good luck.|`|8tVuKw4Zaa	Never had it happen ..but they say the other half is the last to find out
GPakfvINaa	You're old enough to make your own decisions (you're what, 20 or 21 years old?).  She made a mistake and it is absolutely NOT your place to tell the husband.<br>  <br>  I understand that you are dealing with a lot of guilt and may not be able to move past this situation without taking some kind of action.  There are a few options that might help, like writing about it, talking to a trusted friend or adviser about it, or actually talking to her about it.  You may find out if you talk to her that she has great remorse about the situation.<br>  <br>  Infidelity in a marriage is very serious, and although you feel very guilty now, you may find that if you were to tell her husband, you might feel even more guilty for interfering in their marriage and their relationship.  It is their marriage and their live, actually, and you have a lot of opportunity to move past this and have a great fulfilling life!<br>  <br>  It has only been a month, so keep trying to move past this.  Remember that YOU were not unfaithful, and therefore, you did not violate anyone's trust or respect.  You need to think about all the things your life has in store for you and think about this as a learning experience.<br>  <br>  I wish you luck!  In a few years, you will probably be able to look back on this situation with a very different perspective - one that won't keep you up at night!|`|AA11098273	What did you do with your little brother while you were "Hot for Teacher"?? Obviously, if this is all true. You aren't the first fly in her web, if it was that easy then she's been fooling around a while. Ask God to forgive you and be smarter than your "journal" says you are!|`|NRBa2LNmaa	I don't think you should call her husband, you would feel even worse knowing you broke up her family. Just relax & be grateful you got to have sex with an older woman, your former teacher, how many guys can say that..lol|`|Sua2AJIvaa	I would talk to her about what happened, it might be awkward, but in the end it will be better. Apologize for what you did, and try to convince her to come clean to her husband.|`|iM67HPE2aa	Telling her husband would make YOU feel better, not her. You need to come to terms with what you did. If she wants to tell her husband, it is her responsibility to do so. Back off.|`|fKyc1ccUaa	your teachers a floozy. hookin' up with 20 year olds... walkin' talkin' jesus.|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Liar.|`|RPhla0R7aa	No don't let her do that, if she chooses to. You on the other hand just stay away from her.|`|GVtrVXDkaa	thats sick|`|F3LBgfvwaa	No, don't do that. Then you would be helping her cheat AND causing drama for her family, and that's messed up. Just stay away from married women if you want to do the right thing.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	dont tell him!! its not in your hands to ruin or make their marriage.  Talk to HER and tell her  how  you feel... tell her you feel bad and that you dont want to do that again, and let her decide what SHE does with her marriage!!!<br>  dont step in!! talk to her to make yourself feel better, but dont you dare go into their marriage! its NOT your place.|`|6OzEsanAaa	hahahahahahhahahaha!!<br>  what the heck!! wow<br>  <br>  yeahh i think the best thing to do is to actually tell her husband because<br>  how would you like it if ur wife was fooling around? wouldnt you like to know?|`|a1pmr73vaa	Moral thing to do yes tell him<br>  judgemental thing  to do..He will beat you and there will be drama.<br>  <br>  your choice really.|`|xnhwmontaa	DONT CALL HER HUSBAND! LET HER DO IT,|`|Cpp1LddVaa	Absolutely do NOT go blab to her husband.  Your teacher will tell him herself when she's ready. You know nothing about their  marriage and don't want to cause any trouble.<br>  <br>  As for feeling bad, it takes "two to tango."  Sometimes these things happen.<br>  <br>  What's going on with your teacher now?  If you have feelings for her, you should talk to her, be a grown up about "what happened," and be a friend to her rather than kicking her to the curb like a used kleenex.<br>  <br>  Very often, life's surprises are not half as bad as all the idiotic behavior that comes afterwards -- like a team sport athlete who makes a huge mistake but then can't "get over it" and makes three more mistakes right afterward.<br>  <br>  You're in for a little "dysphoria" (opposite of euphoria) as you process all of this, but hey, the toughest part of being a grownup is managing the ambiguity -- no good guys or bad guys, no black and white, just people and "shades of gray" that resemble commuting to work in the fog -- you'll get to that eventually too.<br>  <br>  Good luck and best wishes.|`|bbcdb7567db47a2d8a81e3abaec851e3aa	No, no, no.  She shouldn't have come onto you and what you did you're already beating yourself up for it enough.  It would just complicate the situation.  Just let it be a lesson that you won't repeat.|`|AA11122479	even if you are of legal age she took advantage of you. don't get involved in that drama. move on and keep in mind that she was the adult in the situation and should have made better choices.|`|CQsD09D6aa	You already graduated.

2jyrDNljaa	Yupp we've all been there. They probably have a reason and they just don't wsant to hurt your feelings by telling you or maybe you've just changed from the way you were when you first became friends. Don't worry about it friends come and friends go. If they're friends worth keeping they won't leave you.|`|c25f8fadf50d9a4962ff785057c8a552aa	well this has happened to me, a couple of times before...<br>  ususally a friend dumps you because they feel they cant be a great friend to you like you are to them. They might feel like they let you down, and you are too good for the. So they feel embarrassed, and in order for them to see you succeed they have to let u go.,|`|rcy9sPV3aa	It happened to be a week ago. I was really upset but then I confronted them. I said: Are you guys mad at me? If you are, I'm really sorry. What have I done?<br>  <br>  And then they started telling me what I've done. And they didn't hang want me in their gang. So I was by myself for one break time and at lunchtime they decided to forgive me. <br>  <br>  :)|`|eCalss9laa	i've had this happpen.<br>  turns out there was arumor going around that i had flirted with my friends boyfriend and instead of telling me she just stopped talking to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  please help me!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuGVi87.ZC7qdltFlAc9qaXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220210325AAtvqDy">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>
EKj4PH76aa	OMG!i know what you mean.|`|uuHDQr1paa	It seems that way.  You are right.  It seems very monotonous most of the time.|`|Tqof0Frnaa	If you let your life become a routine, then yeah, it'll get boring. <br>  Do something new every now and then with the people you live with. Don't rely on the t.v. for entertainment, you can do other things like take a walk or go window shopping or bike riding.<br>  <br>  That's what I would do. +]|`|hsyI1DxDaa	I SO can relate. I'm 15, I barely go out (my friends live 15 miles away..) all I do is the same bullcrap everyday. Dad plays PS3, mum watches TV, I sit here doing the same thing I did yesterday. And the day before..and the day before..<br>  <br>  Arrrgh. It's gotten me so frustrated.|`|Uv7onQaQaa	dont you work/and or go to school. As boring as homework can be, it definitely takes up a lot of time for me. Go out with friends, or maybe get a hobby like running or play a sport.|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Find hobbies that you do enjoy them.<br>  <br>  Fortunately for me I love watching movies, playing video games and using the internet. So I'm basically set.|`|k9IFYBDQaa	you say it is boring, try it. go without tv, internet and video games for a month, it will be extremely difficult but if you do i guarantee you will find something that makes life interesting. <br>  <br>  <br>  p.s. <br>  <br>  as an amendment to this dare i will allow you to use the internet strictly for emailing purposes.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	Your life is what you make it out to be. It will definitely be boring if you sit at home all day. You need to go out with friends and just do things out side of the family. You have to have a girlfriend and so do things with her. As cruel as it sounds you need to get a life. Get into some sort of Hobby. A great hobby is digital photography. Your only limit is the one you place on yourself.|`|PFPvvHEgaa	For some people.<br>  But that's just growing up.<br>  You'll have to deal.<br>  D:<br>  Maybe you should get a fascinating job.<br>  With like celebrities and..<br>  Yeah.<br>  Or maybe become a magician.<br>  Just do something fun.<br>  My brother's 22.<br>  He's going through the same thing, really.<br>  I think..|`|kiihLiLvaa	Its always depend, I mean if u look other people life; they usually enjoyed.

12d54aae44a56fa45d6d9f5011d6c253aa	Younger ---  Have time to enjoy your elder years with your husband/wife.  You also have more engery to run around after your kids.  Eventually you kids can support you.  :)   You get to meet your grandkids and your great grandkids!!    Later---  You have more experience in life.  You may have already went on vacations or whatever other goals you wanted w/ husband/wife.  You have more confidence in your abilites as an adult.  You may have a nicer home and can spoil your kids more than when you could if younger.    It's a flip flop!    Add-->  I still think "Later" you'll meet grandkids but, w/ younger you will probably be able to enjoy longer...mathmatically.    I don't agree w/ the 25 rule.  I mean I guess it's a good "rule of thumb" but, at 18 they can move out and get married....that's a big difference!  You never know when your kids will be ready to move out and start a family.  So, you maybe able to enjoy your grandkids and great grandkids just the same!|`|woOeYFrEaa	I wanted to be done having kids by the time I was 30, but I wasn't even married yet.  I just got married at 31 and plan to wait until I'm 34 to have our first child because we want some time as a married couple before we add children to the mix.    I know having waited later, I've been able to have fun and travel and do lots of things I couldn't have done if I'd already had children.  I feel like I'm more mature, more patient, and more relaxed than I was in my 20s but I also know that my risks of birth defects are higher and that pregnancy and late night feedings are going to be harder on my body than if I were younger.    The younger parents get their children out of the house and can travel and "play" in their 40s.  My husband I played in our 20s and 30s and will be retired by the time we get our kids off to college.    I think either way works.|`|FfCpx6mLaa	Younger, grow up and relate better with kids.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Younger - to have enough physical energy and sharp mentality to keep up after the kids.  But not teens younger - I mean young twenties.|`|HOAQtDDzaa	Younger...I always tell people to add 25 to their present age.  This is how old you will be before that child leaves your house to begin their own life.  That is the first child, subsequent children need to be recalculated.    If you get pregnant for your first child at 25, you will be 50 before they are grown and gone.  If you have another child every 2 years and you have 4 children, you will be 56 when they are grown.    Now you will have a chance to have grandchildren.    But, if you start this whole process at 35 or 40, the chances of you living to enjoy grandchildren shall be slim.|`|PFTGH7Z6aa	Coming from both sides of the coin, I feel I can answer your question.  I had a child at 23 and it was too young for me.  Though I was happily married and felt I was settled down enough to start a family, I was not.  My friends were out partying, jetting off on exciting vacations, moving to new places and getting better job opportunities, had more disposable income.  I had none of those things and though I was blessed with a healthy, happy child, I felt I had cheated myself out of my youth.  My parents, otoh, had me when they were older, around 40, and that also was too old.  The generation gap was huge and there was very little in the way of understanding or relating.  Society changed so fast from when they were children to when I was growing up, they had a hard time understanding what I was even learning in school.  The gap will only get worse as technology changes.  You can only know for yourself when is the right time to start a family.  If you think your carefree days are done for now, then do it.  If not, wait a little longer.|`|qegWdsNLaa	I don't want kids, but if I was going to have them and there were no other practical barriers, I'd rather have them younger.  Not incredibly young, but maybe starting in my late 20s or early 30s rather than, say, late 30s.  I'd rather not leave it to the last moment because the younger you start, the more energy you're likely to have when the kids are growing up.  I'd hate to be dealing with raising a teenager at 55.|`|AuKKjaxaaa	I was 31 when my son was born.  I'll be nearly 50 when he graduates high school.  I'm okay with that.  My sister is 41 now and trying to conceive.  If she gets pregnant today, she'll be 60 when her child graduates.    Will you have the energy to deal with a teenager when you're 45?  55?    Something to consider.    The other consideration is that, like it or not, your children will become more important than your spouse, for both parties.  It strikes me as odd that people get married to have kids to come between you and strain the marriage, but that's how it goes.|`|2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Get married at a younger age - this way, if I get it wrong, I still have time to correct the mistake.    I don't want to have kids, but if I was to have a child, it would be at an older age.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	i hate how young dedicated answers get thumbs down!! i mean kids arent burdens!! they are blessings and if you think kids are burden its better not to have them and take the necessary precautions!!  that being said...  younger!! so i can relate to them and dedicate my youthfulness to them!! well im 23 and have 2 kids and happily married, this is the life i chose... money is a problem like in everyday life but i love this!! there is nothing better than this... FOR ME!!|`|vz0tsPStaa	yes.  i want a family.|`|EeThBc3Zaa	I went with younger, on the theory that I'd be able to keep up with the kid better and be a fun mom and it'd be easier on my body.  That would've all worked out ok if I hadn't settled for someone I wasn't crazy about in my rush to get married.|`|lGSUToFQaa	well my hubby is 21, i'm 28 i have an 8 yr old and we have a 7 month old, money has never been an issue with us, so i'd say we'd keep it the same ages, enough maturity we know what we want out of life and how to get it, and young enough to grow up with our kids, me i'm 8 yrs older than my daughter, and he is 21 yrs older than our son|`|I5wje0J1aa	No. I want to live my life.|`|W1aYIF71aa	I would want later, when my life is over anyway.|`|GeruGGOQaa	After 25.  I would like to enjoy some time with my partner before such a large chunk of it would need to be dedicated to our children because once they're grown and out of the house it will be just the two of us again so we had better still have something else in common other than we have kids together.|`|f02e697306fa9b0bd6517818970ff8daaa	Have them at a younger age so I can have the energy and be there for them.  When your kids are in their teens and you are retiring, that is not an ideal mix. when the leave for college and you are in your mid 40s (life begins @ 40) you are good.|`|ByUS0k8waa	I got married at 20 yrs old but I was very wild. Im glad I waited til I was ready to settle down and more mature. Honestly my husband and I were both REALLY wild when we were younger and now we are 23 and 24 and we are the most responsible people we know. Im glad we found each other and got married when we did. We truly love each other and that makes all the difference.|`|zdpp7cubaa	Get married younger, but have kids later. I think it's important to have a few years where it's just you and your spouse. (what me and my fiance plan to do) So you can adjust to being married and just enjoy each other before you have kids. Also, make sure your marriage is going to work before dragging kids into it.

919e353f09cc286cad0b78b0c0dbc843aa	If he drives a conventional with a sleeper; a cool gift I received once was a flannel sheet set with a handmade quilt that my girlfriend stitched together herself. ( I suspect her mother helped her ) I could see the little notes she sewed into it everytime I laid down to rest and it made me think of her.    If he doesn't have a sleeper you could get a midsized cooler and fill it with all of his favorite munchies and soft-drinks. Not having to stop along the way to grab some food saves a lot of time and gets him home to you even sooner. Good Luck and have a Happy Valentines Day.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	My Suggestions:    Handmade Card  Valentine Shirt|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	remember in the old days when guys/girls made mixed tapes-why not mixed cd of songs. songs that mean something to both of you. so when he's on the road he can pop it in & think of you.|`|3tHTZ2lKaa	a sombrero!!  -a hat.    simon!  haha good luckk!  =]|`|9p9DDRSnaa	how about a massager for his seat in his rig?  they make some that plug into his auxillary plug...is it a sleeper cab?  maybe you could get him a small tv or something for it.|`|GSl7Syspaa	How about a "truckers" cap....
yezbmlaKaa	First of all, you deserve to be treated like a the awesome diva you are! No one deserves to be treated badly because you called things off with him. <br>  <br>  Secondly, this guy just sounds like trouble. You're entitled to your feelings - whether that be that you don't feel like you have chemistry with this guy or not. He's moved on, so should you! You DESERVE better than this guy. The reason he doesn't want to see you is because he has found someone else and, to be completely honest, he is just not that into you. Move on. <br>  <br>  Here's what you should do: Get on your hottest outfit, go out with some girls, and have a great time! Get this guy out of your mind! You deserve a guy that you have total chemistry with that isn't going to make you feel guilty for breaking up with him. Go have fun hot stuff!!|`|rJJKUJpaaa	I think he feel crushed after what you did and he still hasn't let it go so I'd say to give him space.|`|oTVWgTqQaa	I think may be u r wrong but don't worry live in present and forget ur <br>  past whatever it was don't Look at back .
qegWdsNLaa	Tell her sooner rather than later.  The longer you hold it in, the more it will build up and the more likely there will be a big creepy gap between your feelings about her and her feelings bout you.  Be prepared for her maybe not feeling the same way and if that's the case, be cool about it.  Also be prepared that things might be awkward for a while if it doesn't go the way you want, but if you're totally easygoing and understanding about it, it'll get better.  Either way, when you tell her, try not to make a huge deal about it.  Overwrought love poems skywritten by airplanes with marriage offers simulcast on jumbotrons at major sporting events is not the way to go in this situation.  Be honest and sweet and open to listening to what she has to say, but keep it simple.|`|5d9211d38d6935bc0d08850b222ec434aa	Are you married? If you are, and you have fallen for a best friend whom is not your spouse, then you'd do well to keep it to yourself and move along and stay faithful to your vows.      HOWEVER, If you are single, then where's the shame coming from?   It can easily happen, falling in love with your best friend...and it can produce the most wonderful relationships! If you are unattached, then you should really objectively look at your friendship with her-does she seem interested? Is she single as well? Then if so, take her out for dinner, or somewhere where you are both fairly comfortable-say, a hobby you both share, and tell her what your heart is feeling. Put it out there. You never know-she might feel the same! If so, congrats! If she doesn't, at least you were honest, and hopefully you won't lose this friendship.|`|nJ33E233aa	Be ready for that bestfriend to RUN!|`|GeruGGOQaa	Go ahead and tell her, but brace yourself for the good ole, Oh, that's so sweet but I only like you as a friend, line.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Hire a mariachi band and sing to her at her bedroom window.|`|wiv8Ctmaaa	Tell her what is on your mind. Be ready for anything, because you may be rejected or accepted. These opportunities come once in a lifetime!|`|CWgJ7Yyxaa	As Jason said, be careful here.  Remember...Men and women think and act differently.     If you go ahead and tell her that you feel differently for her now, -(and especially  if she has always considered you as a  good friend,only )- you might ruin the relationship you've had so far. Be ready for the consequences.    She might be happy about it; but then again, she might not.     And if she is like most girls, she will feel uncomfortable seeing you after you have spilled the beans. ( Many times women have a clear division in their head...friends are one thing; and romantic interests are another thing.) We feel guilty when we know a guy likes us as more than friends...and we don't feel the same way.    Good luck.|`|31d0a24439ecffe20e04cb85a1238aecaa	If you are both "available" then why don't you ask her out on a date.  If she refuses, then you know you have a lot of work to do to make it more than friends.  Don't confess your "love" for her now - wait till you have dated for a while.
rYhm4LN1aa	i myself dont believe that a male n female can only be friends.     dont tell her you "love" her but make it obvious that you have an interest in her. pay her compliments, pay more attention to her, put your arm around her, flirt but in a messing around way.    Valentines day coming up, why not ask her to be yours??    u only live once, what do u have to lose? plus u never know, she could be keen for you too.    if shes a good friend it wont mess with the friendship.      DONT listen to the people who are saying not to tell her, they dont know anything.|`|k6DAgwqyaa	Ok so your in love with her right i know it can be hard telling her you like her but if youre not really sure of telling her how you feel you can figure out if she likes you or who she likes ok so if she likes you :    * when youre together she will grab her hair   *most of the time she will agree with you   * always when youre online shell say hi   * shes always kind of awkward around u   * shes always wondering were you are     but anyways i think you should ask her out with a cute letter and yummy chocolates XD      hope this helped   good luck|`|NmUZ4ltQaa	if she doesn't have the same feelings telling her in words could jeopardize the friendship and balance of the relationship. if she does have the same feelings then great, if not and you admit yours to her, her perception of you will be altered as the guy who wants more. sometimes girls will use that to their advantage, sometimes not.    is it worth risking your friendship? consider telling her in a way that doesn't use words. girls often appreciate the unspoken subtext of a situation manifesting itself through actions rather than words.    when you guys are joking around, briefly grab her elbow or put your hand on her back, then take it away. does she reciprocate these kinds of physical gestures? if so that's a really good sign. gradually begin to escalate touch when appropriate, but remember to start small, elbow, back, then move on to more erogenous zones: thigh, neck.  if you find she is pinging you back with similar touch i'd say she's into you more than a friend.  at this point escalate to a simple kiss, not a makeout tonguedown thing (yet). do not ask if you can kiss her. when you two are having a good time, alone and she is pinging you back with those touches i talked about, look into her eyes and kiss her. don't do it for long and you want to be the first one to pull back and you can say something like "whoa, slow down there" and smile, grab her shoulder for a sec so she knows you're joking.      those are the two paths i see. what i mean to say is try and find out if she likes you before admitting your feelings to her. the best way to find out is with actions like i described above, words can complicate things and there's time for talks like that after you two are more physical.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	Write her a love letter with your blood.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	You will get the ones who'll say don't do it but listen to an old man. I married my best friend. When I think of the years I wasted without her it makes me sick. Tell her, even if she doesn't act on it now, she'll never forget.|`|4RiziMD0aa	take it slow and instead of blurting out "i love you" ask her out on a date. say do you wanna hang out me and you sometime and then see how it goes from there. you'll know she considers you more than i friend if she says yes and then after a few dates let her know you like her and you wanna make her your gf. good luck!|`|g8bgfY0Aaa	This happened to me too. First you should find out if she feels the same way about you. If she does, go for it. If not, the feeling will pass like it did for me. It's not worth ruining the friendship over. Good luck!  xoxo|`|zxa2fjpyaa	If you want to tell her, sit her down and just say it. You can't really rehearse this because once you're on the spot you'll forget everything. Just say what comes from the heart. I was in the same situation a few months back. I felt so much better to get it off my chest and we are still good friends even though i got rejected =[ haha.|`|0JgenGPtaa	if you're the shy guy, write her a letter, but make sure YOU personally hand it to her. or you can try giving her a call. i think the best approach is talk to her one on one. tell her how you feel. i may be the best thing you'll ever do.     i could imagine how it feels to tell the Best friend that you like her. don't be ashamed, at least you will find out how she feels about you.     you don't want to miss the chance to tell her how you feel; you don't want to regret not telling her.    just be yourself when you tell her. speak from you heart. i hope things turn out well. good Luck:)|`|q4V7Zi0Haa	DO NOT tell her unless your sure she feels the same way. Usually your friendship will come to an end or be very awkward if you tell her and she DOESNT feel the same way. Get one of your other friends to casually bring it up and find out for you.|`|AA10911598	Speak up loud and clear  about your heartfelt emotions. Could work out wonderfully for you both.  Valentines day is coming up soon........perhaps some flowers would be in order?|`|470dc9e84094d2130c1ec379a4271d28aa	Just work up the nerve and tell her. Gotta take the chance. Thank goodness my husband had the courage to tell me after 2 years of friendship because we're coming up on our 8 year anniversary and I couldn't be happier.
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	if your interested in HIM just call, tell him u were thinking about him and wondered what he had been doing lately. maybe he doesn't think that u are interested.|`|IA5uBGFkaa	Just call him up and say some like you popped in my head and I started thinking about you so I thought I would call and see how you have been and what's going on in life.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	you're in high school, or middle school?  Are you married?|`|RPhla0R7aa	call|`|Eug52iQDaa	Calling him is a little like stalking at this point.  You do run into him once in a while.  Wait for the opportunity and then ask him out to lunch!  It's safe, easy :)  Answer the door next time.  Remember honesty in any relationship or it's simply not going to work.  DO know that this isn't your last chance.  Life has a wonderful way of working out just as it should.  The reality is that he is a person, just like you.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|upGWkkyQaa	no . U don't have to say anything . If he wants you he'll sit out on that porch swing and tell you what he wants you to hear.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	why is this in the marriage and divorce board... it should be in toddler and preschooler YOU IMMATURE CHILD!!!<br>  get over him!! if you didnt answer the door when he rang, why would you call him, just so he can hear you breath!!!!???

lGSUToFQaa	dude, let me say, i go to school full time, am a landlord to 15 houses in another state, have an 8yr old, and a 7 month old and a 21 yr old hubby who works 60 hrs a week and is in school, suffocated, well now grow up and quit sleeping, you can do that when you're dead, probably from suffocation from a gf.|`|OBCvewW2aa	They don't make 'em like they used to.  Nowadays everybody is whining about working and going to school as if they're the first ones ever to do it.  The key is caffeine.  Stop sleeping so much and you'll have more time.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Maybe you need to put off any relationships with the opposite sex until after you graduate. I mean you can't blame her for feeling the way she does.|`|iUYTvsPEaa	My best advice is communication. Talk to someone about how you're feeling. Your best friends will understand and give you space, and if your GF loves you, so will she. Find something to do if you have the time - read, crossword, something to clear your head and get you into a good space.|`|faT4MyVkaa	After reading your story, it sounds like your gf is more serious than you are, because I never saw where you made time for her. You make time for two friends, but you are complaining about her and life. Like someone else said, you aren't the first, suck it up and get through it. I worked like 30-35 hours, took 12 credit hours, commuted 90 minutes daily, and oh I was married and we lived on our own.|`|zjuMrDmGaa	Why can't she be there at the same time as your friends? Do they not get along? It seems this would solve part of your problem.|`|ntfAzDGKaa	Be yourself.    MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|vz0tsPStaa	i'm with the internet hate machine.    it's not going to get better.
JyEoCBrJaa	Some not all younger men are way more mature than older guys. I say if you like him and he treats you right etc...to continue the relationship. No need to end a relationship b/c of age difference.<br>  <br>  "Age Ain't Nothing But a Number" - Aaliyah|`|8pw8qDjPaa	its possible... its a fact that women mature faster then men... but at some point they catch up and equal out (maybe) but hey, everyone is different. so the 23 year old female might be a lot more mature then one 21 year old male... but just fine with the other 21 year old male. <br>  <br>  Take into consideration though that at 23 women are starting to get a lil more serous about wanting to settle down and start a family... i mean, not exactly, but its in the back of their minds. Most men at 21 (and women for that matter) are still in college and at that party stage. But everyone is different. So who knows.|`|zwdGBrUZaa	well it depends<br>  i mean a lot of things have changed over a short period of time<br>  maybe boys realize they gotta man up more i guess|`|6OzEsanAaa	age is just a number!<br>  if you like him! then go ahead! =]|`|74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	You can not base maturity on age. Its true that females are usually more mature than males but it also depends on what they have been through and had to over come during their life. I mean say you had a 23 yr female who always had what ever she wanted handed to her on a silver spoon she really wouldn't be all that mature in the real world, then standing next to her you have a 21 yr male who has been raising his three brothers and sisters since he was sixteen because his mom is an alcoholic and dad a junkie. He will have a lot more maturity. Every person should be judged for who they are not how old or where they come from or what color. If you like this man then go for it the first guy is right age is only a number. And yours is only +2/-2 (which ever way you want to look at it) Just don't pass up something possibly great bc of the traditional approach to dating isn't there. Live life to its fullest and try to never have regrets! Good luck|`|4taGl3Z1aa	Well i think that all guys are immature their whole lives but thats in our blood, also there are osme guys rare but there are some that are mature at a very young age and those are the ones that have dealt with alot of things in their life and those things just made them stronger and more mature about the way they look at life and well you8 have a well rounded man that you like, you should go for it because it might be your turn to show that you are mature enough for his maturity or somehting like that haha i may have typed it in a confusing way well hope this helps and good luck|`|9UQlhzitaa	yes  but you never know until you pick his brain awhile and see<br>  <br>  most guys don't start to be able to think at the same level you women do until their 30 or older or never; really it depends on the guy but as a general rule no but he may surprise you<br>  <br>  Honey i have not seen to many gentlemen come out of the younger crowds in some time about 1 in a 100 so i have found with all the different people i meet. fyi  I get weird looks because i'm a gentleman from some of the younger lady's but with the 40 or older lady's i get smiles and warm greetings so go figure that one out|`|Hd7tFHN7aa	your right about guys, most of the time.  Men thing about sex more then food at that age.  If your around a guy that is not a hole, and your ok with him, enjoy him and his many talents.<br>  <br>  most of the time it is the difference of 2 to 4 years until the mid to late 20's, but what are stats but numbers and facts anyway and most of the time it says with % chance of being wrong.<br>  <br>  enjoy,<br>  John|`|4sTDtz7kaa	I really don't think age matters when both of you are into each other. If he makes you feel better that the older guys you have been dating, then go for it!|`|OSSRoUs2aa	There is nothing wrong with the guy being younger... go with what your heart says... It will ALWAYS show you the way. =]<br>  Good Luck!!|`|xYacZrTLaa	girls mature way faster than boys|`|Lf7JcWQoaa	mayb|`|5VHWy0Ggaa	i wouldn't say that a 23 year old woman would be far more mature. it all depends on the two people, because a 23 year old woman could be less mature than the 21 year old male.. as i said it all depends on the people, their experiences in life, and where they are at. if you two are kind of heading in the same direction, and he's got his stuff together... i would say to go for it and follow your heart. girls mature faster then guys, but some guys are mature at this age too. i guess i would say to give it time... he will show his true self eventually, and then you can decide what you want to do|`|vtm3dCaVaa	I think it is not going to work hunny, you need a man older than you, and at 21 he is just experiencing being a man, legally able to drink and enter adult parties.<br>  <br>  I dated an older woman. sex was great but we did not really connect. I think the man has to be the same age or at least older than the woman.<br>  <br>  But go ahead and give it a try.|`|Uu8ro6J1aa	It all depends on the person.  I was fairly mature at 21, but a lot of college guys aren't, from my experience.  I've also known women older than me who are more immature.  There's nothing wrong with dating someone younger, if that's what you want to do.|`|LDe9yzCKaa	i know what you mean... i had talked about this w/ a friend of mine and she said something that made quite a bit of sense to me... her philosophy is that maybe younger guys know that older girls go into the relationship w/ the fear of the guy being immature;therefore, they try 2x as hard to make sure that they dont go wrong. but dont let the age be a crucial factor... if he makes you feel important and loved... go for it :) good luck!|`|eA817mGoaa	it really depends on the person. some act their age, some dont..
ITHucEQmaa	well it depends a guy cant have baggy jeans like there ghetto there have a lip piercing. But if there emo/punk then skinny jeans and lip piercing looks good. I think guys look hotter with a tongue piercing.|`|L5ioX6r1aa	Not really skinny jeans, because only skinny guys can pull it off and I don't like skinny guys, I like built guys :).    Never dated a guy with lip piercings. So I dunno...|`|2vH6VktWaa	Baggy Jeans  No Peircing|`|Molu004zaa	I HATE that look. Way too 'scene' and childish if you ask me. I prefer REAL men who wear REAL clothes - not girl jeans :| aha|`|ORNW7Ud1aa	Gayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy|`|d76Mz5c0aa	I love emo guys  they wear tight girli jeans  tight shirts  they always want to talk about feelings  and life itself  some are gay but thats cute too...  the boys with jet black hair  smokey blue eyes  snake bites nose and or eyebrow rings  are so smexy!!!  >.>     tehe c ya l8rz girli  hope me helped? lol|`|tjFcfI9Aaa	skinny jeans no piercing|`|a1uoxczTaa	baggy jeans, get rid of the piercing.|`|E5n8tRKoaa	skinny jeans and the piercing is hella sexy.|`|1rcibKjmaa	in prefer the same as you. Not so crazy about the snake bite though.    But i don't like piercing on myself, but he could do what he wants to him. Its his body.|`|JuqxbJ3Daa	Guys with somewhat baggie jeans, hate the skinny jeans.|`|HRNKJUYuaa	Baggy jeans are so hot XD  some people think that skinny jeans look better because you'll be able to see how 'big' you are through that tight demin,,,  but   you'll just look inbelieveabley gay :P  NO lip peircing|`|lUSknAQtaa	Ummm skinny jeans should only be worn by females...Im into a manly male...not a girly male...take care|`|L8FJUBQnaa	well every one has different tastes in guys but i will say skinny jeans with 1 lip peirceing  omg they are so hot even with their hair is cut to the side and it is dyed black ish or so i love the punk guys but if they are wearing skinny jeans you got to be skinny i hate the fat boys that try to get away with the skinny jeans they all look like crap when they doo because you see thier fat role over the jeans it is so gross i hate it but holly crap skinny jeans skinny guys and lip ring baby|`|3203c9731cb9bf893f22dac9386a7f85aa	Personally I like skinny jeans on girls......    So baggy it is for the guys.....    As far as piercing goes, I hate when you kiss someone with a piercing, as it makes a kiss impassionate.......    But what matters is your opinion, right????????
2jJyvqMqaa	well shes your ex soo maybe teddy bear flowers choclates|`|bYxJleK7aa	dont worry about valentines day, its just a stupid halmark holiday your going to buy a card or something for her for like 10 or more dollars and then shes just giong to throw it away|`|H6MT8Z8caa	a lil teddy bear or a card or somthing [:|`|FIV3ClQsaa	diamond pendant and a bunch of red roses.|`|0JV3tQm8aa	My Suggestions:    Handmade Card  Valentine Teddy Bear|`|EHY3FnAmaa	I dont give my Exs Vday gifts so sorry cant help you with that.|`|vwoqIUR6aa	give her some flowers or some candy...really just something simple.|`|FurFahkEaa	A burger glued to a boxers glove.|`|prW1i0vzaa	You can never go wrong with jewelry!
mLdlFhyqaa	Trust, because I know that they probably are doing it for the best.|`|CvFajKPUaa	they should be the same person, if you can't trust the one you love then you need to make better choices in the future<br>  <br>  losing trust is horrible, most of the time, if not all of the time it is the person who is doing the trusting who is making the mistake, they assumed the other could be trusted when they shouldn't have<br>  <br>  either or both completely suck, I cheated on a girl who both loved and trusted me one time and I think I felt worse than she did, I let her down and hurt her, I kinda felt like a dirt bag, won't ever do it again especially since I put a $60K ring on my girls finger a few months ago and just bought her a new Denali and my house and condo are in both our names|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	It really depends on how they are hurting you. I wouldn't want to get hurt by either but it does depend on how your being hurt. If it's a lie but it is to protect your feelings it is one thing but if it is something like cheating it is another thing.|`|7LDLiBYCaa	i would rather be hurt by the one i trust<br>  <br>  if i was in love and they hurt me it would be hard for me to recover. i think it would destroy me<br>  <br>  but the one i trust is trusted for a reason. they could always get another chance|`|t4ebT9araa	it seems to me the person you love the most should be the person you trust the most. because love and trust go hand in hand. at least in my book. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmT15EEd6m_saiBlJWp2.1jsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220211712AA2h6em">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|d3icrU62aa	interesting question...I guess the person I trust the most cause just b/c I trust a person doesn't mean I love them but the people I love the most are the ones I greatly trust so that'd be a double whammy|`|tK5swgX1aa	I guess the one I love the most, if I don't trust them the most then I won't be hurt as bad.|`|kPKKyZluaa	I would hurt more by love than trust.|`|smeaC4SHaa	IF you love someone you also trust her/him and if you trust someone that also means you love her/him enough to give your trust.<br>  <br>  It's kind of like a huge chain of relationship. It depends on every person because nobody has same "love" for everyone. Even when parents say that they love their children equally, that's a bunch of bull crap. So yeah<br>  <br>  but I would say it would hurt a lot if the person you love the most hurt you because he/she is just almost your everything unlike the person you trust, all he/she has are your secrets and whatnot.|`|RSm8aXgzaa	For me, the person I love most and the person I trust most is the same person and I would be absolutely devastated to be hurt by him at all.  In general, I would rather be hurt by the person I trust the most I think.  Because if you get hurt by the one you love, you start to question their love for you and that's never a good feeling.  But if someone you trust hurts you, I think it's a little easier to get over.  I don't know.  It varies depending on the situation.  Good question though.|`|Y0UGoKOpaa	The person I love the most because you always get over someone you love and just move on and not the person you trust the most because you start to have a hard time trusting anyone else and sometimes thats not good.|`|KCzzzCu2aa	The person I love, you can forgive them because you're in love with them but if it is the person you trust the most then their most honored quality is destroyed and it would be much harder to rebuild trust|`|XS49oJkQaa	i believe that with that much trust, love follows it.  so, if you're hurt by one or the other, its one in the same. the real question is how do u deal with it after the fact...|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Depends on the kind of hurt but I think I would have to go with the person that I love the most because if you love them the most you should trust them the most also...|`|jD1xacNbaa	Nobody would like to be hurt by anybody.|`|dn2nHtxOaa	If they weren't the same person, I think I would have to go for the person I love the most...|`|F5vyAdmpaa	"The person i love... i would be pissssed if someone i trusted hurt me... i would cry longer.

(you didn't say I couldn't say both! haha :P) because the person I love the most IS the person I trust the most|`|LDe9yzCKaa	id rather get hurt by someone that i love... cause it would be easier for me to forgive AND forget.... if the person i trusted the most is the one to hurt me, I would forgive but i would not be able to forget and then i may never be able to trust anyone else.. :)|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Trust. Because I can always forgive them eventually<br>  But I loved him so much, too much and he ended it just like that. Told me to move on just last night. It hurt's so much and I would never want anyone to go through this pain. I've already been hurt by the person I love the most but I'd rather it was the Truth|`|JqfIJtvYaa	I would say the person I love the most, because if it was the person I trusted the most, it would make it much harder to trust anyone again.|`|Q27cXlGbaa	the person u love.<br>  if the person u trust hurts u then u prolly wont trust them anymoree.<br>  <br>  but i dont see how u can love someone without trustin them.|`|o6uwV66jaa	Well the person I love the most..is the person I trust the most..<br>  <br>  = / someone already beat me to it . .
pKYpR7URaa	okay i have the same problem and just to be safe talk to him and see where his head is at : meaning that if he wants to be with you he has to undestand that u r sick and can get worse through any kind of mess he brings u way that will stree you and etc. so when you find out this then you base ur decision on what he say and do but you need to test the waters so when you do get out and decide to have a bf you want panic so much just think of it as a trail thing the both of you can learn at the same time|`|Mu2XsFpeaa	Psh! I dont know..i swear I got the same condition..if its a condition? Umm...i guess we both gotta do what we know is right and trust the feelings of uneasiness will subside in time.|`|1rcibKjmaa	Yeah its okay.  Im always scared someone asks me out, i've heard that people are going to ask. Im 13 and don't want to go out with anyone yet.|`|Zn7NNavKaa	i have panic attacks as well and i kno whow scary it can be and how hard it is to find someone who understands.     i dont believe anyone has actualy died from anxiety attacks.if you think this guy is worth it give it a try. the hard part of explaining your condition and him accepting it is over! if the relationship causess too much anxiety then you always have the option to end the relationship. dont live your life without love because of fear!    it is ok to be afraid thought. you cannot control what scares. just take it slow
X7i59NeIaa	You have stayed in touch for two years for a reason. Give the guy a chance. You don't have to jump in with both feet to take a chance and get to know him better. If you don't I think you will wonder all your life, what if he was the one. He sure sounds like a nice guy to me. You don't have to totally involve your children immediately. Get to know him a little bit first and then begin including your children in some of the things you do. Kids can handle a lot more than you think they can. Loosen up and put a little fun in your life. Good luck. You deserve happiness and this is a chance for that or at the very least a nice friendship.|`|xjdmXkqHaa	long distance rarely works. and its best to move on. <br>  he could very well be lying and cheating on you. <br>  <br>  been in long distance and he was unfaithful, disloyal, cheater, liar and a coward. if i was in your shoes i would move on.|`|QbOYIixuaa	It will never work!

He sounds like he likes you a lot but he also needs to understand he may like you but you love your children. It is our job as mommies to protect our kids. Now adays it is not safe to even leave them with family. Everyone is capable of doing something. We make mistakes we are human, however dont gamble with your children or take leaps of faith. We all have to answer to god one day, and you dont want to have to answer any questions regarding your judgement of character. Be smaert and cautious. Let God be your guide. God Bless.|`|dGBbFwFWaa	we all need that special someone in our lives .. u dont mention the age of your kids but i am guessing they are very young.. even thou u feel u might know him to some extend u are having second thoughts..and i would suggest .. him coming around as a friend ..and see how the kids  feel around him and him around the kids..give it time if everything goes well then u can move up ..but for the time being dont stress yourself or the kids.. u cant just bring someone into your kids life and expect everything to go well it all takes time.. but trust is the main issue here.. u have to know him well before u can trust any person into your life and kids life.. more less bringing someone into your home.. u have the right to find happiness but its also the right thing to make sure your kids will be safe and comfortable with this guy.. good luck|`|2WKN9kZiaa	amor de lejos... amore de pendejos<br>  <br>  EDIT ~ HAHA sorry I just didnt know how to say it in english but after elaborating... it means "Love in Distance is a three-somes Love"<br>  "amor a distancia es amor de tres"<br>  <br>  Something like that!!! English should have more rhyming phrases<br>  <br>  EDIT ~ sorry... after reading it I will give a serious response...<br>  it seems like you have failed in many relationships and whether you like it or not your children have already been damaged emotionally be seeing their mommy with other men... what perspective does this relationship have? marriage? or just dating and then we'll see where this goes? what I mean by asking this is that when you meet someone its important to know their goals and wants, if he is just curious about hooking up with you because he never had the chance and now maybe just wants to know "the what would have been".  Try the long distance relationship, maybe have him visit you once in a while more as a friend, for the sake of your kids and the example you may give them jumping from one guy to another.... and depending on how they react then you can make a decision... my sister has failed with quite a few relationships, she has 2 girls and is 33 and is giving up and raising her kids before trying to start another relationship.  Set your priorities straight.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	You will never get anywhere without taking chances.  I say go for it as it sounds like you want to.  You sound like you know what you want, and are aware of many aspects- so just keep that up if and when you get involved.  <br>  <br>  I think it would be easier on both of you if he moved closer, but long distance relationships can work.  It seems rare from all of the horror stories you hear, but they can work if both parties have mutual understanding and respect, and great communication.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Like I said, take a chance, and just remain aware at all times, and don't be afraid to break it off if and when it comes to it.<br>  <br>  Good luck!
AA11122479	parents do stuff like this. adults are crazy and silly people just take a deep breath and never forget they both love you. it will all work out. btw despite what you are thinking and feeling right now i promise their not a divorce in history caused by a child! adults can be complete idiots too|`|6BjZkRuYaa	Girl.  You mom and dad are husband and wife.  They are a couple and even though you are family - they are YOUR parents -  1st and foremost - they are people w/ private lives separate from you.

And lastly.... sorry honey, there is nothing you can do, b/c it has nothing to do WITH you.  Good luck.|`|Xi5Jno6haa	There's not anything that you can do.

f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	if you have to revenge gift then why are you even bothering to remain friends with this person?    Maybe her finances weren't in such great shape and she gave you what she could.  you have to look at the circumstances at that time.    you can regift the gift she gave you.  Oh you used it?  Well, then I guess it wasn't such a bad gift then.    This is the problem with expecting gifts, bean counting in your relationships, & not having a generous spirit.  You will always be disappointed and no one in your life will ever measure up.    If you're that upset after all this time then just stop being her friend and don't send anything.    edit:  LOL!  Oh Bubbles, you sucked me in and you got me!|`|a7364bce10f3534559a9e7a19fe16bcbaa	Stop being petty. Either give her a gift or don't, but it's childish, stupid and airheaded to do it for "revenge."

More so over something tiny as a gift!   it's the thought that counts and my friend didn't get ANYTHING from some of her peeps.     but your asking me and i dont' think you should!  not because you should be the better person!  but because it's not worth your valueable time to waste so much engery on someone who cna't give you a thoughtful gift!     i mean if you want to put forth all that effort so be it i see it as being wasteful!|`|29I8PWrxaa	Well it definitely speaks to your character if you only invited people to your wedding expecting them to give extravagant gifts.  I thought the purpose of inviting people was for them to witness and be a part of one of the most special moments of your life?|`|itbkP9HGaa	Sure, why not.  Birds of a feather flock together.|`|t4g6QLdVaa	1. You wouldn't want to stoop to her level if she did it to be spiteful.    2. Maybe she didn't have any money. I had an emergency once and was unable to buy a gift for a friends wedding. I felt horrible. Maybe that's what happened to her.|`|tWD175Pjaa	revenge always backfires well for me at least but i wouldn't spend a lot and if she was a good friends of mine i would pick a card and write a very thoughtful note just to let her know i wish her the best. if we weren't close i would shake her hand and thank her for the invite.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I believe in being the 'better person' most of the time and wouldn't give a revenge gift for something like this.    I would revenge gift a couple that is tacky enough to ask for cash - - I'd be sure to buy them a lovely vase or some other pretty dust collecter and not enclose a gift receipt and try to remove all traces of what store it originated at from the packaging, too.|`|di6p10Ifaa	You would make a bigger statement by not getting her anything at all. Or just regift and give it back to her. Orrrr....you could send her a pack of baby diapers. Just a thought it is pretty cold....but just some ideas. Think about it hard though before making a bee otch of yourself. lol.Good luck on being evil...lol!! :)|`|Z9WqYNR0aa	I would just re-gift the gift she gave you can send a "funny" card with it lOl|`|O954bykraa	I don't think that you need to be vengeful. What will you gain from it? Can you tell the person how you feel? Can you just be honest about it? It is possible that it is an honest mistake.|`|76nTvO4iaa	Ask your husband what he wants to do.    It's his family and he's the one who's going to get crap from his stepmother about it.    Your DH is probably going to elect to take the high road.  Get her a decent shower gift ($20 range). Give her a gift from her registry in the $50 range.|`|OIJ3JBkSaa	you sound like a nice girl so why tarnish your reputation by stooping so low as to behave like she did?  the gal above me has a good point - perhaps something came up and she honestly couldn't afford to buy something you would consider nice.   if you aren't invited to the wedding then you can simply send a nice card congratulating her on her wedding and wishing her well. if you are invited buy them a nice bottle of wine to go with the card.  for the shower if you are invited then buy a nice gift - twenty bucks can buy a nice gift so do that and don't waste the time or energy being petty or meanspirted!  if you aren't invited then you aren't obligated to do anything about the shower.  sooner or later karma always comes back and bites us in the bum!  lol  good luck!
rhVtBhKeaa	My parents were foster parents for eleven years. I grew up with me, my three full sisters, and three - four foster sisters at a time. The best thing you can do is just continue being there for him and listening to him. Even if they decided not to adopt him, they will still probably keep him until he is 18 if they really love him that much. A few of the girls that we had stayed with us from ages 13 or 14 until they turned 18, my parents wanted to adopt a couple of them but like your friends foster parents, my parents needed the money. We still keep in close contact with many of these girls even though we moved out of the state. So the best advice I can give is just keep close contact with him even if for some reason he does end up going to a new home.|`|xBd96wvRaa	You are right there is nothing you can do that you are not already doing. <br>  <br>  We'll, what you can do is meditate and think good thoughts his way.|`|711KONwOaa	adopt him!!!!!<br>  awww i bet he is nice<br>  and do my recent question<br>  please|`|MYO2k9EUaa	Are you old enough to adopt him? Probably not... anyway...<br>  <br>  All you can do is pray, if you're religious. Like it or not, times are hard, and if the foster family can't afford him, they can't. But if they can, they will adopt him. <br>  <br>  But if not, all you can do is comfort him when his dreams are crushed.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	well you could adopt him if you want to. i mean it wouldn't be too bad talk to his foster parents about it and find out i bet you could at least he'd be there for awhile it would make him happy and he could have a change to live.|`|pUUyYz4gaa	You can stick with him until you both are grown...and marry him.  <br>  <br>  My mother took case of foster kids...this is the best thing YOU can do if you are that serious.<br>  <br>  He deserves someone by his side.|`|Lkik9Sr7aa	i already answered the other one...
4IFXHz80aa	Yes, I would die for my husband and my best friend.|`|dOd7UqvGaa	Very much so.|`|BfDM12ptaa	oh yes! for 2 people!|`|CIzrjrykaa	yes  my girlfriend  my family    everyone  no one deserves death|`|zYXCKhulaa	Yes.I am ready to even die 4 my parents, if I am forced to do it bcoz of some reasons( like -to save their lives). If there is a better way to solve the problem than dying 4 them, I would go 4 it, bcoz both the lives of mine and my parents would be saved! Bcoz,  I love them a lot and I want to live with them 4 a longer time, and don't want to leave them alone in this whole wide world.  Hey! Sandeep, my answer is not going to be my lover/boyfriend  since I haven't had one in life( I am lucky- you should see my friends! If anyone comes and proposes to u , just say 'you have been my brother 4 years'- that's my policy.Our parents' love is the true love)|`|sYo2HOo4aa	Yes...many.   If  there are two ppl getting saved by me getting out of this World, I would surely opt to die.|`|cCcEIhEpaa	yes|`|AA10874773	there's more than one|`|WP36jh6Zaa	Only my son|`|pNqjsJn7aa	4 sure!!|`|vBSjdOhkaa	Definately Yes....   4 my parents...my bf... my friends.. my whole family..|`|TwPF7EzYaa	I honestly wouldn't die for anyone. I will die when the time comes, other than that No I wouldn't. Everyone should just die for themselves lol..    This is because I'm going to die anyway, Or I should say that WE all going to die one day..so why bother dying for someone else.     so my answer doesn't really matter I guess    However Is there someone YOU would die for?|`|xBW4saqgaa	for JESUS|`|b1nZYiVTaa	nope!|`|FFxxqj2Raa	yup , , , , yes, , , , and GOD knows only when i  Die . . .|`|AA11181335	Yes, but the big question is, will they do the same for me?|`|4b6288e1adef832fa181e563fd304a8aaa	yeah definitely for anyone cause i m an emo|`|gszWusLXaa	this is a question with an idealistic touch.its easy to say that i am ready to die for u than do it in reality|`|uK4R57AJaa	never! because god gifted me this life and ONly he has that right 2 take back!
p51w3k0laa	Well even though I am only 13 think my little knowledge might help. As you already know it is not the best thing to cut yourself. But don't worry about it! Everything in life happens for a reason. And no matter how bad things can get they will always end up straitening out in the end.<br>  Try calling the guy and tell him that you are really sorry about they way things went down and that you want to get back together. Tell him that you where just feeling lonely and just wanted him around. <br>  <br>  Trust me things will always work out! Just stop hurting yourself because making more hurt isn't going to make you feel better right?|`|Q5KFND17aa	and you really think you're going to find someone worth trusting over the internet? you know your friend does sound mean because she's supposed to be there for you, but maybe she has a point. if you're going to date someone who you knew would constantly be traveling and then you break up from too much traveling, it's nobody's fault and you can't really have expected much more. and i mean breakups can be really painful but look at it as a chance for something more, and by the way slitting your wrists won't solve sh*t. it will just leave ugly scars and people will think that's a really lame way of dealing with your problems. you should try therapy or making some decent friends.|`|7iwZRuUmaa	listen sweetie--all relationships are hard work. it doesn't help that your significant other was never around because of his work. it takes two people, in the same place at the same time, to make a relationship work. however, trying to relieve the pain of a breakup by cutting is not the answer. it's just adding another problem to your already spinning head. no matter what the circumstances are, it is always going to hurt when you split with someone. you need to talk to someone in your area that can help you sort your feelings out and put things into perspective. you need to speak with someone now! please do not wait. call the suicide prevention hotline at 1-800-273-8255 and talk to someone. they will help you find help/someone you can talk to in confidence in your area.
RK04Jktraa	...<br>  <br>  This is a little pedoish.|`|YCLXFOtxaa	She is good but needs to  work on her looks really.|`|bYvGNvrvaa	Eh she's okay, i mean she's not horrible, but of course i dont know her personality so i cant really say.|`|2FOKZbcfaa	cute, but not hot
A7bzhsn1aa	I went to a boarding school and saying goodbye is the hardest thing to do. It can be hard to say goodbye, especially if its hard to express yourself.  My suggestion would be call your friend. Ask if you can meet somewhere, because talking in person is more personal, even if its harder. Try to express yourself. It will be hard at first, I'm sure, but in the end, it will be worth it. Because then they'll know how much they mean to you.   After you talk with them, and get everything out, then just go have some fun! Try to make some memories that will last throughout your whole stay at your boarding school.   Trust me, if you don't try to take the intuitive, then you will regret it. Do it sooner than later; two days isn't a lot of time but at least you have time.|`|RfwOQUPGaa	Omg! I need genders!!  If it's a girl, and your a girl - i'd suggest you give her a hug, if your both boys - play football.  If your a boy and she's a girl, kiss!  If your a girl and he's a boy - seduce!!!|`|W1aYIF71aa	Just rub one off and pretend that it was with that special someone.|`|evEJxv06aa	just go to your friend  and talk to him or her  say that i was leaving to a boarding school and thought that i should come by and talk a little with you and say good bye i know we never had good conversation it all ways was awkward one but that doesn't mean that your not my friend right i mean we shared lots of memories together and i just wanted to share it with you for a while and to ask you that i only have two days left and i wanted to spend them with you and if you say no its ok and i hope that we are still friends when i leave what ever you decide  its fine with me anyways your always going to be my best friend ever ok.
F2rI3Juaaa	He would be patient and wait if his feelings are true! Your Mum is looking out for you!|`|c282b658121c083eb61a50380f3c922daa	If you think that your Mom has a valid reason, no use of talking to her.  Unfortunately, you must learn to live it.
GeruGGOQaa	Time heals all wounds is the biggest lie to ever be spread.    Face it you gave him some terrible advice.  Next time unless his kids make the first step to try to have a relationship with him leave the kids alone.  He was the adult.  He was the bad father.  He made his bed and now it may very well be too late to reconcile with his kids unless they decide it's what they want.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	Of course she resents him.  What can you say?  It doesn't sound like he's been a very good dad, I have to agree with him on that.  He might be able to make up with them but all those years when he wasn't there were painful and now he's got to face the music.  I feel bad for his kids, not him.|`|vz0tsPStaa	He was a dick, what do you want from them?|`|OBCvewW2aa	It's just so hard, this life thing, and it's just so easy blaming it all on daddy.  Genetically, historically- he's the one to make it all better and when he doesn't- the world is off-kilter.      Honorable would be accepting the blame, playing the part of the villain.  It's the least he can do after abandoning such a weak woman.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	Nothing you can do. You REAP what you SOW???|`|uGFzzLYWaa	He wasn't there for his kids, and those kids, especially the oldest, watched their mother suffer because he bailed out on them. Do you have any idea what that is like to live like that, as a child? I sure do.     So he gave her some money, so what? That makes NOTHING right. Where was the money when she needed it?  Where was he when the kids needed their father? What gave HIM the right to bail and start his life over with no responsibilites, while she stayed and kept things afloat, going without, living hand to mouth, raising the kids alone?  I don't blame his daughter for not speaking to him. Your husband brought it all on himself, and he can reap what he sowed all those years ago.|`|2b4OFx5Oaa	We make the bed we sleep in. Suck it up.|`|rX8MkfBJaa	nothing.    he just has to live by example...    No words will change the way they feel.|`|ntfAzDGKaa	Bite the bullet    MILDRED IS MY LEADER|`|H3WHxCgaaa	Be supportive and encouraging...she will come around eventually!  It takes time when you hit early adulthood to work out childhood issues...give her time!  Your husband has quite a few years to get worked out with them - just tell him to keep trying, it'll pay off...|`|i1rDJY2aaa	Why would YOU marry a man that refused to have anything to do with his own flesh and blood for nineteen years?    WHY on EARTH are you defending this deadbeat loser?|`|QoDLaQiraa	Well he should feel guilty. It sounds like he abandoned his kids for most of their lives and now is "hurt" that they don't just forgive him. They grew up without a father and with serious monetary issues because there deadbeat Dad was to immature to step up to the plate. Leaving your wife is one thing but doing that to your kids is another.    I am sorry this isn't what you want to hear, but perhaps this will act as a lesson for other things in his life. Maybe he will learn from this not make large mistakes like this in the future.
dFHsAXDMaa	okay number 1 stop stressing over it really just let the kisses happen naturally no secret to great kissing like playing follow the leader lol|`|pbPe614Raa	just maybe practice more with an object similar to a mouth,youll feel confident i bet after a while.<br>  just picture what you would want and mimic it with that object.|`|ikoO9EBmaa	experience, some people suggest spelling your name with your tounge in their mouth. maybe im just terrible (im pretty confident that im a champ) or maybe im right. just try to play with the tip of their tounge

If its serious you could send her (real mail) a card every day for a week with a message like "thinking of you" so she knows she is in your thoughts. The more serious the relationship the more serious the messages.     Long distance relation ships are difficult to send the test of time. Good luck.|`|ryDqMraZaa	make sure you keep in touch. send cute texts|`|yyIVrngcaa	for sure, :) try and mail her roses, make sure you always let her know shes on your mind, make her a video singing her favorite love song, upload it to youtube for everyone to know how much she means to you! lol|`|f7l9byFGaa	Send her flowers or a card, it doesn't have to be for a special occasion just a little something to tell her you are thinking of her.  You can always text her or send her an email or ecard telling her you miss her or are thinking of her.
7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	You have to get to know her on some level before she is even going to trust you.  Try some simple conversation with her first so she knows you are not some derranged weirdo.

jQTFXMbqaa	i don't think there is anything whoreish about it. you were in an abusive relationship, and no one should ever fell bad for getting out of that. so move on if you think this friend would be good to you and except the baby you are having give it a try. good luck..|`|ZA11WBR2aa	He likes you, you like him, so what's the problem?  I see no problem so you should go ahead and date this best friend of yours.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	I say follow your heard but at the same time do not leave the father of your child out of your life.  You two are going to be a part of eachothers lives no matter what.  He may not have treated you right, but give him a chance as a father.  People can change as they mature so do not give up on him as he may be an awesome father.|`|a1uoxczTaa	i do not find this whoreish at all. if u want to be with him, then be with him. hopefully he knows u r pregnant, if not you need to tell him. if he does then that just makes him that much more of a great guy.|`|AA10911598	Normal to desire a companion no matter if you are pregnant or not.  You deserve a good person to be by your side.  Perhaps you should accept his friendship and see how things progress.  You don't have to marry him to just have dinner together or go to a park for a walk.  This sounds wonderful.  After being with an abusive man a good one will be welcomed.  Enjoy and go slowly.  Allow this man to be there for you when you need him.|`|UZhYso4paa	if he knows that u are pregnant ...and still loves u   u r the BLESSED ONE...    its u'r chance 4 a new life|`|JnlYIzwdaa	i think,...  you should tell the best friend of yours...  that your pregnet...  take him out to diner and tellhim..  see how he reacts tel him you love him.. so much you had to tell him;..   and if he says im ok with that. then he REALY loves you!  if not it means spend time with your friends hangout and love that baby wwith all your heart!!  i think you should date the guy..  like those fairy tale movies..  when a new guy comes up and helps you raise that child  when its not his but... you think it is his!!  and you love him and that child with all our HEART!  i hope that helps  god bless
tRUfMGB1aa	Well, she may've asked another guy for a hug, but she did ask to be YOUR valentine. Which one way or another means that she does have some kind of feeling for you.<br>  If I were you, since you do like her, you should just tell her that, and ask if she likes you too, although make sure not to say anything like "From the way you've been acting with me, it really seems like you do" or anything along those lines, because that can be easily misunderstood as cockiness. But ask her if she likes you, and if she says yes, then if you feel comfortable enough, as her if she wants to be your gf :]<br>  Hope this helped.
bYvGNvrvaa	It all depends on what she's into, like maybe you could get her a purse by her favorite designer. You can never go wrong with gifts cards, and you can buy visa cards and put a certain amount of money on it and then she can spend it anywhere she wants to.|`|GCsJaUcfaa	get her somthing she will NEVER forget:) a top? a home-made gift? if u cant decide just go:) if she is truly ur friend she would be happy u even came, u didnt have to u know... or if she is rich u might want to get her somthing from when she was a kid er somthing. She might just be happy if she got a FriendShip braclet :) some ppl like that and only something from the heart. give her something she cant buy with her money.|`|gol1O8Rhaa	Buy her an automobile....I prefer a Lambourghini, Ferrari, or a BMW.|`|VzFPmeTpaa	Give her a kiss n say u love her|`|KACLbLvlaa	make a scrapbook of you and her and friends, pictures with little sayings and such.  I got one and loved it.|`|B2bDFFolaa	Give her something money can't buy... Now what that might be who knows...one year I bought a kit and made my friend a scarf... but think about jewelery or other things you can make...yourself, because that puts a priceless value on it.. or put together a recipe book of some of her favorite foods or something like that.. of if she is getting a car, get her car stuff...|`|iKLdGe1xaa	Make something. An album of the two of you and your friends, things that are special to you and her. Give her a gift from the heart not from the pocket.
JCAgvgTxaa	I prefer one nice floral arrangement at the altar (or to the side), with mention in a wedding program.    For example, at the bottom of the program you could print:  The yellow (or white) roses on the altar are in loving memory of   Mrs. Barbara Smith, the bride's grandmother  Mrs. Jane Jones, the bride's grandmother  Mr. John Doe, the groom's father  Mr. Enrique Doe, the groom's grandfather    The chair thing would be too sad for me, and many of your guests may also find it sad.  You have to remember that there are others present who loved the deceased family members also.  You don't want to do anything they might find disturbing . . . or grief-inducing, I guess one would say.|`|AA10874773	its deceased, dear.  not diseased.  yes, in a vase with a note would be very nice - not a downer at all.|`|1768faf9e5b2a30b04ec84addc43d163aa	Im sorry I dont have any ideas at the moment. But that sounds great!!!!|`|LVNbP6VWaa	I wouldn't do the chair thing because it would be too sad for me: you know they are not there.  Remember how emotional you will be on your wedding day anyway!    I love the idea of having long stemmed roses in a vase near the guest book or even the cake.  Def mention them in the speeches and it would be nice to add a final note to your programme.    Have a lovely day. x|`|itbkP9HGaa	I had a good laugh about your typo.  Obviously you mean deceased, but you sure did give me a good laugh!    I think the idea is a wonderful one, and don't worry about it being a downer.  You can do something in memory of someone without having it be heavy or morbid.  I like the idea of a rose with white ribbon.  It seems less morbid than black.|`|D7ZJtB4vaa	For our wedding which was in October we had one single white carnation (or whatever flower is your preference) in a small vase that sat up with our unity candle.  Then on the back of our programs we put towards the bottom that it was there in memory of family no longer with us and those who may be serving over seas.  Of course we did explain as to who it was that we were speaking of.|`|HCgNSgKBaa	That would not be a downer, what I would do is put them up where everyone can see them, and put a note about it in the program. So that you can do it tastefully, and state in rememberance of    _____ , they couldn't be here with us this day, but with these flowers we let them know we wanted them here. Or something along those lines. I think this is a great idea|`|AkUhaMm9aa	you gave me a great idea..i wanted to do something like that for my mon, she just passed a month ago and I didn't know how to do it, without making it look too sad..we are not having programs or candles..but the roses sound very lovely.    thanks|`|7CKipTZOaa	I think a vase by the sign in would be lovely|`|cGbTJobeaa	I'm in the same camp as fizzygurl.  You can honor them n a way that is known and special to you and unknown to your guests.  You can incorporate their memory in so many quiet ways like having their favorite flower in your bouquet or by playing a song that reminds you of them.    Weddings are a time of celebration; not mourning.  The deceased will be on your mind anyway without making an elaborate production out of their absence.|`|di6p10Ifaa	to have a tribute to a "deceased" person...people generally put a note reserving a chair that says something along the lines of "here in memory" or "here in spirit" then the name. Or you could have a tribute printed in the program and have a song dedicated to them at the reception. Don't overdo it though, it is a wedding not a funeral.|`|E7LQp6VRaa	That sounds like a pretty idea... I would go with them in a vase on  your sign in table..    I am doing an In memory of... type thing at our wedding...    I had a glass candle holder etched with my brothers name and date and I am going to burn a candle in his favorite colour during the ceremony and reception..    We are also putting a little note about it in our programs, stating what the candle is for..|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	I always think it's a downer to do anything in remembrance of deceased relatives at a wedding.  It is a time of happiness and celebration, not mourning.  Maybe you can incorporate their memory in another way that is significant to you but not necessarily known by your other guests.  For instance, if your fiance's dad or grandpa had a nice pair of cufflinks or a pocket watch or something like that, you could have him wear it as part of his wedding attire to honor him.  You could do the same by wearing a piece of jewelry that belonged to each of your two grandmas.  That way you could feel like they are close to you that day without making a big, sad deal out of it and involving all your guests.

4T9fZzITaa	well you have to ask yourself.. who can you not be without?  who do you want to spend the rest of your life with (even if you cant marry the other guy) i'm sure that you have love for your husband but yes you two were young when you met & now your older & you met someone new & different. you should definitely tell the other guy how you are married if you really want to break things off with him. and if he still insists then he isnt going to give up. but you need to choose and make a decision that you wont regret. cuz its not fair for you or the guys. everybody deserves to be happy and whoever you dont pick just wasnt ment to be and will have to move on|`|x4dXLF8Raa	get with both of them :]  sharing is caringg lol|`|S1SmhxvSaa	you fell in love at 14. wow|`|X9RBRqL2aa	break up with the second guy. when you go to so it just remember that youre helping him more than hurting him. if he doesnt get it when you break up with him then just be straight with him and say that you cheat on the other dude with him.    btw, your messed up if you dont break up with one of them because thats selfish. you are trying to keep one of them for yourself when you are the one who should get dumped by both of them|`|AIit3XCMaa	Honesty is the best policy.

sGP6s7uraa	There's a memory game that was really fun.  Fill a tray with all sorts of items.  Tell everyone you're doing a memory game.  Have the bride show each guest the tray and give them about 10 seconds to scan over it.  When everybody has had a chance to look at the tray, have the bride go into a different room where she cannot be seen and ask the guests "What was the bride wearing?" See how many groan at this...The winner with most accurate descriptions wins a prize.    Another one is to interview both bride and groom and have the guest guess what they answered. I.E. "Sharon said she wanted ______ number of kids.  Jim said he wanted _______ number of kids." The one with the most correct answers wins.     Tell stories about the bride.  They best, cleanest, funniest stories.  Vote on the best story and the teller gets a prize.|`|itbkP9HGaa	I am also matron of honor in my friend's wedding, and I googled bridal shower games and there are hundreds of games out there!  Much easier to just google them.    Edit:  People will be Debbie-Downers about shower games, but really their opinions don't matter.  Its what the bride wants that's important.  If she wants a typical bridal shower with games, gifts, etc, then that's what she should get.  Her guests should be gracious enough to participate and make the best of it, no matter what their private thoughts may be.    Also, Jibotta suggested having it at a restaurant and having everyone pay the bill.  That would really be throwing etiquette to the wind.  The proper thing to do in that situation is foot the bill, which is what i'm doing.|`|G7uEd6JRaa	Those games are kind of cheesy and most people won't have a good time if you play them.     Is it a co-ed shower? Do the bride and groom love to play games? How about board games or a poker night, you could theme the shower around that. You could even rent a karaoke machine. That and a few drinks will make for a great, FUN shower.     Is it a girls only shower? What about dinner out and dancing for the girls? You could have the guests bring gifts to the restaurant and take care of their own bill...    Remember, it's about your friend and having fun, so try to make it a party that will reflect her (and her husband to be).|`|HEhRgr7Zaa	There is one I played at a shower, it was like a purse scavenger hunt and each item was worth a certain number of points depending on how rare it was that someone would have it in their purse.     Another one I played was similar to the one said below with the asking of questions between the bride and groom but each time the bride got one wrong she would have to stuff a marshmallow in her mouth. She has to keep answering questions with all the marshmallows in her mouth. It gets funny if she gets alot wrong.     Also I got together some pictures of the bride through-out different stages of her life and the guests have to guess how old she is in each picture.     The last one that we played was a coloring/drawing game. Everyone got a piece of paper and crayons and drew a picture of their favorite memory of them and the bride. People can be as creative as they want. The more creative the better and funnier.     Hope this helps!!|`|DBdR26Ssaa	do wedding pictionary. get an easel and a dry erase board then make up cards and then get on teams. and draw and guess. sounds fun to me.|`|YldfngvAaa	Nobody actually likes to sit and fill those silly game forms out. Rather than do those time consuming boring games at my shower, everyone is filling our BINGO cards with what gifts they think I will get, then as I open them they can mark off items to win prizes. That way they are entertained while I open gifts(because lets face it, nobody likes to watch someone open gifts either.)      Ohhhh. I am sorry people, but nobody under the age of 50 likes those fill in the blank type games. The only people that enjoy them at any shower I have ever been to are my great aunts and Grandma. They are just sooooo dated.

0a3d8785f8742829b2a54e45eb88c0e0aa	No, it's not just you; if he's doing things that are out of character, then yeah, he's acting strange. There are many possibilities.<br>  <br>  He could have feelings for you and his reactions towards other guys making a move on you could be out of jealousy.<br>  <br>  He could also just be protective of you, since you two are best friends and he just wants the best for and doesn't want you to be hurt.<br>  <br>  Adding on to the possibility of him liking you, maybe he brings up his girlfriends to see how you would react, so he could see whether or not you like him.<br>  <br>  Good luck with whatever happens, though. :)|`|yBTGXdFwaa	Maybe he has feelings for you too, either that or you sent him some physical signal, ( looking down or away from him, acting quiet, etc.) and he thinks you don't want to talk about it. Maybe he's getting a little jealous too. Why don't you just ask him about it, and tell him you like him, otherwise it's going to come out into the open at a bad time..just be honest with him.
55oy2i5caa	Wait and see if it happens before you do anything. Maybe she'll realize on her own that it's a crowded house and she needs to be discreet. <br>  <br>  If she does "shout to the rooftops", I think it's ok to talk to her privately and let her know it's a bit of an intrusion to the family. Especially since you get along with her, I don't think she'll take offense. <br>  <br>  And it's not that there's anything wrong with sex, or enjoying it (loudly!) but a little common courtesy is expected with multiple families living together. I went on a camping trip and listened to the same thing (during the day). Pretty uncomfortable as we all sat around the picnic table at lunch! :)|`|xPeIvywdaa	what you proposed sounds good, if they do it once when they move in then give them a talk to, or at least her<br>  <br>  i agree with you, that would bother me as well|`|1N3wmqz7aa	LOL  tell your daughter what sex is.|`|DTGO1pgyaa	If you two meaning you and your bros girl, have an understanding talk to her and let her know that you don't feel it's appropriate to have your daughter hear her. maybe you can talk about a general time frame where you and your daughter can go out and do something to give her and her husband some time but also make sure that you make it clear that it wont be all the time. compromise. and you're right 6 years old is too young.|`|g5dzse2Zaa	I would wait and see what happens and if it continues i would have a talk to your brother about it, i think if you confront her about it she might get embarrassed about it. Its understandable you have a young child and even still its a bit dis-respectful. <br>  Good luck with everything i hope it all works out. :D|`|5d195e54caaa6a0cbc66deb5e6454516aa	I would talk with both of them and tell them, that they can't be making so much noise when they are having sex.

When it does bring it up to her and tell you how you feel or you will become very irritated and things will become bad.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	if you ever have a all girl discussion with her... if you are discussing something that can lead to a sex talk... then bring it up. let her know that its not ok to be as loud as if you lived alone anymore. you live with a child now. its not appropriate anymore. even if she laughs it off you need to let her know your serious. and it does concern you for your child's sake and your sanity.|`|ePfPOeAzaa	u knw,the best thing is to see what impact living with ur parents has on her.if it doesn't alter her kitty behaviour,then the best thing is to have a nice talk with her about it.or hav u tried that already?if that doesn't work...try to ignore it and if ur daughter asks,try to assure her that they r just playing a game or having fun or sumfn.i mean,as a six year old i think that's the best way to make her undrstand.it's tough,i undrstand...gud luck|`|g1coKXlHaa	That's a tough Q. I would talk to them about it and explain that it isn't appropriate with a six year old or the olds living there. I too am noisy but keep it as quite as possible when my mother in law and her children are here, out of respect, some times we just don't bother. So maybe you should say that she needs to show some restraint and respect for your daughter. and yes i dare say she would get a kick out of it, it's like being watched, some peops get a gr8 kick out of it.|`|hUXAA4Zcaa	Wait until you get there- hopefully they keep the noise level down, but if they don't, I suggest the simple answer- talk to them.  It may be pretty awkward bringing it up, but you can use your daughter as an excuse.  Let them know that the noise has rose questions with your daughter and you don't want to be put in the situation of explaining that to her (at least not that young).  Hopefully, they weren't paying notice to their noise level before solely because everyone else in the house was an adult, and- yes- it may have turned her on.  If you are really worries about them keeping the noise down, then you will have to suck it up and talk to her before y'all get there.  When it comes down to it, there is now a child that will be in the house, and the behavior is not appropriate when she's a wrong.  Besides, she's YOUR shield, and you have a right to control the things she hears and to keep out the things you deem inappropriate.|`|fOS41FAfaa	I would probably wait until it happens. Hopefully they will be a little more considerate with that many people around. You might give your brother some hints before it happens, but be subtle. <br>  <br>  You could always spray them with a hose if it gets too out of hand, lol.. jk|`|TS5z0SPwaa	Talk to her about it only if it becomes an issue.|`|383f4d6a956578b957700c7932e4b092aa	Maybe a tactful way would be to buy her a radio and tell her something like your not ready for your daughter to be exposed to that noise and ask her to put her radio on whenever they are in the mood. That's a tough one tho, she should be respectful of you daughter who is a little young to know whats going on|`|7XSMjgroaa	While if I was in your position, I might wait to bring up the issue of sex with her, it might be better to bring it up now rather than later. Kids these days are learning about and having sex earlier and earlier, and it might be better to raise the topic and talk about it now before later.<br>  <br>  Just sit her down with your husband and tell her that there are some "grown-up" things that you need to talk about, etc. and just go from there<br>  <br>  Also, as embarrassing as it may be, you might also try talking to your brother and his girlfriend FIRST and ask them discreetly to keep their "activities" quiet, especially while your 6 year old daughter is there. This might be better and easier than sitting your daughter down and talking to her about sex so early|`|mQQsCrX1aa	wow. we kind of have that problem with our neighbors. However, this being family, you could probably do what I cant and thats have a talk with them (its going to be an uncomfortable talk but something you will have to get through) expressing your concerns and just show them the opposite end as well. Ask them how they would feel if they were to overhear you all the time.|`|29WFvvNPaa	This is how you deal with this situation.  You speak with her, in private, as not to embarrass her any more then she might be already.  I would honestly tell her over the phone.  It might be a little less traumatic for her that way.  You should tell her before she arrives because I would rather that, then have a child have to hear it.  You can't really wait to see if she does it again because if she does, they'll be in the middle and i wouldn't get out of bed to knock on their door.  Tell her it is disrespectful of the persons in the household and not only that, but it is unacceptable because there is a child involved.  Better to take care of it immediately.|`|kdSuwt8paa	Just tell her the walls are paper thin and neither you nor your daughter want to share in their love making so please keep the noise down.

ghz5D5iLaa	Yes you are wrong about girls. Being attractive does not automatically make you shallow and self centered. You should not categorize people like this. We are all different and you can't judge us all by a few.

I mean, i'm curious as to how you met this guy and why is a 35 year old man courting a 20 year old female?|`|K1iUzewyaa	age is fishy.. I was with a girl 10 years older than me.. she was controlling. I had to do this and that, couldn't enjoy a game, etc. If I said one minute. she upped and did it herself.. Now, guys are different. So I'm going to say no, not too old.. however, I believe you are too young. Guys get older, they want to settle down, where as girls are young, tend to want to get out and party, enjoy life. if you don't see yourself marrying this guy, don't do it..  Eventually, you're going to feel like he took advantage of you cause you're young, and you're gonna want to break up, or if married divorce...|`|9CUaikUEaa	no i dont think it could work, because while you want to be out having fun and going wild with your friends, being in a relationship will tie you down and he will get annoyed with you going out all the time.  live your life, dont become boring for him.|`|PfmXPbFpaa	I hope not as there is a 22 year age difference between me and my guy.  We are a year and going strong, planning the future, and I believe we really love each other to make it work.    Do we think such a relationship would work?  That would depend on the people involved and their personalities -- not their age.  Age is just a number, not who you are.|`|fFnfFROQaa	Possibly.    I wouldn't put all my eggs in one basket.  Some work out, but most don't.    You are from different generations.  Both of you need to meet halfway.  You think differently so your attitude and mannerisms may not be agreeable to each other.  You may like to party every weekend at a club, he may prefer a movie or a concert instead.    In order to make it work out, both of you need to meet halfway...give some things up to accommodate the other...    If you are willing to do that, then by all means..go for it.  Many times those young-old relationships don't work, because of irreconcilable differences like described above.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	It could totally work.|`|5lENsDJgaa	Yes.  When I was 14, my cousin taught me this formula to know how old/young I could date (as a 14 year old, you can only date other 14 year olds):    The oldest:  2 x (YOUR AGE - 7)    The youngest:  (YOUR AGE / 2) + 7    Therefore, as a 20 year old, you could date anyone 17 to 26.|`|k16Uwtteaa	HELL YES. He's way to old for you! You are better off looking for someone in your own age group.|`|9pSizOGpaa	if hes filthy rich|`|083e9846706988570511a5b3e605f74aaa	i think it could but if ur not sure of it then dont be with him. the only one that can make the choice is u|`|ZCN5rGkWaa	i believe it can depends on how mature is the 20 year old , understanding each other has nothing to do with age , hope i helped.|`|q4V7Zi0Haa	I know someone who has a 20 year difference. shes 60, hes 40. They make it work. Love conquers all! (except for when they die before you and you have to be sad) |`|uIrQkesbaa	These day's it's impossible to tell if a relationship is gonna work. No one can commit these days and we're always looking for the next best thing. But 15 yrs? Lets just say my grandparents are still together after 50 yrs and they're 15 yrs apart. So good luck!|`|S4VVE0onaa	i have a friend that is 20 dating a guy that is 37. i was shocked when she told me about him and i was against the relationship in the beginning but then when i saw how well he treated her and how much they cared for each other i changed my opinion.    if you really believe that there is a future between you both go for it, but don't be surprised if your family and friends are upset about it.    good luck!|`|V4PA9foJaa	i dunno, but if u go by the hollywood trend, tom cruise-katie holmes=15, george clooney-his gf=18, michael douglas-katherine=13(that lucky bustard) and so on.. but we also have len wiseman-kate beckinsale=1!!! u decide goood luck!! plus... astudy suggests that sperm quality of men decrease when they touch 40, so that may men no satisfaction in bed...Good Luck!! the choice is yours!!!|`|hrFGKAeraa	you're both adults, so it depends on you guys. do YOU think he's too old for you? if so then you might want to reevaluate your relationship.|`|L8FJUBQnaa	yea sorry to tell you that he is to old for you and all i know it sucks if you do love him and he is to old for you and some times it is for the good of you to but i dont want you to do anything that you know will effect the rest of you 2 life and all you should still talk to each other and all you can still be friends and all just dont marry him and all you dont want him dieing before you even have kids or do something that you can do a the age he is at|`|yfx8KyTGaa	Nah, it won't work.  He'll probably want to have a baby right away and you still have a lot to experience.|`|Pc7EiyBHaa	The age difference isn't the problem.  Is there a big difference in the maturity level?  If there is you might think about waiting to go too far with this relationship.  Most of the girls I know that are your age are with older men because they are more mature and have their heads on straighter than the ones your age.  The relationships I know are okay for now but some of them are fighting a lot because the man who is older has different ideas about how things should be in the relationship.  Just make sure you know each other and trust each other 100% before you commit to anything.  All relationships need that.|`|lUSknAQtaa	Weell it al depends on your compatibility..your likes and interests and what u both want out of the relationship.he has to realize thatyou are just about to start living ..and he has already done most of the things you are going to experience. I would say if it works for you both then go at it.discuss what he wants out of you and expects...and let him know that when he gets upset with you dont use your age as a disss....take care|`|boIRASS7aa	My dad is 52 and his new wife is 27.  They seem to get along great!  Age is really a number after you become an adult...|`|5MkwIq6Jaa	I've date older guys too. Up to about 25 years my senior and I can honestly say it depends on the guy. Think about what the two of you could possibly have in common? He has way more experience in life and relationships. So, if he acts his age, he is probably with you for sex, or the prospect of it. If he is immature, then you have to ask yourself if you really want someone in your life that is almost old enough to be your father and still hasn't matured to such a level. Consider why he isn't dating women his own age. If it applies, why isn't he married or have kids? Remember, you will be growing and maturing at a rapid rate for the next ten years, he's set in his ways.|`|i4bMNcmgaa	noo i think it'd be good for experience, but for a intimate relacionship thats kind of nasty mann its like if your mom was dating a grandpa.. how grose.. well if you like that kind of stuff go for it|`|1bb8d470f82f8d3bf45bc0813b126c7faa	if he's a mature 35 year old then you might be doing yourself the biggest favor of your life... you have plenty to learn at this age and it could be extremely beneficial to be intimate with a more mature figure than your (for the lack of a better word) crazy peers =)   good luck!|`|763ce153f7628cfd4764c25b6a7ce844aa	It's possible and I have seen people stay together with more of an age difference but it's up to you. He'll be in his glory that such a young woman is interested in him. Beware though he may only want you for sex. The only way to know for sure is to let it play out and see what happens. I'm 36 and if I were single I would consider a serious relationship with a 20 year old and would probably expect to have kids some day with that person and make a good life together. I would also enjoy having sex with a younger woman. Hope this helps you with your decision, follow your heart.  Good Luck!|`|XAd3gV6Zaa	NO! I'm 20 and dating a 32 year old. And let me tell you, NO guy my age could even begin to compare to him! The thing with older men is they know what they want and they seem to care more about pleasing their women than younger men who are more selfish. As long as he treats you good and you guys have fun together, it really doesn't matter.|`|k6DAgwqyaa	the age really doesn't matter and if a girl of 10 would date a 25v year old that'd be weird but you guys are adults and i think it doesn't really matter unless hes like 30 years older i mean just follow your heart just forget about the age think of how much you care bout him and how much you love him i think that's what matters in a relationship not the age not the color not the clothes you wear just how you feel about each other and that's  it|`|Q33dbzAdaa	ok females, we get it.   If a woman dates someone a lot younger than them, they are cougars looking for exciting sex.     If a man dates someone much younger than them, they are pervs looking to use someone for sex.    I think boy toys should read some of these answers very carefully and realize they are loving their future demonizer. That is how many females are going to treat them when they get older.  Thats the  2 reason I would never be an older woman's boy toy. The number 1 reason being fertility issues.     Technically if you think about it, older men are the most successful people in our society at making age gaps work. They should be the only people allowed to do it if success means anything.    When I'm older I will gladly date someone much younger than me because I think young women who like older guys are the only real authentic friend the male gender has. Thats the only woman who doesnt call males over 30 pervs and sickos and letches. Thats the one I want to share my business successes with in 15 years when I'm in my 40's.    Older woman younger male almost never works  in society, but no woman would say not to do it because of that. Its just when the older person is male they go "it cant work.. so dont do it". How shady and convenient.|`|BUET39wmaa	ummmmmm  well me thinks he is in it for the sex with a young one....  other than that what the hell would you have in common with him?|`|hBmafVYoaa	Absolutely. It depends on the people. But age difference doesn't matter if you are compatible.|`|bID1Pd7Gaa	You're both adults. If you like each other then who am I to judge?|`|yC4REA3waa	maby|`|AA12392755	If you are asking, then the answer is yes.|`|GWmkKF5jaa	looking for a green card from a american guy?|`|I5wje0J1aa	Yes. dump him.|`|nPfxPidTaa	Yes...."The thing i love about high school girls is, I get older they stay the same"|`|4RiziMD0aa	yes as long as you both are on the same wave lenghts. i use to go ut with a guy who was ten years older but it ended cuz he wanted marriage and i felt too young. but nothing hurts if you try.|`|slJlLGMVaa	maybe...|`|89YkHxMUaa	It could but i would be cautious.     Most of my friends that were girls would go out with an older guy and they just went out with them to get a young girl.    Ever hear of older men going through mid life crisis?|`|Z1FdawAOaa	i don't think it's THAT bad.|`|LQSApB5raa	possibly could work but don't recommend it.....if  u were 35 and he was 50 then go for it but ur only twenty.....|`|MRpSUNNhaa	You are not jail bait so its fine.|`|eda699c69fc8eaff0f10239e82b318d9aa	No. You're young and want to party. He's older and wants to settle down.|`|17daa234be24f8405a47de49a120567caa	My guess is no, but the reason I say that is because both of your are probably at different stages in your life, but hey I cannot say for sure because I don't know all the circumstances.|`|6X2p6Zkwaa	ummmmm   a short one yes  a "real "one no! have fun BTW  Working Stiff Mom is soooo right!

Do what ever you want to do and there's nothing she can do about it. Besides, whoever the boy is, if there is one, he clearly must not like her seeing that they aren't together. And you can't be that old because I would hope that these aren't high schoolers that are acting this childish. But don't sweat it and don't be confused, everything is going to be fine. (Girls get jealous easily and it survival of the fittest!) Good luck and I hope this helps!|`|AA12108498	OK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE A GIRL CLOSES HER HURT AFTER BEING MISTREATED SO MANY TIMES.

So I would just keep being friends with all the guys, that's usually who I got along with any way. Girls tend to be insecure and jealous over nothing!  When they see they can't intimidate you they'll quit. If not kick some *** walk away and tell em get over it.
AA11588121	A genuine, quality friendship persists through time. It is about not letting trivial, or even rather large, conflicts get in the way. Both people must put in conscious effort to maintain a true friendship. Sacrifice, tears and tests are inevitable. A true friend would stay up all night to listen to your issues. They would continue to listen day after week after month after years, listening to the same or similar problem, and still actually care about what you have to say. A Real friend would write to you in jail multiple times, if not at least every month for years. The relationship is understood at a higher emotional, mental, spiritual and intellectual level.    True friendship is a different type of love. It becomes a commitment. Shared experiences enhance the bond, but does not necessarily build genuine understanding. Trust, loyalty, forgiveness, patience and the ability to communicate well will all tested. A friend who truly understands your logic must understand your state of emotion. Disagreements are bound to occur, but the real test is your tolerance. Maintaining such a friendship means putting aside convenience--It must be consciously prioritized as a part of your life style. Just as family would and probably always will be a part of your life, so should true friends. These friendships help you figure out and create who you are and what you value. It teaches you to perceive in depth each others perspective of the world. It's no longer mainly about how much time you spend with them, but more about who is down for you when times are thin and your world is crumbling apart. It's about being selfless to a certain degree for each others well beings. Their problems are your problems/business and vice versa.    They have unconditional love and care, like the way you forever love your child, for you. Good advice enhances, but genuine care forms the foundation. Embarrassment caused by others and things society shuns of you are small obstacles in the way; the real obstacle is somehow expressing to each other how under appreciated they are. Real friends accept you and see you for who you are instead of categorize you based on your gender and whatnot. Past wrong doings and regrets do not define or provoke their judgment of you.    Good friends understand your sense of humor and see eye to eye with you on something, if not many things. They bring out a part of you that you usually don't feel the need to show with others, being resilient when you are usually not. You mature and learn together with them and have at least some underlying values. They encourage each other to achieve higher goals.  Genuine friends develop your individuality as you learn to overcome the rejection of your parents and other friends of your friendship--such situations teach you to think for yourself and not let society's influence overcome you.|`|3TdT5mG2aa	I think a true friend is someone who is always there for you. They do equal talking and listening. They are not disrespectful to you and they always call when they say they will. If they do not call, they have something serious going on in their life's. They do not spread rumors or gossip about you and they never tell other people's secrets to you. It is hard to find true friends. I have had more than my fair share of bad friends. The more I look at the past, the more I realize that they used me without me realizing it. They were one sided and loved to talk about other people behind their back, even if the statement that they spoke was true.|`|07cdc5710ed692974b09c64c65058e4aaa	Friendship is about "giving"...  You do not own a person, so you give of yourself freely, being loyal, keeping secrets, enjoying each other's company, not judging, understanding, empathetic, loving, kind, and compassionate.      Not everyone is going to treat you the way you treat them. I do not care for how my BFF dates men & plays them. Yet, it is her life & her way of doing what is best for her, I do not voice my opinion.  However, she has no problem telling me who I should date & why she never likes anyone I've ever had her meet. - to me, this isn't a real friendship! Sometimes, you have to butt out even when you are asked - "what should I do"...|`|UIizltysaa	well i been through this kind of stuff before...fake freiendships...ya a way to know that a person is a friend is when you dont see them hangin with your enemies and they are so anxiouse to know your secrets..just have friends associates...because sometimes people can just spill your secrets out..|`|W1aYIF71aa	A good friend will bail you out of jail.  A true friend will be next to you saying, "Dude, that was awesome."|`|kZFw2SGUaa	my best friend i trust telling her everything n anything been friends for 4 years she is amazing always there for me even if she cant get to me in preson then she is on the phone or internet whenever i need her.  makes me smile when im upset makes me feel better when guys put me down, tells me the truth of what she thinks of any of my boyfriends when i have one or checks them out like her mini little tests which makes me laugh.    tell each other everything and know that we would help each other though anything that happens.   and knowns that friends are more important then any guy that may mess with us hehe   hope u have found your best friendxoxoxo|`|s5UWohVcaa	friendship is someone who is always there for you! not just when it's convenient for them. True friends are there to help you through the hard times and there to help you shine through the good times. Friendship can be shown in small and large gestures of kindness  but either way a friend should be full of compassion and understanding. Dont worry you'll know a true friend when you see one. but dont forget to look for friendship all around you. because sometimes you'll find the greatest friendships in the most unexpected places!  :D|`|6X2p6Zkwaa	nope  i trust my best friend !!|`|WV36m31Zaa	when visited in the hospital, or jail, other times you need to distinguish between being let down, or trust being broken, as there are different circumstances for each ....|`|o0U2K84oaa	My definition of a friendship: A person that's close to you for a long time.     I have recently went through some difficult times and found out only two of "friends" being there for me when I needed them. Sometimes, we know who truly are our friends and who's not but we just choose to ignore the truth. A friendship is almost as fragile as an relationship. But sometimes, friendship is about forgiving when one has broken your trust, ( as long as they don't keep make the same mistakes) Nothing feels more wrong when you can't make it right with your close friends. But just wait a while before you truly give your heart to your friends but I have to say with my experinces, the person that you have been friend's with the longest, are usually the one that's always going to be there for you.|`|AA12148387	Its a real friendship if that person is honest to you always and wants to be there during the good and bad times no matter what. You will know if this person is trustworthy if they don't repeat other people's secrets. If they don't gossip.
bo4MguzVaa	I don't understand that either.  It's somthing embedded in culture I suppose.  I would say it's shameful to be sleeping around as a man or a woman.  And risky, with all the diseases out there.|`|MYO2k9EUaa	That's kinda sterotypical. I think parents nowadays are way overprotective of both their sons and daughters in ways of sex. <br>  <br>  But its also cultural. Men (sons) are considered stronger and able to mate without difficulty and are praised when they do. <br>  <br>  Women (daughters) are thought of as weak and timid, able to be brainwashed easily, and men do not like their women to be mounted by some other male creature.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Because guys don't get used as often.<br>  They don't get hurt as often<br>  They don't get pregnant... as often <br>  They can hide the fact that they had sex with someone. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just so many reasons. I think dads should let up a little on it but then again if they did, imagine all the young teenage mothers whose children don't have a father... <br>  <br>  And though, I still think that guys should be teaching their sons to wait.  After all, their sons are the reason girls end up as single mothers at the age of 12- over 20.|`|l0xnIquFaa	ik it sucks for girls. im 14 and im still a virgin and plan on staying that way, but i have  brothers and my parents are pretty different with me than they are with the boys.like if my bro who is 22 does somthing with a girl my dad is all 'niiice' but if my dad ever found out about my first kiss he would probably hunt the guy down (thats y mom and me keep it a secret lol) my mom is understanding with me tho, like she isnt overprotective and if i did have sex she would get me anything i needed like birth control. but like i said im 14 and plan on staying a virgin for a while lol
j4pZKCUJaa	As long as he is having safe sex does it really matter. 18 year olds should know what they are doing. Waiting until your married is really old school - you might find out that the sex with the wife isn't what you want and vice versa|`|tRUfMGB1aa	The father's role is usually to teach the male child the ways of being masculine. This including sex.<br>  I'm not saying buy your kid a bunch of porn and tell him to do this to his science parter, but when he finally DOES decide to make the choice, especially at 17 or 18, maybe even 16, it's good to encourage him. As long as he used protection, there's no need to make him dwell on it :]|`|MYO2k9EUaa	If I was a father... that would be the end of the world, lol. <br>  <br>  If I was (knowing I will never be) I'd secretly congratulate him while telling him off in front of the mother. But that's stereotypical. Oh well...|`|VALxlwYSaa	Well, <br>  I think that because he is 17-18 you should let him do what he wants. Don't encourage him, that could make him want to do stupid things like sleep with random girls to get your approval but don't bug him. <br>  <br>  If you have a daughter though, you now know that you have to give her the same respect.|`|9RtdvLEKaa	If you know he's already had sex then the best thing you can do is to encourage him to be safe, have protection and be smart about it and make sure he's only with people that are 18 or older as well!  Other than that, trying to make him stop could just put a huge strain on your relationship right now and he's going to keep at it regardless of what you say.
7UZ8gjXIaa	You know, like anyone else has said on here that you should dress better and what not. The key thing is, you need to dress appropriatly, decent, your hair should always be decent and you must always look "clean" like shower everyday, makesure your face isn't appearing too cake faced or oily. T<br>  <br>  - Then your clothes must look decent and you, honestly, don't need designer branded clothing just be yourself and have your own style. <br>  - Then to make friends, it really isn't that hard. Smile, be yourself, be nice to everyone, don't gossip cause it will come around and bite you. If you talk to someone just once you never know where you could get at. So spark a random conversation or about something around you. Such as being in the cafeteria and asking someone what they enjoy eating and what would be a good pick. Then make friends with your classmates, that's definatly not hard. You've got to live with them through out so many class days, why not become friends right? so spark a convo or get someones msn / phone number / aim / email for something over homework and then just kind of move in and ask to hang out or whatever. The more people you become friends with, the more people are going to start noticing you.|`|pbPe614Raa	copy some jokes from family guy and make yourself the class clown,then everyone will love you.|`|qGOxMYpHaa	speak with a jamacan accent|`|AA11193773	wear a pumkin on your head and skip around wearing nothing but a full diaper and a stained shirt|`|O0udlwfwaa	Yea don't be shy.

Like someone said before, look through magazines. But put your own twist on the styles. Try to use the tips they give you regarding personality and incorporate it into your lifestyle. I know this is overused, but be yourself. Just not the loser geeky self. lol im kidding dont change to much for other people, because if they love you for something your not then at the same time your going to hate yourself for being a good actor!<br>  Best of luck to you!!!!|`|Rtv5aiH4aa	k<br>  as stupid as this sounds.<br>  seriously<br>  this is the key..<br>  look through magazines<br>  really<br>  if you want to be cool<br>  wear what people wear now a days.<br>  good styles<br>  you'll get attention.<br>  THEN <br>  people will see how cool you really are on the inside.<br>  respect<br>  everything<br>  comes after that.|`|LMyJ9pMbaa	You should be a little more outgoing: talk to more people, and befriend them, wear nice clothes, have more confidence, and start random conversations with people that you're associated with at work or school or whatever it is|`|dksB1B0Laa	start 2 dress a little better and speak to more ppl|`|hakmgpVyaa	hey hey dress as good as u can get so much info totally i mean like so not cool!
52Ob1cf1aa	you sound like a cool person, but i dont know whats up with the other girls because I have never seen them. this is going to sound generic, but be yourself and do what you love. This is difficult to hear at your age, but as you grow older and mature, you will find that having guys pay attention to you is not everything in life, and most of the time is not the best thing to have.|`|Goxj1meyaa	well i always think that confidence is the main thing, make yourself surrounded by people.<br>  get closer with all of your friends so you have great relationships with all of them... but while some of your other friends have mainly girl friends you should get to know guys by saying hi and talking to them more over IM.  get alot of guy friends so you can hook people up and play matchmaker... people will notice you.<br>  <br>  key is to be charming and yourself, dont let anyone tell you different<br>  good luck!<br>  :)|`|urQnRQ4jaa	Its usually in there personality...you can change your personality but you shouldn't want to because then you will be changing who you are and that's bad...I think that you would stand out in a crowd of people in a good way...try not to be insecure about yourself just embrace who you are and run with it...if people don't like you then its there loose not yours...|`|muk4bPPhaa	Get a "thing".  Something that is all your own.  Really easy ones would be going to an unpopular clothes store (no one else will have what you get or know where you got it) and finding a crazy, but stylish, scarf, or jacket, or something noticeable.  Wear makeup in a crazy/ unusual way, but cute, like extending eyeliner into a small spiral.|`|yIkGF2HIaa	Well you can do what I did at ur age and let the inner you break loose.<br>  That's how I got to stand out. I let myself do and say and wear whatever I wanted. Whatever kind of clothes or wild make up I thought was cool, i wore. whatever phrases and and words i learned, i used. And whatever i felt like doing. Thats what u should do. Break apart from the croud and be ur own person. Don't give a hoot what anyone thinks.|`|uRqm4Bxcaa	This is stupid.

Have your adopted parents been good to you?  Have they always treated you with love and respect?  If so, then what's the problem?!  In my opinion, what makes a family is when people are there for you when you need them and love you unconditionally.  You can ask them about your adoption but realize that you shouldn't get upset with them because they love you and consider you to be their son.  I would talk to them before meeting with the person who contacted you, though.  Just my advice...  Good luck!!!|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	i am sorry you are having such a hard time.<br>  <br>  i can't say i know how you feel because i was not adopted.  i am wondering if you might approach your school counselor for help and advice?

If they've supported you this far, they will continue to.|`|7obFZ2Gyaa	Accept it  and  tell your parents about it .   Then  see if you can find your real parents  if you want to  that is !!

If you do this, I think things would be easier for the two of you with his parents.  <br>  <br>  You're only 16 and 15 years old, you and can't expect to be with him 24/7 or to text him 24/7.

You would see the two actors, but once it got down and dirty, it was his manhood she was working or being worked over by. She then turned to mostly lesbian porn. I think he was the jealous type.|`|BEoHK8V2aa	Well, to me obviously, people only become you know 'porn stars' because they need money or whatever, and they don't know what else to do, so if a guy really loves one, and she loves him- I think he would be able to get her out of that type of buisness and take care of her so she wouldn't actually have to do that anymore. Anyway, that's just my opinion- and I am a minor, but I thought this Question was intresting so I decided to answer.|`|H4bYFqwPaa	like any other job in the world, you tend to hang around people that do the same type of work. that's how you meet people and marry them. most porn stars date and marry people in the porn business. some actress marry the camera man. or the director. some marry other porn stars. take janine lindumulder for example. she was married to a camera man and only did lesbian scenes. she would only do scenes when her husband was the camera man for the shoot. when she got divorced, she started doing boy/girl scenes. different people handle it different ways.|`|eXIiXT2Laa	Trash with trash.<br>   Trash does not care being insulted, they don't do anything wrong, that's what they think,  they don't know anything better, or they don't want to know.<br>  Every thing can happen there , they are in their  own world, like in a fantasy.

There are couples who agree that they won't be monogamous and even though I'm sure they get jealous at times, they manage to deal with it.  This is a personal choice and probably not many people can actually handle that, but there are people who can and prefer to live that way.|`|52Ob1cf1aa	i have heard sometimes they marry like producers or something sometimes. but after they get married, that career slows down, unless they are strapped for money. lol|`|Ggtccfhhaa	dude straight up that is so grows no offense to any porn stars out there...but no way no how could i marry a porn star....i think it would be very awkward to know that other guys prolly jack off to vidz of your wife....its just grows

It is difficult to comfort someone when they are depressed and devastated. About all you can do is reassure them of your feelings for them, and express your confidence in him to be able to endure and to find another job or a way to make ends meet. (There are always people who need to have their grass mowed, lawns taken care of, sidewalks shoveled, etc.)<br>  <br>  It is not your fault that you don't know what to say to your bf.

I don't like to discuss things with hubby that upset him either.  But someone told me something a long time ago that helps 2 people not to argue, and that is try starting out your sentence with "I'm sorry that you feel that way" when he's taking his frustrations out on you.  This friend told me to continue using those words at least 3 sentences later and you wouldn't believe how much that will do to stop an arguement.  Best of luck to him on finding another job :)|`|jEC8Ctp5aa	Your boyfriend of 3 years (why three years and no engagement, by the way?

You say that you don't know what to say, but you're doing all the talking right here right now to 'us' all you have to do is say what you're saying here to your boyfriend. It's that simple. <br>  <br>  As long as you say what inside your heart without hesitation, he'' definitely feel your frustration and your care towards him. (yeah it sounds corny, but its true)<br>  Well yeah apologize to him for what you didnt do, explain how angry you are at yourself for not knowing what to do "I feel frustrated when you're sad. I get more frustrated when I can't do anything to help you"-- note this is what YOU said :) and then reassure him by saying you'll always be there and maybe say it was a stupid job anyway (that's if the job was bad). Then do something practical, e.g. help him look for a job, help him pay the bills, let him stay at your place etc. <br>  <br>  (: Right now your boyfriend needs support and comfort. Just show him this whole heartedly. It might feel a little awakard comforting your boyfriend for the first time, but as long as you do it in a nice manner, I'm sure he'll feel your support and you would gain some confidence in comforting others in the future.<br>  <br>  hey good luck. I'm sure he'll feel better if you just try to support him through just some simple words. Best wishes.

miqVrrOxaa	I most definitely agree with you. I am sick of seeing young people label themselves "emo" and cut their wrists for the sheer sake of being "cool". All they want is attention and it seems contradicting, since if they actually DID have depression and have hurt themselves, then they wouldn't want anyone to know. They wouldn't be broadcasting it to the world like that.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, this girl is behaving immature and exaggerating things for attention.

I am not interested in guys who have addictions. I am not interested in guys who are more emotional than a pregnant woman and I am not interested in a guy who smothers me. I am not interested in a guy who wears tighter pants than I would. I don't care if he drinks or smokes pot but smoking cigarettes are gross! A guy who has time, who has time to see me, has time to hang out. Not a cheapskate. A guy who likes to have fun, and go places every once in awhile. A guy that does silly stuff with you and wouldn't mind. Taller than me of course, not freakishly tall though. A guy that doesn't wear tighter pants than me. A guy that would hold your head while he kisses you sometimes, I find that very cute. I’m a sucker for guys who can play an instrument. Understanding, sweet, cute, respectful, not stuck up, exciting, flirty (with me of course, hopefully not other girls). Trustworthy, can trust me, someone I can open up to without being judged, a guy who knows when something is wrong, somewhat sarcastic. Artistic/creative, unique. Good hygiene. Non womanizer please! A guy that’s not afraid to hug me or kiss me or say I love you to me in front of his friends. A guy who wants a long relationship. A guy who can control himself. A guy who doesn’t have more emotions than I’ve ever had in my life. Please don’t be extremely emotional. A guy that can make me smile and laugh and such. A guy that won't lead me on. A guy who actually cares. A guy that won't lie to me about stupid stuff. It'd be nice if he could think about me every once in a while. A guy that smiles when he tells his friends about me or when he talks about me. Intelligence would be good. A guy who would be there when I needed him. Someone grown up. But most of all a guy who I can be myself around, who will be there, who will care and be my best friend and won't break my heart.|`|231ed519d902be3d54c3f6aebaa88058aa	confidence, not cocky. funny, but don't try too hard. smart, but not know-it-all, and sweet, like plan a date yourself and get her your own original gift without her telling you to.|`|UeScekl2aa	personality<br>  smile<br>  loooks.|`|VgjALTN8aa	Men that act more mature and are romantic.
dd1ed523a17927679c4955f404f3e139aa	The tradition of common-law marriage was affirmed by the United States Supreme Court in Meister v. Moore (96 U.S. 76 (1877)), which ruled that Michigan had not abolished common law marriage merely by producing a statute establishing rules for the solemnization of marriages. Since Michigan did not require marriages to be solemnized, the court held, the right to marry that existed at common law existed until state law affirmatively changed it. The Court held that in order to bar common-law marriage, a state's general marriage statute must indicate that no marriage would be valid unless the enumerated statutory requirements were followed.<br>  <br>  Common-law marriage can still be contracted in 11 states and the District of Columbia, can no longer be contracted in 26 states, and was never permitted in 13 states. The requirements for a common-law marriage to be validly contracted differ from state to state. Nevertheless, all states – including those that have abolished the contract of common-law marriage within their boundaries – recognize common-law marriages lawfully contracted in those jurisdictions that still permit it. The Navajo Nation allows common law marriage and allows its members to marry using tribal ceremonial processes as well as traditional processes.[8] Some U.S. states, however, such as Colorado, more rigorously enforce public policy exceptions to their general duty to recognize foreign state or foreign country marriages valid where entered into in the case of common law marriages.<br>  <br>  There is no such thing as "common-law divorce" – that is, you can't get out of a common-law marriage as easily as you can get into one. Only the contract of the marriage is irregular; everything else about the marriage is perfectly regular. People who marry per the old common law tradition must petition the appropriate court in their state for a dissolution of marriage.<br>  <br>  Texas, however, permits common law marriages to be effectively annulled, if not established legally within a specified time after the parties separate. Likewise, common law legal presumptions that a person who obtains a marriage license has obtained a divorce from all prior marriages before remarrying, in the absence of proof to the contrary, can have a similar practical effect.<br>  <br>  While a number of U.S. states recognize either same sex marriage, or domestic partnerships with the same legal incidents, as marriage, no U.S. state currently recognizes same sex common law marriages, and the Federal Defense of Marriage Act permits any state not to recognize same-sex marriages from another state.|`|2WKN9kZiaa	the only way to be officially married is to get married!! tell your friend to quit being so dumb and hard headed!!|`|IvMPh09baa	yes there is a law... i believe its called common law marriage?<br>  <br>  check on it.<br>  <br>  but yes, after 7 years of living together and sharing expenses you are seen by the law as married.|`|OG4410bdaa	there is a thing called a common-law marriage<br>  <br>  however he's got his facts ALL wrong<br>  - common law marriage is only recongized in 16 states, not all 50<br>  - you don't just date the person for a certain time period; you actually have to live with the person, share expenses (and have a sexual relationship while living with them) for a certain time period (usually 7-13 years depending on the state)<br>  - most states require you to file for taxes as being married before your common law marriage is considered "legal"<br>  <br>  here check out these links for the specifics-<br>  <a href="http://www.unmarried.org/common-law-marriage-fact-sheet.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.unmarried.org/common-law-marr...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_law/common_law.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.expertlaw.com/library/family_...</a>|`|qdsVS1dDaa	Not in any of the fifty states.

Meaning that you have been together living in the same home etc for so long, that both of you have contributed to the relationship. This usually comes in to play once you decide to break up and one of you tries to sue the other for money or items you aquired while in the relationship. Unless that happens, the state could careless how you live or who you live with. <br>  <br>  Here is an example: If you have a credit card and you put his name on it and he max's it out, then you break up, the credit card company will not hold him liable for anything. It will be all on you. BUT...if you were married, then both of you would have to figure a way to split that debt and it becomes legal at that point.|`|xnhwmontaa	COMMON LAW MARRIAGES ARE STARTING TO DISAPPEAR.

Try to just act not into her and hope she breaks up with you. Don't do anything like cheat on her because that would def. upset her brothers. Just try to talk to her and tell her she needs to not be so obsessive (don't say it like that). Tell her you feel like she doesn't trust you and that you need time to yourself sometimes. For your sake I hope she dumps you, good luck.|`|U33q6Xlnaa	The word you are looking for is clingy. If her brothers are threatening you, you need to go o the authorities and report it.

DIdyuwTwaa	he was your ex. sounds like hes moved on. why dont you as well? if it breaks your heart to do so, then wait and see if he picks off his new gf, if he does, jump on him. meanwhile, dont hang out with them. i dont see what good that will do apart from making you feel worse.<br>  <br>  good lucky honey.<br>  xxo.|`|8XqD6xSCaa	if its meant to be he will come back to you if not its best for you to move on :)<br>   and in the meen time don't go on dates with your friend and the boy you will only make yourself more upset|`|mKs1cClqaa	sabotage their relationship. period. <br>  <br>  nothing else to do|`|MHTIe6hTaa	ITS OVER!<br>  <br>  you have to let him go...you can't make him like you.|`|IaK4SRHpaa	Why are you going out with your ex even if its with a group of friends in the first place?

But that's just me.<br>  <br>  Just try and remember he's an ex for a reason and don't go out with him and her any more if you know they are going to be there until you can get over him.

Ok so:<br>  1. try the mentos with coke thing (they would like that)<br>  2. look up crazy sports that you never knew exsisted and learn how to play them and show it to your viewers<br>  3.

Stick up for the boy and tell those mean kids that instead of them picking on him, they should take the time to get to know him. You can't judge someone because of the way they look. If they don't want to be his friend, then you be his friend. He'll appreciate you for it. Good luck.|`|eec8wAAKaa	Cause he's different.

I also believe they deserve the same rights as straight people.|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	fine by me, though i do sometimes feel a little awkward around an abnormally large crowd of homosexuals, but i think that's just because i'm just not used to it.|`|49da283ad6f82d6c3ae5e2b5847bbf08aa	Homosexuality rulez.

GsrLh50laa	It depends on which county you file in, but California does have a form you can use to waive the filing fee. It's called a "Application for Waiver of Court Fees and Costs". Don't count on getting your fees waived though. If you need more information about the process or the form and everything else you need to file your own divorce in California then visit - <a href="http://www.legalformsbank.biz/uncontesteddivorceforms.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.legalformsbank.biz/unconteste...</a>|`|E7RhMRKhaa	The court filing fees are somewhere around $400.  Call the court house , they will tell you.  Actually it is an annulment.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	I am sorry to hear that things did not work out between you and your spouse.  I am glad that through this difficult time you are able to find a way to resolve the pain without causing additional suffering for each other.<br>  <br>  In terms of cost, I would estimate an amicable divorce to cost between $250 and $400 if you use an aid service, and perhaps less if you avail yourself of county courthouse self-help programs.  This does not include the courthouse filing charges, which might vary from county to county.  Filing charges may cost a few hundred dollars.<br>  <br>  There are many forms required for a California divorce.  While it is a no-fault state, the California divorce process can be complicated, even when there are no disagreements between parties.  If the forms are not filled out properly, the process can be delayed or not completed.  The divorce laws are written to ensure that both parties' rights are protected and the judges work to make sure this happens.<br>  <br>  You might try an online site which will walk you through the process, especially if you are still on speaking terms. <br>  <br>  I recommend first going to the California self help website.   The address is attached below.  This will walk you through the California process in great detail.  If, after having read this you want additional help completing all the forms, you might try a site such as Complete Case to help you fill out the paperwork.  You might also try to seek assistance through a paralegal, which would be considerably cheaper than through walking through the process with a mediation lawyer.  <br>  <br>  Good luck to you both through this difficult time.|`|NJXBOx4Maa	$320 to file the initial divorce papers in California.<br>   <br>  If the spouse files a Response with the court he/she would have to pay an additional response/appearance fee of $320.  A response fee is not charged if its a CA summary dissolution or if the case enters default.<br>  <br>  Many California counties provide a Family Law Facilitator to provide free legal help.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	From what I remember, the court filing fees are not based on how easy or how difficult the divorce is. The fees vary by state, and by county. When I filed it was around $300.<br>  Its best to check with the court you're filing with, because each county has a different filing cost.|`|8ZGuOuvAaa	$1|`|UTVWZnRWaa	I just got divorced last year here in california we did not fight over anything. In my county they have a SHARP office in the court house<br>   which are paralegals they help you for free. All you have to pay are the court filing fees which cost me 320.00

Your boyfriend could get into some legal trouble if you and he are involved sexually. There is no law prohibiting dating, as long as no sexual contact takes place.|`|2jyrDNljaa	It's completely fine to date him if you know him well and trust him. You might not want to be alone with him at first double date or go somewhere that's really public. If you say you've known him for a while then it should be fine if you guys go out just don't let him take advantage of you or use you or anything. You might also want your parents to check him out? If your parents think he's okay then no doubt hes probably a good kid.|`|AA11605508	To answer your question: yes, you can date. However, what is it about this guy that makes him so attractive to you?  And what is it about you that makes you so attractive to him? <br>  <br>  The main way he could get into trouble is via statutory rape laws.  There's also the possibility of child molestation charges, though this would be slim. <br>  <br>  Honestly, if you were my daughter, I would be asking to meet him. A seventeen year old can't find a girl closer to his own age to go make out with? That's suspicious.|`|Eo0oeZMTaa	The only way he could get in trouble is by you. If anybody finds out he did something sexual to you then they can get him in trouble. So if something does happen it has to be private, and YOU have to keep it sealed. Keep in mind he will only be subject to the law when he turns 18 and that can be any sexual act, not just sex. so for now he is safe but I wouldnt advertise what you 2 do to anybody because you see how people responded on here, they probably will act the same way in person. I wont comment on my opinion of 13yr old dating a 17yr old because it sounds like u heard it all already, but just be careful|`|MlCWsBcwaa	If you don't care about the age gap, then you should care about him going to jail as an 18 year old adult for going out with a young teenage girl.  Does not matter if there is sex or not, even if he does not end up in jail, it will wreck his life if he gets into trouble - and you would never be able to see him again, think about it.  I know this would seem real and the feelings very strong, but come on - three years ago you were 10.  You are not old enough for an adult relationship, which is what this guy is just about ready for.  I think you need to keep things as friends for the time being and see how things go.  Feelings for love and things are stronger than you think and you can still get into trouble that way without meaning for it to happen (which is only one of the reasons why the law says it is not okay for you to date an adult).  Good luck, seriously, I hope things go well for you (but if it is with this guy, not until you are the age he is now).|`|TZkyrnlyaa	Well love works in mysterious ways.<br>  Unfortunately we cannot choose who we love. Love is what it is and I hope that many understand that.<br>  Back on topic, no you cannot get in trouble however, as soon as he turns 18, you cannot have sex with him. Well you can but don't let anybody find out. <br>  Good luck.<br>  Cheers.|`|Ym90xu59aa	I ain't sparing you the "he's too old for you talk". HE IS TOO OLD FOR YOU.  He's even too old to be friends with you. <br>  <br>  <br>  I don't know the limitations in Ga. but geez, the boy needs a life.<br>  <br>  Rebuttal:<br>  <br>  You are 13 years old. You need others, perhaps your parents, to make your decisions for you. However, since you came here to ask us of our opinions, we will play the part of your parents and still tell you that you are not old enough to make rational decisions. You are just now becoming a teenager and you think you know it all? You're susceptible. You're vulnerable. In all essence, You really don't want to hear the truth. So, if you wanted to hear the truth, this was not the place to go. <br>  <br>  Tough love, baby.|`|t4ebT9araa	i dont think you'll get in trouble yet...<br>  but if it continues to when he's 18, <br>  i think he can get in trouble. <br>  idk what the consequences are. <br>  and i know that you dont think he's that kind of guy, <br>  who only wants sex, <br>  but i got involved with an 18 year old earlier this year.<br>  i'm 15. <br>  and i thought he was the sweetest thing ever.<br>  and turns out thats all he was interested in.<br>  seriously, <br>  some guys are major sweet talkers.<br>  just be careful<br>  best of luck!|`|JJMa25NWaa	no, he's not a legal adult, so you guys are fine. and either way, im 14 and my boyfriend is 18, even though he is a legal adult, we can still date as long as we don't have sex, and i don't plan on that.|`|nAMBqhv1aa	hey :] <br>  im in a relationship with a guy kinda, and he's 17.<br>  im 14.<br>  He wont get in trouble, yet. <br>  I know 17 is safe, i just don't know about 18.. <br>  <br>  good luck! :]]|`|9dCFYwb5aa	Theres nothing that permits you from doing that, but..Honestly.

I'm sorry I can't understand it cuz I just focused on school in middle school.|`|dpwMHg8maa	i believe the rule on that is you are allowed to date, but it really depends on your parents. Because you are not 16, and he's so close to being 18, a legal adult, your parents could potentially call the cops and report him as a rapist/ child molester, or even a pedophile.  <br>  <br>  I believe that is how it goes, please anyone correct me if i am wrong on that one...|`|Agt5JpTZaa	You're 13 and in GA?<br>  Me too lol. Weird.<br>  Well...would you get in trouble?<br>  With who, your parents?<br>  Probably. Mine would never let me.<br>  But, if you REALLY like him and know that he won't force you into anything you don't want to do, such as sex, then what the hell...go for it lol. <br>  You might get in trouble though if your mom doesn't want you dating him and she finds out that you are.<br>  You should probably talk to her about it first to avoid whatever consequences might come later.<br>  <br>  :]|`|jD1xacNbaa	Same how I feel, I'm 13 and I like a boy but hes 16<br>  Its only 3 years apart so I dont see any problem|`|s8S5FsgPaa	woahhh slow down ur too young to date ur only 13! hes 18 years old thats weird|`|VnumG8mcaa	yes but it is too early to be in bed wait at least 5 years|`|td6WXhv4aa	Yeah he is too old and you shouldn't be having sex your too young!|`|0g0PZmXYaa	legally, yes. But once he turns 18, and has sex with you(if you do) it's considered rape even if your the one who suggested it and your parents can press charges if they want. So be careful! Hope I helped!|`|kA7GEKf7aa	Next year you're basically screwed when he turns 18 and don't give me that sh*t about "he loves me and doesn't want to have sex". You think that now, but guys always go for the younger girls with one thing in their mind. Have some common sense before it's too late.|`|J5KpCgeEaa	Once he turns 18 it will be illegal.|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Eh you shouldn't care what other people think, I think that it's quite an age differnence but it's your life. Have fun and stay safe :]|`|QHASqNDtaa	I guess. But be careful okay?|`|8pw8qDjPaa	i have an issue with your age alone. i think 13 is too young to date. i think i was too young to date at 15!! i didnt know what the heck i was doing! be a kid while you can!! and take your time growing up!!<br>  <br>  and guys at that age... sorry to say, but they're extremely immature and do only want sex. i dont care how well you know this guy (how well can you know a guy if you met him when you were 10? you're just a kid! your judgement in people can't be that good yet! especially older boys!)<br>  <br>  age doesnt matter... once you're mature enough. and at 13, i'm sorry, but you are not mature enough for this relationship (and neither is he!)|`|dk8y4eseaa	Well, people might judge why he's dating a girl 4 years younger than him. To save you both from all the embarrassment and dirty talk, I think you should stick with guys your age. He's good for a buddy or friend but I think 17 is taking it a bit too far. It's just my opinion, take it seriously if you wish.<br>  But whatever floats your boat.|`|sZ1xbQXlaa	good for you for not caring. i as well am in that situation of people criticizing me and my bf im 14 and hes 18 ,its not illegal for you guys to date or havve sex once hes 18 it will be illegal to have sex but not to date. good luck and good job ignoring the skeptical people:-)|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I doubt it.<br>  <br>  At 13 kids' sense of romance (or eroticness, for that matter) have not yet fully developed.  That generally happens around 16.  <br>  <br>  In my opinion, a 17 year old girl deserves more than a 13 year old guy.|`|ELOWvAaLaa	uh in my opinion, thats a big age difference. once he turns 18, he could be held responsible if something goes wrong. so....good luck!|`|o6uwV66jaa	CAN you date..yes..<br>  is it werid..Absolutly..|`|KwWwB22Zaa	your 13, you arent smart enough to keep a guy off you. <br>  <br>  i would stay away, thats bad news.|`|67EaIAvbaa	your dad is gonna kick his azz!
jZ1g2pahaa	it doesn't matter if HE wants you to, i would say ask him out anyways.<br>  <br>  Whats the worst that could happen?<br>  He says know and you realise he doesn't like you that way. At which point you can stop wasting time on thinking about  going oout with him, just be friends and live ur life without that hell.<br>  <br>  Or he could say yes and u could have the time of your life.|`|Ig61vCA6aa	from the details u desribe, not yet the ripe pick from the bananas. or just saying he not droppin enuff hints.<br>  good luck.|`|urQnRQ4jaa	I would ask him if I liked him and if he says no then ok well move on...|`|mKs1cClqaa	the friend could be f'n with u or telling the truth<br>  <br>  just dont act rashly|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	sounds like it and it has to be you to ask.|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	Just sit down and talk to him, ask him how he feels about you.

And if ur like 5 why are u evn on yahoo answers kid?
bYvGNvrvaa	Honestly i'm in the same situation with my friend, and there really isn't anything you can do about it but support her and let her know your there for her. If she's going deny it then there's nothing the police or cps can do about it.|`|oFYzfEPzaa	you should tell your friend that it is for her best. also go to her house with her and make her momabuse her. when she does, stand up for your friend and fight back and protect her. your friend will get the idea taht you are doing this for her best and tell her to do something about it like call the cops. you wont apear selfish but rather heoroic.|`|CXjgK3Lfaa	I Say ..

vR4k5iVCaa	first of all i understand what your going through cuz i've been there but the worst thing you could do is not tell. i didn't tell because she was my only friend and i mean only. but because i didn;t tell i lost my friend anyways because she died from her mom smaking her to hard. it's a long story but it saddens me every time i think about it. i mean talk to your mom/dad about the situation because that should be the people that no matter what you can talk to . try to find out if she has any other trust worthy family members that could take her in and report her mom. she's 15 that means she got 3 yrs till shes 18 and she can get out on her own voice your concerns to your parents and see if maybe she could stay with you. whatever you do DO NOT KEEP IT TO YOURSELF BECAUSE YOU DONT WANNA LIVE WITH THE REGRET OF I WISH I WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING LIKE I SHOULD OF good luck baby and i'll keep you and your friend in my prayers|`|Id4aSqrPaa	the mom is smart and is getting more aggressive to wear her down more and let her know she cannot fight back *b/c mom fears she could fight back once shes bigger and stronger* the next time she gets hit let her come to your place. take pics of the bruises. let your parents in on it. call the police and child protective services. she needs to get out now before the mom escalates further b/c she will. just let your friend know she will be safe with you and your family... help her out now before its too late.|`|Ig61vCA6aa	as long no marks are made, ur friends mom is not much in trouble but the choking part is very disturbing of a mother to her daughter. Is there a good reason for the punishments?<br>  <br>  I suggest u dont because my friend's parents left him a bruise on his face and teachers questioned him and he told the truth and deifes or whatever had a long talk and meetings with the parents|`|iXgZHsXsaa	I think the best way youguys can sent her mom a letter  and ask her to stop doing it immediately otherwise you will report to Police and Social Agency. <br>  <br>  good luck|`|0Al8AV3vaa	Tell an an adult you trust or call the police.<br>  <br>  It"s for her own good.-_- ._.|`|E7TkNO00aa	Talk to a school counselor or a family friend or relative of your friend. Okay, so she is not bruising her, but why the hitting all these years? The choking part is unacceptable. A mother is not a mother if she is hurting her kid. It might be for the best if child services gets in the action. Don't think that you are going to lose your friend by telling, think of it that you are saving her life. Good luck.|`|YLajQcFkaa	All you can do is either report SUSPECTED abuse to any person of authority in her life besides her mother naturally.  And OR find out where she can go to report it and how she will be taken care of if/when she is taken away from her mother.  The biggest reason why children don't report abuse is the mystery of what will happen to them when they are taken away from their guardian.
74008e5e3a8a4192f40444bc93d2b1c2aa	Bc we are complete opposites. Men think in a totally different way then women do (scientifically proved). Women are moody and can hold a grudge as long as rip van winkle slept, we are more emotional. Men are just the opposite. Don't get me wrong we have similar characteristics but when it comes to daily problem processing we go together like fish and land. (there is only like one type fish that can walk on land, the rest are normal in a since) you rarely get a guy who can understand a girl well, and in the same way you rarely get a girl who understands a guy well. Its all about biology. And sadly it is how we are put together all we can do is learn to be patient and open with each other. You don't have to understand the opposite sex but you have to accept them.. because they wont change, they can't.|`|xYacZrTLaa	ITS NOT LIKE WE ARE BIPOLAR|`|NB1cbRm0aa	they're not smart enough to understand <br>  <br>  IT'S REALLY THAT SIMPLE.|`|mLdlFhyqaa	I don't think so; I understand them quite well.|`|ise05jjUaa	Well for me its all the hints you women give us men rather then coming out & saying exactly what it is you want.  Its not that we're not smart to figure out what you want, it just gets frustrating trying to figure out what you want & when we don't get it right you get mad.  Who's fault is that really, just say what you want it would make things so much easier for you & for us.  Believe me, its not that we don't care what you want, but as a man I've got so much things running through my head as far as being the man of the house & being looked up to to take care of my family & provide for them I don't have time for all these games of trying to figure out what you want.  For some reason a lot of women, not all women, but a lot of women can't just come out & say what they want.  The constant mood changes as well don't help either, you finally think you're doing something right then she turns around & says you did it wrong, never ending.|`|DeQtow3Baa	Us guys are wired differently than you gals.  So more than likely your bf sounds serious by what you said.  But he's interested in you, otherwise he wouldn't have bothered you to say that. If you have a brother or male-cousin that would definitely help you if you ask him too.|`|A0VCoGZ6aa	because we're emotional. why do women think men are hard to understand? because they're hard-wired to be stimulated visually, crave physical closeness with a woman while we generally want to be held and touched and have a guy whisper sweet nothings in our hear.|`|9UQlhzitaa	easy question<br>  <br>  you think most times on emotional levels,and how it will effect your emotional security<br>  <br>  we guys tend to think as problem solvers and on the physical level; we are all about action.

RK04Jktraa	Tell her to keep it a little more discrete, otherwise, there really isn't a huge problem here. Certain people don't like each other, the fact that she wants to share her feelings with you just means that she is comfortable with being your friend.|`|Zirwfsg4aa	Tell her to stop, remind her that you don't talk about her behind her back and if she has a problem, take it up with the other girl...then change the subject abrubtly|`|cKHr7ZYtaa	well talk to the friend that is talking about the other one, and make sure to stop her before it becomes a big problem, maybe she'll understand....if she's a real friend, she would'nt be talking about someone else behind their back.

If you do, then just change topics, if you dont agree stand up for your friend.  Tell the other person that you dont agree and that you arent going to talk about them behind their back. If that friend cares about you, they will listen to you and stop talking about the other friend. Just dont continuing to talk about her, even if you do agree. Just imagine the other friends face if she heard what you were saying.|`|AA11306889	you need to have them talk it out. if they are truely friends they should be able to talk out their problem in a calm way. if it results in a fight, then the friendship could be over.

Remind him that drugs will only bring him down and that he is better then that. If he really isn't trying to quit then just stay away from him because it isn't worth it. Maybe suggest that he gets help in an outpatient rehabilitation center. I work at a hospital and we have a program that kids come to and get off drugs, like a therapy program.|`|8umPjHVeaa	It's not your role to be his "motivation".

qRKOWgS0aa	Make sure you take care of all of your personal hygienic matters first. Take a shower every day, wear deodorant (Axe is preffered...but not too much! Girls love it when you walk by and they can smell a hint of it on you but some girls may not like it.), etc. <br>  Find the girl you want to flirt with. If you are sitting next to her, you can simply start talking to her. Compliment her, tell her how good she looks, etc. Just remember not to say anything that might put her off, especially if you've never talked to her. Just pretend she is like one of your "guy" friends. Don't treat her exactly like this or she will feel like you don't care that she is a girl and are desprate for a new guy friend. <br>  If she isn't nearby, try to get her attention and when you do, look at her for a few seconds. Don't stare hard, or she will be a little creeped out. You then can start mouthing a conversation with her. Do not stare at anything below her face. The eyes and the lips have the best effect. <br>  Act like you have done this before. Be sure to show you are confident, just don't act stupid or insecure. <br>  Be cool, don't stress. there is always someone else ! <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] TipsIf you are sitting across the room, and you catch her staring at you, make eye contact and SMILE and mouth a conversation to her if she is interested in you she will keep mouthing a conversation too! <br>  Likewise, if you like her, and she catches you staring at her, smile, and try to keep eye contact for at least 3 seconds. <br>  Just talk to her and don't be shy|`|1o3OqSioaa	Act interested in another girl,( get a girl who's a friend to play along and who will act very attracted to you), and watch your crush's reaction. Sometimes, seeing another girl interested in a guy that one is not absolutely sure that they like, makes that guy seem so much more desirable. That's one approach that could work.<br>  Another more direct approach is to just simply ask her why she acts that way towards you, is it just you or all guys in general? Be direct and show no fear. Girls like guys who are confident and not afraid of them. That gets respect, and then she'll feel like you are doing her a favor by talking to her.<br>  Good luck,<br>  Lizzie|`|eR3vBsJWaa	on off thing... maybe it was her period<br>  <br>  if not shes playing with you seeing if you get it right <br>  <br>  some girls play mind games but i think your just at the begging <br>  <br>  wait it out for like i dont know a day or two see what happened and make a move as in a bold sign that you like her or just ask her out|`|mLdlFhyqaa	Try being really gentlemanly with her, WITHOUT exaggerating or anything.

(not in a stalker-ish way or anything though!)<br>   - Does she act differently around you? Is she shier or more flirty, etc? Like, If she's more comfortable around other guys(says anything, does anything, etc) then acts more hesitant or shy around you, she probably likes you. <br>    If she acts exactly the same, Id just tell her and see how it goes.<br>  <br>  You could get a (girl) friend to make a joke to her about you, eg. "So! When are you and 'that guy' gonna date?" (sorry, I dont know youre name)<br>  If she turns white- er, not a good sign. If she blushes, well, hehe.<br>  <br>  If youre shy about telling her how you feel, try just being her really great friend for now! One thing may lead to another, "friendship blossoming", etc. lol<br>  <br>  Remember, people live for like a hundred years, and not EVERY girl you like in the next eighty years or so is going to like you back. You just gotta move on and keep your eyes open for the ones that do.<br>  <br>  p.s. sorry if this was too 'sloppy' for you. I guess Im a bit of a sucker for love. :-)<br>     Good luck!|`|ILkTyqBeaa	ok, keep this little thing between the two of you going for at least four or more days...don't bother her as much as she wants you to, when she tells you to text her, don't. Then she'll maybe realize that she needs to step her game up to get what she wants. Hang around your guy friends and talk to them when she's around, don't take it to far, because she may get mad. But, treat her a little of the same way she treats you, you'll earn your respect from her & at the same time she will hopefully grow closer to you...because it seems as though she really doesn't wanna make the first loveable move, she wants you too..But, go with your heart!<br>  -Jalyn...|`|1WQTxqUmaa	How old are you?  She might not know what she wants, and until she knows for sure what she wants, you won't know if something more is going to happen between the two of you.

In doing that, it makes him feel like he can't come to you if something happens with her and needs someone to talk to or whatever. Just try dealing with her even if you can't stand her.

It seems to me that your friend is lazy and can't do the work herself so she is taking advantage of you. Don't let her, if she is truly your friend, she'll understand that she needs to do her own work. Just talk to her. Good luck.|`|eec8wAAKaa	If she cant handle you saying sorry but i can't then shes a crappy friend. She should look to you for help not look to you to do her work
Eug52iQDaa	How sweet!  I hope things work out well for you two.  The excitement at the beginning of a relationship is pretty intense and it appears you're both there!

His wife and daughter moved across state where he couldn't exercise his visitation rights.  They ended up in court. First of all the Wife has to notify the Court if she moves. Plus the Father has to sign a agreement stating he agrees with the move. He negotiated a decrease in child support payments as part of the deal to sign the paperwork for the court. Also he got mileage for when he visits. He can deduct this mileage from his child support payments whenever he travels to visit his daughter.|`|9eouWphjaa	If you could get the other person to make a written agreement and approval of moving out of state it may be possible but if no I'm afraid not then.|`|dpCsTIEIaa	Not sure about Missouri but in Mississippi the mother has the right to move where ever and it is the father's responsibilty to still pay child support. My hisband's boss is in that situation. His wife moved her and their child to Florida and they pay half and half to have her flown over to see her daddy when it's his turn. Which I think is absolutely ridiculous for the child.

OSwiB6B4aa	Although it may be frightening to call child protection it is a good way to get support for your niece. Support services such as counseling that she may not be able to afford otherwise. Her mother is partly at fault for not protecting her child but also she, too, is a victim of abuse. The mental damage that your niece and her mother have experienced will need support to recover.

It is possible that they will place her temporarily in your home until she turns 18.    Good luck...|`|50aafa74f4cd5c99db769abd5513ca2faa	actually they can't force her to get back hime because she is 17 and certainly not at 18 she can live if she shooses too   I know because my son leave his father house at 16 and no one can't stop him although I had custody but I was out of the state and left them with him because if his drinking he decided that he did not want to be around him, at least your neice will be moving in with you my son move to my house with an adult and the police and lawyer both said that the only person that can make him leave was me since I am the owner, so make sure that he was Ok I fly back and forth to make sure he was aliright   in your niece case she is 18 she can no longer be a ward of the court but if you are willing to take her in no one can stop her from moving out, do somthing now before it is too late  that man seem unstable and your sister seem to be OK to be abuse but it her life not your neice' s she deserve better   GET HER OUT|`|13YVNhfGaa	Yes she can leave at any point she wants the house hold is holding her in danger the police can not take her from a stable home like youres and put her back into a dangous enviorment i wish you and her the best and im sorry to hear about that|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Step up ... go to court to force change or custody of the child.|`|I8szWmVMaa	Once your niece is 18 she can move out whenever she wants and can choose where she lives. Also if you wanter her at your home now, if you call child protective services they are forced to make an investigation whenever they want. Once the girl is 18 she can take all HER money and leave.|`|tWD175Pjaa	I think you sould call well-fair and let them know that this is happening and that she is almost of age ( well in canada 18 is legal) and they may say that she can live with you if you are ok with it. or because she is so close to her birthday talk to the police and ask them what the parents can do if she "runs away" and lives with you until she is 18. I think because she is so close to 18 she can just leave but i would double check just incase. good luck and tell her she don't have to put up with this! Every child no matter the age should be loved.|`|a1uoxczTaa	ur neice is 18 in 3 weeks, either wait until then to have her live with u or just have her live with u now. she is so close to 18 that her parents may not be able to do anything.
xVlTraLwaa	Well that could mean sevral things.   He could be embaressed cause his mom or trying to look cool with his friends  Also you guys liked each other in elementary so things might have changed between they way he feels.    My advise is to try and talk to him  aim  myspace  facebook  in person  txt or call    get him to tell you why and nomatter wat dont stop bugging him till he gets the answer. It works cause my gf does it 2 me when i act weird.

It does say that white is the most striking colour to wear because it will bounce the light, and make your tan look great.  i had a look for turquoise dresses but didn't really find anything: mainly satin slip or prom dresses and they would probably be too hot.    Good luck dress hunting: remember you'll know it when you try it on! x|`|2219815a5f68b0925e6613039b0922b6aa	You should just go for a beautiful sundress.  If you wait until March or April, you'll be able to get a lovely sundress in any color you like at pretty much any store.    I'm getting married in an ankle-length off-white sundress this Labor Day weekend.  We're doing the whole "barefoot bride" hippie thing, so it would have looked sort of dumb to be in a big old poofy white dress if I'm trying to have an outdoor, barefoot thing.

Kids usually learn bigotry, hatred, racism, sexism, etc. from their parents.  So as long as you don't turn into a man hater your son will be just fine.|`|BUET39wmaa	all of us say that after we get divorced and then in a few years you will find yourself wanting a new guy.....    just take your time and don't sweat it.|`|RjpPzbBJaa	That statement  is made probably out of heartbreak and anger. Trust me, I've used it many times as millions of people have. Its understandable for you to want to avoid relationships in the future, especially if you've been hurt a lot.  In all honesty, if you do decide to basically become celibate it could negatively affect your child, IMHO. Your son will need a father in his life to show him how to be a man himself. Yes, he can learn it from male family & friends, however you want to teach him about marriage, relationships, etc. That's hard to show your son how a marriage/relationship should be if you're not in one....

ak36Xk7faa	First of all, this isn't a grammar contest. The typing is probably from being upset or just not good with a computer. With that being said...Trust is one of the foundations in any relationship. Without knowing exactly what the circumstances are, you need to look at yourself, and see what your part in that was. Are you putting yourself in situations where there is cause for the red flags? I personally used to be like him, and it ruined my marriage. He should put some faith in you, if he really cares for you at all. If you love him at al, you should make sure you aren't putting yourself in a situation where it would be questionable. You both should sit down and discuss it. Maybe you should call it quits or maybe not, that is for you two to decide. In a real relationship there would never be any issues with this. I also tend to think that maybe he had a bad relationship before, and that person is making you pay for that. I would do something romantic and talk about it and see where the conversation goes.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	His major trust issues sound more like serious character flaws.  If you've been with him for 5 years and he's still like this he needs therapy and the desire to change.  If he's over 30, don't plan on this behavior changing.  You just might not be compatible.|`|21Wk2mu5aa	You should dump him and find someone who trusts you.|`|vz0tsPStaa	wow.    way to use the spell check.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	LEAVE the idiot!!!! What makes you think things will get better??? They are only going to get worse!!!!! and yes learn to spell or use the check spell??|`|bO2rzfISaa	In my experience, men who don't trust feel that way because they can't be trusted.

LIFE'S TO SHORT.|`|8txWayVnaa	When people show you who they are. . .BELIEVE THEM.  He's not going to change, and would make your life a living hell if you got married.    Break it off and move on.  If not, he will isolate you from your family and friends and attempt to control your every action.|`|AA11792169	In most cases there is a reason people are like that,and it did not start with them.So if you have been lying or keeping things from him/her STOP!!Getting caught lying over something small and dumb is all it takes.Trust is hard to regain.|`|0qAmRjfOaa	He's traits will not improve after marriage.

I can't live w/o it spell check.But instead of reading the question and theeen say something about it...  Anyways...   What u can do is leave.It probably wont change.I have only 3years with mine.And we're marry and we have a child together.He knows he's problem.I try to control me when he gets 'stupid'.but sometimes I blew up too,so we both are up to therapy.  If u don't have nothing that tides you with him,but 5 years? Then leave,you'll get 5 more better years w/o pressure.with somebody that have all ur trust. I know is hard.but this is about you!  P.S: If we still like this in 5+ years,and after therapy.I'm leaving too.It will be for my and my kids good future.|`|0s93q8Ocaa	He's not going to change.  EVER.      You should move on.

AA10874773	your not doing anything that YOU want to do.  why dont you & your hubby agree to have a date nite every week.  just pick a day & stick to it.  and on date nite you cannot stay home - you must go somewhere, even if its a walk thru the park.  otherwise, you two will be so far apart emotionally, you'll never stay together.  another idea is to volunteer some of your free time doing something you enjoy.  your likely to meet people who you have something in common with!|`|vwoqIUR6aa	sounds like you miss being around your friends. have your husband or your parents take care of your kids and go out and have some fun with your friends. you need it sometimes.|`|W1aYIF71aa	No, I don't.|`|58jwkbbSaa	Try looking for churches on your own, and listening to sermons whenever you can get a chance. It seems to me like you're really just tired of everyone else running your life for you. You need to do something to feel independent again, and with God in your life you can do that.   Try looking up Southeast church in Louisville, they have a great preacher who really helps me. And try doing some things for yourself for a change! Maybe go on a shopping trip one day, or get your nails done. Little things can make a huge difference.   I really wish you the best of luck, and I hope I helped. =)|`|atzw0IP4aa	I would get a hobby or passion - look at things that you liked when you were a kid to spark ideas, writing, art classes, etc etc. Get out once a week and take a class. You just are in a rut and need to remember who you are. You are getting stuck in the routine and not having fun.     Practice extreme self care before you put others needs before your own. It is like an oxygen mask on the plane. If you give to everyone else first and have no downtime (find new friends or connect with old ones for spa days) you will have nothing to give, and lose yourself!|`|zdpp7cubaa	I think your husband should make time to do things with you even if it's not the things you and him used to do, you and him could try new things. Also, I think you need to make some new friends, friends who have children also. It would be easier for you to go out with them.|`|txPmR7Npaa	You are entitled to be a happy person.  It is good that you question your life.      Here is a key: "I think I do tend to put others first, but what else do I do? I am a mom and a wife."    Your husband is also a father.  But you seem to take the entire load.  This is not fair for you.  And I am sure that you have no problem taking this role, as long as you felt appreciated and loved.  I think that you do not feel loved or understood.    Now let's go a little deeper.  Being loved is good.  But being unable to live without love is not good.  Only kids really need love to survive.  Or maybe big immature adults.  Unfortunately most adults are just big kids.  We feel insecure, we need love.       I am a proponent of Jung and I am sure that with the help of Jungian analysis you could find the real deep problems that bother you.  What you stated is just the surface.      Therapy would help.  But you need real therapy.  Not all doctors or therapists are the same.  Have you considered online-therapy?  It is more cost effective and you can choose a better therapist that may reside thousands of miles away.  Here are some more info on the subject:  http://www.metanoia.org/imhs/    Go to google and search for start online therapy or online therapy sessions.  If you use your intuition youll find a good solution.    A quick search brought these up.    http://cyberpsych.com/  http://soultherapynow.com/  http://www.sunrisecounselling.com/index....  http://www.headworks.com/index.html    But again.  Use your intuition.  Women are good at this.    And whatever you do my dear lady, keep away from drugs.
89YkHxMUaa	.....crazy and immature.|`|NeTNnvSZaa	A lot of times when a boyfriend cheats on his girl he will suspect her of doing the same thing, doesn't matter how unrealistic it sounds.  He's either paranoid (get rid of him) or sporting a guilty conscience (get rid of him).|`|21Wk2mu5aa	Tell him that you are not going to put up with jealous accusations and if he wants to continue a relationship with you then he better learn how to put an end to that.|`|ma6Re8B1aa	////|`|mefxIQP9aa	Yeah, your bf has got some serious issues indeed. Tell him that he needs to relax and has no reason to suspect you of such things. Tell him he needs to stop being so silly.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	He doesn't  Trust you that's all... And a relationship is not healthy if there is no trust hun...|`|8txWayVnaa	Was this the first time he's behaved this way?  Making these types of accusations?|`|23F70N1Raa	sounds like he suffers from very low self esteem and it is effecting your relationship.  let him calm down and then talk to him.  if there is no trust, you also have no relationship... remember that when you talk to him.|`|OBCvewW2aa	Ooooh, oooh, I know, I know!!    Either you're the jump off and his wife needed him to do something.  Or his jump off seemed like a better prospect for the night.    Either way, he pulled that fight out his hoo hoo girl.|`|P28G0a1Raa	I agree, get rid of him.|`|AA11809359	i think it may have started out as a joke and you misunderstood and it just escalated from there.|`|31d0a24439ecffe20e04cb85a1238aecaa	he doesn't trust you - or he is trying to find an excuse to break up.  I advise beat him to it and break up with him.|`|JugLXUbmaa	your title line says it all.    u are probably a better catch for him than he deserves so he is guarding; he also sounds obsessive control freak    watch out!|`|bKK2fPiVaa	Ok... so he sounds pretty insecure.  But you can't blame this ALL on him.  If you didn't do it, then why didn't you just say that to begin with?  It could have all be avoided.  Not that it's your fault either.  It's incredibly lame to accuse someone of cheating.|`|lcXtN4aLaa	He is obviously insecure about your relationship, maybe he's cheating himself or has been cheated on in the past to make him so wary of the situation, i cant see any other reason why he would completely over react. However, even if you thought it was s stupid question, you should have just said no dont be ridiculous, he shouldnt have asked but it made the situation worse, especially if he was in a bad mood, he obviously already feels unloved.  If you hate him so much, leave him.
cWKAoUcSaa	be frank with ur mom...........|`|17aab5400531185eeea85ec13e69a65eaa	My mum tends to do the same thing. I can't seem to have deep conversations with her because all I get back is "mmm" or "yeah, no" answers. I know exactly how you feel, it is very frustrating when there's no passion or interest in the conversations. Kind of feels like you have to dumb down to a simpler subject!    I think you should definately be open with her. Tell her how you feel she has no interest in what you or your sister has to say. She may have something else on her mind that is distracting her.   You won't end up doing the same when you get older because you already realise how damaging this is for you, so you're already learning from her mistake and trying to fix it. Good luck!|`|I8szWmVMaa	Have a heart to heart conversation with your mom.|`|9UsUGk2oaa	hi, ask mum if you can have some 1 to 1 time. explain to her how you feel. us mums can be a little preoccupied some times and need the obvious stating. maybe ask her if there's anything she wants to chat about too, so it doesn't look all one sided, give and take always works. don't forget to keep your calm. when i was a teenager my mum wasn't to good at listening either, so i use to talk to my aunt, we were very close.  good luck
jO7EiSmeaa	Everything is worth it if that is what's in your heart!  Even if the outcome is divorce, isn't it worth a try?  If you don't, you'll always regret not seeing what could have been.  Life is too short to second guess.  Go in whole hearted.|`|O3fcLsKMaa	HUH???|`|TVz2UoOyaa	if you feel that he's sincere to make your marriage work again and he really loves you and you still love him, then give him a chance..just TRUST him..good luck!|`|b7bb85526b028b7f92b16c8204ed4012aa	Only you two can decide whether your marriage is worth saving. What you talk about falls under those "trust issues" and needs to be solved before getting back together again or nothing will have changed. You two may need a marriage counselorto work out these issues but then if this marriage is worth saving then the means on how to do it wont matter. So the both of you must decide about saving this marriage and make a real committment to do so and then lay out all the issues on the table and take each one at a time and resolve them, no matter how bad or mean they seem or just decide to call it quits if you cant. Good luck|`|55e3858ec5337970fbef5876fc1e5fe0aa	Is it worth fixing, is it worth the effort .. only you can answer this.  If it is than try hard.    If you feel your the only one putting effort to the marriage ... re-evaluate your position.    What ever you choose to do ... be ready and able to act. . . If the lady you see in the mirror is satisfied with having done all she can do ... then your ready to decide.    Just be safe & happy.|`|7cjqT33Baa	I would not get back with that man if he were my husband.  I think it's over and the road is divorce, that is my honest answer.  Telling you that he still loves you doesn't mean anything, if he isn't showing it and you don't feel it.  The fact that he hardly calls you speaks volumes.  Why if that is the case are you contacting him so much?  If he still works with the woman, it will always be a situation and a worry for you.  If he was serious about wanting you back, you'd both start fresh somewhere else or he'd switch jobs as soon as possible.    What has he done to show you he wants you back besides just talk?  It sounds like you are the one that would be doing all the work.|`|YVO3WyU1aa	My suggestion would be to write about your relationship and marriage from the time you first met up until today.  Out of that will come the answer.  good luck|`|8tVuKw4Zaa	You should get back together as friends and feel him out. You know in your heart real quick if he is still in love with you
Amkmles0aa	get up a go get a new home get far away from him now|`|MNuS31nsaa	omg i hate girls like this. i know what its like when people talk lies and turn friends against you. my exfriend/ex boyfriend did that. your best friend probably want to hang with "a new crowd." so you know what? let her. it will be her loss. trust me she will come crawling back when she realizes she made a huge mistake. my friend did that. and she wanted to be frieds again. and i told her i moved on. and thats what you should do to! go hang with some of your no so close friends. they will probably become your new best friends.|`|lSag21xbaa	alright coming from somebody with this past experience, you two were best friends so of course your eventually going to forgive her somehow.you two might say your friends again and patch everything up, but its never going to be the same if you forgive her..youll always have a thought in the back of your head that shes going to hurt you again!! i would go hang out with a new group of people,ones that treat you better...|`|J73L2Dyraa	I truly think shes not a good friend if she can do that to you even if you think shes was a true friend sometimes life has to go on but if you really think she still friend material for you go and have a surious talk with her.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	I don't know you or your former friends, but I think you should take some time to think about how you treated them.  Was there anything you did or said, or anything you didn't do that you should have?  I mean, a lot of time we are willing to blame others for our problems without taking a good, hard look at ourselves.  Could you have forced your other former friends to choose between you?  Could you have alienated your former friends through saying things that are not popular?    If, after you think about it, you can't think of anything you might have done, then I'd suggest you move on and make new friends.  Sometimes people grow apart and fighting with someone is no way to get her to be your friend again.    Good luck.|`|n463milpaa	U know what; ive been there before. im 17 and ive been friends with a bunch of kids since kindergarten, and i thought they would be my friends forever, but as i grew up i grew a little further apart, because well i grew up. i changed so much and they seemed to have been stuck in the same place forever. u know what i mean? i moved on.  my problem it may not have anything to do with this or maybe a lil.  is that i dont keep secrets, like really. if you tell me that so an so is saying all this crap about a friend i will confront my friend and say hay, you know so and so just told me this whats the deal. im a straight up person, but i do have a filter. ( im not as bad a kelly cutrone ( lmao i  luv that girl!)) but that caused people to leave and good for them.    the girl just maybe going through a phase, ride it out. shell be back to you in a while if its just a phase    if not well than the girl needed a change you cant get mad at people who just want more. or something different.    i think it was kind of mean that she turned the others against you, you should confront them if they are lies. just like Gossip Girl. if someone has a problem with someone they always confront each other.    straighten up those rumors and chose the path you want to go down.    dont be desperate for the girl friendship.. just wait.|`|0AOTN962aa	IDK|`|eeQSrlG5aa	i think the best thing to do is confront her. no need to get angry, loud or violent i would just calmly approach her and make her explain why she's acting this way? you could do it in front of people becasue if she's in the wrong then how can she defend herself! also by doing it in front of people you can explain your version of whatever you think happened!! this will make you look like the bigger person as well as it will make everyone realise how petulant that girl is acting!  sorry for the long answer hope it helps!|`|kxFNIktMaa	You can make new friends screw those b*****|`|YkJeYixnaa	oh i know how you feel!im soo sorry...i know you feel like crying in school(lol),ok so the problem is that maybe you do something wrong like over reacting and showing off coz i also wanna break up with my friend coz she does all that,advice:go to them and say "im really sorry what did i ever do to you guyz ill really change myself for you guyz!just tell me what i did...coz i really wanna make up"  hope that helps ..if it doesnt just tell me and ill give you some more advice:)just be happy with what you have okay!
8a8CZqGLaa	"Reception at the Palace" is the same thing as "So This is Love". It might be easier to find "So This is Love" if you want to try that.|`|PAxR2gFdaa	Go to the music store.  I recently got Rodger and Hammerstein's version of Cinderella through my music store.  Just go in and tell them that you want this song; they'll look up the book and order it for you.  It wouldn't be a problem and it'd save you a lot of hassle.

Ff7mCzlPaa	I take it you're legal guardian to your sister?<br>  <br>  First of all, i wouldn't let her babysit my kids.  not for love NOR money.  <br>  <br>  Secondly, i'd take charge of my home, and set limits and boundaries -- which encompass having rules and expecting them to be followed.<br>  <br>  if she can't, there are always foster homes.|`|VALxlwYSaa	I say threaten to kick her sorry but out if she doesn't start acting like a normal teenage girl should. <br>  If she can't even take care of her mouth then why would the guy want her?

ccnH77SOaa	I think that you like men to dominate you and you may find them lashing out and hitting you little exciting and it makes you feel like they are obsessed with you.  Your still a virgin so you haven't experienced much so I think that you are mostly in a curious state right now.  I think that while you are young you will be drawn to men who do lash at you but I don't think that you'd be into a man who would beat you.  There are men who will grab, who will push, and there are the ones who will beat you to a pool of blood.  <br>  <br>  I think you will probably go through a stage where you will like a guy to rough handle you but once you learn what respecting yourself means you will grow out of them.  ( I know  a lot of women who liked it when guys would grab them, lash at them and with time they grew out of it)<br>  <br>  Older men will never take you serious, for an older guy to have a 19 year old girl is like they are driving a sports car around...so you will never find an older guy who will take you seriously.<br>  <br>  I don't think you will become one of those girls who will allow a guy to beat her because I think you are young and going through a stage that will end once you become more experienced in the dating world.|`|tz6ksGFkaa	Sorry, I couldn't read that, it was all one long run on sentence.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	only if you let it happen. its okay to like older men... but not abusive men. it seems like your seeking a father figure. someone who will correct you, punish you when your wrong, and treat you like a child. sounds like the 40yr old guy took advantage of an insecure little girl and you are very lucky it didn't go farther. and if your desperately seeking an older mans approval you will end up in an abusive relationship b/c abuser can sense that insecure personality a mile away and will get you. <br>  <br>  so if your physically attracted to older men so be it. but determine what you also want in that man. being treated like an equal, being special, loved, and being taken care of. once you sort out your feeling, needs, and priorities then you can find a suitable mate.|`|r1yDsEbuaa	I don't want to scare you but....you gotta stand up for yourself and not let anyone control you..or something could happen. please stay away from older men, please, it will only be safer.  i know you feel better with them but its not safe and if its a safe guy, why would he want a girl who is so much younger than him, he must have a plan to get lots of sex from you or abuse you and take control of you.  i have seen too much of those abuse movies and all that.  lol! but seriosuly, its unsafe. the one movie is a college student who has sex with her college professer and he was crazy, she didn't know that, one day he flipped out on her because she spilt a red drink on his important papers, he is seriously ill and crazy, he abused her and she died right there. i think you should be on the safe side and STAY AWAY!|`|E7TkNO00aa	It looks as though you are looking for a dad and not a man honey. This guy had no right kissing you in the first place. It's not bad that you feel more comfortable with a more mature man than with a guy your own age. I'm sure the right person is out there waiting for you. It's just that you are probably looking in the wrong places. Good luck.|`|YLajQcFkaa	No its not usual in the least.  In your case you MAY have "daddy" issues. Some women just like jerk abusive guys and its not abnormal.

Ladpv2Tzaa	yes, you should be upset!<br>  if you're his girlfriend, then he should be proud of you. he should always want to show the world how wonderful you are. :] if he's ashamed of you, then maybe he's not worth it.<br>  <br>  don't break up with him immediately, though. talk to him and let him know that it bothers you when he treats you differently in front of his friends. if he doesn't change, then you should definitely find someone else who appreciates you for who you are.|`|pKzH1cFHaa	You should be bothered by that. Make it clear that he should treat you the same way he treats you when you two are alone when he is with his friends. He could have at least acknowledged you.<br>  <br>  And to the person above, not all guys are like that. My fiance treats me well everywhere we go.|`|QMRq8Cneaa	Hes sweet to you, but your dealing with an insecure dude. If he treats you different at all in any way, or at any time, in any circumstance, then hes not worth it. You can find someone better than that.|`|TLim2pBTaa	If it bothers you then you should definitely say something. The same way he treats you when it's just the two of you is the same way he should treat you when he's around his friends. He doesn't have to be all lovey dovey but he could at least say something or give you a hug.|`|ZRgLHW3maa	I think you should be mad since he ignored you. alot of guys do act different around their friends and thats ok to a point. but they still need to acknowledge you too. if it was me, I would talk to him, and if it doesn't change then leave him.|`|JxUFDutxaa	He's secretly ashamed of you.<br>  But uses you to make out..<br>  Dump him and find a guy who is happy being around you..even when he's with friends...|`|cAPf4kdIaa	i  think you should not be mad at him|`|7RbootLlaa	He ignored you because he is embarrassed by you. <br>  <br>  To meet up at the end of the day, well, his friends are not around now, are they?<br>  <br>  Talking to him about it will most likely have him denying it. So ask him to introduce you to his friends as he's girlfriend. If he says no or tries and avoids the question. Rest assured, you do embarrass him, which is sad. <br>  <br>  Think about dropping him.|`|aOx0U3wKaa	i hate to say it but it probably means his friends have something against you. i once dated a guy whose best friends wold insult me right in front of me so we barely hung out cause he was always with them, and i didnt want to be. we broke it off, and my new boyfriend is not ashamed of being with me in front of his friends. talk to him about it, it may mean something, or it may not|`|a04f6eea39f85b5ffa527a03f651ab24aa	Men/boys are dumb like that. They have a reputation to upkeep. Kissy huggy is not cool in front of the boys. Just tell him how that made you feels and he will know and probably try and work with you.|`|8IbZNRD0aa	all guys are like that!! i hate it!<br>  well dont be mad this time i think you should see if he continues to do it. if he does THEN!! be mad!! kk if you need to e-mail me for anything you may e-mail me at way2cute4u_95@yahoo.com|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i would be upset and many things could cross my mind the the best thing to do is talk to him and ask him why? and he better have a good answer or else i am through with him.. good luck thats just me...|`|9dc7211c44c17097c672d814b9900b0faa	just explain to him that that makes you feel like he doesnt want his friends to know, because thats what it sounds like to me.|`|XI3blPQtaa	yes! hes a jerk and not worth wasting your time on!|`|vEC8s7fhaa	dump him hes just gonna keep blowing u off|`|GsRpZJX5aa	holy hell<br>  yea you should be mad.  i would so frickin pissed off<br>  i had a bf exactly like this....it didnt work out<br>  he was welcoming with his family but not friends<br>  he is either embarassed by you or his friends either way<br>  if its you then he isnt worth it  and if its his friends then they arent true friends. but guys who are really into girls dnt do that...ignoring you completely.....he sounds like a douche    you prob deserve better|`|aEnSqjQMaa	Well its very rude, I mean if he's going to do that, it probably means it wont work out. Maybe he was embarrassed of you or something. Or maybe his friends didn't like you, possibly they didn't want to see him with you.|`|4EgUP271aa	u tell im why did you do that then the next time he does just do it back to him to get the message across if it keeps up hes just a dick no self respect for u just a homo dont bother with him|`|FnnyT1mlaa	Absolutely, you should confront him about it.|`|80Y4DHXsaa	do not go around assuming things. talk to him. if he says your crazy and he has no idea what you are talking about then...<br>  you kick his butt.|`|xX3CBz1Raa	no.... im sure you've done it at a point... but if it really bothers you then tell him to pay more attenion to you

cP03k3cXaa	I have two words for you.....<br>  <br>  BE HONEST!<br>  <br>  Communicate with your parents, put your pride, and your embarassment aside, and be willing to listen to their feelings without being defensive. And remember, this too shall pass, no one is perfect, just explain yourself and move on from there. And apologize for disappointing them. I tell my son all the time, I can't fix the problem if I don't know it exsists. They want to move past the situation as much as you do, so start by talking. Communication is the key, and parents want to talk to their children about anything. Get over your fear, address the situation, and move on.|`|ZIq2IzOmaa	Explain that the song is meant to be funny, not serious. Your parents have heard dirty songs before and they've heard dirty jokes. They need to know now that you understand the song is not serious and that you don't really believe the things being said in it. <br>  <br>  Your parents just want to know that they haven't raised a socially inept weirdo. Let them know by helping them understand why you had the song and what it's supposed to mean.|`|Ff7mCzlPaa	well, blaming it on a friend isn't the way to go, especially if it's yours.<br>  <br>  admit it's yours and let your parents know that you never intended for them to find it.  you might let them know that although it's not a very appropriate song, it's supposed to be humorous and that you really did not mean any harm.<br>  <br>  if i found a cd like that in my kids' car, i'd probably just shrug my shoulders and move on.|`|5Xp59a3Iaa	Haha, okay.<br>  My mom borrowed my car once and my friend's CD really was in it, that group called ICP, and it was BAD. Mom was like "what kind of garbage were you listening to?" and threw the broken CD at me and then felt like an idiot later because my friend made my mom pay her for it.<br>  <br>  Had to tell you that because it sounded so similar.<br>  Just tell your mom a friend was playing it for you because she found and it and was like "oh my god! listen to this!"|`|zAG51Wrzaa	just continue with your story...<br>  if you admit that its your cd they will be even angrier because you lied.<br>  tell your friend about it so she can cover up for you if its necessary.<br>  theres nothing else you can do but make sure your parents know that it was a joke so they dont think bad about you friend either|`|IpL5xCCgaa	sit down with them and make sure there listenin and explain to them that its just a joke and nothing else and u have to tell them that it was u and not your friend|`|pVaZty4Maa	omg were in the yr 2009 where just about every song is dirty lol she will get over it|`|0kseszAKaa	Apologize. Then explain that it was a joke type of thing and u didnt mean to make her dissapointed. Thats all i got for yah :P  ... anywayzz good luck :P|`|Arxs3qXWaa	You could try to explain further|`|E7TkNO00aa	If your an adult,  and it's your car, you are entitled to listen to whatever music you like. You shouldn't have blamed on your friend because how are your parents going to react around your friend the next time he goes over to your house. Don't you feel a little guilty that you blamed this on your friend? You should. If your parents don't say anything to you, then don't bring the conversation up. Good luck.|`|VALxlwYSaa	Make it clear that it was just suppose to be a joke from one of your friends. <br>  <br>  If she doesn't say anything about it then don't worry about it she'll forget about it soon. <br>  <br>  You could also ask why she was going through your CD'S She could have left it alone...
SkgJYDaCaa	The only person you can control is you, cliche I know but it's true. I suggest talking to your mom about your concerns and let her know that you want to have a closer relationship with her. Your mom could have no idea that she is favoring your little sister. I would hope that a mother wouldn't pick favorites with her children. Be honest and do it in a way that isn't angry or judgemental towards your mom or sis, that would just start a fight. Good luck =)|`|dGBbFwFWaa	i think u are craving for love u dont seem to have gotten much while growing up and u see all this with your younger sister making u wonder and feeling more lonely in some ways.. mothers dont always know better and i think she dont realize how much this is hurting u.. talk to your mom ask what can u do to have little more love shown to u.. i am sure she will be shocked  to see that she has been unfair to you.. good luck
XsXokO9paa	Yes, take him to church by all means. You never know what may change inside of him. Do not let him influence you to change your good morals though.|`|kWjy7uzAaa	If your a girl who likes bad boys , then don't consider yourself a good girl your just a closet slut "bad girl". Good girls are good people so they like good boys, and don't fall for that bad boy crap.|`|Lk0noY62aa	Yes.<br>  <br>  I have both of my ears pierced. I'm wanting the Angels & Demons sleeve tattoo. I play the drums and the guitar(I love soloing). I LOVE hard rock music(Disturbed)! And I just met the most nicest girl EVER! So yeah, we like good girls and some good girls like us.<br>  <br>  Forgot to add that I don't smoke or drink either.<br>  <br>  KJ288- That's not true! I may like "bad" things but I'm not satanic or gothic in ANY WAY! And no, not all girls who like bad guys are sluts.
xyrSl2nSaa	yes it is perfectly fine. I am also catholic and even though i went through the sacrament i haven't went to confession since i was very young. I still receive the Eucarist. There is nothing wrong with it|`|UrNMuhFKaa	I Timothy 2: 5<br>  For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus (not a priest)<br>  Jesus did away with the confessing to a priest - that is an old testemant tradition that was carried forward into the Catholic Church.<br>  I sugggest you begin to study the new testament.|`|pTkjGfBRaa	Yes, you are ok, though it sounds like you may presently have a scrupulous conscience.<br>  <br>  From the Catholic Encyclopedia concerning a scrupulous conscience:<br>  "An unfounded apprehension and consequently unwarranted fear that something is a sin which, as a matter of fact, is not. It is not considered here so much as an isolated act, but rather as an habitual state of mind known to directors of souls as a "scrupulous conscience." St. Alphonsus describes it as a condition in which one influenced by trifling reasons, and without any solid foundation, is often afraid that sin lies where it really does not."<br>  <br>  God wants nothing from you, but everything for you.  Confession and reconciliation prior to the Eucharist is meant to help you become who God created you to be.  God did not create you to live in fear of going to hell.  God loves you and wants the best for you and for your relationships with others.<br>  <br>  A scrupulous conscience can get in the way of your relationship with God.  When the focus is on us, and not on God, we lose sight of God's grace and love.|`|SkgJYDaCaa	Do you really think that God will send you to hell for this? He isn't a God of wrath, He is a God of mercy and grace. Do you think all of the other Christian religions who don't confess to priest before communion are going to hell? I hope not. <br>  <br>  Do you love God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength? That is what He commands that we love Him with everything that we are. We are going to fall short sometimes but that is the whole point of communion (the blood of Jesus) He washes away our sins and is quick to forgive. Do you know that you can confess your sins directly to God because of Jesus? Maybe you should spend some time reading about the teachings of Jesus. John is a great place to start. A priest is a great person to talk to to gain spiritual wisdom from but they are not who save your soul, Jesus is.|`|3WfAOPD9aa	You're fine. "The Eucarist" is unscriptural anyway.<br>  <br>  P.S. Hellfire is also unscriptural.....as in, not supported by the Bible.|`|512dd30dd4fa35da6b4c826537a039ccaa	You need to change your religion and learn to actually obey the commandments of God and not the commandments of men.|`|aeLyiRczaa	I am not a Catholic, therefore you may find offense in this answer.  Now, no man has the ability to stand between you and God or to intercede with God on your behalf.  No man has the ability to forgive you of a sin other then a sin you commit against him.  Jesus is the one being that has the role of interceding with God for us.  The only reason to confess a sin to a person is to ask forgiveness of what you have done to them or to get it off your chest.  Those are the two reasons to confess to a person.  But that person cannot forgive you of anything on behalf of God.  Frankly, anyone who claims to have the role of being able to forgive you on behalf of God or who claims to be in direct line with God, is a liar and a tool of satan.<br>  <br>  Now, according to the Bible, even if something is not a sin and you feel that by doing it, you commit a sin, then you have committed a sin.  Basically, if it feels like a sin to you and you do it anyway, you did wrongly.

You have to have a good idea of what YOU want before you hire one.  And going through the interview process, after telling them your situation, decide if their responses coincide with what you want.  Are they going to fight for you or just do what they want (or what will be easy)?  Do they make you feel confident and like they have your best interest in heart?|`|AA11285960	most people don't 'interview' their attorney...would you interview a dentist or a doctor? probably not. usually you pick a law firm based on word of mouth from friends or family.|`|ZtfN4J6taa	Just one, I asked what to expect, how long it would take, how much he charged per hour, and I hired him.

ZRgLHW3maa	actually, my guy is like that too. Jan 12 made 2 years we have been together. its crazy though because you really don't see that much. it is a great thing too.

Intimacy is not mandatory.|`|cp2182xNaa	It all depends on why you're crying. If you cared about the guy and were really sad, that's completely normal. But if you're like me, you waste so many tears for no reason. I've been with my boyfriend for over 2 years with no major problems, but I'm ridiculously emotional and cry so easily. Sometimes I've cried because I'm just so happy to be with him. Tears of joy aren't wasted to me, but almost all the other times were stupid reasons. But crying makes you feel better when it's done, so it's never really a terrible thing.|`|KQjBLyU3aa	I think most tears wasted on guys are useless, except if the guy really was someone special because a lot of the time we don't really even know whether he was worth it or not..|`|xRIQF7buaa	No, not entirely :)<br>  <br>  We need to let those emotions out, that's healthy.<br>  They aren't really worth the tears, but when a girl's gotta cry, a girl's gotta cry.

pYa8ft5Oaa	Hi Jill-<br>  My name is Brian and I'll do my best to relate to you what I've been through since I just lost my only (older than me) brother to cancer, and I hope it can help you.<br>  <br>  You didn't say who or how close you were to your family members so I'll guess that you saw them often.   <br>  <br>  My brother was ALWAYS there my whole life so yes, at first there was the acceptance of knowing and believing he was gone, and that in itself will take time.  How long depends on you and your relationships with them. Once you have that acceptance, you may grieve and feel sad for a while.<br>  <br>  (Out of the blue without thinking, I still have a "reflex action" to call my brother about whatever I'm thinking of, so if that happens to you don't worry about it, you're normal.)<br>  <br>  Also in accepting the circumstances is (I in no way mean this to be insensitive) the fact that we do die, and I think that the grief is in a large part that we do not want them to be gone in such a way. I don't want to repeat this too many times, but for me it was accepting the fact that he was gone, this is a part of life and he would expect me to move on with mine.<br>  <br>  I still think about him often enough and when I do, and this is very common for people also, I think about the better times and how we laughed and joked around.  I do not think my brother would want me to grieve for too long.<br>  <br>  So all in all what I'm saying is, remember them well, and think of what they would want you to feel, which I'm sure is they wouldn't want you to grieve for long.<br>  <br>  Okay?  You'll be fine in just a little bit of time kiddo. Remember to think of the good times and where ever they are, they want to smile down at us because they want us to be okay too;)<br>  <br>  E-mail me at baverley09 if you want to talk. Just hold on and that little bit of time will really help:)|`|AA10574593	believe that they are in a much better and safer place living happily and peacefully. I am very sorry for your hurt, Pray and try to understand that no matter what one dose there will be no coming back we just have to deal with the situation and we to will have our day. Accept and move I know my words might be hard but it's the life we live in some go and new come. God be with you|`|n3pSWkg0aa	aww, im sorry for your losses,<br>  you could try by getting something that makes you feel close to them and put it somewhere in your room, you could write letters to them to help express what you feel. You could talk to your family, or a close friend, a councilor or a adult you trust.  If you are religious you can try praying, that made me feel better when my grandpas died.  or sometimes what you really need is a good cry to let it all out.<br>  if you want or need to talk about it than you can email me if u want, getting over someones deaths is hard. :(
ge5x9NHxaa	Well I will you should accept.  But this time around try to make him see reasons with you why he should straighten up.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	First off that shows you that your to young to be having sex. Your relationship has been based on sex and so that's all he needs from you and you gave it to him. He is not mature enough to even realize this and so are you. Sex is something that requires a lot of maturity. It's hard on adults who have age and wisdom and maturity so think when you don't have those things how hard it can be. Don't tell me that you love him because the truth is what you like is the sex. How can you love someone you don't even talk to. Please! Think about this and be very honest as honest as you can possibly be. You know I'm right. Don't put yourself through all this drama, you don't need it.|`|wbvkvulNaa	he must be embarrassed about the situation or he confused just like u

Then, during the ceremony, tell her you like her.<br>  <br>  Perfect|`|l2iClWRUaa	usually they can tell if you like them or not and will throw you some sort of hint, like she wants to make time to hang out with you, if not kinda sounds like shes avoiding you.  So assuming she is avoiding the situation then you should either tell her and get it over with instead of being awkward around her or go with ignoring her (not calling) for awhile and see if she makes any sort of attempt to hang out with you, if she likes you she will call you|`|xZm2B3Rtaa	All you can do is wait. If she wanted to hang out with you she would.|`|4EgUP271aa	ask her out she says yes then u like her she likes u. if she says no be nice to her then ask again says no wait a month or two ask again says no give it up|`|x8EG98TMaa	She likes you just ask her out and see how it goes.

JtEBaOdjaa	are they registered anywhere you can stop at on the way?  Otherwise I'd go with cash. Ignore Chris, cash is ALWAYS welcome by a bride and groom.  And with gift cards, unless you KNOW where they like to shop, I probably wouldn't. As much as I'd appreciate the thought, I'd hate to get a gift card from home depot because I wouldn't use it.  I'd appreciate it, but be a little sad that someone just wasted their hard earned money on a gift that is unusable.<br>  Cash is safest unless you have a registry to check.<br>  <br>  edit: just so you know, ettiquette dictates you have up to a year after the wedding to send a gift.  If you want to wait a week or even a few days to get something more thoughtful then go for it.  They probably won't even notice it's missing until you give it to them. (They'll have so many gifts they'll be sifting through for a week or so)|`|WW59n5Lqaa	gift card is a simple but thoughtful gift and it depends how much money u put in it i thik $50-$100 is enough!!*-*|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	25. is a good amount to give them in a nice money card they have a wishing well or somethign to have it placed in. no its not tacky alot of people do this.take care.|`|5c40baa93c7ba8164e45f151f1878025aa	As for gift cards I would say Bed Bath and Beyond or their favorite restaurant.  Do you know where they are registered? Get a card from that store.|`|a88b0f44a1d7abe4bce01e6a248dbc64aa	give them digital camera|`|AA10101711	I just got married last June :) A gift card is always great and can be used by anyone and everyone. If you don't know where they are registered, then you can get Bed Bath and Beyond or Target or something like that. You can also never have too many picture frames or smaller photo albums...weddings come with lots of photos! <br>  <br>  You could put a little package together that consists of a small cute photo album (you can get a cheap one from Kohls or Ross or Target...something like that) and a pretty picture frame that has something to do with weddings....then a $30 gift card in a card. You can get them a beautiful gift from Christian stores (if they are religious) like Lifeway ~ they have great wedding gifts. <br>  <br>  If you are not too close, then go with something thoughtful but not personal (like I mentioned above) because you never know if somewhere down the line you will get closer...believe me, they WILL remember if you got them a bad gift unfortunately, but they may not remember otherwise. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|g9SWvPFtaa	I suggest you don't get gift cards because the last thing they will want to be doing when trying to settle in is getting the time to drive out then spending 1 hour to pick something they want. Money isn't the best either because it looks as though it's an easy way out even if you give $150 a nice present that they don't have is worth more than that. Generally people go for Appliances for weddings, if they don't have something then you can stick to this trend or if you want to be clever get something for him, and something for her.|`|IdXKAU84aa	If you are going to go with a gift card I would suggest Macy's or Bed Bath & Beyond.  <br>  <br>  If not, go and buy some silk sheets for them or a His and Hers set, such as a robe set, towel set, etc....<br>  <br>  Or you can buy something for the honeymoon, or their new home.  If you don't go by the Gift Registry I would highly suggest adding a receipt so that if they have duplicates they can exchange the gift.|`|aipChC3haa	Sweetie, just forget it!<br>  Not everyone needs that kind of a present, and you will have bags under your eyes!<br>  Just enjoy your wedding and reception.<br>  Guests don't expect presents, they are nice, but honestly hon you will survive w/o them!|`|1a1fc7850a41950081401eac4b686d4aaa	Money is a fine gift.  Give them $40 - 2 $20 bills inside a card is great.|`|Zzq80w6Jaa	Cow balls.|`|JZtY6Ymmaa	soap<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Next question please!|`|KsJs1YP5aa	i would get a gift card to like home depot or something|`|DRGS1TQJaa	well ****, if its tomorrow just get em money. $150 should do it|`|XNiMqekBaa	Think of where they are getting married or going on their honeymoon, and make it personal.. If they are going to a tropical place you can get a big basket and ad flip flops, beach towels, sun screen, etc. We got something like this for our wedding and we loved it.. Not your normal toaster, silverware, or dishes so it stood out and we still remember who got it for us.<br>  <br>  Or you could always buy something from their registry.. If they registered somewhere...|`|bEJHO123aa	look at their registry, duh!|`|PmjilshSaa	a red toaster.
jTV6rLX3aa	Go to coffee shops, study in libraries, study in book stores, study in coffee shops, flirt, make friends with your classmates (they may have siblings/cousins), join study groups, attend lectures at local universities, go to museums, read at the park. <br>  <br>  When you do talk to guys, seem happy/fun and interested in what they do/say.|`|NcH1FetGaa	i prefer girls who can be themselves and nothing more to me.

Catch up with some guys from your old school and maybe bring along a few friends.<br>  <br>  Guys tend just to fall for girls for who they are, girls fall for guys coz they make them feel special. Maybe just bring up some topics involving that, coz guys are interested by that and it makes it known that you know what sex is...|`|9rZMtLVBaa	I find it easier to talk to guys when I can find common ground with them. I've always been someone that can come up with clever jokes to tell. So try to get a guy to laugh and they will love it. And will definitely be more excited to get to know you better :-)|`|078UfDg6aa	well..you should start by not being such a *****:). Your anwser to my question figured you out right away. You will be alone all your life sinse your so concieded.|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	go to the mall and meet boys in your cutest outfits girly!|`|M7r7gHNGaa	You are extremely young to be looking to get into a relationship. Try getting involved in other extracurricular activities after school. That will give you something to keep you occupied in a constructive way (as opposed to hanging out at the mall). This is also a good way to meet boys but don't go searching for a relationship yet.
GsRpZJX5aa	dont just say this zack guy is ruining your relationship.....ur gf is too.<br>  this is weird cuz it is usually the other way around. but man i feel for you. you sound like you reallly love her. but from the sound of it. this just isnt right.  she clearly isnt ready for a relationship.  plus she kissed someone!!!!!!  she sound immature. if she really cared which she prob does somewhat<br>   she would stop tlking to this guy. my bf and i hav been  together for 2 years. i tlk to other guys as friends and he knows that. i dnt flirt some of them with me<br>  and i kno it makes him uncomfortable. so i cut off connection at least by text. if it really makes you uncomfortable she would stop and not wnt to jepordize ur relationship. and its a way no no if she started tlking to the guy again!! you sound really sweet but im sorry to say  she isnt a good gf. she is just hurting you more and more <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  oh jus some fyi. one time my bf got really mad cuz there is this guy i text. i dnt like him at all. he jus joined the army when i did. so any ways we were tlking not flirting and my bf took my phone wen i wasnt looking  and on changed his name to the guys name. so when i got a text from my bfs phone it said the other guys name......btw i was kinda mad about this. but i got a text from who i thought it was the guy saying i should ditch my bf and thought i was cute and crap.   i was lik wtf.  i texted bak saying that i thought he was rude cuz he knows i have a bf. and i love him. hahaha anyways it ended up being my bf jus  to see what i would say. this was way back and it was kinda a immature move. but i wonder if you did that to ur gf what she would say????   well thanks i hope i at least helped a little bit<br>  and i wish you the best luck!!|`|T6HTHXbcaa	i'm sorry <br>  you sould tell Zack to stop texting your girlfriend<br>  <br>  i know Zack and your girlfriend both behind your back<br>  <br>  <br>  so i am feeling sorry for your girlfriend (but she need to STOP texting Zack just tell her to stop or you leave her for going to college and never see her again)|`|28d89d73cfa630ce9da9343770880c69aa	there is a saying that usually applies to most of these situations. Once a cheater always a cheater.|`|xZm2B3Rtaa	so you guys havent talked about it right?|`|A9iACNrSaa	Well, this is going to come hard to you, but sometimes, you need the cold hard truth, no sweet-talking accompanied:<br>  <br>  You both are too young to even TALK about marriage. So, that idea shouldn't even be in your mind. If you both did get married, it probably wouldn't last long, and if you had kids, what would they think as they get older?<br>  <br>  Well, that point aside:<br>  <br>  She sounds like she is cheating, but you can never be too sure. You ARE going to college, and she will definitely be craving you. She is looking for something else to fill the void that you will leave as you go to college. <br>  <br>  With the cellphone ordeal, she is very much wrong for saving Zack under a different name. She is trying to deceive you and that is wrong in a relationship. Sure, Rico. You may be hurt. But you need to look at it this way: If it gets too serious at this age, you need to let it go. You might end up meeting somebody else in college that's closer to your age! You could get very serious with them and end up having a relationship behind Elizabeth's back. And then, you get home, break up with her so you can be with the other woman, and it hurts Elizabeth just as much as she is hurting you. Let her go, and face it - You're too young.|`|YuhFNfJmaa	IM so sorry. I guess all you need to do is just talk to her, and tell her how you feel about the situation, she must care about you a lot to tell you what happened. I would be worried to if she sneaking around talking to him :(<br>  <br>  im SO sawee. <br>  <br>  <br>  Just tell her everything on your mind, and since your going off to college, and shes already talking to someone else, imagine whats she going to do when you leave, and i know this is going to hurt but maybe this is your sign that your ready for a break with this girl :(<br>  <br>  <br>  you sound like a great guy, you will find someone that deserves you. <br>  <br>  email me if you want to talk more. <br>  <br>  a.wood11@yahoo.com|`|eRtb2MZFaa	Well. Your doing something wrong. Mentally, physically or emotionally its bothering her. I went thru the same thing, only i was on her side. She loves you but she is scared. Something that you do isnt making her happy and she is trying to find it somewhere else. Im sorry to sound rude but im just being honest. Sorry bud|`|x1HoSdYTaa	Dude, I feel for you. She is cheating. She needs to grow up. If she wnts to make a commitment she cannot do this. My girlfriend did this once. I was mad and sad. I told her she should be having talks like this with her friends that are women, not this dude. I asked her friends whats up, and they said they had barely talked to my gf cuz she has been talking to this other guy! So, I tell her if he is gay I'm cool with it. She tells me he isn't. Then I caught them kissing in the halls. I asked her if she got a sex change and he was gay. She says she is sorry, then turns around and starts talking with the guy again. Then her firends came and told me that she needed time away from me. I told my gf that she is going to hook up with this guy now, she says no. Then her phone rings, it was in my locker, I go and grab it, she wants it, it was the guy, he texted her saying he is glad there going out now.  She dates him for a month then comes back sying she was pregnant and that the other guy isn't willing to help, and he is the father! I got mad when she said tell your parents your the father. I told her no, cuz I wasn't going to be looked down on by my parents and shamed in my church cuz she was a cheater and hoe. Told her to raise the baby herself and get labled a hoe in the school. She moved to Texas after having the baby.<br>  Your girlfriend is too young to know love, break up with her and she'll start dating the other guy. Once she is older, she will no love and you and her will probably hitch together again. Break up with her for now, its for the best.|`|kERP7zAhaa	my ex's name is zach. and i know he dated someone named beth. i know its probably not the same person, but idk i feel sad reading this<br>  <br>  how old is he?|`|i2NqmsBeaa	Awww! I think you deserve someone better, sad to say. But you seem really really sweet.<br>  Ive never heard of keeping eachothers class rings, thats the cutest thing ever.

( =|`|rKsgGHKkaa	awwww omg that sucks.<br>  e-mail me if u wanna talk bout it. i hope u guys can work it out u sound like a really great guy, and id hate to hear thatd u got her bcuz of ur situation.|`|oTVWgTqQaa	I think u should realise ur fault and go to ur g.f  and try to make bond with her and feel sorry to her.|`|JyEoCBrJaa	I think you are too young to be saying that you or her are in love. If you are seriously in love I feel your pain. Yes, you have every right to be mad, sad, upset etc...Why is she not taking your calls, texts or emails? She's the one that messed up with you. This is what you do. You need to let her chase you. Let her know that she's messing out on a good thing. If she doesn't come back to you, then it wasn't meant to be and all you was experiencing was puppy love and not real love. At this point, you need to pick up your heart and move on. I'm almost positive you will find someone else in college.<br>  <br>  **How many guys number that she has in her phone that are not her relatives? This is the question you need to be asking your self.|`|etszzyataa	dude, I went through the same thing as you did almost if you are faithful to her and obviously she wasn't you deserve a lot better way better. Sorry to say but you are better off without her because you know why? your 17, your going to college next year, college is going to be the best 4 years of your life. and a fifteen year old girl is not mature they make stupid decisions. and a lot of times they are selfish. just live your life dont get caught up with someone younger than you. trust me, you dont know me but trust me college is going to be the best for you.
PDqg5OMgaa	Hi dear...<br>  <br>  Your question is rite... sometimes even i too thought like that.<br>  But no end for that question its true..<br>  <br>  And it depends upon the persons.<br>  If you ask me i say love.<br>  Because, as my personal experience because of love and affection from my mom, friends i earned and got lots and lots of things.<br>  <br>  (Love can do everything)<br>  So, i prefer only the LOVE..<br>  <br>  <br>  (think and act positive.... )<br>  :)|`|ZRgLHW3maa	love, money doesn't buy everything and love is way better then money. money is paper and love is a life long emotion. the people who say money has never been in real true love and they are missing out, but it is worth waiting on. I don't have alot of money but I have alot of love and thats the best gift anyone could ever ask for.|`|Ztgxd5Jiaa	money you can always work for and feel in your hands. but love is more it's better then having money. love give you the felling your high to. win win  you will feel like the luckiest person in the world. that a felling we would all love.|`|kGh0Cf5Raa	Love. Love stays forever money gets spent. Money can't buy love and money doesn't make people happy. It will make you happy for a short time but that's it.

l2qnuSKjaa	i believe it means that hes feelin uncomfortable with something. he doesnt know wat he should do and theres something wrong wiith wat hes feelin. hes probably also feelin distant, try to talk to him! ask him wats wrong, and why hes avoiding u or not interacting with u. if anythin he will tell u. and tell him wat ur noticing|`|4p3bo90Eaa	Maybe something is bothering him try to think back and ask yourself did you do anything wrong and try talking to him|`|i3G5kkOYaa	lose some weight|`|kX7PSvBSaa	he needs time to think|`|L1jrlQSMaa	he is trying to say can you go out with me,  maybe ask him|`|DRGS1TQJaa	this means you should confront him about the situations, not in a direct way, like "what the hell is wrong with you" but more like "i think you've been acting different, is there something you would like to tell me?"<br>  <br>  If he is your boyfriend and ignoring you then thats definitely something worth confronting him about. but if he continues after the talk then he sounds like not such a good guy to be dating
7g8UHUJgaa	i am eighteen too (besides the point) but it is kind of hard to tell if he likes you.<br>  <br>  guys tend to stare at girls. at a dance my guy friend kept staring at me and im like "why???" i thinking he needs to pay more attension to his date. LOL<br>  <br>  ummm, if you havenot told anyone how you feel about him, i do not think he will ever know. <br>  <br>  thanks to my guy friend's friend, i found out my guy friend is verrry much into me. <br>  <br>  but maybe your guy friend is not looking for a girlfriend. maybe he just needs a friend. being good friends with him first will make the "possible" relationship come closer.<br>  <br>  <br>  that's all i can tell you.<br>  <br>  <br>  again guys tend to stare, but he might like you.
DYnvacFVaa	I think you have to becareful because feelings can come up and you might not mean for anything to happen but alot of the time they do.<br>  <br>  When you have a fight with your girl friend and you go talk about this with your friend then your opening yourself up for having an unhealthy relationship with this other person,<br>  <br>  I think it just depends, some people you just have no attraction to what so ever and can easily be friends with, but if there is an possibility of attraction i think you should stay away.|`|QHASqNDtaa	It's bad if you flirt with them. But talking? No...that's fine.|`|RSm8aXgzaa	Umm seeing as how the female species makes up approximately 50% of the population, I don't see how it is really possible to avoid talking to girls altogether besides your girlfriend.  If you mean flirting, I think it's kind of okay if you want to lead them on or something but not actually get into anything with them.  If you mean talking on the phone.... that's a little weird if you hang on the phone with other girls for long periods of time.  But if you have a lot of friends that are girls, it's understandable to chat for a couple minutes.|`|ZkeoRyy3aa	There is nothing wrong with talking to other females as long as your not being to flirtatious or trying something with them.  <br>  Young girls usually don't understand that a man can just talk to a women and not try jumping her.|`|evJ2GEodaa	Depends...
F2rI3Juaaa	My man & I play Hangman!|`|3HQPgGOGaa	me too.... soooo we sometimes plays games... me and him can play for hours without me getting bored.. ( maybe becuz i win mostly )!... ^.^ lol i dont know about him o.o|`|Bp8ls3XMaa	monopoly.
ifTMSSjdaa	i would give them attention such as gradual eye contact and then walk with them to class and flirt with them : )|`|WrctoEyMaa	Go out of your way to talk to them. Then flirt a little but do it in a fun, light way. Make a few comments like telling them you absolutely love talking to them, or you wish you could be with them all the time. Then if they still don't get it just tell them- because after doing all the other things you should be able to talk to him pretty easy. Good Luck!
CkAU0Tcpaa	forget the leader,just speak to who speaks to you the most
vR7Bew2Xaa	You can't force yourself to like someone that your not attracted to!<br>  And just tell him that you don't like him like that, and want to still just be best friends.|`|wbvkvulNaa	give him a chance and if things don't work out with u guys then break up with him|`|231e2f619695988a9a2770ac10966cd2aa	kiss him. kissing the girl/guy that you like(or dont like) will tell you the truth. if you feel something when you kiss him, there is a chance it will work out. if ou dont like kissing him and think its weird and uncomfortable, then find i new guy. but keep him as a friend. he seems charming.|`|SkgJYDaCaa	Well he treats you well and is super nice but you don't have feelings back for him? That's a difficult one because you don't want to hurt him but at the same time you don't want to settle for someone you're not head over heals with. If you were to date him now and you don't feel any chemistry or anything it wouldn't be fair to either of you. You may end up losing a close friend. I would let him down in a nice way, explaining that you see him as a very close friend and you don't want to risk losing your friendship because that's too important for you.  Good luck =)
ZkeoRyy3aa	If I were you, I would discuss it with your parents...maybe they can talk to her, or put her on birth control if they are that sort of parent...if not, maybe they'll keep them apart. It may seem mean, but it's in your sisters best interest.|`|YLajQcFkaa	GOOD for her.  Don't worry you will find the right guy soon..|`|hsyI1DxDaa	'he is bad boy type.'<br>  <br>  My alarm bells instantly rang off. You REALLY should talk to her fast before she gets herself into deep crap, he sounds like an **** from what you described. That, and if she does end up getting pregnant, I'd assume he'd probably run the hell away. :p How old is the boyfriend? 14 is really young to even think about sex, but I doubt that'll stop them.<br>  <br>  Just talk to her about him. Oh, and try talking to your parents about him, it might help.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	best thing to do is approach this as a girl friend. talk to her like a friend. "hey i see yall are getting serious... have yall talked about sex?" open up the conversation in a non threatening way so she will trust having this conversation with you. once she does talk about safe sex. and then maybe talk about mistakes ppl you know have made. like "i have a friend that trusted a guy and he wanted to do it without protection and turned out he had an std." let her know the consequences and that if a guy persists then he isn't thinking of your needs and is a selfish pig. <br>  <br>  just remember no matter what you say shes going to do whatever she wants so you got to make sure shes just well informed... provide the protection yourself. do whatever it takes to get her in that safe mindset.|`|pqlhPnexaa	I would sit down with your sister and have a little chit chat with her. Don't tell her you hate her bf- that'll just put her on the defensive- but make sure she knows the consequences of having sex and what it could mean if a condom breaks or whatever.<br>  <br>  Just don't get mad at her: if runs away from you, her family, you know where she's running... right into his arms. So be gentle with her, but show her that sex is NOT a good idea right now. At all. Fourteen is WAYYYYY young.<br>  <br>  Tell your parents if you really have to.|`|IfOTZhQyaa	Where are your parents. This is the job of the parents and not yours. She is way to young to be having sex. How in the world can she be making out in the house,aren't your parents home and if not why is he there when they are not. Talk to your mom or dad about this and let them deal with it.|`|pVaZty4Maa	you should sit her down and talk to her tell her how you feel and then you should take her out to meet other guys her age..... you never know, she might find another bf :)|`|2FOKZbcfaa	just make it extremely awkward for her. confront her about it and tell her not to.|`|TBf8WFfeaa	talk to your sister if that doesn't help talk to the parents hers and his if need be
mIyUCey4aa	It depends. What means more to you coming from him? Spending quality time with you and creating memories or material things?

I usually fall for girls who seem to know exactly how to get the guy they want. They don't act needy. They talk to plenty of other guys, so I know they have a lot of options. They are very confident and usually pretty intelligent. They also take care of themselves physically and stay in good shape. So there really isn't a specific personality, as long as you aren't needy, jealous, or obsessive, then you are just fine.|`|bYvGNvrvaa	I know you say men only but i'm lesbian so i have a mans mind.

AA10065812	*** What is it you want to do.  Do you want custody if she gets a divorce?  Or do you what her to take the child?  The first to file, while in possession of the child, usually ends up with custody.|`|Kh5o3QCcaa	Sounds like she may need a change of pace, and is offering an open relationship instead of divorce.  How would you feel about that?  Perhaps bring it up with her to discuss the details and to of course to see if that is truly what she is suggesting.<br>  <br>  If you are alright with that I think it would be a lovely solution if you two still care for each other and simply need something new and exciting or have just downgraded from lovers to more like friends.  It's better than divorce, cheaper, and it would keep your family together.<br>  <br>  You never know too, it could put that special spark back into your marriage... sort of help each of you see what you fell in love with in each other in the first place.  If her first suggestion was divorce though I wouldn't agree to an open relationship with your hopes set on that.  Keep them simple so that you don't get discouraged if your relationship with each remains weak.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and your wife.|`|IvMPh09baa	leave her first, beat her to it.|`|Eug52iQDaa	If you want a real marriage, let her go, sweetie.  She doesn't seem up for a marriage.  That said, you sound like good friends.  Keep it that way since you have a daughter.  No recriminations, no fighting.  You're just people that have different goals.  Try hard to keep that friendship.  Divorces don't always have to end up angry and nasty.<br>  <br>  You can love someone and not be the one to live with them for the rest of your life (marriage).<br>  <br>  Good luck to you both.|`|iD4ejChZaa	talk to a pastor, if she insist on seeing women, you don't want her, <br>  get your life straightened out, don't just go from girl to girl.|`|gLqX7TG0aa	guess she wants you to go out and find her some women to bring home to her.......find a straight woman......|`|rcXmEYoTaa	Are you sure she is OK with it? <br>  Whether she's bi or not she is still a girl with feelings<br>  When girls say we're OK with it at most times we're not but we just don't want to cause fights<br>  If you can't feel this animosity then maybe you haven't been hanging around her enough for you to be a proper husband.<br>  Maybe you should stay home more often and figure out what she really wants before going out with other girls.|`|5c7rgxA3aa	Dude...I have seen this before.<br>  <br>  The reason she's telling you it's OK if you go out with other girls is that she's interested in or has started seeing someone already. It's their way to tell you that they don't care anymore...and when you do go our with other girls, she won't feel bad for herself in either seeing someone or already jumped into bed with someone. <br>  <br>  With the yes-no divorce...she's torn because she knows she's doing wrong and doesn't want to tell you. She's conflicted inside about what to do, how to tell you...if at all, etc. <br>  <br>  Start getting your personal effects in order. Start putting your money aside cause you're going to need it later. She's getting ready to drop the bomb on you and not sure how to do it.<br>  <br>  The last 5 times my coworkers have come to me with this exactly same scenario...I've called it every time. Their spouse is already seeing someone.<br>  <br>  Best of luck.|`|b8c678e20c5b368190238ab98c78d204aa	Let her go if she loves you she will come back to you it's hard i know i had to let my husband go but he did come back. Did you know she was bi when you married her if so why in the world would you take on someone who could leave you for both sexes.|`|512dd30dd4fa35da6b4c826537a039ccaa	Tell her that the man is head of the house and she made a commitment to you.  Also, if you need two wives, then that is understandable.|`|HE56Jra6aa	Do exactly what she wants... She is. Find someone who will treat you like the man you are not the toy she had.|`|B5WbBKDOaa	open the door and give her the boot|`|AMkMHOAyaa	START READING YOUR BIBLE AN GOD WILL KEEP HER BUT YOU HAVE TO BE DEDICATED|`|7aoHmM4baa	there is a lots of single ladies out there worried to get married so don t worry|`|aeLyiRczaa	Your wife is an immoral loon and nut case.  Get her gone and keep the kid, for the kids sake.  And by no means do you go and see other women.  She wants you to do so in order to not feel guilty for her actions, to be able to say you did wrongly and broke you two up, thereby avoiding responsibility on her part and also because she wants to be able to say you cheated on her.  By the way, if you knew she was bi when you married her, maybe the kid would be better off without you as well.|`|Id4aSqrPaa	she maybe getting bored. start a conversation about what yall can do in the bedroom. fantasies, role playing, etc. she probably loves you and wants you to be happy too. you just need to be open and honest about what you want and what you are willing to do for each other.|`|i4gFurmqaa	It might be part of a fantasy for her, for you to cheat. Or maybe she wants you to bring another woman home. Or maybe she's just unhappy. Tactfully suggest  ways to be more creative in teh bedroom.

I promise treat her right in the bedroom.  I bet she bored..<br>  <br>  Good luck,|`|4iUhdKKiaa	take her at her word.  When she finds that men are generally no good she will come running back to the one she had.  Bi means shes just messing around with girls that doesnt mean they can hold her interest so dont worry about that.
BbT3DCHvaa	God only gives you what you can handle...|`|3TdT5mG2aa	It has nothing to do with God, but it's life. **** happens.<br>  <br>  I lost my best friend, who at the time was 16, a few years ago. He was a good person on the inside. Not a day goes by when I don't think about him. I feel your pain and I know what it's like. At least you got to tell him that you loved him. I was too afraid to take that risk while he was alive. I said it one time. I loved him too much. We were friends for about 4 years when he died. At the time he died, I was only 13. Life has to go on, though. He would have wanted me to celebrate his life and instead of being sad and crying, he wanted me to be happy. I'm sure your friend/ boyfriend or whatever he was to you thinks the same way. Good luck!|`|i835yPPGaa	Maybe cause god doesn't exist?|`|1zfwLsQpaa	I Never met him/knew him but I feel your loss. i'm so sorry. Be strong he wouldn't want you to be sad, move on. god knows why he does stuff|`|PkC1Sk8Qaa	Stop dwelling on it, harsh but true. You have to get your mind away from why it happened and who did it. Whether you believe in god or not is irrelevant. What is important is you accept he is gone over time, get used to the idea and eventually get over it. Understand there will be other people you will meet in your life. If you feel like you can't handle it then get professional help before it gets out of control.|`|bJnNhtXxaa	wow, tat was really deep<br>  <br>  I'm really sorry hun, having a person like Ben leave ur world is the most hardest thing i culd possibly think of.<br>  <br>  as for ur question, i don't really know. i believe that god takes away and creates for a purpose,a  reason. Maybe God sent Ben to Earth so he could touch the hearts of many people, including you. Maybe God sent Ben becuz he wanted people to feel and learn wat love is. Wat i believe is that ben was sent for a reason, to teach the bunch of u. but no one really knows why God does that. im truly srry for ur loss<br>  <br>  ~best of luck|`|kX7PSvBSaa	omg if this is real i feel bad for you<br>  here is a video 4 you to watch|`|MQIc7X0Zaa	well dont get down with yourself, and dont blame god for this.

I'm going through similar, having lost THE best sister-in-law recently. She was like my own sister.<br>  <br>  I'm close to you, in northern NSW and my thoughts go out to you. God really has nothing to do with it. There is no god, so it;s nothing that your guy did to upset anyone. It's life. Accidents happen, sickness happens. When it's someone we love it brings it on home and we realise how short life is and all the things that can happen on our journey.<br>  <br>  Ben will live on, as you say, in your heart and your mind, and this is all we can hope for when we die that someone will always remember us.<br>  <br>  If I was closer I would give you a hug and cry with you. Be brave, remember Ben as he was, all the good times, all the fun, the laughs, the influence he had on others. stay strong!

GPakfvINaa	Let me assure you that there is nothing wrong with being a goody two shoes - just remember that it is never a bad thing to keep some things a mystery!  don't send that guy naked pictures, no matter what you do!  you never know where they could end up.<br>  <br>  take your transition into the new me SLOWLY - that way you are less likely to make any decisions you can regret.  Let me tell you, for example, that I was a BIG goody two shoes, and now that I'm 25, I was able to get an amazing job that requires a high clearance level because I was a goody two shoes - I was able to demonstrate that I had never done drugs, never broken the law, etc.  I was SO GRATEFUL that I had been a "good girl!"<br>  <br>  Just think - you are likely to look back and say "Wow, I wish I hadn't done all those bad things" but it's not likely that you will look back and say "wow, I wish I had drank more and acted stupid more and had sex with more people."  You MAY, however, look back and wish that you had had more fun, so don't be afraid to go out, have fun, and still be a good kid!|`|ifTMSSjdaa	don't give in to the peer pressure i know it is tough but you gotta be strong. just cause you are the outcast of your group for not doing that crap doesn't mean you are lame.|`|evJ2GEodaa	Stay who you are, you'll regret this change later in life.

You aren't waisting your teenage life btw|`|gLeN67HTaa	maybe since your friends have been going to parties, drinking, etc. you feel like you should also. and a goody two shoes doesnt mean you have to have sex or something to prove your not a goody two shoes. also you said that a guy you like was texting you and asked you to send pics of yourself....and you said you were nervous. if you were nervous, then i dont think you want to do all this stuff. just the idea sounds interesting and you maybe think you have to grow up. just be yourself. you shouldnt do stuff just because you feel pressured. and if you arent pressured, make the choice you think is right. <br>  <br>  answer mine please? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ai6b.8br2uG.O48jGK98h0Dsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090215161910AAl9c4W">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ycjfzm9Naa	There's no problem with being a little naughty, but don't go against your morals (you might really regret it), you have to be careful of STD's, and do NOT send nude pics.

XmJZkFuMaa	You can't refuse to move.  They're the parents, they call the shots.<br>  <br>  So, my sister and I were moved right before we were going into HS.  Two completely different approaches.  I came out here looking forward to a new beginning.  Back home, everyone knew every little thing about me.  They knew me, my family, and I knew every bit about them.  Finally I got the chance to be the new kid, the enigma, the "who knows what she's about" and I LOVED it.  I stepped out of my box, made friends, and basically approached it as an opportunity to not have everyone judge me based on what they already knew.  (This might have something to do with the fact that as the youngest I was always judged by my siblings, this was a chance for me to be unconnected to them.)<br>  <br>  My sister?  She threw fits, went into a funk, got depressed, hung out with the wrong crowd, found drugs/alcohol, and basically began wrecking her life.  Years later, she claims she always wanted to move and doesn't remember what a little drama snot she was.  <br>  <br>  So you can basically approach this as a chance to make a new mold, new friends, new slate, and keep in touch with old friends but expand your horizons, your life, new experiences before you become an adult... or as them ripping you away from your friends and get in a funk that only bad things come out of.  Either way, you'd still have to move.  <br>  <br>  That's my advice, take it or leave it, I'm not meaning to offend if I have, just if you look at this as a great thing, even though you'll miss what you're leaving behind, it will turn out much better.  Settling in and difficulties have much more to do with your mindset than anything else.  I've always found that people flock to the new face, and test them out, and then you have a chance to settle in.|`|Ann7Jyhoaa	Nope, you will have to move at some point in your life, think about it as maturing, you're leaving your childhood to become a mature young woman =)<br>  <br>  Trust me, moving house is fun as
IJ2QhfKEaa	she obviously isnt a true friend. i think she does like him or she doesnt have any1 she likes and doesnt want you to get a bf and her b single. call the guy or approach him alone and ask him does he want to hang out some time just you two. you will find out pretty quick by his response if anything is ever gonna happen between you.|`|Likst1Mxaa	SHE IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.She treats you like dirt and is embarrassed to be seen with you. That is not a real friend.<br>  <br>  Ignore her, don't speak to her, delete her numbers, email, myspace accounts etc. Make friends with a new group of girls. <br>  It doesn't take backbone to ignore someone.<br>  <br>  If you have a crush in the guy, GO AFTER HIM.|`|f2f5de2feea0da330e1b307cdce13ba0aa	shes is not a true friends.<br>  she sounds like a beeeetchh, im sure you dont need her :)
eRtb2MZFaa	depends on how long they have been dating. 13 year olds shouldnt be making out anyways but w/e. where are her parents?|`|ZRgLHW3maa	well considering she is only 13, it makes her look really bad. but I am not judging her either. doing it too much in public will make her appear "slutty". but there is nothing wrong with kissing with tongue|`|yARKV3PXaa	No its for people really in love its a major turn on for most girls when guys know how to kiss with tongue.|`|NUOGcCBYaa	making out at 13, for everyone to see. Not always a good thing to do in public. Well at any age really, not something a lot of people care to see (2 people making out). Older people really don't enjoy seeing younger people (mainly younger girls) kissing. So yeah it make her look a little bad, even slutty to some...........<br>  <br>  But kissing ( french kissing) can be great with the right person, some guys kiss better than others. And if you get a great kisser "Hmmmmm" kissing a good kisser, can be mighty fine......lol<br>  <br>  There's kissing and then there is kissing, as time goes on and she/you ger older. Kissing can be very passionate and very more mean full, then when your younger.<br>  <br>  Had my first (slutty) kiss at 13.........................lol|`|9rZMtLVBaa	Trust me its not "slutty". There is nothing wrong with a little tongue ;-)|`|CHF7VtElaa	she's only 13 and should probably keep her tongue in her mouth.|`|LUPbTt1saa	WHAT REALYY DO YOU THINK ABOUT THIS.....
8ce582f766c97dd7eed13e1fed415a2baa	My dear friend, the people here trying to answer your complicated question regarding the relationship conflict you are currently experiencing with a situation which i call " good friend-to-girl friend conflict", is seems to be very easily answerable. But its NOT. <br>  <br>  See.. women are so impatient when the question is what they want.. and they are surprisingly ignorant when the question is what offers and how many offers they have... <br>  <br>  Lets talk first one first: WHAT THEY WANT? <br>  <br>  They want nothing.. they just want to run behind a man who give them the challenge to get him. Usually women get fascinated with a man about thinking that how would they look like with him.. as a couple... as a thumb rule, the more you present yourself as a challenge, the more they'll follow you and try to talk to impress you.<br>  <br>  Second, What and How many offers they have?<br>  <br>  If you, so far in your life, thought that women want to choose the only one man whom they like without comparison with the all other available guys out there. Then YOU ARE WRONG. Women like to compare every single offer then got. if a girl talk to you and suddenly you realize that how come she like me? then think again. Because that girl may fell short of offers and unluckily for her and luckily for you: you are the only option. This happens to many people.<br>  <br>  Sometimes women fantasize too much about the ideal partner, then they think that way only and try to match the personality with that fake ideological image. <br>  <br>  YOUR CASE: There are some good answers already given to you, but still they are not perfectly applicable to your case. I suggest you to use the first fundamental i told you above, then talk to her about a new girl(could be fake one) and yes dont stop talking till then. Try to make her jealous like hell. She must be burning like cooked and fried food, and try to tell her she isnt very good at all. or something like " she is onyl a good friend material" Thats it.<br>  <br>  There she'll try her best  to get you back. But listen.. if you really love her.. n you dont want to hurt her feelins etc... then think of this as a test for your love... But dude.. once u realize that you love her so deeply and can do anything for her... then never leave her, always comfort her... never lie to her.. and be the father.<br>  <br>  See where is that road going? Haha<br>  <br>  Cheers|`|uIUSXP9kaa	Go 2her house with a flower, talk to her about this in personal. And think about the decision she took & if she say dnt think about you in the same way then go around with another girl 2 make her jealous but for god sake dnt stop talking 2 her.|`|wV1uSbE8aa	wait for her call.<br>  girls dont like desprate boys.|`|Wg0VteZ9aa	ugh  is it that hard to use proper english???|`|oTVWgTqQaa	I think u should tell her everything that u love her may be her heart melt for u i am not sure may be she understand u.|`|XQWInrsBaa	Go and express ur feelings. You r now going on 2 sides. If she clarifies u all the things atleast u would be at 1 side. I think u are getting possessive about her. Dont be. If she refuses your proposal, so what u both can still b friends. Right? So make a big heart, call her and express ur feelings. And next time pleaseeeeeeeee write properly. Best of luck|`|JCWbgCU2aa	if u r not telling ur feelings then how one can know the how much u love him and if u r telling and she is rejecting u, then u can know the position.<br>  so go and tell ur feellings. do not feel what she will think.<br>  from starting u tell.|`|UgKeRdxbaa	Dear<br>  Never take these moments bad for u but its a time to measure ur love or ur relation spent u with her. If u loved her faithfully,she will call u defiantly.If u made a flirt with her,then its ur luck.Every body wants true love instead of true love.|`|JYQ6M5xmaa	just get with someone. because this girl doesn't like you, you're a good friend but lets be honest. she wants something else. so just effff her, and get with a hunnnie ! : )
c720a537294a26363d1792085df262cdaa	well, i hate to say this, but if your high school is anything like the one i went to(which now supplies a day care for students that cannot afford to pay someone to watch their child while they are in class) then you are probably a minority.  don't take it like it's a bad thing though.  keeping your virginity until marriage is a wonderful thing, and some lucky person will love you that much more because you were a virgin when you married.  i took my husbands virginity and it was way more special to me than if he wouldn't have been a virgin....i just wish i would've stayed a virgin like i wanted to in high school.|`|YLajQcFkaa	Well NO not most teens by far these days.  BUT most teen boys lie like a bad rug when the subject of virginity is brought up.  And some girls do to.  SO not as many of them have actually had intercourse.|`|AA12135516	I don't know what the statistics are but i know far too many teens lose there virginity far too early. Be proud of the way you feel & stick to it & never allow others to make you feel like the odd one out because in years to come i bet they will have regrets & looking back wish they had acted like you..Good on you!|`|evJ2GEodaa	Sadly most children these days do not keep their virginity. <br>  I think all of them will regret this later on in life. <br>  You should not feel like the odd one out, you have self respect and that is a great quality to have.|`|4VIjILk1aa	Most teens don't keep their virginity but they should. There's nothing wrong with wanting to stay a virgin in tell your married.|`|wRlsYWklaa	stay true to ur self.... its good to stay pure... they will regret their deicsions later.
ktj5qv4faa	the same thing that's up with your spelling....ie i have no frigging idea...|`|IJ2QhfKEaa	maybe i read that too fast or something but it made no sense|`|K4IaWDZnaa	may be they r trying 2 fool u anyways ,  may be they r thinking smthin.....@$$%^%$$##%%^!!<br>  so just simply go and ask them!<br>  bye!<br>   goood luck!|`|qV7q9sFNaa	ummm..
