Yahoo Messenger stores the archive as .dat files on your harddrive, usually in "C\Program Files\Yahoo!\Messenger\Profiles".<br>  <br>  As was said above, to read any old messages, you normally click on a user's ID to read them, but after visiting several forums I found this handy little freeware tool: <a href="http://www.carbonize.co.uk/Old/Yahoo/archive.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.carbonize.co.uk/Old/Yahoo/arc...</a> which lets you open your messenger .dat files without entering your YIM account. Note: I haven't used it yet myself, but from what I read so far, people seem to like it...|`|WB7sFVxAaa	you have to open up yahoo messenger, go to the top and click on Contacts...then click archives<br>  <br>  yahoo doesn't actually saves the files under your PC, it saves it in the Yahoo Messenger program
1thzSbS8aa	He was totally blowing smoke. How was he deleting the questions---staring at the screen and wishing real hard?<br>  <br>  The only ways to remove a question are either via the Report button, or by an email to the Y/A team (for instance when you want them to investigate a user profile with a pattern of trollery, or point-gaming).|`|tdQTZPI7aa	You are having your leg pulled.   It takes two or more reports before Yahoo looks at a question.  The Yahoo decides it is indeed a violation they delete the question.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, but that is not the case. While a common user MAY get a high enough reputation with YA to remove a question with a single report of abuse, the report must be made first. And nobody can be certain that they are removing it 'by themselves', because they have no way of knowing if they are the first reporter, or the 12th, or how many are reporting virtually simultaneously.<br>  <br>  The only people capable of removing content on this site without using the report abuse buttons are staff members.<br>  <br>  The only other thing he may have been referring to is that sometimes a direct email to the staff regarding severe infractions on the site can cause a removal without actually pushing the report abuse button. But this is still considered 'reporting abuse'.<br>  <br>  <EDIT: As for the common misconception that it takes '2 or more' reports, the abuse page itself states different: "If one or more reliable members of the community report this answer it will be removed from Answers. " So, conceivably, one report can do it.>
d645e3c1f0da82127be8455d37dddb8faa	Why is my account locked for security reasons?<br>  <br>  <br>  If you receive a message stating that your account has been locked for security reasons, this means that there have been too many attempts to sign in to your account with the incorrect password. As a security measure, your account has been locked to prevent unauthorized users from being able to access it.<br>  <br>  If you haven't been trying to sign in to your account with the wrong password, this is not necessarily cause for concern. It could simply be the result of another user mistakenly thinking that your ID is theirs. (To learn more about account security, please visit the Yahoo! Security Center.)<br>  <br>  The lock on your account will expire 24 hours after it was initially locked—the lockout period will not reset each time you attempt to sign in while the account is still locked. You can try to sign in again after the lock has expired. We are unable to provide you with the exact time that your account was locked or when it will be unlocked.<br>  <br>  If you are still unable to sign in with your new password, please refer to our password problems help page for common reasons why you may be getting an "Invalid Password" error.

I also suggest you get a firewall installed on your computer. I recommend getting an anti-virus program, and one for mal-ware and ad-ware, after you make sure your computer is free from 'bugs.'|`|suPD7c3gaa	I'm a little confused.  Your friend had your password?  You actually told someone your password?  Sorry, but if you did that, you kind of deserve what you got.  It's because you gave your password out to someone that you might possibly have gotten your account hacked.  That's something you should NEVER do.  It doesn't matter what computer you are on.  There can be only one version of Yahoo! Messenger.  ANYONE with an account can log into THEIR Messenger on any computer that has it installed.  As long as anyone else is logged off, anyone else using that computer can log on to their own account.  So there was NO reason to be downloading anything.  Your friend was looking up something that was illegal.  That's no friend.  What someone got their hands on was your password, and possibly more than just for Messenger.  Consider it a lesson learned.  You don't EVER give out your password... even to friends.  I'm blown away that she did the search she did and then downloaded something that probably allowed your account to be hacked, and possibly put a virus on your machine.|`|X4vSvSqpaa	Just change your password

suPD7c3gaa	The example you gave here wouldn't be a link at all (as it isn't here).  You'd have to put the http:// for it to be a link.  It's also best to copy the link from the website rather than typing it.  It's too easy to make a mistake.  You can't get it wrong if you copy it and paste it into the message.  It could be just because you didn't type a complete URL, along with possibly miss-typing it (like you did in your example).  Be careful next time and be sure to put the FULL URL and see if you still have the problem.

After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info".

Also, if you try to access via different computers, make sure they are ones through a different internet connection.<br>  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, set up a completely new account by logging out of all Yahoo services. Then, go to any Yahoo sign-in page and clicking "Sign Up" on the lower right side (<a href="http://mail.yahoo.com">http://mail.yahoo.com</a> , is preferred). Go through that process, then try activating the 360 space for it using the instructions from the first paragraph. You can use only one Yahoo account at a time in Yahoo!

I've seen some people asking questions about a medical condition and they actually chose potentially very harmful advice as their best answer saying they would try that.<br>  <br>  One of the worst parts is that I don't think "bad answer" or "bad advice" is something that can be reported. :-(|`|snWybep8aa	I never choose an answer just because a lot of people thought it was good, i choose one if it makes sense, and i know what to do for a relationship, so that wouldnt matter to me.

If "no best answer" has the most votes, the question and all answers will be automatically deleted. If 2 or more answers have the same number of votes, or if no votes have been cast at all, the question goes into tiebreaker status, and will remain there until somebody votes for an answer and breaks the tie. Questions can stay there indefinitely, there's no time limit.

gGZz2EGyaa	There is good and bad everywhere not just on Yahoo Answers.  I would just ignore them and move on and enjoy yourself on here.  I would not email them at all about their comments, it only annoys them and they report you for no reason.|`|ZA11WBR2aa	If 2 or more people report a question or an answer, it gets removed automatically.  Its the policy and can't do much about it.  I've noticed that even some answers you give get removed without even being reported.|`|2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	No, they don't look. The reporting and removal process is an automated one. The answer, of course, is to NOT make contact with them, thereby provoking retaliation. If their answer is a violation, report it. If not, ignore it. I'm sorry, but retaliating by sending nasty emails is not the 'mature' response.|`|r2bbLMUZaa	The removals process removes a question immediately, but gives you 48 hours to appeal the decision. This is all sent to you by email.<br>  <br>  Simply appeal the removal and your question will be reinstated. Also the reporting user will have less reporting clout next time round.|`|AA12150589	No, YA takes down anything that anyone complains about. If you know it's probably a bratty teen, then let it go!

AA10689311	You should have e-mailed them back because that shouldn't have been in violation.  Contact Jane now she can help you a lot.  Also there are many people on here that abuse the report abuse button, that should be its own abuse.  Although there is a small amount of people that run it, they don't have time to check the details of specifics.  Another thing people are hypocritical, a woman wanted a name suggestion for her puppy in Polls and Surveys and someone reported her for an innocent question in the correct category, when someone right above her was asking about anal sex and what not.  Just try to contact Y!A and leave suggestions to how they can better the site for yourself and for everyone else.  ?|`|6b024523fb38135686ccfa239cad7bcdaa	Yahoo answers is run by socialist gastapo nazis who delete anything they dont agree with|`|AA10208357	i have no idea sorry|`|AA11104489	Who knows.

AA11307940	Well no, Yahoo doesn't have that option, there is no way to know when or what time we log in. It's easy for me because I have to sign in every 24 hours, so I would know if someone was using my account. You could install a keylogger, availabe at computer/electronic stores.|`|nkpRxWLgaa	I don't know how you can do that.  Wouldn't it be simpler to just change your password and stop allowing him access?  What do you plan to do if you can check the log?  Face him with it?  If you change the password and he questions why, that's a tacit admission, anyway, right? Many people change theirs frequently, anyway, just as a safety precaution.  It's an idea you might consider if you're having this kind of problem.
xl2isudZaa	hey funky farmer not sure if ure trying to read or send so try this (1 is for writing and 1 is for reading)<br>  <br>  1) Are you trying to read characters in a non-US-language email? If so, you can change Yahoo! Mail’s character encoding setting. It’s easy! Here’s how:<br>  <br>  At the very bottom of the message, under the message window, look in the lower-right corner, where you'll see a down-arrow next to a pull-down menu with the words, "Select Message Encoding". <br>  Click the down-arrow, and from the list that appears, select the encoding that matches the message’s content. <br>  Note: In this case, changing your browser’s encoding setting will not work. <br>  or<br>  2) Your country/language setting – what Yahoo! Mail calls your “Preferred Content” – can be adjusted by following these steps: <br>  <br>  Click your username in "Welcome, username" at the top of your Mail page. <br>  Re-enter your password. <br>  Click Edit to the right of “Member Information”. <br>  In the General Preferences category, click the Preferred Content link. <br>  From the pull-down menu in the “Preferred Content” window, select the country you want. <br>  Are you seeing garbled characters? If so, click here for instructions on adjusting your browser's character encoding setting.

It doesn't matter what your settings are, or how many times you click no and ignore, the only way to stop it from popping up is to let it pop up, and then slide the request off to the side and behind your other programs or chat windows. Out of site, out of mind. Anonymous can only request to view once, as long as it stays in a pending state, it can't request again.

Also, I went through my profile and disabled anything that appeared to make my information public for communication.  I hope this helps! It certainly solved my troubles.

Anyone can report for anything and no one responds to violation abuse emails.|`|154127eeb6dd779e547e8b5aba2c3387aa	I haven't been a regular for long but i have a couple of dislikes since the changes  like 1. this deciding which ansewers i would want to read and hiding the others, I don't like the idea of someone deciding what my opinion will be before I decide it even based on how others voted on the question,I set it to ALL Ansewers and it still censors the ansewers so i think it should just be removed let me decide the ansewers i like. and then the censorship on here you can make yahooligans and yahoo seperate you should be able to set it up so Adults can be with Adults and kids with kids. In fact that goes for all of Yahoo and you shouldn't wimp out to a minority of complainers just because they're vocal and driven, just because they're loud doesn't make them right. and finally my last complaint would be the way abuse reports seem to be handled , I spend a lot of time in the politics section and it seems the right wingers just go on reporting binges of those that don't agree with them someone should read the messeges and thread of said messeges and make a decision just an automatic remove is kinda wrong. I've been reported for harassment for making critical observations of talking heads from the TV like O'Rielly for instance and because the person didn't like the term talking head it was harassment. Someone who is a rational ,thinking, GROWN UP should read and decide on these reports before they're yanked might even cut down on the abuse of the reporting button.|`|AA10076104	Well this will probably get removed too, but I am going to go ahead and post it anyways.

I mean, I still like Yahoo Answers ok, and they have more members right now than the other place, but at least there there is a more friendly feel to the site, and people are more appreciated.

7387e6c115c3e73674c3ab5985e1e6e3aa	Why is my account locked for security reasons?<br>  <br>  If you receive a message stating that your account has been locked for security reasons, this means that there have been too many attempts to sign in to your account with the incorrect password. As a security measure, your account has been locked to prevent unauthorized users from being able to access it. <br>  <br>  If you haven't been trying to sign in to your account with the wrong password, this is not necessarily cause for concern. It could simply be the result of another user mistakenly thinking that your ID is theirs. (To learn more about account security, please visit the Yahoo! Security Center.) <br>  <br>  The lock on your account will expire 12 hours after it was initially locked—the lockout period will not reset each time you attempt to sign in while the account is still locked. You can try to sign in again after the lock has expired. We are unable to provide you with the exact time that your account was locked or when it will be unlocked. <br>  <br>  If you have forgotten your password, we recommend that you request a new password online. After you receive your new password, you can try signing in again after the 12-hour lock has expired. <br>  <br>  If you are still unable to sign in with your new password, please refer to our password problems help page for common reasons why you may be getting an "Invalid Password" error.|`|1a5974f7cab35c065ec18599f483edcfaa	stop trying to spy on your wife , OK  we see right through you buddy boy|`|AA10227539	She changed Yahoo! password.<br>  If she lost that password,the Yahoo!eMail will begin a recovery program.<br>  You need to remember your ZIP code,date of birth and security question and answer(all you entered in Yahoo!account).<br>  <br>  If you really want to access your account send a fax to Yahoo! with your signature(or with signature of your wife).<br>  <br>  I think your email is not recoverable any more!

I had a similar problem recently, and here's what I did.<br>  <br>  Go to your internet security program, and TEMPORARILY disable the firewall. Then attempt to sign onto messenger. If you can, then there's the problem.  <br>  <br>  Next, disconnect from the internet, if possible, for security from attacks, while you're doing the following.  Remove your Internet Security Software, restart your computer, and re-install the security program.  Re-connect to the internet, and everything should work fine.<br>  <br>  I've spoke to some Techno-Gurus, who have told me that there is a type of messenger virus out there, that slips through the security program, and causes the firewall to block the site it came through. I would suggest to not stay signed into ANY messenger program, if you're going to be away from the computer for long periods of time. This is NOT just an issue with Yahoo Messenger, I have friends who use other messenger services that have experienced the same problems.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Well, there was servers outage reported by many people last couple of days, however at least some of them reported all back to normal since:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://geocities.com/alqa_21/yahelite.html" rel="nofollow">http://geocities.com/alqa_21/yahelite.ht...</a> <br>  <br>  Hard to tell is all fixed now or are some servers still down. Bit interesting the press didn’t picked on subject – which would suggest probably rather maintenance or purposeful shut down rather then DoS attack or some catastrophic failure.<br>  <br>  Since you can log here, obviously problems are not password related. Considering that any reasonable troubleshooting could prove to be difficult considering it would be hard to determine are your problems are related to your PC or caused by Yahoo end, how about eliminating all possible causes by going back to older version?<br>  <br>  Taking into account that even during outage users of older version apparently had no problem with service (apparently only newest protocol servers were affected) , also taking into consideration that your connection problem could be caused by Messenger corruption or firewall misconfiguration – by going back to older version you could eliminate all tree possibilities in one move.<br>  <br>  In my personal opinion opting for older version (6.0 – 7.5) is good call even when not experiencing any problems. Versions 8.0 seems to be very buggy, produces large number of all sort of errors and problems, and it can be assumed it will take some time before problem will be seriously addressed by Yahoo. <br>  <br>  Yahoo liquidated in last year: two protocols, merged with MSN, released 3 new version of Messenger, as well most likely is busy addressing problem of IM worm which surfaced not long ago. Considering their size (30+ world location, 355 millions of users) as well understanding that changes require adjustments on thousands of servers it can be safely assumed that their technical recourses are stretched to the limit and catching with bugs and problems might take them some considerable time. <br>  <br>  Till that time relying on older versions which are way more stable better patched and safer – seems to me like definite way to go.<br>  <br>  If it sounds as a good Idea older version are available on following sites:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://chat-clients.com/content/view/422" rel="nofollow">http://chat-clients.com/content/view/422</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wackyb.co.nz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=646&Itemid=3881" rel="nofollow">http://www.wackyb.co.nz/index.php?option...</a> <br>  <br>  In any case don’t go below 6.0 or you’ll miss some important security patches.|`|c3326458be45d1bbe3655c3b48b0b49eaa	make sure the caps lock isnt on and take ur time

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Assuming you mean logging In and out:<br>  This most likely suggests connectivity issues with internet (check cables, ping router), other possibilities: some firewall or router configuration problems, less likely: someone booting you or using your passwords (if receiving massage “You has been signed out because someone has sign in with your name from different PC”).<br>  <br>  Try asking for help in Yahoo Chat Help:1 room (Computer & Internet – chat directory). That sort of problems are better solved when someone can ask you number of questions rather than reading description on board.<br>  <br>  If you mean starting up and turning itself OFF that woiuld suggest you are hacked.
a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Bad news - unfortunately no. You could make a picture of screen or part of screen with pic in IM but image would have very limited quality (no better than in IM).
a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Number of people attempts so called reverse engineering in order to understand functioning of Yahoo protocols (presumably third party Yahoo unofficial programs authors etc). Nevertheless program itself is so called closed source which means Yahoo doesn’t make public exactly what Messenger does or how it functions.
a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Sounds fishy. Could it be that someone is booting everyone you talking to (perhaps some room bully who knows who you PM with because you are saying so in room)? Could possibly mean that your Messenger is in some weird way corrupted and send corrupted packet which boots people. Could also mean you are hacked and someone simply boots everyone you talk to being able to see your screen (downloaded some strange programs lately, accepted files or clicked links?). <br>  <br>  Trouble shouting would require some investigating work therefore I would recommend asking for help in Yahoo chat Help:1 room (Computer & Internet directory) – where you can be asked questions directly and are able to provide answers.

Could you post link of page you are refereeing to in comments or add in PS in original post? <br>  <br>  I’m not sure are you referring to terms of page which opens account or some fishy site? I didn’t examined all terms of agreement while opening account with Yahoo, anyway all you will receive along Yahoo ID is free account, mailbox and ability to make free PC to PC voice calls (as long as you signing up for service from main Yahoo page: www.yahoo.com – after clicking link “sing up”, and another “sign up” button on following page). To make calls to land phones Yahoo will require you to provide separately additional information (fill out additional page) including Credit Card or other payment methods to which you agree. By opening free account you simply agree that you aware that calls to land lines are not free, but you don’t make any financially bounding agreement with Yahoo. Matter of fact you can give (and from security reasons probably better you do) some fictional personal information. Just make sure you have noted: DOB, ZIP code, Country and answer to security question which you gave Yahoo while opening account, and if gave them additional e-mail (its not necessary to give one) – it is working one. Yahoo will use provided by you address to communicate with you (send you notification of changed password etc). Noted information will allow you to regain control of account should you forget password or it became stolen.

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	By conference Yahoo usually refers to voice or text conference. Voice conference is basically a window which allows to talk with voice and text exactly same as in chat room – however require that each person be invited to room (it is impossible to enter it without invitation).<br>  <br>  Term video conference doesn’t really have any separate feature. Because while publishing cam it is possible to allow up to 30 people to view your cam and watch unlimited number of cams at the same time, theoretically it is possible for group of people to talk to each other while everyone sees everyone. There is however no any separate option for video conferencing same as with voice. Simply turn on cam, invite on it who you wish and request cam from people you want to view.

If you mean hack as taking total control of PC by taking advantage you are logged to Yahoo on Messenger alone – even there were vulnerabilities in past which allow that (and new could surface in future)  - very unlikely. <br>  <br>  Discovering and taking advantages of errors in code takes really top class expert and extremely few people on Yahoo would be capable of it and know how to take advantage of error (even if it exist). <br>  <br>  Accepting e-mail attachments, files from people from chat or clicking links CAN GET YOU HACKED HOWEVER in totally invisible manner for sure !<br>  <br>  To see why clicking links is dangerous download and listen to audition #7 from this page (fast forward to 20 min 50 seconds):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.grc.com/SecurityNow.htm</a> <br>  <br>  There was also not long ago discovered Yahoo IM worms which propagates itself by sending IMs to Yahoo users with links to maliciously constructed sites. <br>  <br>  In normal chatting chances of hack are little. There are some chances that someone could obtain your IP by viewing (or allowing you to view theirs) cam or IMing with you – should connection be peer to peer.

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	VPN are generally better than proxies in my opinion – considering that they are registered businesses. Sending your all data (including logging name and password) thorough someone’s God know who’s server is always bit of a risk and privacy issues.<br>  Someone could use your credential to conduct some fishy business afterwards, steal your account or perhaps hope for retrieving some financial information by reading your emails once knowing your password (like passwords to other accounts, CC numbers etc).  <br>  Because unlike proxy servers VPN providers are not anonymous it is less likely they would violate your privacy for any criminal purpose. <br>  <br>  Try this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iopus.com/ipig/" rel="nofollow">http://www.iopus.com/ipig/</a> - zero configuration extremely easy<br>  <a href="http://openvpn.net/" rel="nofollow">http://openvpn.net/</a> - little better and more reliable but anything but easy to configure<br>  <br>  iPig (first link) is quite sufficient for Yahoo.

(if scared look it up post it and ill look it and repost results – just for sake of not infecting people which could click it accidentally break URL, post warning link is malicious and instruction how to fix it, just to make sure that someone who would click it accidentally before reading warning don’t get infected).<br>  <br>  Since you know site has malicious code infecting with Trojan it would be advisable going beyond normal no IE, script blocking and proxy/VPN filtering procedure in order to look up page in safe manner– as for instance using software utilized by most AV researches themselves – virtual machine technology as: Parrarel, Vmware etc.|`|3b023af7d74bfb763d1ba1ff8b7cf8abaa	I suggest that you start by changing you password ---and do it again every 30 days or more often .  This may or maynot cure the problem, but if you are the one getting the bad messages from someone you know--then it's probably them and not you. Have them do what I just said.|`|83341c6709b1860d30d7358f213b9f76aa	yahoo. yahelite!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

726b92ed72c26f76faa1876213df46aeaa	That sounds confusing. Yahoo chat has room not web pages to log to and there is no any room named “gayles 56” on Yahoo. If you referring to some info which you found by clicking link on someone’s profile on Yahoo, that’s not Yahoo chat – … and watch out for Trojans,..
726b92ed72c26f76faa1876213df46aeaa	Even known error haven’t seen anyone proposing any solution – hence how about trying older version which doesn’t have this problem (6.0 – 7.5). Personally using one and all fine here.

af19353383de3ee4421bf2f01e55bcbcaa	Your present version of the messenger is now outdated. Yahoo has new one., Live messenger8.0 . First uninstall old version before downloading new one or you will have conflict! Be sure to copy your contact list before uninstall. because you will lose it in the switch! You can do uninstall in add/remove programs, in control panel|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Its hard to guess from your post what you mean by “Display window”? Chat room? Instant Massage window? Try reposting question being more precise.
af19353383de3ee4421bf2f01e55bcbcaa	The true answer is!! The older version of the messenger is not working any more because Yahoo has created the new Live messenger 8.0. You need to uninstall the old version before installing the new one or,  you will have conflicts with the new one. Be sure to save you contact list from the old version before uninstalling it (in add/remove programs , in control panel) Also the new version does not funtion correctly with Internet exlorer 7. so you will need to have IE6 or mozzilla firefox browser to use it!|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	Could mean that either your Messenger became somehow corrupted or you have bed sector on Hard Drive on which Messenger is installed.

a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	No official news. Strangely no press reports no official statements form Yahoo but it can be easily guessed why for some people it works and doesn’t for others.<br>  In one sentence: location and software version!<br>  Yahoo has over 30+ world locations:<br>  <a href="http://world.yahoo.com/">http://world.yahoo.com/</a><br>  Each version of Messenger uses its own different protocol: YMSG-12, YMSG-13, YMSG-14 etc etc. Obviously only latest version protocols servers are affected and most likely only some world locations (while some other presumably not). Personally I suspect it might be related to recent IM worm discovery. Perhaps some new added feature in newest version make it vulnerable and Yahoo decided to kill some server till they manage to distribute updates and patch vulnerability. Note that when starting Messenger it is being fed with updates even if you are not able to log in. But that’s really my own speculations and not something I know,…<br>  No one really knows for sure,..|`|6bc01a3193f5d9a2ff0f9d2aee221d52aa	I also have verizon yahoo, my messenger stopped working on Friday. I contacted Yahoo only to get the normal script. I shut down all virus checkers and firewalls uninstalled and re-installed and nothing worked. Verizon stated that I needed to contact yahoo and yahoo gave lame answers. <br>  <br>  I am a IT professional with an A+ certification trust me I tried every technique to make messenger work again! I simply think that verizon IE 7 and Yahoo 8.0 are simply not compatable. I think that they have some bugs to work out that they don't want to admit to. My solution to you is do a search for a earlier version of yahoo. Uninstall yahoo 8.0 from your add and remove programs option under verizon and re-install yahoo messenger 7.0 or 6.0 for right now, you can do a search for links to download an earlier version or get it here: <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.html." rel="nofollow">http://www.freecreed.com/ymsgr-archive.h...</a> <br>  <br>  I think with time they will work out the bugs... but if you are a yahoo junkie like me and miss chatting with your friends this technique works. I am up and running again!! No problems!! You can also use yahoo web messenger if you do not want to download an earlier version of the messenger program. Just do a search on yahoo or google for yahoo web messenger. Hope this works for you!! Good Luck!!

It was happened a lot to me, that when i go offline, im still showing online. it has even come online itself when i never came online. And at times it showed me offline when i was online. I think it is slow at times to update the current status, thats why it takes times, maybe due to load on the system also.|`|38e5e8c8830f751c563c2d25a307c70eaa	could be 2 different reasons one it takes a while to log out or two someone else is on your account|`|a540129ea63766743cab1ecbd0266224aa	In my opinion it is simply a bug (error in its code).

6ecd031c25bf1e0f8830a51714c13800aa	The newest version of Yahoo Messenger seems to have a lot of problems. It's been causing trouble for a lot of people over the last several days. I doubt very much if the problem lies with your computer, no matter how old. Best thing to do is uninstall the latest version you installed and then go to www.tucows.com and there you'll find the older version (7) to download.

A list of installed plugins should come up.<br>  <br>  (2)Look for "Yahoo! Application State" ("npYState.dll") in the installed plugins list.<br>  <br>  (3)If the file is listed, close Firefox completely. Open the C:\Program Files\Yahoo!\shared folder then rename the file "npYState.dll" to "XnpYState.dll". This will disable the plugin.<br>  <br>  Restart your browser and test your Y-mail. Good luck.
AA10395412	This seems to be a problem that comes up from time to time with many Yahoo Messenger users.  I have tried contacting Yahoo technical support to try and get help but they are useless.<br>  <br>  I have encountered this problem several times (as well as my entire messenger contact list disappearing for no apparent reason) and it usually fixes itself.  It is quite frustrating.  I have tried several things such as changing my password, uninstalling and reinstalling Yahoo Messenger and logging-in with another Yahoo ID.  Nothing seems to fix it and it seems to have something to do with the Yahoo ID that you use.<br>  <br>  For example, I was receiving this problem with my usual Yahoo ID but did not have the same problem using another Yahoo ID on the same computer.<br>  <br>  I tried contacting Yahoo technical support and their answers weren't worth crap.  I was somehow able to fix the problem on my own but still have the sign-in problem occasionally (like yesterday afternoon).<br>  <br>  If you are desperate to use Yahoo Messenger and cannot get it to login, you can login via Meebo (www.meebo.com) temporarily.  Yahoo also has a web version of their chat program which can be located at the bottom of their official messenger page (messenger.yahoo.com).  You can try that as a last resort.  I wish you luck.  It almost never works.|`|836620f9462ceda3c7e2a9780fd472e0aa	I am having the exact same problem.  If you get an answer please let me know.  I am soooo frustrated!!  Thanks.

So yes wildwagon is right.|`|7a4f52dded470471be3aa924a9dc79e0aa	whilst talking to someone on MSN you will notice at the bottom left of the chat box is a little webcam icon-click on this and it will ask the person you are talking to if they will accept your cam, if they say yes then it will go on automatically. I assume when you got the webcam you did install all the relevant software that came with it so as it would run on the PC? If you did that's how to use it on MSN.

Also check your connection preferences on your IM.<br>  <br>  I think we are just going to have to be patient for now.  Good Luck!|`|OKj0HJ2Taa	I have the same problem when I use Vista. What operationg system you have ? I'm using <a href="http://wap.oa.yahoo.com/">http://wap.oa.yahoo.com/</a> as a back up untill i figure what is the problem. Also when I try to make a new ID i get the "The connection to the Yahoo! server cannot be completed at this time" error message. This may be because YM can;t see the servers (but my firewall is down now) or simply because they have problems with the new 8.1 software.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit :  I have uninstalled the YM, regedit and erased ALL the related entries (maybe was to much but i wanted to be sure).

8be9596d6e9def6d370aa33ae62a4187aa	okay what i would do is to reinstall messenger or repair it, and to repair it you goto start menu, then goto control panel, and then click on add/remove programs and then click on messenger and then once it is highlighted in blue click on support info and a little box/window should come up and then click repair and that should do th etrick, and alot of times with messenger the pasport network that supports it is down and will take some time to get back up before u can log on to it, just give it some time and it will work|`|e7f3f57570ee61afbd8084d453a78762aa	It is probably your firewall settings.<br>  When you first start messenger, click on connection - when you are not signed in there are only two different menu bar boxes you can axcess.  When you click on connection, it will give you four choices.  Connect with proxies, without proxies.  By clicking different ones of these you can try to open messenger that way.  If you know how to access the programs your firewall allows, you can also make sure that yahoo messenger is allowed to access the internet.  You can go into the settings of your firewall and click allow, outbound, or block.  If it is blocked or unassigned, like if you just installed new software, then you will have trouble with messenger.  I hope this helps you and if not maybe you can email me with specifics and I can help more from there.  Good Luck.

El ponerme a mi una estrellita por parte de los demas usuaros me hace sentir muy bien, y me agrada por lo mismo poner estrellitas a mis amigos y a preguntas que realmente valen la pena y asi transmitirles a mis amigos y contactos ke esa pregunta me gusto y que quisiera que todos la respondieran dando su punto de vista asi como yo lo hice... es bastante satisfactorio recibir estrellitas por que de verdad te hacen sentir que si es interesante lo ke ofreces cuando respondes o cuando preguntas algo... o simplemente lo compartes como es mi caso en cuanto a los chistes.<br>  <br>  A mi me gusta poner estrellitas ayuda a que todos sigamos compartiendo nuestros conocimientos, ideas, etc, etc.<br>  <br>  Saludos!!|`|72549ca87e9760d0b78f7017d0851119aa	yo no tengo q poner limites para brindar estrellas si necesito hacer preguntas las hago tambien.|`|47809c4f568e0ad226751136fbd15135aa	Solo otorgo estrellas a las preguntas que considero que son buenas o que han llamado mi atención y son diferentes o nunca se habia preguntado. Creo que para eso fueron puestas, no para "regalarlas". Puedo trasmitir optimismo por medio de mis palabras, no solo dando una estrella. <br>  Lamentablemente se desvirtuo el fin por el cual fueron creadas, el blog dice:<br>  "?Por qué deberías dar estrellas?<br>  Dar estrellas permite que la comunidad de Yahoo! Respuestas destaque las mejores preguntas del sitio. Cuando una pregunta recibe estrellas está incluida automáticamente entre las posibles candidatas a aparecer en la lista de preguntas Populares que se muestran en la página principal de Yahoo! Respuestas."

In other words, spam is crap.<br>  <br>  Spammers typically purchase or harvest a list of email addresses. They send messages from numerous different addresses to all areas of the Web. These messages tend to be "forged," to hide who actually sent them.<br>  <br>  We're committed to eliminating spam—eyuck! And you've got great tools to help keep spam out of your Inbox.<br>  <br>  Yahoo! SpamGuard<br>  <br>  Keep Yahoo! SpamGuard turned on. To check if it’s on:<br>  <br>  Click Options in the upper-right corner of your Mail page. <br>  Click Spam Protection from the list on the left. <br>  In the “Spam Filter” section, do you see “SpamGuard is ON”? If not, turn it on by clicking the link: Turn SpamGuard ON. <br>  In the area above your spam options, click Save Changes. <br>  In this same section, you can also specify how often you’d like us to empty your Bulk folder (we do it automatically once a month, but you have options to empty it faster), as well as indicating your preference for showing—or blocking—images. Image blocking is another way to fend off spam! <br>  Image Blocking<br>  <br>  Keep Image Blocking on. Image blocking defeats the “hits” spammers receive whenever one of their images is “viewed”—which can include the moment you select a spam message before you click Spam. Here’s how to block images:<br>  <br>  Click Options in the upper-right corner of your Mail page. <br>  Under Spam, click Spam Protection. <br>  At the bottom of the page—“Step 1 of 3: Spam Filter”—click Continue. <br>  At the bottom of the next page—“Step 2 of 3: Marking Messages as Spam or Not Spam”—click Continue. <br>  On “Step 3 of 3: Image Blocking”, select “Block all images”. <br>  The Spam button<br>  <br>  If you get a spam message in your Inbox, check the box beside it, then click Spam. This alerts us to the latest tricks and techniques that spammers are using, and helps us clamp down tighter and fight spam more effectively.<br>  <br>  If you change your mind or think you made a mistake, just look for the next message from that sender in your Bulk folder and click Not Spam to reverse your vote.<br>  <br>  Not do this with spam?<br>  <br>  Never open a spam message (or any message from a sender you don’t recognize) unless you have the "Block HTML graphics" setting on. If you view HTML images in an email, spammers are alerted that you opened their message. So how do you turn on the Block HTML function? <br>  Click Options in the upper-right corner of your Mail page. <br>  Under “Management”, click General Preferences. <br>  Scroll down to the “Messages” section, and next to “Security:”, check the box beside “Block HTML graphics in email...” <br>  At the bottom of the page, on the left, click Save. <br>  Never respond to spam. To the individuals who send spam, one response or "hit" among thousands of mailings is enough to justify the practice. <br>  Never respond to the spam email's instructions to reply with the word "remove" unless you trust or know the sender. Many spammers use the "remove" or "unsubscribe" links as a ploy to get you to react to the email. This may alert the sender that your email address is open and available to receive mail, which greatly increases its value. If you reply, your address may be placed on more lists, resulting in more spam. <br>  Never click on a URL or web site address listed within a spam email. This could alert the site to the validity of your email address, potentially resulting in more spam. <br>  Never sign up with sites that promise to remove your name from spam lists. Although some of these sites may be legitimate, more often than not, they are address collectors. The legitimate sites are ignored (or exploited) by the spammers, and the address collection sites are owned by spammers. In both cases, your address is recorded and valued more highly because you have just identified that your address is active.|`|gwqOvDHsaa	The term spam is widely believed to have derived from the SPAM sketch of the BBC television comedy series "Monty Python's Flying Circus".<br>  <br>  The sketch features a small restaurant in which every item on the menu includes SPAM canned meat, and a chorus of Vikings drowning out all conversation with a song consisting almost entirely of the word "SPAM".

The providers should not legally give the information to you as your name is not on the account.<br>  <br>  The more pressing issue is the lack of trust in the relationship.
