Rf2r23sYaa	Are you talking about peroxide hair lightener or the kind of peroxide you put on cuts (in the brown bottle in your bathroom)? Either way the answer is "yes" but the brown bottle will be less damaging. The only thing is- if your hair is not blonde to begin with (if it's brown or black) there's like a 95% chance you'll end up with some not so cute shade of orange hair.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	Yeah, I wouldn't use it on anything but light hair colors.  Sun-In+brown/black hair=nasty orange ooky color.<br>  <br>  Try real hair dye or bleach to color your hair.  Peroxide alone can dry out your hair worse than commercial dyes that are designed to put moisture back in your hair.|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	Anything you do to your hair damages it, so they say. But if you mean, will it fall out: not likely. Peroxide's a pretty mild way to lighten you hair. It's similar if not exactly what they use in "sun in."<br>  <br>  It's actually a very common and effective home remedy for lightening hair. And it usually gives hair a "natural sunkissed" look.|`|WUXUiLF3aa	Yup it really isnt good for hair any i wouldn't recommend it<br>  <br>  You can use henna dye that wont damage your hair, but you have to do it loads of times for it to be noticeable, but it does lighten your hair.|`|UyScHVIiaa	yea
6aEhPcDAaa	I would have to say hands down the MAC brushes are the best, they are mostly made of goat hair, and are so soft, and puts on the makeup really well.  They aren't exactly the cheapest, but you are definitely getting what you pay for, and in the long run its a good deal.<br>  <br>  Basically, to know if a brush is really good and sturdy, its pretty obvious.  Wet N Wild brush?  Not so much.  Maybelline? The brushes are okay.  MAC/other more high end brands? Great.<br>  <br>  You can also search up reviews on YouTube of the brushes.  And to answer your question, goat hair is probably the best :)<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!<br>  <br>  -Erica|`|JhJXKRkOaa	Depends on what make-up brushes you like, I got my make-up brush set free with a magazine when I subscribed to it, the magazine was called "essential guide to beauty". I love those brushes, there soft and stylish and most important not expensive.|`|U7TkLMScaa	Price deff. doesn't tell you if a brush is good or not. A lot of people think that a product, in this case brushes, are better the more expensive they are but in reality I have purchased many expensive brushes that were supposed to be high end and they were crap! MAC bruches are great! The last long, they don't shed and they are so soft. Coastal Scents has good brushes too. MAC's website explains their brushes and how to use them... hands down, I think they are tthe best so far!|`|Lwq12ZpTaa	I use to work in a makeup store for 4 years these are my favorite natural brushes -> bare essentials and studio gear. I also really like MAC brushes too! Remember to religiously clean natural brushes when you get them! They will last a loooooooooooong time if they are well taken care of. =)
zIiMnM8iaa	i  think it sounds like a really good idea! i don't no y any1 hasn't thought of that b4! seriosly, i'd say it would be a brillaint idea!|`|8DhmRwMraa	I think other than getting ur b-day and hihschol grad dayy it wud  be bad idea. Mabe just the date of ur friends death and ur future kids name. REMEBER THEY NEVER COME OFF.|`|MaDN7knJaa	YUCK!! no|`|UWK2ZERDaa	reminds me of angelina jolie's tattoo -<br>  all of her tattoos are fabulous and yes i think this is a very cool idea|`|m2bSgeRWaa	thats soooo cool. i would do that someday but im kinda chicken to get a tattoo lol|`|tbtTjevxaa	i think thats really cool. heck i might even do that|`|PxZZn94Oaa	I think its a tattoo and you need to make sure you really want this to be on your body for the rest of your life. I think that sometimes I say I like something or that its really awesome but then I always change my mind. And I wouldn't get the date you get married because that doesn't always last forever. Also make sure not to get the dates of a guys birthday because they don't last forever either.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and Good Idea, Hope it goes well!|`|hMZdgcImaa	Nope. I don't think so. Thats something you should write down on a beautiful Diary.<br>  <br>  If you love dates like these, you will end running short of space on your body eventually!! I highly recommend you get another tattoo idea.<br>  <br>  Your idea is good but there isn't much space for all the important dates in a person's life.. I hope that helps?|`|qfQ3gJV4aa	Well the thing is just think about what it would look like when you are really old and you don't have a great body and stuff .... <br>  Otherwise if you really want it then go for it.|`|rhZw4f7Yaa	awesome idea buuuuut not so much the graduation date =/ but thats very unique.|`|vwiEK6bsaa	excellent look at it as a landmark in your life good luck|`|Johbs7MVaa	Be careful...I just got a tattoo I thought I would like but I actually hate it now....so make sure you think it through....I wish I would have|`|9MiuKmBzaa	thats a really good idea-really creative <br>  remeber that ur going to have it forever-like when ur 80 or something|`|9QVjNaIPaa	if you like it go for it but i think its stupid. plain and original and nobody would know what they mean.
uYh1Dhvvaa	Yes, it is nice to have an expert take care of your hair.  It is a little indulgence. ;)|`|g7cP335Caa	i lovee getting my hair washed at the salon.<br>  it leaves my hair feeling extremelyyyy clean and<br>  nice for days :]|`|a4fec9ef194ad0c800457a3bf99c262baa	Oh yes I love it.|`|AA10639502	yes|`|FK8vokwpaa	oh yes please<br>  this fit lady washes my hair and we exchange small talk<br>  whilst she massages my head with conditioner<br>  she takes like half an hour but whos complainin? not me|`|7916c4d17333b435a55f05340490ade1aa	very much so its relaxing especially if your having a rough day. <br>  :)|`|RlvZHHu6aa	Yes, it is very relaxing, plus it takes all the stress away from me doing my own hair!!!
B9EifWApaa	Yes! I think you could pull that shade of blonde off, but maybe go a tinyyyyyyy bit darker than that, just so you don't look washed out.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	Yes.<br>  Maybe get highlights so it will look more natural.|`|1Nl2Jatmaa	I think it would look very nice.  Just don't pick too light of a blonde.|`|AA11461724	it would work on you ... but why would you want to make yourself look like every other bleach blonde bimbo? you have that face ... a nice face, but you have the look of one of those popular college girls, and with blonde hair i think you would look too much like the stereotypical bleach blonde airhead. that solid bleach blonde look is so common on pretty girls like you that it tends to be monotonous. every other really cute girl has bleach blonde hair. if you want to have blonde hair still, sure blonde hair is great, but not SO blonde. like a medium warm honey blonde, or a dark caramel blonde would look great on you! even a light reddish brown, or maybe just some caramel highlights! that would look great, but that solid, pure bleach blonde is so overrated. good luck! you're beautiful!|`|4XYjZNWeaa	yes but i think it is a very sudden dramatic change. Try a darker blonde and then gradually get lighter throughout the year x<br>  That way you'll look different every so often x|`|jZORzgQyaa	WOw YOUR PRETTY!!!!!!! Yes youd still look okayyy but the brown is sooo nice! I WANT THAT HAIRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|tbtTjevxaa	of course but you already look fabulous!|`|mMo2Dtraaa	I think it would suite you because you have very tanned skin so you wouldnt look pail or to orange So i think it will suit you :)<br>  <br>  but dont go a bleach white ish blonde more of a naturall :) like the picture :)<br>  xo|`|t4ODLJ7raa	Weird i got that camera too (for christmas). Ok anyway, no keep it brown, it may make u look like a dumb blonde who doesnt respect herself. And when u get roots????? U will want it back in like 5 months and your roots will show anyway.|`|871511324833ee801090472686782f12aa	Yes or any of these <br>  <br>  Black<br>  - Darkest Brown<br>  - Dark Brown<br>  - Brown<br>  - Light Brown<br>  - Dark Blonde<br>  - Blonde<br>  - Beige Blonde<br>  - Grey<br>  - Dark Golden Brown<br>  - Mocha Brown<br>  - Caramel Brown<br>  - Light Bronzed Brown<br>  - Darkest Red<br>  - Dark Red|`|6uhnyEYEaa	yeah, u wud! answer my question plz! thnx!          <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AiPlPV7yf_eJVFbEIHjQvjfD7BR.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220134024AA2VC61">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|b4v2zdHZaa	i dont think blond is a good hair color for you, considering you have dark eyes.<br>  -your very pretty!|`|wlr05dSXaa	yeah I think it would look great :)|`|lxpGFpBCaa	no not that light a blonde.. maybe more ashy/dirty blonde would be better. light light blonde wud be too drastic and look too fake like a wig almost|`|e9JRcA35aa	yea, i think it would. i would go medium blonde though.|`|B3OlFeffaa	I think it would look nice, but I think a dark burgandy would look better or light auburn, your current hair color is pretty and it suits you though :) but changing it up can be nice too|`|6CMfKxiMaa	no

I'm serious. You look like a berk for a few minutes and look fab for the rest of the day! It's an old bride's trick for the night before the wedding.<br>  <br>  If you are going to use it though, don't do what I did and use it right out of the fridge. Cut the slices and hold them for a moment 'till they warm up or your eyes will water loads!<br>  Keep your lids shut and place a slice over each eye. Rub them around a little then lie back for about 10 minutes or until nicely moist!<br>  <br>  I've noticed the shop-bought creams often have a cucumber base, but if you have eczema or flaky skin right now, best go for the most natural "active" ingredient.

No confirmation e-mail was issued, I have tried contacting them via telephone and e-mail, and guess what, I have received no response to anything.  Also, I have not received any merchandise.  If you check the website now, it gives you a message about the owner exceeding the bandwidth.  Thank God, I have an awesome bank, and I was able to stop the payment.  I hope my experience helps you make a wise decision.

rZSklXmXaa	nah, i dont think so. honestly.<br>  <br>  but try too eat healthy, exercise, drink lots of milk and water, and shower with oils that contains milk. <br>  <br>  it worked on me. <br>  good luck!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	yeah it is sure to show results. Rub olive oil into the scalp and massage to promote hair growth , leave for 1 hour and wash. Try <a href="http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://solutionsforhairgrowth.blogspot.c...</a> for more remedies and details.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	No, that will not change the rate at which your hair grows.|`|a7d1dc39931849d0bb98a1ce75f66b41aa	It might make your scalp feel good and make it healthier in general (massage=good, anywhere on the body, though the oil can be gross in excess) but I don't think it will necessarily speed up hair growth.  Maybe a little, but not enough to quickly grow in a haircut boo-boo.<br>  <br>  I've had too-short bangs before.  Yes, it sucks, but think of it as character-building (or an initiation rite.)  You can maybe blow-dry them straight and try a Bettie Page look while they grow.<br>  <br>  I know it's annoying because they're RIGHT THERE, right in front, totally obvious.  But really, they'll grow out.  They always do.  Try not to think about them too much, wear a headband or headwrap, try clips or pins or something.  Experiment.  Have fun.  <br>  <br>  Above all, don't take yourself too seriously.  You haven't lived 'til you've had to live through a bad haircut.  Join the crowd.|`|VNRJnNr2aa	Yes...it takes a year when using olive oil..you have alot of layer of skin on your scalp to shed off... your scalp does not shed off dead layers of skin the olive oil removes the dead skin to make new layers with healthy hair cells.<br>  <br>     also stress can make your hair fall out while maintaining hair that you already have olive oil taken orally takes away stress by removing <br>   toxins that promote stress if you have alot of stress its because your body fluids are full of toxins..|`|ALDeXn6Uaa	generally speaking, putting your hair in corn rolls makes it grow if you're African American.|`|pK7saLw4aa	well it helps get all the crap out of your hair and it helps it grown a bit but not much|`|WpAtF0MCaa	messaging ( however you spell it) your scalp and head and all that does make your hair grow faster.|`|uYh1Dhvvaa	Yes, it does.

hTr1dpTiaa	Make sure if you're using liquid foundation to always set it with powder to keep it in place and looking fresh, but not so much that you look dull. Try a translucent setting powder if you don't need more coverage (I would check Makeup Forever's HD powder).<br>  <br>  Also maybe try putting a primer on before your foundation to also keep it looking fresh throughout the day. It keeps your face from getting oily and it fills in all your wrinkles and pores. There are quite a few different ones at Sephora so just look and ask around, and I also think Revlon makes one if you wanted something a little cheaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|EkCzXUM2aa	start putting your makeup on in better light, so maybe a bathroom instead of your bedroom, lighting is a KEY factor in how makeup ends up looking.|`|Xyhg8Lc1aa	HMMM...Im not sure why it looks fine at home and ugly at school..<br>  maybe you should try cleansing your face every morning and apply lotion on your face, then put some foundation on that matches your skin, after that put on a little bit of powder. <br>  <br>  Keep a mirror in your pocket so you can look at your face every 30-60 minutes. <br>  <br>  Good luck hun! ;]
0KNR3ohWaa	I use Urban Decay 24/7 glide on and a eyeliner from N.Y.C.  They both work really well for me. The Urban Decay comes in many colors. They both go on smooth and last all day!

It has a spongelike smudger on the other end of the pencil that I use on my liquid liner to make it more natural and less harsh.

Your not too white. My skin is paler and with a hell a lot of freckles. :) <br>  I am really sensitive to the sun, 5 minutes without sunscreen outside, I start to burn. It sucks, but to me, white skin is not a flaw but a complimentry feature. I guess for girls it is diffrent though.. <br>  Anyways, you look fine. Dont worry about it<br>  If you lightened your hair a shade or two, it would look less pale.|`|HR6wT7ojaa	no, your fine. =)|`|chfILbonaa	No. I have seen much whiter people maybe you should wear a dark lotion if you want to look a little bit darker although you are a guy you can get a spray tan but you most likely wouldnt like it and you would have to get the lightest shade or you wouldnt lokok natural|`|vD5ysjwraa	Not really your good :)<br>  <br>  i mean look at me<br>  < btw that is partly because of the flash haha :)<br>  <br>  Theres nothing wrong with being pale anyway :)|`|vWKQJhwRaa	no, ur good|`|WHcvP8ZVaa	No you don't look too pale and seriously don't ever go tanning as a girl i think thats the most unattractive thing ever!|`|6RmWCmUNaa	You look fine, id give anything to look pale and not be pink all the time.|`|0AxzqheHaa	Not too white, no.

It all depends upon what the person's other features are. Like, if you have white-blonde hair, you should have paler skin. But your features match your skin color so well, don't be ashamed of it! Wear it proudly, because I promise you, there is nothing wrong with that skin color on you.|`|X4EYwvBkaa	Awww, you're not too pale! :3<br>  <br>  I myself admire guys with a deathly pallor and think that tans (especially orangey ones! >.<) are gross.

VPksp6SQaa	To be honest w/ you, I don't know what the brown liquid is for...my guess is it may be a toner that you put in w/ the bleach so your hair doesn't turn so yellow.<br>  The developer is the liquid<br>  and the powder is actual bleach...mix them together and they perfome the lightening action!<br>  It starts to process when they are mixed together, hence why they come separate...<br>  if you put mixed bleach w/ developer on your hair that has been mixed and absorbing air for like a few hours, your hair isn't going to lighten all the way|`|HQmAP5EVaa	developer is not what strips your hair of color... the blue powder is the bleach.. which is what takes the color out of your hair. the developer is what acitivates and determines how much lift you will get.<br>  <br>  mad hatter is incorrect on one thing: bleach is mixed in a 2:1 ratio developer:bleach...  <br>  and bleach isn't always damaging.. it depends on the level of developer you are using.|`|ym6pyUfIaa	Bleach strips any color from your hair and dies it the color you want it... in your case blonde|`|Rf2r23sYaa	I think the blue powder activates the developer. The brown liquid is basically known as a toner. That's what actually gives your hair the color. The developer (peroxide) strips color off you hair. If you only did that then your hair would be whatever color it ends up when stripped (everyone is different but most are really brassy). The toner then puts a decent looking color on top of the stripped hair. So, if you picked "medium ash blonde" then the color "Medium ash blonde" is what is in the brown bottle.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	Developer Activates the Bleach, The Blue Powder is the Bleach, and the Brown liquid is most likely the toner. You put the toner on after you bleach the hair. The Ratio for Bleach is usually 1:1, Which means, put as much developer in the bowl as their is bleach. Bleach strips your hair of it's color, and pigment..literally, When you bleach your hair NEVER go over the yellow blonde stage. You can't save already mixed Developer and Powder, because it won't work. <br>  Just to say: I would NEVER recommend someone to bleach their hair, as it's extrememly damaging, and can easily overprocess.

9XGTjIqMaa	Sandra Bullock is one of my favorite actresses and in the March '05 issue of Vogue, she admits to having had a rough time growing up. <br>  <br>  "I hated my whole childhood, hated it, hated it, hated it. There was no place for me. I was not accepted here. I was noticeably different. I was awkward. I was in the wrong clothes. I would get the sh_t kicked out of me constantly. My mother would be like, 'That's ridiculous. Why would anyone do that?' I'm coming home with my hair a mess, crying. Finally a guidance counselor came to my housse and said, 'We have a problem. They are picking on her, and I don't know what to do about it.' And I was so angry at my mother. She was like, 'Obvisouly something you are doing.' ... I'm so thankful for it now because it definintely gives you the empathetic view of humanity." <br>  <br>  In an issue of Teen People when asked about the best high school moment  Sandra said, "Realizing that conforming didn't accomplish anything. I was so preppy-everything was monogrammed and everything had to match. It was such a stress. Being popular was so much work! Do your own thing. As long as you learn that, you're<br>  cool."<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh and Drew Barrymore!! now SHE had a BAD childhood lol<br>  started drinking at the age of 9.. drugs at 10..<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtjrzWhp6po&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qtjrzWhp6...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Also, Angelina Jolie<br>  <br>  She was teased by other students who also targeted her for her distinctive features, for being extremely thin, and for wearing glasses and braces.[11] Her self-esteem was further diminished when her initial attempts at modeling proved unsuccessful. She started to cut herself; later commenting, "I collected knives and always had certain things around. For some reason, the ritual of having cut myself and feeling the pain, maybe feeling alive, feeling some kind of release, it was somehow therapeutic to me."[12]<br>  <br>  Jon Voight at the 1988 Oscar ceremony, Jolie can be seen behind himAt the age of 14, she dropped out of her acting classes and dreamed of becoming a funeral director.[13] During this period, she wore black, dyed her hair purple and went out moshing with her live-in boyfriend.[11] Two years later, after the relationship had ended, she rented an apartment above a garage a few blocks from her mother's home.[10] She returned to theatre studies and graduated from high school, though in recent times she has referred to this period with the observation, "I am still at heart—and always will be—just a punk kid with tattoos".[14]<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jolie#Early_life_and_family" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angelina_Jo...</a>|`|vpRERM9jaa	kelly clarkson-she was pudgy|`|JHOlfb1jaa	Nicole Scherzinger from the PCD was called 'ugly duckling'<br>  <br>  Or something like that because she's Hawaiian and she looked different from the other kids, where she lived...<br>  <br>  I can't understand why though she's stunning lol!|`|2tn8EALqaa	Angelina obviously|`|hTr1dpTiaa	Well, he's not a woman but Patrick Dempsey definitely wasn't that good looking in his teens!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.momisodes.com/wp-content/plugins/2007/12/patrick-dempsey-sexier-with-age.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.momisodes.com/wp-content/plug...</a>|`|9kMJJ1giaa	Cinderella<br>  Snow White<br>  Oprah|`|BeXHzsSwaa	angelina joli!|`|qanmHLpSaa	I heard Jessica Alba got teased because of her lips.

jbIvIsTpaa	hmmm.. this is tricking! <br>  i knowhow you feel though<br>  im16 and also 5'2 <br>  i have the SAME issues.<br>  but im a girl!<br>  so maybe i dont know what your going through.<br>  lmao that made no sense..<br>  anywayss.. 1. stand up tall. this make you taller right away.<br>  2. belts are your bestfriend.<br>  3. those skater shoes give height<br>  umm.. theres not much to do! just accept it<br>  GOODLUCKK! =D|`|hmAERNPAaa	First off, avoid really baggy clothes if you feel insecure about your height.  Bagginess can really make you look even shorter although you are slim.<br>  <br>  The best tip I can give you to look taller is to wear black pants/jeans.  Whether they be skinny jeans or whatever, black gives the illusion of slimness (which you already have) and height (which you want).<br>  <br>  Also, don't try to many outrageously bright colors because that just draws attention to you and then especially your height.  Just be simple in the way you dress.|`|F2gYMVQXaa	heh, im 20 and 5'4, i just wear jeans that are the shortest i can find and they still are too long but i figure i look ok in them, may as well not deal with the stress|`|NSepUdtFaa	my favorite clothing is:<br>  aeropstale<br>  hollister<br>  american eagle<br>  abercrombie && fitch<br>  <br>  wear high heels?? there really isnt a way to make you look taller.|`|iDEIbM5laa	wear vertical stripes
ugXymVAhaa	You need to re-style your hair maybe better application of make-up, lipstick etc...|`|HR6wT7ojaa	Your eyebrows are too thin.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	don't listen to what other say just be who you are|`|w226iIZmaa	idk<br>  maybe a new <br>  hair style thats <br>  not so frizzy <br>  and a shirt that <br>  doesnt show so much|`|HO9RGUx9aa	you don't need to chage|`|J30Gh5O6aa	idk i would let ur hair grow out.|`|4D43f70gaa	well, i'd start by not listening to what the females say (unless you are a homosexual, in which case, ignore the males).<br>  i don't think you should change anything to look better.. although, i do prefer the top left photo, if that's of any use.<br>  I'd "judge" you above an 8.. but everyone's got different tastes. People may judge you an 8 simply because they know of people they find more attractive, not because they find you unattractive or flawed.<br>  As per self-consciousness, make a list of things you like about yourself and focus on those things.. or find someone you think you look like that you think looks very attractive and remind yourself of how good looking you are by thinking of that person.. and just feel comfortable with being yourself in general.<br>  <br>  p.s. some people look far better with short hair as opposed to long hair.. and some people prefer people to have short hair as opposed to long hair.|`|T6hPiwhfaa	I agree with most people, it's your hair that you can change.  Long hair is the key factor in most attractive women.  I don't care how beautiful someone looks, if they lose their hair, the attractiveness is gone.  If you are a natural blond, I'd go for the looks that the girl on "Chuck" has (yvonne strahovski).  If you want brunette, I'd go for evangeline lilly's hair style on this season's "lost".|`|9uUouiwlaa	NOthing i guess. Maybe you can make your teeth white. YOur teeth are kinda yellow and smelly.|`|Smy7Mwjsaa	you are not an ugly girl but you should maybe wair some pretty eyeshadow to brighten your face and maybe you should darken your hair|`|WHcvP8ZVaa	you would look good with choppy layers,rim ur eyes with eyeliner(brown) and if u wanna go this far a nose piercing would look really cute!
U7vLYGodaa	I love them both. the conch is way more painful though|`|g3IXprk9aa	I personally would go with the tragus because I think it looks better then the conch piercing. <br>  <br>  You could go to:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Main_Page" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.bmezine.com/index.php/Main_P...</a><br>  <br>  Just click on piercings and look up the ones you want to get.

n3pSWkg0aa	i have brown eyes, but i always wanted green or blue.<br>  i think people forgot because brown eyes are sometimes the most common eye color you see is brown, and when you see blue, green, gray, etc. you forget about the brown eyes because those are more unique.<br>  but i agree brown eyes are beautiful|`|JHOlfb1jaa	Brown eyes look gorgeous on a tall, tanned man with dark hair...<br>  <br>  Yummy lol :)<br>  <br>  EDIT: I don't even know what colour my eyes are i think there bluey green lol...|`|2tn8EALqaa	wtf???<br>  no!|`|HhpRxYSLaa	brown eyes are beautiful. All eye colors are beautiful! I have brown eyes and I use to want lighter colored eyes, but brown eyes are more earthy and have a mysterious alluring quality to them.<br>  <br>  Brown-eyed people should be happy, brown eyes are gorgeous.|`|ipiCyE3zaa	probably because a lot of people have brown eyes so they aren't considered to be as special. i have blue eyes, everyone suits the colour they are given x|`|PxMNxytjaa	because everybody is different.|`|Yize9k0Iaa	brown eyes arent beautiful. they are so common and BROWN! i love green :)|`|iHna2K7Gaa	I think it's because brown eyes are so common genetically. Blue or green eyes are much more rare. I have brown eyes, and I absolutely love them. They're a mahogany shade of brown...almost like a deep red-brown. I guess it's just preference really. Like blonde vs. brunette. So many girls nowadays dye their hair blonde, but I personally think brunette hair is so much prettier and richer looking.|`|WHcvP8ZVaa	i have brown eyes i guess ppl just forget because alot of ppl have brown eyes less have blue and green maybe.my sis has green eyes and i'm jealous ppl are always telling her she has beautiful eyes i've never gotten that before so u are lucky to have green eyes!!|`|2U4U22cxaa	I love brown eyes on girls I find it very attractive. Plus they say men might like blue eyes or green because its exotic  at times but they always want to marry the brown eyed girl because brown eyes seem safe.|`|s7seaaPkaa	i have brown and i always wanted green.<br>  i think is just because everyone has brown thier to common <br>  and everyone wants to be different.|`|YawWNDvyaa	i think they all say sumethin different even if u have green eyes and someone else does like u can see a toughness kindness sadness they say ur personality so i think MOST eyes are kool to look at!|`|HpjT3URGaa	i agree. i have brown eyes, and i dont really like them cos nearly everybody has them. <br>  <br>  I looove green eyes and have always wanted them! ;)|`|2yEQE2U4aa	I think people forget about them because there the most common eye color|`|0ELgI53Uaa	i think its because every one in magazines think green or blue is amazing<br>  <br>  Well i have brown eyes, i would KILL for green.. It always seem like ppl with green or blue eyes want brown and ppl with brown eyes want green or blue<br>  <br>  Same with hair. i have curly hair, i would kill for straight hair and my mom has straight hair ans wants curly hair

9N0p5MNWaa	I've used it a friend's place and I didn't like it much. It was okay,but  a bit clumpy and not very black. But I LOVE my mascara that I use now!! Its called LashExact Waterproof Mascara and its in a purple tube with a blue stripe. Its very cheap and available everywhere.<br>  <br>  It has NO clumps, ever, even when I apply 3-4 layers. Its smudge proof, as I arrive home from a day out and my eyelashes look exactly the same, even if I've been rubbing them all day. <br>  <br>  Its also very waterproof. I had a shower after forgetting I'd applyied mascara. I put my face directly under the stream of water, and when I got out, it was still perfect. <br>  <br>  And I saw The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, and I cried my eyes out, but my makeup was flawless! My friends were amazed as they'd seen me crying, but my mascara was perfect.<br>  <br>  I even go to the beach with it on! I highly reccomend it to all my friends. And I have medium brown eyes too. And if you want a good eye make up remover, try Garnier Clean and Sensitive 2 in 1. Its great!|`|52e5f21e23013a4be422d7f4b0127f18aa	I think the mascara looks black! my friends wear it and it looks black and i think it would be a really good mascara for girls!<br>  maybenot the best but you know what i mean!

OuaUAAZlaa	no. even if you were planning on getting the piercing and then avoiding mosh pits, that would hurt terribly if you were accidentally pushed or shoved. since you said it was a hardcore concert, youre definitely going to get shoved by accident.<br>  <br>  also, once you get a hip piercing, youre not supposed to really be jumping around for at least a day or two, because your shirt is gunna cause a lot of irritation anyway- jumping around is going to be extra irritation.|`|c2uywBsIaa	ewww|`|cee2c58f93b765261dc687513be3aa9baa	not today. it will be very irriated for a while after you get it pierced and you should allow it sufficient time to heal before you go anywhere where they might get caught and possibly ripped out. plan a time where you can chill out for a bit while they heal, then rock them for the world :)|`|IM7nzdjbaa	I know people who have had their hips pierced before and their bodies eventually rejected the piercings.

HvRB6HHIaa	THIS WORKS PERFECT, GET REALLY BRIGHT RED, AND WHEN YOU ARE FINISHED TANNING, GET AN ALOE VERA PLANT AND SPREAD IT CONSTANTLY ON THE AREAS THAT ARE RED. YOU COULD USE A VERY MOISTURIZING LOTION TOO! YOU WONT PEEL SINCE YOU SKIN WILL BE MOISTURIZED RATHER THAN DRY, AND THE RED WILL TURN TO TAN.

That way your skin isn't in complete shock at first. You might want to try a moisturizing tanning oil, which will allow you to tan but also keep your skin hydrated. I suggest going to a tanning salon and asking what they recommend for your specific concerns and desired tan. They get those questions all the time, so they would know exactly what to recommend for you.
BUz3WwLyaa	If you are female, wearing a light foundation will help your "face color" to not be so noticable.

You're never too young to start taking car of your skin. You dont need anti-aging creams yet however. Make sure you use a good cleanser, a good facial scrub a couple times a week, a good moisturizer, and a good eye cream. Most eye creams are made for anti aging, but there are a couple made for hydration which is what you would use. Try Neutrogena Healthy Skin eye Cream or Aveeno Eye Brightening Cream. The key is to keep your skin moisturized and hydrated to prevent wrinkles. Oh and wear sunglasses all the time so you dont squint!!|`|GHZ3fZlsaa	Anti-Ageing creams don't necessarily do anything for anyone's skin.<br>  <br>  Lots of the brands on the market use chemicals which can cause health problems over the years - or if they contain Methyl Paraben will actually prematurely age your skin.<br>  <br>  Ensure you remove your makeup (try a cream cleanser) before going to bed as that will really help your skin.<br>  <br>  Sounds like you need an eye cream to hydrate, I use an organic one frrom Pai, their Echium Eye Cream - Echium is an anti-ageing ingredient, but it isn't marketed as an anti-ageing cream...probably why it is only ￡16 (lasts about 6-8 weeks) rather than ￡50!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.paiskincare.com/product_details_5.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.paiskincare.com/product_detai...</a>|`|dXrHoLMCaa	gee, we called them laugh lines.... it's never too soon to treat your skin right.... but that anti-aging stuff is costly, so I would wait until I had a good job and the money to pay for it....|`|a29qiNkvaa	you are never to young to start think and using an anti-aging line!|`|85458c6d6b43aa2c656b983aafc206aaaa	You're too young right now, wait until you're 30. Estrogen levels start to drop then Anti-aging regimens can begin. Until then stay hydrated. Don't harm your skin with sun damage, use daily sunscreen, or smoke and you'll delay anti-aging even further.<br>  Maybe a serum for keeping eye area hydrated is enough for now.
U6CF0Gh0aa	I think I started around 19 or 20, but at this age you don't need anything intense. Make sure you're wearing an SPF of at least 15 everyday, since sun damage is what causes a lot of wrinkles.

MNus8Qsiaa	I take lots of time. Sometimes, I prepare my outfit, including jewelry and the hairstyle, the night before because I don't want to do it in the morning (I go to school; I'd rather wake up later). Even in the mornings, I take lots of time preparing the outfit and looking good. I only apply eye line, but I still make sure I look good, actually perfect, before I head out. If the outfit doesn't suit, I change. If it seems outdated, I change. So yes, I do care a lot. I think it is important, at least for me, to look good. It is not for anyone else, especially not for idiotic guys, but more for feeling good myself. When I look at myself in the mirror and I look good, I feel good too. I get people who don't care about how they look; it is their point of view. But for me, I still like looking good. You feel good inside and out.

I throw them on, run to the fridge, finish off the beer no no I mean the bottle of apple juice and on a dead sprint down the driveway i make it as the doors are opening to let my friend and me on.

It should work in your hair since your already dirty blond then it will lighten it and it should look really cute!

Click that website to learn about natural lip enlargement which will give you full, plump, big juicy lips that im sure you wnat. It explains the best products to use and how they work.  This is what one girl said after she used a natural lip enlargement product off of this website:<br>  <br>   -----I tried the Lip Fusion natural lip plumping and lip enlargement prouduct and after about five minutes I looked in the rear-view mirror in my car, and I noticed that my lips were suddenly <br>  plumped up noticeably.

First put a smooth layer of lip balm on all over your lips.  <br>  - This will keep them hydrated and won't make your lip gloss/lip stick caking and cracking.<br>  <br>  2).

OuaUAAZlaa	before applying any kind of makeup, make sure your face is freshly washed.<br>  <br>  i HIGHLY recommend Avon's MagiX Face Perfector for youre moisturizer or foundation. it makes your face look flawless without even wearing makeup (it actually visibly reduces pore size); however it can also be worn under makeup.<br>  <br>  im not a big fan of foundation myself, because i feel like it takes forever to put on and it never looks right even if you have the "perfect" shade. my suggestion is to try a pressed powder or some kind of mineral wear- because they wont ever look cakey, take a much shorter time to apply, and are better for your skin.<br>  <br>  as for brands, i love physicians formula. they have amazing pressed powders that blend really. also, they sell a mineral matte finishing veil that makes makeup look flawless (can be worn alone, or over makeup)|`|KH9HROrSaa	-make sure you have the right shade, go to a beauty supply store a department store and have them match it professionally! make sure to change your makeup seasonally because your skin tone does change.<br>  -you can apply it a few ways:<br>  -with a brush(clinique makes a good one) put a dab of foundation on your hand and then paint a line on your cheeks, chin, nose, and forehead. then use your brush to blend it out.<br>  -with a sponge, try these they're supposed to be amazing!<a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P228915&categoryId=B70" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a> dampen it slightly and do the same thing you did with the brush.<br>  -but in my opinion the best application is with your fingers. wash your hands with cleanser, then do the same things as above.<br>  to get that glow that they have mix a drop of illuminator in with your foundation, or try a slightly shimmery highlighting powder:<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P99809&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=5648" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  in park avenue princess<br>  <a href="http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jhtml?id=P186415&shouldPaginate=true&categoryId=1254" rel="nofollow">http://www.sephora.com/browse/product.jh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.eyeslipsface.com/products_minerals.asp?dept_id=1194" rel="nofollow">http://www.eyeslipsface.com/products_min...</a><br>  ^ that actually has the perfect amount of shimmer<br>  -make sure to blend down to your neck, color doesn't stop at your chin, use some water to soften the line.<br>  -avoid using bronzers all ove ryour face.|`|oCovgwwNaa	those pictures are airbrushed honey so no matter how perfect your foundation is, it will not look like that.<br>  <br>  <br>  i suggest a liquid foundation for a fresh dewy glow. apply it over your moisturizer using a sponge wedge. if you want fuller coverage apply with a dry sponge and apply with a wet one if you want a sheer finish.<br>  <br>  apply the foundation onto the sponge and put a dot on your forehead, cheeks, nose and chin. blend it using downward strokes so it doesn't clog in the tiny hairs on your face and make sure you blend evenly. don't apply too much as less is more. if you feel you need more coverage then apply a dab of concealer to problem spots.<br>  <br>  blend the foundation down past your jawline so it doesn't look like you're wearing a mask. make sure the foundation you use matches your skin tone. it's best to shop around to find one you like. <br>  <br>  once you have applied your foundation you can either apply powder over the top of it for a matte shine free look or you can leave it as it is for a fresh dewy complexion.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. x|`|GItWq2mGaa	FIND THE RIGHT SHADE<br>  <br>  This is the most important step to a natural looking finish. Too many women choose a shade that is too dark. Remember, your foundation should match your skin as closely as possible. Its purpose is not to make you look tan.<br>  <br>  To get the perfect shade, first determine if your skin is fair, medium, or dark.  Also consider the undertones of your skin. Most women have yellow undertones to their skin, while others have pink . You want the undertone of the foundation to match the undertone of your skin. However...I would caution those with pink undertones to try a foundation with a yellow undertone because sometimes adding a foundation with pink in it can make you look too pink.<br>  <br>  Now, pick three shades that you think come closest to matching the tone of your skin. You cannot judge the true shade of foundation based on the color in the container. To get exactly the right fit, you must blend it into your skin. If you can get samples of the shades you are considering, all the better. If not, you may have to purchase them all and return those that aren't right.<br>  <br>  Avoid testing foundation colors under artificial light like fluorescent. For the truest light, grab a hand mirror and position yourself in front of a window. This natural light will give you the truest representation of color.<br>  <br>  The right shade should disappear into your skin and look natural. What you DON'T want is the "mask" effect--a foundation a shade or more darker than your neck.<br>  <br>  FIND THE RIGHT FORMULA<br>  <br>  It’s important to choose a foundation that is made for your skin type. Is your skin oily? Then look for foundations that are oil-free. Cream to powder foundations, which typically come in compact form, are a very good choice too.<br>  <br>  Dry skin needs the extra moisture that a cream or whipped foundation provides. These formulas also tend to provide a little more coverage. Liquid foundations that hydrate your skin for several hours after application are also an option.<br>  <br>  Normal skin will find a liquid foundation to suit them best. Look for foundations that do not have oil added. If you want a sheer coverage look for dual coverage foundations that can be used with a damp sponge or dry as a powder.<br>  <br>  Regardless of your skin type, look for foundations labeled non-comedogenic. This hard-to-say phrase simply means that it doesn’t clog your pores, which could lead to blemishes. It’s also a good idea if the foundation has gone through testing for skin irritancy and allergy.<br>  <br>  PREPARE YOUR SKIN<br>  <br>  Okay…you’ve got the right shade and you’ve settled on the formula. Now let’s put that foundation where it belongs: on your face.<br>  But not so fast. Is your face ready?<br>  <br>  Make sure your skin is clean. If not, go grab your cleanser!<br>  Once cleansed, apply a thin layer of your usual moisturizer and…wait. Allow several minutes for your moisturizer to be absorbed into your skin.<br>  <br>  Now your skin is primed and ready to <br>  <br>  APPLY THE FOUNDATION<br>  <br>  Repeat after me: Less is more. Less is more…<br>  <br>  Use foundation sparingly or you’ll end up with a cakey mess that looks anything but natural.<br>  <br>  If you’re using a liquid foundation, dispense an amount into your hand the size of a pea. For cream foundation, use a little less. (We’ll get to the Cream to powder users soon. )<br>  <br>  Using your index finger put a dot of foundation on the center of your forehead, one dot in the center of each cheek, a dot on your chin, and a tiny dot on your nose. Now gently blend the foundation in with your fingers using upward and outward strokes. Be gentle! No need to stretch the skin or push hard.<br>  <br>  If your skin tone is fairly even, use foundation only on the areas that need evening out.<br>  <br>  For Cream to Powder foundation, use a sponge and drag it gently across the foundation. Use the same gently, upward and outward strokes and blend evenly.<br>  <br>  Should you use a sponge to apply foundation? Well, that’s really up to you. Some people find it easier to control and reach tight areas with a sponge. Others like to blend with their fingers because the warmth from their hands helps to blend the foundation. Apply foundation with a cosmetic sponge for the most even application. You also use less foundation this way. Run sponge under water and squeeze out until it is just lightly damp. For a little more coverage use the sponge dry.<br>   <br>  Now look in the mirror. Did you blend well so there are no streaks? Do some areas need a little more coverage? A little less? Go ahead and adjust as needed. When you’re finished, your skin should have an even tone and there should not be a visible line where your foundation ends, at your jaw line, and your neck.<br>  <br>  Yea! All done.<br>  <br>  Not so fast…<br>  <br>  SET YOUR FOUNDATION<br>  <br>  Now that your face looks great, help keep it that way longer by setting your foundation.<br>  <br>  Find a loose or pressed powder that matches your foundation as close as possible. You’re going to apply a light dusting over your foundation.<br>  For loose powder, dip the tip of a powder brush in the|`|is4zQxltaa	the best way to flawlessly apply foundation is to find a foundation that flawlessly matches your skin tone. scheduling a appointment with a makeup specialist at places like ulta, sephora, or a MAC store is the best way to do this.<br>  <br>  next, applying the foundation. liquid foundation will get that dewy look in the pictures you showed. apply some to the back of your hand or a makeup palette. taking a large fluffy brush (like the kind used for powder or blush) tap it into the foundation. stipple the foundation on your face, sarting on your forehead and working your way down. blend out any harsh lines around the chin and where the neck begins.<br>  <br>  here's a great video on how to apply foundation (the girl has so many awesome makeup and hair videos, she is fabulous!) <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_ns_gF-6E&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bn_ns_gF-...</a> <br>  <br>  hope this helps girl. :)

It's never caused my eyes any problems either. It performs exceptionally well and looks fabulous. In fact, the only thing I have against Bad Gal Lash is the atrocious price tag. That's a lot of money especially considering I already have two, much less expensive mascara's that I adore. I can't say I'm going to buy a tube of BeneFit's Bad Gal Lash each time I need to buy a new mascara when I can pay $14 less for one that works plenty well. Perhaps if price wasn't an issue, I would; but c'mon $18 for mascara – mascara that is only supposed to be kept around and used for 3-4 months? Forget about it!
AIuN5Lw9aa	You can make them look bigger but you can't make them bigger. They just have to grow on their own. Unless you are flat as a board, don't fret about having a smaller-size chest.<br>  <br>  I've been a B all my life (except when I was pregnant) and I've never gotten any complaints. ;-)|`|M8HVkIikaa	push up bra..vitamens?|`|f36589e6e79860b7c91907c99e22a735aa	I don't recommend surgery because it's fake.  Stuffing is bumpy.  JCPenney's Ambrielle Extreme Push-Up Bra is amazing!  I think you're talking about something to enhance them.  I don't think there's anything safe or healthy.  But gaining weight, pregnancy, and just patience will make your breasts bigger.  Birth control does too, but you should have a valid reason for being on it.|`|vDpcn2n7aa	Push-up bras make them look a tad bigger.  You could also try gaining weight..<br>  But in your case, wait a few years.  You're probably still growing.|`|3tiH3rEZaa	Its ok let them grow in, your young|`|Da8WCIrjaa	Gain weight|`|Z5rIQE7Gaa	If you live weights it can help improve your appearance, especially chest presses and using dumbells while lying down and lowering them to your sides and then to the center of your chest. It can give some more definition. Plus weightlifting helps your posture. Underwire bras can help, they don't need pads in them to do this.<br>  <br>  Plus exercise is great. You can strengthen and tone legs, arms stomach, your whole body and it will give you an overall better appearance.|`|uQO1Lx9Iaa	trust me this will def. work i tried it and i got awsome results! massage your boobs. do 100-300 circular motions. and in about a month you will see great results! if you do it more than once a day you will get faster results. if you dont wanna do that then i guess you can just wear a push up bra.<br>   <br>  hope this helps!|`|6RmWCmUNaa	If Your young just let them grow, if your thin and want your boobs to stand out where tight tops or tops with V necks which show the top half of your chest. it might help anyways|`|NMdUVtViaa	if you get pregnant, they will increase in size becuase your mamory glands will activate and start producing milk|`|sxP8G12zaa	Depending on your age, go through puberty first.|`|4PMAa3FEaa	Gain a little bit of weight|`|5EVirKW7aa	get fat. then lose weight in the stomach area

9XGTjIqMaa	I love astrology and I strongly believe in it, however I will only listen to a good astrologer that can give me really good insight about my PERSONAL horoscope. The horoscopes on the paper and websites are so generalized and only there for amusement, sometimes you can relate and they are spot on but sometimes they're not because they are written for the general public. You shouldn't pospone or not go on your trip because you're afraid of what it said, are you gonna do this everytime your horoscope says you shouldn't do something? you could be missing out on alot of things<br>  <br>  I say go on your trip and have fun<br>  leave that worry behind, you don't want to take bad energy along with you!! :)|`|JUYjyP0xaa	I am pretty sure it just means this week mabey next week don't worry about march you will be fine. If you still are worryed take a friend along.|`|zvuDmY6Zaa	wow you sound like an idiot. HOROSCOPES ARE STUPID! why the he11 would you put off your plans to go to detroit??? you already paid for it.. just go!|`|634jf1L4aa	Don't let a horoscope control your life!  You should be in the driver's seat, not a bunch of words some guy made up that somehow applies to millions of people all at once.  Hmmm, guess 10 million people shouldn't travel today according to your horoscope, right?  Doesn't that sound ridiculous?<br>  Ok, if you still don't believe me, try this.  Continue doing whatever you were going to do regardless of what your horoscope says and then see if anything happens!  If nothing happens, then you'll know it was a bunch of crap!|`|jrtog7rUaa	well its talking about the planet's position is saying a lot of change isn't the best for you. If you are unsure of what to do, always change other horoscope so you would have a better idea of what to pinpoint. Although it is said not advised, it didn't really say avoid at all cost. Besides it change day to day so just check with other source|`|BT7t8aWaaa	Just do it.<br>  And See for sure if this "Horoscope" Crap works.<br>  <br>  Because really, it doesn't.|`|ipiCyE3zaa	seriously, dont cancel because a stupid horroscope <br>  some journalists just made it up in about two seconds<br>  of course you will be safe<br>  enjoy! x|`|HiuZs5G5aa	omg your an idiot. sorry but if you honestly believe in that your crazy.
Dfqu7UTJaa	Totally NOT cute. <br>  <br>  For those of us who have no CLUE what Twilight is, and don't care, "Boys who sparkle," is just stupid. <br>  <br>  Handbags should make a statement about YOU, not about what kind of stupid fad you're following currently. <br>  <br>  Thank goodness I'm not the only person who feels this way.<br>  <br>  xoxo|`|qzkWahFeaa	Yeah it was a Twilight bag. The lead male, Edward, is a vampire, and the vampires sparkle. So the sparkly boy thing became one of the trademark sayings/designs. Some are cute, some aren't.|`|AA11383707	Real boys don't 'sparkle'. <br>  Real boys aren't like 'Edward'.<br>  There are no vampires.<br>  <br>  So... the whole thing is just, wow. It's out of hand.|`|3L9bRmOqaa	I would have never thought of that tote as a "twilight" bag.  "I heart boys who sparkle" means to me "I love gay men".|`|WLMvNnKnaa	What it has to do with the movie:  In the movie, vampires sparkle in the sunlight.  So what the bag is implying is that the person loves Edward Cullen. (or vampires)<br>  And, no.  I have never seen or heard of that bag until now.|`|fIpnTq3Vaa	vampires sparkle wen they r in the sun sooo.....plus they "dazzle" ppl|`|1990ffa1edcbd831575bbd4b9a0d28f2aa	i guess but they sound cute and look cute as well|`|9yMRbtK5aa	it would have to do with the movie because in the movie, edward goes out in the sun to show bella how much of a monster he is, and when the sun hits his skin, he gets really sparkly.|`|Ym9bRgcDaa	Depends. Some are cute, some not.<br>  <br>  The reason it says that is because when vampires, such as Edward, go out into direct sunlight, their skin sparkles.

AA12270507	I modeled some in my teens and early 20's. First, my parents paid ALOT of money for a professional sitting with a local photographer so I could have some pics. Then I contacted a local modeling agency and they had me come in for an interview, looked at my portfolio(pics) and basically did a overview of my assets; height, weight, skin condotion, looked to see if I had any visable scars.....that kind of thing. It tooks quite a few months on them sending me to different locations and cities for more pics, sittings and alround bullcrap. But I did a little modeling for JC Penney, Sears and a few other catalogs and advertisements. It is EXTREMELY difficult and HIGHLY expensive to get into the runway type modeling if that's what you were looking for. But most modeling agencies are looking for at least a height of 5'10. At your age, I really don't know if you will reach this height. As far as looks, different agencies look for different types. I was in modeling for quite a long time, and I just trying to be honest with you ok...Your cute, but cute doesn't cut it in modeling. Judging by your picture alone, I have to say that you don't have much of a chance. <br>  Hope I don't hurt your feeling, but I trying to be honest.<br>  <br>  But like I said, agencies don't always go for the drop dead gorgeous looks alone. Agencies always need and want different types and looks. If this is truely what you want, then go for it. Remember, you will have doors closed and people saying no, but you just have to keep going and not give up.<br>  <br>  -I'm happy you do have a healthy self esteem, because the modeling industry is cut throat and people are brutally honest with listing any flaws or slight imperfections you might have. You need a tough exterior to deal with these types of people.|`|q7mActnmaa	I think you look like my momma when she was like sixteen.<br>  I think you are very pretty.

Just try it! You don't know untill you try!<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|UMBhfklTaa	get the side bangs! my friend has the same face shape, and her sidebangs look amazing on her. pretty much everyone looks great with them, actually.
AA11461724	in my opinion, that's really stupid. hair is hair and it shouldn't matter what color it is. they can't say anything about the cut and style it is, so get the cut you want! and if you want to make your hair 2 colors that are natural, that sounds like a way around the system to me. i think when it says "only natural colors" they mean no blue or green or pink. i think it would be safe if you wanted to dye your hair blonde, black, auburn all in one if you wanted 'cause they're "natural" colors. try black and bright red, or blonde and bright red, or brown and red. i personally would do really light blonde, black and really bright, deep red - all of your hair red, black highlights and blonde tips. i don't see why 3 natural colors would be bad, that would look awesome! good luck! tell your parents that the colors you want ARE natural, just not your natural color. lol|`|EQPE72hpaa	How about a light platinum blonde.<br>  Or you could get colored extensions.<br>  By the way, sorry your school won't let you dye your hair.<br>  That must really suck!|`|8MVrUtbAaa	Black and orange. Orange looks good :) <br>  Or black and blonde :)<br>  xoxo|`|omtn7gJmaa	you can be punk with natural hair. the definition of punk is no stereotypes.|`|KGRikkJeaa	just put like 4 random colors. blonde, black, red, brown...all different streaks...|`|qzkWahFeaa	Black and platinum blond?<br>  Red and black?|`|h3VqVwbQaa	Just say "but purple is my natural colour, I have a weird genetic disorder and my parents will sue you if you make anymore references towards it!"

Toodles loos!|`|VFMdpVccaa	black and white and blood red if you could get away with it
T6hPiwhfaa	To be honest, those highlights don't look good.  the brunette/blond combo never looked good on anyone.  You should emulate evangeline lilly's hairstyle or moran atis.  They are both brunettes.|`|oIkSKTTXaa	you're actually really pretty and your hair right now is nice! but i think those hair styles are VERY cute for you saying mostly because that is almost your same hair colour and the blonde in there is cute. have fun and hope i helped:D|`|lc9nus8taa	it would be ok but don't get the white highlights=tacky|`|U9QSOLUtaa	I think that would actually look really good on you. You have the face to pull it off.<br>  However,<br>  I think you should do it that short. With it longer, it would still look okay, but I think part of that style, that look, is the short, sassy length.<br>  Overall, you can rock it.<br>  Good luck!|`|e9JRcA35aa	Yea that would look good, but i would cut it that short if i were you. if you don't want it that short, i wouldn't go much longer or the style might not look right.|`|XYIijuE8aa	Yea that would look awesome.|`|4NDE11Xmaa	ur very pretty and i think the style would look nice on you, even with it that short :)|`|1NLuejtyaa	i say no.<br>  Just cause only a few people could pul that off.<br>  I think you can get your bangs vut like hers and the same layers. but without the extra blond in there.... and probably  like as long as you have your hair now..but with the layerss going pretty short|`|YdkBbbjsaa	yeah it would look REALLY good!!!
2s9IZU7xaa	ok so I would wear cute pair of skinny jeans with black top and a cute purple skarf then some black boots would be totally cute show on some mascara, blush, then top it of with some lipstick with a clear gloss over it then bam you look hot|`|2AQRoDI0aa	well, your just going to watch a movie..<br>  so you should wear something like<br>  skinnies with a cute shirt and a cardigan just for warmth :)|`|EeabLB5eaa	Look one:<br>  Skinny jeans, flats, fun long sleve shirt ( movie theathers are cold), and a fun necklace. <br>  Look two:<br>  Layer a bunch of tank tops, denim skirt, leggings ( color dependeding on the tanks), and converse.|`|2CYfjPA6aa	Some cute skinny jeans, Cute top or sweater, and ballet flats.|`|SIdhw9hlaa	a good jacket over a t shirt<br>  some good jeans with flats<br>  <br>  it would be more helpful if you gave more detail! :P|`|I5zUsAmbaa	um jeans hollister shirt no words a necklace flats and more jewelry|`|KHP1o0ebaa	first of all, that movie sucked. now nice jeans, cute baby tee, and a girly hoody. make sure to put on some makeup and lip gloss so you can dress up this dressed down look. by the way, go see something else.|`|T5HhjMdiaa	i don't know if you noticed that nobodies gonna look at you in the theater<br>  and i am also unsure if you know that going to the theaters is pretty casual|`|8ej19fVvaa	jeans and a nice top. or a denim skirt and a nice top.|`|tm0rUy8raa	Well, whatever you're comfortable in I suppose. I'm sure you'll find something. Good luck. (:|`|0MDBmKmMaa	I heard that movie was EXTREMELY gay.<br>  <br>  I suggest you don't waste your money.|`|yVRnOawlaa	wear your favorite jeans. and a cute t-shirt
OuaUAAZlaa	wear converse or a bright coloured tie (like red).<br>  style your hair in a faux-hawk or mohawk. or wear a fedora (hat)|`|CRuxWsi0aa	Do you own a suit? If you do, wear it confidently. Just because you normally dress one way doesn't mean you can't do anything but. I know it's cliche but people usually don't give a **** what you wear.<br>  Now if you don't own one that's a different story.|`|KHP1o0ebaa	if you are really not in a band, lose the rocker shtick. if you are a ligitimate rocker go with this. black jacket and pants, red and white striped button down shirt, no tie,black shoes. or if the jacket has a funky inside, turn it inside out and wear it like that. trust me i do this for a living.|`|s2EEwpXLaa	I guess you could always wear a suit, just make it original or something. Like wear converse with it or something haha..<br>  <br>  or you could always wear the t-shirt with the picture of a tuxedo on it. :)|`|VFMdpVccaa	loose tie, open black and white stripeed jacket wit t-shirt underneath and black dress pants|`|1990ffa1edcbd831575bbd4b9a0d28f2aa	GO FOR A JOE JONAS LOOK ITS FANCY BUT ROCK STYLE <br>  hope you like it!!!|`|ATYmBW70aa	check you rep at the door- wear the suit.

339NqJ84aa	You will also need a motor to move the needle up and down repeatedly.|`|jtjISk6qaa	INFECTIONS!!! dont do it.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	ugh seriously i wouldnt do it. they look terrible, and you will eventually have to get a real tattoo to cover it up|`|AA10069553	Well in Russian prison (this is where I first heard it don this way) they burn the soles of shoes into ash, mix it with urine and when it is tattooed into the skin it usually is a light blue (like a blueprint on white paper). But don't because of infections. You can use guitar wire to scratch the skin and use India ink to fill it in then burn the ink into the cuts. My friend did it and said it worked nicely but his sister walked in on him as he was finishing up and made him clean out the ink. So either just ask your parents ,it works sometimes you never know (I asked my mom and she said I could if it was somewhere my dad wouldn't see but I got stabbed a few days before I was to get it so I didn't), or get an 18+ year old friend/relative/sibling to take you.|`|clInlnIqaa	You don't. You wait until you are old enough to get it done from a professional. You have no idea what you are risking by giving yourself a homemade tattoo.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ronjones.org/Weblinks/MRSA-Photos.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ronjones.org/Weblinks/MRSA-Ph...</a> That's something that is very very likely to happen if you give yourself a homemade tattoo. And this requires a lot of medical treatment. Not to mention you are risking other types of infection, hepatisis c, ink poisioning. You also have no idea how to put a tattoo on your skin, so you are risking severe damage to your skin, your nerves and blood vessels. Another thing is, your skin will most likely reject the ink. Leaving an ugly blob of ink and scar tissue.<br>  <br>  Just so you know, those infections can kill you. And I am sure you don't want to risk your health and your life all because you want a tattoo.

AA11461724	well if you really like your color, you should return the extensions and tell them that they don't match. if they won't take them back, that's stupid and i guess you'll have to dye your hair. the thing is you can't lighten dyed hair 20 volume dye, it will have to be 30 volume. loreal superior preference makes 3 shades of blonde hair dye that will lighten your hair up to 3 levels ... other brands will only lighten hair 2 levels. it's called les blondissimess - extra light ash blonde, extra light natural blonde and extra light beige blonde. and it will even lighten up your perviously dyed hair. you can find them here: <a href="http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/default.aspx#page=top{nav|media:_blank|overlay:productdetail//objectid+HCo12_38//|diagnostic:_blank|main:brandpage:superiorpreference|userdata//d+d//}" rel="nofollow">http://www.lorealparisusa.com/_us/_en/de...</a><br>  good luck!|`|0OeqHKRXaa	Its very simple.<br>  <br>  Go to any drugstore/hair salon/etc.<br>  Get lighter hair dye to match your extension.<br>  <br>  Come onnn, was it THAT  hard ? :)|`|1990ffa1edcbd831575bbd4b9a0d28f2aa	if you stay in the sun more often your hair gradually gets lighter or try dying your hair got to walgreens!|`|vpRERM9jaa	pour beer on your head and sit in the sun for a couple hours....or lemon juice|`|lWk05DxUaa	You can go out in the sun more often, just wear sun block, you can get it professionally done, you can bleach it yourself, and you can put lemon juice in your hair, it makes it lighter.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|HQmAP5EVaa	get it professionally done.

gEkLQWF4aa	Your  hair grows roughly about a 1/4 of an inch to possibly 1/2 an inch a month, so, it depends on how long your hair is now to say how long it would take to get that long. There are pills that you can take that increase your hairs health which helps it grow longer and stay strong without getting split ends. A pharmacist recommended Biotin to me, and I've been using it and it does help. But...I don't think you'll need it because that hairstyle isn't that long.

PK9TjQf4aa	Mine didnt hurt at all.

aSso3n7oaa	Yes you do need to be trained in the area. I'm sure you need to finish high school and go to a community college, at least.<br>  <br>  Body piercers don't make much money, though.|`|U7vLYGodaa	<a href="http://safepiercing.org/becomePiercer.html" rel="nofollow">http://safepiercing.org/becomePiercer.ht...</a><br>  <br>  you have to attend a blood born pathogens class and a first aid and cpr class, your state may require other classes as well. you then have to find an apprenticeship. which, is pretty hard to find. also it doesnt pay much anymore because there are sooooo m any piercers around. and its not something you do because it seems cool. theres alot of work and precision involved.|`|rYX6Owfraa	you need to go to a place that can give u a license for body art|`|g3IXprk9aa	You don't have to go to college or school to become a piercer. You usually apprentice, just like if you were going to become a tattoo artist. It's better to learn from someone who is already a professional piercer, rather then watch videos, read online, or just randomly pierce people to try to learn. <br>  <br>  Also, if you find a piercer that says they will train you for a week, that is not enough time to become a professional piercer. <br>  <br>  There is a lot you need to learn. Such as you need to know about sterilization, disinfection, cross-contamination and other health and safety issues before piercing.<br>  <br>  You also need to learn about customer service and sales, after all being a piercer is almost like having your own business. Most shops won't pay you much for being a piercer, you have to make the money most of the time yourself. It also depends on how good of a piercer you are and how many years you have been doing it. Plus, piercing can lead into you learning about other body mods that will take even more time apprenticing and learning.<br>  <br>  You need to know about jewelery, sizes, quality, needles, plus there are other tools you need to know about that you will use when you are a piercer.<br>  <br>  I have friends that are piercers and they took first aid and CPR classes. When working with people, their bodies and sharp needles, it is always a good idea to be prepared for any kind of accident that might occur. You will also learn how to properly handle the cleanup of blood, used needles and other medical waste that could be considered potentially harmful, as well as important hygiene issues.<br>  <br>  You main thing is that if you are serious is to find a serious professional piercer and ask them if they offer internships/apprenticeships. When they are teaching you, make sure you watch closely and take it all in. Ask questions, the more you know, and the more  comfortable you are, the better of a piercer you will be. <br>  <br>  Being a piercer isn't always a stable job. You can be really broke some days and then have good days and make some good money. Like I said, shops don't pay you like $8.00 an hour to be a piercer, you usually work off the prices that you have for the piercing you are doing and how much the body jewelery has cost. If you are a really good piercer then you would be able to up your rates a bit.<br>  <br>  If you are serious about this, I would say you could call local tattoo/piercing shops up and talk to the piercers there and see what they have to say, that way you can hear their opinions, thoughts, and advice. Which is better then people who aren't professional piercers can give you. <br>  <br>  You could also google or use those search engines and look up what it takes to become a piercer or how to become one.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you out a bit, good luck! :-)|`|3QGv54ynaa	I think you have to have at least a high school diploma and be an intern or assistant to a body piercer for a year before you are able to do it on your own.|`|JEpLjnGhaa	A love for putting holes in people...|`|Ev4uFu30aa	you just need a bb gun, some earrings and a lot of paper towels.
oCovgwwNaa	rub sudocreme all over your face before you go to bed and wash it off in the morning. you will see a big difference ! make sure you sleep with a towel over your pillow though.<br>  <br>  crush some aspirins with a bit of water (enough to make a thick paste) and apply it to your face.<br>  <br>  apply clear honey to your face before you go to bed, rinse off in the morning and sleep with a towel on your pillow.<br>  <br>  steam your face over a pot of boiling water. place a towel over your head to lock in the steam. once you've done this then wash your face with a medicated cleanser and then splash your face with cold water.<br>  <br>  drink 2 litres of water a day. seriously, it will make the biggest difference. these treatments can ease your acne on the outside but water will stop it on the inside.<br>  <br>  hope i helped. x|`|I0rOL46aaa	Sorry, but you need to buy something to wash your face.  I'd recommend Clean and Clear Advantage Acne, use a toner instead of an astringent, and use the light lotion moisturizer instead of a heavy one.<br>  Also, you need to exfoliate.  Use just a bit of brown sugar (not white sugar or salt, because the grains are too big and can damage your skin) and mix it with a bit of honey, as that's a natural moisturizer.  Use a very little bit of honey, though, and if you need any more moisture to make the scrub stick together, try a bit of water.  Use a bit of hydrogen peroxide on the tip of a q-tip and press it to the zit, hold it for a few seconds, then use a clean q-tip and dip it in fresh hydrogen peroxide.  Warning, this may be harsh on your skin, but this is the only thing you don't have to buy that can kill the bacteria that causes acne.<br>  Exfoliate three times a week, use a mud or clay mask once a week (you could also mash up a bit of papaya, banana, and oatmeal *not instant* for a homemade acne mask, but the chunks might clog the drain) and fill a bowl with steaming water, add a few drops of tea tree oil, and drape a towel over your head and put your face over the bowl (not actually in the water, haha) and sit there for about ten minutes.  I'd recommend doing this at night because it makes your face really red and sweaty, but that's how it sweats out oil.  The tea tree oil is good for getting rid of excess oil.<br>  I hope I helped!<br>  -- xo Alice|`|nJMINFQQaa	A really good home remedy is crushing up an aspirin tablet and mixing it with vinegar or lemon juice. ( it will kill all the bacteria ) And applying on the acne affected spots. When it dry of completely then wash it off with warm water.Try this 2 times a day. And you will see some results. <br>  Hope that helps.|`|vvVrbB4Daa	dont use acidy things!!!!!! but if it's cus yer skin is oily, put something like flour on it. it'll absorb the oil and give a matte shean. also you may want to wash your hair in lemon so the oils from your hair so they dont come down to your forhead!!! if you use really oily hair products dont use them.<br>  good luck|`|ucSTZRqraa	Try some white vingar, Hun.

T4rGYaKYaa	Proper removal of piercings is rather simple. Carefully remove the jewelry making sure not to pull or irritate the piercing.

QiPGVHGNaa	lather rinse repeat....and lather rinse repeat.......as needed :p|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Get your hair completely soaked with water by rinsing it for around half a minute.   Rub a dollop of shampoo, around the size of a quarter or a 2p, between the palms of your hands and smooth onto the scalp area of your head.   Massage with your fingertips, but not too vigorously! Do not mound hair on top of your head to scrub it, this will cause tangles. You can also use clawed fingers to get the shampoo into the scalp.   Completely rinse your hair until water runs out with no bubbles. This is very important for getting clean hair as not rinsing it out enough may leave a greasy film.   If you so choose, wash with shampoo again.   You can use a flat comb and comb out all the knots to make it EXTRA smooth before you add conditioner.   Run conditioner (a dollop size again, more if needed) through the middle and tips of your hair. Your scalp produces its own oils to condition the roots, so there's no need to apply conditioner there. Gently comb the hair at this point.   Rinse completely until the water running down the drain has no more suds in it.   End with a rinse of icy cold water. This will not prevent frizz, as many think, but will only temporarily make hair appear less frizzy. Also, cold water acts to "close the pores" of your hair (as it does with skin), so your hair will look shinier when it dries.   Dry the hair. If you are towel drying do not rub the hair with the towel as it is damaging to the hair. Instead lightly scrunch and pat your hair.         [edit] TipsUse warm water, not hot, when washing hair as hot water is bad for hair and strips it of color.   Don't be lazy! Make sure all product is washed out of your hair or it will look incredibly dull.   Massage your shampoo on your head for as long as you can; it's good for the scalp.If you have thicker or longer or both you may use more if you need to.   If your hair is greasy, then shampoo twice before applying conditioner. Shampoo, rinse completely, shampoo again, rinse completely, then proceed to condition.   People with curly textured hair may need to purchase shampoo that does not contain sulfates (ammonium or sodium lauryl or laureth sulfate) as it can be very drying for their hair. You can also consider not using shampoo and learning how to wash your hair without shampoo instead.   Finishing off with cold water gives it extra shine.   It's best to shampoo your hair every weekday and on the weekends shampoo and condition. Your hair needs conditioning treatment at least once a week|`|ObKFA5djaa	i wash my hair and scurb it really good    and i have short hair so i cant use conditioner every day      so i use condintioner every other day|`|SO6ISnGWaa	i massage it...  unto d scalp..|`|KvZutMEZaa	Follow the directions on shampoo bottle.

3L9bRmOqaa	I answered a similar question like this last week.  One of the RNs at the hospital I work at purchased one of these bags directly from the infomercial.  She was highly disappointed with it.  She stated that the bag looked cheap, not very roomy, and the "covers" did not want to stay up on the bag (the cover kept wanting to slip off to one side).  She immediately returned the bag.  What a disappointment since the concept is quite unique!|`|9MtKzSE8aa	To be honest i think they look quite silly, i mean why would you want to have the same shape bag with just different patterns on.<br>  But then again that's just my opinion.|`|AA11065140	No, but I'm sorely tempted.

Hope This helps    =)|`|ZyQFd6NVaa	Straight Hair  Even pin-straight hair requires some work before it looks truly sleek. Start with shine-enhancing shampoo and conditioner. Then, spritz damp hair with a light leave-in conditioner and blow-dry until almost bone-dry. Last, smooth on a few drops of silicone serum and finish blow-drying using a paddle brush.    1. After blow-drying curly hair straight, wear it with a side part. The extra weight on one side will keep it from getting puffy by day's end.    2. For the sleekest results on any tress type, use a 1500- to 1800-watt hair dryer when styling; anything less powerful allows your cuticles to curl up while you're blow-drying.    3. Don't try to blow-dry sections of hair that are more than an inch thick  the hot air will not be able to pass through. Opt for small sections and be sure to dry each thoroughly before moving on.    4. Look for styling products that don't list water as one of the first five ingredients. Adding moisture to your hair after straightening it is guaranteed to make it curl up again.|`|e4bfc4b7ae9cb835e6e24d9e4a6b9004aa	Bedhead does some really good products for keeping hair straight, check the site :)     answer my question pleasee;  http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...     xx|`|2404nDvSaa	thers this thing at the hair stylist they'll like give u a perm but its permanently straightened|`|ZWU7VHOzaa	Try some hair spray.    comment for comment?  http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...|`|p3GZERIsaa	If it's naturally straight then WHY put all the heat on it in the first place?|`|m53cNF4iaa	Strighten your hair and use that i think its like mousse kinda thing from house of fraiser you can buy in the hair salon it helps keep hair straight|`|oPnfdTWuaa	It could be the way your hair is sitting.

These are the steps that I use:<br>  Cleanse skin and the lace perimeter with 99% alcohol (dries really fast)<br>  Apply one or two coats of scalp protector to your skin at the hairline (allow to  completely dry between applications)<br>  Apply thin coat of adhesive and let completely dry (depending on the type of adhesive you use, you may need two coats.  Just remember to allow each coat to completely dry before applying the next coat)<br>  Apply the unit<br>  Gently press (not mash) the lace into the adhesive <br>  Tie a bandana around the hairline <br>  Don't comb or otherwise style the unit for a minimum of 2 hours (this allows the adhesive to set up and the longer you let it set up the better).  I usually do my applications at night or when I don't plan to go out for a long while.<br>  TIP:  Try not to get oils or conditioners near the base or hairline of the unit (this will cause the knots to loosen and the lace to lift); remember that your fingers can also be oily so use the alcohol to clean them as well.  I hope this helps in some way.  For other tips, join us at: www.thelacewigconnection.ning.com.

nypzET7Laa	I think it will look really nice. If it's just one streak of blue hair and and its on one strand, then it will really pop out and compliment your eyes. There are several girls at my school who streak their whole head with a TON of color, and let me say, it looks dirty and nasty. Especially if it's extremely bright. But one streak will look really cool and special. I think you should definitely get it. It will make a super-memorable birthday present.|`|UsEMh8V7aa	You should get a permanent blue streak. One of my classmates has a clip-on blue hair strand, and it looks really, really cool in her hair! Especially in black hair. I recommend it.<br>  <br>  Or, you could always do what she did- getting the clip-on one. If your parents are extremely unsure of this, get a clip-on one to show them. Then, after they are used to it, you could get the permanent blue streak.<br>  <br>  Highly recommended because they are stylish and very pretty. =]|`|4e61a6e4d329230de6805854ded0dbefaa	The color streaks look good at first, but they do tend to fade quickly.  I got red streaks in the front and the first time, faded within 1 week to an orangish red, so my stylist touched it up.  I let her redo it again on my last cut and this time lasted longer, but has still faded and doesn't look as good.  If you want it to be permanent, it won't be.  You will have to get it touched up often, but they can be fun for awhile.  My daughter bought the clip in colors and her stylist cut them to fit her hair style.  She can have color when she wants and it is always bright and vibrant.  If you go the clip in route, get good quality ones.  I have seen some pretty bad ones out there.  We got ours at the hair salon.|`|Lat2BDgeaa	It reminds me of something a kid would do, like at a carnival for fifty cents.. i think ur parents are right!|`|rw1rvYIFaa	i say you dont get it permanemt just temporary. then just use contacts any time you want to change the streak|`|yuHV59Yhaa	I think it's rather trashy.|`|cz9fRO6zaa	streaks of color near the front look good i think.<br>  i have had red for the past year and just recently changed to a light purple - i have black hair so they stood out. <br>  but i think im trying blue in a few months - not sure - but yea i think it will look good if you have deep brown, brown black hair etc or just dark hair. <br>  hope your parents let you<br>  mella X|`|d3N60SuSaa	Don't do permanent color.

b81H0vlYaa	I'm about your size, I would say a 3 or 5 in US Junior's and a 2 or 4 in Women's.  Different brands size their clothes differently, so if you are ordering online use their size chart with your measurements to determine the one to fit you.<br>  <br>  Sorry, no pictures, but you are a good size :)|`|48I58Awsaa	It varies.<br>  What store you would go and look for clothing.<br>  For example, if you'd want to go to Abercombi and Fitch the shirts & pants will be way small on you and you probably end up walking out feeling huge although you are perfectly normal size. It seems like this store wants you to be super anorexic skinny.<br>  <br>  Now for the regular store in the US, I would say you are a size 3 or 4<br>  but this also depends on what your measurements of your bust, waist, etc are.<br>  <br>  Have fun in the United States, girly.<br>  :)|`|MuzqSYjwaa	probably between 1 and 3 depending on the brand, and how you like the fit.|`|EzY40I8Eaa	whats your mesurements|`|l6eBtko7aa	Why would you wanna compare youself.

iYL37RfPaa	If your hair is long enough you can get a loose perm,  where they use bigger curlers rather that smaller curlers,  so you get that wavey look,  not all perms have to be tight and really curley,  You should go see your hairdresser, and they will tell you,    also if you don't fancy a perm,  just do two plaits on each side of your head, before you go to bed,  take them out in the morning and it will be wavey!!    xo|`|6oddWhmBaa	go get a perm  then mess it up with a little bit of wax|`|Sme8zvmDaa	get a perm... but get those big curls kind...

It was a full hair package in one can, you were able to use it on wet hair prior to blow drying and as a hair spray/gel on dry hair. It always washed out with ease and never left your hair weighted down. Although a small can is lasted as you only needed a small amount.   I have search for this product, but it seens to have dissappeared off the shelves from all my usual shopping haunts, I now search every shop just in case they have a hidden supply.     Having spent a absolute fortune on other products trying to find the next best I now have a cabinet full of part used sprays all with disappointing results - who wants flexible, not me I have very fine hair and it needs to be held firmly (glued)into place without looking loaded, or covered in white lumps.     As I have very long hair if I style my hair I need to have a hairspray that is going to hold and take the weight of my hair.Either that or spray on a large quantity of the stuff which always then seems to make my hair go like a rock, leaving dried bits in it and taking ages to wash out. However when I tried this product after a recomendation from a friend I found that this one worked a treat. My hair was in a style slightly up which needed a lot of hold and I was unsure it would even work with the weight of my hair but i was happy to find that it held my hair perfect and totally made my day. This product is about average price for a well branded product and can often be found in a buy one get one free offer.     this is one best bet. it seems that i've become a loyal buyer of this product. it keeps my hair up whatever and whichever way i wanted it to be. the smell is not too strong and it even compliments my perfume.   the reason that i first bought this product was that i ran out of hair spray! eager to please a group of friends at a posh restaurant with beatiful gowns and tiaras, what else can i do without something strong to hold up my hair? luckily, this save me. try it and see for yourself. it doesn't take much, so one swift shot at the hair goes a long way.|`|a5565417605b533189dbbb903dc7526faa	I actually use a curl shaping spray GEL.

Like when i wear this silk shirt it makes me get red rashes only on my arms.

ZyQFd6NVaa	Wash, dry, and brush your hair completely. Teasing wet hair increases the likelihood of tearing and damage. If possible, do this while hanging your head upside-down to encourage volume in the roots. If you have time, curl your hair before you start, unless you're looking to create a smooth look, such as a beehive.      Separate a single strand or section of hair, moving and clipping the rest out of the way. Generally, it's best to start with hair towards the top of the head and work your way down. Smaller strands (e.g. 1 inch wide) will make for stiffer volume and will also take longer.      Hold the strand up firmly with one hand and hold a brush gently against the strand, approximately five inches away from the scalp.      Lightly brush towards the scalp while continuing to hold up the strand firmly with your other hand.      The strength with which you brush should be firm enough to create tangles that offer resistance, but not too vigorous so that the hair rips or the brush itself becomes tangled.   Repeat the teasing motion until the strand has the desired volume. The curlier the hair, the less teasing will be needed. Spritz the teased section with hairspray and let it down gently.      Use your fingers to make a loose "cage" around the teased section, holding it in place (but not flattening it). Lightly brush the un-teased section of the strand down, using only the tips of the brush and making sure not to touch or weigh down the teased section. If you want your hair to look wild and crazy, skip this step.   Put the teased strand aside carefully as you work on teasing other sections of your hair.      Scrunch the hair when you're done teasing for additional volume.   Optional - Put teased hair up by pushing individual strands up at the roots, twisting them, and pinning the twisted part against the scalp.        Smooth over the surface of the hairstyle gently with a shine serum spread on the palms of your hands. Don't press down, though, or else the volume will disappear. This will help to compensate for the "rough" and "dull" look that teasing can create.   Un-tease hair by brushing it out carefully. Start at the ends and work your way up with each stroke|`|VEgv5NhSaa	Oooo    with the brush backcomb it so basically get a section of the hair and put the hair at the ends of your hair and brush up :0    keep doing this and you'll finally find a perfect style :0    oh and then add hairspray hehe :)|`|NFn7G28laa	I think you should cut it up to your chin-like a bob, then it'll be only layered once and it will be much more manageable and will probably look better.

fRX6sSdTaa	if you need REALLY curly hair, braids is not the best way to go.  Braids will give more of a wave, depending of course how tight you make them.<br>  <br>  A curling iron or curlers will give curlier hair.  the size of the curling iron will change the way the curls look.<br>  <br>  INSTRUCTIONS:<br>  Braid your hair when there still wet.

Reason being is that you can lose up to 40% of your length. I am guessing your hair is super curly which means when you dread it is going to lock easier but you could lose a lot of length. you could end up with tiny knobs sticking out of your head until it grows - which again could take a while - If I was you I would definately consult a professional locker who can advise you on the best tactics.<br>  <br>  Good Luck on your journey!|`|jqdgXcOeaa	answer mine?it's about johnny depp!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ahyp4gqzCvAvaDwVCBMYkazsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220141932AAFBcWX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AetljU8Iaa	DONT GET DREADLOCKS unless you keep it short like the second picture|`|DCcumpkOaa	I HATE DREADLOCKS<br>  <br>  ga ross

JoAC0p80aa	What's your natural hair color? I think you should dye it brown if that's not your natural color. That would look really nice. And you have gorgeous eyes, with your makeup, you should play up your eyes and wear smoky shadows, and dark liner. For you, since you have fair skin, you can pretty much get away with any color shadow. I think a dark plum, purple shade would look really good. And also, you should try getting a really edgy red lipstick or gloss, that looks good on us fair skinned people too. (Just dont wear the red lipstick and smoky eye together.. thats too much. Put emphasis on one thing at a time) And for the freckles, which are SO cute lol, you should just use some mineral powder to make your skin more even. I use L`oreal Bare naturale. It works wonders! If you do get that stuff, just make sure you moisturize before putting it on. Hope I helped! Good luck|`|QeIYOkfdaa	I think overall you look fine. You may not be the prettiest girl, but you shouldn't hit on your self-esteem too hard. Your hair color is beautiful, so don't dye it black. But if you want to change it, go to a pro hair stylist and ask her what she thinks you should do with it. The makeup is a little bad. Get new mascara, and change it every 3 months because bacteria can form. The eye liner also needs to be put on better. I f you can't do it properly, don't do it at all. You do have a terrible overbite though. I suggest asking your dentist what you should do. Trust me, if you think your ugly, then all those good-looking people must think they're hideous.|`|QmHhzydeaa	your not ugly.  a face without freckles is like a sky without stars, hun.  don't worry i've had those times.  Pamper your self a bit.  i like your hair however don't change it.  maybe try a less harsh makeup.  softer eyeliner, more natural.  your very pretty.  don't let anyone tell you otherwise.<br>  <br>  beauty is in the eye of the beholder.|`|Ps92aryWaa	from the first photo... <br>  I honestly think you would do good to dye your hair a darker brownish red color. do not try to hide the freckles, I would play them up with a sheer light foundation. Also you are wearing too much eye makeup. go for a more natural look with sage green or cornflower blue. the black is way to over powering for your eyecolor. lastly, i would suggest getting your teeth fixed. they look pretty bad. (sorry, just being honest)|`|0XcmGUjMaa	You are a pretty girl, but I thik that you have to choose something natural like Gold shadows in your Hair. You don't need to make your Hair Black.

ZyQFd6NVaa	The first tip I would like to divulge is probably the most valuable, and one I wished I had listened to. Before you can utilize any products or tools to attain sleek results, you absolutely must start off with healthy hair. Think of your hair as a fine work of art-an artist wouldnt make use of a canvas that wasnt pure and fresh, would they? You cannot use products that help mend split ends. While these products may help condition, they only conceal frayed and ragged ends and do not have the power to actually fix your hair. Split ends need to be cut completely off--and not on your own! Only a good stylist who actually invests ample time in cutting your hair and has experience with curly locks can properly assess the damage and decide how much hair needs to be chopped. Cutting off hair is never fun since it only grows on average ? inch per month, but it is a necessity.    The next step you should take to acquire gorgeous hair is one that requires being honest with yourself. As much as you love sporting a new shade as often as your daughters weekly Girl Scout meeting, you have to ask yourself if you are engaging in what I like to call hair homicide. Is your hair much healthier when you arent excessively dying it? Do you dye your hair so much that you can no longer remember your natural hair color? If so, it may be time to evaluate how important this is to you, and how important having healthy hair is. While I love that new hue of auburn and those golden highlights as much as the next woman, Ive found that my hair re-textured into a softness that I didnt know existed when I swore off the dye.    Perms and relaxers can inflict the same harm, and I have even found that semi-permanent dye that claims to be gentle isnt so, at least on my tresses. If you are determined to color for whatever reason, the best idea would be to go to a colorist who only touches up your roots as needed after initially dying. Curly hair in particular is generally more prone to damage due to the structure of its cuticle. When hair is healthy, the cuticle layers (seen only under a microscope) will appear to be in close, taut alignment. Unfortunately, for those of us with curly hair, the natural curvature of our strands causes the cuticle layer to always be lifted, therefore leaving our hair prone to breakage and damage, and also affecting the porosity, as well. When hair is damaged, it loses its ability to hold water and retain the natural oils that nourish and moisturize our hair.     Now that you understand the importance of keeping tresses trimmed and using only minimal dye on curly hair, I want to expand a bit on the topic of porosity and the reason why us curly-heads require tons of moisturizing. And yes, all of this information is necessary, since straightening those spirals can be the death of your hair if it isnt in optimum condition. As mentioned above, curly hair in general has problems retaining good levels of moisture, which is, by the way 8%. Dry and damaged curly hair can mean the ultimate in being dehydrated, and intense conditioners as well as moisturizing shampoos are crucial. However, tons of money does not need to be spent in equipping your strands with the products it needs. In shampooing your hair, you should keep in mind that while the type and quality of shampoo does make a difference, how often you shampoo is key, too. I personally recommend washing your hair with a moisturizing shampoo containing lots of natural ingredients 2-3 times per week as opposed to everyday.    Unless you hair gets very oily, frequent washings are only drying your hair out needlessly. If you use lots of products, a clarifying shampoo containing citrus extracts should be used on occasion since product build-up can prevent essential moisture from penetrating the hair shaft. Next, in choosing a conditioner, it is best to choose a conditioner that is moisturizing rather than one that helps with de-frizzing. Conditioners that specialize in taming frizzies are often silicone-based. While silicone can be beneficial in helping to protect against heat damage (which we will get to later), excess silicone clogging up your strands can prevent hair from absorbing moisture, which is the most important thing that hair needs to stay healthy. Choose conditioners that contain proteins as well as natural oils such as jojoba oil, sweet almond oil, or coconut oil. Neutrogena makes a great conditioner containing natural oils. Purchasing these oils at a beauty supply store and adding a few drops to your conditioner may be a good idea, as well. Even a bit of olive oil, which many of us have in our homes, can wrap frayed strands in hydrating moisture.     Now, for the part that youve been waiting for-how to transform carefree curls into sleek and straight stands-without inflicting too much damage. It should be known that any stress on the hair will create some damage, and that no heat protectant or amount of conditioner can prevent that. However, follo|`|5sCpMpbWaa	It maybe that your not straighteen it fully. Take it down and put it into same sections and straighteen this way.Hope i helped.|`|Vu91r84faa	how do you straighten it? are you applying some sort of a gel or a mousse?    if you're really curly, try ironing it. but iron it right, i do iron my hair and it last morning til night, but it would be curly again once it get wet.  it becomes frizzy because it's already damaged. so i suggest that you use a hair polisher with heat protect, first it makes ironing a bit easier, and it gives the hair some softness.    it would stay straight unless it had gotten wet.

Avoid straightening it, curling it, or using any sort of product that might strip it from it's natural oils. If you straighten/curl it, doing that is frying off the ends of your hair little by little.  Hair grows at different rates, it's different for everyone.
aTsdwft3aa	If you blow them to the opposite side that you wear them they will be more visible. Or if you don't want to blow dry them you can pin them to the opposite side of your face while they dry, and then push them back over to the other side once they are dry and it will create the same effect.|`|154dzJ1Faa	Because you only had so few hairs cut (in relation to the rest of the head), they can easily get lost.  When you shampooed your hair, they all joined the other hairs.  So now it is hard to find them, and separate them out.<br>  <br>  What you can do is hold your front hair in one hand upwards, and with a brush, lightly brush DOWNWARDS and to the front on the front hairs.  The shorter hairs should show themselves, along with some long ones too.  But at least you can find them, and taking the long ones to the back, leave the short ones for the bangs.  This is good for sometimes you just want to blend them all with the rest of your hair, and you can do that easily.  If you get a lot of hair cut for bangs, they are harder to hide.

c27920620869d3d5b40c4f7c78b6b42aaa	Honestly, they are all neutral colors, but it sounds like this outfit just has a lot going on! I think the gray and turquoise is going to clash. If you are going to wear something shocking like turquoise skinny jeans, pick black boots and a white scoop neck to go with it, or all black. Or even the tan boots an a white shirt. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps.|`|u7o75zipaa	Err too many diff colours.<br>  I think different shoes would make it look better.<br>  Maybe just some flat pumps in grey?

If you have something as bold as turquoise skinny jeans, then you should play them up as the main part of the outfit, not battle them with something else as bold as fur topped tan boots. pair them with some flats for a simple contrast that doesnt overpower the pants, If its the boots you want to play up then opt for a simple dark denim or black denim skinny jean.

It would be better to do something fresher and lighter.
Yy6GIHCuaa	I'd say experiment with different makeup, but not all at once, that way if it sucks ***, you're not screwed the rest of the day, lol.<br>  also, if you still aren't finding anything that works, then bring a mirror with you and touch up on your makeup... try and do it in between classes so your teachers don't get all upset.|`|zpovg4U7aa	Try using primers. Primers are put on prior to putting on the actual make-up. There are eyelid primers and face primers. For good quality primers, you should go to Sephora (the best is Urban Decay Primer Potion), but if you'd rather stick with the drugstore brands I'm sure they have them.<br>  <br>  Primers settle the make-up better and should keep them on your face a bit better too. after you apply your eyeliner on your lid, try going over it with a neutral colored eyeshadow so that it won't smudge throughout the day.<br>  <br>  Also the quality of the make-up is important too. Make sure you are using oil-free foundation since you say your face is oily. It's good that you are wearing powder too to set your foundation.|`|9Qi7L1WWaa	its because your make up is too cheap sorry to say but you should try a better make up! i use lancome for my mascara and eyeliner its expensive but it works really good. for the foundation i have the same problem lol but you could just put some more on at lunch.|`|99b5e8847127b6225db2c2933b5ee44eaa	Haha, I'm Asian too, and I had that problem too until I watched one of the makeup guru's makeup videos, and they said if you use eyeliner/eyeshadow, always use a neutral colored base to help it last longer. Too-Faced Shadow Insurance is a decent investment, although a bit pricey.  <br>  I suggest switching to an oil-free moisturizer like Dove instead of using foundation every day. It'll work wonders for your skin and help you immensely in the long run, trust me =) If you must use foundation like on the weekends, use a foundation primer.|`|JnSpwXSXaa	Maybe try a different eyeliner. I have 3 different brands at the moment and one ALWAYS runs after about an hour, but the other two are fine for a day. The crappy thing is, the one that gets running is the one that goes on the nicest and darkest -_-|`|ENYkIOPDaa	I Kinda have the same problem,<br>  Do you touch your face alot??<br>  If so you may just be taking it off<br>  without reliezing it|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	find a facewash that will make your skin not so oily|`|eOgCCoFoaa	okay i have figured out a solution because i had the same problem<br>  <br>  1) buy sweatproof tinted moisturizer and a makeup sponge.. put it on and then buy some translucent powder that matches your skin and it keeps the creme from getting messed up..<br>  2) mascara/eyeliner don't do both just choose one ... ex. monday eyeliner teusday mascara this way you have less chance of messing them up.. and make sure you get waterproof. yes get liquid eyeliner <br>  3) get creme blush and creme eye shadow this will keep from it smudging!!!!|`|3HFXZ2Oqaa	Try not to touch your face AT ALL.  It promotes oil and can smear make up.  Also, use a primer befor the foundation.  I use mineral foundation form Avon (1/10 dollars or SALE 2/10.) I dont use primer with this kind,and I am fine.  Just use some primer though and never go with liquid foundation.<br>  <br>  FO rthe eyeliner I like liquid and pencil.  Liquid is more dramatic, but I don't think you should use it unless if you apply it correctly and NEVER touch the eye area.  I say that you should buy Avon's Glimmersticks eyeliner- even the NON- waterproof doesn't slide.  It is like pencil liner but retractable (b/c it is in a tube.)<br>  Pencil Liner:<br>  <a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?from=product.aspx&pf_id=30990&from=search&find_spec=eyeliner&camp=200905&dir_delivery=1&rep_delivery=1" rel="nofollow">http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?f...</a><br>  <br>  Liquid Liner (this is the only liquid liner that never smears for me):<br>  <a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?pf_id=31312&from=search&find_spec=eyeliner&camp=200905&dir_delivery=1&rep_delivery=1" rel="nofollow">http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?p...</a><br>  <br>  Foundation (or use primer):<br>  <a href="http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?pf_id=33660&from=search&find_spec=mineral&camp=200905&dir_delivery=1&rep_delivery=1" rel="nofollow">http://shop.avon.com/shop/product.aspx?p...</a>|`|Gk1CO6IQaa	are you in an athletics class? well if you are not than it is probably just randome sweat coming off your body try not to touch your face.<br>  <br>  edit: i try pur minerals makeup it is very good :). i would at least bring the eyeliner and mascara then you should be good. ahh your luckyy i have had acne since 4th grade i didn't even wear makeup wahhh makes me want to cry lol well i hopes this helps :)|`|qIAcMeLgaa	Use a makeup primer. It can be alittle expensive, but you might be able to get it on sale. You put it on before you put all your makeup on, and it helps to hold your makeup in place all day. For the eyeliner, try waterproof.|`|3lXZzK5caa	i ALWAYS use mary kay cosmetics and it is alyways the same before i reomve it than it is when i first put it on before school|`|Q0mcr4HSaa	bring your makeup with you so you can touch it up during the day.|`|V2iRZysgaa	Try shellacking your face with sealant.

FqFPODUmaa	VS has PLENTY of 15-year-appropriate bras! Some neutral colored boring ones, and they also have cute patterned ones that your mom would approve of (no sexy lace) and some of those have push up in them. All a push up bra does, really, is fill some of the space in your bra with padding, essentially making the bra NOT fit you so your boobs come out of the top of the bra more, giving you cleavage. I don't know if your mom would be cool with one of these bras, but maybe start by telling her you want to get one of VS's perfumes and take her shopping with you. Then ask if you can pick out a bra, too. They're REALLY expensive, though. But if you get on their mailing list you can get coupon for a free pantie and 10 to 15 bucks off a bra every month or so.<br>  <br>  And push up bras are just as comfortable as a regular bra, as long as you get the right size. VS does bra fittings in their dressing rooms, so you can get a store attendant to measure you if you'd like.<br>  <br>  Good luck, hun!|`|yhkEyVXLaa	You can always show your mom the kind you want and see what she says.  <br>  Intimissimi is a good quality brand that is definitely comfortable.  If she doesn't think you are ready to wear a bra from Victoria's Secret, you can always try the Pink store (and yes, I do know they are both the same company, Pink just happens to be more fit for younger crowd, so it may be more appropriate for your age.) <br>  You can always say it's just to make yourself feel better or prettier, but you have to mean it, and not say it just to get it to grab attention.  <br>  But it is a good brand, so I would recommend it.<br>  <br>  Added Note:  Since you mean the gel inserts, all you do is put them inside the bra where there is a separation in the cloth.  I don't personally know if they are comfortable or not, but I have heard people saying that they feel like they are part of the bra when they put them in.  But that is also with an intimissimi bra or another VS one.  They are used for extra push up.|`|dFGXCh7vaa	i love those. i'm 13 and i wear them.<br>  it's a bra, all girls wear them. if you're<br>  too shy, go to victorias seret with saved<br>  money. you can go to retailmenot.com and<br>  search victorias secret.com and they usually have<br>  like $10 off bra and free panty or 20% off. just ask. the<br>  only thing she can say is no. tell heer why, too. like<br>  youre persuading her.|`|jIeupHgJaa	the what? intimissimi? Sorry, I've never heard of it before. But since you said "push up", I'm assuming you mean bra.

oOzNMiKtaa	No, but what can cause them is rubbing under your eyes when taking make up off. You could burst your blood vessels under your eyes and it will cause pooling of the blood. So be VERY gentle around your eyes!|`|2bf0afb576f3b1843272a3d582d8496eaa	Well, you can get them from mascara rubbing off but that's obvious.  You can get dark circles under your eyes from allergies and that can come from makeup.  Generally, no, you can't get dark circles because of makeup.<br>  <br>  Dark circles come from such things as  lack of sleep, poor nutrition, poor general health, muscle fatique or pain, and they can be genetic - if your parents have dark circles you can get them.|`|ITJtxINpaa	No. Dark circles are actually caused by eye stress (happens when you watch too much tv, go on computer alot, etc).|`|tm0rUy8raa	If your purposely create them with the makeup,yes.|`|s0VqdZsxaa	no, but you can get wrinkles if you don't wash it off.|`|AA10349362	not that i know of.|`|EdWrs8ptaa	Not to my knowledge you cant, their usually caused by lack of sleep, poor diet or even hereditery..|`|4ma0ZaTkaa	only with like cheep knock-off makeup
EXpaRBsyaa	Depending on your budget, here are some suggestions:<br>  Under $500.00...buy used as you will get a lot more for your money as compared to new at this price range.  Bernina, Brother, Babylock, Elna, and Janome are some of the best machines at any price range and you can pick up used ones for under $500.00.<br>  $500.00 to $1500.00...Babylock and Brother.<br>  $1600.00 and up...Bernina and Husqvarna (Viking) are the best, with Babylock a close runner-up.<br>  Sewing machines can run into $5000.00 and up if you want all the bells and whistles, including embroidery functions.<br>  Stay away from the new Singers as they are NOT what they used to be in years past.  Singer sold out to Merritt a number of years ago, and the new machines are seriously not worth buying.  You will also note that I don't recommend buying a machine at fabric stores or discount houses as they aren't worth considering.  I am assuming that you want something that will last you a while and not require constant adjustments or servicing.  <br>  Above all, sew with the machine before you buy it, bring your own fabric to the store to check it out as sewing machine stores usually have only easy to sew fabrics that make the stitches look good.  You should stay away from stores that don't let you try the machine before you buy it, or only let you use their fabrics.|`|pJ7icz0taa	I bought someone a SINGER for Xmas and they love it.  <br>  Singer has a good reputation from many years ago.

Also, it is used for temporary tattoos.<br>  <br>  Here are some links so you can read up. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|HQmAP5EVaa	Henna is a type of hair color.<br>  It is mainly used in red 'box colors' you can purchase at the store.<br>  I'd stay away from it as much as possible considering it can be harmful for your hair. Sometimes it can cause breakage and damage, especially if after you use it you use a different type of color to do your hair next time.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to get your hair professionally done.|`|0zSWI49Caa	Henna Dye means temporary dye i think and is washable out. <br>  <br>  Think of Henna tatoos, they are temporary tatoos and are easily washable and last for only a few weeks.<br>  <br>  so maybe henna dye = a dye which stays in for a few days, but is washable out.|`|tq4UtRATaa	Henna creates a natural color ranging from orange to brown depending on the mix you use. There are many henna products in stores or online but make sure you use the natural henna for your hair.

d3N60SuSaa	You can't get rid of split ends, you must cut them in order to maintain the health of your hair.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	There is no such treatment or 'homemade' recipe. The only products that say they get rid of them, actually stick them backtogether, It doesn't get rid of them, and You WILL get breakage(as split ends cause breakage,). So the only thing you can do is a Trim, and keep getting a trim every 4-6 weeks, to prevent them,|`|0xgVNOsaaa	once yu have split ends im pretty sure they are there for good. but if yu r dead set against cutting it wrap your hair up and hide the ends like in a bun or something that way the wind or sun or whatever cant get to them. i think the best thing yu could do for your hair, especially so that your split ends wont go through the whole strand of hair is to trim them off. or you could just cut them youself. its really tedious but it gets the job done and your hair looks better.|`|Rkvdszcqaa	now that there split, its gonna be hard to get them back to normal. well to prevent it from getting worse you can use the shampoo that heals damaging hair... and you will see some improvement. and on days you dont need to dont straighten your hair becasue thats what prbly started it in the first place.<br>  <a href="http://www.glimpse.com/beauty/detail-garnier-fructis-fortifying-shampoo-dry-or-damaged-hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.glimpse.com/beauty/detail-gar...</a> <br>  go to this website. they have products that help damaged hair. the one that says helps reverse signs of damage in 1 week actually works.. you can feel your hair is much softer.<br>  hope i helped.|`|4yFDVPhQaa	You can't get rid of them but there is a serum form bed head that kind of fuses them until you get to the saloon.|`|HQmAP5EVaa	There is no way of gettting rid of them without a trim.. sorry.|`|Kg1tHLi2aa	you can't...unfortunately you would need to just get a trim<br>  however, you could use a hair clay, conditioner, or any leave-in treatments to help with dry hair or anything like that to prevent further split ends. you could find these at any drug/convenience store. hope this helps!

OHs8yJiOaa	It would depend to a good degree on particular models and an individual's particular needs/uses.<br>  <br>  Under different circumstances, I'd easily take a particular choice from one over a particular model from the other.<br>  <br>  Kaenon makes some nice lenses (that are more scratch-proof than most of Oakley's, too), but they don't have quite the selection or experience of Oakley. I'm personally not quite into some of the trendier low-end models at Oakley, so would probably pick a couple Kaenon models over most of those for daily wear. I think I'd almost certainly take Oakley's sports models or higher-end models over most or all of Kaenon's offerings, however. I also probably like most of Oakley's designs overall, while most Kaenons don't really "speak to me" as much.<br>  <br>  Kaenon does seem to have an appeal for some watersports (sailing, fishing) and at least gets marketed to areas like NASCAR and golfing more than usual. If I had those particular uses, I might be more likely to look into them. I expect their designs more likely to have an older appeal, as well, while some Oakleys seem more geared to a younger market. I'd be more likely to buy Kaenon as a gift for a parent, for example.<br>  <br>  Anyway, for daily casual wear, at least a couple Kaenons are likely better choices than lower-end Oakleys, but if someone handed me a lump sum and said to go shopping for something--especially for specific use like athletics--I expect I'd come up with a pair from Oakley. <br>  <br>  For style, I suppose a lot could even come down to outright trying things on from both and just seeing what specific model works best for me as an individual....

Ue56xZ7vaa	well this is how i do my make-up, and personally i think my makeup looks really good.<br>  <br>  first of all, i start off with black eyeliner. i line the bottom of my eye, and then run your finger across the eyeliner you just applyed, it keeps it from running under your eyes later. then i put a thin coat on top of my eyelids, right on top of my eyelashes, then smear that one.<br>  <br>  then i apply eyeshadow. i usually use shiny white/translucent or pink and blue ["cotton candy"] <br>  for the cotton candy eyeshadow: get 2 good eyeshadows that are a deep pink and a blue one. put the pink on first, then put blue on top of it. [not right ON TOP of the pink, ABOVE the pink] then gently blend. <br>  <br>  then i put mascara on. i find it's easy to apply if you hold the brush under your eyelashes and blink alot while your applying it. then wait a minute or so, then apply another coat if needed. then continue doing that.<br>  <br>  for this stuff to look good, you need to practice, and her makeup skills will get better as she does this more.<br>  <br>  if you want hair tips, email me. i don't have time to write it all right now, esp. if your not even reading this! D:|`|oCovgwwNaa	Apply foundation to your cheeks, forehead, and chin using a foundation brush, sponge, or clean fingertips. Blend the foundation all the way to your natural hairline with long, light strokes.<br>  <br>  Continue blending over the jawline and onto your neck to achieve a natural, seamless look. Check your face and neck in natural light to make sure the foundation is completely blended in all areas.<br>  <br>  If under-eye circles or red spots remain, do not add more foundation; it can look heavy and cakey. Instead, try a concealer. <br>  <br>  <br>  Concealer is more dense than foundation, allowing fuller coverage of trouble spots and hyperpigmentation (red areas). It can be used over foundation or on it own, and has greater staying power. Remember, a little goes a long way! <br>  <br>  Since the skin under your eyes is more transparent, it tends to look dark, especially at the inner corner near the bridge of the nose. To even out the tone, concealer is a must. Using liquid concealer, gently pat over dark under-eye circles (don't sweep it across the entire area), then blend with your ring finger.<br>  <br>  To cover trouble spots and imperfections, apply a thicker cream concealer onto the blemish or flaw. Then lightly press with a makeup sponge. <br>  <br>  Choose the shade of your concealer carefully. When testing out shades, pick one that matches your skin tone or one shade lighter. It helps to use a mirror outdoors to see how shades look on your skin in natural light.<br>  <br>  Prepare your skin with a light SPF moisturizer before applying concealer for a smoother application. <br>  <br>  <br>  When applying blush, you want the color to look soft and natural, as if it comes from within.  <br>  <br>  Tap or lightly blow on the applicator brush to remove any excess blush before applying to prevent a harsh and uneven application.<br>  <br>  Apply your blush on the apple of the cheek and carefully blend towards your natural hairline.<br>  <br>  If you have two shades, apply the darker one on the apple of the cheek first, then use the lighter shade to highlight. Blend well so there is no visible line between colors.<br>  <br>  Highlight your temples, forehead and chin.<br>  <br>  Cheek color should be used to enhance your complexion, not to change your natural skin tone. Use sparingly for daytime, then add more or a deeper shade for a more dramatic nighttime effect. For special occasions, dust a lightly frosted powder over your cheekbones for a subtle but alluring glow. <br>  <br>  To know "where to glow" bend over for 30 seconds, then slowly stand up. Where your cheeks are flushed is where you are meant to blush. Apply your blush there and it will be naturally rosy every time. <br>  <br>  <br>  For a natural-looking eyeliner and the illusion of lusher, fuller lashes, use a dark brown eye pencil and carefully press a series<br>  of dots between your lashes following your lash line. <br>  <br>  For the sophisticated look, draw a smooth fine line alone the top lashes. <br>  <br>  To create the dramatic look, draw a line inside your lash line (as close to the lashes as possible), then along the top of the lash line.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped. x|`|kknSPYxKaa	FOUNDATION:<br>  -If you want your foundation to look sheer, apply it with a sponge. For more coverage apply it with your fingertips. Professional makeup artists prefer using a makeup brush as this will apply and blend the foundation beautifully.<br>  -Open your mouth when applying foundation, it will help it look more natural.<br>  <br>  MASCARA:<br>  -To get more product on the mascara brush try twirling the brush. Pumping it will cause the product to dry out sooner.<br>  -Always use less mascara on your lower lashes.<br>  -To get smudge free mascara on the bottom lashes, try putting a business card below your lashes, and have your lashes setting on top. Then apply the mascara, let it dry, and you won't have any on your face.<br>  -If your mascara thickens when it reaches the end of tube, place the tube in warm water. This will help to make mascara thinner. Never add water to the tube; bacteria can form. <br>  <br>  BLUSH:<br>  - Put your two fingers (pointer and middle) about right under your eye, they should be pointing to your nose, and your hand should be near your ear.  Apply the blush below that line, it will look flawless :)<br>  <br>  YOU CAN FIND MORE TIPS ON THE WEBSITE I HAVE LISTED BELOW.|`|aiYPHUEWaa	always apply a light-weight moisturizer first<br>  use a concealer on spots and pimples, so the makeup sticks<br>  use mouthwash to take off smeared mascara (yes, it stings a little, but you don't have to scrub at it until your skin is raw...and you'll have that minty-fresh smell!)<br>  get a book such as The Beauty Buyble to recommend beauty products - so many of them are packaged crap|`|bssLQp5laa	i think the best one i got is to apply powder foundation under your eyes before you apply eyeshadow <br>  when applying it specks of it tend to fall down and make  you look like you have dark circles applying that will help <br>  <br>  PLUS putting it on your eyelids makes eyeshadow stay on longer and color will appear better because the oil on lids is observed<br>     <br>  <br>  oh curling eyelashes before applying mascara is a lot better than doing it after wards  if you don't it makes eyelashes brittle and can come off easier and if your using an eyelash curler its best if you get on that heats up but if you cant find one blow dry it and then curl your eyelashes this makes the curl stay on longer .<br>   <br>  also if your using liquid foundation  always apply powder foundation after wards.  it just helps skin better<br>  <br>  hope i helped =]|`|2bBB5AATaa	well i myself learned frum watching. mayby thats what you sister might want to do. i put out videos often on youtube about makeup. mayby your sister might want to check me out. plus if she subscribes to me evrytime i feauture a new look shed be the 1st to know heres my link if u want to check that out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/misstyniecolors" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/misstyniecol...</a>|`|0cJjyogqaa	try natural makeup for beginner, natural makeup is the safety way if we are doesn't have any experience about makeup..|`|3lXZzK5caa	all of these are good tips!!!!!|`|9yMRbtK5aa	.if you put on eyeliner on your top lids, spread the lid out so that you can get a precise line. <br>  .always try to put on eyeliner along the bottom lashline, not the inside, because it can cause eye damage.

FkunZ9q4aa	I always heard the more fatty parts like arms and legs hurt less than bony parts like shoulders and spin.  But, my tattoo on my arm hurt WAY more than either of my shoulders!

I have a piece on my upper back, that stretches from my left shoulder across to my right. It was actually my most painful piece yet, but it's bare able. I thought the area on my spine was going to hurt like crazy and it was actually the least painful spot. Up towards the top of my shoulders was the more painful of the areas. Like I said it varies with everyone, so you are going to hear that it hurts more on bone, but honestly for me it's the opposite it hurts more on the more fleshy areas. You will just have to get the tattoo and see for yourself how painful it really is. good luck|`|RMqyXQYpaa	from different people:<br>  <br>  - There is no doubt that the genitals are the most painful location for a tattoo.<br>  <br>  - Only got one on my upper chest at the moment, but I hear it's one of the worst places.<br>  <br>  - some say lower back and ankle, top of the foot, <br>  <br>  - Anyplace where the skin is thin, there isn't much muscle or fat, and right over a bone, that's where it sucks.<br>  <br>  - I've heard the worst pain is when you get one on your ***, inside of your elbow, or across/up your rib cage.<br>  <br>  -I dated this girl a few years back, and I went with her when she got a tat that went across the back of her neck.

ZtquIhr5aa	People with light skin and eyes are more likely to have freckles because they have less melanin, a chemical in the skin that protects it from sun damage by reflecting and absorbing ultraviolet (UV) rays. Instead of tanning, they freckle.<br>  <br>  Some people's freckles fade away almost completely in the winter, just to return in the summer. People who freckle are often more likely to get sunburns. It is important for everyone (freckled or not!) to wear sunscreen while outside to protect against skin damage and skin cancer.|`|pwC0bEmHaa	if you are asian also if your skin is white you will get freckles i am also an asian i also have freckles because of i am fair.|`|8OzYWDUeaa	It's just genetics. People are not made to exactly resemble their parents. <br>  You most likely received the recessive gene that causes freckles in Asians, which would be why it is not common but it does happen. <br>  <br>  Don't fret about it, just make sure to use facial moisturizer with SPF 15 everyday.

Not sure.  Drink plenty of water during the day, a glass full at night before going to bed (when you are dehydrated they shrivel), wear chaptstick at night, and use your toothbrush to exfoliate in the morning.  That will make them a little fuller. Naturally. <br>  I also heard that if you put a finger against your top/bottom lip (across where the tip of your finger is on one end and then curve it under your lip and you lightly put pressure up to your lip while you push your lip muscles down against your finger (like resisting it) it will cause some increase in size.  Do it like 3 repititions of 10 seconds. <br>  Can't hurt to try.

v0KLvjqMaa	if ur asking how old u need to be it is obvious ur not 18 yet, so ur going to need parental consent, and a guardian to go with you, and most places do walkins but you should at least call in advance, to either schedule something, or have them answer these questions.|`|gy7m1D1Taa	It doesnt hurt as much as it starts to get annoying feeling. ive had mine done a couple times and its kinda hard to take care off, i ended up taking mine out after a couple of months cause it endede up getting infected again. and that wasnt the first piercing ive had, so it wasnt like i couldnt take care of them . i had had my eye brow for 5 years , tongue for 4, industrial for about 3.. but i ended up taking all of them out except my industrial. most places do walk ins. and u usually have to be 18 with an ID if you dont have a parents permission. if you do have a parents permission. you have to be 16, and have the parents present, and sometimes you have to get it notified. goood luck.|`|DVXypPKgaa	ah please dont get a lip piercing they look so sick, girl or guy, and if your a guy most girls dont like them|`|wlB0kTjdaa	I got mine done last year.

I dyed mine alot and it takes, like, almost two hours to dry.
oPnfdTWuaa	If you pick the spot then you are stopping the healing process. Although it will make it smaller temporarily, it is damaging your skin and and leaving the scar. You should consult a GP and he may refer you to a specialist at a hospital.

Curles are very in aswell.. just find your style.. and funky it up.. have fun.. and look cool this season.. all my love and good wishes ;)|`|qH7BJjTsaa	i don't know i'am not changing my hair color so i'am don't know  sorry|`|WZlKy4Vgaa	I'd say a few of these...    . Messy hair is a look in this year so put some curls in your hair and waves and then put your fringe back put put it coming down the side a little bit. it makes your hair look a lot thicker and is a really nice look.  . Lots of layers, very short layers with long hair are very 'in' at the moment, a lot of people have it at my school but make sure that your hair isn't really thick with this look because it won't look right.  . Those headbands that go all the way around your head... wear one of these but have the front coming onto your forehead with messy or curly hair, me and my friends do this and it looks nice for school or even going out.  . A high quiff like the ones on our avatars but have this with a side ponytail and curled.    See which one suits you best and go with it :)      Hope I Helped  & Good luck :)

It all depends on if you stretched properly, how much scar tissue you have, your body and how old you are (the older you are, the less likely they will shrink)    Stretching should be considered permanent. There is no way to say for sure if your lobes will shrink at all. Never stretch larger than you are willing to live with.|`|31b574dfeeb648b4c51a2adc44c50c74aa	After 5/8ths they will never go back to normal.  Though they will close or shrink up a bit but you'll forever have odd holes in your ears.  If your at a 0 now, you can go to a 00 if you want them bigger.  My boyfriends ears are currently 52mm... once you hit an inch you start going mm's to buy earings.|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	I guess 20 feet good luck with that
nidCgr73aa	I'm fourteen (turned fourteen in January) I recommend Delirium by Mango (the clothes shop) it's available in the shop or online.<br>  <br>  For after PE I use the yellow Impulse body spray I think it's called Blossom. Do not use it as deodorant though.<br>  <br>  Another nice one is a Hannah Montana brand perfume, sounds childish but have a lovely smell.<br>  <br>  My two other favorites are LA Style (the blue one) by Mary-Kate And Ashley great if you like mutsy-ier perfume and the blue bottle one by Morgan De Toi it's a great citrus-y one.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|s1ePCpOeaa	" georgio " is my fave!, and nother nice fruity smell is " so kiss me "|`|iMaYLGECaa	I really like Black XS by Paco Rabanne it kind of smells like bubble bath but it's subtle|`|0G1fOjpWaa	if you like fruity smells then any of the escada perfumes should suit you perfectly....|`|94M1QQ8paa	im almost fourteen too!

vuDE5TPbaa	Well with stuff like skin care, you wont need to recontact the person overseas for maintenance right? So there is no issue regarding follow-up. The only stress I see is that you have to pay extra to get it from overseas. Why not find somewhere local? Plus you buying something outside of the country doesn't help OUR economy, just THEIRS.     But if you are ok with spending some extra dough on this product, go for it!
nJtJvL7Naa	You have to rub really hard, and for a long time.  My mom used it on one leg, from the knee down, and it took like 15 minutes. So not worth it!|`|cSgztJSZaa	i just got it and i loved it,  you cant just rub it, apple a loittle pressure and do it in a circle 3 times, then do it in the same spot, but do it backwords for 3 times again, i did it to my bf yesterday :)

If the answer is no...then personal hygeine isn't an issue! Go crazy with  it!! Forget about showering. DO NOT trim your toenails!! Heck yeah, have a blast!!|`|bs9Zbouaaa	lol.

I only enter comps on the companies official websites, so my details aren't shared around.|`|GM3zog4Jaa	Never ever give your MOBILE number, they might send you advert texts & will charge you loads of money (like 5 a text).  As for your home number, some of them do but if it's a competition, they might only use it to contact you if you have won, But still, don't risk it.  I always give a fake phone number or say I haven't got a number.  Beware of anything that is too good to be true.|`|DoO04zsqaa	noo but i'd loveee to :- )

AA11311675	Yep, you need spray to make the poof hold, you can find a couple of useful teasing tutorials here <a href="http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=sh0rtiiet0ocute&view=videos" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/profile?user=sh0r...</a><br>  <br>  the front poof tutotrial is the 4th one<br>  <br>  hope i helped! :)|`|0xgVNOsaaa	ok for teasing yu dont NEED hairspray, if yu have good hair like thick and stuff it stays really well but when yu got thin hair,such as myself or yu then yes hairspray is essential lol<br>  *the pouf is a little tricky with thin hair huh? <br>  *yu gotta take the part yu want to puff up and loop it back to your head if yu hairspray it then that might help a little, but after yu flip it try to get it to stay in a pouf for a second then use the bobby pins or watever and then go crazy mad with spray, but dont spray to close, then that makes it clump and wat not lol  =]|`|Y0WSB4C2aa	you don't need hairspray to do the tease but it helps alot to hold.<br>  <br>  <br>  to do a poof:<br>  take the "bangs" of your hair<br>  gather them all and pinch them togehter<br>  hold it against your scalp CLOSER<br>  to your hairline then it usually falls and<br>  take bobby pins and pin it down.<br>  it may take sometimes up to like 5 or 6<br>  then if needed, use hairspray to ensure<br>  it will hold its shape.<br>  <br>  <br>  hope i helped :)|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	Yes if you want to tease your hair and make it stay teased for a while, then i would definitely recommend using hair spray. otherwise your hair will deflate in a few minutes. <br>  <br>  poof thing on front of your hair? ehh..i really don't know what you are talking about...<br>  <br>  here's one video i just found about how to tease hair [if you dont know]<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDB8GTGYBwc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDB8GTGYB...</a><br>  <br>  just type "tease hair" on youtube and you'll find a ton of videos that show you how to, better than i could tell you (:|`|I0JBGllLaa	just use hairspray. spray it a little bit and carefully tease it.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	hairspray|`|Hf6RjsTZaa	no, you do not always need hairspray to tease your hair. its just alot of back combing, but it helps!<br>  <br>  make sure you use a good brush to back comb with, i find that the standard 3-row styling brushes (availiable at local beauty supply store) work best. <br>  <br>  to make the popular 'bump' that is quite stylish, this is how i do it-<br>  <br>  take a square section on the top of your head from the front hairline to <br>  about halfway back, and as wide as your eyebrows.<br>  <br>  take sections about 1/4 inch, and back comb them. Then you smooth  them back.<br>  <br>  it helps if you take the back and push it to the front to make it pouf more, secure with bobby pins :)<br>  <br>  i hope you understood how to do that, if not- check you tube.<br>  <br>  <br>  you can always get a 'bump-it' too ;) ---><br>  <br>  <a href="https://www.bumpits.com" rel="nofollow">https://www.bumpits.com</a>|`|GhFwXbI4aa	well yer u do need it hairpsray to keep it up

kSHQkja1aa	The 3rd one is the best...it is very elegant and classy.<br>  <br>  To me, the second one is to flashy, the color too bright.

AA11101361	It's the ones with aluminum. which includes, roll-ons, solids and sprays that are linked to cancer and Alzheimer's.  There's no definitive link.  Either way, Aluminum acts as an antiperspirant by clogging pores which can lead to ingrown hairs and irritated follicles.  I have no problem with a little sweat, my problem is being stinky, so I use natural deoderants.  To be on the safe side, you could use deodorants from Nature's Gate, Tom's of Maine and Weleda.|`|jXvJDDgTaa	i think no difference but what i know is that the deodrant that clooses the pores of the skin to stop the penetration of the sweat is the one that causes cancer but the other deodrant that allows the access of the sweat but it covers it smell with a good one is the one that does not cause cancer|`|0cJjyogqaa	Most deodorants contain aluminium salts, because the metal is effective at stopping skin sweating. Tests found that women who used deodorants had deposits of aluminium in their outer breasts.|`|LxcYzV7iaa	they dont neccessarily cause cancer but its the spayons becaause they contain aluminum|`|Ppz64oxQaa	Both.  You're going to DIE!

RChBFKdWaa	I think blonde hair looks best on people that don't have a tan or fake tan, but arent super pale, and also it looks good on people with a pinkish skin tone :B|`|adyNCp6eaa	If you have pale skin then blonde would work fine. Blonde hair would not suit like dark-skinned complexions, or any complexion that has a high contrast to the bright blonde color. The worst look is when a girl has bleach blonde hair and gets a dark tan, that just screams "PREP!"|`|4Xmr0Yjlaa	if your hair is brown i think that it would be gorgeous becasue my hair was brown so i died it blonded and it looks amazing so if u die it blonde i hope it looks amazing alson     Good luck,:D|`|uD1UFdRsaa	I agree with the cat person, if you have dark eyebrows I think you would want to bleach them too or it will look to odd.     I think it should suit you fine - but a picture would help.|`|9dr0BZIbaa	Generally, people who are a few shades away from their desired shade (i.e. going from light brown to blonde, and vice versa) should have a natural look.   Pale and beige complexions tend to go along well with lighter hair so you should be fine.  It's the darker complexions, such as tan, bronze, and dark, that look unnatural.|`|OeALoYSHaa	ur eyebrow! if their too dark u will look like a skunk plus if ur very pale it will strip all the color from u and end up looking sick.|`|SqdPVCPiaa	Don't, please. It will turn yellow.   My friend has mousy brown hair and dyed her hair blonde. It turned so yellow, she went home, then turned straight back to the beauty salon to get it RE-dyed brown. Get highlights instead.  Blonde hair doe not suit olive, asian, oriental, or black skin tones. Light tan and pale it looks good on.|`|7444d1f6013b3210f0b177184ae84bcbaa	depends,if youve got brown eyebrows it might look a bit weird.|`|KvZutMEZaa	I think yes for pale skins, but if you are paper white, then maybe not.|`|v1uNUcwCaa	blonde suits anyone if you get the right shade for your skin tone.|`|ndwmn6Z4aa	I'VE GOT GREEN EYES AND BLONDE HAIR AND PALE SKIN AND PPL SAY IT LOOKS NICE BUT IF U HAVE REALLY PALE SKIN THEN DONT DYE YOUR HAIR CUZ IT TENDS TO LOOK LIKE A ZOMBIE|`|I2ke8yj7aa	i think it would look good you would just need a little blush or foundation cause i have dirty blonde hair and all that which is kinda what ur looking for|`|M5BKd6PGaa	Green eyes  white -pinkish tone, fair to light.skin tone. and light brown i pluck brows .My hair color naturally auburn brown, I dye my hair golden or a warm blonde. Comes out with a strawberry blonde tint, and I love it. Your complexion sounds perfect.!!  How many natural blondes do you see  with olive skin and big brown eye brows?? not Natural..then you see that look not attractive,    green eyes and blonde's go perfect.   Good Luck!!
QwuIGBgeaa	Volumizing shampoo and conditioner (go easy with the conditioner as it weighs down your hair)<br>  <br>  Also you can use a root lifter, which will give you incredible volume. Blowdrying your hair upside down can give it an extra boost too.|`|DpWLcKdxaa	here are some tips :)<br>  you can :<br>  - blow dry it upside down<br>  - blow dry it with the nozzle pointing up twards your roots, instead of down twards your feet <br>  -take a comb, and backcomb your hair from the middle of that piece of hair to the root. its called teasing your hair, so you can look up more detailed explanations :) word of warning ! : teasing does crete friz, so i would suggest teasing the layers under your hair so that the top layers rest on the teased part and give it a full look :)<br>  - use gel and hairspray after blow drying/teasing/showering to keep body<br>  - during the day when there aren't any hair product to use, flip your head to your knees, and flip your hair up and down five times<br>   ** also remeber that conditioner only adds flatness to your hair, so use little - if any - conditioner while in the shower<br>  - dont wash your hair everyday : its unhealthy, damages ends, and decreases fullness :(<br>  - use mouse when scruncing your hair, it helps alot !<br>  <br>  hope this helpss :)|`|TbYVRiqVaa	omg i have rlyyy thin hair and i just take a shower then i put this herbal escences in it (makes it smell good) and then you scrunch it and it looks curly and has volume half wet/half dry and a guy asked me out when i did tht.. ;]|`|TbqxlNbuaa	blow dry it while yur head is upsidedown but turn it around if needed.<br>  straighten hair if not.<br>  teasee it and hairspray it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lCCR32wj4&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_lCCR32w...</a>|`|Y0WSB4C2aa	blow dry your hair UPSIDE DOWN to add volume.<br>  also, lift up sections of your hair and apply hairspray<br>  <br>  try that out! good luck :)!|`|TIWYBoSFaa	use Tresemme 24 hour volume it really works|`|OaP5Zaaeaa	i agree with people.

AA11311675	Dont worry! I once spilled nail polish on a dress, and i followed this instructions:<br>  <br>  1 Test a small, hidden area of the fabric to ensure it is color fast. <br>  <br>  2 Saturate the polish with bug spray (I use Deep Woods Off, but anything similar will work). <br>  <br>  3 Gently work the spray into the fabric using a soft toothbrush or a rag, using more bug spray as necessary. The paint base will begin to “gum” up into clumps. Keep working bug spray into the stain until all the paint is gone. Rinse well with water. <br>  <br>  4Apply stain remover to the remaining stain, as the bug spray may only remove the paint base, not the color. Work the stain remover into the stain until all the color is gone. <br>  <br>  5Wash item separately to prevent the transfer of bug spray to other clothing.|`|evEJxv06aa	don't worry here is a website that will help you get the stain off it ok its called how to get rid of stuff.com|`|st5reHVjaa	it probably wont come out.<br>  try to soak it in cold water after u get the excess out w/ papertowl.<br>  wash in the washing machine with zout.<br>  other then that. idk. sry.<br>  maybe do extra chores to get the money if it doesnt come out.|`|EnYLhQajaa	Try soaking it in nail polish remover.

bf3ee8e740da5b4ef76fa104d1e49f7eaa	A lot of things are caused by the balance within the body itself. Yest can be a major cause of acne. Hormone imbalance, to much sugar...etc.Cutting down on sugar and yeast intake will help. Steaming your face to open pores will also help. <br>  <br>  As far as steaming goes...You boil water ...get a towel place it over your head and then place your face over the pot... <br>  <br>  You can also use tea tree oil as a natural disinfectant. It really helps with acne.|`|RlvZHHu6aa	Have you ever heard YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT?<br>  <br>  It is very true.  The very food that you LOVE eating is the same food that is causing your problems.   Stay away from dairy, heavily saturated foods and milk.   They trigger the mucus and subaceous glands to produce oil and acne.<br>  <br>  Drink plenty of water and eat more fruits and veggies.  I promise you'll see a big difference!|`|M627my7Baa	Have you tried ProActive?? I had a friend in high school who had HORRIBLE acne, who now has great skin. He swears by it. Also, talk to your doctor. I think there are certain pills that may help.<br>  <br>  OH, and little things like making sure your hair is clean and off your face, plus keeping your pillow cases washed, hands off your skin, etc, really work wonders.|`|PxxpIW75aa	See your Dr. It has to be something else rather than Acne for your age.<br>  Have your hormone levels checked out. Good Luck
AA10102048	From an older teenage girl, Please listen to me. Your weight is exactly what it should be at 5 foot. Being 60 pounds and 5 feet is disgusting. I have friends who are battling anerexia and trust me, it is not fun. Love your body the way it is. Beautiful is not showing your ribs. Be healthy, and eat balanced meals!!|`|DeQsKdmSaa	Holy ******* ****.<br>  Do you realize that FOURTH graders weigh 60 pounds? Your current weight is normal. I am your age, your height, and I weigh ten pounds less than you. I run once a day and eat plenty of wheat, but I've always been underweight.<br>  But really. You can't lose that much weight. That's dangerous, and not healthy, that's what we call orthorexic. It's an eating disorder, when one is obsessed with counting calories and burning off weight without throwing up and starving themselves.<br>  <br>  Get some fuckin help.|`|FekuK85raa	You seriously aren't fat!

Most out grow self consciousness by the mid 20's. What this means that your problem is not weight, it's that you are too concerned about what you think others will think of you. <br>  <br>  The best thing is to start reading books about self image psychology. An old stand-by is Psycho Cybernetics by Maxwell Maltz. Should be in any library or you can get it on Amazon for about fifty cents. Everyone should read it at some point in their lives--just skip over the parts that are a bit advanced for you and focus on the stuff he says about self consciousness. <br>  <br>  Take Care,<br>  <br>  Richard|`|xc6iCPUQaa	Ok you have got to be kidding me.

And besides that, if you do go through with your "diet" you will kill yourself.|`|72df64d291deb659fd8f62b0c3330639aa	yeah,... no 13 year old is 60 pounds you freak.
e1434520b7d6b7db2b483084c9ad434aaa	TIPS<br>  *Try to find a stylist who knows how to work with curly hair. You can find reviews by region here: <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a><br>  *Don't shampoo every day.<br>  *Comb conditioner through hair in the shower.<br>  *Apply styling products to dripping wet hair. Scrunch or twirl hair to achieve desired shape.<br>  *Use styling products suited for your hair type. Don’t know yours? <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/hair-types</a><br>  *Avoid terrycloth towels on hair; use linen, paper towels, or t-shirts instead.<br>  *Air dry or use a diffuser with your blowdryer.<br>  *Don't touch (or brush!) your hair while it’s drying.<br>  *Once completely dry scrunch out any crunchy texture.<br>  <br>  For hair type specific products check out these forums:<br>  <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curltalk/</a><br>  There you can find others with the same hair type and try out some of their favorite products. I would recommend something, but I don’t know your hair type. :)<br>  <br>  Lastly, it has made my hair so much better since I started the curly girl method! I used to almost never wear it down (it was a frizz/poof ball), but now I have pretty, shiny curls. ~:) It’s pretty radical—no sulfates (shampoo) or silicones—but it’s so great for curly hair. Give it a shot and check it out:<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-Girl-Method-for-Curly-Hair" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Follow-the-Curly-...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/" rel="nofollow">http://www.ylcf.org/gotcurl/</a> (outdated product recs!)<br>  <br>  Some other great curly care sites: <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/jessicurl</a><br>  <a href="http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm" rel="nofollow">http://livecurlylivefree.com/home.htm</a><br>  <br>  HAIRSTYLES:<br>  - Side parted hair with the front section clipped to the side. I like to use little jaw clips, but bobby pins will work if your hair isn't too thick.<br>  - Flipped through pony tail. Put your hair in a loose pony tail. Reach up under the pony tail and separate the hair there into two sections. Use your other hand to twist the tail and then pull it through from the bottom. <br>  - French ponytail. Put the top section of your hair (above ears) into a ponytail. Next, put the middle into a pony. Then put the bottom into a pony. This looks less kiddy if you do it looser with pretty clips.<br>  -French braid headband. This works for leaving the hair down or up and is quicker than a real one. <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-French-Braid-Headband" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-French-Bra...</a><br>  - Messy bun<br>  <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Messy-Bun" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-Messy-Bun</a><br>  <br>  There's also a book out there with hair styles specifically for curls called "Strictly Curls" by Nicole Siri. <a href="http://www.strictlycurls.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.strictlycurls.com/</a><br>  <br>  HTH! :)|`|AILK0BTiaa	have you tried using chi styling products and using a chi or any good ceramic flat iron"? i think the combo of the products and a good iron will make the difference :o)|`|mPsNadNUaa	heres a tip when i straighten my hair i first straighten one part then i put hairspray on a brush and brush my hair with it then i straighten it again mine stays all day long even into the next day|`|PK9R1V8gaa	use hair spray, a smoothing serum, and a straighening cream when you straighten your hair. or....try smoothing it back into a slick ponytail while its wet and let it air dry.

oxL8MEKPaa	BEST ANSWER-Thats a cute cut-it wont take long to grow out your hair to get it if you do the following....<br>  Wash your hair with a good shampoo and conditioner at least every other day. When you wash your hair massage your scalp with your finger tips(not nails) for a couple of minutes. Use a conditioner. Leave on for a couple of minutes at least. Biolage is a good choice for shampoo & Conditioner. Keep the ends trimmed. (just trim about 1/4 inch every 3 months, no more) This keeps the ends from splitting and breaking off. Be selective on who trims your hair. You only want 1/8-1/4 trimmed every 21/2-3 months. Take a multiple vitamin daily. There are other vitamins you can take for healthy hair like Biotin( a building block in hair), Vit B complex., But ask your mom first if you are under 18.<br>  I also take extra Vit C, E, A and calcium.<br>  Horse shampoo doesn't work. Ive tried it. If you can't afford Biolage, try Pantene.<br>  I grew my hair long fast using these strategies. I am also a professional hairstylist. You don't have to brush it all the time like some suggest. But massage your scalp often. It helps with the blood flow which promotes growth and healthy hair.<br>  <br>  One more thing... There is a lot of products and supplements that offer hair growth etc. None of them work. Just good old fashioned cleansing conditioning, massaging, trimming and vitamins(especially Biotin) really work. Don't waste your other money on products cause they don't work. It's all false advertising.<br>  Also, try to use as little heat as possible on your hair. Let it dry naturally as much as possible. It will keep your hair super shiney and strong. Heat breaks hair down. Another trick is to rinse your hair with cool water after the conditioner. Shiney, shiney, shiney long hair.|`|GO46i2l9aa	No shampoos that I know of. Just get your hair trimmed more often. You don't have to cut off a lot, but keeping it healthy will make it grow quickly.|`|SogS1WzYaa	eat more organic fruits and vegetables- try drinking vemma - <a href="http://myvemma.com/fastenergy" rel="nofollow">http://myvemma.com/fastenergy</a> your body needs nutrients|`|wXCX0Gy7aa	pantene beautiful length and cut the split ends|`|TbYVRiqVaa	cut spilt ends regularly so they dont mess up growth, and wash it regularly.|`|Ch39oU58aa	take vitamins that pregnant women take. your skin and nails will look better too.|`|QRG1Szn6aa	you have to brush it alot <br>  and take vitimen A <br>  it helps alot|`|nIOXmNBfaa	yes... i think its something with pantene...|`|zWo03iLNaa	Eat a lot of protein<br>  Shampoos will not work because hair grows from the inside out.

Let it sit for half an hour, then warm it back up just until it's comfortable, then massage vigorously into scalp and hair. Let it sit for like 15 mins. Wash and condition as usual. Do about every two weeks, it helps hair grow faster, makes it shinier and smells amazing :D|`|aWbMhQvVaa	I have hair this length and I got it fast by one easy thing. My hair grows majorly slow!

RChBFKdWaa	oval shape face can have anything, lucky|`|1o6bzLVbaa	watch this:  http://youtube.com/watch?v=QOAAI3D31KQ|`|OeALoYSHaa	i have the same thing, but brown hair. i would stick with the swoop bangs and simi wavy hair looks best. with make up i guess it depends on ur age and skin type. are u fair skined? dark? 15? or 45? it all depends|`|KvZutMEZaa	HAIR    This is the best face shape you can dream of because it is perfectly  balanced. It isnt a coincidence that many fashion models have this  facial shape.     A lot of different hairstyles look good with an oval face shape. Short,  long and medium haircuts all look good with it; so you are very lucky.  You can wear a bob hairstyle, pixie, layered hairdos, up styles ...  anything you want.     Try to keep your hair away from your face because of the nice shape  it is worth being shown.  A ponytail will look good with this type of face.  Try to avoid heavy fringes.      MAKEUP    Try different browns, especially chocolate tones. Browns and dark greens with copper or gold highlights are also a great choice.    Apricots and taupes are good choices for highlighters.    Dark purples, plums and metallics work too. Coppers and golds will make a really glamorous evening look for makeup tips for green eyes. I personally really like the way deep purples look with dark green eyes.    When you're learning makeup tips for green eyes, it also helps to know what colors you might want to avoid.    First up, blues. Any color of blue doesn't do green eyes justice. I would recommend avoiding light blues, dark blues and even some colors (purples or pinks) with blue undertones.    Pinks are also a hard color to judge. Some can look really, really good and others can look really, really bad. This is usually a matter of trial and error.    Silvers are not a good choice either    For eyeliner - try steely grays or chocolate browns. Use gold or white to open up the eye if your eyes are small.
RChBFKdWaa	it'll probably go really dry and gross, but i guess it'd be good after a while if you use good shampoo and conditioners like biosilk or paul mitchell. and also use redken heavy cream treatment. ^.^|`|ZwRZgJIKaa	yes go for it
D8nyS1Rfaa	Let me answer your question and then correct some of the posters on here.    First, it's good that you started off low and didn't get red.  You never want to get red.  If it's a 20 minute max bed then go up by 2 minutes.  If it's a 15, 12, 10 minute bed then either stay the same or go up by 1 minute.  Do not go up too fast.  For example, go 3 - 4 times a week do 6, 6, 8, 8, 10, 10, etc., etc.      Corrections:    Tanning does not cause skin cancer.  Overexposure and burning causes skin cancer (i.e. sunburns, getting red and then tanning on top of red, getting more red).      Moderate UV exposure will prevent internal cancers, including breast cancer, and is now linked to preventing melanoma.  Your body does not absorb enough Vitamin D through food/supplements.  You need UV exposure (and not just 5 minutes on your arms in the car).    It's true that tanning outside is cheaper, because it's free.  However, the time of day, time of year, cloud cover, are you in water, wearing an SPF are all factors that will increase/decrease your chances of burning.  Indoor exposure is controlled and you can put yourself on a schedule.    Moisturize your skin!|`|jXvJDDgTaa	10 minutes once a week for two months|`|idhcqr5Daa	Tan in your own backyard. It's cheaper. All you need is your tanning lotion, oil, or spray and a beach chair or towel. Position the chair or towel in the yard where the sun will hit you directly.   Wear sunscreen when you tan! If you are just going to sit on the beach and tan for an hour put SPF 30 on. If you don't use sunscreen while tanning, UVA and UVB rays will still harm your skin, even if you don't get burned! If you don't wear sunscreen you'll also get a fake, red-orange tan that NOBODY wants. Unfortunately, you rarely notice it on yourself so keep out an owl eye. Use sunscreen chap stick also. And make sure you apply your sunscreen out of the sun and let it soak in for 20-25 minutes before you go into the sun.   Wear the swimsuit you will wear when you are swimming! It is not classy to have lots of complex tan lines all over your back, screaming "I NEVER WEAR THIS BATHING SUIT- I TAN IN ANOTHER!" That's just fake. Wear the same swimsuit so you have a smooth, buttery tan that flows from skin to bathing suit.   Wear the swimsuit color that brings out your tan. If you have no tan, wear dark greens, blues, and purples to attempt to hide it more. If you have a moderate tan, wear black or white, to accent your tan. If you are exactly where you want to be, and really tan, wear any color you want. You are TAN and nothing will hide it! Show off a bit, you've earned it.   Moisturize. After you've tanned, be sure to moisturize your skin. It will help keep your skin healthy and will prevent it from becoming flaky from the sun.  Consider using self tanner which is safer and gives you a real looking tan. Make sure to find one that does not make you look orange.   If it's your first time going to a tanning booth, don't go for very long; talk to the cashier about the recommended length.   If you stay out in the sun too long, you could be in danger of heatstroke.   Tanning can cause skin cancer, so be careful to regulate how often you tan! Tanning every day isn't good for you! Also, keep track of any moles, and watch for changes in color or shape.   Start with a short time in the sun, say 10 minutes / day for sensitive skin. If you see no problems you can gradually increase your time in the sun. In case of red spots or itching take a few days break from tanning.   Be careful when exposing new areas of skin to direct sunlight.   Sunburns can be anywhere from 1st degree burns to 3rd degree burns. If you get burned very badly, see a doctor immediately!   Extensive tanning/exposure to Ultraviolet (UV) radiation could cause you to get skin cancer, which in its worst form is called Melanoma. (Using a spray tan IS more safe. If you must be colored and don't care if you turn slightly orange, you could save your life.)   Using sun beds, as with all forms of Ultraviolet exposure, can be dangerous. If you can not tan easily because you are naturally pale, do not go to extremes to tan.     x0x0_LEi|`|24ebc8edf978e269550ad9d8827de8dcaa	There is no such thing as a "perfect tan".    Tanning is the body's natural defence to ultra violet light exposure, therefore by definition tanning is harmful to the body or it wouldn't require such a defence.    So a tan can never be "perfect" since nothing harmful can ever be described so.    Your perfect colour however is what you are now, without being tanned.|`|s3FWCRGxaa	i used to go for 10 minutes every other day for 2 weeks or until you get the color your looking for, the just go once every 3 or 4 days to keep it up :)

Ear piercings are fine tho.    Also when you get a job, they may not allow you to work with them bcos of the piercings..    And if your dad gets pissed... I wouldn't risk it.|`|vjmXiIfnaa	Don't do either.    I went piercing crazy from the age of 16-18 and now regret making orifices all over my body.     If I only knew then what I know now:/

BLUUQFG4aa	Try taking a multivitamin and drinking more water!|`|jXvJDDgTaa	well that is because u dont have enouh calcium in ur body    also because u should trim its ends every 6 weeks it makes it grow faster    try these tips    drink milk  eat food rich in vitamin and protein because ur hair is made from 75% proteins so eating more proteins makes it thicker    also wash ur hair with warm water so that u would open the pores to allow more hair to grow    dont wash ur hair every day 4 times a week is enough because using too much shampoo ruins ur hair because it is full of chemicals and because u remove the natural oil in ur hair needed to make it thick    dont take artificial vitamins natural nutration in food is better because too much vitamin can kill i read it in the book|`|xwYUBYmFaa	drink milk and try 2 cut it more so that it grows|`|L1aD8xIzaa	it doesnt grow coz u dont eat healthy and put good shampoo on........
iHna2K7Gaa	Halter tops, by far. Find one with the seam right below the bust (like an empire-waist style) and a V-neck cut. The best are the ones with a crossover V-neck.

Fv9SC6zRaa	no i agree with your parents!<br>  my friends only started getting it done when they were 15!|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You can't.  You can try as hard as you want to to convince your parents, but convincing the law to be bent for you is an entirely different story.  Wait a few years and try again.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	You're 12?<br>  <br>  That's sick. wait 'till you're at least 16 -.- Even then, they look super trashy|`|XADP739faa	seriously, don't get a belly button piercing at your age. You might think that you really want one and you'll never regret it, but you might. You're too young to get one, and you're stomach is basically still growing. Get one when you're in your teenage years at about 16 and above, because then you can nearly make proper descisions for yourseld.|`|99c8b6a561c76a158d8cba66de720caaaa	Nononono. I repeat do NOT get a belly ring. There's no point of one unless you're going to wear a two-piece swimsuit to the beach. Also, you're a wee-bit too young, and it hurts getting one. (:|`|WovH0N48aa	I know I am a boy and a teenager too, but I think you're still too young, wait until you're in High School.|`|7mmmGytpaa	wait till you're at lease 14 or 15. you're very young, why the rush?|`|X05GAaLeaa	I am 15 and I am about to get it done...in a few weeks, You can probably not persuade her to let you get your navel pierced if you had to beg for months to get a second ear piercing , by age 12 i had 6 ear piercings in each ear<br>  Theres no way shes going to say yes<br>  sorry|`|we2Csi51aa	duuuh your eleven...im fourteen and still haent gotten mine done.<br>  my mom got hers done and they did it wrong and now its scarred. dont ruin your beautiful bod with piercings|`|miU0ogXiaa	belly piercings look trashy|`|JOfW3U5taa	ur gonna regret getting that second hole when you're older :)|`|IcAO0QuBaa	Your a lil young to get it pierced.....|`|49GfjLhqaa	why get a belly piercing at 12?|`|L9b7sUbFaa	your 12! <br>  <br>  <br>  slut much?|`|UPfXjUUmaa	Im 19 and i just got mine done for the first time and trust me its not worth it. it hurts like hell. the infections are gross. and its not as attractive as i thought it would be. I did it behind my parents back and once it got infected it was out in the open. so not only did i lose their trust, i ruined my body with this nasty infected scar.|`|IkyEuYiWaa	you cant get it done until your 15.<br>  with your school I.D, and your Birth Certificate...<br>  <br>  cause i had to postpone mine getting done for a week.<br>  so its best to just wait. and it gets infected really really easily.<br>  so i would just wait, and plus 12 is WAY too young to get it done.|`|n8xGORo9aa	go for it,its cute,and if u got a nice tummy,why not!!!plus you will be more aware of your tummy and you will want to keep your tummy in shape to show off your cool belly ring!
OaP5Zaaeaa	okay here's what you do. first try lemon juice. and see if it werks.<br>  <br>  and get St ives apricot scrub, if you have gentle skin get the gentle one.<br>  <br>  i use avon banishing cream fer my marks.<br>  <br>  but before i go to sleep i put on the cocoa butter in the stick and rub it around your face and then get  a BIG glass of water and drink it before you go to sleep.<br>  <br>  IT WORKS. you dont have to cut out all junk food just drink ALOT of water, you'll MUCH healithier but you'll have to go to the bathroom frequently!|`|0AQF8pnKaa	stop eating greasy food and wash your face three times a day.<br>  once in the morning, after school/work, and before you go to bed. also wear a light lotion and exfoliate your face three times a week.|`|AA11021888	try cutting down on the fatty foods.<br>  Wash your hands a lot and try not to touch your face because that causes oils from your hands to go on your face. <br>  Wash your face 2 times a day. Once in the morning and once in the evening. Try not to over wash your face because that causes excess oil production. <br>  Do not pop your pimples.<br>  put your hair in ponytails or get rid of front bangs because they cause oil on the hairline.<br>  Use a mouisurizer daily and exfoliate weekly.|`|oA066Stbaa	eat more veggies & healthly stuff and less greasy and junk food. wash your face 2-3 times a day with a cleanser, like neutrogeno oil-free acne wash works amazing or clean&clear. first wash your face, then apply toner then put on moisturizer with SPF. do this 2-3 times a day. masksare good too every once in a while.
sbbF6T9raa	if you paint your nails to often it can be bad, because you aren't letting them breath. if you do this for too long eventually they will turn a shade of yellow. you can make your nails stronger by buying a special kind of base coat that still lets your nails breath. and don't bite your nails.|`|kuTVtTFUaa	i paint my nails ever other day or once a week <br>  usually i use a nail hardener or a clear coat first then i put on the color i want to use so that way the color doesnt stain my nails and mke it turn yellow or what ever|`|m2eHPeciaa	take Vitamin E to make nails stronger as well as ur hair shinier and ur skin clearer. painting nails doesn't harm them, but over time they will get yellow if u used dark colors. if that happens, jus use a buffer to buff off the top of the nail bed. u should be okay|`|Cw6jp5sFaa	it is not bad to paint ur nails but if u leave it on to long then it will turn ur nailbed yellow|`|3lXZzK5caa	i dont think so what is bad is when you get acrilic nails
gy7m1D1Taa	I've redone my eyebrow and lip a couple of times, and its not the best idea. but then again i know some friends of mine that have done all of their own peircings. if your got the right tools and have done your research on how to do it the proper way , then do what youve gotta do. always make yourself a clamp. that makes it easier and a little less painfull.|`|oQDQSSSDaa	You want to pierce your own ear? Seriously, go see a professional. They wouldn't make it painful at all. You could scar yourself if you do it by yourself. Don't do it, I've got my tragus pierced and thats by a professional piercer.|`|yPsANmUvaa	i personal will never get that priced but a lot of my friends have and they say it never feels so just be careful.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	You're not a professional, so don't try it.  It's going to be extremely painful because you do not know what you are doing and, more than likely, are  not using the correct tools.  Wait until you're out of mommy's house and not relying on her to feed and clothe you, and THAN and only than go get holes shoved through your face.|`|URLq6zIDaa	just go get it done.. its seriously like 25 bucks. the tragus is really difficult to do yourself because you need to hold something behind your tragus so you do not puncture more than necessary. just go get it done.
EcY6Fwgkaa	Do it! It doesn't hurt a bit, your ear just gets hot after and turns a little red. It will hurt to sleep on that side for a little while but its manageable and goes away quickly if you take care of it. My biggest problems were when people hugged me their head pushed on my ear and some peeling skin. But I stopped using the after care stuff within like 4 days. Just relax and do it, its a cute piercing that isn't difficult or dangerous to maintain. If it gets infected beyond whats normal then take it out, as long as you dont competely disregard that its in your ear it will be fine<br>  And believe me you will know when its becoming infected cause then it hurts. Good luck!!|`|XADP739faa	Well to tell you the truth, all piercings are going to hurt. Your ear will hurt, but only for a little while, just don't touch it and bother it once you get it done. Your ear will feel all hot and red, but don't worry that's normal. You either get the piercing or you don't. It's simple|`|fl57jdG7aa	I got my ear cartilage pierced and honestly, It didn't hurt me at all, I barely felt it. It all depends on your pain tolerance. Don't be scared you should be fine, it goes really quick. If you get it , you have to make sure you take care of it and clean it good because it's prone to infections. I have an infection in mine and I'm trying my best to clear it up.If you do get an infection do sea salt water soaks, just let the water get in the hole .Overall I love the piercing =)|`|PZePfliGaa	the piercing does not hurt...it just goes straight through...you cant even feel it....after its pierced it'll sting just a little and turn red...just dont mess with it or irritate it and you'll be fine...plus it looks cute! : )|`|gy7m1D1Taa	Go to your local mall and check out clairs or peircing pagoda. it doesnt hurt. but take car of it. alot of my piercings on my ears got infected easy.|`|dFvdeXt9aa	it doesnt hurt. and its very quick if you get it done with a gun, like at Clairs or something
sbbF6T9raa	messy (:|`|0xgVNOsaaa	MESSY DEFINITLY...oh why was i in caps...hahahaha! messy tho!|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Who cares
JDQP0Phraa	I don't think so. Most stores will only accept items that haven't been worn and still have original tags/receipt.|`|aoyVeq16aa	Ehhh.. i have done it. <br>  just dont mention that you washed them and dont leave like a dryer sheet stuck to them  :)<br>  the people working at the store probably wont know/care too much.<br>  <br>  just take them back. you dont have to say anything. make sure you have the receipt!|`|Dujw71Muaa	You have to have the receipt and the tag on the pants when you return it. Good luck trying to return it. =D|`|bL3rzrEYaa	Depends on the store.<br>  <br>  Macy's, yes, I've done it before.<br>  <br>  Depends on the store, and the manager.|`|VHDLTFG2aa	yea you just shouldn't have bought them...you can't return them|`|k828yC3Kaa	They have to have the tags on them.|`|k1qwNB7jaa	I don't think you should take them back.
balYkPJ0aa	I think you need to ask yourself how come the seller is selling this ring 'Buy It Now' for ￡100 if they recently had it valued for ￡575?<br>  <br>  We all like to think we're getting a bargain, but don't be fooled.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps & Good luck:)|`|ImnSrFiKaa	i don't like it.|`|i0hN5gbbaa	Don't do it|`|rkeLJ8RAaa	dont trust ebay... go 2 a real jewlery store|`|5vgnrvcmaa	First, when purchasing a ring with diamonds, especially from a picture, you should ask what the clarity and color are. Ask the seller about that. Also 9K gold is not very good and will be a different color than any 14K jewelry you already have. It looks like a nice ring, but wait for the clarity and color info and then you'd be able to compare better.|`|st5reHVjaa	i dont like it.<br>  it looks awful.<br>  dont buy an engagment type ring off of ebay!<br>  go to an actual store!!|`|LyjCLnXgaa	No No No ..............don't do it. It's a scam or something like that. Guy is loosing ￡475 according to the valuation just to let somebody on ebay  (the buyer) get it for a ￡100. NO WAY<br>  Ask the Samaritan seller why he is so generous. <br>   On the other hand the ring may be valued  so high for insurance purposes. But it's up to you.|`|MqMjn9Ucaa	i don't think that its a good idea to buy it because it sound too good to be true and i wouldn't trust people on ebay and to be honest i don't really care for it.|`|9MtKzSE8aa	I dont like it.<br>   Not worth the money. Keep looking elsewhere and i bet you will find something a lot more worth your money.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	I wouldn't buy diamonds on eBay.  Go to a jeweler.
Y0WSB4C2aa	go for it! you never know if you don't try :)<br>  <br>  i looove platinum blonde. do it!|`|3KLeGd11aa	give us a picture and then we could tell better.|`|lLAjT8mjaa	I have VERY bad news for you. I'm not really sure how dark your hair is now, but the only way to lighten your hair is to bleach it and even then it won't go platinum. It will probably only turn to a light brown or even a medium brown.... sometimes orange. The best way to have your hair stripped is to go to a hairstylist. Your best bet, right now, is to let your natural color grow in, then bleach it to a blonde.<br>  <br>  I am naturally VERY blonde and I dyed my hair dark brown last year, almost black. Well, i decided i wanted to go back to blonde and i had one of my beautician friend bleach it for me. She was a little inexperienced and didn't realize that there was a chance that it could turn orange and low and behold it processed to a bright orange color. What did she do? She decided to double process it, which is where you bleach it a second time. Well, that completely killed my hair and we had to cut it off to the point where I had about 4 inches of hair left. I just don't want to see someone else have to go through what I did. So, if you want to be blonde, just wait until your natural color is back then bleach it. It will give you the best results and your hair will be a lot healthier when you're done.

QrjjiOgTaa	i am using bare minerals now and i have never had more pimples in my life than i do now!!!! maybe theres some other reason but it all started weeks after using bare minerals, it does feel nice on your skin and has a sunscreen in it. its around 30-40 bucks depending on what you get.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	loreal bare minerals? i would guess it's probably about $6-$12.<br>  <br>  i use rimmel cover up stick, i used to use it all over my face everyday but i started breaking out ALOT, and i would only have to use it more to cover up my break outs.<br>  now i only use it when i have a nasty pimple or blemish that i really need to cover.<br>  and always remember to take your face makeup off at night! not just your eye makeup! i usually forget i have coverup on, then i leave it on over night which is bad because your pores will get clogged, which leads to breakouts.|`|m2eHPeciaa	in my opinion, it depends on HOW U APPLY ur foundation and the way u cleanse ur face. i do have acne, but do not break out. i use Cetaphil to wash my face, and use clinique's dramatically different gel moisturizer. then, i apply MAC's studio fix foundation with a MAC 109 brush. (brushes are more cleaner, sanitation wise, if u wash it after every use) <br>  <br>  but to answer ur question, NO different types of make up do not usually irritate ur skin. it takes ur skin 20-30 days to get used to any product. so give ur product some time, and if it still irritates ur skin after 20-30 days, get rid of it, its no good.|`|07323ce4cd96a6103c2548dd932d6f46aa	Yes.<br>  Get powder over liquid, as powder is not as oily.<br>  Or, don't wear cover-up at all, which is probably the best route to go for minimizing break-outs.<br>  Just think, if you can keep your skin clear, you might not need the cover-up.|`|2DbnttgXaa	Yeah it will effect breaking out, if it's got loads of oily products in it, it will make things like breaking out worse. The oil seeps through the skin and makes it greasier. <br>  <br>  im sorry i dont know about the bare minerals?
QrjjiOgTaa	well here in america no one cares. if you have the money just walk up to the counter with the products and purchase them. they also make fake eyelashes with the glue already on them, but i did not have good luck with these!|`|MqMjn9Ucaa	no you don't have to be a certain age. But i must worn you that they are very tricky to put on. i recommend getting maybellines XXI, works much better and much easier to get on|`|07323ce4cd96a6103c2548dd932d6f46aa	There is no age restriction where I am (USA) for buying fake eyelashes.<br>  I've bought them while underage and no one tried to stop me, and I don't look old, either.<br>  <br>  The restrictions on chemicals are not that strict that you can't buy something like fake eyelashes which hardly has any glue in it.|`|L9b7sUbFaa	nah. not at all<br>  <br>  <br>  its not dangerous<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  mac has some really great ones but you can get them almost everywhere<br>  <br>  department store or drug store!|`|3lXZzK5caa	no you dont have to be a certain age...you can get them pretty much anywhere too like walmart or walgreens|`|kuTVtTFUaa	i dont think u have to be a particular age to buy them <br>  u can get them any where|`|eevOrwypaa	You don't have to be an adult to buy false eyelashes. They usually run about 7 dollars, and if you take care of them, you can usually wear them a few times before they are completely nasty. Just be careful on the glue, and don't put too much on. It does not take a lot of glue to keep them in place. Be careful about getting the glue on the eye lashes also, which is hard the first time you use them. Sometimes if you put too much glue on, you can see the white glue on the edge of your eye (close to where your eyelashes begin.) To help with this, before you put the false eyelashes on try putting eyeliner on your top lid. It helps :) For the full effect of false eyelashes, don't put mascara on your regular lashes, it makes them stand out, usually in a bad way. When you take them off, start at the edge away from the inside of your eye and try to grab the base of the eyelashes. If you can help it, don't grap the false eyelashes. This can make the false eyelashes break in half. When you get them off, place them in the container exactly how they came, and there ready to go for next time :) hope this helps! :)|`|iTjZMSukaa	no, there's no age limit. but if you're under 13, you definitely don't need false eyelashes, because your eyelashes are so young and beautiful and you don't need to cover them up. they can also be a pain cuz they can fall off and tug. u dont want that! if i had to set a limit, i'd say about 18 year olds are safe with em, but still not needed!|`|m2eHPeciaa	u don't have to be a certain age. but they do have different types of eyelash: long, thin, thick, colors, etc. jus make sure to NOT GLUE THEM on ur lash line. after using them consistently, u'll pull off several of ur natural lashes.|`|c7f42dca10585b7c08b39d06131b82a9aa	no age limit (:<br>  <br>  good choice going with the glue, the 'self adhesive' ones dont work at all.

XFDkr6OIaa	well it depends how big it is and it depends what your belly button looks like... probably not but if you have the kind of parents that inspect your body they might find it. oh and if it gets infected then its a dead give away. my suggestion is that when i wanted to pierce my lip i had thoughts of doing it myself but i just asked my parents for a couple months like twice a day and they finally said yes so... <br>  good luck|`|AA10287804	If you're worried, then why get it pierced? Is it really that important?|`|0AQF8pnKaa	most likely. unless it's really, really small. i wouldn't suggest it, i think they're sorta ugly.|`|H61TC1PUaa	If your of age then you don't have to hide it from them,but if your underage just wait until you can do it legally.
ex0AFKH8aa	you can but i dont recommend it. im assuming that but antibacterial wipes you mean alcohol wipes? The ones they give you to put on it after getting it peirced to cool it down?<br>  Anyway those remove both the good and bacteria.<br>  The peircist should have given you cleaning instructions, stick to them.<br>  Good Luck|`|U7vLYGodaa	NO if they have alcohol on them they are too strong for the piercing. you should clean it with sea salt soaks 2x a day. 1/4 teaspoon of salt to 8 oz of water

It also helps if the model has the same face shape as you. <br>  2.Cut out the pictures and show them to friends and ask their opinion about which style they think would flatter you the most. Above all remember that you are the one that has to be pleased. <br>  3.Ask if there are any particular toolsthat you would need in order to recreate that style. If your hair is curly and the picture you like has straight hair, then you would need to either get it chemically straightened our invest in a good flat iron. If this is not in your budget, then it is best to work with your natural texture. <br>  4.Get your hair cut. This is where you cannot afford to be cheap. A good stylist may cost more then you are usually willing to pay, but remember that it is important that you get a good stylist. This will help insure that you love your hair when it is finished. <br>  5.Make sure that you ask your stylist how to re-create your look at home. <br>  6.Buy products so that you can re-create your look on your own. You do not need to buy the most expensive products|`|AfFXI6z3aa	i think this one is real pretty<br>  <br>  <a href="http://hairbrained.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/rachel-mcadams-hair-latest-hairstyles-com.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://hairbrained.files.wordpress.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  and you could do this<a href="http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff76/BayleaP/rachel-mcadams-hair-styles.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i237.photobucket.com/albums/ff76/...</a>|`|nOVSf06Raa	I really like those here is one<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.easy-hairstyles.com/images/short-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.easy-hairstyles.com/images/sh...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.zimbio.com/member/westernfashion/articles/3679966/2009+Women+Short+Haircuts" rel="nofollow">http://www.zimbio.com/member/westernfash...</a>

ORVQiiQCaa	Okay I have the same problem.  But mine get's dry and it peels, so when I put on foundation it's really disgusting.  What I have to do is step one: exfoliate.  Step two: Lotion. <br>  You can exfoliate with a loofa or whatever those are called.  The sponges you use when your showering.  You can also buy a face wash with the exfoliating beads in it. <br>  For the lotion,  I get collegen based lotions.  Like st. Ives. <br>  It helps with the redness, and it heals your skin faster.  A plus is you can use it all over your body! :)

jr7qzrEJaa	I wouldn't try to look like your cousin, just looking like her isn't going to make you really feel any better. I would consider myself to be preppy, but being preppy is not just a way of dressing it really is a lifestyle. You don't have to have a lot of money to be preppy, its really about the way you carry yourself and your values that make you "preppy". Working on these things will make you feel more confident and you'll be your own person instead of a copy of your cousin. but you asked for the looks piece, so here it is:<br>  <br>  dress preppy. this includes chino pants/shorts, cartigans, fitted polos, tshirts, button downs, and things you've acquired over the years (like sports team). do NOT dress sluttier, this will attract the wrong kind of attention and you might be labeled as somthing you're not. you dont need a lot of money to dress preppy, in fact, its preppier to wear worn in, old, classic clothes than super expensive frilly ones. abercrombie, aeropostle, american eagle, pacsun, etc are NOT preppy. they are cheap immitations that are tacky and fake. instead, go for classic brands like j crew, ralph lauren, rugby, lilly pulitzer, jack rodgers, sperry, clarks wallabees, lauren moffett, tory burch, etc. these clothes can get pricey so plan ahead to go shopping when stores are having sales, or shop online.  make sure you are always dressed for the occassion and season. good ways to bring summer dresses into your fall/winter wardrobe is to pair them with textured tights (no leggings!) or opague tights in bright colors and flats or boots. make sure your clothes are always neat and fit well, clothing that is too loose or tight is never flattering. as for jewelry, less is always more. go with one statement peice and smaller, more understated others. like if you wear big earrings, wear a simple bracelet. try to invest in a signature piece of jewelry that you always wear, this should be something simple yet classsy. although many people would go with tiffany's, i think they're over done. i suggest the cartier love bracelet with the nylon strap. this was a big investment for me, but i alwaya wear it. also, invest in a good watch, michele watches are a good choice. but other less expensive brands can look just as nice.as for nails, keep them short and clean, preferably clear, light pink, or no polish. but if you like brighter colors, just make sure they aren't chipped. try and get a natural tan by playing sports or running outside, even walking your dog can be a chance to get a natural tan. but always wear sunscreen! keep your hair a natural color, don't go crazy with the cut either, keep it simple. don't wear a lot of make up, concealer, mascara, chapstik, and a little blush or bronzer should be perfect for casual days. you can go more bold for fancier events but remember to only choose one feature to focus on (either bold lips OR eyes, never both). dont wear tons of pinkand green, ribbons, and fake pearls. a true prep would rather wear her older brothers lacrosse jacket, a baseball hat, perfectly broken in jeans, a fitted white t shirt, navy jack purcell tennis shoes, and a big leather tote bag than the cliche high ponytail with a pink ribbon, fake pearl necklace, pleated denim jean mini skirt, pink uggs, and a north face so many people wrongly discribe as preppy. always always go for quality over quantity when you go shopping. go for classy over trashy, and classic over trendy clothes. <br>  example outfits & occasions:<br>  1. out to a nice dinner with family :<br>  -a classic shift dress in a color that matches the current season<br>  -classic pumps or flats, even sandals if the occasion is more casual<br>  -black tights and pumps if its winter<br>  -patterned/eyelit lilly puitzer dress if its spring with white wedges<br>  -minimal make up <br>  -simple hair. down or loose bun<br>  <br>  2. out to lunch on the weekend with friends:<br>  -a pair of good fitting jeans<br>  -moccasins, i suggest minnetonka, but whatever you like works<br>  -sandals or flip flops if its summer<br>  -any cute classy top, i would go with a billowy hippieish blouse<br>  -no nail polish, minimal make up, simple hair<br>  -bangel bracelets and simple post earrings<br>  <br>  3. normal school day (winter) :<br>  -black opague tights<br>  -black slouchy sweater uggs (not very classic, but so comfy!) or cole haan loafers<br>  -simple cute dress<br>  -hair in a loose ballet bun, a headband with a LITTLE bow on one side<br>  -long necklace, chunky watch, minimal other jewelry<br>  - a fitted peacoat<br>  <br>  finally this was on urban dictionary and i completely agree :<br>  <br>  prep:<br>  <br>  Typically, this word has become a derogatory name for a guy or a girl who takes pride in the way they approach, and appear, in life. Common misconceptions about "preps" are that we are a bunch of cocky, New England elitist types who have more money than God, himself, and an inherent desire to flaunt it in the form of clothing, cars, housing, education and social standing. <br>  <br>  First off: You don't have to be from the north to be a prep. Let me make this very clear.|`|wgm9ADfBaa	go to a tanning booth or get some spray tan. where cute really tiny shorts tight shirts cupped bras straighten your hair makeup|`|Xly2sF6waa	Cloths are not what makes some one look pretty to guys; it is the lack there of.

AA10849332	pain is relative to your tolerance. the only way to truly know how much it will hurt for you is to actually get it done. I think that really the only general agreed upon piercing that does hurt is nipples, which is one you didn't even ask about.<br>  <br>  surface piercings can be painful depending on how much flesh they go through. of the piercings you listed, eyebrow, nape (back of neck), bridge (between the eyes) and hips are all surface piercings. surface piercings tend to have a higher rate of rejection especially in high motion areas like your hips and nape. eyebrow and bridge piercings tend to reject easily because there isn't much flesh there in the first place.<br>  <br>  I've had my tongue pierced and my lip twice (spider bites not done at the same time). my tongue was mostly a feeling of pressure (the real pain comes in the swelling in the days that follow), first lip piercing didn't hurt at al and the second one was done hurting by the time I counted to three.<br>  <br>  cheek piercings are a type of deep tissue piercing and not all people are able to get them. It depends on how your veins, nerves and even your muscle goes through your cheeks. the people I know who have gotten this piercing said that the pain wasn't so much in getting the piercing done as it was in the swelling and bruising that resulted in the first couple of weeks of healing.<br>  <br>  lobe piercings don't really hurt. cartilage piercings do for many, but to be honest, mine didn't hurt very much until a few days after being done and then it was mostly a dull throb that went away after a couple of weeks.<br>  <br>  for ANY piercing, make sure you get it done with a needle and NOT with a gun. most body piercings can't be done with a gun anyway and even the ones that can be (ears) its better to be done with a needle.|`|uR5aNpHGaa	well obviously it will hurt at least alittle<br>  i mean piercings do hurt somewhat<br>  but from what ive heard those hurt but not as bad as most people would think<br>  from what ive been told people psych themselves out and expect them to hurt more than they do<br>  but they still hurt hah<br>  however ears dont hurt and everyone i know with their eyebrows says its not bad<br>  but i only have nose so everything i just said is just what ive heard<br>  its not from personal expierence hah|`|XBJAewIYaa	i'd say the back of neck, hips and cheeks would hurt more than others. i got 3 on my lips, 3 on my nose and 1 1/16 lobe and those don't really hurt a lot.|`|5EQdzWuUaa	all of those are stupid.|`|NUc6Aw9Gaa	They all hurt as you can imagine getting a needle stuck in you would hurt/ They aren't too bad and you soon forget about it but there is def pain involved|`|U7vLYGodaa	Tongue doesnt hurt back of neck hurts a little biit lips feel just like ear lobe piercings, and cheeks dont hurt but the after care is a ***** hips hurt  a little bit between the eyes is called a bridge, I dont have one so I dont know if it hurts.<br>  <br>  a little ouch is worth it for the  piercings. just know that nape and cheek and hip piercings are really hard to heal. if they ever heal. they take a year to heal for the ones that do heal.and they are very likely to reject|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	okay, ALL piercings hurt to a certain point. you are sticking needles through your body!<br>  the ones that would hurt the least: eyebrow, back of neck, between eyes, tongue, lips, and hips.<br>  <br>  ones that would hurt more: cheeks and piercing all around your ear will hurt the most.<br>  but if you want to pierce all around your ears, do not do it all at once. do about 2 at a time [2 sets of piercings] about 3 weeks apart.|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Eyebrow isn't too bad.  Earlobe piercings don't hurt, but cartilage piercings do. <br>  <br>  As far of the rest, I can't really help.

store...and maybe even learning how to spell would be nice.
ZoeS825Kaa	I have actually had this problem before. It's kind of a sensitive thing to bring up to your girl but i eventually found a way to hint at it without embarrassing her.  What i did was i grabbed the shitty underwear, cut out the shitty part of it and dropped it into a cup of milk, after that i stirred it up a bit until it got a chocolate color and i served it to her. As expected she said "hey this milk taste like ****" and i politely replied "Yes honey, I know. That's because its made with all that **** you leave in your panties." And that was the end of that problem.|`|6uhnyEYEaa	eww, eww and eww. but...  just say, hey i think you should leave your panties on if you have "marks" in them. i don't care but i am just saying....    answer my question people! thanks! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuytRirqORVlNq9tDqaokjnsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220134327AAyic40">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	HAHA. don't say anything to her, because it will probably embarrass the crap out of her. no pun intended hahahahaha.<br>  <br>  try subtly hinting about taking a shower together or something?|`|07323ce4cd96a6103c2548dd932d6f46aa	It's most likely from her period.<br>  Does it smell like poop or does it smell like blood/nothing?|`|dh0av988aa	consult her about her diet,maybe she eats too much spicy foods like mexican.lmao im done.do what the clown said|`|qYbFMRcUaa	it could be old period blood|`|Y0WSB4C2aa	oh.|`|IT7ka3Ybaa	lick her *** clean|`|AA11961672	get her some baby wipes and place them in her bathroom?<br>  <br>  there is not much you can say without embarrassing her and making her mad.|`|Y0O6971laa	It's most likely period blood.|`|JDQP0Phraa	Dude, that's sick!

If she's old enough to have a boyfriend, she's old enough to know how to wipe properly.|`|ALh5R37jaa	haha wow, i'm sorry but this is kinda funny.<br>  You probably shouldn't say anything to her.<br>  It will get her offended. What you could do is wash it for her, and get them out?<br>  <br>  idk, i'm sorry, i hope i could help :)|`|0vQsoYIbaa	You should try wearing your own underwear to avoid these embarrassing situations.|`|4UXJoMbKaa	Perhaps, not look into your girlfriend's panties.<br>  ;D|`|XADP739faa	'I get turned on when i find human crap in your panties'
JDQP0Phraa	Don't be pressured into forgiving that girl. She sounds like a major backstabbing slut, not someone you want in your life. Make new friends and try not to talk to this girl anymore at all.|`|DeQsKdmSaa	Dont talk to her. This girl really betrayed you, and that is a horrible thing to do!!!|`|36AE3lZuaa	omg wow! thats omg!! well you should tell your close friend that you still dont think you can trust that girl and plus you DO NOT want to be friends with someone like that girl who sent the pics!!|`|XEboNQYFaa	the exact same thing happened to me.. just dont talk to her, give her time.. make them want to be your friend again....  im so sorry by the way|`|QwuIGBgeaa	she feels like she can trust her, or does not care at all. <br>  <br>  I would say, dont talk to her, you have to weed out all bad people in your life or they will drag you down too. If she does this one time, she will hurt you again.<br>  <br>  You must not go down to her level and talk about her behind her back and be rude, or mean to her. Karma always comes around and gets these people back. Like I said if you do bad thing to her to retaliate you will be as bad as she is.<br>  <br>  Take the higher road, get them out of your life and be a better person than they are, other wil notice this and realize you are much more mature and that the other girls need to grow up.|`|wp5TjXT4aa	Get rid of that person. She is not your friend. Friends do not do that to eachother. Let the guy know that if she is sending him naked pics of herself, he probably is not the only one. He should'nt feel special and a girl that has no respect for herself will send naked pictures of herself to anybody.  She is hungry for attention and will try to get it from anybody that will give it to her. She will also betray anybody that may steal the spotlight from her.|`|5LuBDe75aa	you should let your friend talk to her, but if you still need time to let everything settle, then there's nothing wrong with that. you can still be friends with the girl who's talking to the girl that back stabbed you. there's no point in losing 2 friends just because one of them is talking to someone you're mad at.|`|WKlCum9Raa	Alright, ive been through this before so i know what im talking about. i had a friend like that to. she stabbed one of our friends in the back several times and started many "wars" between us.During these "wars" we wouldn't talk to one another for about a week. it was tiring and i finally learned that not talking to some one does not help the situation or solve it. in fact it may make it worse. u keep all that rage and sorrow locked up and pretty soon u get so full of those feelings and you crack. not talking wont fix anything and its kind of childish. u must confront this girl who sent those naked pics. you dont have to apologize and she dosnt have to apologize. u just need to tell her how that makes you feel.tell her you dont like it when she does that but dont accuse her of anything like"u r such a *****!" or "u dont care about anyone but u!" insted say "y would you do something like that to me? arent we friends? " or " i kno at one time u were my friend so y r u trying to hurt me?"  OR (haha)  "it really hurts my feelings when u do stuff like that."  she may  understand and stop or she may continue with this behavior. u may never b friends again or u may, it really depends on your actions. remember you owe her nothing. and remember that as time goes by people change and she may not b the same person she was, but it wont last forever and youll find other people that really care for you.

When I was in high school, I traded rings with my sweetheart and when we split up he wouldn't give me my ring out of spite I tried to give him his.  I never got my ring back and ended up throwing his out of the car window on a back road one day years later. I just think there are other ways.  Besides if the relationship sours and you get it back you will think of her when you see it and you hopefully wouldn't use it in another relationship, it's kind of like re-giving an engagement ring when the first engagement didn't work out, or writing the same poem to every girl your with but just changing the name on the top, ya know? You don't do it! Class ring is very important, it symbolizes your high school career and I have heard horror stories of people never getting their rings back I strongly advise against it.|`|7f7547ce6ae07c763915978ab531d418aa	It usually means you're going steady but you have to ask her outright if she wants to.

Getting one is one heck of a lot easier than getting one removed if you decide you don't like it some day.|`|7oetZ4I3aa	it will get stretched out and disfigured, especially if its script it will probably be illegible or very hard to read, i recommend getting it on your back, or wait until after you have kids|`|ELkswWpCaa	yeah if you want kids don't get it there. it will not only stretch the tattoo but scar it with stretch marks. maybe get it on your back or leg|`|3e0fb112d935519e50f071750d581bcdaa	Erm... yeah I might suggest getting it in another area. Or save it for after kids. I knew this lady who had flames in the same spot - when she got pregnant it looked like a forest fire.

hiJCkXX0aa	HMMM, WELL WITH CIRCLE LENS, ITS THE BLACK RIM ON SOME LENS THAT ALSO GIVES THE BIGGER LOOKING EFFECT. SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT COLOR AND DESIGN YOU GET. FOR EXAMPLE, GEO ANGEL SERIES WILL GIVE YOU A BIGGER LOOKING EFFECT THEN GEO TRI COLOR SERIES, BECAUSE OF THE BLACK RING ON THE ANGEL. GEO ANGEL BLACK ALSO GIVES A NICE BIG EYE EFFECT.

Yes, as a result of wearing for many hours,days, years, you can achieve a smaller waist line.|`|264GS7s7aa	no|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	i have been reading up on this because i want to start corset waist training. it does make your waist smaller over time. but not flatter. and  you have to wear it 23/7 (23 hours a day except when your showering, 7 days a week) and you have to wear it to bed. and it takes months to years depending on how much of the waist you want to reduce.<br>  oh and it has to be a  certain corset, it cant just be one of those flimsy corsets from hot topic or whatever, they have to be the steele boned ones, etc. and they cost like a couple hundred dollars :[<br>  but google corset waist training and you can find more info on it.|`|sIbpcU6Naa	<a href="http://cheeju.files.wordpress.com/2007/08/cathe-jung.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cheeju.files.wordpress.com/2007/0...</a>  :P|`|0kXlNWcMaa	no<br>  to get your stomach flatter you have to excercise.|`|RbsV1JvSaa	nooooooo. it just makes ur flesh look all weird and wrinkly.|`|wEKhOOOSaa	Yes it's true <br>  A women holds a guiness world record for the tiniest waist by wearing corsets.

8a9e7b6a536894e00efd76cd227f0649aa	To tell you the truth I don't think that jacket will really ever go on clearance. Usually, unless the sweatshirt/jacket is just really ugly or whatever, then MAYBE it will go on sale. do you HAVE to have the hollister logo on it? Because I got mine from Urban Behavior and it was around $40 (but I don't think they sell them anymore) and I think you can get some at Tilly's. If you REALLY want to get the Hollister ones maybe go on ebay and bid for a new one for cheaper.

xBwbINYOaa	There are two reasons why you shouldn't use Sun-in. Reason number one is that is will turn your hair orange. A friend of mine has hair similar to what yours sounds like and when she used Sun-in her hair turned really really orange. The other reason is that Sun-in is really bad for your hair. I talked to my hairdresser and she is strongly against it. She said it fries your hair and will most likely make it dried out and frizzy. You might want to try something called low-lights if your looking for a small change but nothing drastic. They are similar to high-lights but they are not as intense. I would recommend talking to your hairdresser if that's something you're interested in.|`|dz9K4K2Raa	I am not sure Sun in is the best product.  It might turn it orange.  Go for a better product.   There are some products just for hightlights.  And it would be a good idea to just do a small test section first.  Good luck.|`|9U4YjSqgaa	don't do sun-in.<br>  seriously, especially on brown hair, it will turn it orange.|`|GjZRzfeuaa	It might make your hair lighter! I'd try a strand test first!

KnTrvQd6aa	Depilatory creams are unlikely to work well on your hair, simply because the testosterone in your body will have caused them to develop into terminal hairs, rather than villous hairs. It might be worth trying, but don't be too surprised if they don't work. <br>  The same applies for waxing; shaving is more effective, but brings it's own problems, which I'm sure you know about.<br>  <br>  There are only two ways to permanently remove terminal hair; Electrolysis, or Laser. Both are effective; both are painful; Electro is slightly cheaper, but hurts more, and takes longer; Laser is more expensive, hurts (slightly) less, and is a little quicker.<br>  Either method will be more effective once you've been on hormone therapy for a while; reducing the circulating testosterone, and increasing oestrogen, slows regrowth after the hairs are removed.|`|M627my7Baa	Waxing strips are kinda hard . . .go to a salon and have them do it for you. Or a beauty school if you want to save a little money!|`|D8m1eqlVaa	I would recommend sugaring - it works on even the thickest hair, doesn't cost much because you make the solution at home, is less painful and less damaging than waxing, and keeps the hair away for weeks at time, and when it grows back it is less noticeable and thinner.  I use it every couple of weeks on my face, bikini line, and legs with great results. I can say without a doubt, that sugaring is better than waxing, mainly because its natural, cheap, and I find it doesn't hurt as bad.<br>  <br>  Here's an article on how to do it if you're interested:<br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4748097_perform-sugaring-hair-removal.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4748097_perform-...</a><br>  <br>  Good luck!

I would say the best is waxing. If you cant wax perhaps plucking.Depilatory creams can be ok but tthey don'ttake the root out  so the hair grows back as fast as shaving.|`|DYBUrvP7aa	waxing strips are really good.
44RpLWb7aa	the Y!A people don't like questions like that (i.e the "i am pretty" and "rate me" questions).<br>  those types of questions are quite annoying and pointless.<br>  if you want your looks to be judged, ask your friends. they're blunt and they know what you look like better than we do.|`|K4Pwd3kfaa	They're annoying and totally pointless.

dM1jwSGyaa	They're okay, but they just look like fake crochet Uggs. People are going to think you don't have enough money to buy authentic Uggs. I would suggest buying a totally different style of boot so that nobody can accuse you of being a poseur, or I would fork over the $100 USD (I think?) for the real crochet Uggs.|`|cqzZjRVwaa	Yes, team them with blue jeans (preferably skinny) and tuck the jeans inside the boots.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|b3FkhOicaa	they look like pretty realistic fuggs.

JStJ38Itaa	MAC foundations are AMAZING ! They are what celebs use when they need a flawless look.<br>  Go for it and buy it :D|`|oA066Stbaa	yeah! you get what you pay for! i like all the Designer brands. but careful sometimes there really is no difference between any of them.|`|m2eHPeciaa	well, there's different types of MAC foundations for different types of coverage. (personally) i use MAC's studio fix foundation and have not found any other drug store brand like it. a good suggestion tho, if ur thinking money wise, is invest in a good makeup brush. a MAC 109 brush for foundation application is what i use, and it makes me use less product and make me look absolutely flawless! good luck! hope this helps :)|`|RXhP9B5Maa	absolutely beautiful|`|wLqdC89taa	it sure does it gives your face an over all glow|`|3lXZzK5caa	ummm idk!! good question though!!
Y0WSB4C2aa	i love bedhead products. i've owned like everything of that brand: straightener, blowdrier and curling irons. they're erally good quality and that's pretty good for that straightener. mine slowly died and i replaced it with a CHI. and it's VERY much worth the $90 i paid for it. but try the bedhead out if you're looking for a basic straightener that's quality|`|otinl2ucaa	its jacked.<br>  dont get it.<br>  not worth the money.|`|c8bqmaQiaa	noo...i wouldn't get one unless you have super thin hair because they don't get neaarly hot enough.|`|8gqRZ90Caa	nooooooo we have to blue one and its junk... i would not recomend it to anyone. it doesnt get very hot. and like... idk... i just wouldnt get it...
Dfqu7UTJaa	Why don't you try Forever21? They have inexpensive stuff, but it holds up well and is perfect for your age. Some of it's a little "funky", but you can find pieces that are really pretty and good for every day.<br>  Another place that is good if you wanted to spend a little more would be New York and Company.. their clothes are a little more grown up, but if you're looking for a more conservative look their things will be perfect for you. And if you sign up for their emails online, they send out tons of coupons! Try flowy skirts and faux-wrap shirts, or sundresses. For everyday, jeans and camisoles with cardigans and ballet flats.. which you can mix and match.. skirts with cardigans or jeans with the wrap tops. Make sense?<br>  <br>  For your fiancee, try someplace like Macy's.. they have cool stuff for guys, so he can still keep his same style and be himself, but it's just a bit more grown-up... like Zoo York or Ed Hardy (again, a little expensive, but he can get key pieces to wear every day)... or he should try American Eagle, they have great jeans and argyle vests.. that'd be a good look for him. <br>  <br>  Good luck! xoxo|`|b3FkhOicaa	This is the right section, don't worry!<br>  <br>  To start off, you need a few basic pieces.  For you:<br>  <br>  A black knee-length skirt<br>  A good-fitting pair of dark wash woman jeans<br>  Black pants<br>  A structured, feminine jacket.  A trenchcoat or pea coat are really in style now, and are always in style. <br>  A few cardigans, V-neck shirts, and other everyday casual shirts that fit your body well.<br>  Sweaters or blazers that have a defined waist<br>  <br>  A few examples:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=358707&CategoryID=35150" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=362655&CategoryID=22417" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=322066&CategoryID=22814" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  Every single thing you buy for yourself should be from the Women's section, it will flatter your body best.  And if you are looking for comfort, wear cotton, women clothes can be very comfortable too!  <br>  <br>  For your fiance:<br>  <br>  He also needs basic pieces he can mix and match, that will not go out of style.<br>  <br>  A few button-down shirts in colors like white or light blue.  Striped if he wants.<br>  A few pairs of well-fitting jeans.<br>  A suit<br>  Khaki pants<br>  T shirts- for at home<br>  A sweater or two<br>  Polos<br>  <br>  Here are some ideas of what I mean:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=325526&CategoryID=39897" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=358638&CategoryID=21525" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=360269&CategoryID=42900" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/index.ognc?ID=355773&CategoryID=20634" rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Some good brand names are Ralph Lauren (although this may be a bit expensive), Gap, J. Jill (for you), Anne Taylor (for you), J.Crew, Banana Republic, Forever 21, (yes, they have a men's section), and any department store, like Macy's, JC Penny's, or Nordsrom's.  The staff at Nordstrom's is especially helpful and can give you a lot of help in finding things.  <br>  <br>  Some things to keep in mind:<br>  <br>  -Although you need a few basic, neutral pieces, you need a burst of color in every outfit.  Try buying a colorful scarf, belt, or necklace to accessorize and brighten up an outfit!<br>  -Neutral colors like black, brown, gray, white, and tan go with almost every other color.<br>  <br>  <br>  I really hope this helps!

I'm only a B cup but some of those push up bras are so good at what they do, I spill out of them (not my cup of tea).  Many of their bras have the soft push up gels at the bottom of the cup which work very very well and are comfortable, more so for smaller breasts than for someone my size, which is average.<br>  <br>  If none of the females in your family are well endowed, chances are you won't get much bigger naturally.

It depends on where you live, but I live in BC and there is a place called Second Tyme Around that pay me for my old clothes.

H2l7tFFHaa	YOU CAN PUT ROLLERS/SPIRL CURLS AT THE TOP AND FLAT IRON THE BOTTOM!|`|d4eS4sHaaa	just improvise with it (try a small ponytail) and let it grow once its grown go for a natural brown colour get a sidefringe cut in get a few layers not many tho but let it grow, if u dont really like long hair and prefer short hair wel then theres not much u can do with it so i think u should let it grow at least to your shoulders, more u can do with it then!
jGBk09aeaa	First...the more you "dry" your skin with acne products the worse it gets....as your oil drys up the skin trys to replace it with more oil...a never ending battle.  If you are young moisturizer is not so important.  Make sure to use a great toner after washing face.  Your skin may feel dry or tight but as the natural lipid barrier returns (about 20 min) your will feel  better.  Use sunscreen.|`|AA11101361	No.  When you put that dolop of moisturizer in your palm it should be no larger than a quarter.  More moisturizer won't help the oil, it will probably make your face feel oilier than normal.|`|OaP5Zaaeaa	well, it depends on the moisturizer. right now im using avon cream for marks on my skin.<br>  <br>  But St. ives apricot scrub doesn't make your skin oily and it dosent dry it out. it just FEELS and LOOKs good.<br>  <br>  But if you have sensitive skin get the scrub in the gentle form.

0AQF8pnKaa	It works, but remember it's not permanently getting rid of you hair like waxing will do over time. It's basically just shaving off your hair.<br>  <br>  It doesn't hurt but it just feels like you're lightly scratching yourself.<br>  I personally wouldn't buy it again, I like my razor and shaving cream better.|`|YJPRiQQzaa	I bought it at the as seen on tv section in Walgreen's, and at first it worked pretty good, but it takes forever to do your whole leg. And it stopped working after like two times and I only did my calf! Then I had to put a new pad on it. Surprisingly though, it doesn't hurt at all, I thought it would feel like sand paper. It actually is smooth! I would definitely stick with shaving. It does just the same amount of hair removal.|`|VZzdTUtEaa	I heard it's the same as shaving and that it does hurt, waste of money.|`|e489ymwhaa	it works|`|AA11101361	They do work, but no better than shaving. It just buffs away the hair at the skin (just like shaving, which cuts away the hair at the skin line) and buffs away the dead skin cells (just like shaving, which scrapes away the dead skin cells). So, it doesn't last any longer than shaving. It also takes longer than shaving and doesn't work well anywhere other than legs or arms. Anywhere there is a sharp bend (underarms, groin), it's difficult to get in that crease.

Depending on your interest you would access people with those same interest to help you accomplish your goals. Example have sponsors for events showing that information you want out to the public.

Massage it in (stylist Garren insists the rubbing motion creates body and texture). I like Bumble and Bumble or you can try Aveda volumizing tonic .<br>  If hair is naturally coarse or curly, work a straightening balm through hair. Here's a great list of balms.<br>  Brush hair (this works the product evenly through hair). Blowdry hair straight, starting at the roots to get extra volume. Hair must be completely dry for this look to work. Blow cold air at the roots to add volume (cold air locks in a style).<br>  Separate hair into three sections, securing with a ponytail holder. (It's easier this way to curl your way through each section).<br>  To curl hair, use a wide-barrel curling iron. Starting with one section, take a 1-inch portion of hair, spritz it with styling spray (again, I love Bumble and Bumble Styling Spray) or hairspray. Wrap hair around the barrel of the curling iron. (Wrapping hair is different from the traditional curling method. You don't want to 'clip' hair into the barrel. Wrapping allows you to curl all the way to the root). When you're curling, make sure to leave ends loose to avoid a crimp mark. <br>  <br>  Release the curl after about 5-10 seconds (hold longer if you want a tighter curl). You should have a corkscrew curl.<br>  Roll curl and bobby pin it close to the scalp. (I'm lazy, so I skip this step to save time).<br>  Alternate the direction of the curl as you work your way through each section. (It's all in the direction you wind hair around the barrel of the curling iron. Start by placing hair on top of the barrel and wrapping around, then switch by putting the barrel on top of the hair before winding it around). Alternating directions makes curls look more natural. Some curls can remain tight, some loose.<br>  Once pinned curls have cooled, release them.<br>  Remove nozzle from dryer and gently loosen waves with cool air. You can also separate curls with your fingers, just make sure not to brush them out.<br>  To add shine, spritz a hair serum . Stylist David Babaii finger-combs Biosilk Silk Therapy serum into actress Kate Hudson's hair (May 2007, InStyle). You can forego hair serum and spritz with saltwater spray. I like John Frieda Beach Blonde Ocean Waves Sea spray.<br>  Set with hairspray. Just don't overdo it, you don't want new waves to feel "crunchy."<br>  What You Need:<br>  Volumizing spray<br>  Straightening balm (if you have thick, course hair)<br>  Hair dryer<br>  A 1-inch barrel curling iron<br>  Ponytail holder and bobby pins<br>  Shine serum<br>  Hairspray<br>  Saltwater spray|`|0xgVNOsaaa	oooooO! pantene has some really good stuff  that spray wax stuff. the orange labeled ones all of those items will help yu with it, uhmm spray that in and scrunch away then that should help with the waves|`|3DJVIsjiaa	when its wet put a volumizing spray or foam in it and scrunch it, or your can do loose curls spray them with hairspray and separate the curls|`|QRn984YPaa	Curl it.

pdbc4souaa	Find somebody who dresses well. It doesn't have to be exactly the way you want to look, just someone who dresses well. Ask him where he shops, build a relationship with a good clothing salesman, explain what you want. You're looking for someone who you can count on to give you good advice about your appearance, over a long period of time. Get your clothes altered to fit you. Allow time and money for the alterations to be done.|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	You might look into having one taylored for you. It's hard to find a good, perfect fitting suit for a skinny guy unless it's taylored. If you can spend some money. Go to nordstroms and ask their advice.<br>  <br>  By the way, if there's only one row of buttons, it's called single breasted. Two rows os double breasted.

I'm also tall and skinny and the funny thing is... since they tailor your suit specifically to your body, it will be the first thing that has ever fit you properly. I'm 23 and got my first suit for job interviews a couple years back. I personally like the 3 button suits best. It holds the suit tighter to your body than the 2 button. Also, the 2 button typically has more of an open breast which gives a baggy kind of look. The choice is yours, but i suggest going to the store and trying some on and see what you like. The sales people are usually pretty good about helping you find what you like.<br>  <br>  Oh, and P.S. 6'4" 180lbs... Tall and Skinny

zpovg4U7aa	Solid colored pants or vertically-striped pants are good to elongate your legs. Capris and Bermuda shorts that will fit a shorter figure are hard to find so I would stay away from those; they may end up looking a bit awkward.<br>  <br>  For comfort, I would say wear flip-flops or sandals that have about half an inch to an inch of heels on them. It'll make you at least a bit taller but won't be too tall of a heel. Tall heels aren't so casual, so low heels are good for casual looks if you want to add a bit of height.<br>  <br>  Try & avoid horizontal stripes. That goes for everyone actually, but especially thin stripes Thin stripes will make you look wider; polo stripes - thicker stripes - aren't bad though.<br>  <br>  Dresses should be as long, if not a tad bit shorter, than where your fingertips lie when you extend your arm on your side. If the dress is short it'll elongate your legs as well, but you don't want it to be too short! Classy is always better than trashy. :) Depending on your proportions; if you have shorter legs, avoid tunics because it'll shorten your legs even more.<br>  <br>  Hmm; these are what I can think of for now but hope they helped.|`|DySUxIn4aa	Always wear shoes with some sort of heel. And don't wear too long of shirts.|`|cTeVCTvOaa	vertical stripes only.......avoid wide belts......stay in same color scheme

I have the same problem so I totally understand. Make sure also that your pants actually fit you. Skinny jeans look okay on me so I do own a few pairs, but flare jeans really do fit our body types the best so they look the best on me. I also used to be a small in tops just like you, but ever since I had my little girl I am trying to get this extra weight off (I'm a medium in tops now). Just remember, the tighter your pants are around the waist the more will hang over the top. You can wear shirts that are not loose, just try on first to make sure you feel comfortable in it.<br>  <br>  If you need any help just email me!|`|CRksMyK0aa	trapeze tops and drapey tops from target and UO. <br>  they are miracle workers. also if you layer with a looser sweatshirt the muffin top kind of goes away.|`|sVdCGwIUaa	Yeah totally! You could wear sweatshirts! their cute! And if you do a few crunches every day that so called muffin top will be gone before you know it! and i am sure its not bad at all! just be yourself!|`|xdUe5CKcaa	lose some wegiht|`|tXMDzQ9jaa	well firstly i shop at american eagle and those types of stores are mostly made for the skinny people of the world. i mean, i fit into a XS when i was 12 years old! so don't feel bad that you don't look good in a L because a L there would be like a M in a regular store. <br>  <br>  also, you should defintely look towards finding a way to loose weight. a 36 inches is big (i'm 14 and i'm 24 inches) so maybe you're not getting enough exercise or you're not eating the right amount of food? ask your doctor for advice or just google how to lose weight by changing how you exercise and eat.<br>  <br>  since you're not thin, try not to wear super tight clothing like most of abercrombie's and hollister's but maybe try the clothing that is supposed to be looser or flares out. here are some examples:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid=17083&pid=594844" rel="nofollow">http://www.gap.com/browse/product.do?cid...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/product_10251_10201_480255_-1_12628_12552" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a><br>  <br>  the above styles aren't worn tight and will draw less attention to you're larger size. and most shirts come in XL or even XXL so you can try those. <br>  <br>  make sure not to go TOO baggy though because then you'll just look frumpy. wear a tight pair of jeans and then a flowing top like above to look proportional. flowey tops will also prevent people from seeing your muffin tops. <br>  <br>  hope this helps! :]
O3U7aLCDaa	Try putting on a lil bit of liner.  Put brown eyeshadow on the outer corner of your eye to the middle of ur eye and then put gold on the inner corner to the middle of ur eye.  Then put a shimmery white in the middle of ur eyelid so that it covers up about a third of ur eyelid.  Then put on lots of mascara.  If you do this it will make ur eyes pop!|`|oA066Stbaa	natruals tones of eyeshadow will look amazing, green yellow, golds, and browns are excellent for brown eyes cause they'll bring them out more. always stick to balck mascara and if you really want to eyeliner, although i would not recommend cause its ugly and i hate it.|`|XOnpTA2Naa	it depends on what you want your eyes to look. i have puppy dog eyes and i like to make my eyes smaller by adding eye liner to the lower, inside lid and a bit of masacara. to make my eyes look bright and big, i use a mascara that gives definition for a sexy look or volume for a more casual look (not sure what term to use). then use some concealer to lighten up dark circles. some shadows i use is mostly natural colors. im an avon rep so i have a site that gives makeup tips for different types of eyes. i have pics of myself where you see some difference. the first pic i i do not apply eyeliner. the second and third i did apply eye liner but used different mascara that gives different looks. im not sure if u can tell the difference but youll get the ideal. <br>  <br>  also colors of mascara makes a big difference. my third pic had dark brown while the first has black. i believe that brown colors will make brown eyes stand out more since its the one color that looks dull compare to green or blue eyes.|`|WcCJfycRaa	I've seen on QVC that bronze eye shadow brings out the color of<br>  your eys...no matter what color they are and makes them more<br>  bolder.|`|QRG1Szn6aa	um do a smokey eye thats always good you dont want too muck if you have big eyes|`|m2eHPeciaa	mmm depends. a good idea is to check out youtube.com alot of girls and guys are professional makeup artist and may help u find what ur looking for! good luck!!!
EQPE72hpaa	Curl you hair, style it, make sure it is manageable.<br>  Also, dress with elaborate clothing, and with accessories!<br>  Your local mall should have these stores:<br>  CharlotteRusse<br>  WetSeal<br>  Forever21<br>  <br>  They have clothing for any style. <br>  With your make up, use brown eyeliner (subtle, yet noticeable), mascara, use eyeshadow I think you would look nice in white eyeshadow.<br>  (Then again, that is up to you.)<br>  <br>  If you want to make more friends, try being more social!<br>  Go to places, hang out with your friends. Invite them places if you like.<br>  Have friends introduce you to more friends.<br>  Don't get shy or intimidated. Talk! Just not too much, be a good listener.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped!|`|JHOlfb1jaa	Maybe try some mascara and eyeliner...<br>  <br>  And you could try getting a fringe and maybe going a bit shorter...if you like lol :)|`|uAzToWC7aa	wear black eyeliner. black-shiny eyeshadow. wear pink lipgloss. straighten ur hair. wear skinny jeans or other clothes. wear graphic shirts or jackets. i know u probably think that thats how punks dress but u would look AWESOME and thats not being a punk. anyway, i hope i helped you out.|`|xb2Y2hMvaa	hahahaha... "I am pretty awesome." lol :)<br>  anyway...<br>  you should try straightening your hair and using eyeliner. also wear sophisticated clothes. this might help the guys know that you're older.<br>  good luck!|`|J6Ak3DxQaa	Probably because you are conceited. Ever though of that? && you aren't a cutie. Sorry.|`|BT7t8aWaaa	Yeah stop being too conceited and saying your a cutie.<br>  Because the first picture almost made me throw up.<br>  I'm not trying to be rude, but seriously..
FhcKeMIGaa	I wear them everywhere... work, dinner, parties.  Find a pair that's comfy or get those inserts to help!|`|UBm8AnO5aa	i wear them when going out 4 a meal and shopping u get used 2 them and they dont hurt. wear jelly insoles for extra comfort.|`|pHTSL3Ylaa	i wear them everywhere|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	The only place is to church, or out to a nice place to eat, a fashion show or even on a date. Why would you even buy them if you can't think of where to wear them?
s5sPny97aa	i'm guessing that the heat will sooth your skin and open your pores, allowing the scrubbing beads to thoroughly clean your skin.<br>  the nut oil should moisturise your face., and the ash should get rid of impurities.<br>  <br>  hope that's helped and good luck!

ecVzWiUJaa	I think a nose piercing would be fine, but since you are a pretty girl then i think the nose piercing would just be sort of distracting to your face.

uH28xTcbaa	use twezeers at home its better and it looks more natural<br>  and I didnt asked my mom, I did it and thats it, I know its the worst advice ever  but If you do it later your mom cant do anything bout it
AA11461724	you're so pretty it makes me sick lol just kidding but i think it's really pretty ... you could lighten up all of your hair first then get highlights over a new color, since your hair is really dark. i think maybe a medium golden brown or even a light golden brown with light blonde highlights would look really good on you. i say golden 'cause you have warm/tan skin and it would work really well with your skin tone. red wouldn't look right on you anyway. good luck!|`|0AQF8pnKaa	blonde/brown hair does not look good with people with your skin tone. idk what it is with people dyeing their hair when it looks fine.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	Well it looks like you already have your mind set so just go with blonde.  It will look good on you.  But don't go super platinum, go sort of a honey blonde, it will look great.|`|UJHKyg7kaa	I would do light brown highlights all over,  not BLONDE. Blonde and dark hair does not look pretty. The last picture looks the best. The first pic of you is kind of strange, but you look really pretty in the second picture and i love your hair color!|`|mPsNadNUaa	i wouldn't do anything with your hair i luv it how it is any you know howe to style it just right too i guess you should go with the honey blond|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	Do it take the pics to you stylist|`|O3U7aLCDaa	The 1st pic with highlights is gorgeous and would look great on u!  Go for it!|`|Y0WSB4C2aa	omg you're so pretty.<br>  <br>  since you have darrrrkkkk hair and are looking for just highlights i think you should go for like a brown highlight or maybe even dye your hair like a shade of brown and see how it looks. but stay away from anything that says "ash" in the color because it will have a red undertone and shade :) goodluck!|`|1fkLC96Vaa	let me start off by sayingg damm gurl you finee as hell..i think you should get the one in the middle..you mayy look good in any color higlights|`|we2Csi51aa	ummmmm blondes nice but im a redhead and i personally think red hair is unique. watch what you say you may come off wrong to others.|`|e489ymwhaa	u look like jessica burciaga....i think u can pull off the look<br>  but u look exotic with ur hair color lyk that|`|SiaRRMJ2aa	Yeah i think thats really nice and that it will suit ure dark hair .|`|Av2dBJ3Uaa	wow your pretty and um the 2nd one|`|Or6mIS96aa	umm... you should get blonde or aubry they would look cute!!!|`|3ZnjKIuAaa	hey. holy your pretty! i love your makeup in the second pic just keep it light! and i love your lipgloss what kind is it? haha sory for the questions.  i think you should stay with the darker hair but some  medium brown highlights would look nice.. if you do decide to get these highlights heres some more pics(its chrystina from girlicious)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://profile.ak.facebook.com/object3/1285/93/l17865802986_8709.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://profile.ak.facebook.com/object3/1...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://s290.photobucket.com/albums/ll277/cathyl322/?action=view&current=Chrystina-sayers-girlicious.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s290.photobucket.com/albums/ll277...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://i325.photobucket.com/albums/k377/nNMejia/chrys3.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i325.photobucket.com/albums/k377/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.contactmusic.com/pics/l/mtv_trl_300408/mtv_1845144.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.contactmusic.com/pics/l/mtv_t...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://41.img.v4.skyrock.net/410/only-girlicious/pics/1949771209_1.gif" rel="nofollow">http://41.img.v4.skyrock.net/410/only-gi...</a><br>  <br>  lol ya and theres more pics just type in girlicious:P|`|sybbEjSNaa	Well, you are acting as if you already know what you want...<br>  <br>  I was going to say get a dark red it would look really good on it until I read what you wrote....<br>  <br>  Anyways....<br>  <br>  I think the last three are worse than you hair color now, it looks REALLY fake. But, I guess all highlights are sort of like that...<br>  <br>  Just go for the thing you want.<br>  <br>  And my favorite was the 2nd one ^_^|`|APU2WRihaa	i think that you should leave you hair the color it is and just get golden highlights
bq1R7TATaa	Maybe something you are using (including laundry soap, fabric softener etc..) is not mixing with you body <br>  chemistry right.  Try perfume free products. Does your house have a clean smell? Alot of times its hard to tell your own house stinks until you get somewhere else and can smell it on you.  It could be your diet as well.  You will have to do a lot of experimenting to find the cause. You will just have to start eliminating things one by one until you figure it out.|`|3FRy850uaa	I would listen and eat less or no curry if possible because almost everyone who eats it smells a little now and then (not sure why, but is true) and dont listen to people who say to bring perfume and deodorant with you. If you smell bad and add perfume the smell will just become worst, you cant mix good with bad.|`|SS87lbOCaa	bring perfume with you to school|`|e25149c4b92661e23727bb5ebba001f7aa	what part of you stinks?|`|H6I0vEoWaa	Deodorant <br>  Lack Of Health (Junk Food / Fast Food / Oily Food)<br>  Also if you eat lots of garlic/curry it seeps through your pores ..<br>  Lack Of Brushing / Flossing / Mouth Washing|`|Mtv2WRBlaa	i suggest you wash yourself better. and when you put on perfume, dont put on too much. deodorant will also help.|`|XK1Kf7mnaa	eat less curry it makes you smell cause it flows through the body and expells itself through your pores!|`|uDleWWlcaa	bring stuff with you.
UkWXO9gXaa	definetly the 1st one <br>  no offense 2nd one looks like a guy|`|bEypuYJ0aa	girl 2 has realllly pretty skin.|`|wdFwirb4aa	I think the first one is pretty.|`|Oti6JXJIaa	i think they are both really pretty i think the first girl needs some lipgloss though cause her lips look really chapped and maybe some color and the second girl needs to part her hair a differnt way no offence but it kinda looks weird on her.|`|EkZDP3Oyaa	They are both pretty in completely different ways.  I would choose number 1|`|RSv2E2KNaa	Neither but 2nd one is better.|`|ZvLmuCiOaa	the second one.|`|nidCgr73aa	You both are equally pretty, I can't choose. Oh and the second girl has the same phone as me (Samsung Tocco) which takes amazing pictures by the way.<br>  <br>  Ask your friend (the second girl) to maybe consider moving her parting over a bit towards her left. She has a small comb-over, you know what bald men try and do? I used to have one then I realized.

I remember I answered first! <br>  Anyways, still, definitely the second girl.|`|zhWdG63Baa	i like the second one but i don't like the hair on both pics|`|UWK2ZERDaa	BOTH are very cute<br>  but i hate when girls have their bangs like that [2nd pic]<br>  why r u trying to cover up ur face so much? big forehead? stop.<br>  therefore #1 can pull off the bob and is very cute :)|`|634jf1L4aa	The second girl.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	im sorry but i dont think either are pretty|`|DWYELEQIaa	Both pictures are equally unattractive not because the girls aren't pretty but for two completely different reasons: <br>  <br>  1.

They are pointless. People should not ask who is prettier. It's not right to put two ppl against each other, if you want my honest opinion I would say they are both pretty.|`|lDMDCBNKaa	Both are sorta pretty. The second one has pretty hair. The first one has a pretty face.|`|KIGzbUOlaa	Tbh, i think the first one is ugly, her lips are awful. <br>  The second girl looks stunning & to have natural beauty.|`|3ikqgComaa	neither. but the girl in the second photo needs to not part her hair so far. she looks manly.|`|kgwnel4faa	omg the 2nd 1|`|e489ymwhaa	2nd pic|`|6xUmhIxPaa	both ugly whores.|`|z1oFNgYFaa	Second girl(:|`|B0jINMrsaa	ewww.the second one looks like a guy!!!|`|CKKisY5Aaa	the first one|`|JFdcuYAkaa	they are the same

xiX1xIAhaa	There probably wont be a Sallys in a shopping centre but there probably will be an Xtras there. I know there is one in a couple of centres near me. I always get my hair from there. You can buy a big pack that is at least two heads worth of hair, or maybe more depending on how thick your own hair is for really cheap compared to other places. They do loads of different colours and lengths too.<br>  They also do extensions with clips already attached, if you're looking for clip-ins.|`|0TEvBSQyaa	Definatly go to a place called Sallys! They are the best, and have all the hairdressing needs.<br>  They have extensions in dirty blonde but they do cost a lot though.<br>  They are veryyyy realistic though!|`|jKQ5UAVWaa	i got some clip in hair extensions from a shop called sally anne hair & beauty or sally hair and beauty i cant rememberr the name. they cost about 35 pound for 3 lots but i only use two. u can wash them and use straighteners on them because its human hair. just ask a women in the shop to see what colour is nearest to your colour if thereisn'tt one dye them the same colour has your hair. it says they cant be dyed but i dyed mine and their fine. there is also a shop calledd shear beauty. try going on the websites to see the nearest store to you. they are called american dream hair extensions.definitelyy a good buy!!

i38Ev1Zaaa	it really sounds like your iron isn't hot enough.<br>  <br>  if you get a cheaper iron, your hair isn't going to curl as quickly, and its going to fall out quicker.<br>  <br>  I recommend you use a HOT TOOLS brand curling iron. They're about 20-30 dollars, but they're honestly worth it. They last for years, and they curl your hair quickly, and the curls stay in:<br>  <a href="http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1012.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.folica.com/Hot_Tools_Profe_d1...</a><br>  <br>  if your on a budget, you can also check out WIGO:<br>  <a href="http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productDetail.jsp?skuId=2165513&productId=xlsImpprod810204&navAction=push&navCount=1&categoryId=cat1000003" rel="nofollow">http://www.ulta.com/ulta/browse/productD...</a><br>  <br>  to curl your hair, you just need to get the technique down.<br>  <br>  Apply about 2 palmfuls of curling mousse to your hair (More or less depending on how thick your hair is). Brush the mousse evenly throughout your hair, and let it air dry or quickly blowdry it while brushing just to let the mousse dry.<br>  <br>  Grab a 1 inch section of hair, and then grab the curling iron. Since your hair is thick and hard to curl, you should put it on the higher heat settings. Run the iron halfway down the strand of hair, and start curling. If you pull the iron all the way to the end and then start curling, the bottom will curl but the top won't, leaving you with frizzy curls, fried ends and that clamp mark.<br>  <br>  Repeat until your whole head is finished, then let them cool.<br>  <br>  After the curls are cooled COMPELTELY style your hair with bobby pins and such, then finish it off with a hard hold hairspray.<br>  <br>  It'll take a few times to master, but you'll get used to it!|`|RHtFUsgjaa	I have curly hair. What i use to define the curls and make them stay longer and hold them in place is making waves by graham webb <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.grahamwebb.com/images/WAVES_gel.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.grahamwebb.com/images/WAVES_g...</a><br>  <br>  its amazing it hold them all day!!! My hair is the same as yours.. more wavy then curly and if you want curly (which i did) you should totally buy this it GIVES you curls!|`|rRiYmn7Aaa	I have fine hair, but a lot of it. It also has a natural wave to it. What I do is wash my hair in the evening or night and leave it to where it's almost dry but is still SLIGHTLY damp. Then I put in two french braids into my hair and hairspray the braids. I sleep in the braids, and in the morning I hair spray the braids again and leave it in while I do my make up or eat breakfast and what not. Then I untie the braids and hair spray my hair again. They're not exactly curls, but they're boarder-line curls and very wavy. It takes me maybe about a max of 10 minutes at night and 10 minutes in the morning, but then again my hair is 26 inches long. It's not something to do if you're in a hurry in the morning, but it may be something to try.|`|6uZ0VHFTaa	Have your hair professionally thinned out. It is probably too thick. Curl it with hot rollers or curling iron. Don't brush or comb all the curl out. Run your fingers through your hair and spray to set curl.|`|KtlARuAhaa	After u curl your hair, use an extreme hold hairspray on it.....trust me|`|MaqNfnEfaa	Use paul mitchell products|`|DP6rRSxraa	Use curl defining shampoo and conditioner..<br>  <br>  When curling, do it in sections, that way you can use hairspray on each section..<br>  I use either Aussie or Nicky Clarke hairspray.<br>  <br>  Also, brushing your hair will brush out the curls, so try to leave it unbrushed when you've finished.. :)

KVFYJrDJaa	From the perspective of a guy and from the perspective of someone who watches too much America's Next Top Model, that first picture with you in the parka is totally awesome. Very artistic and you look very... exotic, I guess. <br>  <br>  The second picture is just a very pretty girl, except your eyes are absolutely captivating. I think that is something you can work on to make you stand out in the crowd. <br>  <br>  Height is important, to be certain, but at least you're not 5' 2". Height can hold you back in modeling. <br>  <br>  And please don't take this the wrong way, because I think you look great, but clients who hire models will want you to be way skinnier. Personally whenever I see a crack-ho skinny model I want to feed her a double cheeseburger and a shake and come chili cheese fries. It's just unnatural. But if you want to be in the biz, fully plan to always need to lose weight. <br>  <br>  I wish you the best and I hope your dreams become reality!|`|kUhcypC9aa	You need to send 2 natural shots to as many agencies as you can. One head shot and one full body shot. They should not be professional pictures. Or set aside a day to visit as many agencies as you can. Be prepared to be turned away though, Its just another part of the industry. Good luck :) x|`|0b719092b4d69772e046d90f96e26879aa	I think you look too average.|`|c4e154794e4bfc9851f35d0bb724236caa	Uh no...........maybe catalog modeling.....and some better pics would've helped|`|1ScInnZRaa	You're ok, but unless you are 5'10, no chance|`|qNOeBcvraa	give it a shot!!!!!!!!|`|HDhETFc3aa	You do not look unique, at all. There isn't anything model like about you.Sorry.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It does not matter how you wear your makeup, a model needs to look sensational with out any make up at all, when you go to castings, you will be asked not to wear heavy make up, or sometimes any make up at all. <br>  The very minimum height you should be is 5'7, however the shorter girls need to be even skinnier to make up for lack of height. However, most people hire our taller models. <br>  You are sweet looking, but you also just look like every other girl in the street. You don't inspire me, and thats what a model needs to do. <br>  Sorry, Focus on being a lawyer, because I am being cruel to be kind, you won't make it.|`|iLiD8MEKaa	1. The pictures are bad as well as the angles in the pictures. The first picture has been edited WAY too much and you are wearing too much makeup in the other pictures. Modeling agencies DO NOT CARE how well you can do your own makeup, they aren't looking for makeup artists, they're looking for models and they want to see what you really look like...they want a "blank canvas" so to speak. <br>  <br>  2. Modeling isn't about being "pretty"..that's what we have beauty pageants for. You have to have what the agency wants. All agencies look for a different look, so some might not take you if you're not what they're looking for...but again, they all look for something different. <br>  <br>  3. It depends on what type of modeling you want to do. <br>  Runway/High Fashion modeling: Depends on who you are doing a runway show for. All designers/clients look for something different. Usually, the requirements are that you be at least 5'8 or more and you have the certain look that the person you are working for is looking for. You're 13...I'm pretty sure that you will grow a few more inches, but other than that there is no way to make yourself taller other than heels. <br>  <br>  Commercial/Catalog/Print modeling: They usually take all shapes, heights, and sizes. However, the people you are working for will all look for something different depending on who you're working for and what you're modeling for. <br>  <br>  3. Make yourself a portfolio. Take pictures of yourself with no makeup, hair pulled back off your face, and a plain tshirt/jeans with heels. Take a picture of your face straight on, one shot of your profile, and a body shot. Don't make any stupid poses or faces..just a nice smile. Nothing crazy. <br>  <br>  4. Take your porfolio to an agency and see if they want to hire you. When you go to see the agency, don't wear flashy clothing. Wear a fitted, solid color t-shirt or tank top, plain fitted jeans, and heels. Wear your hair pulled back into a ponytail or off your face. Wear no makeup. Don't act like a diva, be friendly, polite, and patient.|`|1KLMxjMlaa	HAHAHAHA funny but racoons cant be models!!!!! hahaha take off the make up and grow a little more and probablly|`|q7mActnmaa	You posted a "am i pretty" <br>  or whatever question yesterday.<br>  <br>  Yes you are pretty.<br>  <br>  -Cass|`|mcomAA2eaa	You are pretty but hard to tell what you look like without all the makeup.|`|p3GZERIsaa	Your Just Average Looking...

(its an american store, so idk.)|`|mAZi1eH7aa	Old Navy is a good place to get some. Typically $30 or less and reasonably good quality. A variety of styles. Zellers carries various brands and styles at great prices. Sears carries a lot, but the price is higher and the quality is good, but no better than the others. <br>  You can go to the specialty shops and pay a lot more, but the quality may not be any better. If you do that, you may not have enough for even one pair.<br>  If you have a Giant Tiger store near you, they quite often have a good selection at great prices. They buy end of line lots of branded clothes (not end of style / end of line, which means the end of that months production, only) and sell them at bulk prices. You would be surprised at what they carry.<br>  Marks Work Wearhouse has a large selection of very durable jeans.<br>  The Superstores that have a clothing section carry a lot of styles too, at good prices.<br>  If you like the broken in look and want quite a few pairs for very little and have lots of money left over, go to Value Vliiage. I bought 2 pairs of new, with tags still on them, jeans, there last month for $12. Very high quality (designer).<br>  Lots of choices.|`|L9b7sUbFaa	well depends on if youre more of a designer jean person or er more normal...i love designer jeans and i think its totally worth it to have at least one pair<br>  <br>  but you must have at least 5 pairs of jeans(espically if you wear them practically every day) <br>  <br>  <br>  hope that helped!|`|EnYLhQajaa	I live in Canada also, and my favourite jean stores are American Eagle, and Campus crew, both priced around $30-60<br>  <br>  Here is American Eagle's website...<br>  <a href="http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_full_fashion_guide.jsp?catId=cat90120" rel="nofollow">http://www.ae.com/web/browse/category_fu...</a>|`|Gyim2HTIaa	go to dillards or macys or jcpeenys|`|ebZ9e9FPaa	pacsun has a 2 for $55 jean sale. idk if they have pacsun in canada. also, they have a lot of their jeans on sale for $14.99.

The price range is any where from $10.00 - $80.00. (about) Aeropostale probably has the cheapest jeans but they are still really good quality. You should probably get around 2-5 more pairs of jeans.

vZ0Ml4FVaa	something long always looks good!it is very slimming!i know Deb or Kohl's stores usually have flattering outfits|`|XTfr3uKQaa	It's hard to say what specific fashions...just look for things that flatter your body. Wear shirts that arent too short and that go to your hips. Wear darker colours to make you look slimmer but add colourful accessories!<br>  Wear flared pants, with waits that go just below your belly button to hold in your waist..and the flare will even out your body  more and make your legs look slimmer. <br>  Don't wear skinny jeans.<br>  Don't wear tube tops.<br>  Wear pumps to make your legs look longer and slimmer.<br>  Wear dresses and jackets that cinch in at the waist. Try wearing wide belts, and skinny belts.<br>  <br>  And an alternative to losing weight is just try toning up a bit with some strength training, yoga, pilates, stuff like that. This will help give your body a better shape and you will look better in your clothing. It will fim up your butt and bring in your belly more to give you a more feminine, curvy, toned body.|`|DeQsKdmSaa	If you wear heels, wear wide heels. It will help balance out your frame more. I've seen cute pairs at 5.7.9.<br>  Vertical stripes are very slimming, as is the color black. You can find just about anything black and white striped at Hot Topic.<br>  When you wear handbags, wear larger ones. For instance, there is a lavender Melie Bianco purse that would be fantastic.<br>  Try high-waisted jeans and something with a cute belt around your waist (NOT your hips, your waist. common mistake.)<br>  I'm not sure if they come in plus sizes, but there is a pair of Dollhouse jeans (harem style) that might look good on you.<br>  :)

I'd say your best bet for a cheaper "copy-cat" version is New Look or Faith. However this is a relatively new design so it may take a while for the "drip effect" to take affect in the chain store industry (sorry just the way it is!).

4ew4ogH8aa	its not commonly done here<br>  you will probably stick out as "the hat lady" <br>  and you will also probably be referred to by others as "the lady in the hat"<br>  you will also probably look old, yes <br>  <br>  So, I would reccommend not wearing one. Why cover your beautiful hair anyway? ^^|`|icFcfLJJaa	In the U.S., people don't commonly wear hats to the wedding.

You could wear a full ballet get-up complete with "toe shoes" and it wouldn't matter.  <br>  <br>  And by the way, good for you, for being involved in such a helpful and selfless organization, at 15, I'm sure it's hard, especially in today's world to do the right thing.

Did you try cleaning it. I'm not sure if you can take it out yet, but if not take the balls off one at a time and clean them with peroxide, then put a cap full of peroxide on both the top and bottom of your piercing. If it isn't better in a day or two you may have to take it out.
0WtYbYeUaa	they are good clothes but you have to be careful of what you buy. A lot of my shirts tend to get holes at the bottom. The jeans are really good. i have so many that i bought like 4 years ago that are still in good shape. but it can be expensive if you don't have the money for it. anyways you should atleast buy a few things and decide for yourself  :)|`|M4fOvFQtaa	it depends on how you take care of them, if you dont fold them neatly and wear them like everyday, never wash them then they will rip, and wrinkle fast. if you do take care of them they will last longer.....i have been shopping in abercrombie and hollister for soo long and i like the clothes but i still do think that its a little expensive for me.|`|Bd2mKZkAaa	The prices are outrageously expensive! I mean A+F has like a $70 tank top. PLus theyre not really good quality, all thin and such, plus the really plain tank tops rip! I guess ppl buy the label bc the clothes arent great only they look really cool|`|SqpzHmZQaa	yes i have ton of clothes from them from like along and they still look good|`|eDP3YU5Laa	Dont shop there! Those stores SUCK ***!<br>  Im sorry but its the truth!|`|rYX6Owfraa	NOOOOOO. dont buy clothes from there. the clothes are not good quality and its way too expensive.  its not worth it at all. i personally think everything from those stores are ugly too.|`|KxqEYBWhaa	some of it is. i shop at both stores and i have some shirts that i've had for years and then there's some shirts, that i'm not kidding, had holes in them after the first wash. The jeans are really good quality but they are a little pricey. Hollister has more reasonable prices and their clothes is cuter. And when they have sales they have good sales!|`|mD4Xn3jNaa	it is the shittiest quality of clothing ever<br>  a lot of the clothes are THIN and SHITTY!<br>  it's also very expensive<br>  go to their website infact<br>  <br>  all they do is stitch on a seagull or whatever and make it look cool|`|SIdhw9hlaa	umm i personally dont like the brand because i think they only make there clothes look good on white teens...<br>  <br>  anyways there quality is pretty good, just as with any other designer|`|qzkWahFeaa	They are nice quality (Hollister clothes are so soft!). I think some prices are too high, but others are pretty decent. Try the clearance if you want.

VdwAasA6aa	There is shampoo that helps hair to be more moist and you may also want to try something like CHI straight guard before you straighten it. It keeps your hair stable to tempters up to something or another I cant remember but that is what I use and I straighten my hair two times a day and it is still soft and unfried and when it does fry it I get some kind of hair medicine that you can buy at CVS that brings back lushness hope I helped|`|g5iQVY1Zaa	Yer gonna need a really good hair mask/conditioner. Pantene makes a good one.<br>  <br>  Also, use a protective cream/gel before straightening; like Hask Pure Shine Polishing Serum or Hask Pure Shine Suddenly Straight.|`|ps3GTuO2aa	im like that too,<br>  but what i use as of now is <br>  BigSEXYHair. <br>  And well they sell all types of products for straiughtnening,<br>  curlying, and shampoo and conditioner,<br>  but the brand it self is expensive its like<br>  $20 for a little teasing hairpsary,<br>  Heres the link take alook,<br>  and then come back to read the rest of my answer:<br>  <a href="http://www.sexyhair.com/big.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.sexyhair.com/big.htm</a><br>  <br>  SO yeah thats the website.<br>  ANd well that will really help your hair,<br>  if you have thee money.<br>  Hope i helped, and got 10 points:]|`|Ta7snyIoaa	Well guess what , you HAVE to stop straightening it at least for a LITTLE while or else your hair will get completely destroyed.<br>  Get a hair cut, and depending on the length take off at least an inch. Use a deep conditioner EVERY WEEK and if possibly let your hair air dry before straightening. Use a heat protectant and whenever you can don't straighten your hair.
7hIwM2jzaa	Start by blow drying your hair upsidedown (gives loasda volume).<br>  Straighten it (mainly just the ends and fringe or the front of your hair.<br>  Then from just over 1/4 of the way down the back seperate your hair in to 2 parts (so the bottom half is left down and the top part is clipped up)<br>  then peice by peice take small peices of the hair clipped up, combe it through then spray a small amount of hairspray near the root, and then from about 1.5 - 2.5 inches away from your scalp back combe it a few times. (backcombing is where you come towards your scalp instead of down to the ends) <br>  Keep doing this at the back/top of your head until you reach the desired effect, and wellllllaaaaa!  scene hair!<br>  <br>  if you look on youtube im sure you will find countless amounts of videos on how to do it|`|GTYYogMNaa	if you need extensions<br>  <a href="http://horrorkidz.com/" rel="nofollow">http://horrorkidz.com/</a><br>  Ive ordered from them several times, and no one can compare to them. <br>  they are just amazing!<br>  <br>  ive tried etsy, hairhxc and hottopic. lol and i personally think horrorkidz is the best quality you can get.|`|WImLNgbYaa	My hair is a little past shoulder length and my layers start an inch and a half from the roots, which makes it good to backcomb.<br>  I use 18inch extensions, but that's just to make my hair look better cause my hair is rubbish i reckon.<br>  But using extensions, pulls down on your hair, making them grow faster and when backcombing, makes the hair look better.<br>  And for teasing it, don't use your fingers. That is a very back diea.<br>  Always use a comb, and tilt your head upside down and backcomb it that way. Then when finished, you'll lift up your head and it will turn out all over the place.<br>  Just flatten it down a little then comb back up until your satisfied.<br>  Then spray hairspray, but not a lot, it will damage it easier. Just spray a little on them tease it<br>  But don't comb it or anything when the hairspray has dried, because that will cause serious damage later on.
JoAC0p80aa	I think it'll look cute on you.<br>  Just not the color.<br>  Stay with your natural hair color. <br>  But the cut would be totally cute =)<br>  Work it girl lol|`|Grl27Kptaa	The hairstyle you posted would look really cute. I dunno if you are dying it that way too but if you decide too it would look really great because of your light skin tone. :) God luck!|`|yrwq0gNcaa	Yes but make it the same color in the picture of that other person too!|`|Fv9SC6zRaa	i think it would suit you not sure about the colour but the cut would. you have a similar shaped face to me and i cut my hair like that a few months ago and it looked really good!<br>  <br>  ps you spell would like that not wood...<br>  :D|`|lDMDCBNKaa	OMG!!!

AA11461724	they will either bleach your hair or strip the color. either way, it's going to take a very long time. they leave it on until your hair is a very pale yellow (not orange, orange isn't light enough) then they will either dye over the pale yellow with the color you want or tone over the pale yellow to achieve a light ash blonde. who are you going to? the last time i went to a pro i had medium/dark brown hair with a red highlight and i wanted my hair medium/dark ash blonde and she told me it couldn't be done without killing my hair. she put some bleach on it for a little while till it was light orange then dyed over it with a golden blonde color and it turned out light strawberry blonde. it looked good but it was weird. about a year after that my hair was dyed light brown and i bleached it myself and got light blonde hair and it wasn't that damaged. i'm telling you this 'cause who you go to might tell you that what you want can't be done. the chick i went to hadn't even heard of color remover, what should be used on you. just call around before you settle on a stylist and good luck!|`|154dzJ1Faa	First, by definition, "dye" means to only darken, never make light.  You can only make things darker with dye, and never blonde!  Dye is generally only used on fabrics but not on hair, although some kids use dyes (they just don't know any better).<br>  <br>  To get your hair lighter, you need to lighten (or bleach) your hair.  That is to remove the colour pigments from your hair.  Usually, after they are removed (and gone forever), you will add a light shade that you wanted.<br>  <br>  Highlights are only strands of hair bleached, and may look good, but not light on very dark hair.  That is too much like a skunk.  And they are hard to keep up.<br>  <br>  If you were to use a tint (which all contain bleach), you can lift your hair a shade or two, but not enough to a blonde that you want. There are hundreds of different blondes, so be sure you know what you want.  You should have a consultation with a professional hair colourist to decide what you want, if it can be done, alternatives, cost, time, etc.  You need all the facts before doing this.<br>  <br>  From what you have said, I think you will need a two-step process.  First a bleach to a pale yellowish colour and to get rid of the orange, and then the light tint in whatever shade you wanted.  It's not hard to do, but does take time, and can be very scary for a first-timer.  You need to know what is going on and what to do next.  Don't do this yourself -- see a hairdresser, please.  It's cheaper in the long run.|`|RHtFUsgjaa	They will probably do it all in one sitting. It will take long though<br>  <br>  <br>  But if you have brown hair..i really dont think you should go to blonde :S|`|HQmAP5EVaa	They will probably choose the healthiest way to do it which is highlighting. It will take more than one appoitment.. but it will be better for your hair in the long run.|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	They do it all in the same setting, but they will probably do highlights and low lights it looks better more natural..|`|UPfXjUUmaa	I get my hair bleached every 4 weeks. My natural color is dark brown.. the first time i died it it was from a box and i have red undertones from my mom in my hair (genetics) and so it turned my hair a nasty red orange color, it did take a while to undue what i had messed up. When u go to get it professionally done you basically have two chooses, you can do an all over color or you can do a series of highlights and low lights. It really depends on what mix of Color you are looking for. I prefer highlights personally but it does take more than one session to get the color that you want to achieve, then maintaining that color can get expensive. I hope Ive helped some..if you have any more questions about my explanation, feel free to email... Blondebarbie18@sbcglobal.net

9y7xSEinaa	You live near NYC? NYC has a huge Indian and East Asian population; in a neighborhood like Jackson Heights, there are hundreds of places that sell henna and other Indian beauty products. In Northern NJ (where there are thousands of Indians) there are plenty of beauty supply stores that sell henna. You can also find henna in well-stocked beauty supply stores. Do some googling, call around.

That is when they can see your hair, and you; you can ask all these questions (and they are the right questions).  Also ask how often you need to get it re-done, any special care that is required, etc.  You need all the facts before you get started.<br>  <br>  Most salons don't charge for this, but some may ask for a deposit that can be applied to the service if you decide to get it.  They don't have the time to discuss all of this at the time of the appointment, and would rather do it all beforehand on a slower day when they have the time.  They may want to do some strand tests to see if your hair can withstand the process -- some can't be done.  It's best that they know -- and you know -- what to expect. No one likes surprises!  They may need to get special supplies and need time to get them.

Yy6GIHCuaa	unfortunately with the hair that you've described you'll need time and or money. :/ life really does suck sometimes.<br>  i'd buy the paul mitchell super skinny serum. it works great, smells good, and you put it in after a shower, and a little bit after you straighten your hair.<br>  also, try and save up for a really good straightener. you don't want your hair fried or curly. <br>  also, try wearing your hair curly sometimes, like pin it to your head with a bunch of bobby pins. it allows your hair to resurrect itself from dryness.|`|Y0WSB4C2aa	well you could go to your hair dresser and ask them what they think would be the best hair style for you. if your hair isnt too frizzy you should try getting bangs or something to compliment your face. but odds are you will most likely end up buying some hair products. if you want the "beachy" hair since that would look realllllly good with long hair ( i have long hair myself ) you should go for the aussie collection.<br>  <br>  i bought aussie catch the wave mousse + leave-in.<br>  i love it and it's not expensive. it was about 3 or 4 dollars.<br>  <br>  also, if you straighten your hair alot, using hair spray will help with flyaways and keep it tamed and straight. you might also want to invest in a very good straightener. i know theyre expensive but i LOVE my CHI. i paid $90 and i've had it for 2 years. it's my favorite thing ever.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck! :)|`|KuJXcGZTaa	Try a fishtail braid off the side.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.mynewhair.info/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/fishbraid2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.mynewhair.info/wp-content/upl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R73lWv3JPms&feature=channel" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R73lWv3JP...</a><br>  <br>  like that, except off to the side.<br>  <br>  Or try just a side braid.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2008/stylewatch/gallery/star_beauty/080818/fergie.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img2.timeinc.net/people/i/2008/st...</a>|`|24Cz1lItaa	lots of conditioner, straightening balm...do as much as possible without the flat iron it can do serious damage|`|R0Zx8Q8Baa	im srry,you'll prbly have to get a product :( try some theyll rreally help,get out of the shower and just put some in,it doesnt take long at all.also,try buying a better staightner.u could like get a chemical straightening or perm,also. best bet tho is to go out and buy some product,my personal fav. brands are herbal essences,biosilk,john frieda, but try wutever u want.good luck :)|`|gzci7VMiaa	for straightening you could go to a hair salon and have it done professionaly for hairstlye try this:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/shattereddreams/Character%20Pictures/Margarita/Hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v70/sh...</a><br>  <br>  or maybe a french briad but that would probley take to long<br>  its also hard to tell because we dont know what you look like.|`|GhFwXbI4aa	if you want wavy hair like Miley cyrus get ur hair and spray salt water on it and tie it un into a bun for a couple of ours and there that's what someone told me so yer i hope this helps|`|APU2WRihaa	you can do the front hair poof<br>  and if you want to you can put frizz control in your hair|`|TIWYBoSFaa	try this website|`|KWV6ZtBsaa	girl<br>  if you have gourgeous curly hair dont straighten it!<br>  i mean once in a while, but anywayzzz <br>  for frizz control paul mitche producs are AMAZING.<br>  use the super skinny smoothing serum shampoo and<br>  after you get out of the shower<br>  use<br>  Paul Mitchell leave in coditioner and let your hair dry|`|e33d8d3e0ec2509a9d2f30e691a5c124aa	no sorry

H6rPxpHWaa	Start making your own products and home remedies for dark circles under the eyes, and see the difference it can make in you life. The e-book will be here, in your computer ready to give you step by step instructions on how make your preparations. Don’t forget to pay extra attention to the areas in the book marked as TIPs, they are a fountain of secrets, tips, statistics and amazing information. <br>  <br>  Should you have any questions, remember that you can contact me using my personal email address.<br>  <br>  <br>  The remedies listed below are the ones most people know about, some of them are very useful if you have dark circles under the eyes. <br>  <br>  <br>  ?Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #1: Drink at least ten glasses of water everyday. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #1: Dark circles may be hereditary for some people or simply a part of the aging process, but most people would agree that they are a struggle to conceal. When the fat pad beneath the eye begins to thin with age, it can create a sunken look to the under eye area. Studies have shown that sluggishness of blood flow underneath the eyes may also contribute to dark circles. Vitamin K has been found to diminish the appearance of these dark circles. A recent study published in Cosmetic and Toiletries, included two groups, one that applied an under eye cream containing sunscreen and another that applied an under eye cream containing a combination of vitamin K and retinol. An examination of the under eye color at the beginning of the study and at the end found a significant lightening in the group using the vitamin K and retinol combination. <br>  <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #1: Eight hours of sleep is a must for all of us, especially for people having dark circles under their eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #2: Close your eyes and cover your eyelids with slices of raw potato or cucumber for 15-20 minutes. Wash with warm water and apply a cream. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #3: Grate a cucumber, squeeze to take out its juice and refrigerate. Make a mixture of lemon juice, lanolin cream and cucumber juice and apply around the eye for 10-15 minutes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #4: Apply lemon juice on the black circles 2 times a day. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #5: Apply a paste of turmeric powder with pineapple juice for dark circles under the eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #6: Apply crushed mint around the eye. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #7: Apply almond oil under eyes. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #8: Reduce your intake of vitamin A. Over dose of medications such as Retin A produces "excessive" vascularization. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #9: Niacinamide, a derivative of the vitamin Niacin, has been shown to be an effective skin lightening agent, especially for skin conditions where hyperpigmention may occur on the face or other visible parts of the body. Patients with hyperpigmentation applied a moisturizer containing five percent niacinamide. After four weeks, the hyperpigmentation and skin color were analyzed by computer and most patients experienced decreased hyperpigmentation and increased skin lightness. Topical niacinamide has also been shown to have anti-inflammatory properties, which makes it a potential treatment for puffy eyes and dark circles. <br>  <br>  ??Home Remedies for Dark circles under the eyes #10: Almond helps to remove dark circles and is an excellent "skin food". Remove the cream applied around the eye after 10 min. No cream should be left on the skin around the eyes for long periods.|`|4c0922d0720002c72a057eee42f94715aa	I had these for about 4 months.So here you go :<br>  Need:<br>  <br>  Flour<br>  Orange Juice<br>  Honey<br>  <br>  Procedure:<br>  <br>  Mix the 3 ingredients together. Make sure that you have more amount of flour because its what makes it silky and have texture. Freeze it for a few minutes but if your orange juice is cold you dont really have too. Rub it on the edges of your circles for 10- 15 minutes. NOTE: This would not remove the whole thing it would just lighten and reduce it.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't help, i ran across a short article at www.heelsncoffee.com about a product IQ Derma have.There's a free sample you can order . Maybe that will help.

I also know where you could find some tips. if you go to a beauty store or a hair store look at their magazines and they have lots of different hair styles for long, short, and medium. you should check it out some time. good luck on you hair im sorry if i could not give you that much information at least i tried.|`|mmVQs1ymaa	herbal treatment is very good enough for any kind of hair problems.  so it is advised to go to nearest herbal store.
