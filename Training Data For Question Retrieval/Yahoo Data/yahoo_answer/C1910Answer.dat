10af4993fcb827d6fabb27f05cba2be5aa	All you really need to do is use a switch in place of the the DI-524. The original router can handle the IP's. Just set all computers to the same IP range and workgroup, use a switch and your done.    DHCP will also work, but the second router is causing your issues.  If you need to "rebroadcast" at the second location, turn off the DHCP in the 524 and connect the EnGenius "Bridge" to a LAN port, don't use the WAN/Internet port - instant "repeater".  (be sure to change the IP of the 524 to something other than x.x.x.1 so you don't conflict with the MAIN routers IP!    -- Edit-- Be sure to use the SAME RANGE on both routers. If your linksys is using 192.168.1.x  use 192.168.1.x on the second one also,, just don't use 192.168.1.1 anywhere on the second system!

Put it in your CD drive and then restart your computer.  When your computer boots, its should boot from the CD drive and then program will load and "shred" all files on your hard drive.     If it doesnt boot off the CD the first try, restart your computer again and there should be a button like "press f12 for boot sequence" at the very start of when you turn your computer on.  Press that and choose your CD drive.    Good luck!
U9n960GYaa	To tell you the truth... I've used it a few times in the past and it didn't slow mine down at all, but I'm running 64 bit Vista with a 2.66 quad-core with 8GB's of RAM so it would be hard for me to tell if it slows you down or not.  I guess it all depends on the configuration of your system..    BE FOREWARNED....Frostwire is considered by many experts to be one of the leading sites for viruses/malware.  I never go there anymore...    Any P2P site that you use will most likely be full of malware... I don't reccomend any of them... but if I did choose to use one..Frostwire would be my choice...      GOOD LUCK !!!|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Yes if you use it to download many files at the same time, it will take all your bandwidth and use all your processes slowing you down big time.

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like adware.    If you have an anti-virus, make sure it has the latest virus definitions and run a scan with it in Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking.  That often prevents malware from protecting itself.  If you dont have one, many people here swear by AVG (its free).     I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (theyre free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesnt seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode.     Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.    Good luck.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|LPxJRQuLaa	You've most likely gotten some AdWare on your computer. If the same site keeps popping up, or the same company owning the sites, search Google for info on how to remove that company from your computer, preferably from another computer.    If it isn't the same, it's best to do a System Restore to a few days or weeks before this started happening.

It depends on the drive itself.|`|Mo6ddqx2aa	Yes an external drive will give you more space for memory.

RAM will certainly improve performance, allowing you to load programs faster as well as run more programs simultaneously.  in that respect, it should allow you to burn while having other programs open.|`|18cf3783a2afe133792892d1ff86ec1daa	yeah it ok...you can store other files(mp3,movies,software) at external hard drive...it make your laptop more free space  or  you can buy new laptop hard drive with large capacity(etc 300 GB) then replace it...     about burning process if you buy more ram it can improve at buffer data but at write data...if you want it write at high speed you need drive with high speed write (etc 52x or else above)

It works better than VGA for connecting to big-screen HDTVs.    Good luck.    EDITED TO ADD:    Use a DVI-to-HDMI cable ONLY IF your computer also has a DVI output.  DVI is digital and tends to work better for connecting to an HDTV than VGA, which is analog.  If your computer only has a VGA output, then you are restricted to connecting to the HDTV's VGA port.|`|2YsKHSpkaa	Im not an expert on TV's, but  I believe you have to have a VGA to HDMI cable.

I think it is a good thing that you add a message, it slightly shows what kind of person you are, from the way of typing the words or the language you use.

FBQZ06vraa	That sounds like a trial version of Microsoft Office that was good for 25 uses or 60 days.  At the end of that time it stops letting you edit your files or create new ones.  You have to purchase Microsoft Office 2007, or at least Word 2007, to do that.    Like being hooked like a fish, isn't it?    Note:  The 25-character product key on the computer case or laptop bottom is NOT the key for MS Office.  Its only for the Windows operating system.    If you have files that are locked up in the new Word 2007 file format (.docx), heres a possibility for salvaging them.  Microsoft offers a free Compatibility pack that allows earlier versions of Word to read Word 2007 files.  If you have access to an earlier version, this can at least give you back your documents.  Some new features of Word 2007 will be lost or converted to straight text in the conversion to the earlier version.    On the other hand, if youre interested in buying Word, check out this URL, especially the second group of listings.     http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/produc...    Note that the higher of the two prices quoted is for a full version of that program and the lower, for upgrades from existing software.  Read the list of upgrade-qualifying software carefully:  MS Works is often one, and may have come on your machine.    Further, if you're a student, you may qualify for the Student edition of Office at a pretty good price:    http://www.microsoft.com/student/discoun...    Good luck.|`|cfn8mYF6aa	if u are trying tto edit someone's work then it wont work because they locked it.    if u open it and try to type something new on a BLANK document and it wont work its probableey bcuz your free trial period is up. thats what happend to me.

fb1a57ed0e8097a66606d3a50ae0a779aa	I wouldn't really reccomend running a website from your home computer, especially one that serves up videos. First of all, your internet most likely has an IP(internet protocol) address that changes, so if you were to buy a domain name like myvideos.com, you would not be able to tie it to the website from your computer. It is possible, but is very unreliable and would probably seem unprofessional. If you are looking for cheap hosting, I would recommend http://byethost.com/ hosting with a free domain name starts at $2.99 a month. If you want free hosting with no ads, i would recommend http://x10hosting.com/ all you have to do is log in to their forum every two weeks.   I design websites with Photoshop and then use the Slice tool and Save for web and devices tool, this will give you HTML code for your site. All you have to do is copy and paste this code into Dreamweaver. There are several tutorials online about how to do this.

You can probably gain some performance if you upgrade the amount of Ram on your laptop.  Also, it is impossible to upgrade the graphics cards in 95% of laptops.    I am in the same position.  I bought my laptop 3 years ago, and now I am looking at an obsolete, horrible machine.|`|cf4edaf15617b46e94d234ea845ecdebaa	i don't recommend trying to overclock a laptop.. most bios for laptops are locked anyways.  some laptops allow you to change processors .. but the best upgrade for a laptop is additional ram if you have xp go to 2gig and if vista 4gig|`|7cm7pmAtaa	well you could try changing vista settings to pretty much bare bone or none aero setup that will lighten the resource load that vista is known for and upgrading ram is a must if you have a vista with less than 2Gb otherwise you will find it become horrendously slow after a few apps running.    the down side of turning off some of the aero settings or choosing another desktop skin is it will not look as pretty it will look like XP which for me is fine if I gain some performance.    1.83Ghz is fine (I'm assuming this is a dual core) as long as you aren't running to many apps that are resource hogs like firefox and limewire and such my laptop will play americas army decently with all the graphics tuned settings down|`|5dYrLs45aa	Short answer - you probably can't.     Laptops are not made to be upgraded. Often the processor is soldered in.  Even when they are not, the cooling system is not built to take a higher speed . higher thermal output chip, even if you could find a compatible mobile CPU to buy.|`|XlyLakYAaa	There's this misconception that GHz = performance.  This is NOT the case.  I assume you want it running at 2.2GHz because some software somewhere says that it requires a Pentium 4 running at 2.2GHz.  Your processor is already much faster than a Pentium 4 @ 2.2GHz.    If I'm wrong and you actually do want a Core 2 Duo at 2.2GHz, then you're kind of screwed as laptops cannot be upgraded (except for laptop RAM)|`|t17o7Fh0aa	laptop cpus arent that good to overclock because they get very hot already. best chance to increase system performance would be more ram/defrag hard drive/cut down on running multiple apps at once/check startup programs.  stuff like that.  you wouldnt see a dramatical speed increase in system performance anyway going from 1.83 to 2.2 Ghz.

An external USB flash card.  Most are cheap now days if you don't have that much to backup.  You can get one anywhere they sell computer parts.  First step would be to find out how big everything you want to backup is.  If we are talking over 8 GB, then it will be more expensive as you would need to think about an external hard drive instead of a external flash drive.  The more data you have, the larger the thumb drive would need to be.

72eff2e76e670760cf1e5a011dd01fb8aa	The only interim solution I am aware of is to create local accounts on the file server, give the accounts access to the folder(s) in question, and have the users attach to the shares that way.      If the DC is down there's no way for it to find the user's account SID in Active Directory and therefore no way for it to verify the account's privilege on the folder(s) the user is trying to access.  Thus an account local to the file server is the only way to temporarily "fix" the problem.     And yes you will need to know the file server's local admin password so you can logon to create these local accounts.  A domain admin account with privileges will not work for the same reason the user cannot logon to the domain - i.e., no DC to authenticate the admin.    Even if you create local server accounts the user will still get prompted for the local server username and password when accessing that resource.  There's no real way around that until you get your domain controller back up and running.  If the local account username and password is identical to the user's current domain username and password the server may pass-through the authentication directly and they may not get prompted - but then you'd have to go each user and get that information from them, which is probably not a good idea.      Hopefully you have good backups of your DC's System State so you can do a directory restore.  If not you'll have to rebuild your AD from scratch, recreate the user accounts, and rejoin all the PCs to the AD.    In the future get a cheap box to be your secondary DC. If you're so small that you thought you didn't need a DC in the first place, you don't really need a big server - a Pentium IV clunker with a gig or two of RAM would probably do the trick and probably run you $100 or less.  Not much investment for relative piece of mind.|`|xm7Cv0rgaa	my guess without seeing is all folders are mapped Via the domian you should try direct pear to pear mapping (Machine Name C:) instead of (Domain Name Drive J;)   if that does not help drop me an email and I will help you out.

LR6qZ9Efaa	On most motherboards the FSB is settable to allow for slightly different processors. It just can't be capable of a lesser speed than the processor otherwise if the board is spec'ed less than the processor it won't work. Check the manufacturers site for the board and see if the processor is certified with that board. If the processor is on the motherboards certified list then you can be sure it will work.|`|memleYtRaa	The Front Side Bus sets the highest limit for processor speed. The speed given on the Front Side Bus, is actually Quad-Pumped, or four times its actual rate.    For instance a 1600 FSB is actually a 400 MHz base clock, and a 1333 FSB is actually a 333 MHz base clock.    Now the processor has a base clock, that could be anywhere from 1 MHz up to 333 MHz and be fine but after that it is known as overclocking and results in stability issues.    The actual processor speed is determined by a multiplier of the base clock, for instance, the Intel C2D e8400 has a 333 MHz base clock (Works with a 1333 FSB) and has a multiplier of 9, resulting in a 3 GHz processor.    All that matters is the base clock of the processor does not exceed the base clock of the FSB.

If it's the start menu, that can be changed to Windows 9x style.  You can turn off the visual effects for enhanced performance.  You can also close the widget bar.

zorYTX59aa	It looks like lots of people are asking about YouTube screens  and players that are blank/white/black. Thus, I recently spent  2 hours googling, researching and reading multiple-dozens of  help forums and threads. The best that I was able to come up  with is that there is no "definitive" solution out there. However,  there is 1 interesting factor in almost everything I saw: Firefox.    A few people seemed to discover their own unique solution to  this problem, but no one else was able to duplicate the same  result. Also, each one of those apparent solutions was overly  complicated and written in such bafflegab convoluted "techno-  computerese" that I wouldn't dare recommend any 1 of those  potential fixes.    However, I also did come across 4 somewhat easier possible  solutions, so check these out:    1) If you're using a Mac and have Firefox, then simply log out.    2) One person found success by simply clicking the following:  go to  Tools  Quick Preferences  Edit Site Preferences   Network tab  Browser Identification  Identify as Firefox.    3) Three other people said all they needed to do was delete a  program called "Gnash" (whatever that is).    4) The last possibility is for you to double-check your internet   connection if it's slow or weak -- because some people wrote   that they always noticed "1 item remaining" in the bottom left   corner of their browser screen.    Sorry, but that's all that I can realistically recommend for you.   If you are interested in researching this subject matter further,  feel free to type any of the following into Google's search box:  -- youtube "blank screen"  -- youtube "blank player"  -- youtube "blank box"  -- youtube "white screen"  -- youtube "white player"  -- youtube "white box"  -- youtube "black screen"  -- youtube "black player"  -- youtube "black box"    If nothing above does your thing, let me suggest what I advise  so many other folks when YouTube goes slow, stuck or weird:   Clear your "cache" of its "Cookies", "History" and "Temporary   Internet Files". What I call my famous "CHTIF triple-cure" has   solved 100s of people's YouTube problems, so why not your's.  Simply do the following, then shutdown and reboot:    Internet Explorer 6:   Tools  Internet Options    Delete Cookies  OK   Delete Files  OK   Clear History  Yes    OK    Internet Explorer 7:   Tools  Internet Options > Delete...   Delete files  Yes   Delete cookies  OK   Delete history  OK   Close (browsing history window)   OK    Mozilla Firefox   Tools  Clear Private Data  [x] Browsing History  [x] Download History  [x] Saved Form and Search History  [x] Cache  [x] Cookies   Clear Private Data Now|`|ojXJahZWaa	I know what to do.

A) Remain Friends (you will have to remain friends if you want to continue to see the photos this person uploads)  Every time he uploads a pic with you tagged,   1) Go to the photo  2) Select (remove tag) - this option is available beside your name under every photo he tags of you.    He will not get a notification that you removed the tag and chances are he will not notice or not care that you removed the tag.      B) Completely Block your friend from seeing you on Facebook (this will also block you from seeing his profile and any photos he uploads)  You can block someone by navigating to the Privacy page.  1) Log into your facebook account  2) Go to the Settings link in the top right hand section of the main Facebook page  3) Select Privacy Settings from the drop down list.  4) At the bottom of the privacy screen, use the Block search field to find the person you want to block by name.

So you won't be able to see the beam if it does work, and if it isn't working, you won't be able to see the beam to diagnose and fix the problem.  What will happen is that this invisible beam will be much more dangerous as far as eye safety goes, because an invisible IR beam fries your eyes just as well as a visible laser beam does, but with none of your built-in defense mechanisms that evolution/God gave you to protect your eyes from too much light.  Since you are obviously a laser novice, I would strongly recommend you steer clear of IR lasers, as they are the easiest way to blind yourself if you don't know what you are doing.|`|VkXv4RInaa	yes, but it wont be half as cool.

46OYLEXWaa	Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze.

This can be from malicious scripts on websites, programs/ files being downloaded from websites, email attachments or malicious scripts on emails.

For reviews, comparisons and download links to the latest software from the major antivirus companies, have a look at http://www.datadefender.net.    By the way, Antivirus-1 is a rogue security program.

The risks:  the client may contain malware.  You can minimize the risk of malware by getting the program from the publisher, but not eliminate the possibility that the authorized program is also infected (or that youve unwiitingly mistaken a hackers page for the publishers).  You may also pick up some malicious code just by visiting the programs page (assuming it is the programs page).  Because these programs connect you to a network of other users, you will be expected to have some media to share beforehand.  Also, there is no way to guarantee the safety and quality of the downloaded media.    If you must go the peer-share route, I suggest foregoing Limewire (and its variants) and choosing WinMX or eMule.  Ive been using those programs for years and almost always get what I want.  Ive managed to avoid viruses (many LW users say otherwise) and when I finally tried LW, I discovered it was no better than my programs of choice.    You can also get music by logging onto internet radio stations.  These will stream music through your soundcard.  You can use any number of free programs to save the stream as an mp3 or a wav file.  Audacity will record streaming media, and it can edit the stream to make copies of that stream containing any music you want.|`|6QEiuz7Naa	Limewire all the wayyyyyy!

Otherwise, you are looking pretty secure there dude.|`|901930fc8f0cb1ce4a9483207715497baa	All you really need is    One virus protection program    2-3 spyware/adware protection programs    And a fire wall, unless of course your virus protection comes with one thne you don't need another one      Also note that ccleaner is not for protection, it's just a better disk cleanup tool.

8gi5gfOsaa	It depends on who you are trying to impress. Any 20 pound low gloss will suffice for most situations.     However, if you are wanting to impress, you may wish to use a linen or bonded paper in a heavier weight. You must bear in mind, the heavier and fancier papers are more costly.  If you are mass producing a resume for distribution to numerous prospective employers, then stay with a simple, less costly alternative.    On the other hand, if you are targeting a specific prospective employer or recruitment firm, it may be money well spent to deliver your product with the fancier stocks and heavier weights.    Paper weight and thickness may have little or no noticeable effect on printed image quality. However, heavier, thicker papers feel more substantial and can lend visual weight to a project. Heavy weight paper can lend an air of seriousness not found in flimsier products.|`|bVbFAyzjaa	you can use regular typing paper but it is better if you use what is called "resume paper".  it's like construction paper, just a little bit stiffer than regular paper.  it's also glossy so it looks fancy.|`|RyvKws7Laa	It depends how old you are and what kind of job you're looking to get.  If you're university age or younger, then you can go with the fancy papers as the others here have suggested.  They show a degree of keenness that the potential employer actually might notice as all the resumes are from inexperienced people.    If you're older and have some experience, then put the experience as the first thing on your resume and let that speak for itself.  The more "grown up" the job is the less the paper will matter and what's on it will matter more.  Keep it clean and easy to read and make sure to spell check.  Then let your experience list do its work.|`|berYSEW7aa	the ones made out of trees|`|8nLuyDmPaa	Look at this site.    http://jobsearch.about.com/od/toppicks/l...|`|qdbUU8c0aa	I would recommend actual resume paper, not plain copy paper.

SJM0rzHtaa	Get the dual-DVI card.    You can still use VGA monitors with it--  The DVI ports on the graphics card are DVI-I ports that can also put out VGA signals, and the card comes with DVI-to-VGA pass-through adapters.    And with the dual-DVI card you retain the option to upgrade to better DVI monitors or connect them to HDMI-equipped HDTVs in the future.  (Yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI, while VGA is not.)|`|IARQmZjVaa	Personally, I'd wait until December and get a brand new Windows-7 one.     However, in your case I'd pick Dual DVI so you have options when you upgrade monitors.  VGA doesn't have "quality" that will be distorted by a converter, so don't worry about that.   The computer should include 1 DVI - to - VGA so you'd need to ask for another or find one.       I picked Dual DVI back when I had 2 VGA monitors, and I'm glad I did. A year later I got 2 new DVI ones, and the quality is amazing! Also, DVI is HD ready if you're into Windows Media Center.

Vt0xnuWpaa	The best thing you can do is update your video drivers. There's no much else you can do for most laptops.    The best you can do is try to update the video drivers.    Unless you've ordered the laptop with the card you wanted, you can't swap it out. Unlike Desktop graphics cards, which are limited only by available slots, Laptop graphics cards are hard to find, and even harder to replace.    Laptop GPUs are not cards at all, but GPU chips soldered into the motherboard (which is why the ones with dedicated cards are said to have "discrete graphics" and others have the built-in "integrated graphics" rather than having "cards"), so as are some of the CPUs - meaning you have to melt the metal solder to even take them out. This is the way most laptops today are made. You'll have to be a real expert to be able to swap them successfully - even then success isn't 100%. Manufacturers will not take them back for an upgrade. Furthermore, your laptop motherboard chipset will not allow for you to upgrade to a discrete GPU if you ordered it with the integrated card.    Unless you have a laptop with a separate graphics unit or an MXM slot, you won't be able to upgrade/replace it. Check your manual to see if they allow any upgrades. Few laptops today allow you to do so (the Alienware line being one of the very last) I know for sure that recent Dell laptops use the soldering style.    -----------    The only option you have left is to use an Expresscard-adpated graphics unit, but not yet. Maybe in the near future; right now external graphics through Expresscard is in the process of development/release.    There aren't that many for sale yet in the U.S., but if you're lucky, you can find an ASUS XG Station for sale somewhere (but it won't be cheap considering its around $300 for the dock alone). You just need to have an Expresscard slot. They're only offering the 7900GS and 8600GT (desktop card) for the dock so far, but from the looks of the design you might fit other PCI-E x16 graphic cards into it in the future.    At this point, they will only work for an external monitor. Your laptop display will still be fuzzy.    http://www.hwupgrade.com/articles/print/...  http://img250.imageshack.us/img250/1671/...|`|uYUGdcfzaa	Laptops are generally built not to have their insides ripped out for upgrades - hence the size (memory and hard drives excepted).|`|ajkMt6gRaa	dpends on the laptop probably.  Not sure if there are gamers who use a samsung, but good luck.     Find someone who bought an Alienware and don't want it anymore ( cause they are priced high. )  Pay $800 and they have Nvidia graphics ... that is probably sufficient for any game you would want to play.
2LHgmq97aa	PC is better, here is why...  PC=Variety of specs, options, quality, prices, vendors, support  Mac=One vendor, limited options, still more expensive.  Look below for more information..    Contrary to belief, Macs are not better quality. Apple also has been changing suppliers to try to "lower the price" and thus lowering quality. Even with the lower prices, Macs still cost more, they spend a higher percent of budget trying to make it look pretty, and marketing.     Today, Macs use the same hardware as PCs. Why spend extra to get the same CPU chips, graphics cards  and OS X isn't as secure as you think.. Look below.    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:    Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    Install at least Free Versions of Avira AntiVir, Avast, Comodo Firewall on the Vista.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:    1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION. It can do just about any cool effect a Mac can do and more...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4Fbk52Mk...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3gkX9HDf...  (there is no flickering when you use it like on the video, not sure why the person has the flicker)  3) Like the Mac OS X Doc? google/yahoo Cairo Dock, avant window navigator.  http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x3rf5q_...  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0hzi22g2...    4) It is faster/MORE SECURE. Surf the internet and even run some windows programs with Wnehq/Crossover..    LINUX OS  If you are worried about viruses, spyware, security, Try Linux (it is free), I have included some information about Linux and links  so you are not lost if you decide to try it.    Easily turn your system into a Dual booting computer with Linux, fast, safe and secure, easy to use (contrary to belief). You then get the best of both worlds (Windows with all of its supported products, freely go online without the worry)    Installing Linux in general is very simple and much more secure than OS X(Macintosh) and free.  Also, most Linux distributions have a LiveCD which means you can try without installing...  UBUNTU, KUBUNTU, FREESPIRE, PCLINUXOS, etc.. all have live CDS.  All you have to do is..  A) to download .iso file off the internet from the Linux website  B) burn the .iso file to a CD or DVD (Make sure your burning software can burn an ISO or get InfraRecorder http://infrarecorder.org/ )  C) restart the computer with the CD in the drive  D) As computer is restarting, press on F12 Key a bunch of times to get a boot menu  E) Select the option to boot from CD or DVD.

This is not legal and I would not recommend it for security and legal reasons, the purpose is to show that there is nothing special about the MAC.    A)Price...

Have you ever run a limited user account in Windows? Do you want to do that all the time, or do you find that difficult?    2. Do you have a lot of money to spend?    3. Do you use any Windows-only software?    The answers to these questions are very important to your decision. If you like running Windows as a limited user (the only way to get some proper security in Windows), don't have a lot of money to spend, and use Windows-only software, you're probably better off with a Windows-based computer.    If, however, you hate running Windows as a limited user account, have a lot of money to spend, and don't use Windows-only software, you're probably better off with a Mac computer.    Oh, and one more thing:    4. Have you ever used a Mac before?    Some people use it and fall in love with it. They think it's a work of art. Others use it, find the interface awkward, and go running back to Windows.

uYUGdcfzaa	You can only have one IP address at any one time on one machine.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	Your IP address is provided by your ISP, they only give you one, unless you subscribe to a commercial broadband package. ALL the machines on  your network will have the same public address. You can not change this. Any attempt to change the public IP will cut your connection.It would also give your ISP the right to terminate your service immediately and without notice, leaving you liable for outstanding contract charges, and financial losses caused by any disruption to the service.|`|5AAY41ROaa	You can only have one IP at a time. i have no idea why you would want more than one. your ISP provides the IP and if you have a service that works using a dynamic IP then every time your DSL modem or what ever you have resets itself it will give you a new IP. your Browser doesn't provide an ip address at all.

1NWjta2jaa	Yes, there are extension RAM slots (I think they are called  a "Tree") They can be used in SOME desktops. Not on laptops, where there's no room.<br>  Still it's better to just take out the two RAM chips you have installed and substitute them with larger memory chips.|`|t5sYXwSqaa	RAM depends on the CPU you are using, chip set amd motherboard. Unfortunately you are limited to the amount of RAM you can put into a a computer. You can test how much by going to Crucial or Offtek Websites. Once the limit has been reached you cannot go any higher. As a basic; 16bit systems can only support 1GB, 32,bit systems can support up to 4GB but will only show 3.5 or around and 64bit systems will allow more than this. Hope this helps as a basic guide.|`|AA11182621	No you can not. <br>  <br>  But why do you want more RAM slots? why not just get two larger memory chips, this will avoid a lot of problems with RAM matching too|`|XAChanlCaa	best thing to do is to replace them larger RAM chips<br>  google...crucial.com...run a scan to see what your PC will take|`|XsJwofd1aa	No as the RAM slots are`an intergal part of the motherboard|`|rMs4WBfcaa	No|`|434cdba191b138eb36e563b9ef737a76aa	Unless your motherboard is equipped to do that the answer is no.

2SSA9e9Naa	It has to do with entity relationship diagrams. An identifying line is one that links data that is part of the primary key for the relationship.    If it is not a primary key then it is a non-identifying link.    Relationships between two entities may be classified as being either "identifying" or "non-identifying". Identifying relationships exist when the primary key of the parent entity is included in the primary key of the child entity. On the other hand, a non-identifying relationship exists when the primary key of the parent entity is included in the child entity but not as part of the child entity's primary key. In addition, non-identifying relationships may be further classified as being either "mandatory" or "non-mandatory". A mandatory non-identifying relationship exists when the value in the child table cannot be null. On the other hand, a non-mandatory non-identifying relationship exists when the value in the child table can be null.

DCXk0bVLaa	Take the vocal out of a song and you are left in most cases with a repetitious backing track. The vocal provides the main tune or melody.<br>  An instrumental as such uses lead guitar, keyboard or other instrument to provide the tune.<br>  The vocal cannot be fully removed without the original multi-track studio recording.<br>  Audacity 1.3.7 beta is a free app with a vocal remover function.<br>  The success of the removal depends entirely on the way the song was mixed in the studio.<br>  Vocals are usually in the center of the mix as are the drums and bass.<br>  Vocal removers work by removing content common to both tracks and as this applies to vocals, drums and bass they are all removed.<br>  End result - not what you want.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://audacity.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://audacity.sourceforge.net/</a><br>  <br>  You will still need to learn how to use it - there is no one click does all method.<br>  <br>  If you can't get the result you want from this then your best alternative is, as suggested, a karaoke version.|`|2RQ4qDhXaa	That's not going to be easy - or possible, in most cases.

My father also is an experienced IT guy, and he and I have been going back and forth in the race for the better gaming rig.  I always win.  Not because I spend more or am any smarter than he is, but because my AMD is always faster than his intel when you compare dollar for dollar, and the same for my GeForce over his Radeon.

If anyone bought that in the last month, that is just dumb. The GTX 295 is the best, and nvidia wins in every price range except the sub $50 range. Although, if you are looking for a sub $50 card, then it isn't for gaming. If you go with nvidia, you are set.

I think you just recorded some playing video on your screen.   Frankly speaking, DemoCreator or HyperCam program like this is not intended for re-recording of other video clips from the screen (e.g. playing in Media Player, RealVideo, QuickTime etc.), but rather for creating regular software presentations, tutorial, demos etc. If it can do that, the quality of the captured video is hard to reach the original one.If you do want to make some video clips, use some video processing program like Web Video Author or Premiere.|`|W9OOH2lEaa	I used to use Total Screen Recorder.It is nice and do the job pretty well.

This stretches the battery and makes it last a lot longer.  Laptop batteries aren't meant to be used continuously while plugged in.
AIqgmEB0aa	There are two "types" of facebook mobile, mobile texts and facebook mobile site.    Using facebook mobile texts does not use the internet in any way, as FB mobile is used by texting commands to FBOOK (as the name implies).    Using the Facebook Mobile site however (ie. browsing to m.facebook.com) may incur you charges from your provider for every kilobyte, megabyte, etc (depending on your provider) that you send/receive from the site. Usually this feature is more expensive.      Since you have unlimited texting you will probably want to stick with  1 , FB mobile texts, in which you do not actually browse the site, rather you text commands to it for certain features such as wall post, status update, etc. Facebook will not charge you anything at all for using their mobile service (or virtually any of their services, in fact).    However you MAY incur charges for receiving/sending text messages from your phone. If you are not sure whether your plan includes this (and/or the rates) I would check with your cell phone provider first to confirm it (ie. how much for each text sent/received FROM A WEBSITE) before you go ahead and signup for it.    If you have any more questions I can be contacted at the below resource.|`|4Gt3ZVqsaa	You will pay by the megabyte. I advise not to use it as it is really expensive.

Vt0xnuWpaa	If you feel comfortable with Dell, continue with them. You might order a Studio or wait for the newer Inspiron 1545. They have great self service as far as I can tell. I've been looking around other manufacturer websites for drivers and spare parts and have needed to go to great lengths to navigate the pages of HP, Sony, and Toshiba to find what I need. As far as I know, Dell makes very solid PCs and has some of the best support around.    Now if you wanted to try something new, HP has a lot of affordable laptops that you can customize and order straight from their website (much like you can from Dell). However, their self service and online support is a bit weak in comparison to Dell's, but their products are pretty reliable and stylish as well.    If you're a fan of Macintosh's Operating Systems, you might go for an Apple.     Sonys tend to be a bit expensive for the hardware you pay for. I don't think they're any more or less reliable than some of the other brands out there. Asus, Acer, Gateway, Toshiba, and other brands also make pretty reliable and inexpensive laptops as well. However, their support isn't nearly as good as Dell's and HP's. Just check out the websites of local retailers like BestBuy/Walmart/CircuitCity/Fry's to see what kind of laptops they have to offer.    You might also try buying from online outlets like http://www.newegg.com and http://www.tigerdirect.com . They also have good deals and a reliable sales reputation.    It all boils down to what brand you want and what kind of specifications you need. I don't really have any specific models in mind for you right now. If you need help analyzing price and product, Feel free to message me.|`|AA11736483	Lenovo (formerly IBM) make the best laptops. Next is HP, but stay away from their cheap models like Pavilion.

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|6HIrPMjOaa	www.crucial.com or you can reformat your computer how old is your computer is it a windows me or vista?|`|3WbNrDZ0aa	lime wire has a lot of viruses and you may need Ram it can be a little expensive depending on what you need and were from 50 to 100 dollars|`|X1Wxpu93aa	www.tigerdirect.com they are on sale right now and you need to know the specs on you computer to see if they match.    1) erase old programs and clean your desktop to where only shortcuts are on it. the desktop is not made for large files. it takes up alot of ram  2) download a virus scanner. maybe spyware doctor or ad-aware to take of viruses  3) elimate unwanted  processes running in the background ctrl + alt + delete... then go to processes  4) go to tigerdirect and look up ram or flash memory and buy some that fits your computer

tYhkdr63aa	Yes you need wireless adapters for each system you want to connect to your network.      When choosing your adapter type you need to consider what options you have open.  Does your computer have any available PCI slots?      Buying PCI cards would mean you have to open your computer towers and physically install the cards.  Are you good at installing new cards?

4MYWPD9Yaa	I'd start with Linux Mint. It's based on Ubuntu, so it gets a lot of solid support from forums and blog posts for documentation. But it comes with popular proprietary codecs preinstalled (MP3 playback, DVD playback, Flash web browser plugin).<br>  <br>  It's also graphical.<br>  <br>  Most Linux web servers will stick you with a full-screen command prompt. It's probably best to start with a point-and-click Linux and ease your way into the terminal before installing the server stuff.|`|5zSSGKBpaa	Before installing I would suggest that you get the live-cds for various linux distros to see which one will work best on YOUR computer hardware. Some versions of linux have problems with some graphics cards (nvidia seems to work best) and wireless cards. The live-cd will not make any changes to your hard drive, and it will run a little slow because it is running from the cd and not the hard drive. Once it is installed it will run like all your other programs. If everything works with the live-cd everything will work when installed. If for example your wireless won't work with the live-cd if you install it it will need to have some work done (look for and install new drivers, edit configuration files, etc). It CAN usually be fixed but it will take a little work and for a person new to linux it can be very frustrating.<br>  When you find one that works and you like I would also suggest that you read the instructions and tutorials from the website of that distro on how to install, setup and use linux. This will make using linux a much more pleasant experience.<br>  If you just go ahead and install linux and try to use it the same way you used windows you are almost guaranteed to be frustrated and unhappy. Linux may sorta kinda look like windows but it is not windows and you have to do things a little differently in linux. I am not saying it is hard to use linux just different. <br>  Here are a couple websites that can be very helpful in learning linux.

pTkYpSPsaa	It's not IE or Mozilla the most safest web browser anymore. Opera brings more features than those. When I used IE as my default explorer, it was terribly horrible. Then I switched to Mozilla Firefox which is more convenient to use, but having problems on running the page on Java and Adobe Flash Player/Adobe Reader. So then I moved on to Google Chrome, from what I see on those three is that GC is more of hard-to-use. Then I found Opera for Windows. Opera makes it all easy, after the years of the Browser Wars, Opera still won the competition and hit the top 1 of the browsers.|`|qnsItVZpaa	I also had Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox. I thought Mozilla Firefox was the best until it just started closing for no reason and kept asking for add-ons. Then i went to Google Chrome i thought it was kind of hard to use and very extra slow. So i kept IE7. I really like it. It automatically adds whats needed. And it plays youtube videos, which i had trouble playing on Mozilla. I am very happy with IE7.|`|AA11437087	go to add or remove program in the control panel remove program you don't want others will be untouched.stick with IE-7|`|5Zh45VPTaa	Gary,    There is no down side to having multiple browsers installed. There are no conflicts or performance issues with having Firefox, Chrome and IE installed, so you do not need to worry about that. Just set one as your default so Windows is clear on which you want to use as your main browser. Overall, Firefox is currently the best browser for the PC. This may change as Chrome matures, but overall, nothing beats Firefox. It's stable, fast, safe, and there are tons of great themes and extensions. IE is the worst browser you could use. It is everything Firefox is not.    If you want, you can easily remove Chrome and keep on using Firefox, it will not mess anything up. I would keep IE installed on your system, as there are occasional websites Firefox doesn't work with.    In conclusion, keep all the browsers you want, uninstall all the browsers you want, it doesn't matter. Use the one that you like best (while avoiding IE).

Yes, that's also possible, but home computers are so complicated these days that it's not a one-man job any more.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	If you had to ask the first question, forget your own OS. Of course it is possible to write new programs for Windows. Where do you think all the programs you use come from? To write an OS is totally different, it takes years.|`|zjuRv62eaa	Oh yes, there are ways to create new programs. The fastest and easiest way is to learn Visual Basic. The programs will only work on Windows but it's the fastest way to to create a program. And it won't look too professional. If you really want to program seriously thwn you should learn Python, Java or C.  Making you own operating system is very very very hard work. Don't even attempt it at your own.
KVkU6WSpaa	A web browser is a software tool that allows you to navigate to various places (URLs) on the Internet (World Wide Web), and display and interact with the text, video, images, etc. that are available there.

VdHKQMeXaa	Many times I have stared at my computer thinking "How do I fix my pc because it keeps crashing?"  Unfortunately there is no simple answer! I used to think this problem was related to buying cheap computers but after buying various laptops and desktops at different price ranges there is one common theme, eventually they will all crash at some stage!   Friends will often think I am a pc expert and will call me asking "How do I fix my pc when it keeps crashing?" Well start by asking yourself these questions...  Have your children be on the pc? Kids are great at downloading spyware by mistake! They will also click on numerous pop up pages and will often change your settings!  Another possible reason your pc keeps crashing is that you have overloaded it! If your pc only has 64mb RAM memory and you install graphic, gaming and other software the chances are that your system will not be able to cope with your software! Most PC's now come with at least 512mb RAM so it is worth upgrading if your pc is not at this level.  However the most common reason that your pc keeps crashing is that it has a virus! Many trojan virus can cause your computer to reboot immediately once all programs have been launched, this can drive you mad and it is not fun as you are helpless!  Best option is to install anti virus software and make sure you only visit trusted websites. If all else fails it is time to reformat your hard drive and wipe your pc clean, this can take hours and you will probably need the data recovery disc that you should have got when you bought the pc.  Recommend tool: http://toptenantispywareviews.com [if you do not have one]|`|pNu1yDWxaa	This problem is most likely caused by a program that does not close or run properly. Check all software you have installed since the problem started. Uninstall it and see if that fixes it. Other wise do a full virus scan using a good secruity program.|`|2YsKHSpkaa	Some computers have a shutdown feature if the CPU gets too hot. Not sure without seeing it.

P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	You do know that is illegal right?|`|hOwkTiHAaa	no!!! limewire causes viruses!!! i know because my fiance is a pc technician and 99% of his computers that come in have viruses and when he examines whats on them, they have limewire!! theres a 100% correlation. use bearshare lite. i've used it for several years and never had any viruses, spyware, or adware. as long as you turn your sharing off it's legal|`|9OFEj10uaa	limewire has a ton of viruses...not the program but the people who put songs and its illegal...but i dont give a crap bcuz i download illegal stuff as well....if your looking to not breaking the law i recommend get audacity...or some other recording program...    http://audacity.sourceforge.net/    and just record the songs.    but if u dont care use torrents...if u need info on torrents then just ask

While some will require a small investment the others will only cost you some time. Here are some that only cost some time.    1. Article Marketing...write 10 to 20 articles using keywords that are related to your site, then you need to submit them to some of the top article directories. Ezine Articles, Search Warp, Go Articles, and Article City are a few of the better ones.    2. Forum Signature Marketing....you need to Google your niche keyword plus the word "forum", then you need to join a few of them and then check them out each day for say 30 to 60 days. After the first few days you will get a feel for what kind of problems these people have and if there are any solutions that you can provide them if they were to buy your product, join your list or whatever. You then need to provide some interaction with the other forum members by leaving posts that give some value to the forum. Once you have become a regular so to speak you then need to add a forum signature to your posts linking back to your website.    3. Suidoo Lens....you need to join Suidoo and set up a lens that will have links to your website. Your lens should be about whatever your website is about.    4. Social Bookmarking sites...you can join several of these and use your posts and tweets to also point back to your website.     5. Join the "Warrior Forum" and you can learn about numerous other ways to get some traffic to your site, there are several other Internet Marketing forums that you can join and they all have some very good information on traffic generation.

If you have a 160 GB HDD or bigger, perhaps you partition into two and install Windows 7 on the new empty partition.  Then, like me, you will have a dual boot configuration Vista/Windows 7.

In exchange people using the Beta put up with bugs, and usually have to participate in some kind of program to help the company fix problems with it.    Microsoft is going to start selling Windows 7 in about a year's time. In the meantime, they have pre-released it to the public. You can get a copy off their website - although you'll need to hurry. I think they are planning on ending the Beta soon.

Click the Start button, click Run, type poledit, and then click OK to start System Policy Editor.  On the File menu, click Open Registry, and then double-click Local Computer.  Click the plus sign (+) next to System.  Click Network Path For Windows Setup, then type the new source path.   Save the changes to the registry, quit System Policy Editor, and then restart Windows. To modify the Setup source path with Registry Editor, modify the following registry value:   HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\...   After you update the registry with System Policy Editor or Registry Editor, extract a new copy of the Layout.inf file from the Precopy2.cab file on your new Windows media to the Windows\Inf folder on the hard disk.  For example, if you are changing the Setup source path because you switched from Windows disks to a Windows CD-ROM, extract the Layout.inf file from the Win95 folder on the Windows 95 CD-ROM to the Windows\Inf folder on the hard disk. For information about using the Extract tool, type extract at a command prompt, or see the following article in the Microsoft Knowledge Base:    Or try this.  Right-click My Computer, and then click Manage.   Under Computer Management, click Disk Management. In the right pane, youll see your drives listed.

Assuming this is a blue screen and that it does this on every boot up, I would find a backup disk, boot in to MS DOS mode, and copy all of the files you want to save. Then when you're ABSOLUTELY SURE that you have saved everything that you would like to save, insert the Windows CD and and attempt a repair. If the repair doesn't work you will need to format your disk and reinstall Windows (this is why you need to back up your data, as formatting the disk is erasing everything on it). If you aren't familiar with MS DOS...    Notice the prompt. It says "C:\>". This is the current directory, or folder. Right now you are in no folder, just in the drive (well you might be in C:\WINDOWS>). Think of this like My Computer in Windows when you click on drive C. Folders are now called directories. The documents are going to be saved in either C:\documents and settings or C:\my documents depending on whether you run Windows 9.x or Windows NT (including XP and Vista). To enter a folder or directory, type "cd (directory name)". To move up folders, type "cd ..". To get a listing of files, type "dir". To change drives, type (drive letter):. For instance, to change to the F drive, type F: . (ignore the period) When you copy, move to the directory you would like to copy the files to and type "copy (drive)(path)(file)". I'm probably confusing you, so here's an example of what it looks like to copy FILE1.txt from the C drive to the A drive:    C:\>cd documents and settings  C:\documents and settings\>cd USER  C:\documents and settings\USER\>dir  Volume in drive C has no label.  Volume serial number is ****-****  Directory of C:\documents and settings\USER\    01/15/09  7:30a              .  01/15/09  7:30a              ..  01/15/09  7:30a              Desktop  01/15/09  7:30a              Favorites  01/15/09  7:30a              My Documents  01/15/09  7:30a              Start Menu  01/15/09  7:30a              1,257 FILE1.txt                            1 file(s) 1,257bytes                           4 dir(s)  340,287,909,098 bytes free  C:\documents and settings\USER>A:  A:\>copy C:\documents and settings\USER\FILE1.txt    repeat this for every file you would like to save, or try copying the folder containing the files itself. You might also try Norton Commander.  Anyway, the point is, attempt a repair, if it doesn't work, save your files and format, reinstall Windows.    Phew, a long answer. Hope it helps and good luck!

They are usually $20-30 and come with the version of Windows that your computer shipped with. Then you can use one of the upgrade disks to move up to Vista.<br>  <br>  Otherwise you are going to need to buy a complete retail version of Windows - NOT an upgrade disk. You can get a OEM copy of XP for about $100 or so online or at a computer supply store (not a retail store). Again, once you get XP you can upgrade to Vista if you want.<br>  <br>  That's about it, unfortunately. The upgrade disks need an older platform to work from - they won't work alone - and there's no legal place to download Windows. <br>  <br>  Personally, I'd order the factory disks. When I did for my old Compaq it took about two week and was $21 with shipping.|`|Wfka9jeIaa	To answer your second question, getting a Windows OS online is illegal, so I wouldn't suggest that at all.<br>  <br>  Really, all I can say is save up about 100 dollars for Windows XP or something. I've never heard of an upgrade disk that does a fresh install. It usually just updates or replaces core system files from the last operating system.|`|TcIj5dBNaa	Linux is always a good, free solution. You can download it online and burn it to a CD and even try it out without installing to see if you like it or not.

You may have noticed a black stop sign shaped marking (or in some cities a circle) in the roadway. This is where they have cut into the concrete or asphalt and laid in a magnetic loop (the black stuff is a sealer to keep the rain from rusting it). As your car passes over it, it sends a magnetic pulse (from the metal in your car or motorcycle) thru an underground cableing system to a computer terminal at the intersection (usually housed near the intersection in a large metal box on one corner), signaling that a car is coming from a certain direction. This is how a turn lane signal knows when to activate the turn signal for you. As for the length of a green or yellow or red light is dependant on timers in the computer terminal and some areas are need based. You ever wonder why you fly down the highway and the light turns yellow as soon as you hit the first crosswalk? This is how. As for your headlights, it is a common myth that flashing your headlights will trigger a signal to change for you. This is false. Their is a system used by police, firefighters, ambulances as such called an Opti-Com or Opti-Flash, which is a traffic signal preemption device that sends out a coded digital white strobe flash at a certain flash rate and candlepower, much faster and brighter than any headlight. This light is read by a small sensor usually on the traffic light pole and sent to the computer to trigger a green light for the emergency responders so they dont have to wait in traffic while the other 3 sides have red lights (this is why it seems like your light got skipped when a fire engine went through, its just the computer resetting itself into its normal pattern)

DCXk0bVLaa	The quality of any audio recording is only as good as the input.  You won't get a good result quickly.  It takes time, practice, patience and experience.  Microphone type, position, recording level, recording location and quality of instruments all need to be considered.  While professional (expensive) Digital Audio Workstations have a lot more functions with which to add effects etc to the sound if the recording is not done properly the result is rubbish.  Input = Output.    What you need for a band is a multi-track audio recording and editing program which would be Audacity. Totally free.  Fleximusic does not appear to be a multi-track app.  Plus it's a trial which will cost you 20 bucks to buy.    With Audacity you can record the whole band at once but you would require a multi channel mixer to get a good result.  The other alternative is on a track by track basis then do a final mixdown into wav format for burning to CD.    So you can hear the previous track while recording a new one you will need to reset the default.  Go to file / preferences.  Click the Audio I/O tab.  Tick the box marked - Play other tracks while recording new one.
1NBe2Jo7aa	Despite what the fanboys say, windows and mac osx are very similar. Here is a quick list of pros and cons of both...  windows:pros  compatible with a lot of software such as games  cheap because they don't make there own hardware  very good for office work, microsoft office is the standard for office applications (good for you since you are going to college)  cons:  not very secure (actually though, vista is much more secure than previous windows os's)  some will say that it is harder to use (I regard these people as retarded though)    mac osx:pros  good quality (this is sort of a generalization, because there are various manufacturers of windows pc's, only one that makes macs (apple))  easy to use (once again, this only applies if you are half retarded)  stylish  very secure  cons:  EXPENSIVE, huge turn off, they charge way too much for what is inside there computers (personally, I don't think it is worth it just for this as if you buy a windows pc for the same price, it will be rediculously powerful and fast)  some programs (mostly open source software and games) won't work on macs    That is just a brief generalization of the two os's. I personally like linux the most (cause it is free), however currently I quad-boot linux mint, ubuntu, windows vista, and windows 7 beta.    PS: In response to the answer right above me, I do agree with you that windows is the better operating system, however it is true that macs don't currently get viruses. All of those viruses for macs that you claim are purely concepts, although they do pose a serious threat because most mac users have the sense they are invincible to viruses (thanks to those mac vs pc ads) so when finally a virus hits, it will be a disaster in the mac world.|`|yH8Gnm4yaa	Windows.

I troubleshoot vista, xp, and mac all day and you wouldn't believe the issues I get with Microsoft.  As far as Macs not getting viruses, that is a true/false answer.  Yes, they can get viruses but not as easily as Windows computers. Secondly, guess what type of viruses they get? Windows viruses.

To get rid of spyware and keep your computer clean you can use an antispyware or even more.   You can download a antispyware software. There are 10 good anti-spywares.  here is the reviews: http://toptenantispyware.com/    You can download one and scan your system.  All are safe and can be trusted.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|WQ0DzpByaa	Spyware Guard 2008.

ytl2PONXaa	Yes, I have used Windows 7.    First off, it's a lot faster than Vista.     Secondly, it basically has the same graphics as vista but they somehow condensed everything to be faster.     The other difference (which most people don't care about) is the 200MB partition that it creates on install. It's not huge but it seems to be the boot files since you can only boot from that partition (I triple-boot using Ubuntu, Windows 7, and Windows XP).    One thing that 7 has is also IE8. I don't see a visual change but it seems to work. And as a note, the "start" menu has changed a little compared to Vista. It's more revamped but based on the Vista-style menu.

FBQZ06vraa	If you're running Windows XP and those folders appear in the root of your C: drive (C:\), it may well not be malware, but your Windows recycle bin.  Try this:    1. In Windows Explorer, locate the Recycler folder and open it.   2. If there's a folder with a recycle bin icon next to it and a name starting something like  S-1-5-21-..... then that's your recycle bin and you needn't worry.  3. To check one step further, double-click that S-1-5-21 folder and you should see your recycle files.    By the way, the regeneration of the folder is a feature of Windows.    Hope that helps.|`|dkpIjt5jaa	Me again, I have researched for over an hour for more tactics to destroy this infestation and I have found these:    This one is a nasty tenacious Malware/Virus. The reason antivirus suites dont see the virus is because the file attribute of its files are set to system/superhidden. So even if you set your folder view to Show hidden files, it would still not show up. You have to enable showsuperhidden key in the registry then do a full system scan as that virus/trojan put files inside the windows directory and modify keys in the registry. Particularly the ShowSuperHidden key.    To modify that key: Click "run" at the start menu, type regedit (the Registry editor will open), Go to HKEY_CurrentUser\Software\Microsoft\  Windows\Explorer\Advanced  (I had to insert a space for it to show here - just write it completely (or copy, paste and remove the space) from HKEY to advanced    on the left side look for the key ShowSuperHidden and set it to 0 (ZERO).    Close the Registry editor then on Folder options, View tab, select Show hidden files.     You may have to reboot for the changes to take effect.     Then Do a full system scan with everything again (including your anti-virus), with your removable drives plugged in.    They should now be detected ( I hope ! )      Another way I found is this: http://pcmav.server.or.id/ this: http://pcmav2.blogspot.com/2009/01/pcmav... and this: http://bibeh.com/recycler-variant-pcmav-... (and cleaned up the English on the pages): PCMAV Program [version 1.92] - In flash disk and hard drive of victim, there are folder(s) by the name of Recycler, resycler or resycled (yes with a "s") within which there are folder(s) using alpha numeric name, example: S-1-5-21-1482476501-1644491937-682003330... the icon looks like the icon for Recycle Bin. If this folder is accessed from Explorer, file of virus will not show.     Welcome to PCMAV.SERVER.OR.ID, this website provide download link for the newest version and the lastest update for antivirus PCMAV.    Our goal is provide easy and quick link for downloading PCMAV and its updates. Not like a blog that change the first page in every new release of PCMAV or update, and you need to search the related post to get the lastest PCMAV or update. We make it easy! Just come to this site and all download link will be avaliable on our main page.    You can get and download the newest version of PCMAV program in this section. Download files available in a compressed file(RAR or WinRar Archive), its contains PCMAV-CLN.exe, PCMAV-RTP.exe and readme.txt.  Released Date: Thursday, 15 January 2009 - Filename: P-C-M-A-V_1.92.rar - Filesize: 2.052 MB(s) - MD5: 0e063dc294ed0f71d2353b47250219b1    Download link for the latest version (you may have to try a few times by refreshing): http://pcmav.server.or.id/filez/pcmav/0e... - The readme.txt is in Indonesian but (from what I read) list that it controls all Recycler variants up to 2 weeks ago !      Again be careful doing any of those things so you don't nuke your system    I really hope it works this time !|`|uuDloQnCaa	How to remove Fake Software, Pop-Ups, Spyware, Trojans and Viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete what ever they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use.

SkpRC2Nmaa	What is your problem exactly
elhRdmuFaa	I wrote program that loaded a large XML data file at startup and processed it building up a large Tree View on a background thread. I sub-classed or derived the Thread class and added an event to it called ReportProgress. My main dialog had an event handler to the ReportProgress event. This event would be fired by the background thread and report back what percentage of the data file had been processed. Then I would update the progress bar in that event handler. If the user wanted to perform an operation that required the data file be completely loaded, I would show a modal dialog with the progress bar and they would have to wait for it to complete. In order to do this in that dialog, I would check to see if the thread was still alive. If it was, then the main thread would sleep for 100 milliseconds and check again. This prevented the application from looking unresponsive. On thing to note is that UI objects have to be modified from the main thread with the message loop. You might have to use Invoke to update the progress bar from a background thread. Invoke marshals the call to the main thread.|`|vUsVieulaa	Use a BackgroundWorker to run the CPU-intensive task.

Put simply, you give the script no eason to start reading from the top again.  It reads to the bottom of the code, and then exits.  If you don't want to do a ton of re-programming, I'd just introduce another loop, outside of what you already have, e.g.:    switch = 0  while switch > 1:      all-of-your-stuff      with-a-menu-entry-that-says      if i want out of the menu:          switch +=1

Good security requires a multi-layered approach, and the least important layer by far is running some kind of anti-malware program (in fact, if you take care of all the other layers, you don't even need an anti-malware program using up extra resources).    In order of importance:    1. Create and use almost exclusively a limited user account instead of the default administrator account Windows sets you up with    2. Read up on social engineering and how to avoid it    3. Don't download illegal copies of software, music, or movies    4. Set Windows updates to install automatically    5. Make regular backups. If possible, back up your entire installation (using Norton Ghost or Acronis True Image)|`|uuDloQnCaa	You also need a firewall, Windows comes with a built in basic firewall if you want a stronger firewall then Comodo Pro is free and very strong yet light on memory.

Try to check if they are firewalls and anti-virus softwares as well. You are less likely to get viruses or spyware with different types of programs. Scan your computer once every now and then.     Good Luck!|`|5fkqsnBJaa	For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. Your Kaspersky is excellent....top shelf stuff.    3. One should never use MalwareBytes Anti-malware (MBAM) as your only anti-spyware program.     Malwarebytes Antimalware (MBAM) is a specialised removal tool to deal with approximately 1600 of the latest...and toughest to remove threats:  http://www.malwarebytes.org/malwarenet.p...    That's 1600 out of the over one half million (500,000) virus and malware threats out there:  http://www.securityfocus.com/brief/655?r...     While MBAM is excellent at what it does, it is not a comphrehensive anti-malware solution and should only be used in addition to good general-purpose anti-virus and anti-spyware software.    For a good general-purpose anti-spyware/ anti-malware:  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version and it is excellent.    Keep MBAM too, it will do no harm. And you may need it some day.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...|`|ByS1Ye8raa	lol you are gay, i use no antivirus or firewall at all    my protection from attacks is my router, i have no open ports    protection from viruses is me practicing safe browsing habbits, not downloading a virus    im more 1337 than you all admit it|`|zI6cZoAWaa	ccleaner|`|AA10068419	Because Windows will be Windows and Anti-virus programs detect virus activity or discovers dormant virii    Malware/spyware detection because not all malware are virii and some virii arrive as malware/spyware which are called droppers...they drop off the virii.

Don't take any shortcuts or time-savers, but cut the chewed part out, trim a small bit of rubber back from the ends, and seperate the 2 wires with about 1/4" oif space between the trimmed ends.       Electrical tape, about 2 times around, the first wire, and then do the second with 2 times around also.       After You've finished the 2 wires seperately, tape them together tightly, just to keep any outside sources from damaging the seprate tape on each wire.

er2VCmiCaa	Just so you know, adding RAM doesn't make your computer faster in some instances. Look, if you have 1GB RAM and your computer only uses 1/2 of that (on average), what is adding RAM going to do? I'll tell you, it wastes money. The best that it'll do is stimulate the economy. If you want to speed up your computer,   1. "deleting temporary and unneeded files",   2. and you should come up with something good. Also, use Disk Defragmenter and Disk Cleanup. If you think it'll slow your computer down more while you do it, yes, it does. But fear not, you should do it in the middle of the night. Start Disk Defrag, Virus Scan, and Disk Cleanup before you go to bed, and when you wake up, it should be done and almost always faster! Just remember, don't defrag every day. It can make things worse. Once a week or bimonthly is fine. Happy Computing!    3.Some Cleaner can help you do this all.  See the reviews from:  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere...|`|6ZiIw4ugaa	Lack of ram? yes    Lack of hard drive space? Lack of disk space won't really slow your computer down but you might not be able to save any files or anything.|`|jwurmVbVaa	yup|`|ah9ewUaUaa	You mean lack of RAM (random access memory) and yes. RAM means how many different things your computer can handle all at once, it's like a storage space that you constantly fill up and empty (like fast forwarding a week and your fridge), the smaller the fridge the slower it will get to get food, because then you'd have to go to the store more often.  Also when you have too many fragmented files around your computer, the lack of room on a single hard drive is bad, because "Fragmented files" means you store the files in different spots on your computer harddrive. The more places it has to go to open a program, the slower it is. Its like making a pizza, your canned tomato sauce is downstairs cubby, the garlic is in the pantry upstairs, frozen pizza dough is in the freezer in the garage. More fragments, the slower. So you can make your computer faster by running the program "disk defragmenter" (just search it on menu, search, disk defragmenter"),|`|79fa22b0bfcb741ebea37f6761d4896aaa	lack of hard drive space? no unless you have like less then 2 gb of space left.

You can go to control panel and go to unistall and take out what ever you don't need. You can go to my computer right click on your driver, and you can see how much room you have left. Need more help just ask.|`|zsKaMqvuaa	are you talking RAM? (random access memory) or the actual hard drive?  it its ram, then yes. because ram is needed to sort tasks and save information until it is not needed. then its discarded. so the more RAM the more memory you dont have to get rid of before opening a new task.    as for hard drive space.  not nearly as much as RAM.  it may take some time for the computer to look through the files to get what you need and of course the more files the slower.    but if you are looking to quicken up your computer get another stick of RAM for it and it aught to be like new.|`|dd7a6b1296760b08bd746b164b6c8787aa	CAPITAL Y CAPITAL E|`|skd8PQGSaa	yes a lack of hard drive space can certainly make your computer slower in extreme cases.  not only does the hard drive performance slow to a crawl, but since there is less room for virtual memory (in windows), you lose more performance there as well.  I work for a hard drive manufacturer and we generally recommend keeping 15 - 20% of your hard drive free to optimize performance.  kind of a drag i know, but it really is true.|`|7plGDnvMaa	Lack of ram makes your computer slower; a small hard drive will get it to where your computer won't work any more.|`|xruBwbXHaa	Yes it does if u have alot of stuff on it|`|18cf3783a2afe133792892d1ff86ec1daa	not really...  because low in hard drive space mean you cannot store more data on it, hard drive is use to store data and files,if out of memory...cannot store more on it...ok    but...    if too much out of memory (etc 500 MB left) it will give little effect the performance of computer...ok

m9bRpmN4aa	I had the same problem in 2007 when I had first joined MySpace, it's a common problem these days so you're not alone, and I also come across many other people like you on here who ask for help about their addiction.    I had THOUGHT that I had nothing to do, when really I was avoiding things to spend more time on my MySpace. When friends invited me out, i'd invite them over to my house instead, so I could have my myspace open and not go offline. I would even eat my dinner infront of my computer instead of with my family. Everyone started noticing how much of an addiction it was for me...    My mother decided to cut off my internet all together - she wanted me to stop going on it. I was furious when I woke up one morning and found that I couldn't log on or connect or anything. I realised though that, she was trying to help me overcome it, and I needed to get out more. So I texted and called as many friends and made plans to go see movies, shop, ice skate, ect anything to keep me socialised and on my feet.    When I was at home, i'd do chores around my house - boring as it sounds, it actually kept me fit and by the end of the day, I was too tired to even think about what was happening in the myspace world. I had made it to 2 months when my mother said she would give me my net back on a few conditions. She would monitor my myspace/internet usage, I had to go to bed at a certain time, and I wasn't allowed to avoid going out and I wasn't allowed to eat in my room anymore. It has worked and it's now been a year and a half and I am not addicted anymore.    I think you should sit down with your parent(s) and/or guardian and set some rules. Make sure you have limits for yourself and having your family around to watch out for you is really going to help you in the end. Move the computer or have your laptop into the kitchen or lounge room if you have to.    You need to do something about this now rather then later because, you never know how bad a problem is until you lose a friend or something over it and it ruins something for you. Trust me, I know!    Take careee :)|`|QiwZRLf8aa	delete your account  get a job if your old enough|`|L1KVUIJ6aa	when did u get yours? i know when i got mine, i was way addicted for about a month and now i just go on whenever i feel like it, which is like maybe once a day, if im not busy that day
4dd560996c61dfc7cf916ee07a422c25aa	Spyware Guard 2008 and Antivirus 2009 really destroyed me. It would constantly shove porn sites in my face, repeatedly warn me about fake infections with annoying popups, and refused to let me go to any site that would help me remove it.  I know I got it from this awful yet wonderful Mangafox site (even though I'm still bitter about being infected I still love the site). I know it was that site because I had never gotten a virus until it went to it, plus my computer only acted up when I was on it.I removed it by using Mcafee, Avast, Malwarebytes, and Spybot Search&Destroy.  All of the antiviruses and antispyware had trouble with the two malware, and it made me feel like all anti spyware and malware were useless. A virtual machine and sandbox are the only things that REALLY make me feel protected.|`|XlyLakYAaa	That Antivirus 2009 virus is pretty bad.  Often if I don't care about the computer's data I just reformat the crap out of it.  Luckily I'm skilled enough to be able to manually removed most viruses if I need to if I actually care about my computer.  THe crazy thing is, the people who actually know how to fix their computers are smart enough to not get infected by viruses in the first place.

uuDloQnCaa	In safe mode do a system restore to before you scanned with superantispyware then install Avast and allow it to run a boot scan.    Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|14d0ad3dfdb4dd36a9f896b96a702e69aa	SaS was to me a whole lot of trouble...pop-ups to upgrade, do-this n' that, added features, and so on.

Fall back to it if the new addition causes misbehavior in your system.|`|QxERY26Laa	Beware of downloading any software like that.  There are many sites that claim to repair your system by doing a online scan.  Ignore them.  If you are in safe mode look in your add remove programs and remove the spyware software from your system and restart.  If when you restart and same message occurs then try logging in safe mode and go to system restore from start menu and restore your system to an earlier date before the incident happened.  If you want a legit spyware remover and system settings protector than get Spybot search and destroy.  It is very popular software and free also.  I've been using it for about two years now.  Also, download AVG antivirus software if you do not have a antivirus program installed.  Good luck.  Do not install any software from random sites like that they are all fake and will not help.|`|CKE9oLlZaa	well delete it and see what happens    I've read a few reviews and it aint so great but people like it cos it loads quickly and doesn't hog resources (cos its crap!)    After you get rid of it and if you are back on, get spybot S&D from softpedia, along with ccleaner for registry cleaning and avira for your AV  (you must remove any AV software first.)    I'm really sorry you have had this experience.     PS spybot takes a while to run but is excellent. Remove unnecesary files/programs first to speed up AV scans.|`|eTLG23N4aa	It sounds to me that your computer is infected worse than what you think. I have never used superantispyware but i believe it's a good program. In the process of removing your infection it probably also removed vital system files in order to clean the operating system.   I would try booting into safe mode and do a system restore, or better still get what you want off of it and reformat and reinstall Windows.   I would have used Malwarebytes to remove your infection.|`|5fkqsnBJaa	Obviously, something went horribly wrong during that scan with SUPER (which by the way is  an excellent program, used by millions). SUPER may have mistakenly deleted a needed system file, look in the quarantine and restore any that are Windows files and see if that clears up the problem.    This is why we quarantine, and not delete....just in case of a mistake!     IF you continue to  have issues, You could preform a System Restore to before you used SUPER Antispyware. It will restore the malware that SUPER just removed but it will also restore any Windows files it may have deleted by mistake.    Uninstalling the SUPERAntiware program itself will have no effect.    BTW, the dude with the 'helmut' avatar is recommending two of the worst anti-malware programs.

Q5s2Pkz4aa	youtube only accepts video.. but you can easily create video with your song/picture with movie maker...    --- This will help you....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/lyric/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

But another way to get the youtubers attention is to upload your mp3 in another site (or know the URL If you downloaded the song) and edit any description and add the URL to the song. You can also do it in a video. Just use Windows Movie Maker (wmm) and import the song into the library. Then add some information about the mp3 by adding credits whether in the beggining or in the end. For Example; 'Song: Lonely, Artist: Akon'. (credits are useful for lyrics If you would like to add them). There should be information in the wmm display. (If you edit it properly and carefully enough, viewers may slightly enjoy listening to the music). Once you finished making the video, click 'save to computer' (Or publish it If you're using vista). I recommend you save it on your desktop and save it as a high quality in order to make your video easier to upload. speaking of that, once you saved your video, you are now ready to upload the video on youtube. Let your video retrieve alot of views.|`|dd7a6b1296760b08bd746b164b6c8787aa	you have to create a video file first using windows movie maker. you can add captions to you mp3 too.

For classes, I would suggest you look for ones that teaches you the basics like how to code in HTML, how to use tools like Notepad, Adobe Photoshop , Flash or Flex, Dreamweaver. Teach concepts like web hosting, SEO , domain registration etc.     I hope that helps.|`|m18E3CMDaa	First learn HTML. This is the foundation of all websites. Once you have a good grasp on HTML, I'd then suggest learning CSS. Tutorials on both of these can be found all over the Internet. One site I like is HTML Dog. This site covers HTML and CSS.    http://www.htmldog.com/    Once you have learned the technical aspects, then move on to web design theory. In other words, learn what makes a good website as opposed to a bad one. Again, you can find plenty of articles online.    You might also want to invest in some software like Photoshop and Dreamweaver. Programs like these will make your life a lot easier, once you know what to do with them.    Lastly, I'll mention the difference in web design vs web development. Design focuses on creating the overall look and feel of a site, while development is about writing the actual code that makes a site functional. Since you are a beginner, you may not know which aspect you want to focus on. The good news is that the training for both start the same. You'll need a good understanding of HTML and CSS either way. As you learn think about what interests you more: How the site looks or how the site works?

IC0ELEmjaa	Well, "Cheap Gaming Laptop" is a double oxymoron.  Not only are laptops very inconvenient for gaming (You can't upgrade the graphics card to play newer games =( found that out the hard way) and those that do play games well aren't cheap, including desktops, top-of-the-line is Alienware and those cost like infinity bajillion dollars.  If you want a video, music, picture-laptop there are ones out there for less than 500 dollars and you can buy a huge (1TB) external hard drive for less than $180.  If you want gaming, go desktop, but for a 10th birthday that may be a little too young to have a laptop.|`|nhftr3j2aa	Sorry bud but for all i know, the lowest gaming laptop price for one was $800, i buy my comps and laps at ibuypower.com, you should check it out they have good laps for gaming and videos.|`|U9QTcTvFaa	Dell is probably not best known for its gaming notebooks but the Inspiron XPS Extreme (& XPS Notebooks) can hold its own against the more stylist brand names.

Then you can drag and drop any video files onto the box or add them from the button.  Good luck.|`|I199P9yMaa	(ignore this if it doesn't apply)    if your aim is to make a bootable dvd like the ones you rent from blockbuster:      You would need to convert it to an image file using a conversion program if you want it to play in a standard dvd player if it is not already.  If it is in .wmv, .mp4, .avi, etc., you will need to convert it first unless Nero already does that for you  (which to my knowledge it does not).      Also, stay away from Limewire, it may be fast and easy, but the RIAA and MPAA are all over it now, so it's very risky to be downloading from gnutella network.|`|XRgmpvweaa	You can download many free videos on the following sites:  http://www.dvd-video-converters.com/free...

Just because the socket is the same is no guarantee it will support a new processor.

AA11514979	The CMOS battery is a batter on the motherboard.  It's like a watch battery or calculator battery, about the size of a nickel.  This stores your system settings, such as RAM timings, date and time, and processor settings (voltages, FSB speed, etc).  If your system is overclocked, pulling the battery will reset the timings.  In all other cases, the worst it will do is reset the time.    You know you can just enter the BIOS and adjust the time manually, right?  Press Del (or F12) on startup, when it says "Enter Setup"  Set the time, save and exit.    This issue might be PunkBuster or some other type of DRM/anti cheating software.  Find out if you need to patch the game or update Punkbuster manually.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Every PC since IBM's 1984 AT has had an internal clock backed by a lithium battery. Some programs check this clock to see what date it is, and refuse to run if the time is far in the future or past, presumably to prent bugs from manifesting. You can change this clock setting by double-clicking the clock on your taskbar and making sure your PC's set to 2009.|`|xJnD7of4aa	The CMOS battery is a Quarter-Dollar sized battery (usually a CR2013) or something.    It basically keeps your motherboard/CPU settings and computer clock(Date) running when your computer is unplugged.    Computers that have been unplugged (or Power supply switched off) for long periods can drain this battery...     You can get this in most electronic stores, and if you open your computer case, you'll see it nearly straight away... Manufacturers tend to make it quite visible, in the corner of something
AA11937417	well, you can do it the easier way by downloading a program that does it for you, but.... you can also create a bot using C++ to specifically time a process so that you can launch the process even when you are gone and the mouse would have to be programmed to move to the startbar and press logoff.

This not only means the video, audio, and etc, but the actual motherboard, memory (RAM) and hard drive size.       I've bought a few laptops from Craigslist and then went to the websites with model and serial numbers and found that the motherboards don't support XP at all.       Step 1 = check with the Mfr website and see if it will handle it by the motherboard, or if it needs a BIOS update, and dload the new XP drivers for the other hardware while You're there.       Step 2 = Make sure it has at least all this ;  Pentium 233Mhz or Pentium2 at 300+Mhz, 128 megs of RAM, a 6+Gig hard drive, and a CDROM drive that supports a 700meg CD instead of a limt of 650 megs.       Added note : If it's really a scrape by to pass this list, You're better off keeping ME and putting in the time to find some grewat old DOS games like Doom, Duke Nukem 3D, Shadow Warriow, Rise of the Triad, and Tetris, among other retro games. There's even Mines of Titan, Mechwarrior, and lots of other series that ran on DOS, and had huge followings.         Step 3 = Create a DOS bootdisk from WinME. It will work better this way, although You can just run the CD and use the update feature unless it;s an OEM disc.       Use the DOS bootdisk, place the CD in the drive, and run d:/oem386/setup.exe       This is the DOS-accessible setup routine for XP, No prior Windows OS required to run.                         Good Luck!.
LPxJRQuLaa	You will need a program to use that type of file. You can use many different programs, such as MagicISO, PowerISO, Daemon Tools, or Alchohol. Search Google for the programs and how to use them, they are fairly easy.    I suggest to try Daemon Tools and add a virtual drive to your computer and mount the ISO onto there, and if that doesn't work you can try one of the others listed above. All of those programs are either free or are free trials.|`|xJnD7of4aa	It's a CD image, windows won't do it natively    WinRAR will do it.

USoSCTdhaa	Windows XP is by far better in speed, resources, and perfomance|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	I don't know why, but I don't think you can generalize. I've seen some computers where XP runs like lightning compared to Ubuntu and others where the opposite is the case.    One thing's for sure, though: if you use Xfce or IceWM (instead of Ubuntu's default Gnome), Ubuntu will certainly be faster.|`|sSEy6KYiaa	Ubuntu is more lightweight.|`|3KQVz6Rtaa	Ubuntu uses less resources.|`|fb1a57ed0e8097a66606d3a50ae0a779aa	Most Linux distros are much more lightwieght than Windows XP. Ubuntu is definitely faster and, since you can configure swap space on a partition versus Windows' "paging file", uses memory more efficiently.
Vt0xnuWpaa	Go for the LED display. The LED LCD costs a bit more because it uses LED technology to light the display. Normal displays use a CCFL LCD bulb.    LED LCDs also last longer, are THINNER, and use less energy than the CCFL displays. LED quality and color is also more brilliant than the standard CCFL display.    ---    Yes, that drive plays DVDs and CDs, but not BluRays.    However, don't order the Lightscribe. What it does it allows you to burn images straight onto a disk - so that you have a nifty design on one side. However, this only works with special lightscribe CDs which tend to be costly. You might never even get around to using the Lightscribe function. You might as well get a regular DVD+/-RW or the BluRay read/write drive.    ---    The price may be a bit steep. If it's over $1300 without any warranty, you might want to look around for a less expensive laptop. The graphics card isn't that great. You can probably get most of that hardware you've listed there for closer to around $1000.     I mean, you could get a totally bomb gaming laptop from Gateway (P-FX series) with better hardware than that for the price of $1300    A NOTE ABOUT HARDDRIVE SPACE. The advertised storage is not the actual storage. When it displayed that you only had 360GB of space, that's the real amount. When advertising, they consider 1000MB as equal to 1GB - they round down to get a neat number and to inflate the number of storage; however, in reality 1024MB = 1GB. Then, some of that space is used up for pre-installed programs, drivers, and Operating System files.|`|FuGD0C5uaa	Just so you know, if you had a 360HD in the first place and it has less than that when you get it, its because the hard drive had to be formatted and the operating system takes up space as well. This is the same on all computer.   If the computer is slow, its most likely due to user-error. However, if this is a new hp computer and it is running a bit slow, you have a 1yr warranty that comes with it, so i would recommend calling HP and asking them about why it could be running so slow.|`|AA11620962	Looks fine to me...regular brightview|`|dXZOTXaFaa	you should get an intel core 2 processor
vDPCNimoaa	Your computer probably works with this video card, as long as you have a free pci-express slot. I also think you should upgrade your powersupply, 300w is probably not enough. But who knows? I have a Hp m8200n media center pc with 300w and I'm running an nvidia 8800gs which requires like 400w. Hp powersupplys say they are only 300w but they actually have much more power than it says. I'm also overclocking my video card by 100+Mhz and no glitches at all|`|2YsKHSpkaa	I just saw this on another question. The Video card will work with a 300 watt power supply (450 if going dual, but you prob dont have that option with that pc)    Find out what your power supply is, which it probably is 300 watt maybe 350 tops.  If so the website said you should be ok.|`|xruBwbXHaa	no|`|6opidS31aa	you need more power
OlfVNTuYaa	There are lots of people who claim to be.    My personal opinion is somebody you probably haven't heard of - his name is Evan Carmichael. The reason why is that he's making way too much money to bother selling his "secret" to anyone else. You might want to check out his website though - www.evancarmichael.com. I don't know for sure how much he's making, but it is significant.    I've been lucky enough to attend some of the (free believe it or not) seminars that he occasionally does. I thought I knew my stuff before. I learned a lot.|`|6PVFDHnzaa	well it depends on what content your website is geared for. are you attracting mainly males or females is the first question. if males then usually the dating banner adds bring the most $$.     sorry i couldn't add more, your question is very big and i'm not sure if i'm understanding what you want.

IC0ELEmjaa	Well, first off, laptops will work fine for everything except gaming, unless you plan to pay in excess of $1000, which you evidently do.  Laptops, as I found out the hard way with BioShock, cannot receive new graphics cards, which is one of the most important thing when it comes to gaming (except for RAM). However, if you choose some of the better options on this and plan to make it last, this would be great. I suggest at least 4GB of DDR2 RAM to play games, the graphics card will most likely last at least 2 more years, and I honestly wish my laptop had an HDMI port.  Sounds good, and seems as cheap as it'll get.  Unless you need it now, I would suggest waiting for the summer and getting a similar model.|`|UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Check the compaq on www.radioshack,com|`|pNu1yDWxaa	Hands down the best laptop for all that for a good price is the Dell Xps studio or m1530 laptops. They are well built, have great designs and are loaded with processing power. I highly recommend you check it out. I have one so can personally account for all those points.

That is one set of problems.     Another set of problems is that, increasingly, potential employers, and also some tertiary institutions are checking out job applicants, or college/ university entrants' face book sites to see if they are the sort of person they would like working for them, or are a suitable student for their college / uni.     There has already been one instance of a young man's face book entry being tampered with, and he is now facing losing his place at uni, because of (untrue) suggestions of inappropriate sexual behaviour on his part.    There is also the problem of people having hundreds of facebook 'friends', and competing with each other for how many 'friends' they have. Problem is these are not 'real' friends. It can seriously mess with young peoples' self esteem to be added / removed as 'friends' and allows for a lot of bitchy and unpleasant behaviour.

SJM0rzHtaa	Not sure why you insist on overcomplicating things by trying to use both the HD4350 and the IGP.    The HD4350 has two video outputs and is perfectly capable of driving two display devices.  Just connect both the monitor and the projector to the 4350.|`|H8bfXVChaa	With the HD4350 you should have got a DVI converter. Check the box you got it in.    Once you have slotted both the projector and monitor. Now go to display settings and select the "settings" tab.    You should see 2 monitor in it named 1,2.    Click on "Identify" to identify which display is number 1. If the number 1 is for the monitor then number 2 is the projector.    Select the projector and put it to a low res for now, like 800x600. and then click on "Extend my desktop" and click on apply.    It should work.  All the best.    P.S. Once the main setup is working you can change the projector resolution to your preference.|`|vUsVieulaa	You need to go into your BIOS and look for an option to enable onboard graphics.

E0chY1b5aa	You should have to connect to the network.  If it's a secure network you'll have to enter the key.    Hope that helps.|`|xdlsGvldaa	No you do not have to register your added network card or if it is made into your lap top you did this when you registered the lap top. If using the wireless WiFi at home you have to have a wireless router installed to your modem or a gateway ( a gate way is a router modem combo unit). If you locate a close network that is not secured with a password you can connect to it, this is called piggy backing/stealing a connection. You can connect free from any place like a airport, library, hotel, coffee shop that has free WiFi wireless.  Hope this helps
EBY5XvRGaa	On the back of the computer, near the plug there should be an on/off switch (it may say I/O). Make sure that's on.    Also, there will be a red switch below it.  It is very unlikely that you accidentally switched it, but it's worth checking.  It should be set to 110V in the U.S.  In Europe, 220V is more common. If you're not sure, look up your country on the chart I am linking you to, and see what it says for "Voltage."    You may also want to try another outlet (preferably in another room.)  You would be surprised how often this can solve the problem.|`|cpavWbc3aa	double check that the switch on the back of the powersupply unit, located in the rear of the PC is set to the on mode, also, unplug the power cord from the back of the computer, count to 10 plug it back in and try again.

Then report it to windows site.|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...

uuDloQnCaa	How to remove Fake Software, Pop-Ups, Spyware, Trojans and Viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete what ever they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use.

854662b4b6098e523f95f5d734db611eaa	To get the "alt" on all browsers:    ALT shows "mytext" in IE if the image is there.  ALT shows "mytext" in all other browsers ONLY if the image is NOT there.  TITLE shows "mytext" on all browsers except IE.  You must put BOTH tags!  That way, you don't need conditional comments: the browser ignores what it does not understand.  Other example:    BOTH argument AND style are required to get them to work on all browsers.  This, unfortunately, will prevent W3C validation: the argument "bgcolor" does not "exist" in w3C!  But, what is important? a nice W3C certificate and a site that does not work on 50% of browsers, or not certification and a satisfied client, seeing your site correctly on ALL browsers, including MAC, Chrome and Safari?    For the rest of tags, be specific: there are too many of them!|`|7bf62358ee706efffb78c25a9c7d5a00aa	Most web browsers will render well-formed code correctly - IE won't, in a lot of cases.  Google conditional comments.|`|hWCa87MSaa	Hey, man. You have a URL this is being made on? As far as alt codes in Firefox, they don't show up on mouse over. Not real sure why...it's something I've come to accept.     The issue with designing websites is that nearly EVERY browser has implemented it's own method if carrying out web standards and rendering. A  tag in firefox may give you a return to the next line and nothing in IE, while using two  will render one in IE and two in firefox.    Play around with adding additional tags...that's about as good as it gets if you're using straight HTML, as far as I know. I'd recommend learning CSS. ;)|`|m18E3CMDaa	This is part of the joy of web development. All browsers are not created equal. They handle things differently. If you get into web development, this will be one of the issues you must deal with. There are a lot of good articles online about cross-browser compatibility. You might want to read up on that. For right now, make sure all your br and img tags are closed with a forward slash, like this:    
sv64Uy3Saa	Your PC's motherboard is using the Nvidia chipset that has Geforce 6150SE integrated on the chipset that is why others would say it is on the motherboard. Integrated graphics are quite weak for gaming and they just share memory from system RAM.    The 8400GS dedicated graphics card should work on your PC. It is a significant upgrade over your 6150SE. However, the 8400GS is still just an entry level or budget graphics card. More serious gaming starts with the ~$85 cards like the ATI HD 4670 or the Geforce 9600GT.|`|xBuwM4awaa	yes ur computer will run with that video card. Btw NVIDIA GeForce 6150SE is a mother board

When you are downloading many files, running many searches and all that combined, it is quite possible that Limewire's memory usage on your computer will spike, subsequently slowing down your computer.    It doesn't do it inherently, no. There are times when it can though.    I know that Limewire uses anywhere from 50-125MB of RAM when it's running. If you only have 512MB of RAM, it's quite possible it will slow down your computer.|`|IRFaBtr4aa	Yes, LimeWire does slow down the computer. It uses up quite a bit of mem usage. Using limewire isn't good because there are a high risk of viruses too. Clean out your computer regularly.

1UJDqjKJaa	You are going to want to boot your computer into safe mode before you do any scanning for the spyware.    Reboot your machine and while it is booting up hold the F8 key on your keyboard.  It will bring up a list.  Choose Safe Mode from the list.  It will load only what is necessary to get into windows, eliminating all spyware from messing with your scanner.

peFufWeYaa	You would have to enter them manually with the different columns for title, artist, genre, tag, etc and this would all take some time, I would offer a better solution to you.    If you download MusicMatch one of the best features it has is it's customizable and searchable music library feature. It will sort and search by artist, gere, tag, etc make playlists, and will serve  you better than what I think are trying to do with excel, and best of all, you can do it with just one click!    All you need is to have all your tunes in one folder then install MusicMatch and tell it the location of the folder. Done.    P.S. You can also edit the song name and tag info in MusicMatch as well    Here is the link, I suggest version 7.2
Cddqq9dBaa	You need to format the drive which will erase everything on the PC. So if you have any files on the pc that you want to keep, you will need to copy them to a disc because they will be gone with everything else once you format the drive.    Do you have the original operating system disc for the laptop?? It is very important to have that before you format it. It also will require the product key to install it. On my laptop it is on the bottom on a windows label.    If you have those two things you can proceed to format the drive. Then reinstall your operating system. You may also want to Google your question for other methods.    Put the disc in your drive then turn off your pc. turn it back on and select boot from cd. At the Welcome to Setup page, press Enter. Press F8 to accept the Windows XP Licensing Agreement. You'll be asked if you want to repair your existing Windows XP installation. Press ESC to bypass the repair and install a fresh copy. All your existing disk partitions will be listed.    You want to delete the current partition where Windows is installed. Use the arrow key to select it, and press D to delete it. Press L to confirm. Then, to create a new partition, select the unpartitioned space and press C. To create a new partition with the maximum amount of space allotted to it, press Enter.    Now select the brand new partition you've just created to install Windows on. Format the drive in FAT or NTFS doesn't really matter. Then, follow Windows Setup's steps until it asks you to log in for the first time. Congratulations! Welcome to your fresh new Windows installation.|`|AVCeK28Faa	yup you could do the first dude said but make sure you have the drivers for your hardwares ^_^  or if you still have the disk they gave you when you buy the pc or laptop you could do system recovery. less hassle than installing a new operating system.

5dYrLs45aa	Antivirus 2009 (or 2008, or Antivirus XP2009 or Antivirus 360 or SmitFraud or dozens of other names - there are many clones of this rogue software) is a piece of malware that infects your computer and constantly pops up notices that you have an infection and you have to buy or update Antivirus 2009. This is a scam to trick you into paying $30 for some useless software.  The malware installed when you downloaded something from the web, sometimes masquerading as a video codec or other useful software. It is persistent, and infects a number of Windows files.    It is too clever to just delete it or add/remove it. It may even block your Task Manager and block Internet access to antivirus sites.    First download the following (if the virus is blocking your internet, you may have to download these on another machine and burn to CD or copy to a USB memory stick)     Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    Superantispyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...    CCleaner (cleans out caches)  http://www.ccleaner.com    Avast! 4 Home: http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...    Now, **start the machine in Safe Mode** (hit the F8 function key as the machine boots up, and choose Safe mode)    Turn off System Restore on your machine, but only until you get this fixed - many of these trojans get copied into the System Restore files, which anti-virus programs aren't allowed to touch and the viruse could reinstall themselves from there. My Computer > Properties > System Restore.    Then run CCleaner (it'll make scanning faster because it will delete a bunch of temp files and save you from having to scan those.)    Then run Malwarebytes, and clean everything it says.    Then in stall and run Avast - tell Avast to do a boot-scan - click on "schedule boot-scan" - and restart the computer    Let it start and do the Avast boot scan    Then install and run Superantispyware    Then turn System Restore back on.    Now install the antivirus program and antispyware program of your choice to do continuous scanning, and make sure you keep it up to date.     Always keep your Windows, web browser and Java software up to date - frequent patches are released to plug security holes.   http://www.pcworld.com/article/149298/10...

They often keep the malware from protecting itself.    Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Good luck.|`|NuiHXYuOaa	safe mode (tapping f7 on boot) >> Run >> MSCONFIG    disable all 'startup' programs by unticking.    restart the machine.    try spybot again. when spybot is done >> enable what you want to startup on boot again in msconfig. change your wallpaper.    if it still persists dont waste ur time - get your stuff and do a format.|`|hQppQFILaa	copy your info from my document folder....mine did that and wiped it out completely.....IT ATTACKS YOUR 'MY DOCUMENTS' FOLDER....BACK UP FILES NOW!!!|`|IRFaBtr4aa	You probably have no other choice than to re-format your computer.

Make sure that your XP box is set up to automatically download and install security patches.|`|Cddqq9dBaa	Start you computer in safe mode and then run SpyBot. It has to be in safe mode. If that doesn't work I suggest to format the drive and reinstall windows. There are ways to manually get rid of this stuff, you just have to google alot. Some of these warnings are ways to get you to buy a product claiming only that product can remove certain trojans and spyware, some are spyware themselves. SpyBot is a great free program.    I haven't used any anti virus in well over a year with no problems that Spy Bot can't remove. So I have no problems.  Get to know you computer and the files and it will help you alot in the future. Also you should try FireFox  to use as your web browser and then get the addon NoScript.    Get familiar with what programs run in task manager so when you see a new one pop up out of nowhere you can disable it.    Most spyware and trojans run at startup, so you can try disabling certain programs. Try this:    Left click START, then click RUN, type MSCONFIG hit ok,     Select STARTUP and you will see a list of programs that start with Windows.    Decide which ones you don`t want to start and check the checkbox next to them.    You can also click on the sevices tab check the box that says hide all Microsoft sevices. You will then see what is running along side Windows, again you can check anything that you don`t want.    When you have finished click on apply then ok.

It is hard to install any type of anti virus program when the PC is already infected. back up all your data to a separate drive like an external disk.  reformat the PC With the restore CDs (usually this will reinstall all the system drivers). Once the OS is restored GET A QUALITY ANITVIRUS! call your ISP, most ISPs will give you a free good anti virus and spyware program that is better than the free junk (avg free edition is garbage).

Ignore ALL messages it says about bad security, and viruses, etc.    Don't bother downloading another Antivirus, as the major ones will probably be blocked....

Go to your windows\Prefetch directory and delete all files inside it.    Reboot in Safe mode.    Go to C:\Documents & settings\[your username]\Application data and delete anything with stupid names, or anything you recognize as not being something you installed.    Do the same for Documents and settings\[username]\Local Settings\Application Data    And again for Documents and settings\[username]\Local Settings\Temp    For the above 3, you are looking primarily for .exe files.    run regedit (if it works... if not try: http://www.kellys-korner-xp.com/regs_edi... go to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Wi... remove anything that looks odd.    Do the same for HKEY_CURRENT_USER\[the rest is the same].    Check your Task Manager (or download process explorer from sysinternals) Get rid of anything suspect.    Clear your Prefetch Folder again.    Reboot into normal mode.    Get some antispyware/antivirus programs (I use google pack's Spyware Doctor fore emergencies), and a reputable free Antivirus, but that changes.    If all that fails, it's probably time to wipe it and start again.

8gi5gfOsaa	You need only install the appropriate driver for your Mac and the OS you are using. You can get those drivers applicable to your situation at either Sharp's web site or Apple's if they list this printer as a compatible product for your machine. Don't be duped by the BS driver detectives and driver geniuses and driver robots and all the other superfluous vendor programs which prey on people who are lazy or less knowledgeable about obtaining and installing drivers than they should be.     Driver as used in this sense, is simply software coding that links peripheral devices with the operating system. Written by programmers who understand both the OS and the command language and structure of the peripheral device, this code contains the precise machine language necessary for the device to perform functions properly when requested by an application program. Both applications and operating systems are continuously being updated, thereby requiring that driver software be updated frequently as well.     Driver updates, are therefore, an indication of a hardware vendor's support system and ability to maintain compatibility with a wide and varying lot of both OS's and motherboard manufacturers. If they are seldom or never provided, find another component manufacturer.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	If it didn't come with a Install CD then go to the Sharp website and download the software.

pOaE0fWOaa	Maxtor drives in the past were not terribly reliable. I once had 3 fail on me in a month and none was even a year old. Back it up and get a new one , pronto. Your drive will fail and probably very soon. You don't need to buy a retail boxed one as the OEM in the static bags generally have longer warranties. Seagate who now owns Maxtor has had problems with recently with the 7200.11 series of drives so be warned. Western Digital has always enjoyed a good reputation. Hitachi GST makes very good drives for the last number of years. Samsung has again returned to good form. All offer similar warranty terms, now. Check around for prices, as there is movement in the marketplace.     For a short term solution, you might consider a refurb. These have been returned to the manufacturer and re-examined and fixed as necessary, then sold with a reduced warranty at a reduced price. I am currently using one as a back up drive over USB for the past 2 years.  YMMV.    Good luck.|`|5dYrLs45aa	Based on the description, you are not going to be able to fix it.

ylBZ7xevaa	Gmail's grouping of emails doesn't necessarily indicate that someone got a message that they shouldn't have. A conversation can be linked when it shares the same subject, for example.    It sounds like what may have happened is that (1) your friend forwarded a copy of your message to the other friend and that friend replied to you or to both of you (since the subject is the same, it'll end up in the same conversation), (2) you may have inadvertently added another person's email to the To or Cc field, or (3) you may have sent to a mailing list name rather than an individual email address. You can check the original email's To and Cc fields to see if it was an addressing error but it was probably a case of  1.

5a2XVczMaa	The best place to get "FREE" music is from iTunes. Go to the iTunes store and look for "Single of the week". It's free to download.    If you are looking for "illegal" Music, then you should change your question.    A good place to get illegal music is from a website called "Rapidshare" or "Megaupload"  It's great for downloading albums and compilation CD's (things like the "So Fresh" CD's or whatever)    Go to Google and type the name of the album + rapidshare after it.  With rapidshare (or megaupload) your pretty much guaranteed to get the album (no drop outs on the download or anything).    If u need more guidance, email me from my yahoo answers page.|`|HMTwGqxQaa	Google it it's called Q TRAX or TRAC|`|uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!      Good luck & happy downloading!|`|ihPxVG6Uaa	I have tried a number of softwares but the best one is bit torrent. It consumes less resources and virus free. You can get it from   www.bittorrent.com  Then go to www.isohunt.com to get the music you want..  Another good software is Limewire which can be found from www.limewire.com but it consumes more PC resources and makes computer bit slow...|`|AURdGqFnaa	First off illegally downloading the music always runs a risk of downloading Trojans or like bugs. What you can do is download software called uTorrent( if you have Windows) or Transmission. (If you have Mac) They both download in the .torrent file format so they can produce quick results. You will most likely be downloading Albums or compliations at a time, rather than single songs. Get one of these and look for Torrent hosting sites eg: "thepiratebay.org" or "isohunt.com". Always be smart about your downloads, READ COMMENTS, and scan with antivirus software if you have any. Happy thievery!

Cc2Yb9DKaa	Without testing for particular conditions, it's hard to say for sure what the problems is or how to solve it.    I thought the best way to answer this question would be to share my experience with wireless network connectivity problems.  I have a Dell Inspiron and an HP Pavillion with wireless adapters on a wireless network router.  My neighbors have the same model of router and, occasionally, I have problems connecting.  Another problem I have is connecting to same type of wireless router on a different network.  Sometimes, my PC will connect to the network, but not to the Internet, because the network is not secure.  Or, too many connections confuse the router--in which case, you should unplug the router for 30 seconds and plug it back in.      One solution I found involves disconnecting from any network, or shutting off the wireless adaptor and turning it back on.  This initializes the wireless adapter to detect networks.  Radio interference from malfunctioning appliances, other wireless devices with failing batteries (such as wireless keyboards and mouses, wireless telephones, etc.) or many of the same routing devices in a small area (such as an apartment building) can cause problems with signal clarity, thus causing the network adapter from property syncing to the network.    You may have to try a plug-in wireless adapter.  A USB-wireless adapter comes with an extension cord, allowing you to situate the receiver in a place that is less affected by the RF interference.  They also pick up a stronger signal than built-in adapters typically provide.    I hope this helps!      If you need information about other IT topics, read more at http://www.associatedcontent.com/user/42...|`|0SOjx0YBaa	For desktops, make sure they have a wireless card installed or that they have a wireless usb adapter.

Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.

Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...

3an2RBWuaa	not really...    the 8600gt was decent, the 8800gt for alittle bit more money was pretty damn good.  The 8800gt performs better than the 9600gt, and is just about the same as the 9800gt, except the chip size.. it gives off less heat, and has minor updates.. peformance is very close.    According to your power supply, I would get either an 8600gt or 9600gt.  If you have a good power supply, get the 8800GT, 9800GT is going cheap on tigerdirect.com and probably newegg.com as well.

UV8bN0Giaa	Yes, my 1st ever Notebook PC was an expensive Gateway Pentium IV and I had the most difficult time finding parts..    You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|40476bfd77edbf89d83d72a04dd3c141aa	you could find better, if you add about $100 and buy brand new from best buy or something...if he lets it go for bout 300$ its not bad...    peace|`|6PVFDHnzaa	how much is it?????????????    he doesn't say or i'm blind.    wouldn't pay anymore then $500 for it...MAX. what i'd do is go to newegg.com and watch there "recertificated" section for a laptop just like the one on craigslist and buy it from newegg. that way you can alway return it if something goes wrong. but yea.... i highly recommend not getting Vista!

Don't forget best answer! =)|`|sUIrVFipaa	Here's a quote from an article at Tomshardware for their December 2008 roundup.  The Url is http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/core...    "As wed hoped, performance scales directly to dollars spent, but not proportionally. Performance increases are almost linear whereas build-cost increases are exponential. Doubling our $625 PC budget produced a 78% performance gain in the $1,250 PC, but doubling the $1,250 budget gave our $2,500 PC only a measly 13% gain. Overclocking helped the $2,500 PC more than the rest, but  the value of high-end systems is always somewhat questionable."    The thing to realize is they are talking about buying parts and building the system yourself.  If you don't want that, then I reccomend that you have atleast one friend who is geeky enough to "enjoy" building your computer for you, and you could offer them a couple twenty's for the pleasure of doing it.  Even if you give them a $100 for it, it would still be cheaper then most retail.    BTW, Alienware is mainly for the overclocked watercooled system that you are willing to pay $3500 or more.  If you aren't being charged for that kind of quality, then they will just hit you for being a specialty brand name.  There is no such thing as a "budget" Alienware Gamer PC, in my opinion.  Just go to their website and hit customize.|`|drK8uyzsaa	dell xps 430, it has the goodies, can be customized and starts at 999.00. can view it at dell.ca|`|FYkPsANTaa	good question...

For what it's worth, you can have various shapes without any kind of background. What you do is make the background transparent.|`|WS95be3Raa	All images are rectangles. You can make them seem to have a shape by introducing transparent background, though not all formats support it.    Why can't computers have a support for different image shapes? Simple. There's no way to specify such image's dimensions.    Rectangular images are easy for computer to understand - you give it 2 numbers (width and height) and that's it. With different shapes, you'd have to find a way to describe them with a fixed amount of numbers.

But this does not mean the image itself can't be a triangle, circle, or whatever.    To create a triangular picture, just take a rectangular space, fill it with background, and put a triangle in it. Your picture is now a triangle.    You say "it's always against the white background of a quadrilateral". Yeah, so what? If you put something on your desk, it will always be against the background of the shape of your desk. But that's because your desk is square, not because everything you put on it is square.

f6204b72e7382003fd2ede447a81eeb6aa	It could be several things. My intuition on this is some kind of malware has damaged the core files firefox is using for internet browsing. My best advice is to uninstall Firefox, and use IE to download the latest version.  Other advice... Before you double-click Fox, hit CTRL+SHIFT+ESC, (assuming XP) this will bring up the Task Manager, click on the Processes tab and then click on the CPU heading twice. This will sort the various processes/programs running on your system (yes, there is a lot going on!) in descending order. Then when you double click Firefox, you should see some changes. In particular look for FIREFOX.EXE. If it is still showing after the brief hourglass, then at least you know that it is trying, but something (driver, other process, corrupted setting) is stopping it and you should focus on trying to clean your system up.|`|OilQvoLZaa	Because it just doesn't like you.

UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|ykXzzx65aa	if u going to spend 2 grand on a laptop, get XPS, u can get a kick *** comp for 2 grand that is MUCH better than a mac book|`|pNu1yDWxaa	I am on a dell xps and can personally say it is the most reliable laptops I have used.

AA11976863	For any mass file transfer, it's a good caution to create a backup user account and turn off automatic login. Be sure you know both passwords. If you make some mistake in copying files, you can login to the backup account to fix things.    An external USB drive is fine but things will go three times as fast and much smoother using a Firewire connection. Connect the two computers by Firewire cable if neither is a 2008 aluminum laptop (no FW on the new ones). Restart the one you will sell while holding the T key. When you see the huge FW icon on its screen, release the T. On the other Mac, open a Finder Window to see the mounted drive of "for sale" Mac. Drag what you want to the "keep" Mac. If the home folders are the same name (don't try to rename either one), you will have it easy. If not, keep your fingers crossed. After files are copied, shut down the "for sale" Mac. Open Disk Utility on "keep" and repair permissions. That might take quite a long time.|`|rMs4WBfcaa	Memory stick
bVZ7uZjJaa	Sorry this does not answer your question exactly - but I wanted to help you question if it was worth installing in the first place ... it seems to be faulty at best, and loaded with spam/pop ups at worse.    I don't have this application installed, but the general consensus is that it is not worth installing in the first place.  Here is just one users review (many others have similar complaints):    HORRIBLE, A WASTE OF TIME, AND ILLEGAL ADVERTISING.  by Sam Eisenberg at 1:25pm on January 4th, 2009  This application is a waste of time and has an unbelievable amount of dangerous loop holes and flaws.  The two main problems? 1. IT LIES ABOUT RESULTS. 2. IT'S A CHEAP WAY FOR DESPERATE WOMEN/MEN TO FIND A DATE OR TRACK/STALK SOMEONE. To test this, I had a buddy of mine bring her laptop over, and use the compare application. I logged in on my laptop, so did she. She opened the application, and compared until I myself was involved in a question. First off, You are NOT compared to your "friends" even 70 percent of the time. My friend was asked the question, "who would you rather date?" The choices were either me, or a random woman in her 50's dressed in very skimpy lingerie, whom neither of us knew at all. My friend checked the box for me, moved on to the next question, then exited the application. I, on my own account, logged in and checked my notifications. I was "compared." I clicked to see the results, after fighting 3 or 4 pop-ups that will never stop appearing when you open the application until you sign up for whatever it's offering. I clicked to view my results. "Who would I rather date?" YOU LOST.

MvnfQ5B0aa	ere are some tips that may help you along the way:       1. You must be a registered user to create a new article. Unregistered (anonymous) users can request new articles at our Articles for Creation department.     2. Try editing existing articles to get a feel for writing and for using the mark-up language in use at Wikipedia.     3. Search Wikipedia first to make sure that an article does not already exist on the subject, perhaps under a different title. If the article already exists, feel free to make any constructive edits you feel are necessary.     4. Gather references both to use as source(s) of your information and also to demonstrate notability of your article's subject matter. References to blogs, personal websites and MySpace don't countwe need reliable sources.     5. Consider requesting feedback. You can request feedback on articles you would like to create in a number of places, including the talk page of a related WikiProject or the Drawing Board.     6. Consider creating the article first in your user space As a registered user, you have your own user space. You can start your new article there, on a subpage; you can get it in shape, take your time, ask other editors to help work on it, and only move it into the "live" Wikipedia once it is ready to go. To create your own subpage, see here. When your new article is ready for "prime time", you can move it into the main area.      Hopefully it will help you.

ebuxHnScaa	I've never seen a motherboard with a PCI-E slot that didn't have at least one PCI slot. They probably exist, but they're certainly rare.    PCI is still used for sound cards, network interfaces, storage controllers, modems, and a variety of other devices.|`|kfnidL8vaa	i guess not...pci and pci-express have different physical features..if ur motherboard supports pci-e then it will support pci but there is no provision on the main board for pci graphic card or any other pci interface to fit...moreover wen one has pci-e then who needs pci...its much faster than pci or agp...good day :)|`|Qvg6Brc5aa	Yes, some motherboard types have both slots on the board.
I199P9yMaa	the white one is just a PCI slot, it's used for wireless cards, pci graphics cards (old tech), and soundcards, stuff like that.

UbY3C9Rpaa	A tip would be to upload the video as another name. I don't think YouTube will detect it.|`|zorYTX59aa	Unfortunately for you, any music that is not your creation and which   is used in your video is considered "copyright infringement". The big   music/media corporations such as UMG, Warner and Viacom don't  just "own" their music, they also own the "rights" to them, including  how and where "their music" can be publicly presented.    Thus, they're apparently 100% within their rights to claim the music   in your video as their own -- especially if you have not paid them for   "licensing fees", "distribution rights", "royalties", and/or "expressed   written permission" to use and "broadcast" their music on YouTube.    Even if you gave credits to the song, the artist and/or the label, that  should never be construed as an excuse or justification for you and   really YouTube to "break the law". You could contest the takedown  trying to claim that your video is for "personal use" only, but the big  corporation lawyers could ask some intriguing questions of you like  A) why did you upload your vid to YouTube; B) why did you, in their  minds, rip off "their music"; and C) how did you acquire that music?   Even if you bought it legally (and can prove it!), that does not entitle   you to, in their eyes, "distribute" it illegally for free -- or to have your   video potentially come across as though you may be a commercial  agent or official representative of theirs. It may not be your intention,   but for the copyright owner, you may be involuntarily defaming them,  the music or the artist.    If you're willing to take the chance and re-upload your video with the   same music, do not write the name of the song or artist in your title,  description, or tags. Also avoid irrelevant phrases like "no copyright   infringement intended", "I do not own the music" or "I don't take any   credit for this song". The upload servers at YouTube actively search   for words and sentences like that.    You should also consider the fact that the music-recording industry   is starting to use hidden "watermarks" or "fingerprints" buried within  their music, in order to uncover and identify their illicit use. As such,   it is possible that no matter how many times you try to upload your   video, it may always be rejected because of "copyright infringement".  You would thus be better off trying to find a different recording of the   music you want to use. If you've noticed that other videos are using   the exact same music, those videos were probably uploaded before   this new technology really started coming into being.    The only possible exception to everything that I've just written above   is for you to use music that is shorter than 30 seconds. If you listen   carefully to any talk-show on radio or TV, they will never use or play  other people's music for longer than 30 seconds when introducing a   guest or going into/out of commercials. Can you guess the reason?  (Hint: it has to do with "licensing fees" and "royalties".)    I hope my info has been helpful to you.|`|5XSmMXfkaa	If it's owned by Warner Music it's definitely not going to get up there.  The YouTube I.D. scans audio and video and compares it to a database, if it's owned by WMG, you might as well forget it.
HBAMQJPLaa	Building your own unit has a lot of satisfaction.  My first one was simple as there was only one processor then, the 8088, one socket and one type mother board.    You know what is inside and are not afraid to tackle problems i fyou build your own.    I am retired too and thinking of building my own again.  After that first build I just bought ready made from Gateway at first and now Dell as they have always served me well.    But if you feel comfortable go for it.

Opening this web site (Microsoft...etc) is slightly risky from assembled pc.  In other hand you can get all good parts for your PC in assembled one and its also in low price but you have no licence & guaranty & warranty in this case.  now a days licence in not important than the good computer.  You told that your range is in between 15000/- to 20000/-.    So in my opinion ASSEMBLED pc is best for you. Just collect some software discs like Operating system, Office...etc and some disc you will get with your ASSEMBLED PC like Nero, Drivers..etc and enjoy the internet.  Thank You Sir.

Try using the other alt key, if it does the same thing try a different keyboard, always try the simple things first before you start deleting files and reinstalling your operating system.

lHPdGgvTaa	Ram is worth getting (Stands for Random Access Memory)    You know how when you load a webpage, close it, then re-open it, it tends to load back up quite quickly? That's what your ram assists with, it's like your short term memory, anything that you're doing on your computer at that precise time temporarily gets stored in your ram so you can access it more quickly than if it was stored on your hard drive.    My computer had about 1.8 gigs of ram, now I upped it to 4 and the difference in speed is incredible.    Hope this has helped :)|`|Rh2th9zqaa	The more Ram that you have the faster your computer will operate. It also helps speed things up when you have many applications open.|`|812793fbbb1f4d6a8b07ee04d74ebb7daa	Well, ram is the way you speak to the computer, you speak in text, but your computer speak binary, so the ram does that for us, it translates everything from words to picture, music. so the more you have the better  ram:random-access memory, meaning it recycles back when done using.|`|I199P9yMaa	RAM, or random access memory, is very important.  The more the better.  Basically what it does is it takes the load off of your processor so you can do more intensive tasks without having to wait for the computer to load.  The standard amount nowadays is about 2GB, but I would go for 3 or 4 if possible.|`|PLVcRFzqaa	Say you have multiple things running on your computer such as a open word document, internet explorer page, excel spreadsheet, and aim. Well ram helps speed up your computer when you have a bunch of applications running on your computer simultaneously. 1.5 gbs of ram is OK, but anything below that really is'nt that good. I think the largest capacity of RAM (RANDOM, ACESS MEMORY) available is 4 gigabytes. Good Luck!!|`|7cm7pmAtaa	temporary storage of information waiting to go to and coming from the CPU before it goes to its appropriate location be it the monitor or the harddrive or the GPU     the reason it is needed is because of how incredibly slow the read write of the harddrive is in comparison    its a faster way of transporting memory information so that the CPU or GPU always have information to keep them working and not becoming idle|`|Z0lEv4Dzaa	RAM - Random Access Memory. Its the temporary storage of all running programs or ultilities you will be running in your computer.The amount of RAM your memory card contains will tell you how fast your computer will operate. Its like this. lets say you're playing a game in your computer which requires at least 100mb of RAM to run and your computer only has 256 mb of RAM?? Your game will still run but it will not still run smoothly because aside from the 100mb of RAM the game will be using, you still have other programs or components you will be running like MSPaint, Internet Explorer which will add to the 100mb your game requires.    lets say  100mb for game + 50 for another program + 50for another program = 200mb of ram. So you will only have  56mb remaining(56 is too low)    If you only have 256mb ram of memory card and your run all those three at the same time(make it active), you might experience your system to hang or pause because the remaining mb of ram will be very low.    I suggest that you buy a computer with 1gb or 2gb ram of memory.  And find a computer which has better graphics. At least 256mb ram of video card or 512mb for video card if you want(its more expensive)    Try to check also how much Ghz(Gigaheartz) your computer has. Buy something which has at least 3.0ghz. It will surely work fast.    and lastly buy a computer which has at least 40-100gb of hard disk drive for your storage.      Good Luck!|`|6m3PjQicaa	RAM is what your computer stores things it needs often in for quick access.  Short answer - more RAM = GOOD!|`|Gzoeh0O9aa	yes you want more ram, it will help your computer in being a lot faster. also another thing to look for is a fast cpu.|`|txC0y4BXaa	RAM is good.  The more the better.  The simple definition of RAM is it is the temporary memory of the computer.  The more RAM you have the more tasks you can do at one time.|`|MbfDuEmZaa	makes it faster, but your computer needs to support it which might mean a new processor|`|4iJNpxy9aa	yes, ram stores the files from your hardrive for the applications that are open so they run faster, more ram the better, for mac 2 gb is plenty but for pc vista u need 4 cause vista manages memory bad|`|6PSZDDrHaa	To put it simply the more the better, it allows you to run more applications at once, and it allows bigger programs like games to run smoothly...and to run windows vista, around 2gb is a good start|`|OL7Uu8Foaa	Ram make ur pc faster and faster.|`|P8QyLbRqaa	A memory ram is used for storing memory. like downloads or games ect.

zzFwZZtUaa	It is definitely against the rules to lie on Ebay as a seller (I am one). In my experience buying also I haven't had anyone lie to me in over 150 purchases. I would first message the seller asking if it was authentic, and if he says it is just look over the whole listing again just to make sure. If he/she says it's authentic it probably is. Watch out for words like this is an authentic Torino Lamborghini or something like that which could be talking about a different product that looks the same with a similar name that really is a clone.

EDIT:    I don't think it should be illegal if you're using it as your background, UNLESS it has the 'damagedscene' logo on the background or something, then it might be considered as theft of a background or something along those lines lol, but nothing illegal really, just find another background if it does have their logo on it, if not then you're are fine.

So you will be perfectly fine to use it.|`|AA11736483	Disk cleanup software is pretty harmless (and somewhat useless). There are common places (directories) within a PC where the software goes and deletes files. It also knows to delete .tmp (temporary) files.  I've never known any disk cleanup software to inadvertently delete something needed.|`|IrrmpSZYaa	no it don't clean useful data it cleans temp files try cc-cleaner

You would want to fully wipe it just in case anyway|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	Yes, it will get rid of viruses, just as a full reformat would.    Both a quick and full reformat get rid of Windows. The virus infects Windows, not your hardware. Though, I guess it's possible some virus could some attack your BIOS, but I don't know how it would live there. If that were the case, even a full reformat wouldn't help.|`|xHmSTT0eaa	I dont think it makes any difference you get a fresh file system either way.|`|7nmzxp4Iaa	If you are doing a full reformat then it will get rid of everything.

o8urk20jaa	You could buy a Nas box and set it up between them all and store all of your files there. If you mean boot from one drive than that would be much harder.|`|STw42PKyaa	yes definetly that laptop drive u want to share a common drive just right click on that & click on sharing & security and just enable the saring and now just go to my network place on other laptop and view workgroup computers open the computer on which u have shared the drive and right click on tht and clilck map network drive give it a name and like y z x whtevr and click ok to map the dive noe u can see this drive directly in my computer repeat this on all pc lp u want and enjoy a easy way of common drive sharing|`|W6ZrNUt2aa	yes it is. you have to set up file sharing on each computer. create a folder and set up sharing, or simply pull it into the shared folders area. How this is called depends on your operating system: vista or xp. On XP it is "Shared Documents" and is automatically shared.    In XP you can run network setup wizard (under accessories) on one computer to create a home network with file sharing. The you save the settings on a usb stick and run the settings on each home network computer. Form then on you should be able to see the shares from each computer.
Px0hcqfwaa	In this new internet generation, the probability of getting a virus is greater than 60 percent. Any file hosting service such as sendspace could definitely get a virus.

axoPWEo8aa	Ok, according to HP's site it says your boyfriend has an AGP slot for the video card. The spores specs are as follows.    FOR WINDOWS XP    * 2.0 GHz P4 processor or equivalent    * 512 MB RAM    * A 128 MB Video Card, with support for Pixel Shader 2.0    * At least 4 GB of hard drive space, with at least 1 GB additional space for creations.   He meets all but one which is the video card requirement.  The video card requirements are as follows      Supported Video Cards    NVIDIA GeForce series    FX 5900, FX 5950    6200, 6500, 6600, 6800,    7200, 7300, 7600, 7800, 7900, 7950    8400, 8500, 8600, 8800    9600, 9800, GTX 260, GTX 280      Intel? Extreme Graphics    GMA 950, GMA X3000, GMA X3100        ATI Radeon? series    9500, 9600, 9800    X300, X600, X700, X800, X850    X1300, X1600, X1800, X1900, X1950    2400, 2600, 2900    3450, 3650, 3850, 3870,    4850   So basically any AGP card with those chipsets and at least 128 Mb   of Vram should work. Replacing it is as easy as taking out the old video card and literally popping the other one in. Very simple process. Don't be afraid.    This card should do the trick. Inexpensive from a good brand.    http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...|`|GEY9or2Raa	Well he needs to understand that two replace a graphics card, he needs to know a few things.  He needs to know:    1.  What interface his motherboard supports.  2.  What kind of power does he have to share.    Since I have taken the liberty of doing research on your computer, I know that he has an available AGP slot in his computer.  So he needs to buy an AGP graphics card.  AGP is old technology so it may be hard to find a card.    Looking at them I would recommend a 3850.  It will come with a power adapter so it will work with your power supply.  There are a few on newegg, and others elsewhere.

bVZ7uZjJaa	I'm not sure how it vanished, but I think this will bring it back.    1) Log into your Facebook account  2) Go to your profile page  3) In the publisher bar (the Box at the top of your Wall) you should see tabs like Wall, Info, Photos - at the end of this are two symbols one is >> the other is +  4) Select the >> first - do you see Boxes in here?  If so, it means you have the boxes tab enabled, it's just hidden behind the >> symbol - you can Drag the boxes tab closer to Wall if you want it to be displayed all the time.  But note you can only have 6 tabs displayed at any one time.  5) If it is not behind the >> symbol, select the + symbol - Boxes should be here as a tab to add.  Repeat step 4 to move the tab to the location you want it.    Hope that helps.

hx5myrabaa	c++ looks cooler than VB. But seriously, it depends on what you want to do. If you want to make a quick program with a GUI, then use VB. If you want a simple and fast program, then use c++. Although, you may also want to consider visual c.|`|DDybzauSaa	Very little, the advantages you get are limited when you realize that when you programme something in vb, it is completely system dependent and the basic things that go along with high level languages. One advantage you do get is a little bit of simplicity, but no where near that which its ancestor BASIC had. I would advise you avoid the use of Visual Basic, simply because it cannot be called Visual BASIC. If it could still rightly be called BASIC, then it would have a huge advantage in simplicity over C, but that has gone when they made the jump to Windows.|`|cfIw68YAaa	VB is garbage collected.  That is a huge advantage and outweighs any other concern.  There are better languages than VB though, like C ...

If there is a Wifi connection available and it just will not connect to it you could try re-submitting the service books to blackberry or pulling your battery out, reinserting it and letting the Blackberry reboot it's operating system.
