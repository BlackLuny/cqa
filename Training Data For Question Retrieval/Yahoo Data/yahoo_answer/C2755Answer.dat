82f3f488591403929b7c3b399a4a77eeaa	Same thing happened to my mixed lab, Hobo.  He was about 14 years old.  I didn't even know he was blind until he started walking into my living room tables, instead of around them.  It is a shock, I know.  You keep feeling like "how did I not know?", or at least I did.  It was going to be about $1500 - to $2,000 to remove one cataract -- this was about 8 years ago.  dont know if it would be less expensive or more now.  We never had it done, as Hobo's health declined pretty quickly after that and I had to put him to sleep.  I still feel so guilty but he nuzzled me at the last minute, as if to say, it's okay.  good luck.|`|AA11601170	shi1t man YOU HAVE TO GO TO THE VET that requiers surgery inmediatly|`|AA10853193	OMG!

The lenses can be replaced in a fairly routine surgery, although I'm not sure how often it's done on dogs.|`|2a58fb2629fa63050591f9e51d407de1aa	The procedure is to go to your vet because you can't do anything about it unfortunately. From what i heard, they scratch away the cataract under anesthesia.|`|b3af48a7956596e9b98e122a5e51b828aa	Cataracts are a natural part of the aging process. Working for a vet, we just let the process go. It is going to be more traumatic to your pet & your wallet to put her through any type of surgery. Cataracts are like looking through a very foggy car windshield. She has basically been blind for a while other than she can see shadows & movement. She will adapt to the loss of this sense, remember, they have better smell & hearing than us. Don't move your furniture around and talk more as you two walk around together so she follows your voice.  If this is a large dog, she's basically the age of your grandma, you have to think about what a surgery like this would do to her. There are specialist in this area though, If you are going to do it, make sure you go to them & not just a local vet.|`|0a87f7e913d9a586808355e706414d1eaa	There is a surgery my sister-in-law had a dog with diabetes & he went blind,it is very costly & it work i am not just saying this it's  Gods  hoanest truth i would never lie about something like this i have dogs that i love very much they are my children,just ask your vet.Your little girl is blessed to have a mommy like U that loves her so. I will ask my sister-in-law the name so i will try to let u know. i'm sorry i can't tell u the name right now .God Bless U Both.

But they are sweet dogs & fiersly protective of you.  Bichon's look similar to a poodle. They have curly, fluffy white hair, lots of maintenance. I have never really liked this breed of dog. They come in to our office & they just aren't overly friendly. They do tend to have some skin problems too.  Bichons tend to be just a little bit bigger than the cairn's.|`|230de8c8ef5f153f11aae5f1a15af8d6aa	You mean the two ENTIRELY different BREEDS?? Entirely different GROUPS???

20dbd65260ed0cb839dde755c8431626aa	As a vet tech, I generally prefer Papillons because they tend to be less aggressive/fearful than chihuahuas.  I rarely get bitten by a papillon, but chihuahuas have that "Napoleon Complex" pretty often.  And chihuahuas are a lot louder at the hospital, too. Puppy Papillons have a cute quirk that I am building a theory about...A happy and healthy Papillon has ears that stand up straight.  Often, it seems that depressed or sick Papillons have ears that droop. It sure makes it easy to tell which one feels crummy.  Don't know if its a fact, but its something I've noticed. We see a lot of puppies at my practice, and generally have at least 1 or 2 Papillon pups each week in the hospital for repsiratory infections from the crappy puppy mill they come from. Make sure if you're thinking about buying a puppy that you get it from a reputable breeder instead of a pet store. Or...even better...rescue one!|`|AA10748080	we have a papillion and she is the cutest little dog that you'll ever meet. she'll be 8 in a month though she doesn't bite, loves to play and seems to always have a happy disposition. i would highly recommend a papillion! she's also really snuggly too. ^_^|`|f18ddaba397f304d2218b6a0ad642260aa	Papillion they are known to have less temper problems...some chihuahuas have bad tempers|`|AA12262062	I have never had a papillion, but they are beautiful dogs!!

They are also good companions to the elders and young children. They also help w/ depression in people.

AA11226206	Depends on if you have a boy or a girl. Girls take a little longer to heal. A good rule is not to let your bunny out to play from his/her cage for about two weeks. I know that is a long time but torn stitches aren't good. The boy will likely swell after it is done. But don't worry unless it looks that way for more than 48 hours. You should definately ask for Metacam, a pain reliever, from the vet.|`|AA10088970	Alot of vets do recommend getting them fixed. I think that it is a great idea. It is a pretty siple procedure from what I have heard and read. I think that the only real concern would be maybe picking up an infection which the vet will probably give you antibiotics anyways.|`|b3af48a7956596e9b98e122a5e51b828aa	We at my office would NEVER put a bunny under for that. They are way to suseptable. It's very dangerous. And my Dr. is awesome, other vets send their problem surgeries to him.
AA11961314	They're not all cute, lol. Trust me, I work at a vet, and they're not. They're man's best friend because they're so loyal, and they can also sense your emotions because of your mannerisms and such, and they then often act accordingly. They also aren't going to dis you, or yell at you for not cleaning your room, or being late.|`|AA10219752	Loyalty, unconditional love, companionship and laughs.|`|AA11232899	Because dogs are cool!

For a vet though, at 21 days from conception, there is a small window that the vet can palpate the abdomen & feel if there are any puppies. At 45 days from conception, your vet can take an xray & do a spine count to see how many puppies are in there & if they look to big to come out.

mK2EqhPVaa	Well, if I give Merlyn half the chance he's running after the neighbours cows trying to get the patties while they are still warm, I had to buy covered litter boxes to stop him from eating the cat kaka, the donkey kicking him hasn't deterred him from going into the pen to eat his stool and even getting chased by three horses hasn't stopped his desire to get at the poop. Sadly, it would seem that eating feces is normal for our canine companions. Although it sounds as though it might be worse for you that others. The best I can suggest is trying to keep him from it and deworming him regularly.|`|Kw2tkAUjaa	feed her|`|dfJRWvALaa	my vet said that my dog was lacking some type of nutrion, and that he ate so much that when he potted the nutriants were still in the feces. there is a medication that the vet can give him that will make the feses disgusting and they wont eat it.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	Actually, it's very common in dogs; however, most of them outgrow it once they're no longer puppies.  It's not good for them, obviously, so you need to put the litter box up high where she can't reach it, put the trash where she can't get to it, and tell her no firmly and pull her back from other dogs' feces when walking her.|`|23a9a397ca0d0ff6f0dae262ba570eecaa	You need to do two things-one,put the trash and soiled items away so the dog cannot get to them,secondly,redirect your dog from other dogs feces with a toy or a treat as soon as she tries to go for it. using the "leave it" command. Treat and praise as soon as she listens to you. If you dog is eating her own feces,try adding pineapple to her food. This will make the poo unappetizing to her.Good luck

I prefer real fences for many reasons.  A solid fence will prevent people from teasing the dog and making him bark at everyone who goes by.  I installed my own six-foot stockade fence with panels I bought at Home Depot.  Digging the post holes is the hardest part. It's best to use metal fence posts and concrete - they'll last forever!    An invisible fence requires a lot of training time on your part - if you don't do it right, the dog will learn to run right through the shock and keep going. Then he can't come home again. The dog IS getting an electric shock, no matter what those companies say. A real fence is better for several reasons. There is nothing to prevent a stray dog from coming on to your property and attacking your dogs. Also, in many states there is an "attractive nuisance" law - suppose your dogs are loose in your yard and being good. But some little kid seems them and comes into your yard to pet them. If they knock the child down and injure him or bite him - YOU could be liable.     Corgis are pretty smart and easy to train. Read some great books on training. (Try not to pick books randomly - there are a lot of bad books out there also!)

Denn auch wenn es sich um einen Menschen handelt, statt einem Igel, versucht man natürlich alles andere, als voll in den Gegenverkehr zu lenken...<br>  <br>  Das Gesetz ist unn?tig, denn jeder normale Fahrer wird einen Menschen mehr zu schützen versuchen, als ein Tier, aber jeder normale Fahrer wird auch alles m?gliche versuchen ein Tier zu schützen. <br>  <br>  Das Gesetz soll bewirken, dass durch die Verschonung von Tieren keine Menschen gef?hrdet werden.<br>  Aber das geht eben so nicht!

Und zwar besagt diese, wenn für den Autofahrer Gefahr für das eigne Leben und die Unversehrtheit besteht so  muss er nicht mit Bleifu? ein Tier überfahren.<br>  Das bedeutet, das ab einer bestimmten Gr??e n?mlich ab gro?rassigen Hunden wie Sch?ferhund eine Bremsung gerechtfertigt ist, und nicht der Bremser schuldig bzw alleinschuldig ist. Ein Wildschwein, ein Reh usw. muss man nicht totfahren.

I used to have hamsters years ago that did exactly the same thing and I'm happy to say they never hurt themselves doing it but if you are worried about her getting hurt maybe you should change her to a tank cage when she gets older.|`|TJDZdqv3aa	Hamsters are a rodent, and rodents jump.

S9a5pofuaa	To be honest this is not uncommon for starlings, I am a wildlife rehabber and our group used to care for starlings, they are one of those birds that can be hard to raise. They perk up and before you know it they die. Chances are it was nothing you did, if you contacted a rehabber and they instructed you on how to feed and care for it then this bird had a problem before you found it. I sounds a bit like he was caught by a cat prior to you finding it. If it was, the bacteria in a cat's saliva can kill a bird weather there is an injury or not. They need antibiotics withing the first 12 hours of the attack to counter act the bacteria. If they don't receive the antibiotics they become sick very quickly and die shortly after showing signs of illness. Like I said chances are you did nothing wrong Starlings are a hard bird to raise. I am sorry that you had to go through this. I know how hard it is.|`|Jav4nWgLaa	I think the worms have to be mashed up|`|bcf20fa86dacdb1f6a2cf4c5f0b6bdb0aa	I Think the bird saw 1 of you 3 arseholes and thought it was a bowling ball lol|`|8b7f8e496ede0dcde287f7fa3adf10c8aa	was it cold where he was that may have been it...|`|d3ef71ddd8b3e8978beeaf8997e49478aa	I am so sorry that happened to you and I think Jen E has the best answer out here.  :-(|`|wp7SDly6aa	I think you got an excellent answer from the bird rehabber here.

L7vKeyvWaa	your female is still considered a "puppy" age.....once she reaches 1 1/2 years she should calm down a little.  The rough housing is normal in a "pack" mentality.  what you need to do is make your dogs believe you are the "alpha dog" and they will listen when you tell them to calm down.  Teaching the word "settle" works very well and is easy to understand.  be sure to show gratitude when they do settle down and don't show attention when they are rough housing, seperate the two into seperate rooms (like a time out) and give a gentle scolding.....they will learn the lines of your acceptance for playing and will be compliant as long as you are consistent.  this won't turn around overnight but she be better w/i a few weeks.  good luck!|`|1175919c792798f7ad5d36021009a35eaa	Actually they are still young. This will subside in time as they get older, not to worry. But let me warn you that the beagle will be somewhat playful for a few years to come yet. Its just their nature. My sister has one and she didn't out grow her playfulness until she was about 4 yrs. old. I'm learning myself about how playful they can be. I have a saddle-back beagle, a mini. shcnauzer and a snoodle. They range in age of 1yr. to 5yr. and the oldest is the schnauzer and the youngest is the beagle and those two are constantly playing rough with one another. The snoodle is mostly mild mannered and my shadow. I had my male schnauzer neutered and that slowed him down some, but didn't take the playfulness out of him. But I blame that on the beagle cause she's so young and won't leave him alone. Patience my dear, enjoy them in their playful years, they are so cute at that stage.|`|AA11094269	Let them get on with it -it's what dogs do. Both my dogs, (a Shorthair pointer who's 3 and a Wirehair Pointer who's 1 1/2) do this and both of them usually end up with scratches and scabs as a result of their throwing each other round the house.<br>  <br>  Just make sure to keep an eye on them so it doesn't escalate to the point that it turns into a real fight. As long as they are both happy in their position in their pack and importantly, they both see either you or your husband as a definite Alpha, there shouldn't be any real problems between them.|`|IAE7surwaa	Usually when dogs are not neutered.

I don't like dogs wrestling all the time, I don't let our dogs wrestle and play like that. I am worried that one day someone ends up hurt or someone ends up mad and they get serious. If you don't like it, then don't allow it. You can't allow it sometimes and not others, It's one or the other.. Allowed or not allowed. <br>  <br>  Females tend to be hmmm... trouble makes sometimes :) Especially when it comes to playing with the boys, like to get them going and tease. It's not abnormal, but can be annoying!|`|8584e0329fb17c662606d5a6a8650ee2aa	Dogs love to play.  It's in their nature.  Get them lots of exercise and it might reduce the amount of play but it won't eliminate it.  Is there a dog park near you or another safe place you can take them to play?  Take them there and let them do it.  This a natural thing for them to do.<br>  <br>  If no one is getting hurt then the play isn't too rough from their perspective.  They are just having fun and doing what dogs do.

DZ7FIxqqaa	Size and breed make a lot of difference.<br>  We raise Pekingese and size at birth is about across your palm. Like any baby,  they will fall asleep on the bottle as their tummy gets warm milk. Since they do fall asleep and get very little initially, it's best to get a Kitchen Scale that measures tiny weight changes 1/8 oz 1/4 oz etc. Write down the before feeding weight, and the after feeding weight, that way you know for sure what the pet has taken in.<br>  A loss overnight need not be serious since they do use the bathroom, and sometimes on you during feeding.<br>  We feed our little ones two or three times a night and 4-6 times a day. The scale is important, it has saved lives and tells us if feeding is needed when the pup remains with it's Mom.<br>  our pups are registered and we get a good reasonable price for them. but the love of the puppies is the best reason for raising them.<br>  We currently have 11 growing up in our kennel, and two more Moms expecting.

M3jRtq2Aaa	Wow! that must have been a big Yorkie to loose 7 lbs!  <br>  I'm sorry your dog is ill.  DM causes weight loss because the body cannot digest the sugar or carbohydrates effectively or use it effectively in the cells.  So instead of the body using the food it eats, it must use fat or muscle tissue it has stored to survive.  The sugar then is discarded through the urine or lays in the bloodstream unused which causes high blood sugar.<br>  <br>  Has your vet put her on meds? If so her body will now be able to use the food she eats more effectively, and she will again be able to gain some weight.  You will have to watch her for signs of low blood sugar now, if she is on insulin.  Did the vet explain that to you? If her blood sugar drops too low from injected insulin, she will die. Feed her often to keep her blood sugar up.|`|f9fb186e1c82bf7349b1e14dcbb1bcc4aa	You need to be strict about what you feed your dog. Foods high in fiber and protein, with restricted fats and carbohydrates are best. Feed your dog at the same times every day as what they eat, and when they eat it, will effect its sugar/insulin levels. <br>  <br>  One-third of the total daily amount of food should be given 1/2 hour prior to the injection. The remaining amount of food should be given 8-10 hours later. If your dog likes a snack before bedtime take it out of the 2/3rds amount.<br>  <br>  Set up an exercise program and stick to it. If you decide to walk your dog, or play catch for 20 minutes every day, you need to be consistent. Exercise will effect the "sugar" levels in the dogs blood stream -- and you don't want that level "up" one day and "down" the next. The "up and down" isn't good for the dog. If your dog is overweight, you'll have to put it on a diet to loose weight slowly.|`|AA11722366	hi

My rotty is a big ol' baby and she hates rain -- but she'll go outside if she has to go. Because she knows her choices are: hold it, or go potty outside!|`|a61dba48a983fa5c3d20f3d5a3f752deaa	Dont make her go in the house... just make her go outside, or just leave her be and she will go when it stops raining. One of my dogs also doesnt like to go out when it rains but if she has to go bad enough she will run out quick and go.. otherwise she just tries to outwait the rain. It is NOT advisable or at all a good idea to encourage your dog to go in the house its impossible to teach the distinction "you can go inside when its raining but not when its nice out" you dog will just start going in the house any time. So either kick her outside despite her dislike of rain or leave her be until the rain stops.<br>  <br>  Put it this way..If your kid had to walk to school but refused to go to school when it was raining wouldnt you just make them anyway??

3aa5b4d40e7e17cf746f4ee0e3ba2738aa	Well, once you graduate from medical school, you don't have to do any surgeries.  You can work in research or other fields of vet medicine that don't require surgeries.    You need to understand the becoming a veterinarian requires two college degrees generally.  You will first need to graduate college with the B.S. degree in a life science or pre-vet med.  And then go to medical school.  Just to get a undergraduate degree requires LOTS and LOTS of opening up animal bodies and studying their parts.  This is called dissection and you do a bunch of it in college.      In order to graduate vet medical school you will have to perform surgeries on live animals.      I have been seeing this question a lot lately and I have to wonder how can you want to be a doctor if you can't stand the sight of internal organs and blood.  How will you know how to help an animal if you have no idea what is going on inside their bodies and where their organs are?     Also remember there are over 3000 applicants for every spot in vet med school.  You better do great in math and science.|`|AA11853631	They have to do most surgeries, like spay/neuters, c-sections, surgeriers for bowel obstructions, removal of tumors, fixing luxating patellas, surgery for hip displaysia. Specialized surgeries like heart operations may have to be done by a specialized vet. My vet does just about every kind of surgery there is.|`|AA10522515	They would have to be able to identify and fix things that are wrong with the animal,i would imagine like any other surgeon.|`|AA11709234	Vets need to do many kinds of surgery.  Most, like a spay, involves opening the abdomen.  Exploratory surgeries are common and involve opening the abdomen and looking all over inside for the problem.  There can be bone surgery,basic stitches,eye surgery....many different kinds.  If you cannot stand things like that, you do not want to be a vet.  There are other things like lancing abcesses and seeing streams of pus, and extracting maggots from dogs and cats bodies.  It is not a glamerous job!!!!!  Try seeing if you can watch surgery at a vet hospital.  If you just cannot handle it, save the money you would spend at vet school!!!|`|1fea345288f86d30c7744db62db71e27aa	My first guess is proper grammar of the English language.     There are specialists in the field of veterinary medicine just as there are in human medicine, neurosurgeons, heart surgeons, etc., Some vets only perform surgery for spay and neuters. Others do more complicated surgeries.   Decide what kind of veterinary medicine you want to go into, there's equine vets, exotic vets, livestock vets and so on. Basic veterinary training will require some knowledge in all these areas.  Research it on-line to find out if this is only a whim or you have the dedication to pursue a veterinary degree.|`|AA10233318	in the vet hospital I work at vets perform pretty routine surgeries such as spay, castrations, dental cleanings and declaws. Other surgeries are lumpectomies, tumor removals, exploratories where they open up and search for any abnormalaties, unblock intestines when dogs swallow foreign objects etc. I saw the other day one of our vets remove an enormous tumor from a dog's belly, it was almost the size of a watermelon.I do admit I feel weak sometimes seeing all the blood, but I guess you kind of get used to it with time.|`|20497851ad49f624e78bced03323c357aa	Well, this is an question that has way too many answers to list.|`|AA12362595	Yes they do have to open the animals body, they can really do anything that a doctor can do but to an animal|`|AA12173069	All types.

Heart surgery and more complicated surgeries are done by specialists that requires more schooling. If you want to be a vet, you have to have REALLY good grades and Vet school is MUCH harder to get  into than human medical school.|`|AA11706300	"Veterinary surgery is surgery performed on animals by veterinarians. Some of the most common surgeries performed in general veterinary practices are spays and neuters.    In the United States, veterinary surgery is one of 20 veterinary specialties recognized by the American Veterinary Medical Association.[1] Those wishing to become board-certified must preform a large number of large animal and small animal procedures in such categories as abdominal surgery, surgical treatment of angular limb deformities, arthroscopic surgery, surgery of the foot, fracture fixation, ophthalmic surgery, urogential surgery, and upper respiratory surgery."    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterinary_...|`|b3af48a7956596e9b98e122a5e51b828aa	A vet will literally have to do everything. In a basic day, we see many abcesses. Those are wounds that have become infected & are now making the animal very ill. If you have a pet that presents with tumors, no matter where they are (heart included), you will need to biopsy and/or possibly remove. There's also cysts that can be anywhere. You may even have to remove a dog's anal glands because they are constantly infected. As a vet you will have to know every inch of the animals body whether your ever going to work on it or not. And you'll never know what you'll need because there's accidents rushed into the office at least once a week. The schooling to become a vet is basically the same as a doctor except that after getting the degree, then you have to go to veterinary school to learn all the specifics.

IiFBXCViaa	Actually Advantage tends to work better for ferrets and I prefer it because it is not absorbed systemically as the revolution is. Ask your veterinarian for advantage feline under 9 pounds. Have the vet use a syringe to divide the dose in half, use that half on one ferret. part the hair between the shoulder baldes and apply it directly to the skin. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edited to add:<br>  Buying advantage from ebay is against the law so be careful with that. That is the reason that 1800petmeds got sued and almost lost their business. They were illegally selling medications that were not approved for sale in the U.S., had the same name and label as the u.s. products but were only approved for U.K. and Austrailia.  Avoid internet sites, take your ferrets to the vet, at least that way you can get their vaccines while you are there.|`|5c18461135fdae3004c86b269dd8063faa	I talked to my vet when I had this problem and he suggested using advantage (the small kitten size-only half of the tube per ferret).

One of my puppy buyers reports that he has a shinier coat and smaller stools.  I *have* heard of the odd dog getting intestinal blockage from the bones.    I have fed other raw diets in the past, healthy dogs, no problems.  I occasionally give my dogs chicken or turkey necks as a treat, but I can't bring myself to give them the long bones like wings.

There is a window on that day that the abdomen is at it's thinnest before bulking up for the pregnancy, but your vet will be able to feel the abdomen & tell if there are puppies in there. At 45 days or later, your vet can take an xray called a pup count. This will show the spines of the puppies, the vet will tell you how many & if they are too big or not.  If you don't know the day or approx day, then if you wait till you start seeing her abdomen get larger & her teets swollen, that's a good time to take her in for an xray.

AA10214397	I work as a purchasing agent for a retail chain that sells pet supplies.  Some dogs just seem to thrive better on one food more than another.  One food might make one dog sick but another dog might only be able to stomach that same food.  Dogs are like people.  They have preferences and food intolerances too.  But unless she refuses to eat a certain food, no dog food is unhealthy for her.    Pro Plan is an excellent food and if she's happy and healthy, there is no reason to change.  If ProPlan stops working for her, there are tons of other dog foods to try (Eukanuba, Science Diet, Purina One are just a few examples of a comparable food to Pro Plan).  I would suggest that if she is a large breed dog, you feed her large breed formulas.  If she's a small breed, make sure to feed her smaller kibble.  And when she gets to be over 7 years old, you start feeding her senior formulas.    If you decide to switch dog foods, don't forget to make the change gradually.  A quick switch often makes dogs sick to their stomach.|`|16649a74e7372b979fd2de2a1d3607bdaa	Canidae  Natural Balance  Chicken Soup for the Dog Lovers Soul    The general rule is that if you can buy it in a grocery store, it's a definate no.

ur5wDhkMaa	Just run it a day, maybe even only 12 hours. It's still cycled, but no filter means no circulation. Cycle means circle, so it get it ticking over.    I've got fry tanks that are full of cycled water, but switched off. I turn them on the day before they are going to be used and I've never had any problems.|`|JK2RvliYaa	that sux , it happened to my cousins cilchlids a couple years back. I think you should start the tank anew.|`|lg2RfcrQaa	No guessing what you're having to eat tonight then!|`|XOycoCiEaa	throw out dead fish. Buy new fish. To prevent fish from dying from a power outage add some decholrinated warm water to tank every hour.    how are you online?|`|wCcioHqVaa	Make sure u clean out the take real good and fill it up with fresh water. let it sit for a full day before getting new fish|`|IxP2IMbcaa	Sorry about your fishies! Other than that I am of no help.|`|snUDfcfgaa	Aw.  I'm truly sorry for your lots.  Glad to hear your power is back on though.      Edit: Sorry, ????3.  I misread your question the first time.  I'm no help either, but I hope things get back on for you soon.|`|lXE75yQjaa	Oh, I'm sorry..what a bummer. I think just removing them, and then checking your Ph, etc. is fine..if it's all good, it would be just fine for new ones.   |`|OsVswissaa	Your cycle is gone now, it can't live without fish or another ammonia source to feed it.  Since you've lost your cycle and there have been dead fish in there, you might as well empty the tank and start over just to be safe.
ur5wDhkMaa	To small for Koi, think more along the lines of 28X16 feet. You can stagger the depth, but part of it should be at least 4 foot deep if they are to survive winter outdoors. A shallow area would be not less than 2 feet, but predators are going to have an easy meal if your fish are caught there.    Everything to do with Koi should be done large scale, they are large fish and babies grow. A two foot fish will find it hard to hide in an 7 foot pond.|`|h4wNRqf9aa	depends where you live.. if lakes and ponds dont freeze over in the winter where you live the pond could only be about 18" deep (though im sure a heron or raccoon would pick them off if it is that shallow, and 3 feet is recomended anyways)    my koi pond is about 13'x9'x4', i live in chicago so winters are damn cold, it's a little small but im only planning on housing one koi, the rest will be goldfish    7x4 is pretty minimal, and below ideal    if you could make it like 7x7 that'd be much better, but you still shouldn't *FILL* it with koi    babys grow, and fast we had a 4" koi in march and ended up with a 9" bruiser in october
Vh5DrXvOaa	My cat is declawed...He "sharpens" his claws too. I think its just an instinctive thing that they do. Each person has their own reasons for declawing their cat..I think its a personal choice that should be respected...|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Their claws are actually part of the bone structure in their paws.  Their claws are very similar to the tips of our digits, so claw removal is like an amputation.  Stretching their "digits" is just a natural instinct and would be similar to us wiggling our fingers even though part of the fingers has been removed.  It's also possible that, like many human amputees, they may get phantom itches, pains, etc. from that area.|`|IuYekkPVaa	Many people mistakenly think that cats scratch just to sharpen their claws.  Scratching is an instinctive and necessary behaviour for cats.  So even when their claws have been removed, they still go through the motions for several reasons.    They stretch the muscles in their legs, backs, shoulders and paws by digging their claws into a surface and pulling back against their own clawhold.  This is the only way a cat can exercise, stretch and tone the muscles of its back and shoulders.     They've also got scent glands on their paws, so when they scratch somewhere it's a way of marking territory and letting other cats know their size by how high they can reach.|`|V4PlWZK7aa	They still think they have their claws. they don't know that they're gone.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	Because they remember when had their claws of course. Declawing is barbaric, it stops cats from doing things that are natural to them.|`|DXzI2jrEaa	Cats have scent glands on the underside of their paws that release small amounts of their scent. They paw objects and even people to release the scent to mark their territory or, in other words, what they consider to be theirs exclusively. Cats will do this regardless of whether or not they have claws.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Just because you had their claws inhumanely ripped out doesn't mean the cat knows that! Part of the very essence of a cat is their claws so they will still behave as though they have them. Shame on people that declaw! And double shame on vets that do the procedure!|`|xNkmK0SHaa	the "kneading" a cat does on a person or other pet and the "clawing" they do on furniture, doorways, etc. is actually not a method of sharpening their claws.  There are small glands between the toes and the kitty is doing territorial marking.|`|vSHkZWUoaa	they are wierd
JGq9rKBOaa	Generally mice only live about 1.5 to 2 years, even if you take very good care of them. I've had mice that live longer, but even 3 years is a lot to expect. Taking good care of them can help, of course, but most mice in pet stores are so carelessly bred that they will not live a terribly long time. Many of them develop health problems at some point.     So to answer your question, there isn't really a direct way to translate mice years into human years. I'd consider a mouse "getting up there" at about 1.5 years. One year is pretty solidly into adulthood.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Not entirely sure,but if an average Mouses life span is 2-3yrs,then at 1yrs of age,s/he will be about 25-35yrs old,in Human lifespan.    Hope that has been of some use! xxx|`|1YYmQI5Naa	I'd say about 20 or 30. :]
5i8lDbXfaa	If you go to a beach there are possibilities of Beach riding where you're guided along the beach on rent horses.  Check around for riding stables maybe.        I found this one kind close to Orlando.    http://www.realadventures.com/vacations/...
hIyjdXr9aa	If you give the baby fish a place to hide, the majority of them will survive.  I bought a mixture of fake and live plants and stuffed the corners of my tank with them.  When the mother gave birth, the babies hid in the plants.  The bigger fish couldn't swim into the tightly packed plants, and were not able to eat the babies.  Weeks later, when the babies were large enough to not be eaten by their parents, they started swimming in the main water of the tank.      I have done this many times now, and have also tried the "breeding box separator".  I find that the breeding box is too small for the female to get comfortable in and that some females get very stressed inside it.  One female livebearing fish, a platy I had, even refused to give birth in there and delayed the labor by a day or two because she was so stressed inside that small space.    I came to the conclusion that it is not necessary to use a breeding separator as long as you have plenty of hiding spaces in your aquarium and no really large aggressive fish that specifically hunt down fry.  (Gouramis hunt down and eat fry, in my experience.  You only have neon tetras and other guppies, which won't specifically hunt down and eat the fry.  They will be fine if you just have plants.)  I also would like to point out that since female guppies give birth every month and you have two of them, your expected amount of new babies is fifty to sixty babies every month.  If every single baby survives, you'll be overstocked.  And then the babies will start reproducing.  So it's really in your best interest to use the method I describe, which is to simply provide hiding spaces.  The fastest babies (about half of them) will survive to adult hood.      Oh, by the way, I also experimented with raising the fry in a separate tank and with raising the fry in the main tank with plants to hide in.  The fry grow faster and bigger in the main tank, with its established yummy algae and microscopic tiny yummy bacteria animals, than being fed fry food in a smaller, not established tank.  They also love eating live plants and any little tiny animals that live off of the live plants.  It's like what would happen in a real pond  :)|`|AraBfesHaa	OMG dude, ur gonna get a hemmoroid over this.  Just leave them alone.  They will mate and probably have already.  But it's gonna take about 4 weeks before you have any fry.  Therre's nothing you can do to speed it up, you're just gonna have to wait.  This is the 3rd time you've asked about this.  What kind of answer are you looking for that we haven't already given you?  Leave the adults in the tank.  After the fry are born, put them in the breeder to protect them from getting eaten.  Simple as that.  You already have the breeder, so chill and wait for a month or so|`|7HhD7FIQaa	You can keep the babies in small food containers, or a "Baby Box" which is just a box you can fix to the side of your tank.|`|F8m1VaoYaa	dont put your guppie in breeding tank,it stresses them out   once fry have been born try to catch as many as you can put the fry in the breeding tank for about 4-6 weeks then they should be able  to be put in main tank without any fear of being eaten,thats what i have done a couple of times ,worked for me and the fry.|`|JKbvnwcDaa	A few might get eaten, but most will make it. I started out with a male and two females, now I have about 50. I left them in the regular tank, they hid for a few weeks but then they were out swimming around. The big ones might go after them still, but trust me, they are very quick.|`|WBVJJKz2aa	Sometimes the parents eat the baby fish so they should probably be removed but everything else should be fine.|`|rdp95817aa	yes wait untill they are grown up then put them back
dD08pRIwaa	The breeding trap is supposed to be used for an already pregnant guppy not when you're trying to get them pregnant. Almost every kind of fish that can will try to eat the newborn guppies. Once the female is close to having the babies put her in the breeding trap.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	they might most likely tiger barbs will eat them|`|AA11565869	tiger barbs will eat anything, but baby fish of any bred are a slam-dunk!|`|wnnudNp5aa	Most any fish will eat another fish if it fits into it's mouth. That's part of their diet in the wild! I'd recommend getting a book on breeding Guppies before you attempt it, so you'll know how to do it correctly.|`|kwnq8b2waa	yes, they will eat them.
ca9FLLhHaa	Don't use a normal plastic bottle, out gassing from the plastic could poison your fish.  My suggestion would be to ship it overnight. You'll need to get cooperation people at the address it is shipped from and the people at the destination address. Importantly, you'll need a suitable tank at the destination thats already got a well balanced environment that won't be a shock to the fish. This also ensures makes your fish don't sit on someones porch or in the post office for too long. DON'T USE UPS!!!, they treat packages like crash test dummies and packages have been known to be punctured with sharp objects (that would pop the bags). Find another shipping company that knows how to ship live animals. USPS Priority Mail takes longer, but if the time it is a safe for your species of fish, then USPS is good. Remember to consider total time from the moment you fish are in the bags, driven to the pick-up point, actual picked-up (which could add a day), the time they will sit before being picked up at the destination, then the time needed to transfer them into their new environment. Talk to you local pet store. If they deal in fish they've shipped them. They can provide you with advice and packing materials. They have heavy-duty bags that won't poison your fish and will hold enough water and air for the fish for the duration of the trip.|`|OsVswissaa	You'll have to seal the fish in a bag really well.  Check with the airline for their regulations.  If you can't take him with you on a commercial flight you could have him shipped via ups.|`|NoOM7eZnaa	A friend of mine brought over his 500gal aquarium from England two years ago. It had quite a few fish in it. Apparently, he had to get a passport for the fish (lol?) and the aquarium was put in the pet hold where people keep thier animals and powered by the plane so the filter would work. It's simple so if it were me I'd just ask the airline company about the process.|`|mrQKfR1faa	I thought about that a lot.. The only possible way i could think of is bring is the fish in a bag of water, Then when you get through security, ask them for a bottle of water or bag of water, put the fish in there and then your through.. The only thing I would think thats wrong with that is that the fish might and probably will die on the plane because of air pressure and elevation and the movements of the plane.|`|7rTljpcdaa	I shipped my arowana and flew along with him. You ask a fish courier or petshop that has am importation company. Petshops usually has someone who imports fish for them. Ask them who they use and ask those people to do it for you. Fill in the forms and they will ship it for you in a professional manner. However if your fish is a snakehead or something it will not be alowed, though.  Hope his helps.    P.S. reply to me what type of fish it is. It sounds like a really awsome fish if you want to ship it.
ZynsCbudaa	yeah really. i want to know the same thing, exept for I want to buy some.|`|H06PtiIAaa	i have my fish shipped with fedex, just a personal prefrence i guess.    dont feed the fish for 2 days prior to shipping so that way you reduce the waste in the bag, then double bag the fish, have plastic peanuts in the syrofoam box inside of a regular cardboard box,     depending on where you are going, heat or cold pack inside with the fish, but wrap it in newspaper.    Then i would bring it to be shipped.    i like fed ex because of the tracking number and they are on top of updates.|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	here is a tutorial of how to ship fish: http://www.ultimatebettas.com/index.php?...
TAMx7qzCaa	Hamsters dont live that long, but if it is sick & drinking lots of water thats a good thing! What u could do to boost ur furry friends immune system is go to a local pet store like Petco, Petsmart, TSC, etc.  & get vitamin & minerals that are water soluble. It will be in a lil bottle & all u do is put a few drops in his/her water.  Another thing is that when animals like rabbits & hamsters are sick there gums will be a very pail pink or almost white.|`|AA12323302	Sounds like she may be sick and I'm sorry to say but there's not much you can do for a sick hamster.  They have a really short life span (1-2 years) and sometimes they start acting strangely right before they're about to die.  I'm sorry though, hopefully I'm wrong and she'll get better on her own but all you can really do is what you've been doing, making sure she has clean water, new food and her cage is cleaned.  Good luck!
aP4bkYOCaa	Ferrets from Petco come from Marshall Farms. Marshall Farms neuters and spays all ferrets before they leave for the pet store, so yes, they are already altered.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Yes.  Marshall's ferrets are the most commonly found petstore ferrets, and they are spayed/descented as early as 4 weeks old, so they can be shipped out at a young age.  The second most common, Path Valley Farm ferrets are also early alter and descented, sometime around 6 or so weeks.
gJE0ujbzaa	Pros of living out-    Horses are built to live outside.  In the wild, they would normally walk fifteen or twenty miles a day, and their circulatory system and digestive tract have evolved so it is important to them to have quite a lot of walking.       Living outside, provided the field is big enough and not a tiny paddock or something, your horse will keep a certain level of fitness simply from walking around the field.        Living out, your horses will never develop stable vices such as stall walking, weaving or cribbing(caused when a horse is taken out of his natural environment, is not getting enough exercise, and not enough hours of eating time, and may be getting too much concentrated feed and not enough hay).        If your horse already has stable vices, they will usually be less when they are outside. Weaving and stall walking usually stops either completely or to where it's not very noticeable.  Cribbing will usually slow down, but some horses are so addicted they would rather crib than eat.  Usually, but not always, you will notice the horses crib less outside.      Colics are less likely, as the horse will be doing more walking and moving around, reducing the likelyhood of impaction colic.      Living out is usually less expensive, as no bedding is needed, nor daily stall cleaning(unless they are in a very small paddock, which really doesn't count as "living out" as far as I'm concerned).  And if they are on grass, feed bills will be much less(sometimes none at all if they have enough grass).      The cons of living out are, your horse will be dirtier from rolling in dust and mud(that's pro too though, they LOVE this, and can scratch their itches any time they need to). and if your horse is difficult to catch, that can be an issue if you are riding him regularly.        Pros of keeping him in a stall-    He will stay cleaner since he is not rolling in the mud and dirt in the field(a problem for the horse, they can't usually get in a really good roll in the stall, so they can get pretty itchy if they aren't getting a seriously good grooming every day).      He will be handy and you won't have catching issues when you want to ride.      Cons of keeping him in a stall-  Not enough exercise so hyper to ride, and won't keep any fitness level if not being consistantly worked    Likely to develop stall vices such as cribbing, weaving, and stall walking(basically, going insane from solitary confinement and lack of exercise)    More likely to colic due to lack of exercise and stress making impactions more likely.    More likely to misbehave when taken out due to excess energy.  More likely to need to be lunged before riding, which is stressful on legs making injuries more probable.      More likely to have breathing and skin problems, as well as hoof problems such as thrush, from being in a confined area and not getting enough fresh air.  Dust from bedding can cause irritated lungs and eyes.    More expensive to maintain, as they will need all feed provided, daily stall cleaning, and bedding.      My personal choice is to keep horses in a large field on grass if at all possible.  Sometimes if a horse is injured or sick, or elderly, they may need to be stalled. But most of the time, outside is much healthier for the horse.|`|p9reiXbnaa	Pros-  More natural so better for the digestive system,as the horse constantly trickle feeds,drastically reducing the risk of colic .  More socially forfulling than being stalled alone,  More settled happy horse as not bored or stressed if happy in a herd environment.  Fitter horse as constantly moving.  More time with your horse as no mucking out - no bedding to buy.    Cons-  Horse gets more muddy in the winter and its horrible scraping it off if not rugged !  Paying someone to feed her the supplement daily if you cant bring her in to do it.|`|LAXxaxAZaa	Pros of being inside:  Easy to catch  Won't fade in the sun  Easier to keep cool and warm  Less likely to get hurt  Less bugs  Easier to keep clean    Cons of being inside:  You either have to turn them out, or they won't get turned out  Even if they did get turned out, it wouldn't be for as long  Stall boredom  More expensive if you board  They can't socialize as much  No room to run|`|FWlSFpByaa	I think unless your horse is clipped that it belongs outside. they'd rather be running around playing instead of standing in a stall|`|XL62syrCaa	Horses are built to be outside. i know it is easier to have a horse in a stall (easier to keep clean, easier to catch, etc....) BUT your horse is happy outside. Most horses that have been outside their entire life become depressed when they are stuck in a stall. One they can't move around, two its dark, three they dont have free access to feed, four they cant reach their friends. It is just healthier to have your horse out in pasture and they can free feed (it also keeps vices like cribbing, weaving and pawing from showing up)|`|yqKTPVwqaa	It's different for every horse.  I've known horses who just pace when the are outside and they get really skinny and sick.  Those types of horses should spend most of their time inside with a few hours of turn out.  Also, horses are more likely to injure themselves when they are outside.  If your horse gallops like crazy or fights, she is going to get hurt outside.    Some horses get antsy from living inside.  If they don't get outside for exercise they can get wild when you try to ride them.  Also, if the stall isn't kept clean or isn't big, they will be uncomfortable.  You also need to check on horses kept inside more.  A horse outside will be able to take better care of himself.  It is also less expensive to keep your horse outside.    You should try looking for a place that keeps the horses inside, but has turn out.  As long as you ride your horse regularly and try to give her a little bit of time outside each day, she will probably be fine.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	i like my horse to be happy. i don't put my horses in the stall unless there is a good reason (such as, injury..etc) I have a small fenced in area with a run in shelter and my horses seem pretty happy. they can just go in and out of their stall as they please.     I'd say..just do whatever makes your horse happy! =) if she's happy, you're happy..    good luck!
d2Obe0aJaa	my pleasure horse like tacos, Lays Classic they can't be any other brand chips, peppermints, Icebreakers sour candy (the green ones), apple wafers which you can buy at the feed store also are his favorate|`|MaAtfDV7aa	My horse also really likes oranges and bananas in addition to the usual carrots and apples. :>|`|5QG9Zrjaaa	My TB loves pretzels; she is nutty for them.  try crackers and pretzels.

I like to keep my treats in plastic containers to keep out the mice and keep them fresh.  It's easy, and relatively cheap.|`|3VaF9gH0aa	Try them with any fruits and veg and see what they like. My horse loves turnips or swedes (they last long), orange peel but not the actually orange lol, and banana.

EyKJ737daa	Being a cat lover myself, please don't declaw them, if they accidentally get out, they not be able to defend themselves.  I would suggest getting them a scratching post and spraying some "catnip" on it to make it attractive to them and encourage them to scratch there rather than furniture.  You can also use household goods as some deterrents.  Citronella is fantastic.  While it smells pleasant to us, cats find the smell terrible and will stay away from it.  You can you citronella in on cotton balls/buds near potted plants to stop them from digging in dirt.  There are also jelly like crystals (usually green) that are also very pleasant smelling to the human nose that you can use in gardens called "keep off".  Placed strategically around the house on little saucers would work as a deterrents till your cats learn not to go in certain places and they will learn with time and patience.  Good luck with the move sweetie, hope all goes smoothly xx|`|OIRI5Ok7aa	Get them scratching posts.  Another thing to look into is a product called Softpaws that you can put on their claws so they can't actually hurt anything when they claw things.  You can find these at http://www.softpaws.com/ or at any pet store.  I trained mine not to by squirting him with water whenever he clawed something inappropriate.  Now, he just sticks to the scratching post.
H06PtiIAaa	at any petstore.    general yes but a saltwater tank is any aquarium.     Now you can drill it if you want for a sump filter or run overflows.  and lighting is depending on what type of saltwater tank you want to make.
h4wNRqf9aa	some sharks wont eat freshly killed or frozen foods, while these make great staple foods (as mentioned above) live food is generally required to initiate feeding response    ghost shrimp, live saltwater shrimps and crabs, or even small slow saltwater fish would make goods feeders, just be sure not to get anything too expensive of course|`|86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	What are you trying to feed it and how long have you had it? New fish do go on hunger strike when they're in a new environment until they've settled in.|`|H06PtiIAaa	feed it live food, it is bad, but it will trigger the shark to eat, then you can ween it off and use raw table shrimp.|`|e1js3Lhraa	Try swimming w/ it.|`|n20biayzaa	Try feeding it tiny pieces or strips of fresh, raw, pelled, shrimp or prawn. They love this. Once they smell it, they will quickly prowl on the bottom sucking in this food.    On the other hand, if you have just recently bought your shark, give it time to acclimate to your tank.  They usually won't eat for a couple of days or more, but will quickly respond to the food I mentioned earlier once the fasting is over.    Hope this helps.|`|ssHzAVlwaa	what type of food are you trying to feed you shark. Banded sharks tend to like squid. depending on the size of the shark, it can be really hard to feed them. in some cases they may even die from lack of food. in order to feed them you need to get a long tong like device and literally put the food in its face. eventually they will eat it. but you must watch carefully because if the fish is new to the tank, it might just be a bad fish.
cB5aBE0Eaa	Ok, a few of these answers are giving you false information. You should not follow the on inch per gallon rule, because it does not factor in things like if the fish school, how big they grow to, etc. For example, there is a fish called a clown loach. They can be purchased at about one inch. However, a responsible fish keeper would never follow the one inch per gallon rule and put a clown loach in a one gallon tank, because it grows quiet large and needs a school to be happy.    Ok, time to answer your question. With a 20 gallon, you have loads of options. A good idea would be to get to German Blue Rams, one male one female, so they get along. Check this page for more info:   http://liveaquaria.com/product/prod_disp...  Also, you  could get three male and six female guppies. Very colorful and fun to watch. But be aware guppies breed very easily, but if you don't want the babies the parents will eat most of them.   You could also go with a school of glowlight tetras, about 10 of them, or 10 cardinal tetras. Or five of each. Those are just a few of many options. I HOPE I HELPED!!! GOOD LUCK!!!|`|wCcioHqVaa	4-5   Get some neon tetras and some giant striped danios|`|gKRLXuXvaa	Inch of fish per gallon. So if the fish are 4 inches long then you put 5 in there. Remember they grow a little.|`|4HV0KknRaa	that person is right its supposed to be 1 inch of fish per gallon of water.  also if you absolutely love bettas like i do it is possible to have a betta in your community tank you just have to be very careful and it has to be a young betta. you have to be very cautious of what fish you put him with he will absolutely not be compatible with any fin nipping fish. i have my betta in with 4 platys 3 guppys and 5 cardinal tetras. one more word of caution establish your other fish before getting a betta that way he doesnt consider it HIS tank.      there are lots of delightful fish to put in guppys can be a colorful addition neon or cardinal tetras also are a lot of fun. i have a dwarf gourami hes got a lot of personality. and i just love platys.    barbs are neat looking fish but be careful as they nip fins so if you do get guppys they will likely pick on them.   also you can pick fish by level to make your tank more appealing. like hatchet fish hangout on the top and loaches go for the botom while neon tetras are mid to high level and guppys swim all over the place.   good luck with whatever you choose!!|`|UaLlyLAaaa	This is what i"m geting in mine you might like these and they all get along. =)    1 dwarf honey gourami (male) the males have longer stingy fins and the females don't, plus they aren't as colorful.    1 dwarf blue powder gourami    1 dwarf flame gourami (all dwarf gouramis get 2.5 in.)    3 female platies (the dorsal fins are rounded and the males have pointy ones) they breed like crazy if males too.    3 male guppies (they are colorful and have longer tails 1-2 in.)    5 cory cats (get 2.5 in. @ max.)    and some oto cats to clean algae (1-1.5 in.)|`|2mbELVTOaa	Well it depends on the kind of fish you put in the tank.I am sure you know you can't put a Beta in a tank with any other fish because they would kill each other.You can get some really pretty goldfish though.Not the ugly ones.The big pretty ones with the flowing tails!you  could probably put 3 to 4 of those in a 20 gallon tank.You could also by more exotic looking fish.As I said it depends on the fish.If you are planningh to put huge fish in the tank you probably couldn't put as much.I hope I helped and good luck with your fishes.
AA12349214	Your first answerer is right - without a full examination and x-ray then the horse cannot be given a clean bill of health - insurance would definitely not pay out if anything were to happen because a full examination had not taken place.  There are machines now that are mobile and you should look into this.  If not it is only fair on the horse to take it off the island and have a full x-ray done.  You cant second guess these types of thing - and as for riding the poor horse without first checking if it is capable of carriage of weight or if it will make the problem worse - it just shouldnt be done.  Sometimes you just have to do whats right for the animal not what suits the blasted human.|`|XL62syrCaa	You need to get a chiropractor out and have him check out her hing end all the way up to her hip and along her spine. If the vet wasn't able to check all of her hind end then it wasn't a full exam and she CAN'T be given a clean bill of health. It may be just lack of muscle, but it could be there is something wrong. And as the owner if he wants to work the horse "as hard as he wants" he needs to put the money in to make sure she isn't going to hurt herself worse.|`|Eg0XzwVUaa	my horse is Natural unsound this horse could possible just be the  same there's nothing i can do to my horse to make it sound but hes has Always been like that since his accident in the chart hes got a clean bill of health his bones have healed well and hes just as capable as any other horse but Always lame this could be the same with you horse|`|gJE0ujbzaa	Yes, she could have EPSM. It can cause muscle atrophy, weakness in the hind end, unexplained lameness, all kinds of things.    For more information, go to www.ruralheritage.com  Do a keyword search on EPSM. There is a load of information there from the vet who discovered the problem.  It's actually an easy fix if that's what it is.
AA10789032	Time and repetition are the key to stopping any dog from nipping or biting.  When your Chihuahua bites you must immediately react as if you are shocked.  Firmly say no and then ignore your dog.  Your Chi wants your attention more than anything so deny her that and you have control over her behavior. Do not yell or hit your dog! simply and firmly but strongly say "No" She will learn that this is unacceptable.  The main reason for a puppy to bite is teething, this can be a difficult time and you must have patience. Your Chihuahua needs something to chew on and not your fingers!

4HV0KknRaa	if you keep your water conditions absolutely perfect then yes those should all work.. if your just starting your tank you cant put all of them in at the same time cause your tank needs to cycle first. if you arent that great about water changes you should probably consider a few less fish|`|q5DTcOuaaa	Okay, those gouramis are going eat the guppies.|`|KEYgd73saa	The idea that an inch of fish equates to a gallon of water is flawed in so many ways I don't even know where to begin.  It is quite possibly the most pathetic excuse for a rule, guideline, or even suggestion as for how to stock a tank.  I think most will agree that anybody with even the most insubstantial knowledge of fish can find great problems with such a "rule"-- for example, 20 Neon Tetras in a 20 gallon tank is probably understocked (you could add a nice group of Cories, or something similar with no problem); however, a 15 inch Oscar in a 20 gallon tank is absolutely absurd (it wouldn't be able to turn around!), but by the "rule", it would be very conservative stocking.  The only way to stock a tank is with knowledge and logic!!!    Sorry for the rant-- it was a necessary evil.  As for the actual stocking, I'd suggest replacing the Dwarf Gouramis with something else.  At the moment, the Dwarves are extremely prone to iridovirus, which is uncurable and usually fatal.  There are similar Gourami species (Honey Gouramis, Thick Lipped Gouramis, Licorice Gouramis, Chocolate Gouramis, Sparkling Gouramis, etc.) that also stay quite small, are much healthier, and would be less likely to fight amongst themselves in a 20 gallon tank.    I'd also suggest you get male Platies, or you're going to have trouble with fry.  Unless your goal is to breed relatively low quality fish, producing more low quality fish with zero market (it's already flooded with low quality fish), females aren't the way to go.  Even the loveliest of fish from Petco, Petsmart, or any other chain, do not compare to the quality you'd need to actually have success selling the fry.  The male Guppies are a good choice.    Consider getting 4 or 5 Cories, or if you're lucky enough to find any of the dwarf species (C. habrosus, C. pygmaeus, C. hastatus), 6-10 (these guys are seriously tiny!).  The larger the group, the less stressed they'll be, the more social they'll be, and the happier you'll be that you bought them.  While Otos are often considered schooling or shoaling fish, I disagree-- I've not seen it... ever.  2 wouldn't be a problem, but they won't do much as far as control algae in such small numbers.  Consider 4-7.  They're small, not taking up much space or producing much waste.  Make sure the Cories get sinking pellets, as they will do very poorly on scraps.  Feed the Otos blanched lettuce, zucchini, spinach, cucumber, etc. to supplement their algae-based diet, as well.|`|FrAXx2iaaa	Remember that for each inch of fish you have you need one gallon of water, unless it is a cold water fish like goldfish then you need three gallons per inch.  Your fish should work fine together.  There might be a little bit of nipping between the males because of the females in the tank.  Make sure you have the right food.  You cories and oto cats are scavengers but they need food too.  Other than needing a filter and thermometer to make sure water temp is right you should be fine.  Good luck.  If you have any questions just let me know.
igxpy62Raa	NO! That cage is WAY too small! Hamsters, especially syrians, will become depressed and bored in a habitat too small, which WILL shorten their lifespan. A single syrian hamster requires a minimum of 1.5-2 sq feet of floorspace.

NLcEHqEqaa	it should be fine. As long as you cleaned it out really well with soap there shouldn't be any bacteria or anything left. The only thing i can think of what would be wrong with it is maybe the hamster can smell the old hamster's scent, but it will get over it eventually as its scent takes over the old scent.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	Chances are it would probably be ok.  However, I would recommend cleaning it with a 1:32 dilution of bleach and water (1 part bleach to 32 parts water) anyway just to be safe.  It's best to be safe and disinfect it.|`|3e0rDOWTaa	I would recommend letting it soak in hot water with a splash of bleach for at least 20 mins and then rinsing it thoroughly.

gHKJmygoaa	Tetra makes a mass market flake food called tetracolor. You should also be feeding them frozen copepods like daphnia, krill, and brine shrimp. Blood worms work wonders for this also.   I noticed that my fish stay brighter and more colorful with an actinic light strip, aka the "Glo Lights".|`|4HV0KknRaa	its probably the quality of your water. i would test your water levels. ut yes they do make tetra color.. however it wont help much if your water is in poor conditon your fish will still be pale|`|OsVswissaa	You should be concerned about water quality and the fishes overall health.  A healthy fish in a clean environment shouldn't lose colour.  I wonder what your ammonia, nitrite and nitrate tests say.
B6zl0AJDaa	I'm in California and if I have a horse who's starting to look a bit "ribby" or I've purchased some rack of bones,  I go out and buy a 50LB sack of A&M (Ground alfafa and molasses) (In the mid west they use beet pulp BUT I've been informed that you HAVE to add water to it or it will swell in a horse's belly causing colic), dump it into a tub or feeder in the horse's stall, then top it with some rolled barley corn that is mixed with corn oil and apple cider vinegar. (I feed a 3LB coffee can of the barley corn mixture once a day.) The horse will normally devour the first couple of bags of A&M, but then they will slack off as they get used to it (Never had an issue with colic or founder)...    I haven't fed oats or any mixed feed in decades, basically because I've had running horses and TBs I'm trying to keep quiet, so I feed the rolled barley corn mixture to them for weight, NOT heat.    I also give my horses a hot bran mash twice a week with a 1/2 CUP of apple cider vinegar and corn oil (I can mix the barleycorn into it.).  I feed 1/2 a 3 LB coffee can of red wheat flakey bran and add enough water to it so that it looks like oatmeal in consistancy.    I make sure that they get 2 flakes of alfafa hay per feeding.     A&M runs about $15.00/50 LB Bag and she can free feed off of it.    Rolled Barley Corn and Bran runs about the same price for 50 LB bags.|`|MaAtfDV7aa	HAY. she will gain bulk if you give her an unlimited amount of hay.. don't attempt to "fatten her up" with grain, you'll just put her at a risk for colicking.|`|Flrnnme1aa	Get her on Purina Strategy with Omelene 100 daily then look up the supplement   NUTRI-PLUS its put out by a company in NY and it is AWESOME works better than any other supplement I have used in the past.

I also using a special fattening feed.|`|XL62syrCaa	I am a big fan of beet pulp. Even at a boarding stable. You bring the beat pulp home, soak it, and feed it then. You just have to let it soak for at least 12 hours. My horse never minded it, IF they do add molasses to it or mix her grain in it. Also make sure you are feeding a high protein hay (like orchard or timothy. You need to stay away from local grass crap o hay) Good luck|`|ihyM9j8laa	I started my 2 old mares on Soya flakes this yr due to loosing weight, they have a cheap mix, speedy beet( 10min soak) so you can make it up by the time your ready after getting her in etc that will be ready too,there on graze on, devils claw and ginger, there both looking so much better in less than 4wks, dont put a massive scoop in to start wiv,start small till they get used to it, good luck,x|`|RoPLmd2daa	Your other question may be a clue- she may not be able to chew properly if she hasn't had her teeth done.  Also, you don't have to soak it overnight- about an hour should be fine with warm water. I usually mix up the food where my horse can't see it before I ride, and then by the time our ride is over, his food is ready. He gets pellets, not actual grain, though (he's getting to be an oldie, and is a TB as well, so it's hard to keep weight on him). He gets a total of 4 pounds a day (2lb morning, 2lb evening) with a cup of corn oil at each feeding, plus free choice of hay 24/7.|`|Oiabe82gaa	You simply need a feed that is high in fat. My guy is hard to keep weight on and he is fed a 14% fat for working horses as well as a 20% fat for older or hard to keep horses. You could also use Rice Bran, which I find really quickly puts weight on.  If there is nowhere to soak Sugar Beet where you board you could soak it at home. We feed beet pulp during the winter and we soak it in an old (cleaned) 5 gallon plastic paint pale with a lid. We soak 5 cups of dried sugar beet in 2 or 3 gallons of water. That would keep your horse going for around two days and takes up very little room as far as storage goes!  As far as hay goes, your horse needs to be getting approx. 25 of its bodyweight in feed, so if you are going to use hard feeds aswell I would go with 1.5% of your horse's bodyweight!!!  Good luck!    EDIT:  OMG, please DO NOT feed beet pulp that has only been soaked for an hour! You MUST soak it for a minimum of 12 hours, you'll be amazed at how much this product swells. If you were to feed it after only an hours soaking most of that swelling would take place in your horses stomach!  Sugar Beet/Beet pulp MUST be soaked for at least 12 hours, that is why most peiople soak it overnight!!!|`|3YHZUuhyaa	i feed beat pulp to my picky mare and she eats it fine. I just mix it in with a cup of oats and sweet feed.   you could also soak some hay cubes in warm water and feed them to her. that puts on weight also. and they love it!    i hope this helps! good luck!|`|at7LXbEfaa	In australia there'ss a thing called Weightt lifter. It is designed for horses that loose weightt easily or quickly.|`|yrHf0ZKWaa	i saw that you posted another question about teeth floating and once you get this done, she will put on a little weight because after their teeth are floated, they use their food better. idk really know why, but this is what my vet told me|`|WDfWklRUaa	Calf-mana is a very good fattener. corn is good in the winter but not in the summer as it is a hot food
5QG9Zrjaaa	According to my vet, young horses have softer teeth and need more frequent attention than an older horse.  As they shed caps and teeth, and to remove any wolf teeth (mares don't usually have wolf teeth, but that is not an absolute).    It's time to have your girl looked at, and you need to continue every 6 months for a couple of years.  After that, yearly should be sufficient.  If you wait until the horse is dropping feed and loosing weight, you've waited 'way too long!  Because of the way horses chew (side to side), they essentially sharpen the edges of their molars with every chew. They will need regular attention, just like you do.    In my state, Kansas, equine dentists must have a Vet in attendance to administer sedation, so most dentists don't come here and we have to use a Vet.  Some Vets have done the extra study and certification to be good at teeth, others just go with the 2 hour lecture they got in vet school.  Fortunately, I use a Vet who has done her homework.|`|RZPLec5Eaa	My mare is 3 and we have had the dentist out. She got her teeth floated and some teeth pulled, I'd say it's time you call a dentist because my mare when she was an early 3 year old wouldn't bridle quite right until her teeth were pulled. So, if your training her it may go better after the dentist is out.    Another thing I suggest...take it or leave it...have a chiropractor out. I have mine out once a year and he does wonders on my horses, it really helps them under saddle.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	If you just got her, you probably should have a vet check her out anyway. If you don't want to do that, then when you get shots, the vet can check her teeth then. Should be no charge to look.  Meanwhile, as long as she is not spitting out food or chewing funny, she is probably ok. Mares generally don't have the wolf teeth everyone talks about (they can, but its not common).|`|Oiabe82gaa	I would have a Dentist look at a young horse by the time it was 2 yrs old, maybe sooner. Annually after that although, some horses can go 18 months between floating. I would definately be having teeth checked before bitting a horse for the first time.    RACH, ignore thumbs up or down, there are alot of ill advised people on here with some crazy ways of thinking!!|`|AA11027121	I have my vet at least check when he comes out to do shots.  That is just to make sure caps and everything are falling off as they should and not causing problems. If you have a good vet they should not push you to get things done before they need to.|`|gJE0ujbzaa	I start having mine looked at yearly when they turn 2. Often, you can prevent problems if you catch them early. Problems such as baby teeth not falling out correctly and causing the adult tooth to come in wrong, which can cause the jaw to end up out of whack.|`|5kUxkun3aa	A young horse should have it's teeth looked at for any possible problems before it ever has a bit in, if not before.   Hope that helps      Edit who ever put thumbs down, would you leave it so you have a youngster in pain. Not coming on it's training. Then get the dentist out|`|p9reiXbnaa	My two year old saw the dentist at 9months old first time just for a check.|`|c21d0003bc4cc7e4b99196c5d509dbd7aa	You should get a dentist to look are your horse before you decide to put a bit in her mouth.  Her wolf teeth need to be removed so that they do not bother her later on with the bit.  We had our filly's wolf teeth removed at age 2.
2c5e899b1f4becdae6ccfc0ddd307dfcaa	Don't put the hamster in the kitchen, fumes could hurt it or kill it. It's something to do with the lining of pans and pots. I had a hamster so I understand this, so I suggest listening to a mp3 player at night to fall asleep. I got use to it, it just takes a week.|`|bhpUw9Nxaa	no, thats kinda gross  hamsters are germy  you dont want that near your food.|`|LiOOF1Plaa	That's nasty, to put the cage in the kitchen. What if she kicked-up one of her specially-flavored "pellets" into your cereal? I would advise against this. Put it in the laundry or bathroom....or better yet- get a non-exercising Guinea Pig instead!|`|A46UYUNNaa	my bird's cage is in the kitchen... i would say yes as long as you don't touch it while you're making food. haha.|`|bed8QNUaaa	sure!! you can put your hamster anywhere~ just dont forget to close the cage!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|C4V11yJLaa	I Would not suggest it but you would get germs on your food, Yucky!.....|`|xyPpruSjaa	If you plan to get a wired cage, the kitchen would be a very bad place. Hamsters can and WILL kick their bedding and poop out of the bars and it WILL get all over. If you're getting a tank, then it will be fine, except certain hamsters can get smell whether it's a wire cage or tank so I wouldn't really want to be smelling my hamster while I eat.    If you need any help or have any questions, you're more than welcome to email me at averyrazno@yahoo.com|`|G1V9Hvldaa	you could put it in the far corner of your kitchen if you really have no other place to put it?    what about in the hallway???|`|dFRgSbTaaa	it's fine but you will need to put it away from sharp objects and wires and food and don't mistake it for a potato|`|3Fma3URSaa	I think it would be fine as long as you clean the cage often and don't prepare food like right next to the cage...|`|pvAX7Gvzaa	Hey    Yes its fine to put a hamster in the kitchen just make sure it is not anywhere near where u prepare food, this is because animal germs can get on to food and have some sort of illness.     Yes you can but keep it clear from food.     Hope this helps :D|`|88SGoW1Iaa	Probably not a good idea. Just take out the wheel at night and put a towel over the cage, most likely she will let u sleep, bc the kitchen is bad for her.|`|L6Q0HBMFaa	I had the same problem with my hamster it kept me up all night! And I had 2! Any who I would say no! Its very unheatly to do so and you could get bactira in your kichten and in your food! The person that said ants will crawl all over it is right it will end up happending and that is just gross.... Any who, I hoped that I helped you answser this quesiton in every way possible!  |`|v9ihmSoNaa	YOU KNOW THAT IT MIGHT SMELL. I WOULDNT PUT IN THE KITCHEN. AND YEAH THOSE HAMSTERS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE ON THE WHEEL AT NIGHT. IF YOU WANT THO YOU COULD ALWAYS TAKE THE WHEEL OUT AT NIGHT.|`|3e0rDOWTaa	no. It is very unhygenic. Keep the hamster in your bedroom or living room until night then just put it in the bathroom or somewhere like that and bring it back into your room in the morning. Or get a new wheel that is silent. Wodent Wheels are good for syrian hamsters (aka teddy bear, golden etc) and Silent Spinners are good for dwarfs.|`|V61k9jGKaa	its alright i guess. but once i put mine in the kitchen, and a few monthes later, ants covered it head to toe|`|9kKSIfX7aa	no they eat everything like termites but bigger|`|jg3bbxR8aa	even tho she runs on her wheel youll get used to it- i did. of anywhere don't put it in the kitchen|`|QWXHz8V2aa	I don't see why you shouldn't be allowed to do so, as long as you keep the cage away from any objects that the hamster might be able to reach and eat. It shouldn't be a problem, and it's good have to a hamster cage near activity, so she should be fine.|`|Y5lvOTMbaa	as long as you keep the cage clean it should be fine and just make sure the shavings dont get thrown onto the counter, maybe put some newspapers under it and change it daily,|`|qRN84CjTaa	No, if you put it in the kitchen, some diseases enter your food and you could get seriously sick. Try a place that is no where near food and a place where she can't bother you. =)
86b135e0c5c7fa8152fab546e88b509caa	There's no guarantee that you manage to get female Angels - they are near impossible to visually sex. You'd only be able to get two females by splitting up a bonded mature proven pair. I like wild-type and marble Angels.    Hardy plants include vallis, hygrophilia, anubias, java fern, java moss, cambomba, and sometimes crypts and swords. Floating plants include pennywort, just move them aside when you're feeding.  http://www.tropica.dk  http://www.plantedtank.net    Angelfish friendly fish are mostly relatively peaceful bottom dwellers, like Corydoras.    Where to buy depends on where you live, scout all the aquatic stores near you.|`|OsVswissaa	Sorry I don't have a answer for all your questions, but if you want the best quality you have to buy from a breeder.  Pet stores have the worst quality of all.|`|P3w07SsGaa	well angel fish coloring is really up  to u everyone is different i could say like a brown and black and u can completly disagree thats 100% up to u noww petsmart has good plants u can try there and also petsmart has good fish my newer fish like my electric blue cichlid, african cichlids,female convict,and my pacu came from there and there all healthy i have only lost 1 fish from there that i can recall and that was a needle fish but he lasted like 3-4 months i really think he was sick so i trust petsmart i get all my fish stuff from there (except my piranha stuff because they dont sell them or their water conditioners) now ur plant arrangement them floating is ok when u feed them they will move the plants out they way because fish smell food more then they see it so u'll be fine with floating plants   now hardy fish that are angel compatible is an iradescent shark there not colorful really but they are STRONG i use to have one who ran into the heater so hard he broke it got shocked and survived.....and he wont fight with ur angel fish unless ur angel fish is like 12 inches and ur shark is 3 u should be fine     hope i helped u a little bit    -Nick|`|7KxQXHzOaa	my favorite color pattern is a red w/ orange they would look beautiful|`|wnnudNp5aa	I recommend buying a book about aquariums, it will answer all your questions, and will a handy reference in the future. Generally, neighborhood pet stores have better quality products than the big chain stores. See if there is one in your area. Good luck!|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	go to tank advance.com it works i got 5 male angel fish from there they are now 5 years old|`|LzcTwj7kaa	i buy from petsmart and they usually have what im lokking for so buy from there i also used to worked there their not all  bad only certain petsmarts.
h4wNRqf9aa	not all animals need air, DR.. but im assuming you mean oxygen...    no, no fish deserves to die in a tiny, unfiltered, stagnant bowl|`|Qq9dRq6Oaa	If you looking for a (relativly) low maintance fish that doenst require air filters.  I recommed a Betta (Siamease fighter) I have 2 of them each in a 10 litre bowl.  As I don't have filters in the bowls they require weekly water changes (30%) at least.  They are resilient fish and very easy to keep.  Although bettas do much better in filtered and heated tanks they can still survive in smaller bowl/tank just pls make sure you have at least 10 litres.  I'm upgrading the tanks soon as I want to get some filters/heaters etc.  Hope this helps|`|OsVswissaa	those tiny little fish you see in pet stores are almost always schooling fish, so you can't have just one.  Goldfish won't work they needs massive amount of space.  Bettas need excellent water quality so not that either.  Life in a bowl is no life for any fish.|`|wCcioHqVaa	Get a betta and clean the tank every 2-3 days|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	All fish need air. No fish can survive in a bowl contrary to what people think.|`|mitqrpIHaa	Typically, you would need a tank that could fit around a gallon (4.5 litres) of water. Even for a fish of that size. If there is not enough water the water will become stale quickly and would not provide enough oxygen for the fish. If that happened the fish would become unhappy, unwell and then die.   It is possible to house a fish without out a filter but you would have to do water changes of around 10-20% of the water every week to put the oxygen back into the water, with a filter you would not have to change the water as often, but it would still need to be changed a couple of times a month.  If you are trying to get a low maintainence fish, goldfish are ideal because you can use tap water and they like their environment to be as natural as possible. But like all living animals they still need to be looked after and you should always make sure they have a good quality of life. If you cannot provide this, you should re-think getting a fish altogether. Hope this helps. :o)|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	All fish need oxygen. Every living organism needs oxygen.    No fish deserves to be put in a bowl.    *edit. lmao. oops.
3sB49YNnaa	The fact that they are ignorant is not your fault.  You tried.  The fact that they are allowing her to back breed is not ideal for the sow but is not outside the rules of humane treatment that the UDSA allows for commercial guinea pig colonies.  What is legal, what most breeders would do and what some people would like are not the same thing and, in this case, what is legal is what takes precedence as far as forcing them to do anything.      Calling the humane society will not do anything except get your friend and/or her parents pissed off since they will win in court if it gets that far.|`|bEQn0Vrtaa	If they did not have the information and did something out of ignorance that is one thing. They do have the information and clearly  do not care about the health and welfare of the pigs, call your local SPCA and have them go out and view the pigs, maybe that will scare them a bit. It is nice to know there are responsible people in regards to pigs, so many think they are just fun fur balls that you can do what ever fits your needs.|`|3e0rDOWTaa	they MUST seperate the male from the female and baby. With the male there, the female can get pregnant again and could get very stressed, which would not be good for the baby. And they should keep the male and female seperate until they get the male neutered.   It is not good for them to be continuously breeding, especially when they are so young. I am guessing the owners know nothing about breeding?   If the male is not removed, he could also breed with the baby if it is female or mother could breed with it if it is male (when it is old enough) This is dangerous as they are related and can cause deformities in future offspring if it happens.   please make them remove the male. And get the baby sexed when it is old enough so there is no inbreeding.|`|FWlSFpByaa	Usually the female defends hereself and her baby from the father so its really nothing to worry about. My guinea pigs had babies but never tried to mate while the babies were in the cage
1aad8722e71ef75268d8e2b77cd59083aa	1 305 would be a little better but you could get by with the205 u would just have to do filter changes more often  2 you will need a protein skimmer might want to get a power head filter to keep water movement at a higher level for an anemone  3 not necessary but they are very nice and will reduce the amount of filter changes    when you get it all set up with salt and everything wait at least 1 week before you get any fish and at least 1 month before getting that anemone  anemone's are very hard to keep alive if water levels are not ideal  get a good test kit and test often it is easier to resolve a problem in the water if you catch it early|`|h4wNRqf9aa	1. a 305 would be getter the 2 will work  2. yeah, a skimmer and maybe a few extra powerheads, as well as live rock  3. no, you don't need one but they are great filters      you're also going to need a light for the anemone.. depending on how long and deep the tank is maybe a 2-3 bulb T5 unit, 1-2 bulbs actinic, and one 10,000K        yeah both a 205 and 305 would be great.. i meant get the 3-5 instead of the 2 but both would be even better  be sure to clean out the filter media often, if not you will get high nitrates and possibly blow out the motor, but that's true of canister filters on any tank...
aD1no2cWaa	That would be fine for a corn snake, but you should see if you can put it on a low setting or put something like a cloth over top of it so it doesn't burn your snake. And you would also need to put a heat lamp or a heat pad in there too, to keep him healthy and happy. Your snake will be nice and warm with that in there too.    -Erin|`|QrFpYxaBaa	No, you shouldn't. It'll burn the poor thing, get a heat lamp or heat mat instead.|`|u61yKsE3aa	I would never use a heat rock for a young snake.  An adult corn snake can use a rock if it is one that is temp. controlled.  These rocks will turn off at a certain heat to prevent burns.  But this should still only be used for adults and a light is a better option.  Good Luck.|`|YNusCvP5aa	Any care-sheet I've ever read cautions against the use of a heat rock.  An under-tank heater that covers 1/3 to 1/2 of the tank would be best.      I personally use the exo-terra desert heat mats as that's what my local pet store stocks.  My only complaint with them is that of the 7 I've bought, 2 have died (a poor ratio).  I've never had problems with over-heating though.|`|N6NunLGVaa	my gecko loves it. and my brothers snake likes it so go for it!|`|J006Npwdaa	NO NO NO!!!!! it will burn your snake they are not good. for heat just get a heat pad or a red infrared heat lamp|`|KNWWLkYoaa	definatley do not get a heating rock. heating rocks hold too high of a risk of burning the snakes. use a lamp or a mat or both.|`|b3pRYXkUaa	no dont use mine gotburned from oneplease dont put one in|`|nmzpdvkqaa	NO!
8cikAYp3aa	to medicate my snapping turtle i put the pellets inside a small goldfish or large rosy red.  It needs to be in something small enough she will gulp down.      Another thing I did when she was small 3inches or so  was to not feed her for  4 days, turn the heat up on the water so it was Warm 75-80,  Then ground up the pill and put it in a bit of hamburger.  fed of course by bamboo tongs.. I do like my fingers..   She gulped it after being teased with a small bit.|`|aD1no2cWaa	You should put the medicine inside her food.

Cory's are small and like to be in groups, but a 10 gal with all those other fish is kind of small. I would get three cory's.|`|rdp95817aa	get a few snails they don't bother any of the fish and the fish leave them alone and they eat the algae all fish have no problem with them

They are a hard chew that is either destructable or indestructable. They come in all those flavors. You can find them at most stores.
51f2255c1cc69004179982865a0135e1aa	take her to the vet?!?!?!?!?!?!?|`|81675c7bcc2aa81478472216e01229f7aa	Make sure she stays calm for the rest of the night.  No playing, jumping, etc.  The only way to know for sure if it's broken is to take her to get an xray.  If it is broken, you shouldn't hesitate to get her leg casted otherwise it could heal improperly and that could lead to surgery or worse case scenario, amputation of that leg    I also wouldn't recommend  giving her any pain meds because that will make her pain better and she may start walking around causing more injury to her leg.|`|sTQuLOh3aa	If you can't take her tonight, keep her calm and off the leg.    If you have a crate, now would be a good time to crate her.  If not, confine her to a bathroom or laundry room so she doesn't injure herself further.    To go to the potty - leash only.  You may want to put a towel under her as a sling to help support her.    Do NOT give her Asprin, Tylenol or Ibuprophen.   Dogs should not take any human pain killers.    This is how we've treated dogs with torn ACLs (knees) and hip replacments or hip surguries (FHO) or anyone else with limb injuries in the rescue where I volunteer.     For my own peace of mind, I'd call my vet tonight and ask.  If your vet isn't in, I'd call and ER vet.  The possibility of a broken leg worries me much more than a sprain.       Tomorrow, get her into the vet and get her seen.  I'm sure she will be fine but you want to make sure she doesn't injure herself further tonight.    Just remember that the stuff you read here can be good advice but I'm not a vet and most of the other posters aren't either.  You can call them and ask the experts!      Good luck and I hope she gets better soon.|`|36360b838d6d49b1da800af8419b3892aa	Would you leave your ankle sprained or broken overnight?        NICE|`|iGeFmo7Yaa	Without an exray you won't know if it's broken or not.  Keep her quiet overnight and hope for the best tomorrow!|`|3dF0lKfBaa	Just keep her off of her leg until you take her to the vet. If it is really sprained or broken she won't put it on the ground when she is walking she will hold it up in the air. Also if she broke it you can feel it if you feel her leg. Good Luck I hope she is okay.|`|0c15d80d4c0586cd39f51607e7ec930faa	Get a newspaper and roll it up about the size of your dog's leg.  Slip it over the leg, and then wrap an ace bandage around it gently.  Make sure your dog rest it's leg.      You can also give put an ice pack on it' s leg, make sure it's not too icy or he'll jump.       Get the dog to the vet ASAP|`|E4UcsbE7aa	A sprain may heal itself, just keep an eye on the pain level and that it's not broken. You should be able to wait on the vet till tomorrow. A baby aspirin should relief some pain if needed. Let it rest and drink water.|`|b3af48a7956596e9b98e122a5e51b828aa	If it's broken, she won't weight bear on it at all. If she is touching down with it while trying to walk, your probably looking at a sprain/strain. Depending upon whether it's rear or front though, you could be looking at an ACL rupture(which has to be corrected by surgery). If it's a rear leg & she's not in any pain when the leg is manuvered, it could be that.  If it's a sprain, your vet will start your dog on some type of anit-inflammatory medication for a few weeks & tell you to rest the dog - even if that means kenneling them up for a couple weeks. It's better for the dog not to use the leg.   I hope it's nothing serious !!!|`|8202aadbb0248837296c2295fb846f78aa	if our dog sprained her leg then i would carry it evry where and take very good care of it next time!|`|74920785fde3b7931e8b30679d4d7cd5aa	If you have a crate that would be the best thing for her tonight. just to keep her quiet and still until you can get to the vet tomorrow.Hope shes feeling better.

OsVswissaa	Keep it in the right temp and Clean water and it should grow back without meds.  If you feel like you want to add something try polyaqua, it's a really good water conditioner that's not going to interfere with the slime coat.  You don't need meds unless you see infection or bacteria though.  If you really need meds try Maracyn or Maracyn II, melafix and pimafix and those things are irritants, which in theory will promote the slime coat but are not appropriate for treating a wound.  Scales should grow back just fine there might be some scaring.|`|7KxQXHzOaa	u should buy the stress coat water conditioner it should help|`|YWlSB3esaa	most likely u will have to buy some products like melafix, etc. some scales may grow back but the others won't, one time my goldfish fell on floor, but its scales grew back, then the other time my cichlid ate some scaless off, they never grew back
dB3Gu0Ypaa	2 to 5 day should do it I hope you have a healthy brood|`|MpTZjdLJaa	well first u should get atleast 2 female for every male. that would be a lot better. otherwise, if u see the female becoming a little bloated, shes pregnant.|`|QV6swGUMaa	as said i would get another one or 2 females and then will take maybe a month and they should have fry when the male is in with them.breed like rabbits so they do.my guppie had 11 fry the other day.
rrFbQZzIaa	here is a link to a picture that will help you find out: http://www.kingsnake.com/gladescs/bearde...  as said by others, lift the tail up and at the base above the vent you will see a bulge in the mi ddle, which means it's a female, or a dimple in the middle and two hemipenal bulges on the sides, which means it's a male. Males will also have a small set of pores on their below the vent along their hind legs.   Now depending on how old or big your dragon is, you may have trouble telling. When my dragons are born, I can accuratenly sex most, but it still can be tough w/ some of them. So if your dragon is only 5-7 inches, you may have a little difficultly|`|xQtnTKCAaa	Hold the beardie with his tummy on the palm of your hand with his tail facing you.  Lift his tail straight up.  Above the vent there will either be one rounded bump above the vent on the base of the tail or two lumps side by side with the center dimpled.  The one bump would be female, and the two with the dimple would mean a male.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	i agree with onecalla...|`|TUxP0XzWaa	Hey,   I just got a bearded dragon like last week, and I had the same question. From what i've found out one way to tell is to look by it;s tail. When you lift the tale up  there will either be one bump below the tail or two bumps side by side. one is female ...two is male. hope this helps.|`|xLb8zvdmaa	the tale thing is right, but plz note that u wont be able to tell if its a baby or juvie, it has to be at least 6 months old.
3ybVdfMEaa	No. Separate them immediately.    They might get along now, but sooner or later, one will turn on the other -- probably the male will attack the female -- and you'll have a dead or injured fish on your hands. And my guess is, even now, one or both of your fish is highly stressed by the other's presence (this stress increases the risk of illness). Bettas are solitary fish. They do not get lonely, and they do not want others of their kind in their territory. If you're considering breeding your bettas, you need to do research. It's not as simple as throwing them in the same tank.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	My male and female got alone really well for about two weeks. Then I saw him corner her and rip her tailfin, so I separated them immediately.    It depends what tank size you have. Most other species of betta can actually be kept in pairs in 20-30 gallon tanks. But for a betta splendens, I wouldnt risk it. Separate them now.|`|AA12153474	It's best not to keep them in the same tank.  They may get along for a little while or a long time, but eventually they will fight.  Get another tank to keep the female in.  Another option is to get a much larger tank and put a divider between the two.|`|ZynsCbudaa	He will always bother her to mate, thats why you should get another female, but as long as he doesnt bother her to the point to where she cant handle it anymore, then they will prolly get along just fine.|`|dB3Gu0Ypaa	yes i had a pair of bettas male and female together they were so happy but when the girl died he got sick and die to =(|`|OsVswissaa	Get ready for a disaster.

14YGePYoaa	I think that if you wanted to get a frog, then you should try and put it in another tank. You could always try putting it in with your other fish... and have a back up tank with some smaller slower not aggressive fish like neons tetras     good luck... hope this helped|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The danios should actually rip the betta apart sooner or later. But anyways.    ADFs do best by themselves or with slow moving fish. They have problems getting food to the bottom so they can actually eat it. Most fish will eat their food before they even know its there.|`|MPQI8Bg3aa	You would want to get a couple as they like company. If you are going to get them I suggest getting some frozen foods. These break up slowly so that some food actually makes it to the bottom for the frogs. Otherwise your Danios and Betta will eat all the food and the frogs will starve.
bEQn0Vrtaa	the cage needs to be placed where it gets good light but not direct sun light as they do not sweat. It can not be in a drafty area or in a area where the temperature changes often. They need climate control much as we do. They cannot live out doors in most climates. They want to be near the person who is going to be its companion, when you have one you need to be its companion and it will bond to you as its companion. This takes a lot of time on your part but it is actually quite easy to work it into a normal life, so both guinea pig gets its emotional needs met and you enjoy it to its fullest. I council youngsters with their guineas and would be happy to help you if you would like guidance. I have had many companion guinea pigs and they are with out question the best and most rewarding pet. carolmoore30@yahoo.com|`|7NNiddPJaa	sorry about your son's best friend...the G.P should have no problems with the change. it would be best to keep it in the MAIN room of the house were evryone is ..start holding it after 2 days..it should take to your son very fast..good luck.|`|QWXHz8V2aa	Even though he is in the same cage, it's best to put him in a quiet environment and try to not take him out right away to play with him. It's best that you leave alone for a while, so he'll get use to his new home. After while, he'll become use to your voice, and you can take him out and such.
rMTq7yMyaa	Yes, they do.    We move in our sleep too.|`|gM7VuCM4aa	Yes cats control their own tails, it is an extension of their spine and very sensitive.

Some cats move their tails constantly because they are happy, or because they are agitated.     try touching her tail. she'll move it away :P|`|gKRLXuXvaa	Dreaming. And they can control their tails as well. If you pinch the end of their tail, they move it.|`|axQvQtbyaa	Yes because when they get mad it goes faster... and every cat moves their tail differently.|`|a4V2FjMQaa	Actually...no....when cats are born....they are born in pairs....so if there is a litter of 6 kittens....then there are three pairs. So (2 kittens) per pair. The opposite kitten in the pair controls the other kitten's tail. This occurs throughout life even as they are separated. So...when your cat is moving its tail....you are actually seeing its brother/sister's actions and thoughts control your cats tail! Amazing right? This is a little known fact about the felion~!~|`|Vzzc6mATaa	No they are all controlled from The  National Cat Control Centre in New York Did you not know that ?|`|87R7rzGCaa	Tails are like faces, they show feelings whether agitated or scared.|`|O0AfxH9Eaa	yes but it's a displacement activity I think, like jigging a foot or nailbiting.

5QG9Zrjaaa	The poster who said Orvis paste is right, that's good and has no fragrance.  It gets stains out of my gray guys well, and puts a sheen on the bays.  It rinses well, and is fairly inexpensive.    Why not just use the same shampoo you use?  Most horse products were once people products.  If it is gentle enough for you, it is gentle enough for your horse!    I am very sensitive to chemicals, and I find I can use Endure (Farnum product) fly spray without a problem.  The tough thing with fly spray is that it is the scent that hides the horse from the bug, and most natural things like vinegar work very well until the horse begins to sweat, then they loose their effectiveness.|`|8cikAYp3aa	best stuff known to man or beast.. wash you.  your livestock,  your quilts ( quilters swear by it)  orvis wa paste http://www.valleyvet.com/ct_detail.html?...

OIRI5Ok7aa	Do you have any baby oil or olive oil?  Try putting a little of that in her bathwater.  I have a dog with dry skin, and that worked like a charm!  Also, her coat is very silky and soft.|`|9zU2KDyHaa	I believe you are bathing your cat way too much.  Is there a medical reason for you having to bathe her.  Using shampoos too often will stop the cats natural oils from moisturizing her skin & fur.  If there is a medical or other necessary reason for shampooing her then maybe you are using a shampoo that is too harsh.  Does she show signs that the dry skin is bothering her.  Is she scratching a lot or is her skin red. If not then stop the baths & let her natural oils come out.    I copied the statement below from the following web site:  http://petcare.suite101.com/article.cfm/...    For cats and other pets, give olive oil directly by mouth or mix the oil in with the pet's food. This will help to heal the pet's dry skin from the inside out. A small amount of olive oil can even be massaged into the pet's skin. The oil is moisturizing for a dog's or cat's skin (and other pets too), and it's non-toxic and edible in the event that the pet ingests the oil when licking the fur or skin.|`|NNiN0tK0aa	Feed her oily fish (mackerel/salmon/sardines/pilchards) at least twice a week or give fish oil capsules every day.  Other oils can also helps - olive oil, avocado, coconut oil/cream.

But if your dog is straining, hunching over like he's trying to go but can't and the mineral oil doesn't work then in the end he may need something like an enema given by a Vet.  Just don't panic and call your Vet if there's no change by Monday and see what they recommend.|`|JiCKFTuIaa	Must be that cheezy diet you have it on (wink)    Constipation is a pretty normal thing and happens to everyone from time to time.

They do to a lot of breeds with long ears like poodles, spaniels. It shouldn't be uncomfortable  but I am sure plenty of dogs don't care much for it -something they get used to in time.|`|ixFbNr4taa	Yes -- they are also called Dog Snoods.  A snood was a type of hair covering from medieval times.  Now, Snoods are designed for floppy or long eared breeds -- they keep the dog's ears from being submersed in their water and food bowls.  Imagine, no more sopping wet or crunchy ears at meal time!       They are often seen on dogs at Dog Shows.  Obviously, grooming a dog can take several hours to get that perfect show look.  So, keeping the dog's ears clean is very important for many breeds.    But I admit -- they look hilarious!!!!!|`|aUAOHcoxaa	lol i agree with the other answers. but i could imagine putting them on my english springer spaniels ears. :)|`|jA1nfMeyaa	Ear wraps and snoods have basically the same function, but are different things.      Ear wraps are the ones pictured in the link you provided and are used on dogs with long ears prior to entering a show ring.  After extensive hours of grooming they wrap the ears to protect the hair from getting wet, dirty, or just plain messed up.    Snoods are this fabric tube thing with elastic bits on the end parts.  You stick the dog's head through the hole and the snood keeps the ears from flopping over when eating or drinking.  They can also be used to help air out the ears.  I used to make my dogs wear snoods when they eat, but they hated them so much that I don't bother anymore. picture of snood:  http://www.toferstoys.com/store/images/u...

A puppy should grow at an "average" rate, not a maximum rate to avoid skeletal problems later.      The best premium food would be one that meets all of the puppy's  growing needs, without having to add supplements.  You can read the ingredients on the label.      No particular brand of pet food is perfect for every pet, not all dogs like the same food.  You may have to experiment a bit with the premium brands before you find one your puppy likes.  You may also want to consult your vet if the problem continues. Good luck and enjoy raising your puppy!

Offer him the food at his scheduled meal time..  leave it for 10-15 mins.. if he doesnt eat it, then pick it up and offer NOTHING else until his next scheduled meal..  it may take a few days, but he will eat.    Put the other dog on a scheduled meal as well. neither dog needs to be free-fed, or find a way to keep the pup away from his food bowl..  you said the food was outside, so use a leash when he's outside.
7igxiGrAaa	My cat is the same way. For some reason he always knows when I'm in the bathroom. He is constantly at my feet if I don't close the door quickly enough and he's trying to climb in my lap while I'm trying to do my thing.  If your cat is trying to get water from the bathtub or toilet it could be a sign of kidney failure- just keep an eye on that and his regular water intake.  My cat has many strange habits that I don't understand, haha. He'll put his paws up on the oven handle and watch me cook dinner, or he'll paw at the dishwasher and laundry washer like he was trying to paw at cat litter. Strange little guy, I tell ya. Half the time I think he's convinced he's a dog instead of a cat.|`|rAa8bfhwaa	He can **** off in piece there|`|DZB0WCmmaa	Ours used to jump onto the bin and from there on the handle of the door, as if trying to open it. And was quite succesful!|`|qSMF6QIYaa	He may be thirsty or likes baths.  My cat use to drink out of the toilet lol. And she would go near the bathtub but she hated baths.|`|VDvdrCjmaa	My cat would always go to the washroom when I needed to :P Mine jumped in the tub when I was taking a bath x]  and maybe your cat is just suspicious of the stuff in there, or maybe the shiny brightness is distracting :P    -Renniee.|`|AoLS7XXTaa	Its winter. It may be warm in there. My kitteh does the EXACT same thing!   Cats like comfy warm places that have obstacles. My cat tries to climb the walls sometimes. :/ But she loves to lie down in the bath tub and sit in the window ceal waiting for birds and stuff.    you cat is perfectly fine!! just curious and entertaining it self ^-^|`|ouEdGHfuaa	maybe it is cool to the skin (fur) or something. My cat use to do that a lot, too. Just sleep in the bathtub.|`|ivlOxlG6aa	awww I love tabbies!!!!!|`|hvFN0JLVaa	playful and the cool temperature of the tile and tub.|`|Z0QvOIH0aa	Sometimes cats like napping on the bath rug. Cats just have a mind all their own. They are very curious about everything.    I left my tub dripping water, and that's what they drank. They loved it.|`|eUiMXcFcaa	Your cat is just really playful, and the bathroom looks to him like a jungle gym.  It's perfectly normal - I used to have a cat who would take naps in the sink.  Cats are just weird :)|`|Cq5y5cgJaa	he might like water?  my cat likes to watch the water go down the drain when any1 flushes the toilet|`|GqTSa85daa	He's a male, maybe he likes the smell of estrogen?|`|8tdlP1rOaa	Both my cats like going in the bathroom.   I have one cat that likes to watch the toilet while it flushes....another, we're not sure if she drinks out of the toilet, but we will always find muddy paws on the toilet seat.   both cats will jump in the bathtub as well    One cat will get in and scratch the back of the tub (no damage to the tub though, i made sure)  she also will drink the water on the bottom of the tub.   Our other cat also does that. she drinks water on the bottom of the tub.     its just fine. cats are curious and likes to go places we go.|`|IROLLdMIaa	hes just playfull|`|zoZaIXigaa	kinda nasty, but he probably just likes the smell.|`|XAT5ZkNmaa	my cat is the same way i think it has to do with people not always going in and out of there|`|3AffceXnaa	idk|`|4DVy8sP1aa	they like fresh water. lol my cat is always in the tub and waits for us to turn it on so he will have more fresh water|`|zBKjUTyNaa	the tiles and ceramic feel good on it's body.    my dogs do it ALL the time  they dont like getting wet however love the cool feeling|`|1MsRJRyhaa	my cat does this.it just means that their curios|`|tRYKdk6Saa	Maybe there are some chemicals in a cleaner, soap, etc. that attract the cat. Also, cats are territorial. Maybe he is just trying to establish the room as his property. Or, he could just be playful.|`|AZKHHfr5aa	My cat does that (he also sleeps in the sink :S      This question has basically been asked before here. I found lots of support for it being commonplace cat behavior, but I didn't see any answers that really satisfied me. The closest was the comment suggesting that cat's see you as an alpha animal and how the poop thing is all part of the alpha dominance. But I'm not convinced that cat's really see us humans as alpha animals in any way. I firmly believe most cats see us as their property, not the other way around.    A lot of people suggested that it was just a good opportunity for cats to get the attention they deserve. But even the most anti-social cats who never want attention will do this. This behavior fascinates me as it seems to be common to almost all cats, no matter what their personality. And I've never known two cats who even had close to the same personality. I'd love to find a cat psychologist who actually   knows something about this so why not AskMeFi?       USE THE SITES BELOW TO ANSWER ALL THE OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT CATS/KITTENS|`|eIS9Vfa2aa	my  cat did so what I did is when I go to bathroom I when my come with me|`|hw4Im2CTaa	Haha, my cat does the same thing. She likes to crawl behind the toilet and take a nap. She also likes to sit in the bathtub. Maybe it's a security thing.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	My kitten loves sitting on the toilet or in the bathtub. I think she watches for the water to move. Some days she'll sit in the tub for an hour watching the water drip from the faucet.|`|gbBVscbJaa	Omg! my cat does that too! my mom says its just something that male cats do?
bFzu835Aaa	I normally sell my peach face babies for $50 non-sexed. I only ask for the cost of the test if the new owner wants to know and have it done before it goes to it's new home ( test is only $25). Occasionally if I happen to get a specific color that's a little harder to produce, I'll ask more if I decide to sell that chick.        The $50 includes the chick, some food to start the new owner off, a hatch certificate, and a print out of the babies exact color mutation along with my info in case they ever need to give the bird back, or anything happens (even years down the road), and the contact info for the vet all my birds go to, along with the closest Emergency Avian vet.    The cost can vary depending on where you're located (some places have many many more lovies in the area, which drives down the price, or hardly any which can drive it up...), sometimes on the color mutation of the bird, and if the bird is sexed or not. So my $50 is just average for my particular area of the US and I like to have the new owners properly prepared before I send any of my babies out. Not all breeders are as thorough.|`|s3tY5YzIaa	I sold mine for 100 when i bred them. I stopped breeding lovies a few years ago because I do not like their personalities when referring to them as pets.     They are too aggressive and bossy. they do whatever they want and do not have much a will to please their owners. I now prefer parrotlets. they are my ultimate fav.

If not, they will fight and kill eachother.     I had one male named "Beowolf" RIP|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	jaws|`|b4b38acbe2582b7a823dd09b00982594aa	We named ours Blue. He was blue, it was really creative, right? : p  I don't know if that was his actual name though, but I referred to him as the blue fish.     But keep in mind that Beta's are actually Chinese Fighting Fish and if you put two males together they will fight to the death. If you have one male and one female they will breed and, if you don't remove the babies at the precise time, they will be eaten. I'm not sure if two females can be kept together. I would just get one male (they're the prettier of the sexes).    Names could be Shark, Nemo, Marco and Polo, something completely different like Lizard. I prefer actual human names for my pets (ex. Samson, Adelaide, Thomas, etc.) but I did once have a turtle named Barcode and a hermit crab named Stitch (Lilo & Stitch).     You could always use a name from a character in a book or movie. A name from mythology would be cool too; like Loki.    Edit: I like Hannah M's answer of Omega and Tres. : )  Just don't put two together!|`|H9Nvo2gxaa	Sushi  Jasper  Rosy  Fish Stick  Coral   Nemo   Marlin  Bubbles     Make sure you get atleast 2.5 gallons per betta. And they also require a heater since they are tropical fish    None of them can be kept together unless you got 4 females in an atleast 10 gallon tank.|`|kRUojpGZaa	if it has a long tail its a boy there most comon so thats probably it.     warrior and titan?    omega and tres? (omega-3 fish oil you know)    belle and cinderella? if a girl
FnrAw2SQaa	Look online they have breeders who sell them.I own two and i bought them for only $5.But other places depending on age and feather varietions they can range from $5-$150.No more then that.You should also check classifieds ads in your area they sell them maybe for alot cheaper.|`|Frji3qbwaa	kno 1 knos|`|17wTcVzvaa	you would want to go to petfinder.com or search google.         the price is between 100 to 300$|`|AA12325046	Breeders will sell them online.

Z7hBhHV7aa	Hamsters are da bomb like tick tick! I ? hamsters and I can see how you want one! Dwarfs are speedy and jumpy but also cute. Teddy bear hamsters are the nicest but they are all nice. Teddies can be long haired or short. There's many different hamsters and you will most likely get a mix-breed. You should go to the library and check out the book it will tell you.|`|IaU6PS23aa	Hamsters are not all as they seem on the videos on youtube.com, I would recommend a rat instead.|`|07qFHL6iaa	You really have to do Research before you jump on a topic. But if you did Research make a deal with your mom. Tell her if you get like... 50% A's on your report card then she'll get you one. Or think up something else.|`|i0aeYnBoaa	dwarfs are great and gentle. and teddy bears are really big but cute. usually they are only about $ 10 anyway. but go to a petstore with a good rep. or look at shelters and rescue oprganizations. also consider good private breeders no backyard breeders.

Basically their contrast to humans.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	I love being around creatures. I always have loved horses, but my family has only had cats, a puppy, mice, fish, and turtles. I consider myself very fortunate for having the privilege to be around them.    They are proof that we simply could *not* have evolved from them.|`|AA10500537	i like animals more than people somdays   they are faithful  to their owner  and dont cheat behind their back|`|YgDO6sxAaa	i love animals because they're so cuddly. especially cute little puppies. they're so cute. and playful to. plus without animals this world will be so boring.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Their habits are fascinating, they are funny and fun to watch.    They are beautiful and/or cute.    many are fluffy and cuddly.    They aren't selfish and greedy like most humans, they are just instinctual creatures acting in the ways that come naturally to them.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	They are so intelligent and often have more reasoning power than humans give them credit for.  They are also compassionate.|`|yltT8FSAaa	I love what animals teach us. I have a few pets and I learn so much about playing and watching them.

N9SZX5mOaa	I strongly advise you to put his wheel back in the cage. They are nocturnal so I doubt that you see him running on his wheel. My hamsters LOVED toilet paper tubes that still had the tiniest little bit of toilet paper on them. Try giving him an unscented tissue also. He will love that! I guarantee it! Since he has a cage with bars you can get some little crittertrail tubes at the petore for not very much money. Also try spending a little more money on bedding so he have burrow really deeply.     Good Luck with your ham ham!|`|L5NMzNVRaa	Try peach chews or a tiki hut, and take it out of its cage and handle it more, my hamster was the same way and now shes very happy!             good luck!|`|v3dN1sSaaa	just go and get some tubes and stuff like that and some hanging sticks so that he can chew them and a see-saw or something they are the sort of things my hamster likes but i don't really know what you want because you send a pic of your hamsters cage i will be able to tell thanks hope i helped|`|0vDLCa24aa	Hamsters are nocturnal and don't like to play at the say time. Maybe your hamster is just sleepy ^^
2rXETYrFaa	yes,a feral cat can be domesticated,my family has done it several times, 1st off can you touch him or her or do they need to be live trapped?  what ever  method works, get them into a room on thier own and away from any other pets until they are vet checked and get used to you and others. slowly introduce contact with small amounts of time and slowly take away thier hiding spots,they will come around.make sure they have plenty of ffod and water and a clean litter box,they may not do anything unless theya re alone though.it took us about 2 weeks using this method with one of our cats,but all are different. our one feral cat is so affectionate now if i dont stop to pet him he jumps onto my shoulder for a hug...so its worth the time and effort. and yes they usually remain wary of strangers for thier whole life.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	If a cat is feral when it's 2 months or more, it's going to be a little feral for its whole life. You can still befriend the cat with some patience, and it might be completely tame and calm around you and maybe other members of the family, but it's going to always act wild around strangers.|`|Caa2zTrfaa	yes it can BUT be very careful not to traumatize it and any ware from 3 months and 1 year|`|0vDLCa24aa	If you're going to domesticate it I suggest you take it to the vet to make sure it isn't unhealthy or invested with parasites or diseases.|`|L48jgZuRaa	Yes. You can surely domesticate it, with the right rules.    It takes about 4-6 weeks for the cats behavior to completely change.  If the commences to act differently, by that i mean in a more normal way then, your work is done. If not then notify Professional domesticating.|`|FQyeGsIyaa	A feral kitten can be more easily domesticated than an adult.  We found a 6-8wk old kitten under the shed.  Within a few weeks she bonded with us and she's become an affectionate lap cat.  However, she's still scared of strangers and hides whenever someone comes to visit.    The links below have information about the process and socialization of the feral cats.  The last one is a story of someones experience doing it.
rrFbQZzIaa	first, if the 55 gallon is a long fish tank, than the 40 breeder would be better for the dragon. Dragons need a wide tank b/c of their tail. Now between the two, It's tough to say b/c it all depends on what you're looking for. I'd say a B n W argentine. They're smart like cats, they're gentle and something you can interact w/ a lot more but they get large and can be expensive. Bearded Dragons are nice, they're easy, hardy, but they're so common. Again, it's all about what you're looking for out of your reptile|`|eSoU2C3Waa	beardies are way more docile then the tegu's.  A 55 gal is fine for a beardie but bigger is needed for the tegu.
DVtulTReaa	the bags of miniature carrots are excellent treats for dogs. They are good for them, they don't get gunk in the dog's teeth--they will actually help keep the dog's teeth cleaner, and dogs like them. They are super easy to keep around and best of all, you can share them with your dog. They are low calorie so if you are training your dog, several of them won't make him fat.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Baby or cut up raw carrots.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	Dog biscuits are for dogs. Too much human food isn't good for them! Stick to the dog biccies.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Carrot or broccoli or cauliflower or apple slice or orange piece or banana piece.|`|C1Cobi1taa	try fruits or veggies... my dog LOVES carrots! just make sure you introduce them slowly so it doesn;t upset the tummy.. don't give him grapes/rasins(they cause renal failure) onions, or garlic(toxic to dogs)!   carrots are a great low cal treat that my vet reccommended... my dog loves bananas, nectarines and about anything else! no table scraps though!
uTIgyCCHaa	Female dogs in general tend to be calmer than males, but you must also consider that individual personalities can vary quite a bit from dog to dog, no matter the sex.  Females DO tend to be more protective of their family, so make sure she is well socialized from an early age so that she doesn't "protect" to an extreme degree.  You don't ever have to worry about socializing her too much.  If there ever comes a time when you truly NEED protecting, her instincts will kick in.|`|mJ9BveFjaa	Sure...|`|TyMJAptJaa	It depends on how females mom and dad were like. If they were wild and crazy then the female rottweiler will turn out like them but, if the females mom and dad were nice and calm then the female will be like that.
3YHZUuhyaa	aww he is soooo adorable!! my horse does that too. I think its just because they're full of energy. i think he's just being playful!  my gelding does it when i'm riding him sometimes too. he'll see something that he's curious about and he'll start snorting. he sometimes does it when he's nervous or excited. when my horse does it, it doesn't sound quite like your horse but i think they're both doing it for the same reason.    ahh your horse is soooo cutee!! and gorgeouss!!|`|AA11027121	They are just excited and that is how they are showing it.  It is one of the ways they are communicating they are excited.  They will also sometimes do it when they are nervous about something they may let out a snort to express this.  My gelding does it when we ride by our neighbor that has a llama and he gets a little excited about it and he lets out a good snort to let me know.|`|pMUIH7xxaa	I am not for sure but i think it is just a way they communicate and i think that one means "I'm hyper".|`|5kUxkun3aa	I would say the horse in the video has seen  something. He keeps snorting at it then throwing his back legs at it.   Horses also  do it after exercise or just at rest|`|AA10986942	He is excited and checking out his territory.... they blow through their nose to clear their nasal passages so they can then smell the air.... in their excitement they are checking for any dangers and their sense of smell is a very good warning sense.  a lot of animals do this... you will also hear deer do this when they are trying to figure out if there is danger around...  Its not that he is scared he is just excited and checking things out....|`|RUzBDX6Jaa	Why do we laugh?  Its the same question, but different habits.  Its just a release of air.|`|WbKu0t5taa	that is a goood questionn..  idk really but i kinda think that wen they are running around they get stuff in there nose, and they are blowing it out!|`|KyHiCSKeaa	I know some horses that do it for "fun" and some that do it to clear their nostrils.|`|motYSp5waa	No, its because he is scared of the camera or he is saying stay out of my space and is being moody and Territorial        barrel racer/pole bender/horse owner for 7 yrs  hope this helps!  Mykkie|`|P3iDm6zCaa	When your horse hasn't been worked or you are feeding them high energy food, they often go spastic. My friends horse does that all the time when she runs around silly. I think they hold in their breath when their galloping around and then they let it all out in one huge blow.  Our horses are kept in the suburbs, and it echoes through the houses across the road! Nothing to worry around, it's just a horse being a horse.    BTW. if you didn't think your horse had arab in it...he definitely does!  Look at his head! He's very pretty.|`|q5wKgjacaa	There must be  mare in heat close by. It is a display for mating.|`|Zc7XgGslaa	hes cleary dirt from his nose, like a sneeze, dw its a chillll thing to do
tPGxPDvBaa	All you can do is take to the vet & let them finishing cutting it & cauterize it. They can clean & wrap it necessary.  This is not something for an owner to do.  You probably would not be able to stop the bleeding at home & best to let someone else be the bad guy cuz it is painful.|`|KxjUim7yaa	You need to remove the ripped part so it doesn't catch on things, Use direct pressure to stop the bleeding. Call you vet for advise.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	flour for now just take a pinch n put it on should clot the bleeding but try to bring him to a salon or vet they ll take care of him|`|nbGf6udUaa	IT WILL STOP ON ITS OWN. once it dries up a bit, cut it off w/clippers.he wont like it, but be brave|`|C1Cobi1taa	take him to the vet! wrap the paw until you get there to stop the bleeding! he could get an infection if you don't take him and is probably in alot of pain! good luck!|`|MA5Jspdqaa	Omg are you seriously asking that? You're a horrible dog owner if you haven't taken him to the vet yet. I'm sorry, but it's true. Get him there immediately! Try wrapping it up in gauze in the meantime, and be sure no more blood loss can occur (or try to minimize it).    In the future, if you ever have the urge to come and ask something like this on Yahoo! Answers, go to the vet first. Don't let your dog suffer.    ***Do NOT try to 'heal' him yourself! He needs pain medication and probably some numbing of the paw if they were to remove it. They meaning the vet. You have no experience to do this since you are asking us on here. Good luck to the little guy...|`|aUAOHcoxaa	in dogs dewclaws can cause problem thats why nowadays alot of breeder shave tem removed. if you can get to a vet tonight i would recommend it. if not i wouls bandage it untill morning and then take him. the vet will know what to do. or if you really dont wanna go to a vet, call your vet and tell them whats happened and ask if there's anything you can do at home.|`|2bqXYdQ4aa	ok calm down. get a slightly warmed cloth or flannal and gentaly place it on the wound ring a vet now and talk to your dog keep he/she calm tell them u will b right there sit he/she on a chair make them comfy give him lots of love and please ring the vet tell me how it goes good luck|`|AjFA8qIxaa	You need to take him to the vet, pronto! Help the bleeding slow down or stop by applying pressure with a steril ( clean will do) towel and drive him to the vet! what should worry you is not the bleeding but the ripped claw the infection he will most likely get if you dont get it treated. He might also need stitches.|`|q9075Yawaa	to stop the bleeding...put some flour in a small bowl and dip the wounded paw into it...the flour will cause the blood to clot, this will stem the bleeding.  as for the limp, it will go away when the pain wears off, it may take a day, but he'll get over it....give him a hug while you're at it, a little sympathy is due.

4aAhEK9daa	There's no such thing as brown eyes in cats.  There is copper but that usually only shows up in cats of a particular breed.  Most domestic cats have eyes that are yellow, green or if they have pointed markings, blue.    Unless you have papers to prove otherwise odds are your cat is no particular breed - just like over 97% of the cats on this entire planet.  Is there striping in the coat at all?  Or is it a solid color?  I would guess your cat is a Red and White or Red Mackerel Tabby and White domestic shorthair - http://www.clock.org/~ambar/cats/jpgs/th...  Red Tabby is far more common that solid red.  In fact, I would guess it's about 99% chance your cat has tabby markings.    Odd that you wouldn't know if his coat is orange or brown.  How often do you ever have this cat around you?|`|gjMJzfoeaa	You have a Domestic Short Hair (DSH) cat. This is a catch-all phrase for cats not professionally bred.|`|tnTxHVO5aa	If he has long hair, he is a domestic long hair    If he has short hair, he is a domestic short hair.|`|rpA9y3Wuaa	You are the proud owner of a tiger!!|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	Sounds like a regular house cat.  Enjoy, cats are wonderful!    nfd?|`|0vDLCa24aa	Seems like a Regular short-haired kitty cat if you ask me ^^|`|RN1wGlWWaa	Most likely he's a domestic shorthair mix.  If you are calling the color "orange' - then he's a Red Tabby.  If the stripes are like the fish (vertical) - then a Mackeral Tabby; if swirls or bullseye pattern on the side - he's a Classic Tabby.
q5DTcOuaaa	Oh my gosh no!!! That would be catastrophic!!|`|Az8JInKdaa	Why not? Both are creatures of God.   A turtle has a powerful and uncrushable shell for protection.    Ball Pythons, Python regius (also know as Royal Python) are a relatively small and docile specie of snake, which are native to Western and West-Central Africa. If you have purchased a Ball Python from a pet store, chances are it was born in either  Togo, Benin, or Ghana. They are called 'Ball Pythons' because, when frightened, they coil around their head and into a ball.    Ball pythons are in the same scientific family as other Boas and Pythons, as such they are constrictors. The term constrictor refers to their method of subduing food by coiling around the intended item, a small mammal, and suffocating it. Ball Pythons prefer to live in areas of mixed grassland and trees (savanna), and are active at night (nocturnal). They hunt at night with the help of their labial heat pits, and their Jacobson's Organ. During the day, they spend their time hiding in underground rodent burrows or termite mounds.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	umm ... idts (i don't think so)|`|nI8G21y8aa	no. different species can/shoud lve in the same tanks. No NoNoNoNoNo|`|u61yKsE3aa	In a tank that small no, that tank is to small for your ball once it is an adult.  In large enclousers (room size)  You can mix balls with certain turtles or tortoises.  But this should only be done by poeple who know what they are doing to ensure each animals health and only with species who would naturally live in the same location. I hate when people say you should never mix species.  Many succesful zoos, educational displays and breeders do so successfully not to mention many animals coexist in the wild and will ga as far as sharing the exact same location( ie den)|`|F3FrZ7eAaa	No! Yeah, the turtle has a shell but the turtle can still hurt the snake. That's a really really bad idea. Also, for the most part they have different habitats, so one of them will be unsatisfied. Another reason is they can give each other mites or some kind of parasite. Spend a few extra dollars for an extra tank.|`|8yBdZEQQaa	well it depends on what kind of turtle you have, but most vets say that different repties should have seperate tanks.
JGq9rKBOaa	There is no way to know unless you know the genotype of the parents.    Albino masks other genes, so essentially your albino mouse could be carrying anything.    There are also a bunch of different types of 'grey' mice. Dove, lilac, etc. All of those colors are genetically different.     Read through this:  http://www.arborwin.com/lmc/mg/index.htm...    If the parents have no genes in common, you'll get a whole litter of 'agouti' or 'normal' mice. If they both are aa or Aa - and in pet store mice, aa (non-agouti) colors seem most common - you might end up with a whole litter of black mice. It has very little to do with the actual color of the parents.|`|fbGv4iZ1aa	WIth animals there is no way to tell just exactley what color the fur will come out to.  There is so many diffrent past contributors to the lineage.  With people you can go back down the line and see what most likley your childs hair color may be ect.  But every once in awhile a generational gene dominates and you ask "why does billy have red hair, no one in the family has red hair?" go back far enough and great great great uncle joe probably had red hair.  WIth animals especially what they call "breeders" the ones who's job it is to breed massivley for ample food supply of other animals, there are so many family lines that you could have two black mice breed and get a tan mouse with white and red spots and no black at all.     Hope I explained that ok.  Tigger    p.s.  Don't ever say that one "looks like you :)"
blhIjLr8aa	Haha.  What John said.|`|wNI0D7A9aa	Nothing, Clover will probably always bite.|`|XLJjNmjGaa	not put your finger near its mouth|`|AXTUWKwcaa	Turtle's are more of a pet that you should look at to enjoy, not pick up and play with. If you really want to pick it up and stuff you just have to really get it to trust you. Then maybye it wont bite|`|ld2vmypNaa	theses are NOT cuddly hold me type pets.    They sleep at the bottom of rivers, streams. lakes or ponds or your tank to avoid predators like coyotes,  foxes, owls, hawks, possums, raccoons and even some wide mouth bass and us humans,.Their bite leaves a NICE "V" shaped scar|`|Wn3LGHTvaa	Stop handling Clover and let him (or her) be.
gM7VuCM4aa	It is perfectly fine to use baby shampoo on a kitten, especially since baby shampoos have a no tear formula. There is no need to go out and buy a fancy cat shampoo. You can also use Dawn dish soap, it works well to get rid of "kitten greasies", just don't get it in their eyes. Have fun!|`|ZncV5gc0aa	I wouldn't wash them. What you can use is a baby type brush or a fine comb to brush the particles out from their hair. Kittens are supposed to be stinky. That's okay, their Mommy washes them just fine.|`|OfL7FjA0aa	Yes it usually is thats what i bath my dogs with sometimes otherwise try 2 find some kitty shampoo
hKfVit0Laa	grass believe it or not can really build of celulose in the stomach and this can really make him sick. burnt wood is like charcoal and cancel out and digest the grass easier. plus a cow eat almost any plants on the field some of it might've made it sick. so it's eating the charcoal to cure his/her stomach ache. i hope this helped|`|9743a4b9136d6937a430cb49e25563baaa	cows eat everything|`|8GDd6lrnaa	for the charcoal. my grandmother said it was good for the digestion.
3tClNAISaa	get a new dog|`|tmckNa4baa	Maybe ur dog is just scared or has he been abused before? Cause abused dogs may have fought other dogs and maybe r scared of them now. But that abusing thing is probably not the case. Dogs usually like other dogs when they r first introduced to them young i think. So introducing them later wouldnt be very helpful and may cause problems. Im not exactly sure at this but if the barking and hating at other dogs continue u should go to a dog trainer =D|`|ixFbNr4taa	Yes -- you don't say how old your dog is....but they are never to old to learn to behave.      You need to socialize your dog -- so take him to an obedience class.  This lets him learn what you want him to do.  It also exposes him to dogs and that being around other dogs is a good thing and not a scary thing.  My dog quickly learned to LOVE his classes -- he got so excited to go.  He'd jump, bark and run down the hall whenever I'd get my training equipment together (leash, treats, ball, etc.)  Be sure to tell your instructor that you want your dog to become more socialized.  Many training centers offer puppy socialization classes.  If  your dog is the right age - enroll him in that class.  If he's older - ask the school if he can still enter.  Some schools will allow this especially if the older dog is small.      Get training (positive reinforcement or clicker training are my favorites) -- it will help!!!  GOOD LUCK!!!|`|VQ5gX1m0aa	try to distract her while other dogs come around like give her treats and say he or she is a good dog|`|zTTTlbDlaa	You could use a dog trainer with another dog to help calm your's down. He might just want to play. But mine is other dog aggressive and will attack any size dog, although he is only 17 lbs. Don't know why, but he hates strange dogs around. HowEVER, I CAN train him to accept another dog and he will play with it...as long as it's no bigger than he is and is a docile, non aggressive dog. In his heart he really wants to play, but he does have this protection thing going on. It can be embarrassing when we're out for a walk.|`|AA10789032	A dog trainer would help.  enroll in obedience classes that focus on positive training methods. These classes benefit dogs at any age, and are an important step in socialization and developing a bond between dog and you.  Start socializing your older dog to other dogs by taking him to a place where he can watch other dogs from a distance without having to interact with them. As soon as another dog comes into sight, offer your dog a treat and continue to give him treats as long as the other dog is in view. If he barks and refuses the treat, stop and move further away. Just keep repeating this.  Try not to react and tug on the leash if your dog barks or growls at another dog. Most aggressive behavior towards other dogs has been unintentionally taught by owners who yell and pull on their dog's leash when they react negatively to another dog.    The link below is of great help
Lrr1gSFcaa	Dogs eat meat. People food is flour products. Dogs can have fruit and veggies. Mine does.|`|PM23RDycaa	High quality dry kibble or the raw diet are your best options. Canned is bad for the teeth and leftovers teach your dog to bed and are unhealthy in the long run.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	It order of being "best" and more natural for a dog:  1) Raw,  2) home cooked  3) canned  4) dry    Dry food does not keep teeth clean nor is it more nutritious despite claims. Canned food is very nutritious contains more meat & less carbs then dry and it doesn't casue tooth issues. Raw or homecooked is a natural diet and very well utilized by most dogs.|`|1a28ef0304d145d0c1edec369cd24d62aa	Dry food is the best and you can do it along with some canned.  Don't feed leftovers.  That can lead to your dog being overweight which in turn can lead to all sorts of problems.  Feed your dog dry twice a day and you can either mix a bit of canned in with the dry or not feed canned food at all.  Just make sure you are feeding portions that are not out of control because that can lead to being overweight also.  I do have to say though that a piece of something from the table every now and then won't hurt as long as your dogs stomach can handle it but it shouldn't be his/her meal and it shouldn't be large in quantity.  If you ever change the kind of dry food your dog gets just make sure you change it gradually by adding a little of the new food to the old at a time until you completely switch over.  Switching quickly can cause stomach upset and diarrhea.|`|16XpYCBmaa	Dry dog food would be the best out of which you asked. Once in a while a can of dog food is not going to hurt your dog but mix that in with his dry food so he don't get diarrhea from it. I also give my dog human food to, I try not to but it is so hard when she looks at me with a cute little face and wines.|`|IMwMqko1aa	use dry food. if you use leftovers your dog will just sit and beg for more while you are eating and some of the food we eat is bad for dogs.  also if you use canned food the dog can choke if you don't cut it up enough.|`|AA12268104	None of the above. The honest kitchen dog food is awsome. I have been using it for about 1 year now and have nothing but good results|`|cb78fa08ad18ad003be3857b05d920d3aa	to reduce dirrhea, mix the dry food in with some of the soft food.    dont feed them ppl food, because it is very bad for their health, and that ALSO can cause problems to the dog, including diarrhea.|`|giOALKN3aa	I am a Vet Tech in New Mexico, and to tell you the truth, none of them are any better then one another. Both myself and me boss (which is the Vet of the practice) feed our dogs dry food mixed with canned, and you can give them leftovers as well. We feed dogs that are in the clinic chicken noodle soup, lunch meat, cheese, ice cream, yes believe it or not, if your dog is underweight give him ice cream...it has lots of calories and help.  Promise  I can guarantee that your dog will get diarrhea if they have not ever had canned, dry or people food, but its ok..they will get used to it. Also if your dog gets diarrhea on certain types of food then he may be allergic- so just be careful.  good luck hun|`|PAHDeIGpaa	You could mix wet food with dry if youd like to spice it up a bit for your dog every now and then. Leftovers are fine too, but you should keep in mind whats human food (fruit roll ups, fried chicken, hamburgers- none of these if you want him/her to be healthy!) and whats just plain raw food fit for any species (fruits and veggies, meats, etc) which im sure your dog would probably love! i think in the end its up to you and how you feed your dog and what you have to offer him|`|dAeD76F8aa	Don't feed him at all. let him tough it out and find his own food like i do.

I am the same way with my dog I actually make my mom mad sometimes because I act like she is the best dog in the world and I buy her a lot of stuff.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	If every dog were treated that well we wouldn't need anybody to go round up abusers!  I agree with you though, I think the dog is a little spoiled personally.  lol|`|s9haCi64aa	I think its great you love your dog so much but remember spoiling them can lead to bad habits! Dogs are happy when they have a leader, food and exercise :)|`|i6hl6JPMaa	Sounds like he getting really well looked after, which is great, it doesnt matter if he spoiled, he loves it all,|`|AuGE08Rjaa	yea sounds like a really happy dog tbh|`|gvtOLAPIaa	your dog sounds very well taken care of, i dont see how you'd get the impression he was not?   some owners barely take their dogs out walking at all. once a day is very good (:|`|mlKPPul9aa	What is spoiled?  Does he have behavioral problems, is he a pain to have in same room?  I think a dogs behavior is a large indication of whether or not one is spoiled.  Just my opinion|`|XCZH9xTFaa	of course u do he is a pampered dog|`|Sly02Odwaa	no dog can be spoiled to much but you do treat him well|`|oyvASkLLaa	i think if you did not carrie it so much then it would not be as spoiled|`|5UQiaSq1aa	you treat him perfect. Just how any human would be treated is how you should treat a dog, or any living animal, or thing. Your dog has a good life, and you are a responsible owner who obliously cares for their dog, and give him lots of love. I treat my dog the same way... They both are part of the doggy good life:-)
JTydxUFhaa	It's hard to answer without seeing the nest, as I'm not sure as to how it could be so small that it could be a danger. Also some breeds of chicken seem to be generally better at being mothers than others. If it helps, from my experience owning hens, they should be absolutely fine.    I don't think that the other chickens would attack the chicks, in my experience this has never happened. I'm sure that the chick will be better off in the warmth, familiarity and shelter of his nest than in a box in your room, especially if you don't have a heat lamp etc.    They should be absolutely fine :)|`|56a41ca27eb71a2f39232dc97097d9dbaa	No no, let the mother/clocker have them hatch naturally, she'll sort it just fine.  She will clean up and keep them warm herself (they stay under her) don't take them away, u can put a little chick crumb in for them but don't expect all 11 to hatch.  Good luck.|`|rQlzfHqraa	No. Let the hen take care of them. If the fence is big enough she will be able to protect them. Big enough would be at least 2 square yards per adult chicken.|`|6KxBqnstaa	No let the hens look after the chicks do not touch them or interfere. They know what to do.
	Yes, breed does make a difference. Smaller breeds tent to outlive bigger breeds. Great danes only live an average of 8 years because of their joints. I'd say that most dogs tend to get to 12 years old (or more!) if they have great vet care.     If you buy a dog from a pet store who gets their dogs from puppy mills, that dog might not live as long due to poor health and genetics. If you want a healthy dog, find a real breeder who shows their dogs and takes good care of them.|`|	I've had a 14 year old boxer/lab mix  I've had a 8 year old sheep dog     The breed makes a difference, the smaller the breed, the longer it lives. My sheep dog was HUMONGOUS! and only lived to 8 years|`|	Maximum age varies by breed & what you feed your dog.  Most commercial dog-food is high in cereal/corn.  But 10 years is a minimum & 15 a maximum age.|`|	The largest dog I had was a 13year old german sheperd that was 85lbs when she passed and the smallest was a 16yr old pekingese that was 7lbs.The sheperd lived a long life for being a large breed|`|	The average life expectancy of a dog is 12.8 years (according to this article).      This includes the longer average for small dogs like a toy poodle who can live for close to 15 years, and the lesser life expectancy average of a bulldog that is close to 7 years.  Usually, the larger the dog, the lesser the years.    I was real fortunate with my German Shepherd.  He lived for 13 years, about 3 years longer than the breeds' average life expectancy.      Do keep in mind, the years are just averages.  The quality of life you provide your dog with exercise, food and overall health/vet care can add years to the average.      This link here provides averages for the most popular breeds.    http://www.pets.ca/pettips/tips-46.htm|`|	About 15 years old.    Breed makes a difference most definately, but I have my first "small" breed currently (Shetland Sheepdog)--the rest were larger, so I have no comparison personally.
nIskOkn2aa	Have you shown models before?    If not, be sure to take your most perfect models.  Even the tiniest flaw will put you out of the running.    For a winter scene, I'm thinking you want to show in a performance class?  If so, I'd try a harness class with a sleigh, or maybe a horse pulling someone on skis.  You could set the scene with a very small pine tree (model) and some very, very fine snow - glue it to a base; don't just sprinkle it around.  Remember to keep it in scale!    Alternatively, you could do a Christmas scene, either with some of the Xmas models or dress your own.  Perhaps a horse pulling the Xmas tree home through the snow?      Or an enactment of Robert Frost's "Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening" - print out the poem, and have the horse and buggy/sleigh by some woods.    Have fun.|`|AA10986942	Model horse??? you mean the plastic ones that dont eat or poop??? Do you really show those guys?  guess its not hard to haul them to the shows, train them or bath them.... lol
XsBIITFvaa	there's no way to make a new day faster, unless you have a golden apple or use aging points. I know it's boring right now with your foal, but keep at it. Once you get to start riding it and competitions, it gets funner, so keep at it.     And to put your howrse to sleep, then click on "put my horse to bed" and you have to choose the box (stall) or pasture. If you put your howrse in the meadow, then he will have low health, energy, and moral. You can't keep them in the meadow without this happening until you have a blanket. You will find one in you box eventually. Everyday, put your howrse in the box for at least an hour and you will find all kinds of stuff, but not every time. You will find things such as tubs of grease (this gives your horse more speed), blanket (allows your horse to sleep in meadow without losing health, energy, or moral points) saddle cloth (this is a saddle pad. it gives you some kind of points) and that's all I can really remember.    Things to know about howrse:  **if you horse has less than 20% energy, then he will not completely recover the next day.  **if you horse has less than 5% energy, he could die  **don't feed your horwrse or give him treats until after you work him, because this will boost his energy  **keep your howrse in a boarding stable, or else he will have "low spirits" meaning his moral and energy will be low    everything else you just really have to figure out on your own. have fun!!    my username is horseplay_09. my howrses are Royal Renegade and Twilight's Dream.|`|at7LXbEfaa	You click the button that says   put my mare/horse to sleep  you then have options to put it in a barn or a paddock  all my horses are in a barn    my user is pureblood      edit.  Once all your horses are asleep you may log off.  They picture wont change of your horse at all unless u get a golden apple.  Just log off and wait till it starts a new day
oVwGit7qaa	He probably is just very tired and does not feel like drinking water. Especially if you got him today. He may not be thirsty. He will drink it if he is thirsty.Talk to the vet if he doesn't drink any water in the next few days. I may suggest also, that if after he has a lot of exercise and is panting and for the rest of the day won't drink water, you may want to take him to the vet.|`|QjoWA99Yaa	Try puppy milk (not cow's milk). It tastes nicer than water. You can buy cartons of it in shops.|`|8n7jLHfxaa	sry to break it to ya but just to let u know when i was in 2nd grade i learned when ur dogs nose is dry its gonna die..........FORCE HIM jk worst thing u can do.......go to a vet and if u dont have time just call them and tell them the story|`|3LAF3XCFaa	Try putting puppy formula in the water and see if he drinks it, I would also call and talk to a vet as soon as you can.|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	leave his nose alone lol ppl tend to think that puppy's nose is a thermometer hell drink when hes comfy|`|AA10500537	it;ll drink when it gets thirsty dont force it inro anything|`|SxQvaW28aa	A dogs nose being dry has NOTHING to do with there health.bu if he won't drink his water try puting some flavoring....Like a teaspoon of amond oil might help but not to much ;) good luck with your new puppy! He probably wont drink cause he misses his litermates (give him time)|`|oXKwSkgsaa	Sorry but I think your dog might die so take the dog to a vet ASAP|`|E6dYd2Ulaa	my husky puppy did the same thing she just licks her nose dry its nothing really and he is probably not thirsty
szyUVMOlaa	Bless you that is a wonderful thing you did. But you know you can't take them home! In such a built up area as Cancun I imagine there will be an animal protection society like the RSPCA. Just have a look round on the internet and see what you can find or ask someone local who might know. The animal protection service will take them in and look after them and hopefully get them rehomed. Good luck.|`|tmckNa4baa	Ask someone u trust what u should do, and maybe if u really want the kitties u can probably buy them or sign something saying u can keep them. Its a sad sight to see them abandoned by a mother or someone else who's a mean owner :( I really wish u best of luck and hoping that in some way u can keep the kitties! :P :D =D I think u should probably tell a vet or someone else about it and in some way ask if u can keep them but i think something has to be arranged first before that happens, Hope u the best and hope the kitties the best too! :P :D God bless u and the cute wittle kitties! Good luck!|`|54UnlRQnaa	you could keep them and take care of them (but it costs money to bring cats on plane because they are use to the hot and if they go in the bottom part of the plane they'll be cold).|`|b7TxmlAnaa	Listen carfully, I want you to take one of those kittens and train it to dance so it can be a star and the other can be a toilet plunger (trust me fluffy works great on the tubes!)
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	We have that happen a lot (or strays that wander by...just stick around).  Some of them we've absorbed into our family; others we rehabilitate and heal up (thankfully, our cat/dog vet will give us MASSIVE discounts when we bring in strays or 'drop-offs'.  It makes taking care of them possible) before trying to find homes for them.  We also have stops along the way into town (we live on 10 acres in the boonies) where we drop off bags of dogfood/catfood for strays we've seen.  It's not much, but it's what we can do.|`|05805cd7f8ba800b6b1e4c9525a624bcaa	I take care of them. I had a box set at my door not too long ago with 2 puppies one completely crippled in her back legs and their mom dead in the box. I bought some puppy milk and hand fed them until my vet felt it was ok to take them off. Then I housebroke them and found them homes. A few I have kept.    I have had mostly dogs but also cats, lizards, turtles, ferrets, snakes, guinea pigs, rabbits, fish (yes fish) even a donkey once set down in my yard. I take them to the vet as soon as I can if they are unwell I nurse them back to health and find them homes not one has ever had to go to the pound.    I will never deny an animal care just because some irresponsible 'person' feels they can just set an animal down to throw it in the shelter.    And I usually have about 10lbs of dog and cat food and a few doghouses sitting outside for strays I don't see to eat.|`|edMjOs5saa	Usually call the humane society and drop them there if I cannot care for them myself.
LNnP3oAgaa	Dont do a water change while you are treating the fish, leave it until you have finished the treatement.  It wont hurt them not having a water change for a while.  Not sure if you realise this, but the only media you should have taken out (if you have it in your filter) is the carbon.  Not everbody uses it in their filters so if you dont use it in yours then dont worry about part of it.  Carbon will stop the medicine from working.  The rest of the media in your filter will be fine and they can carry on keeping the tank clean for you.  You can replace the carbon if you use it straight after finishing the course of treatment.You can also turn the thermostat up a very small amount aswell as this will speed up the life cycle of the white spot and should cure the fish.  White spot is always present in the tank whether your fish have it or not.  Its not always possible to cure fish of their little ailments so do be prepared incase they dont pull through.|`|qcAGW1ODaa	well all yu need to do is love and care for your little fishy!! he/she needs to keep havin their treatment and they should get better!! make sure yu give them fresh water quite regularly and just love and care for your fish... i wish yu and your fishy the best of luck xx|`|IrdZKYT3aa	The filter needs to be removed b/c the carbon in it will pull the meds from the water.  Taking it out allows the meds to diffuse and treat the fish.    So you treated the tank, is the ich gone?  If so I'd do a good water change and replace the filter.    If not, I'd do a water change, and re dose the fish. If you still have ich, try adding some aquarium salt and up the temp to 80-82 degrees .  Both will help with killing the fungus.  B/c the filter is out you'll have to monitor the water qualitycloselyy as ammonia is goin to start building up and stressing the fish out.  I'd probably dose the tank with aquarium salt and up the temp even if it's gone, just for a day or so as it can help relieve stress and makes the water less hospitable for bacteria, fungi, parasites and viruses.  Best of Luck!|`|g1MZWqEPaa	you should have an expert do it and im not one. or take them to a vet.|`|AA12310378	You should leave the filter media in place but remove any carbon from the filter.  This may require cutting it out of a cartridge. If you have thrown out the media you need put in new media, without carbon and start doing daily 30% water changes as if cycling from scratch.  Add new treatments every third day.  Extra aeration won't go amiss.|`|AraBfesHaa	If the instructions don't say to do a water change in between treatments, don't do it.  Follow the directions just as they are stated, then do the water change at the end.  Do you have an air bubbler in the tank?  Maybe they need oxygen, and the higher the temperature, if you up it for a day or more, will deplete the oxygen so you should have one.  If the carbon cartridge is over 2 weeks old, it is supposed to be ineffective so you can keep it in the filter if you want.  Aquarium salt will also help, but make sure all your fish can tolerate it before you use it in the tank.  I'm pretty sure they all can but don't know about the loaches.  Maybe someone else can answer that question. A majority of the fish can benefit from the salt, a few it will kill.  If you're positive it's ich and you're treating it as such, they should all be allright.
krqfJViEaa	Its best to get it from a good breeder as the breeder spends quality time with the hamster causing it to be more tame and will be more comfortable with human contact.   (Some pet shops get their hamsters from constant breeding just for the money. They dont pay much attention if the hamster is sick or ill. )    So if you get it from a pet shop, look for signs of sickness if you want to bring home a healthy hamster!    Hope I helped and good luck! :)|`|ReGhCqgVaa	I think either way it would be alright as long as it's a good breeder.    I've always gotten my hamsters from pet stores (mostly Petsmart) and they've always been great =]|`|07qFHL6iaa	it doesn't really make a difference. But don't get a petco one, they are aggressive. Get your pets from stores that aren't chain.   I got my hamster from a small pet store. He's adorable and he's healthy.  But on the petco website there are pages on how to take care of your pets... read that before you do ANYTHING!|`|s1fs5mjCaa	Well maybe go to a pet shop near you and ask if you can hold it and play with it in a little
XF1ctbrkaa	Yes..   I have one that is 4 feet long (so they can get bigger than 3 ft)..  and one that is just over 3 feet..    one is as thick as a can of Pam (cooking spray).. that one was over fed by the previous owner..  they aren't giants, they are easily handled by anyone.. (my friends six year old daughter handles both of mine all the time)      I'd highly recommend them..  due to the addictive nature of these snakes there are now MANY colors and patterns to  choose from.. (and cost varies by rarity.. )   They are not aggressive.. most bites are from improper feeding techniques (not using feeding tongs) .. even when they do bite it does not hurt, so that's always good.    They tend to have few feeding issues.. (unless you intend to breed.. I've heard many people with newly hatched snakes that don't want to eat)  They don't need a lot in the way of heat.. (low in the 70's high in the 80's)  UV is not necessary for most morphs as they are not baskers... they tend to stay in the shade..    Don't need more than a 40 gallon for an adult .. (and even that isn't necessary.. my 4 ft.  was fine in his 20 gallon.. I just liked having more room for hides and plants so put him in a 55 gallon)|`|nbGf6udUaa	yes.. about 3 feet max|`|ZEDxoOa1aa	Yes corn snakes do make great beginner pet snakes. They do get up to 4 to 5 feet rarely at 6 feet . I do in fact own a big female corn snake that is at 52 inches long. hope this helps.
UictPrl5aa	1st your cage is probably big enough, you didnt say how much of that was actuall cage and not stand, but it seems fine. besides you should let them out for a few hours, 3-4 week minimum.     It is easier to train one and get it to love you, afterall you would be the only friend it had. You probably wont get them to talk if you have more than one.     That being said you can train two.     If you got them from a pet store where they are only around other budgie's it will take a while, i got two from a pet store at the same time, they were very scared for a while and wouldnt even sit on my finger for a few weeks, but they get used to you. Mine will now sit on my finger/shoulder/arm, eat from my hand, one still doesnt like to be held in my hand but he doesnt bite anymore. One will even sing to me if i make noises at him. I have had them for 6-7 monthes.    It is probably a good idea to put the new one in the other cage, put it right next to the other cage. The new one will be scared, but the old one will be very interested and make the new one feel better. You can probably put them in the same cage after a day or two.     as far as the stuff they eat you just have to put it in thier cage and see if they eat it. it will  take them some time before they start exploring things in thier cage so dont be discouraged.     just keep interacting with them over time they will get used to you.     PS like someone else said there is a good chance they will be much louder with two of them. especially if they get seperated, they will chirp loudly alot.     all in all, they are flock birds, they like having company, it will just take more work from you to get them both to love you.|`|s3tY5YzIaa	Well, it is very hard to keep two budgies tamed. I have done it in the past, but it was very painstaking. I also dont think you should be selfish in this situation. You SHOULD buy him another friend, but put him/her in the cage with the one you already have. I find it cruel to keep single budgies.    Also, before even ever letting the new budgies come in contact, keep the new bird in a different bird safe room, quarentine him for at LEAST 14 days. Keep an eye out for illnesses, and take him to the vet to insure health. remember, the 20 dollars you pay for that budgie is NOT the only cost.     I think it is cruel to have pets that dont ever get vet check ups.  Please do not get a budgie unless you have enough money for vet bills, feed, DAILY fruits and veggies, and new toys and perches at least monthly    and if you get a second bird be sure to clean the cage at least once a day. and change the water twice a day.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	1) Yes you should get another one. I'm not sure if the new one would like you but the old one will still do. You cannot leave your budgie alone when you are not at home just because you want him to be attached to you right? Your plan for training the new budgie is great, but it is quite difficult to train an adult budgie...    2) Yes it is but it would be rather squeezy and he might not like it. If there are two, then definetly no.    3) If they don't get along well, then put the new bird in the small cage and place their cages side by side. observe them and try putting them back after a week. If everything is fine, then leave it there. If they get along well from the beggining, then there is no need to do the steps above.    4) Try to show him that it is nice, and sometimes, you should take his seeds out and put the fruits or vegetables there during his meal times.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	hi i had the same problem i had two birds and then one died and my other one was talking to the birds outside and my finch's i have two and so i thought about it and i got a new one billabong that's the one in my picture and my old two are roxie and angel and now billabong and roxie are great friends and they are not lonely any more so i think that you should get another one to make your bird happy|`|WDfWklRUaa	once you get another bird your bird will change complety. will not talk and will be more intetrested in the other bird than you also two are very noisey
qEp9fxU9aa	Small insects near the surface.  Lots of mosquito larvae, infusoria around floating plants and near the shore line or driftwood, etc.|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	They don't call them mosquito fish for nothing.

Basically the same as any tropical fish.|`|AA11708471	Mosquito larvae (frozen/live/freeze dried bloodworms will be a fine substitute)  and   flake food|`|t85b6QMiaa	This gluttonous fish is very easy to satisfied.

X2TnitFwaa	Is it spayed? It could be just marking it's territory.    If she is, watch her carefully. When it looks like she's about to do it, quickly grab her and put her in her litter box.    If she just poops, put a glove on or use a napkin or something, and pick it up, and put it in her litter box to reinforce the message.    Remember, be patient.

NaPibFiYaa	I'm sorry, your hamster probably does have a tumor. :(  My best friend had this adorable hamster who got this soft, penny-sized lump on his head. He acted normal and everything a few weeks before he died a couple months later.   Don't be too sad, your hamster is old and he's lived a good life. If you were a caring, loving owner, you have nothing to be ashamed of. No one can control who gets a tumor.   Good luck!|`|DaweNIOCaa	get a butter knife and cut that sucker off|`|AA10452263	Examine the lump very closely. If you use wood chip bedding, it's possible that he's just got himself a splinter. This could cause the area with the splinter to become infected. Especially if you use cedar.|`|PEvWgIkVaa	Its Probably A cancer, (I had a Rodent and it got a Tumor and sadly passed away a week later.)    Get it to the vet to Examine it and see if its a cancerous Tumor.    and 3 years old?, im sorry. Syrain hamsters usually only live till 3.   :( (I had one before,....)    Take it to the vet,  and spend as much time as Possible with him before it may end him...sorry about your hamster D:|`|nmzpdvkqaa	if hes going to die put him out of his misery.|`|lOp2gVxJaa	If your not going to take him to the vet then there's no point in asking us.|`|vwGSTzHYaa	Since he is old for a hamster, it could be.    But just be prepared, he may go to heaven soon.    But there is no point to go to the vets, your moms bf is right.|`|0vDLCa24aa	Maybe your hamster is just doing a very weird stance. Hamsters love to do weird things alot ^^
FFbWgs0Xaa	You are right that eating things from outside is how cats get toxoplasmosis so it is unlikely that an indoor at can get it.  Humans can also catch it from the dirt when gardening so wear gloves if you garden.      However it is still better that pregnant women avoid contact with litter boxes.  If there is nobody else to emplty and clean the box then you should wear an apron and gloves when dealing with it and wash you hands thoroughly afterwards (you probably already wash your hands afterwards).      Alot of cat owners have already had toxoplasmosis without knowing and so have an immunity; a blood test can confirm this.      I honestly don't think you have to worry given that you cat doesn't go outside; you definately shouldn't get rid of the cat.|`|wRaBVoszaa	I would just watch for signs/symptoms.  It's probably a little hasty to assume you have it--but just in case, maybe you should mention it on your next doctor visit.  See what his advice is.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	best thing to do is to ask your ob/gyn or doctor.    From experience with friends, it's not an issue with an indoor cat as it's usually in kittens and you may have already been exposed to it (as in years ago) so don't worry.  Good hygiene is really the key|`|xgKQrEhqaa	This is what I read, but I would definitely talk to your doctor.  The problem with toxoplamosis is coming into contact with the disease for the first time while in the early stages of the pregnancy.  Key here is for the first time.  If your cat has it and has had it prior to your pregnancy you have already come into contact with it and it will not be a problem.  If your cat has had contact with something after you got pregnant, then that increases your risk if you haven't had exposure elsewhere.  Having said that having a baby is nothing to take any risks with.  I would have someone else change the litter box and talk to your doctor.|`|rzf4tMXGaa	You shouldn't really change the litter box when pregnant, but hopefully you've washed your hands after.  I'm 18 weeks pregnant, and i also worried about this, but honestly, i think if you did have that disease, you would already be immune to it.  You can always get a test to be on the safe side, but I think you are fine.|`|9G03aQhsaa	Talk to your OBGYN.  Also have your cat tested.  If the cat does have toxoplasmosis, in most cases it can be cured, so there is no need to give it up.  Check out the link from cornell for more details.      Best of luck to you!

CilhtOGGaa	Electric dog fences don't always work, especially with larger breed dogs. And they aren't always dependable for smaller dogs, especially if you lose electrical power. If the fence isn't used properly, the dog may get injured.  Instead, you should consider spending your money on behavior training.  You will have a happier more responsive, and well behaved dog as a result.    My neighbor installed an electric fence for his dog.  When the dog (Alaskan Husky) wanted to go out of the yard badly enough - like to chase after a squirrel - he'd take the electrical jolt and get out anyway.  He was always getting out of the yard.  He eventually got the dog trained and he quit taking off.     Behavior training is the best way to keep a dog from running off.  With the right training, daily exercise and supervision, your dog will quit leaving home.  Check with your local vet or animal shelter about reliable trainers in your area.|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Yes, thay do work!|`|tmckNa4baa	I'm sure it works cause my sister's friend used to have 2 horses and when they were out there grazing and running they had electric fences on to keep them from running away! :P :D|`|1whPPwXyaa	I have one and I am not impressed with it.

nPuZVGFRaa	I have 1 guinea pig now.  My opinion would be just to probably either just keep the one you have and not get another one.  Or you could get a smaller cage and put it next to the other one.  You know... Let them kinda get used to each other?   Then sorta start putting him in the cage and see what they do.  And if they don't get along then I would recommend taking the one back to the pet store.  Or you could keep him trapped in the tiny cage forever.   Ha ha.  Good Luck!  SammyC(=|`|0vDLCa24aa	YES! Guinea Pigs LOVE company the more Guinea Pigs the Better, as long as they are the same gender they'll be more then just happy ^^|`|CXOqnMM9aa	That's hard to answer.  You should know him (assuming it's a male) and see if he's aggressive, or playful, or shy towards humans, there's a good chance he might react to the new guinea pig the same way he does to you.  I don't reccomend getting a girl unless you want guinea pig babies.  However, get a young, about 3 months old male, which is still young, so they shouldn't fight much, as they're pretty social.  If you treat them equally, there should be no problem.|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	You should get another one as guinea pigs are social creatures and like comapny of their own kind.  They don't get jeleous.      Care does need to be taken when introducing a new guinea pig, especially as you current one is male.      Generally the younger the new guinea pig the better as a baby will be seen as much less of a threat.      It can be easier to introduce a female but then one of the two will need neutering and this carries (small) risks and will cost (but not much).  But two males can get on just fine if you do not want to neuter.      It is best to have a spare enclosure at first and not house them together immediately.  Just allow them some time together on neutral territory (try the empty bath tub) each day untill they seem to be getting on.  Some innitial violence and even humping is normal but only separate them if blood is drawn (it happened the fist time my two saw each other but once the wound healed and they met again they were okay with each other).  It can help to provide favourite foods at meetimg times to keep them busy.  Once they are getting on they can move in together.  Before you put them together give the cage the best clean it has ever had (to remove all scent) and if you can re-arrange it a bit.  This is to make it seem less like the first guinea pig's territory.  If they still fight a little then prvice two of everything (sleeping areas, food, wtaer) so there is less to fight about.      It might sound complicated but it is worth it and guinea pigs are very docile so it is rarely difficult to make sucessful introductions.  I was able to haouse my two adult males together within a week and they now act like brothers.|`|IuyO9Vq2aa	Lol, they don't get jealous like dogs or cats. Especially cats. Guinea pigs love company and they won't kill each other. Don't worry =) One time i got a kitten and i already had a 4 year old cat. My cat would stalk the kitten and they would play way too rough. But it's all good now =) They're freinds
nFcl0BOsaa	Bring her inside. Why is she outside -- not housebroken? Housetrain her all over again, just like you would a puppy.  Additionally, do some research on the handling and training of this breed:      "This breed responds to motivational training. They have a fine sense of hearing, and make good watch dogs..Sadly this little dog often falls into Small Dog Syndrome, a human induced behavior, where the dog thinks he is pack leader to humans. This causes many varying degrees of negative behaviors to come out in the dog...They will become willful with a loud persistent bark, as they try and get THEIR humans to listen to them. They will become nervous and untrustworthy with strangers and children, and inclined to fight with other dogs. Often times they will develop separation anxiety, getting very upset when left alone. Followers are not allowed to leave the pack leader, however pack leaders can leave the followers. They can become can snappish if surprised or peeved, and begin to display guarding behaviors. These negative behaviors are NOT traits of the Lhasa Apso, they are human induced behaviors, resulting from the dog not being treated like the canine species it is. Lack of leadership, rules and the lack of limits placed on the dog. A mentally stable dog, who gets enough mental and physical exercise will have a totally different personality. It is all up to the humans around the dog. As soon as the humans start being true pack leaders, the dogs behavior will change for the better.    Living Conditions  These dogs are good for apartment living. They are very active indoors and will do okay without a yard.    Exercise  Lhasa Apso need a daily walk.  Play will take care of a lot of their exercise needs, however, as with all breeds, play will not fulfill their primal instinct to walk. Dogs who do not get to go on daily walks are more likely to display behavior problems. They will also enjoy a good romp in a safe open area off lead, such as a large fenced in yard.    Life Expectancy  About 15 or more years. This breed is very long-lived. Some dogs live up to 18 or more years.  http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/lhasaapso.ht...|`|zzkmdusEaa	Get her a bark collar. Those dogs are a very obnoxious breed. Put on her bark collar when she goes outside and take it off when she is inside. If you have people that walk by your property or other dogs in neighbooring yards it will be very hard to keep her from barking. You just have to make her understand that you don't find barking as pleasurable as she does, if she is barking out of control bring her inside and scold her if you have to. She will eventually get the message.|`|tmckNa4baa	Understand the dog, why is she barking? Maybe if she doesnt stop get a dog whisperer to understand y she's barking way to much. Never give her away if she doesnt stop barking cause ik people who do that.

jZp6jY9Zaa	She sounds very fearful.  For some reason certain people or dogs look threatening to her and on her leash she may feel she needs to protect you.  You can try to find a trend in the type of dog or people your dog sees as threatening.  It may be dogs that are really hairy so they look really big, or it could be dogs that have upright ears because again they look very big and threatening.  It could also be people with hats, or funny scarves, or flowing clothing.  Once you know that you will be able to be prepared when it does happen.  You still may not catch it every time.     The way to stop the aggression is to remove something positive when she does this.  When you are on a walk the best thing to remove (especially for a fearful dog) is its owner.  If you can walk with a friend or family member.  When your dog goes after someone or their dog, you hand the leash to your friend who 'acts like a tree' being completely neutral, not talking or moving, and you go and hide (behind a car, tree, building, whatever) for 10 seconds.  Once your dog does her little growl and lunge you said she becomes fearful.  When she is afraid she relies on you for support, so when you leave you are removing something that at that time she feels she needs.  She will probably pick up pretty quickly that you may leave her if she acts that way so instead of being aggressive she may next time growl, but look at you quickly and not lunge.  If this happens, ask her to sit beside you and give her a treat for sitting.  She is now being praised for giving the appropriate response for seeing someone scary.  Basically whenever someone approaches you want your dog's eye contact so that you know you have control over her and so that she knows you are in charge.  In a way eye contact is like the dog either asking permission or checking in with you to make sure you see what is coming that she thinks may be a threat.  The behaviour may take a little while to shape into what you want, but make sure you are consistent and always expect less and less of a reaction from her towards the other dog/person and when it gets to an appropriate reaction divert her attention and praise her.    Good luck!|`|NeF4rUujaa	obedience school is the only thing i can think of.|`|bgKitk9paa	I don't know how old the dog is, but maybe she needs some training.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	I saw this show on T.V yesturday its long a dog nanny in england.

Otherwise, he's unique. He's a keeper for sure!|`|AA12168102	Sounds like he's just badly bred or a mix.  According to the breed standard a doxie should not have bat ears as you describe, they should have drop ears.  "The ears are set near the top of the head, not too far forward, of moderate length, rounded, not narrow, pointed, or folded. Their carriage, when animated, is with the forward edge just touching the cheek so that the ears frame the face."    Of course,  unless you were planning on showing him, it really doesn't matter, it just adds character!  :)  Just make sure you get him neutered so that he doesn't pass on a faulty trait.|`|ixFbNr4taa	Hi....    I hate to ask - where did you get Cooper??  Especially at 11 months.  Most Dachshunds have thick, heavy ears that might flap open if they are jumping or if they are looking straight up at you from very close to your feet.  but to have the long heavy ears flap open is slightly odd.    He might have what I call "bat ears" -- which are thin and a bit more leathery in appearance.  It's just a sign that his breeding might not be of the highest caliber but if he's a great little guy -- what's the diff??      Could he have some Chihuahua in him?  Lots of BYBers are crossing the breeds so you can get a dog that looks very much like 1 breed or the other with just a smig of Chi or Doxie to them.  And Chis have erect ear sets.......    GOOD LUCK with Cooper in any case.  Get him into an obedience class and maybe get an ILP/PAL number with the AKC and run some earthdog tests or agility with that Dachshund!!!!

uBFhKXgHaa	Excellent job switching to a higher quality cat food! Your cat will be much, much healthier for it. To answer your question on dry/wet, the answer is wet. Contrary to popular belief, wet/canned food is actually healthiest for cats.    The reason is, in the wild, cats normally get most of their water content directly from their prey items and drink very little. Domestic cats are no different, and because of the fact that they are designed to take in water with their meal, they have a very low thirst drive. Cats often just don't drink enough. This leads to urinary tract infections and crystals. The bit about dry food being better for teeth is a myth and has not been proven in the least (cats barely even chew their dry food and, really, does a pretzel clean /your/ teeth? Cats should have their teeth brushed with cat toothbrushes and cat toothpaste at least a few times a week as well as see the vet for dental cleanings when necessary /regardless/ of what they are being fed). Canned/wet food is better because it more closely mimics the cat's natural diet. More on why canned food is best:  http://www.catinfo.org/  (Excellent cat nutrition information by a vet)  http://cats.about.com/cs/catfood/a/canne... (Canned Cat Food: Can Your Cat Afford to Live Without it?)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Why Cats Need Canned Food)  http://www.felinefuture.com/nutrition/bp... (The Dry Food Crisis)  http://maxshouse.com/feline_nutrition.ht... (Max's House: Feline Nutrition)  http://www.littlebigcat.com/index.php?ac... (Does Dry Food Clean the Teeth?)    Another option to get cats to drink more would be a cat fountain. Cats tend to like to drink from running water and cat fountains see to that need, encouraging cats to take in more water.      Darksong~|`|8466ee3d8aec016c639737d732471435aa	I do both - I believe they need both (although some argue)  the crunch is good for the teeth and need to chew and the other puts fine things in them and a shiny coat.|`|JjMDvMJuaa	I mix both for my cats.  Because cats tend to not drink enough water, it is good to give them a small amount of wet food each day.  I use about a spoonful pet cat a day mixed with the dry food.|`|8tdlP1rOaa	My cats have dry food available to them all day.   One of my cats is particular picky, so she only gets wet food sometimes (when she really bugs me...even then, she sometimes wont eat it...)  but my other cat gets wet food in the morning and at night.|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	I give both because they like the variety but more importantly dry is good for the teeth and wet helps to keep them hydrated.  Mine have sensitive stomachs so I feed more dry than wet but if they didn't I would give half and half.  I feed dry in the morning and dry and wet in the evening (separate bowl for each).|`|m4Jc4o9naa	my cat gets dry food for lunch and breakfast and wet food for dinner it helps her sleep better and its easy to digest! hope this helps!|`|fdGITZ7daa	My cats get wet food for their main meals (breakfast and dinner) and dry crunchies for a midday snack. They clearly dislike eating only one variety, since we gave them only dry food for a few days (which they seemed to like more), and they stopped eating it and begged in front of the cupboard with the wet food cans. Anyway, I advise using both!|`|Y3Ok8h5taa	science diet is a good brand, personally i feed my cat mostly dry food mainly because it helps to keep her teeth clean. its fine to switch it up between wet and dry as long as you stick to the same formulas. obviously if your cat has any special conditions, you should choose the formula accordingly. if you decide that you want to change the formula(s) the change has to be gradual, where you mix the two together by slowly phasing out the old food and phasing in the new. hope that helps a little, good luck w/ the kitty!|`|85XV1229aa	Hello, this is actually a complex question and I hope this is the best answer! I give my 6 month old kitten wet and dry food. His dry food bowl is always filled and he gets 1/2 of a normal size can of wet in the morning (6:00AM) and evening (6:00PM). He gets Friskies wet and Kit N' Kaboodle dry.    Many vets recommend dry food because it has nutritional values and helps teeth. They say wet food gives them no vitamins and has no benefit. My grandmother always gave her cat dry and wet food and he lived to be 19 years old. My vet said he gives his cats only dry food and they are 20 and 22 years old. Either way, as long as you get your cat in for regular check-ups, he or she will be healthy.     For extra nutrition and to get vitamins and minerals, every morning I crush up a cat vitamin pill in Ashton's food. He responds to this very well and actually likes them. It gives him the extra boost of health he needs as a kitten and will when he is an adult.     He gets 1/2 of a normal can of food twice daily. Some people only give 1/2 of a small can (I did when Ashton was a kitten) or 1 whole can per serving. I think those are both too little and too much. Ashton eats his wet food right away, and when he gets hungry later, he eats the dry food. This way, he gets a balance of both foods.    Don't forget about treats! I have a large container full of a variety of treats for Ashton and give him about 4-8 per day, depending on if he is good or not. Another good thing to give them after they eat is Pit-R-Pat breath freshening treats. I give Ashton one after he eats every morning and night.    For his water, Ashton has a trickling fountain that is always running. Cats do not drink much water when it is in the bowl. I have noticed since he has had this that he drinks much more, which is very healthy for him.    Good luck with your cat and always feed him or her what you think is right!

cXK9sY1raa	Trailing poop suggests your fish is constipated. What're you feeding him? A diet of just flakes can cause this. It's a good idea to soak food before u feed it so that it doesn't swell up inside your fish. They only need a very light feed twice a day.    Try feeding your fish a pea, shelled. I drop a frozen pea in a mug of boiling water, leave it a minute, remove the outer shell, mush it a little and drop it in the tank. This should get things moving again.    It's also a good idea to fast your fish one day a week so that he doesn't get too bunged up.    Vary your fish's diet with bloodworm, brine shrimp, gel food, greens etc to keep his insides working smoothly, and they like the variety.|`|lvDam67Saa	Go to petsmart and i am hoping they will and or can help you but otherwise I am not sure.|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Sometimes over feeding will cause this, also how much activity does your fish get, is it alone ?|`|c4efe59d7156d703727cab1791d23180aa	Petsmart has small & large goldfish toilet paper that comes on a little tiny roll; I think you can get 6 rolls for like $2.99 or something and they hang on the edge of the tank.

FJHU9PbUaa	Probably just a matter of finding the right food for him, sometimes even the better brands will have something that don't agree with some dogs. Avoid CORN, it is a huge contributer to gas, and is in the cheaper made foods. You could try a food witht only one protein source (like fish) & see how he does on that or else try a grainless. Feed him smaller meals more often, as oppsed to heavy meals once a day, he won't be overly hungry & gulp up so much air as he eats.  www.dogfoodanalysis.com tells you about the different foods out there.

Some breeds are also just known to be flatulant.. expecially bully breeds like boxers and bulldogs.|`|6cEwF2Vraa	I would try Beneful, it works for my two pups. Just make sure you change dog food over slowly because this in itself can upset a dogs stomach. Hope this helps.|`|Um8osMNuaa	One of the causes of flatulence is poor quality food, as poor quality food is difficult to digest properly.You need to stick with one food for a while to give it chance, you seem to have tried lots of different brands in a short space of time. At 8 months old he really needs to be on junior, not adult or senior.  Also if your dog is greedy and gulps his food down he will also be swallowing lots of air with it, which comes back out as wind.  Feeding table scraps can also cause wind!.    You should try changing her food to a better quality brand.  Give small meals more often, this will slow down her eating too fast.  Don't feed any table scraps.  Feeding charcoal biscuits can help to reduce gas production in the stomach.    Although some dogs are just naturally windy and it's something you just have to learn to live with, although having said that it can also be a sign of a digestive disorder, so you should see the vet if it continues.|`|5Hmyjr7Eaa	Dont sweat it its a way of life

If I put my face close to my one cat ZJ, he'll push his face into my face and it's pretty cute, but makes me sneeze.|`|1ad7aa5Caa	He's claiming you by putting his scent on you. It's partly affection.|`|u1HahCoqaa	It's a sign of affection, or he just wants your attention. Although they also have marking glands on their cheeks, so he might be marking you as well.|`|SvzKyWGXaa	Heehee. It's a sign of affection.  Your cat loves you.  As well, he owns you now. He's marking you as his.  Rub him back.    Edit: he could also be trying to get you to do something. Pet him, maybe?  Or maybe his head is excessively itchy. Lol.  But most likely he just really likes you.  Be honoured.

KEYgd73saa	With Ich, even if they don't show it, it is very likely all the fish in the tank are at least mildly infected, just at the stage where the parasites are buried in the skin.  Fortunately, it doesn't sound anything like Ich.  Ich manifests as white spots about the size of a grain of salt-- not chalky areas.  This sounds more like early fungus or columnaris infections.  Since you haven't provided enough information to tell whether it's fungus or columnaris, I'd recommend you both read up on each disease AND describe the symptoms in further details.    If you don't feel comfortable making a diagnosis yourself or do not update us before the question closes, consider Fungus Clear, Fungus Eliminator, Furanase, Furan 2, or similar nitrofurazone-based medications, as they are effective against both columnaris and fungus.  Fungus is generally off-white and more fibrous, while columnaris will be very white mats.    Fungus: http://kissyourfish.com/images/fungushea...  http://www.cosmos.com.sg/images/fungus-b...

I used the ick medication on my fish even though some of them didnt have any problems.Everything worked out fine. There are many medicines out there that treat ick. I used jungle fever and got it at a pet smart store..  it worked really well and dont worry your other fish will be fine. Since you may suspect your others have ick you should just leave them all together. hope this helps and i wish you the best of luck. if youd like to email me im down :P :) mwa
fbGv4iZ1aa	Feed your dog cat food and your dog could get                     Meowitiesm....feed your cat dog food and you                    cat could get Barkesitis.  And man are they hard to cure!                                                 No really here is the reason why you don"t:           Dogs should never eat cat food.  If the dog got into the cat food here and there it''s ok.  But you can't feed your dog a formulated cat food on a regular basis.  Cat' s require a large amount of protein and the protein count in cat food is to high for a dogs system to main tain.  Therefor it goes really without saying that cat's can't have dog food as their primary meal because they will not get enough protein.            Hope that was helpful.|`|2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Different requirements.  Cats need taurine, higher percentages of protein and fat (these guys are obligate carnivores--meaning they rarely seek out vegetation--except for the occasional desire to yack up on their human's carpet), and less fiber/carbs.  Dogs need less protein (though it should still be the main ingredient) and a slightly higher amount of plant matter/carbs (they are carnivores but will seek out vegetation/fruits to eat).|`|9G03aQhsaa	Yes.  Dogs and cats have different nutritional needs.  For example, cats need taurine in their diet or they will go blind and eventually die.  Cat food is specially forumlated to inclue taurine.  Dogs have other requirements.  Always feed your pet the proper food.
UwplbhSsaa	As breed characteristics are only used as a general guideline, I would recommend that you assess each dog individually and see which one is the best for you. In my experience poms and jacks are very vocal, as well as yorks and chihuahuas but this does not mean that the crosses of these breeds will be. The best advice I can give you is assess both dogs, if they don't seem to be a good fit for your pack, keep looking. You want this to be a good/comfortable situation for all parties involved :)    Best of luck!|`|tPGxPDvBaa	All of those breeds are well known barkers & might be a lil too small to play with your other dogs. It depends completely on the individual dog not the breed or mix of breeds.|`|vPde97E2aa	Doesn't matter,a mutt is a mongrel.  None alike...all the same.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	dont get those! get a golden doodle! very cute puppy, here is the link to why you should get one!    http://images.google.com/imgres?imgurl=h...|`|qydcoAbFaa	Seems how you own a terrier, I would go with the pom-jack russell cross|`|nPuZVGFRaa	i would go with the pomeranian/jack russel they don't bark a whole lot and would get along better with the bigger dogs.   Good Luck!  SammyC(=|`|FewhKlx9aa	Either breed is going to be a barker as you have two with a terrier mix in them..As far as training would go I think your Pom-Jack would be easier|`|AA12168102	You'd have to visit the dogs and see which one has the best temperament suited for you.  Mixed breeds have mixed temperaments so you can't go by the breeds in the mix - you don't know which traits are going to be dominant.|`|mlKPPul9aa	Chihuahua is a yippee dog and so is the pomeranian.  Both crosses listed have the potential to be noisy.  With good training this can be fixed tho.  Good Luck|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	Fantastic choice going to rescue!    If I were you, I would probably go and meet each individual dog, and decide which one you like best out of that. =)    Good Luck!|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Decide when you are there.  No point making a decision & then getting there to discover you have a real dislike to the breed you chose.  Far better to go with an open mind & take a wander around.  When you think you've found the one then ask if you can take your other dogs along for an introduction, that way you get an idea of what they will be like at home together.Good luck.|`|R81gaaCtaa	The decision is yours. But don't get small breeds like the Chihuahua or shitzu because they are very small and nervous. I hear that they bite and bark a lot from being nervous.|`|wRaBVoszaa	I think probably the Pomeranian/Jack russell would be the best... In my experience Jack Russells don't bark quite as much and seem a little better behaved.  Pomeranians can be pretty yappy-but maybe as a mix it will be a little better.  I don't know about Yorkies, but Chihuahuas seem very yappy.  Not all are, but unless properly trained they can be sort of annoying.    Edit:  The Jack Russell mix would probably get along best with big dogs.  For example, in my training class the Chihuahua in there always bites my dog and is aggressive.  (My dog is much bigger)
KFXjRpnFaa	I have to agree with you. I used to share a horse and it did go wrong. We both wanted to ride at the weekends, or we'd want to take her to a show and the other person didn't want her to go, or we thought she should change feeds but they didnt want to... the list goes on.    its a hell of a lot better for it to be your own. Then its your own responsibility, no-one can tell you what you can and cant do with it.    Tell your parents it will probably end in arguements, and they will be dragged into it, because I asume they will be paying for it.    I hope I helped a little and good luck =]|`|RZPLec5Eaa	This is what you can do. Buy a horse. That's great for you. Then find someone that you can half-lease it to. Write up an agreement. Say things like:    *You are not allowed to ride without me being at the barn, unless I agree over the phone.  (This may not be good forever but it would be good for the first 2 weeks or so)    *You are not allowed to change my horses feeding.|`|KOX2J7uXaa	I do have to agree with you on the fact that sharing a horse with someone could end badly. Because it isn't just about splitting cost but time as well.     What if there is a local horse show and both people want to enter in the same classes? What if a group at the stable plans a trail ride, which person gets to go?     Then like you mentioned there is the cost of equipment. A saddle for example....will both parties take proper care to clean and care for it? Then if the agreement with the horse falls apart(which chances are it will.) how will the saddle be handled?     Yet another issue that you made a good point on is that two people will have their own opinions on things like training, supplies, and care of the horse. One person may want to use a whip and/or spurs while the other doesn't want the horse exposed to that. One person may feel that a certain feed/hay is best for the horse, while the other is strongly disagrees.    These are all things you should mention to your parents to consider. Respectfully tell them that although you understand they were hoping to reduce cost, there are a lot of hassles and problems that could result in a big financial....even perhaps legal battle!    Instead of the sharing arrangement what about the idea of leasing a horse?Your parents may go for that idea since it's usually on a monthly basis. I know you desperately want one of your own, but this way you can prove your responsible enough to your parents first, and often after leasing the horse the owner will give the option to buy.|`|at7LXbEfaa	Well if u dont want to share then tough luck. u cant get a horse bacuse your parents say so.  i just got my first horse and in a year would like to half lease him out. Il be doing exams in year 10-11-12 and even thing year and wont have that much time.|`|PztyXoWLaa	I definitely know how you feel. I have my own horse already, but my dad is still trying to get me to find a sharer. I don't want to either, because my horse is like my baby and I don't want someone else to use him. There are many disadvantages to sharing a horse:  -liability  -deciding on cost splitting  -arguments on what the horse needs  -equipment  -if one person does something to the horse or hurts it, it could be a problem  -you have to agree on all decisions  -arguments over who gets the horse when  -the horse will be confused  -arguments over showing the horse...etc  -bonding with the horse    I don't think your parents understand what owning a horse is about. Convince them that sharing is worse. To them, they might fear that you will lose interest or fail to make enough commitment. Make sure they know you can handle it, and help pay some bills.|`|motYSp5waa	ok well this is what happened to me ...   i got my horse dude and i bonded with him real fast and now he bucks off everyone but me so when u try and find a sharer your horse bucks them off every time! (LOL)    hope this helps   good luck   Mykkie|`|jZ7ImGbvaa	I must be old school,  but I've never heard of this "sharing" business with a horse.  A horse needs to feel an attachment to one special person.  Seems to me if you have 2 different people with two different ways of riding would be confusing to  your horse.  When I had my horse (AQHA  513894) way back when, I was your age,    we were the best of buds and very bonded.  No one rode him but me!   Best of luck with your parents,  I hope you can convince them it's not in the best interest of the horse or you!  You know,  I still miss my horse after all these years.|`|fffb4947f32e3d680137b43e06849e7baa	maybe they are just worried you wont have time to work it everyday? think about maybe owning the horse and having someone lease it like 2 or 3 days a week or something, that way its still your horse. idk.   just an idea. i know what you mean though!|`|JG7W0qvcaa	Hey,    I Know What You Mean     A First Horse Is Special    You Don't Want Someone To Come    Along And Screw It Up    You Want It To Be Yours And Special    .....................

(you should save for little extra things for your horse once you get it)    you should explain to your parents exactly what you explained here. ask them if they would want to share you with another person?? prove to them that you are willing and able to take on the responsibilities of owning a horse..... are you? also, would competing be something that you would like to do later? because that would be tough to do with another person... you could mention that to your parents as well. not to mention, owning a horse with another person is tough on the horse. it has to get used to two different owners and riders... that could be mentally and physically tough on a horse.    not to mention, i personally think that sharing a first time horse is a very RISKY thing to do with another person. especially since it is a first time horse, chances are it is for the other person. i would try to stay away from that if i were your parents because they are looking at a lot of conflicts, disagreements, and possible arguments ahead. you might think you know the person well, and it could turn out that things change once you get the horse. also, if you dont know the person well, that is risky too. this could ruin a friendship. there could be jealousy, conflict of schedules, etc. god forbid if something happened to the horse, that could be very challenging too because im sure that both of you would probably have different opinions on how to handle the situation.... i would advise telling your parents all of this as well.     you should maybe consider asking them if you could start out owning a horse and if it doesn't work.... perhaps because you dont have enough time, money, etc. you could offer him to be leased or half-leased. also, you should find out why it is that they want you to share with somebody else and find out an argument against that.    best of luck and i completely agree with you! a first horse is a VERY special thing and it would kinda really be a bummer to have to share it with somebody else.... it should be your memories!|`|NJdupXBKaa	I understand you not wanting to have a sharer. Its really hard trying to build a bond with a horse when there is more than one rider in the picture.  I had a sharer on my pony Lucy until recently and it was horrible. She would never go up on her days and would always expect me to sort her out. Would never muck out properly or scrub buckets. Never feed enough water or hay. Its hard to find someone reliable enough to keep to a horse they are sharing. Maybe you could explain this to your parents.  Lucky for you money isn't a problem ;) Wish I was that lucky ha ha. But maybe if you made a contribution it would be more appealing for your parents.   It may be worrying your parents because a horse takes up allot of time and your GCSE's are going on. (Mine are too).  Its hard to fit it in around your horse. If you can find a way that if for whatever reason you couldn't make it to the yard then the horse would still be cared for. By a friend maybe. My best mates have to do my pony loads :P.    Hope this helps. And good luck. :)     P.S You dont sound spoiled to me. Some people are just bitter LoL.  xxx
pvgwJwxvaa	go back to the vet.    did they run a fecal test on her?  did they prescribe any medication?  numerous things can cause bloody diarrhea: parasites, bacterial over growth, ibd, tumor, etc.    how old is your dog?  what kind of food is she on?    add- my guess would be that your dog either has a food intolerance (similar to an allergy) because purina is garbage food with poor quality proteins and fillers such as corn, sibo (small intestinal bacterial overgrowth), or ibd (inflammatory bowel disease).  you could try putting your dog on a hypoallergenic food for at least 8 weeks to see if it helps, but i would take my dog back to the vet or to an internal medicine specialist.    hypoallergenic foods do not contain any corn, wheat, soy, chicken, beef, turkey, lamb, or fish. (think duck, venison, rabbit, bison, etc.)-  wellness and natural balance make hypoallergenic diets.    have your vet run a gi panel on your dog (tli, pli, b12, and folate).  your dog should be fasted for at least 12 hours prior to this test.|`|KxjUim7yaa	Vets are better than a website. You could try a different vet.|`|L22hVXTIaa	First I would find another vet that is a little more responsive to your dog's problem.  But, I can tell you that I had the same problem with one of my Chis when she was very young.  I had to go to 3 different vets before I found one that could actually do something about it.  She had ongoing bloody diarrhea, but other than that, did not appear sick.  She seemed playful and alert, but the bloody diarrhea persisted.  The 3rd vet put her on Flagyl, a broad spectrum antibiotic, and I fed her a prescription canned dog food that I bought from the vet with strict orders to give her one tablespoon full every 4 hours for two days, then gradually increase the amount and extend the time between feedings until she was receiving slightly less than 1/4 cup twice a day.  That did the trick!  She was doing better almost immediately and was back to normal in about a week.  Btw, other vets had run every test in the book and could find nothing wrong with her.  In total I spent around $1,500.  I'm sorry, but I don't remember the name of the prescription food, but perhaps another vet could recommend one.  I now feed all my dogs Wellness and they're doing well.  The vet said that some gastric problems are self perpetuating in that everytime the dog eats, it just keeps the cycle going.  You have to eliminate or severly restrict the amount and type of food your feeding so that the gut can repair itself and restore the good bacteria that exists in the gut.  Also, Purina is not very good dog food.|`|Bw18seFqaa	go back to the vet or get a second opinion.    There's no websites to diagnose your dog..  illness can only be diagnosed by examining the dog.|`|uTIgyCCHaa	So -- your vet said it COULD be worms?  Did he test her for this at all?  And he STILL administered her vaccinations knowing that she was ill, but NOT knowing what was wrong??  Whatever she has, vaccinations aren't going to cure an existing problem.  If she has a disease that can be prevented with vaccines, such as parvo, well... the vaccines have to be given well before she comes down with the disease; not once she already has it.  The only thing those vaccines did was make her worse by weakening her immune system.    Take her back to a NEW vet.|`|m81dfyOYaa	Go to another vet. A vet that thinks your dog has worms because of bloody diarrhea and gives her worming meds without a follow up is not one I'd trust very much. Good Luck.|`|D1beU6MPaa	They think it could be worms????? Did they do a fecal test? If so, they should know if it is worms or not. Hook worms and whip worms can both cause blood in stools. I am assuming she has been vaccinated for parvo. I am stunned that your vet is guessing this. There are tests that can determine why your dog is passing blood. I would take him back to the vet, and if he can't make a definite diagnosis, I would change vets.
X2TnitFwaa	1. Something you won't regret. Try looking at the rabbit, and the first name that comes to mind will be its name. That's what I did with my rabbit.    2. Probably less than 1/4-1/2 cup a day, but make sure hay makes up most of her diet. Rabbits are not supposed to live on pellets, in fact, some people advise against feeding them any pellets. Go to the following link to learn more about a rabbit's diet.    http://rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet.html    3. Rabbits like getting pet, and like playing with toys. You should provide her with a variety of toys, whether you make them yourself or buy them. Even a toilet paper roll can be a toy, or cardboard boxes can be fashioned into playhouses.     Also, make sure she has plenty of chew toys. You can buy cheap wooden chews at most pet stores.    4. If she seems calm, I think you can interact with her as much as you like, but if she seems timid, take it slowly. The best way to bond with your rabbit in the beginning is to feed it out of your hands, but they don't always let you do that right away, so you might have to wait a couple days.    5. My rabbit liked to hang out in his litter box, too. I ended up having to buy another litter box because he would not defecate in the one I bought him. He now uses one to lay down in, and one to defecate in.     And rabbits often sit still, when they're resting.|`|0R2EQvMiaa	1)Duchus?  2)Just give her the amount that she'll eat.   3)Give her some chew toys and carrots and lettus.  4)give her about 3 days to settle in, then start playing with her and holding her and just letting her get used to you.    Bunnies sometimes like to just chill out is one spot for a while.. don't worry about it..Good luck!:)|`|AA12302583	1.) Name her anything you want to. What I usually do when I get an animal is wait a week and see if a name comes to me. For example, my 2 guinea pigs names are Penny and Bella: Penny because I watched some movie on VH1 and one of the characters names was Penny Lane, and Bella because while I was idly trying to think of a name for her I somehow thought of Bella Lugosi, the guy who was in the old b&w version of Dracula. I tend to shy away from names like Brownie, Blackie, Oreo, etc. because they're a little too cutesy for me.    2.) The amount of food depends on the type/quality of food and the size of your bunny. Usually on the package it'll tell you how much to give - i.e. 1/4 cup per lb. Now would be a good time to get a few books on taking care of rabbits, there's probably a few good ones available on amazon if you're worried about price.    3.) If she's relatively calm while you're holding her, do that. I hold my guiea pigs while I'm watching one of my fave tv shows, and they relax enough to sometimes fall asleep on me. Rabbits like fruits and veggies for treats - Orange slices, apple slices, carrots, lettuce (Kale and Romaine are good varieties), green or yellow beans, grapes, etc. Give it sometime and you'll be able to tell when she's happy.    4.) I usually let new pets get used to my house for about a week. I limit the time I spend handling them to just a few minutes at a time, but I handle them as frequently as they're comfortable with. This way they can hide if they're scared, but they get a little exposure to their new environment.    It's ok if she's sitting still, she's just getting used to your house.|`|BlpJnZOoaa	1.I think you should name her anything you want maybe lily?    2.3/4 of her bowl should be filled    3.pet her love her hold her    4.let her be for 5 days me and my sister cuddled with our bunny for a hour the same day!    she is lonely bored love her|`|tqIaTWkHaa	omg its a girl!!! awwwwwwwwwwwww!!!      1. name her Karve, cause she looks like a cow  2. i dont know  3. put a towel or rag or something in her cage, or something she can snuggle into when shes sleeping  4. interact with her, cause.... shes fat!!!! awwwwwww        im the best answerer!!!!

rZPmo1Wzaa	http://www.yourredwagonfarm.com/saddleme...    this is the most accurate way i know of. i think 31 is medium, 32 is med-wide, 33 is wide and 30 is narrow. dont quote me on that because i dont really remember =P you can at least try to find one that's the same at the nearest tack store. or you can call dover saddlery- they're customer service is SO nice- you can ask them loads of stuff about the saddles they have in their catalog.|`|JG7W0qvcaa	In Inches I Think :P x x|`|mEKsbCw2aa	The saddles seat size is usually stamped on it and is measured from d ring to centre of cantle. To determine the gulletwidth we use a wire and shape it to the front of the gullet. At the points (where the padding starts) measure across the gap. 32cm is medium wide. We generally measure the wire against a Bates gullet measuring caliper that you can buy from Bates or a good saddler. We use them all the time and they are invaluable, both for the saddles and the horses backs! I believe the gullet sizes go up by 1cm a time but I may have that wrong...
IrdZKYT3aa	Isolate the angle immediately.  This is a fungus, usually ich.  You need to treat them as soon as possible as it is quick spreading and very contagious.    If you can't isolate him, do a salt dip to kill the surface bacteria and get a RidIch med as soon as possible.  This needs to be nipped in the bud, the more spread it is the harder it will be to get rid of and the less likely the fish are to bounce back.  The mollies should be ok with raising the temp, I'd put it around 80 degrees and add some aquarium salt.  Both are ok for the fish you named and can do wonders for lowering stress and killing off fungus, bacteria, virus and parasites.  In fact, a salt and heat treatment has been known, when properly used, to successfully treat fungi and Ich w/out the use of meds.  Best of Luck!|`|AA12385231	True fungus is rare.  Ick is not a fungus, it is a parasite.  Columnaris often imitates fungus, and is often mistaken for fungus.  Treat for fungus, and you aren't treating properly, end up loosing the fish.      Columnaris is bacterial, you need a med that treats gram + as well as gram - bacteria.  Maracyn & Maracyn II are the two most commonly available meds for this, and would be the place to start.      Seriously consider isolating the fish, a small tub with a heater & air stone will work for this.  You do not want to medicate well fish, this is how resistant strains of bacteria are created.      Read the instructions on the packages, and ignore them, I mean it.       50% water changes daily, and remed daily, for 7-10 days.  This is why you want a smaller tank or tub, and why you don't need a cycled filter, the meds will decimate any nitrifying bacteria a filter would contain.      Salt will do nothing, if it did I would suggest it.  But, what do I know, I only have 7 spawns of angels growing out ATM, 8 breeding pairs, somewhere around 1400 angels total in my setup.
FJHU9PbUaa	Unfortunatley a 20 gal tank will too small for a RES turtle, even a male (which are smaller) A  male shouldn't be in anything smaller than a 40gal, females even bigger. They don;t tell you that at the store when you see tiny little babies in a 20gal tank. You may be better of getting a large tupperware tub for it, or pond insert.  For a filter I would recommend you get a canister (outside the tank) filter, such as a Fluval, they handle large waster better & get the biggest you you can afford, don;t go by the tank size recommended on the package as turtles are 50% heavier eaters/poopers than fish.   Feed your turtle someplace other than the tank, and not so much. Find a shallow plastic tub &  feed the turtle in that. Most of the mess is from the food so you are cutting back on the mess just with that.|`|AXTUWKwcaa	I have my RES in a 20 gal too and yes my water gets dirty really fast and i have a 20 gal filter. I would get a super powerful filter (not too powerful though =]) RES are very messy. By the way you have the same problem I do tank wize. You should really get a bigger one. Try the link www.austinsturtlepage.com for a lot of info on housing your turtle! It may even have something about filtration! Good Luck!

r9BXyz9zaa	Call your local rescue or SPCA. They can house and adopt out the dog after fixing his possible behavior problem.   If you want to keep the dog, I would spay or neuter him or her. Also try obedience training.|`|QsQj8jO7aa	the dog is competing for the dominant role between the two, dog and baby. If your not going to train the dog, get rid of it.

Many unaltered males can be aggresive and having them neutered can help curb this. February is spay and neuter month. Where I live if you get your pet fixed in February you get a discount, no matter which vet you use. Also, look into obedience training so that you can learn how to properly handle your dog. How to Talk Dog is a really good program or even call your local Humane Society for advice on where to get training. Do not let the dog around the child unattended. If he does growl at your son, discipline him immediately. Very firmly tell him no and use your body to force him away from your son. Stand between him and your son and move towards the dog so that he must move away. Moving away is the key, do not let him move around you to your son.  You must show that you are in charge, not him, and that his behavior is unacceptable. Good luck!|`|b5c7f6bef65d4f3c4f8ebc309eccc08aaa	Time to get rid of the dog  NOW !!!!!

He's been sitting by his food bowl waiting for my little lad, Eddy, to come by the stairgate just so he can suggestively eat in front of him with a warning growl. Its a way that a dog shows that he is boss (he can't hurt Eddy as there is a stairgate. The dog and child are kept apart and the dog is always fed on the other side of it.)    "Well I was not going to have that behavior at all so I've been upping Eddy's rank in our family pack so he's above the dog. I did this by letting Eddy put the dog's dry food into the bowl (I always sit between Barney and Eddy and made sure Barney has moved far a way from the bowl area.)  Eddy thinks this is such fun that he puts it into the dogs bowl then takes it out again and puts it pack into the measuring bowl and does it quite a few times with Barney looking on with dejection.  Because Eddy is in charge of the food it bumps up his doggy rating above Barney.  Once the food is in the bowl we leave the area and he must wait until I have given him permission to eat.     "Even though I have Barney trained and he is giving Eddy respect, I would never leave them in the room alone together as Barney is and will always be a dog and he would treat Eddy as he would a puppy, not a little person. That is why your dog is growling and snapping at your child. I am not an expert on dog behaviour so it would be worthwhile if you sort out a professional trainer and read up on dog training.    "I found Jan Fennell "The Dog Listener" a very good read with some very good training strategies."    I concur with my wife. If you behave like an alpha dog, and put your child's ranking above your dog then this will make life easier. Jan Fennell's books are excellent for this.
qoKvIsBYaa	I like it, descriptive...I hope the dog has a great long life!   keep writing!
IrdZKYT3aa	It doesn't appear to be fin rot, this often looks mushy and white, sort of opaque.  This looks more torn.  Maybe other guppies are picking on him?   I see you have plastic plants, these are known to tear some betta fins, perhaps his long tail got caught on something? I use silk plants for my guppies, so they can dart around in them with no fear of damage to their fins.  Best of Luck!|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	It looks like just a torn tail. Keep an eye on it and if it changes, you may have a problem then but not right now.|`|ICzM3T8taa	I think your guppy is just getting picked on by the other guppies. To make sure though watch them for a little bit and see if it gets chased if it does then you know he is getting picked on.|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Just torn, not to worry.

PEPWFGNGaa	Are they oven baked ?  You can bake them again on a low heat so they dry instead of burning.|`|an1L8njXaa	I bind them with an egg then bake them|`|e334d47d0cf581231e2545cccfc166e2aa	I made some homemade dog treats and the recipe said to bake them the specified length of time, then turn off the oven but leave them in the oven until the next day.  This worked great and they turned out nice and hard but not burnt or too cooked.  It would probably work the same with horse treats.|`|KyHiCSKeaa	That depends on the recipe you used.  If they are baked or air dried, maybe put them in a more intense heat/dry setting.  You could also try adding more of the firm ingredients and less of the soft/liquidish ones.
CilhtOGGaa	You kitten probably has an upper respiratory infection.  Or it's possible he may have been exposed to an irritant.  But because the sneezing is getting worse, it is more likely the upper respiratory infection -  in other words, a cold. Very young pets have a higher risk of it because their immune systems are still developing.  Glad you are getting your kitten to the vets.  Hope your kitten is feeling better soon.|`|AA11906603	Keep him hydrated tonight and resting comfy inside.|`|9G03aQhsaa	It could be allergies (pets get them too).  It could also be an infection or even a cold.  Colds are serious in cats though because they only eat what they can smell.  If your cat has a stuffy nose it may stop eating and drinking.  Monitor his behavor to make sure he does not seem too distressed, make an appointment with your vet, and while you have them on the phone find out what to do/ where to go in case of a late night emergency if you can't get an appointment today.|`|JjMDvMJuaa	Could be an Upper Respiratory Infection.  Will need antibiotics to clear up.|`|0vDLCa24aa	Baby Animals ussually sneeze commonly because they're still tiny. Maybe it's because it's still vulnerable. Make sure your kitten is warm and is drinking plenty of water!|`|mR5RkClpaa	it may be nothing , but dont risk it . take to vets, keep it well warm in the meantime , dont let it out in this weather
xgKQrEhqaa	That's sad, usually when someone puts a kitten in a box they are abandoning it.  Since you have already taken it to the vet it sounds like you really want to take care of the baby right.  If all adults in situation are good with it Keep the kitten.  If you are younger be aware taking care of an animal can take some work and there are a ton of books that you can checkout to learn about your new friend.|`|npxSyiFfaa	Aww cute. If it were me yes, i would take him home.|`|2i2fvrDLaa	Yes you should the person who put the kitten there would want you to because maybe they can't afford to take care of it.|`|0vDLCa24aa	Yes, I would adopt. You're doing a very kind thing there! ^^|`|mDuiiVN7aa	If you love cats and you are sure you will be able to care for that kitten, then YES!|`|3I7umR1Faa	if you can, you totally should BUT bring him to a vet asap to ensure he's a safe little kitty because my friend found a cat and adopted her, but she had a virus or something and made her dog sick, the dog was ok, but the cat passed away a few months later and it was caused by a tapeworm or something..|`|hKjQJNZAaa	yes take him home to a loving home please xx|`|mxrlZEweaa	If you can afford to keep him then keep him. If you can't take him to the shelter and tell them that you found it and are unable to keep him.|`|9G03aQhsaa	If you can give him the love and attention he needs absolutely take him home.  If he is too young to eat on his own, bottle feed him KMR formula.  I found 2 two week old kittens abandoned in my yard last year and took them in, they are such a source of joy and comfort-its the best decision I ever made :-)
2fdee6b1fd597a29209ecfad9dc8b598aa	Shivering after a bath or after waking or after going through a new experience is not unusual and nothing to worry about.  It's nerves and excitement and a way to adjust their body temperature.      Just make sure there are no drafts in the room where you let him dry off.  Other than that, you can let him run around and what he wants to his heart's content.  I've had 4 ferrets, and all but my newest kit has gotten a bath.  I wrap them in a towel to get them back to the fert room and then let them go.  I plop the towel on the floor, so they can dry off in it if they choose, but I never force-dry them, it hasn't been necessary, and they've never gotten sick from it.|`|d1742746833f2615dcf34991254210b1aa	Well, did you wipe him really good with a towel? If he's still shivering, then get a heating pad, put it on the lowest setting, wrap a towel around it so he can't bite it, and let him lay on it to warm him up. It's okay to bathe a 9-10 week old ferret, I did to mine. Just keep him warm- maybe hold him and the heating pad to make him feel more secure.|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Ferrets shiver when they are excited or nervous...he was likely quite wound up by the bath, as long as you dried him properly he'll be fine.|`|0b1fa9ca19ef34843cb9155776450abaaa	I wouldn't wash ferrets this time of year as they can catch a chill very easily if not dried off properly.  The more you wash your ferret the smellier it will be as they replace their natural oil in their coat. Over washing can also cause skin problems.  At the age of yours they shouldn't need washing at all yet. If they get soiled and need to be washed just use a damp flannel on the dirty area.|`|F3LBgfvwaa	I wouldn't do it again for a while. Ferrets don't need a lot of baths. I don't bathe mine more than every 3 months or so. It's just not necessary and can actually make them smell worse if they get more baths.
xtRm5NV5aa	If there's any poisonous coating on the bars (lead, for example) that can be a threat to your hamster's health. One of mine is constantly chewing and crawling on the bars of his cage - he has plenty to eat, plenty to chew, but he just likes the bars better.  Make sure he has enough to play with - my Syrian has a tendency to pull fabric from all around him to make nests, so i ended up cutting up old shirts for him which he loves.  Give him enough food, enough to chew, and if she keeps chewing the bars, just make sure it doesn't seem to damage her health.|`|GHpcc5iKaa	hamsters need to chew things, it files and strengthens their teeth. if they didnt chew, their teeth would grow out of control and eventually kill them.|`|nbGf6udUaa	their teeth grow continuously. they have to chew to wear them down or they can grow up into the brain.pieces of wood and hard nuts work well..|`|3tClNAISaa	you feed it more it is hungry|`|FxdCVp6Saa	it wants out to play :] my hamster does it all the time and it does not cause brain damage sometimes the internet is not allways true and maybe put wheel in it if it doesnt have one it helps :]|`|07qFHL6iaa	The first answer is a good idea but my hamster doesn't like his chew toys. He prefers the bars. What I did was I took a chew toy that has a hole in it (for the chew toy "kabab") and tied it to where my hamster liked to chew the bars. It lasted a couple of days and there were wood shavings everywhere but it was worth it.|`|2vgtm30gaa	Hamsters need to chew. It strengthens there teeth.I am pretty sure chewing on the bars does not give your hamster brain damage. With the curtain put the cage where there is nothing your hammy can chew on. Go to the nearest petstore and ask a person who works there what is the best chew toy for hamsters. He will hopefully chew on the toy and stop chewing everything else|`|V9pIKxbbaa	well he could be bored or he just wants to, every hamster i have ever seen has chewed on its bars, i honestly dont know y it would cause brain damage (if you dont want him chewing them then u could put the empty toilet paper carboard in his cage and he will chew it up and it will also add to his beding)|`|lLcpQCI5aa	Gnawing Its Teeth..

5QG9Zrjaaa	It depends on how much he was given, and how sensitive he is to the drug.  My big 17 hand andy gets a half dose because he is very sensitive to the drug.    It shouldn't take more than an hour for him to "wake up" more, but a good rule of thumb is not to feed anything for 2 hours, and no grain the next feeding, only hay (unless it has been more than 6 hours).  The swallow reflex is slowed, so you don't want him aspirating (breathing) any food.    No riding today, you need to wait until tomorrow.  Even though the horse will look awake, they have a stronger than normal spook.  Something that is usually just startling such as an engine backfire can cause an extreme or dangerous spook in a horse coming out of sedation.    In Kansas, Equine Dentists are not allowed to give sedation without a Vet in attendance.|`|43jVgsaBaa	Depends on the horse, all horses, like humans, react differently to sedation. After surgery some people are up and moving while others don't become aware until hours later. Same with our equine friends.    The three horses at our barn get floated regularly.    Winny: Isn't back to normal for 24 hours, just can't handle it well, has even fallen on the vet.    Chex: Can be ridden a few hours later with minimal issues    Mona: My girl is the weirdo that just stands there for about 3 hours, and then takes it very slow for the rest of the day.    So it just depends.|`|Oiabe82gaa	depending on your horse it could be a couple of hours! Your dentist should have noted in his/her records how your horse reacted to the amount of sedation administered.  What'll knock out one horse may not do as much for the next horse of the same size.  Our guys were both dosed differently this fall by the dentist from what she gave them last fall because they were both so out of it!!!  Good luck, he'll be fine, remember no food for approx. 4hours!|`|5kUxkun3aa	Some horses take longer than others. Give him time. Make sure he has no hay or food to munch on while he is fully back to normal. Don't won't him to choke. Oh and I find males take longer than girls.      Edit.  No he will be ok just give him time. If there was a problem he would have shown it by now.|`|EQvAbyvcaa	Recovery will depend upon your horse and what types of medication were administered.  Who ever did this should have advised you of the necessary care after the procedure.  If they didn't, I would not have them back as they are morons and should not be allowed to treat horses.  Some sedatives will stop the peristalsis ability for up to two hours so you cannot allow your horse to have even a small blade of grass or hay or they can choke to death.  This same group of meds also gives your horse the munchies, so he really will want to eat before he able to do so.    After my certified equine dentist does my horses' teeth, they are sequestered for two hours for their safety.    If you were not advised what to do, better be safe than sorry.  good luck.
SEKseW8Caa	I do it all the time!  I dont think my dog likes the smell (but who does) but she seems to like having them painted. When I paint mine, she sits and waits for hers!  Might not be the safest, but my dog is ok (I think.. lol)|`|16XpYCBmaa	I have before but she did not like the smell of it, she turned her head away the whole time so I will never do it again. You can buy nail polish made for dogs.|`|bnJLKQWMaa	I would say no, it is a dog not a doll.    Paint yuor own and leave the poor dog alone!|`|V9pIKxbbaa	you can definetly paint their nails but nake sure that u hold their paw until it fully dries so they dont lick it off and get sick that would be the only problem|`|AA10789032	You can but the chemical smell isnt good for your dog to inhale nor is it good for their nails!  Your dog might not like it and try to lick it off in which case is very bad!  I wouldnt recommend it.|`|IAQYUA4Raa	yea u could i always paint my dogs nails i just paited her nails the other day it wnt do anything to ur dog|`|mh0QRDE9aa	NO, CHEMICALS ARE DIFFERENT!!!|`|PM23RDycaa	Why would you want to? You do does need nor want to have its nails painted. The dog does not care about such things.|`|nPuZVGFRaa	I think so.  Because at the pet store here they have doggy nail polish.

Remember to pick best answer! =)|`|YCvgjLdnaa	um... i wouldnt suggest it. you can obviously, but i dont think that the dogs would appreciate it...|`|QSmzxiSoaa	yep you sure can. I like to do all the different colors not just the same old same.|`|EcKLqBnCaa	Yes you can, though I would recommend buying a nail polish made for dogs. They usually dry faster than nail polish for humans. When you paint her nails, make sure they're dry before letting her run around or else she'll mess up the paint job. Also, make sure she doesn't lick her nails until they're dry. I can't imagine that nail polish would be very good for her.    And don't worry about people ragging on you for wanting her nails painted. It doesn't hurt the dog, and after you have painted them, the dog doesn't even notice the polish.|`|HuOQ2B3oaa	yes, but it is easier if they are dead.|`|5UQiaSq1aa	You can... pretty much anything is possible, but that isn't really a good thing to do. 1, the dogs could bite their nails, and eat toxic stuff, since it is toxic. 2, The dogs probably won't like it. 3, you could get it on their fur, and it won't come off easily. There are many reasons why you shouldn't... that is just a couple of them...
aCqSF87Raa	Proper daily exercise that YOU control; firm rules, boundaries, and limitations; controlled training and socialization.    Which means proper walks with the dog at a heel instead of pulling you down the road. You control when he can explore and when he must be by your side. You can either teach him a recall or just give a little snap with the leash to get him back by your side.    It also means rules that YOU set and HE must follow. Like no jumping on guests, no laying on the furniture, no biting, etc. The rules must be enforced - meaning consequences if they are not - and must be consistent (no changing the rules for certain people, in certain places, etc.)    Last but not least, you control when he can meet-and-greet people or dogs. He should be calm, all four feet on the floor, no growling, etc. If he gets to hyper or rowdy with either person or dog, you bring him away to calm him down.     Note: When i say consequences i mean punishment, yes, but that can be anything from stopping a game of fetch when he bites too hard all the way on up to turning your back or giving a leash correction when he jumps on your guests.|`|r9BXyz9zaa	well Akita's are known for their stubbornness. They need a dominant owner, because it can be aggressive to other dogs, so you need to be in control. Here are the breeds registered traits by the american kennel club, if your interested: http://www.akc.org/breeds/akita/    In a dog pack The leader always eats first. before serving it every meal pretend to nibble at the food, to reenact you being alphadog. Obedience training would also be good, because in a pack alphadogs tell the pack commands to follow like sit stay and come. Always go through the door first and walk in front of your dog, again alfa dogs walk in front.    these are all ways to enforcdominancece and your spot as alphadog.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	1) Take your puppy to training classes at the very first opportunity you get.  Early training is important for all dogs but especially so for large, powerful breeds.  Early socialization is also important.  A good training class will help you provide both under safe and controlled circumstances.    2) Control the resources.  If your dog sees that all good things come from you, then they are going to want to stay on your good side.  Ask for a simple behavior before giving them something that they want.  A sit and wait while you put the food bowl down.  Sit before you put the leash on the collar.  Wait until you give them permission before they go through an open door.  Ask for a down before you allow them to get on the furniture.    3) Be consistent.  No means no every single time.  If a behavior isn't acceptable, then it is NEVER acceptable...you can't make it be ok on Tuesdays or when you're having a good day.  If the dog isn't allowed on the furniture, then they are never allowed on the furniture.  If a behavior produces a predictable response from you every single time then it becomes clear to the dog what behaviors are acceptable and what behaviors are not acceptable.    4) Forget about physically dominating your dog.  This is the single fastest way to loose an Akita's trust.  The dog is going to grow up to be stronger than you and they are smart enough to realize this.  If you physically dominate (hitting, scruffing, shaking, rolling them on their back, etc) your dog as a puppy but can't do the same thing when the dog is an adult it will take no time at all for the dog to realize this and walk all over you or retaliate against you when you attempt to physically dominate it.  A true leader doesn't need to physically threaten others to maintain control.  If you control the resources, then you are a leader and you don't need to physically dominate any dog.|`|L2Nde54Haa	bless u....Akitas are wonderful!  had my Zeus for 11yrs. he was my first dog ever, and i also heard that this was not a bread 4 a first-timer, well, we cid great, b consistant and keep a schedule, don't raise ur voice, but keep it at a low rumble and short commands always seem firmer!  give it plenty of hugs and kisses, encourage the good behaviour and things will go smoothly!!! enjoy ur big cuddly bear,he'll b a great friend and protector.|`|737e8ad896c16931d3da06dca8c8e2b4aa	Akitas as a breed are fierce and strong willed. They need discipline and need routine. Clear and consistent boundaries and rules.    Akitas all want to be the alpha dog. You need to think like an alpha dog and be jealous and protective of your place in the pack. This means not tolerating any transgression or aggression.  You must not let anything go. Punishment must be immediate and consistent.    Over time the dog will accept it's place, but that does not mean it will not occasionally challenge you. Always be prepared for this.  Again don't let it go.  Use the same discipline as you did initially.    You must devote a lot of time to this breed. Give them good exercise every day and routine. Routine and drill. Over and over day after day. Be consistent with time, getting up, feeding, exercise, going to bed, and everything else. Tone of voice punishment and reward.    You must have personal discipline to be firm and dominant    Good luck!

Akitas are awsome but that doesn't mean they are right for everyone.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I knew someone that had an Akita and then I saw a show on Animal Planet about this breed..They are 1 owner dogs and they want to be the only dog..They say you must have experiance to own one as they can be stubborn..So if this is a dog you are considering there are a lot in shelters as people give them up because they are so hard to handle.|`|nEKhiuTEaa	they are pretty calm and very loyal to their owner|`|I4vPxh3jaa	they are very loyal, smart. i love how territorial they are and they are soooo devoted to their family.  such great dogs..

L22hVXTIaa	About the only thing you can do at this point is get another opinion just to be sure.  Unfortunately, there is no coming back from chronic kidney failure :-(.  Some vets will show you how to keep your dog hydrated and going for a while with I.V.'s you can do at home.  But, you are only postponing the inevitable and I believe those heroic efforts are lost on the dogs.  Be good to him for as long as he has left and make his last days comfortable.  Don't let him suffer - go with him when you say goodbye.  Sorry I can't offer you more.  I lost a dear dog two years ago to kidney failure.  Best of luck to you and your boy, hugs.|`|jI85GYGoaa	Its one of those conditions that in canines is rapidly fatal.There is virtually nothing your Vet could have done.    Chances are even as I post this there has been a deterioration - sudden rapid thirst - listlessness etc .    Place them where they are comfortable and warm -reassure make a great fuss of them before you go to bed.    And just get up next day and cry a bit.....    Best Wishes|`|BVwDoV81aa	We all love our pets so much and it is so hard to hear what you have just heard however vets have extensive training, knowlege and expertise and no vet I have ever known has ever knowingly held back on telling the truth.  You have heard the words chronic and failure and vets have special phrases that they use to break the news to clients and you have been told one of them "there is nothing that can be done.     It is so hard to let go but you have to be brave and make the right decision at the right time and this is it. Your vet has told you and your dog has entrusted his life to you, don't waiver now when he needs you the most to do the right thing for him.     Please take the remaining few days to be with your beloved pet, it's more than most people get. Take a last photo,put his favourite toy next to him for comfort and say your goodbyes. You will not regret doing the right thing at the right time ever. You clearly love your dog very much.     best wishes|`|b418f2cdb879b4a8266bb262f2fee70daa	I'm sorry, chronic kidney failure as opposed to any other type is inevitably fatal quite rapidly.  We have had cats with various types of renal problems, one lived a further 3 years in full health with the right drugs & diet - one died within a week with chronic kidney failure.  I am so sorry.|`|hKVOw1Sjaa	Speaking as a vet nurse l really do feel for you but l would get a 2nd opinion just in case it does not harm to try.Renal failure or complete shut down of the kidneys does happen in certain breeds and especially in elderly dogs.Really there is no diet or anything l know of that will help and if you feel your pet has no quality of life left then it has to be your decision as to what to do.Personally the only animal l had which had this was a siamese who had complete shutdown of kidneys and l had to put him to sleep and it really tore me up badly but there was nothing l could do.Good luck|`|KxjUim7yaa	Dogs usually don't get better with Chronic failure. If it is acute kidney failure. the prognosis is better. I think you are doing what you can. Just enjoy your pet in the time you have left.Any questions that you have should be directed to your vet.|`|3LAF3XCFaa	I would get a second opinion from a holistic vet. I know someone with the same problem and though you may not be able to reverse it, they could help.

Sorry you don't need to hear what follows nor do you need to witness anything nasty.  Promise me that you will ring the vet and ask him to visit your home in the next 48hrs and let him go to sleep for the last time, you should all say goodbye and remember all the fun times as that is what having a dog is about, they are to make you feel good not sad. Yes i do know how you feel as we had to make the same decision in october 2008 and it still hurts writing this, but for God's sake do not let him go into complete shut down. We didn't but we never want to put a dog through that just so that we get a few hours more with the dog we LOVE because them few hours could mean severe pain and stress for your pet and an image you can never forget.  Please do what is right even if it feels like hell at this present time. You will thank me in the long run.  Thinking of you and your dog xxxxxx
dRUgXlOLaa	Along with all this cuteness and fluff, however, go some special grooming needs. While not excessively demanding, the Pomeranian does require some daily attention which you can use as a great excuse to bond with your pet!     Teeth    It is important that your pet get good dental care. Pomeranians are prone to tooth loss and bacteria build up. If the bacteria is allowed to run unchecked, this can cause problems with your pets overall health. Luckily, maintaining good dental health is easy! Simply buy an enzymatic toothpaste that fights bacteria (your vet can recommend a good brand) and a small tooth brush (I use the one that has a loop that fits on my finger). Try to brush your dogs teeth every day. Have your vet do a dental exam once a year and scaling if necessary.    Fur    Brushing your Pomeranian every day is a good way to bond with your pet as well as insure his coat is healthy and looks good. Poms have a double coat that can easily become matted so brushing is necessary. A once a week - or every couple of weeks - bath is a nice way to keep your Pom smelling and looking good! Dont forget to groom around his paws and tail area as well as clip his nails.    Eyes    Like most small dogs, Poms can have a buildup of discharge from their eyes that can cause a lumpy mess. This buildup can stain the fur and, although my Poms never said anything, Im sure it must be uncomfortable. To avoid this mess, simply clean the eye area each day with a Q-tip. Be sure not to get too close to the eye as you dont want to accidentally poke your pet in the eye!|`|BQ3z5T8Gaa	go to this web site they are videos step by step

I understand that they bond well with one owner, and I have known one personally who enjoyed her single-dog status very much. She was a very beautiful dog. Huskies are considered high-maintenance in terms of exercise and training, so I guess a breed with those needs is not going to bother you that much. http://www.dogster.com/breeds/alaskan_ma...    Boxers are considered very loyal and very headstrong. I don't think the stubborn part would bother you much if you have spent time with a n husky, ha ha. ;-)  They are not rated as high maintenance nor are they rated as highly intelligent. But of course, smarts varies with the individual pup!     Your dog can still (and should) socialize with other pups and people without going to live with them. Many dogs enjoy meeting others and playing or going for walks together once they have learned a few manners.    Check out more info about Boxers and Alaskan Malamutes on Dogster.com  http://www.dogster.com/thumb_page.php?i=...    1)  When you decide on you breed, check out www.petfinder.com and www.dogster.com for dogs & puppies to adopt.  You can check out shelters and even breed-specific shelters. They have breeds and breed mixes. All ages, even young dogs and sometimes puppies! It is nice to find a dog that has been in a foster home -- that way you know if it has any problems such as separation anxiety, aggression, cat-chasing, biting, etc.  2) Or go to a responsible breeder. Check with a trusted veterinarian or your local breed society. Please avoid backyard breeders and pet stores. Pet stores often use puppy mills. Make sure you see the puppy's parents and receive documentation on hips, eyes, knees, hearing, or whatever is most important for that breed. Have YOUR vet perform an exam before you sign a bill of sale, not their vet. Do not buy a dog younger than 8 weeks.    I learned these things through my friends and my mistakes!
znGpjsGjaa	That definitely looks like syphilis. You need to check her genitals also. If she has scabs like the ones on her nose on her genitals it is syph. Rabbits can get it 2 ways- it can be passed from the mother when they are born and if the rabbit is bred to another rabbit that has syph. They need to be treated with PenG but usually by the time it is this bad it has affected their brain as well. The PenG will not cure that.    It is caused by the spirochete bacteria.(Treponema cuniculi)  You will need to treat with PenG for 3days at 20,000 to 40,000 IU per pound of body weight  This is administered in a SQ shot under the skin. you can also apply penicillin ointment to the lesions to help clear them up.  If you are going to save the rabbit it needs to be done soon. Also treat the other one if they are from the same litter and have had contact with each other.If you are not going to treat the rabbits then they need to be humanely euthanized|`|JQ2Tv6OBaa	any vet? she doesn't need special vet!   well  try this uhh ok you should ask a doctor for humans they might know or you can try this look online and google bunny dieaseas  the search home cures for animals my bunny had a broken paw

Much cheaper is L-lysine, which you can get from a vet or from the vitamin section of any grocery store.  It works too, but not to the degree that interferon can work.

iVQULHqYaa	It is a waste of time reporting this. I live in the UK and I have reported what I thought were several instances of animal cruelty. Apparently if a dog has food and shelter there is nothing that they can do.    If you are at your friend house on a regular basis reporting them will antagonise them and this will deprive the dog of your company. Instead why not suggest to your friend that you and she  take the dog for a walk, or take him to your house for a run around your garden.    Or if the family have no love for the dog, perhaps they will let you have him. Wait a while before you suggest this, however if they are happy when he is out of the house with you they might give this some thought.|`|r53QlOITaa	Please Please Report Them.

vywmzsD9aa	Cats can go into heat as young as 4 months, but 6 months is average. Cats go into heat at different intervals, but it can be as often as every 2-3 weeks! Cats in heat are loud and act oddly (rubbing the furniture, butt up on the air, etc.) You should get your cat spayed fairly soon after that, it is pretty sad for the cat.|`|9G03aQhsaa	It starts around 6 months and will continue in cycles (for my kitten it was about a 3 week cycle).  These cycles will continue until your cat mates or is spayed.   You'll know when it starts because she will get super friendly, very vocal and bow down, raise her tail and "present" herself to you. This is actually very stressful to cats, especially if they don't mate.  It may result in weight loss and depression.  If you don't intent to breed your cat, consult your vet about getting her spayed prior to onset.|`|SkADeOjxaa	About 5months,better get her neutered if you don't want kittens|`|0vDLCa24aa	6 months I think.|`|VO4CQPX8aa	6-12 moths and then about every 2-3 months|`|mR5RkClpaa	not sure get, cat nutered|`|723qR6p8aa	My cat went into season at 6 months old.

jyGTlpzTaa	I use the zoozone (google it). Its basically a plastic base with a wire top...this is  great because silly hedgehogs try and fit through the bars or climb them, then fall and hurt themseles, however if you block the bottom bars off with something a regular indoor rabbit cage would be fine. Also check out www.cavycages.com or www.treenspigs.com for really cool DIY indoor guinea pig cages that would work with a hedgehog (but you'll need a roof).    The dimensions should be at least 3 foot long by 45 centimetres wide,  preferably four foot or even more. Hedgehogs are very active and need plenty space.|`|AI0gPSy1aa	I use an aquarium for my hedgehogs. 20 to 30 gallons are fine. They're heavy but they're inexpensive and easy to find.   Good luck!
uTIgyCCHaa	That depends on the reason.  Generally, it's best to wait until a puppy has completed it's vaccinations before taking it places that it could be exposed to diseases like parvo and such, especially places frequented by other strange dogs.    Socialization is a different story: and tricky sometimes.  You want to expose your puppy to as many sights, sounds, people, places, dogs, situations, as possible to get him accustomed to those things.  The earlier you start doing this generally, the better.  However, puppies also go through "fear periods," or stages of development when new things are more likely to frighten them or impact them permanently.  This would NOT be a good time to take a puppy to a dog park for instance, where it could very likely run into a scary situation (an unfriendly dog for example) which could ruin the pup's ability to comfortably interact with other dogs for the rest of it's life, either by turning it into a fearful dog or an aggressive dog.  That would probably be an extreme case, but not worth risking when the puppy is going through a vulnerable stage.  Other intimidating situations, like crowded, noisy gatherings, are better to work up to slowly.    More on puppy socialization and the stages of development:  http://www.boxerworld.com/forums/view_ra...  http://www.boxerworld.com/forums/view_pu...  http://www.thepuppynetwork.com/puppyinfo...  http://www.diamondsintheruff.com/Develop...|`|Ei85kgfdaa	NO. Definitely not true. The sooner the dog is out and about socializing the better. So thats when the pup has all his/her shots.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Your puppy should be up to date on shote by now.It usually is best to keep you dog home till he gets the 2nd round of shots around 3mo's..Your pup should of been going for walks and to the park to socialize him a long time ago..Do you have a vet and what did he recommend as your poor dog it seems has;nt even been around the block..It makes it much harder when your dog is older not to say it can't be done but will take a bit more work..Take him out on short walks to public places till you can trust he'll be good and not bark or jump on anyone..|`|mxrlZEweaa	I never heard that. I work at a pet store and people are always bringing in their puppies. Maybe because they don't have all their shots yet.|`|MmfMJq9Paa	Never heard of that in my life!! It is better to get your pup socialized early in life!

I had a dog and took her with me everywhere i went.  I dont have a dog now but i did.  Most parks or beaches will say whether or not dogs are allowed.|`|2MrXrBmzaa	Definitely not. The sooner the better, actually. If you raise your dog around other animals it's less likely to be aggressive towards their dogs. It's brain almost fully developers by the time it's a one-year-old dog. Letting you pup go out and about will let it pick up information on how dogs behave. However, don't take your dog to a place where there's a chance of aggressive dogs picking on it. If you go to the beach keep your dog on a leash if there's other dogs there. Slowly trust your dog more and more and things should work out fine. If you go to a dog park put it in with the little dogs first and so on. Hope I helped!    =^..^=|`|aUAOHcoxaa	NO. he just needs to have had his vaccinations. your vet should have told ou when he could go out. he can definitely go to public places. "let him play " lol :)
07qFHL6iaa	Yah, your hamster is scared. Feed him by putting food in a bowl.   What you should try to do is take some unsalted sunflower seeds and hold it out to him. Be silent and patient and don't move. Let him come, notice you, and get used to your smell. Keep doing that for a while. Then start softly talking to him so he gets used to the sound of your voice. Talk to him whenever you are in the room or feeding him or giving him treats. Then you start putting in your whole hand, so to get the treats he has to climb onto your hands( remember to keep talking to him). DONT MOVE UNTILL HE GETS OFF. After he is fully comfortable with the treats on your hand, you put in your hands without treats... but don't lift him, or he will become scared again.  Good luck!|`|bGo7FfN3aa	give it treats.And talk to it softly.If he's not used to the sound of your voice or your smell then keep on giving it to him.Untill he i used to it,|`|ktVkRc3Raa	When I was younger and had a hamster, my hamster did the same thing so I asked my mother to take her out for me and she never was afraid of anyone every again.

PULTVzMhaa	Hello,    Unless you start seeing a red discharge from the nose or the eyes of your new babies everything should be good.  It just sounds like she needs more time to get used to you and her new surroundings.  She is not nocturnal like someone said.  Try to take her out and play with her to show her that you are not that scary.  If anything she does play the role of a friend for your other rat while you are away. :)|`|S9jyc95jaa	She might just be lazier than the other one. :)  With my two girl rats, I'm definitely discovering that rats can have vastly different personalities.  One of them loves to be held and played with, while the other one would really rather be left alone to explore.|`|FdnShJn9aa	Do you let them free-range? If yes, is Alice more active then? My boys sleep all day until I let them out, lol! All 7 of them...|`|Jg9I7ABOaa	she might be sick or lazy. i think she is sick since she sneezes.|`|EgGrKWjxaa	well either one isnt 3 months old or sometimes other rats are just more active, maybe they have different sleeping times ?|`|0vDLCa24aa	Rats and other small mammals are nocturnal. Maybe your rat is just sleepy ^^
IrdZKYT3aa	I definitely wouldn't add any more fish.  What's you water quality?  Is everything testing clean?  Any outbreak?  Any aggression?  If every ones getting along fine, the tanks healthy and the water quality is consistently good I'd leave it as is.  If anything is going wrong; fighting, disease, poor water quality, I'd go ahead and remove the rummies.

tPGxPDvBaa	It's dander not dandruff.  It is very common for puppies to have the flakes.  Brushing with a rubber brush is far more helpful than bathing.  The only thing you should be bathing her with is good puppy shampoo.  Never use ppl shampoo.  Waterless is fine to use but isn't going to remove the flakes only make her smell better.|`|80S8U7Edaa	Wal-Mart products are not gonna help your dog. Unfortunately, you get what you pay for!

Try something from here:    http://www.gingerpuplane.com/shop-dog-gr...|`|r9BXyz9zaa	well before you wash her with shampoo or have her groomed, I suggest that you see your vet. Yes, some dogs get dandruff, but usually not enough for you to openly notice it without looking deeply though their hairs. You may think it could just go away, and that's true, maybe it will. bUt, it could be a serious skin problem, in early stages that can be prevented by seeing a veterinarian.|`|Ei85kgfdaa	A high quality diet makes for a a healthy coat and skin. What are you feeding her?|`|Yu7y6yfraa	I would check out the diet first.  Make sure she is getting plenty of Omega-E Fatty Acids.  A good diet makes a major difference in a dog's coat.    Also, do not wash her too much.  It can dry her skin out and cause flaking.|`|FewhKlx9aa	Your dry shampoo is leaving a residue on her fur..I suggest a good brushing a couple times a day till you can safely bathe her..If it's warm where you are you can give her a bath now but if it's cold wait another month and make sure she is completely dry before you take her outside..Make sure you let her go to the bathroom before putting her in the sink though so she won't have the urge to go when you just take her out of the sink wet..|`|3LAF3XCFaa	Anything you buy for a pet at walmart is probably not good, not your fault you were probably mislead. Visit your local pet store and get an all nanaturalhampoo (tropiclean, avoderm, etc). Also, feeding a super premium food from the pet store will help with  the coat.
FgyE9Rthaa	Sorry, I am not a vet, just a concerned cat owner.  I have a cat that has had bad reaction to vaccines, also.  Did he mention why he thinks she stopped eating?  I would wonder if the tooth cleaning maybe made her mouth sore.  This wouldn't seem to be the reason for the antibiotics, though.  Good for you that you took her back for follow-up.  She evidently needed the meds and fluids.   I hope you kitty is better soon.  Make sure that you visit her.    Wed. night--Just checking:  How is your kitty?|`|JjMDvMJuaa	You are doing the right thing.  It may just be a coincidence that your cat got sick at the same time.  I have seen (I work at an animal hospital) that happen before where the Pet got sick after routine procedures and they were totally not related.|`|0vDLCa24aa	Every cat gets weird reactions everytime they come from the vet, give it some time so your cat get comfy. ^^
gM7VuCM4aa	Any of the over the counter stuff or drops do nothing to completely get rid of earmites. There is a all in one medication called Revolution that you can get at your vets without taking the cat in and having to pay for an office visit. Revolution treats fleas and earmites, even if your kitty doesn't have fleas, this stuff works the best on earmites. Don't waste your money on anything else. The Revolution is about $12-$15 and really works. The dose they give you will be dependant on the weight of the cat not age since your kitty is not a kitten anymore.|`|ea7ea4b520a9f40ac43ca5df6167b5daaa	There are medicines that are fairly cheap that you do not have to go to the vet for.  Alot of the bigger pet stores like PetCo, Pet Supplies Plus, and PetSmart will carry these items.  I rescued a cat last fall with earmites and purchase meds at Petsmart and it took care of the mites quickly.|`|0vDLCa24aa	Try taking your cat to a vet so the doctor can recommend something.|`|B8je4n5vaa	clean him/her's ears with ear wipes and do it lightly|`|31wmRjtAaa	Take him to the vet.  The earmite treatment is not expensive.  All you have to do is dip a q-tip in mineral oil and clean out all of the wax because the mites live in the wax.  Then, you just put a drop of the treatment in his ears and massage so it will go down further in the ear canal.|`|871f0e15f0d49545f27f78f43647edd3aa	I tried the OTC ear mite medicine and mineral oil. Sorry, these things did not work. You gotta go to the vet. They can prescribe a one-time treatment placed between the shoulder blades so you don't have to chase your cat down with ear mite medicine for a few weeks. It is so worth it. If you have taken your cat to the vet before, just call them and ask if you can buy Revolution for your cat's ear mites. Tell them how much your cat weighs and tell them you don't want to bring your cat in because you don't want to spread the ear mites to other animals, and the vet may prescribe something like Revolution for $13.00. You use it once and you're done. You'll save money because the home remedies don't work
CilhtOGGaa	German Shephards are a great breed, in fact my favorite.  I had one for 13 years.  They are very loyal, dedicated, fun and intelligent.      Possible health problems could be hip related, especially as the dog gets older.  You can get one from a realiable breeder (not a puppy mill) that has a better chance of not having that problem. Some will certify their dogs against the hip problem.    Most important about a German Shephard - they must be trained early, groomed and provided lots of regular exercise, or you can run into problems with temperment.  They are a working breed and love to be active.  You might want to talk to a local vet to find out the names of realiable responsible breeders and trainers in your area.      There is more information here about the breed at these sites:  http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepher...  http://www.akc.org/breeds/german_shepher...  http://www.loveyourdog.com/gsd.html|`|MGvN5xrNaa	German Shepard's can be great pets, as long as they are raised in a good home. They make good watch dogs and can be good companions.    One thing about German Shepard's, is that they can shed quite a bit! Make sure you're prepared for this.   Also, German Shepard's need plenty of exercise!    As far as health problems go, they don't really have too many, but one is that they could develop hip problems when old (other dogs can too).    Here's a website that you might find helpful:    http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/germanshephe...      As far as the cost, here's a website that sums it up pretty well:  http://www.familyresource.com/lifestyles...    (I think the cost of everything in here is a bit high, because it depends on the food you buy as well as the cost varying for a Vet, etc. But, it's a good estimate.)|`|fvwLFWqwaa	yes i have one tey are very loyal|`|LpsnLhVSaa	German Shepherds are great dogs and compainions. I own a german shepherd and she is super active. If you get one, make sure you walk her or do any form  of exercise for at least 1 hour. German shepherds eats a lot too so don't forget to feed her and constantly brush because they are little shedders!!! They are very loyal too so if you train them, they will listen very well! well food normally cost around $40-60 depending on the food you buy. I buy royal canin for like $50 and it lasts my dog about 2 months so it ain't too bad. For health problems, i think GS dogs are known for hip problems when they get older, but i don't think that should stop you from buying one. My dog is almost 4 years old and she is doing great! make sure you socialize with her...A LOT!|`|bAyid77qaa	A german shepherd is a very good dog to get. They are loyal, and great around family. Look at the following website... it will help you! =]    http://www.yourpurebredpuppy.com/reviews...|`|9IQBarkbaa	I have two German Shepherds ( a female and more recently a male one whose 6 months old). A female shepherd is way easier to train at least when you're a girl, cause male shepherds are really strong and you need to train them. So think about that.    I spend about 50 Euros on food for one dog each month, but that's not just dog pellets!!! It's also lots of treats and I buy lots of chicken too. Make sure you buy the right dog pellets to keep them healthy and to make sure he/she will live longer! I feed them Royal Canin pellets.    Also they're not allowed to walk stairs (not so much anyway till they're one year old), because they could get this hip disease. Also don't let them run so much when they're young.    You can give them vitamins, but take children's vitamins because they're not allowed to have too much iron (so make sure you take the right ones)! There are also vitamins that are good for their coat (you can ask this at a pet shop). It makes their coat glow!    German Shepherds are very loyal dogs! If you decide to buy a German shepherd let him/her interact with other dogs it's good for them and German Shepherds really love to train too and learn tricks like 'high five/crawl'.     Hope that helps you out a bit :)    And for more information:  http://www.dog-names.org.uk/german-sheph...|`|qrGLcTh4aa	German Shepard's are wonderful dogs. Do your homework before you adopt one. There are many German Shepard rescue groups where you can get one. They will know how much to feed him. Also, they require a lot of brushing to keep them from sheding so much.
IrdZKYT3aa	As babies, many of the other semi aggressive fish will do fine with them.  But as adults, and in a  45, not much.  Yes they will eat anything they can get in their mouth, so large fish are a good idea.  Perhaps if your kitty fish are babies you could get some tiger barbs to "grow up" with them.  They get about 4-5 inches around and they swim in schools.  I wouldn't thing that gets too big, as you'll be over stocked, but nothing that stays small.  Tiger barbs are aggressive enough to defend themselves, but usally leave bottom feeders alone.    Hope this helps!|`|2Zb0eNfeaa	Anything as long as they can't fit it into their mouths. If they can, they will try to eat it.|`|ur5wDhkMaa	As you know they are predators the only other thing is you don't want anything competing on the bottom with them. No other catfish species or omnivore plec's.|`|uWpwXn6paa	I have a 75 gallon tank with a pictus, a 4 line, 2 Bala Sharks, 2 Plecos ,a Columbian Black Tail Shark ( had 2 but one died ) a yellow Chiclid and a small blue whale. I have had these for over 4 years and had no problems. The Columbian Shark that died recently was 14 inches long as are the Balas and the other Shark, and Plecos.I feed them Frozen Brine Shrimp as well as flakes and algae pellets. Good luck and if your pictus is like mine you wont see it very much during daylight.
iIE0jQIKaa	She is fine,    "This subspecies seems to have very minimal food requirements, one of our healthy adult males may by choice eat only five or six times a year in some years; we've known adults to go half a year without eating and show no apparent weight loss."    This is an excerpt from the following care sheet written by "Tracy Barker".  The link is below:    Most likely she doesn't have adequate heat.  While they do like a heat lamp, it is important for them to have heat from the bottom of the cage.  Read the Care Sheet.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	i think they can fast for a long time.|`|nbGf6udUaa	snakes love the smell of bird. dip whatever u feed him in a can of chicken soup,and he will go nuts for it.|`|ZEDxoOa1aa	If you got the Kenyan Sand Boa the last 2 days ago you should let it settle in its own new cage and wait a week to feed it the right sized mouse.
IrdZKYT3aa	You should be fine adding another few fish, like tetras, but not the rubberlip pleco, they get about 5 inches in length and this would overstock you tank.  Betta are not the vicious fish people tend to think they are, they actually tend to interact well with most community fish.  As long as they aren't gourami's as they are related, or things like  a male guppy.  Things with long colorful fins can trigger an attack response, my two males reacted poorly to my males guppies but never touched my female guppies.  I'd beware of other tetras though, and watch these ones you have closely, tetra are known fin nippers and may attack the long finned and slow moving betta.  It seems your tank is balanced and healthy now, I'd leave off adding any other free swimming fish. Try otto cats instead, they are small sucker fish that stay about 1-1.5 inches.  I have a few of these in my 20 gallon and they do a wonderful job of cleaning everything.  Best of Luck!|`|AA11708471	neons need minimum schools of 6    with   a betta  6 tetras  3 G shrimp  and 2 ADF you are fully stocked    You dont need a snail  tanks require maintenance and scrubbing algae is just one of those jobs you should do|`|RepzNoRdaa	i think you should just leave it.   aww i used to have a few of the dwarf frogs! they are so cute haha.|`|fxH6T7vCaa	I wouldn't do that!

Consider getting a 15-gallon tank or moving either the shrimp or the frogs to their own tanks.  If you moved the shrimp or the frogs you could safely add 3 more neon tetras.
gM7VuCM4aa	Ideally it should be rubbed into the skin a bit, but as long as you got it in the right area it should be fine. It is given on the back of the neck because that's the only place a cat can't reach and lick it off.|`|2IOFXmQ2aa	Gravity will do most of the work for you.  Once the flea preventative is near the skin it will be absorbed into the cat's system.
1CKjNatxaa	o.O.. Well, try grass hay at first, if you ride her lightly, she shouldn't need more than that, if she has trouble keeping weight on, you can supplement some grain, preferably the health based grains than the sugar based grains. If you ride her a lot, you might want to switch her to alfalfa, though, do this gradually. What did her previous owners feed her? You have to take that into mind if you intend on a feed switch, if she was pasture fed, then grass hay will be the easiest for her to adjust to.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Start with hay.  if that isn't enough then add grain.|`|A3g0rrTXaa	I would contact your vet and/or an equine nutritionist. They can tell you better than anyone on here. You also need to take the amount of work she does, where she lives, her body type into consideration when deciding on feed.
nmzpdvkqaa	thats a BIG difference in snakes. if this is your first snake get a milk snake. but if you have experience with reptiles (mainly snakes) get a boa.|`|eSoU2C3Waa	for a first timer snake i'd say get a corn snake, if not get the milk snake.|`|rrFbQZzIaa	eh, it's tough to say. Milks are easy pets but that can be very finicky compared to some other snakes. Many times when young, and sometimes even into adulthood, they will musk or urinate on you when scared, they are more prone to biting than some other colubrids (king, corn snakes) and will sometimes be finicky eaters. This isn't all cases, but are just common problems. Now red tails get a little bigger than milks and their food is also bigger so b/c they require larger food, larger housing, more heating costs, etc, they more expensive than a milk. They also have a set of sharp teeth that can be painful if bit. For the most part red tails are easy going and will eat when food is given. It's up to you in what you're looking for in a snake.|`|X0Jkmx0Maa	i have 3 red tail boas, 2 emerald gree tree boas, 2 hypo salmon phase boas one is poss. super hypo, and 2 madagascar ground dumerils boas. dont know much about milks but my first snake was the rt boa and had since it was 22 inches she is now 9 1/2 ft. my other snakes are rt male is 6 ft my female hypo is 4 1/2 ft male hypo 3-4 ft dumerils male and female are just at 3ft my emeralds are new so they are babies male and female about 18-21inches. i breed rats and mice to save money the cost out of pocket is about 100-150 a month the rats cost the most becuz feed i do grow veggies and fruit but you can only grow so much. my there was a slight increase in electric bill but nothing really one snake will cost you about depending on size baby $2-$3week for feed yearling about 4-6 week if i were to buy for my 9 ft it would b about 10-15 a week to feed. i the bedding i get this bag from petsmart and petco both have it it a bag about four ft tall with pine bedding its about $15-$20 depending on store the size of the tank and how deep you make it will determine overall cost i spend for my current 9 snakes about $30-$45 month for bedding you can go to a lumber mill and ask them to collect it for you for free some people may or may not give to you i used to get it but new guy stopped it i would sift the shaving and get medium size stuff , too small can be inhaled to big can be painful. overall it up to you and for 1 snake the cost will small for general maitinence the setup of the housing is the most (the tank,heating,and humidity,thermotmeters etc.)costly  but only need to buy once may be a light bulb here and there.

A little terrier, for example, may be good for an active person who has older kids...   terriers do tend to be high strung, have a prey drive and sometimes can be nippy, so this wouldnt be a good choice for a less active person, or someone with very young children or small pets.      Snub nosed breeds like pugs and pekignese do not tolerate physical activity well.. these would be a poor choice of breed for an active person.. however they may be a good option for the person with the cats and kids.|`|VnrdIXnGaa	I would go with either a yorkie or maltese they're both so cute! i have a yorkie and hes 5 lbs and doesn't shed.|`|FewhKlx9aa	I think I have to say the pekingese.I have 10 little ones and I adore this little breed..They are smart and clean,they are little clowns they are spoiled and show that they are regal.They will sit by you when they want but have the attitude of I'm fine where I'm at..They are always there for you and always want to please..I think for a small dog and I have had shih tzu's,poodles, and yorkies,this is my favorite small dog|`|fdGITZ7daa	I would definitely say maltese!

I prefer males.. they tend to be more affectionate, while females tend to be more "moody".      Both are great pets tho if altered.  Some people prefer females because they think they are easier to housebreak, and associate behavoirs like humping and marking with males..  but females can hump and mark too!    Also, males tend to be more likely to display aggression towards other dogs, expecially to other males, but from my experience, females actually seem to be more aggressive in general than males!    Females do not have heat cycles if spayed.|`|699f5c40288010bb6118882150069328aa	I've had many a dog of either gender, and I can tell you with certainty that spayed female makes the best pet. Females don't pee on every bush (it's a myth that neutering a male will keep him from marking) and lamppost when out for a walk, which makes them easier to walk and take to the dogpark. They are better with children and are rarely aggressive, even arounfd other dogs. I think they adapt better to other pets, too.  Males have a one-track mind. Females don't. Enough said.|`|nI8G21y8aa	Both are great, mMales canbe larger for some breeds, and sometime more aggressive    females - have to worry aout them going in heat|`|YxGyd2yZaa	I honestly could not choose.

My female is spaded & she is more affectionate then my male, who tends to lift his leg a lot.|`|Z4eWbhZqaa	male theyre more tolerable|`|5MfZncDSaa	Male-- Female get their period as women.. so u dont wanna deal with that do you???|`|ExlhUudEaa	Male- females tend to get litters of puppies unless you want it sterolized which i think is unhumane and it also costs money to sterolize them.|`|b5c7f6bef65d4f3c4f8ebc309eccc08aaa	I've Had both (not at the same time though )   they are both great to own|`|r9BXyz9zaa	there is no good answer. to me,the personality supersedes the gender. But, many say that when males mark it leaves stains every where. Its a lie, just get your dog fixed and it will loose the desire to mark.|`|XF1ctbrkaa	I have all male dogs.. and wouldn't have it any other way..  they have more .. spirit.. not that females don't, but in schnauzers (the breed of 3 of mine), females tend to be polite and dainty.. while the males tend to be trouble-making clowns..  Even though they do get into trouble sometimes, they are fun to watch..      Mostly it's just an individual choice..  meet dogs of both genders and find the individual dog that clicks with you..  you may be surprised at which one it ends up being..  (I never set out looking for all male dogs, I met many dogs, and these are the ones that felt right)|`|UZZFZ8XYaa	female. because males tend to be more agressive than females. but the catch with females is that they have their time of the month!|`|29maScwJaa	A spayed female dog is the best to get. Much less aggression and less territorial behaviour.|`|tmckNa4baa	Both are great! Both genders r loving and caring or ur 2nd option is go with ur heart. Which dog would u like better? Take ur own opinion and not someone elses.|`|07qFHL6iaa	Depends what you're looking for in a dog.  Females are usually smaller but males are usually more playful. Males have a tendency to "mark their territories"  Just like humans, you really can't stereotype for dogs. When you go to the breeder or shelter ask for personality traits. Also, do breed Research and breeder Research.  hope that helps!|`|6cEwF2Vraa	Both are great. Just make sure you spay your female or neuter your male. The neutering of the male will minimize the possibility of hiking his leg in your house and dog fighting outside the home. Spaying your female will prevent bleeding every six months! Good luck!
kWwgWSSgaa	Puggles are cross bred dogs, not a breed.   Petite puggles, are just undersized dogs with an inflated price, again not a breed.    The breeder does not undertake to take the puppy back at any time during its life, should the purchasers circumstances change, waxes lyrical about her love for the puppies.    First come first served. The breeder is actively encouraging potential purchasers to pick the pup they want.  A good breeder will match the right puppy with the right home after assessing the litter.    This is a breeder to walk away from. You may want to consider either adopting a Puggle from a rescue or consider a purebred Pug from a responsible breeder.|`|PM23RDycaa	REPUTABLE breeders don't breed mutts.

They are Large scale bybs or a small time puppymill.|`|3giaPYe8aa	Not to be rude here, but the Amish are some of the biggest puppy millers of all.  Besides that, responsible breeders do not breed mutts on purpose and treat  dogs as a commodity.  Don't buy any dog off the internet.  These people are crooks and don't give a sh*t about dogs.|`|Bw18seFqaa	This is a puppy mill..   Amish are puppy millers..    There is also no such thing as a "puggle".. its a MUTT with a made up name.  NO reputable breeder breeds mutts.  Only back yard breeders and puppy millers breed mutts.      Try www.petfinder.com and find a pug/beagle mix at a local shelter or rescue.    Other clues that they are a miller..    they have at least 3 "breeds" available..  good breeders only have one, maybe 2 breeds.    They have a lot of puppies available..  reputable breeders do not breed that often, when they do, they only have 1-2 litters at a time, and they have a waiting list for those puppies.    They mentioned that they have black puggles, and called them "rare"..  NO color is "rare"..  and there is nothing "rare" about a mutt.|`|LWwGW48Daa	I dont know but Puggles are wonderful dogs!

Putting a fancy name on it will not change that.     I'm not sure what a puggle is, but since you want one I can assume you do know what a 'puggle' is composed of. I suggest going to a shelter and looking for a mutt that is part ____ and ____.
SzW9GmRsaa	Welcome to winter!    I know it's a crap suggestion ... but at this time of year a small holiday would be good for him.  There's nowhere to ride anyway!    Or, if you have transport, you could lorry up and go back to some of your old haunts..?  The world is your oyster if you have transport :)|`|A3g0rrTXaa	I'd use the water on the ground to my advantage. Take some time to work him on the ground and quietly under saddle until he at least tolerates the water.     When my barn gets to muddy to ride much I generally start working on things like:  flexing  turn on the forehand  turn on the haunches  halt/walk/halt transitions  walk/trot/walk transitions  halt/trot/halt transitions  trick training  hand walking on trails  riding bareback w/t  test how long you can trot w/o stirrups (correctly!)  test how long you can hold your two-point (correctly!)    it does get boring after awhile but thinking outside the box and reviewing/strengthening basic things is never a bad thing    EDIT: If the ground is wet, I WOULD NOT attempt anything above a trot. Its a good way to have a horse slip and fall. My friend was prepping for a show a couple days after it rained and hit a sloppy spot in the ring. Her horse lost its footing and she doesn't remember anything from that week.     Training barrels or poles isn't a bad idea if you keep it to the walk and trot until its dry out.|`|3a1e378691e31e4af23432441a473407aa	If you have someone else as a companion you could do more in the school, getting your pony used to water - check it first, I forced my horse into a puddle (well, I thought it was a puddle) but we both ended up having to swim for it!  He came out a lovely yellow colour!) - by getting the companion to walk in and out of the water with yours following.  Then try to walk in alone.  Give lots of praise when he does something right.    Can you get out to woods or open land via road work for more hacks?      I am glad that you and your horse are happier on this new yard despite lack of facilities.  A happy horse is the main thing.|`|3YHZUuhyaa	start jumping or barrel racing. it's soo much fun!!    good luck!!|`|b674gfUmaa	try walking hi through the water with all the tack on him and just lead him through it.    i would try Endurance riding (trail trials and trail rides)  it is a lot of fun!|`|9epC9nIaaa	if ur old yard is not to far away box up your pony and rider therre.        edit: there may b a charge
5atczOqzaa	no they usually do just find breeding.   the younger females have a little harder time on their first heat. but really if you are going to breed they need to be at least two and have had two heat cycles any ways for her health.    however with Doxies you want to make sure there is no inbreeding what so ever. If you have the female find a male out side your local area and take a look at the pedigree to know there is no relationship. inbreeding in doxies can cause shorter snouts and leg more health problems.    I bred Doxies both minnie and standard for a while. I only had one not take in all the time I was breeding. I also know three other Dachshund breeders that breed only Minnies and they have never had one not take. maybe it is just are area but we seem to have done just fine with breeding them (we no longer breed them)|`|QVP8zSuWaa	Nope any dog will breed. Should you? No. Unless you are an experienced breeder or have a breeding mentor there are many many dangers.|`|tmckNa4baa	Any dogs can breed i believe unless something happened or something?

If you and or people would Spay/Neuter their dogs, you wouldn't have to worry!|`|y5kz2ig3aa	No.    I believe in spaying or neutering a pet. Puppies are a lot of mess and work and if you are not interested in improving the breed which is an expensive thing to do since you would want to selectively breed a dog,  I have 2 both are spayed.|`|AA12168102	The Mini Dachshund breeder I know generally has to use artificial insemenation. I would not suggest breeding unless you have extensive experience in the show ring, with genetics, genetic disease, and have a lot of money to spend on vet care.  Breeding is not simple, nor lucrative.
1tOr2qLAaa	Most pet shops carry food that you feed babies with. It is a big responsibility if you start from the beginning you will have to feed every two hours. You buy the power and mix it with water and get it you exactly the right temp. Then you have to have a syringe and make sure you do it exactly right or you can kill them.  I hand fed 3 babies starting at about 3 wks, and as I said it is a big responsiblity. The food I think is Exact feeding power for babies. Make sure you do your research about handfeeding before you start. Everything has to be right.   Honestly with a little parakeet, I just wouldn't try it. If you decide to do it I wish you Good Luck.|`|zRXkkh0Maa	yes there is. You have to buy those that are meant for budgies.    Steps:  1. Mix a little amount of powder with warm water.  2. Make sure its not too hot.  3. Feed the babies with a spoon. Tilt the spoon a little, like feeding a little baby oats.   4. The best is to ask the vet or shopkeeper to show you if they know.|`|JMZkaf1jaa	Call a veterinarian as they would know.|`|FhVobWpeaa	do your parakeets have a nesting box?  if not then that is the reason the female did not sit on the eggs.  parakeets lay 1 egg every 2 days and start incubating as soon as the 1 st egg is laid.    hand feeding can be done but you would need to learn a lot before hand.  Incubating the eggs correctly is also a challenge.    BTW just because they mated does not mean the egg is fertile.  It has been known for 2 females to mate and have one lay eggs!!
EcKLqBnCaa	It might take a little while to get the milk flowing. Just let the kitten suck on a teat for a while, that might get it going. How do you know there is no milk though? There usually isn't a big flow of milk when they first give birth, at least from my experience with nursing animals. You probably won't be able to squeeze any/much of any milk out of a teat at first.     If there truly isn't any milk, you might want to take your cat and her babies to the vet. I know that women who don't lactate are given a hormone shot, but I don't know what the vet will do. If she ends up not having any milk throughout the nursing period, you'll have to buy some kitten milk replacement formula that you'll find in many grocery stores in the pet section. You'll have to bottle feed them for 5-6 weeks (they should start eating solid food around 5 weeks, but they still like to get their milk).|`|eDVzT3I8aa	Just leave them alone .. they will be fine.|`|AA10860594	call a vet then GET YOUR CAT SPAYED.

And get a very small bottle and some formula.   Then mix some water with the formula in the little bottle.  (There will be directions on the back of formula)  And then take the kitten and only give it a very small amount of milk but squeeze the bottle a little.  Then maybe you can save the kitten.

LwrVl2V0aa	That's a tough situation.  It ends up being where you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.    One point I'm not sure of.  If it comes down to it, are you able to take in the dogs yourself?    Depending upon what your relationship is with your neighbors, I would have a talk to them.  This can be a little tricky so you have to play it by ear as to how to approach them.      If you are able and would want to take the dogs, and of course, if these people are willing to give them up, that would be the ideal situation.  Then as soon as they are old enough you may be able to find them good homes.    Finally, about touching the dogs.  The fact that the mother brought the pups to you tells me that she trusts you.  Very, slowly and gently see if she will let you get close to them.  If she doesn't want you to, she will probably growl a little at first. That's your warning not to touch.  But I've got a feeling that it may be OK.    Good Luck.  If I could be of any more help let me know.|`|FPaJ1AU0aa	This is a really tough one!    First of all, I would take her and her pups to the vet!    After that, see if the vet can find them all good homes and tell the neighbours that you saw her running away.    Or    You could offer to buy her and her pups from your neighbours, and once the pups are of age to be sold, do so, and maybe keep the mother.    These are just suggestions though.|`|WDfWklRUaa	she is telling u that she does not want to live there anymore and fells safer with her pups at your place, the safty of her pups is her only reasoning at this point|`|BeoBwuuzaa	I would suggest you contact your local animal control. If you are willing to care for the mother and pups, be sure to tell them that. If they decide that the care is sub-par by your neighbors. They may be willing to seize the dogs, and sign them over to you.

Was the dog not leashed? Or not in it's own yard? Did you do anything to provoke the animal? If the dog wasn't leashed, or not in it's yard. It's the owners fault, not the dog's. And having the dog put down will only make you feel bad.|`|b09a95122fd9bc36dd862d2d74cf004faa	A big concern is if the dog has rabies. If the dog does, then you need to get shots.

Get a small amount of treats   a ball   a rope   a stick or other toy    Start with basic fetch: each time you throw the toy say the name ie Get the ball ...get the stick etc... when your puppy will fetch each of these objects on their own set two of them on them in a row in front of you and ask for the ball if he grabs the stick don't scold him point to the ball (tap it help him cheat a little) the second he gets it right make a huge deal over it and give him a treat after he gets the ball on his own ( this could take a day or a week or more be patient)   ask for the stick go through all the same manuvers whyen he can tell the difference between the two accuratley introduce the rope.... eventually you will be able to ask him to get anything it is a very convenient trick in the long run. Mine could bring every thing from my purse to a pencil. When you get this down let me know I will send you another one.

rrFbQZzIaa	You can give them away that very same day, but it wouldn't be suggested. You will want to get them started on eating and healthy and after 2 weeks-1 month, if they are looking good, you can start rehoming them.   Bearded dragons can reach sexual maturity at less than 1 year old but it really is best to only breed the females after 18 months of age as breeding a female too early can many times result in permanent or serious damage. The eggs take a lot of calcium out of the females system  You know if the female is pregnant b/c you will see her stomach get bigger and you will see bumps in the stomach. she will be eating a lot and when she's getting ready to lay, she will scratch the ground constantly. This is when you put a lay box in the cage.    this website shows a picture of a pregnant dragon: http://www.kingsnake.com/gladescs/bearde...|`|JiUKeyhGaa	uhhh probbably give them away at like a month old breeding like at 2 well she will sorta slow down and she will get fat and put ur hand at her chest barely push up and then slide ur and down if u ovals in her she is preggy
AXTUWKwcaa	1: Out of all the breeds of hammsters Ihave owned, my favortie breed is definately the teddy bear. They just seemed to have a better personality to me.    2: Any little cage setup kit you find at walmart or a pet store will work. Or you can you can use a tank with a mesh top on it. Just make sure you have a water bottle, food dish, wheel, and a little house or something for it to hide in. Hamsters also enjoy having things to climb into (paper towl rolls etc.) and things to chew on (preferably the little chew stick things). You will also need bedding. Every site you go on will say one type of bedding is bad and another will say the same type is the best. Just go with whatever you want. My personal favorite is pine.    3: Though my experiances with hamsters I recomend boys. They are usually nicer and you dont have that small chance of having baby hamsters (it can happen... trust me! ;])     When you go to pick out your hamster get one that is near the front of the cage that are kinda standing on the glass trying to get out. Those are usually the playful ones. Try to stay away from the sleeping ones in the back...     Best of luck with your hammie!|`|pfaddytkaa	idk bout hamsters but you should definitely name it Pansy :D    R.I.P PANSY...Frank killed you and blamed it on the mtv tech guy :(    hehhe|`|taYFAwlzaa	Ok im 14 and i have a syrian hamster. I think there more play ful. For a syrian id just recommend a aquariam( empty of course)  tank for those, you need a wheel, a ball for it, water bottle and a igloo, CHEW sticks and food.  I think you can get either one but they usually sell boys.   Additional info(:  - get only one syrian hamster. if you get 2 thell fight like roadkilll!  - pet stores are sometimes dumb on telling genders so dont be suprised if you take a pregnant girl when it sys boy  - when you buy it look if it is looking healthy(:|`|xyPpruSjaa	1. No hamster is playful. You will have to wake it up because they are nocturnal and awaken at about 12 am. Even then, they never really want to play. But they are good cuddlers. What I do is wear my sweatshirt backwards so the hood is facing toward the front of me, and put my hamster in there and snuggle up with him and watch TV or something. It's fun :D Oh and sometimes when I hold him, he climbs right up on my shoulder and then onto the back of my neck, then onto my back! It tickles SO much and it's really hard to get them off!    2. I really recommend a 10 or 20 gallon tank as their house. They're super easy to clean, easy to have access to your pet, escape proof, chew proof, and you can personalize them anyway you want instead of having that cheap looking ugly plastic sticking out in all directions like normal highly expensive garbage cages. Did you know that aquariums are cheaper than almost any cage you glanse at on the shelves? Except for those 20 dollar super tiny cages that are for people who don't know a thing about animals. 10 gallon with a lid = $22          20 gallon with a lid = $45 Prices may vary a little bit where you live. To hang a waterbottle in the aquarium, use some WHITE sticky backed velcro sold at hardware stores. Make sure you have tons of toys and chew toys for them. The best bedding is Sunseed Freshworld bedding from petsmart. It looks SO good and it does great on odor control.    It really doesn't matter. If you're squeemish at seeing the boy's testicles, then I suggest female. Although most pet stores don't even sell female animals except for mice and rats. They're both just as cute, but I imagine the female will be more playful and active.

[8] bedding is necessary  [9] they are fast, keep an eye on them when uncaged  [10] DO NOT KICK THE HAMSTERS BALL ACCIDENTALLY they will have a heart attack and die  [11] don't have more than 3 people looking and playing with it at one time because they get nervous and can have a heart attack  [12] don't let small children play with it unsupervised (my cousin did this, the kid dropped the hamster and it died of a heart attack)  [13] if it gets too nervous too often they get wet tail (hamster diarrhea) and you will need to get a medicine at petsmart or they will die  [14] hamsters can get fleas, if they get fleas there is a spray at petsmart (they will not die, but they may start balding)    My mom won't let me have a hamster so I spend a lot of time with my cousin Rachels dwarf snow hamster Princess. She's fat :)    Name: ...Smokey? :)  boy hamsters are hard to get just letting you know.  Good luck!|`|aEQWHUcWaa	you should  get a syrain hamster and sure get a boy it depends where you get it. For the gender anyway you should name it buy how it acts. I named my roo becasue when he walk he sort of jumps so roo became his name.

A Syrian hamster. They are the bigger ones. I have a teddy bear hamster, he is very playful. He hasn't bit me once. But whether or not your hamster is playful can also largely depend on how you take care of it and treat it. If it is always dirty and you are always grabbing at it and flinging it around then it won't like you.     2. Wire cage with a solid bottom, easy for cleaning. You can also get the cages with all the tubes, but those aren't necessary and they are hard to clean and put together and can break and the hamster can get stuck and die.    3. Get a boy because the girls can get stinky when they are in like heat.|`|ourL0HdGaa	1. Get A Syrian Hamster, there a lot more playfull and active.  2. A Wheel, Food Dish, WoodChippings, Bedding, Water Bottel And Tubes.  3. Boys Are More Playfull, But Girls Are Boring.    All hamsters love to live there own life and not keep being pested and woken up during the day, this could cause a quick death due to stress.    Please be carefull with hamsters care !|`|krqfJViEaa	1. If you're interested in holding and cuddling your hamster, a syrian (teddy bear, blackbear, panda, normal) hamster would be best as they are the biggest and slowest type of hamster. (Robovorski would be an unrecommended choice because they are fast and are the breed that loves to run around) Dwarfs are also fine but Syrians are slower.    2. Crittertrail and Habitrail are recommended. Wired cages are also great because it has great air circulation for your hamster. Definitely get tubes for your hamster. (You can also make them from paper towel rolls) Chew toys to trim their constantly growing teeth. A wheel for their daily exercise. (You can also get them a run-about ball if you like.) A home, bedding (Carefresh is the best since it soaks in liquids and is odor-free) You can also add other toys to your liking. Since this is just for their entertainment.     3. Well it is SAID that males are calmer than females and less observant and that females are more aggressive and bite. But it just mostly depends on the personality of the hamster and if it trusts you or not. Dont worry just love and take care of it, and all hamsters will be affectionate towards you. So feel free to choose a male or female hamster as you like.    Be very patient with your hamster and dont stick your hand in the cage or hold your hamster until about a week. This is so your hamster can get used to its new environment.     Hope I helped and good luck with your hamster! :)|`|NMfASONTaa	There are dwarf hamsters, and syrian hamsters. If you get a SYRIAN you CAN ONLY HAVE ONE HAMSTER, but to me....they seem to be more friendly. With dwarf hamsters, you can have more than one but, they mainly socialize with their hamster buddy. So I recomend you get a teddy bear hamster/syrian.    When you buy a cage MAKE SURE ITS FOR HAMSTERS. I got a mouse cage once, and it realy hurt my hammy. I recomend the   "critter trail" cages, or an aquarium tank. If you get a wired cage make sure the bottom of it is plastic, hamsters can hurt themseves from walking on wire. No matter which cage you get, put bedding, and replace the bedding every two weeks.    When you go to your pet store, you cant realy choose the sex, and it doesn't realy matter anyways. If you can choose I would get a girl.    as for toys You have to get a hamster ball, they LOVE those. They allow them to have fun around the house without getting hurt.  http://www.petsmart.com/product/index.js...  This may also help  http://www.pgaa.com/burrow/general/hamst...  I hope you love your Hammy. (:|`|LooXLfoDaa	Syrian Hamster is best.    I would get him an exercise wheel (without spokes), a running ball, chew sticks, and a few tubes for him to run through.    Get a boy, they're less hassle and more playful.|`|LzcTwj7kaa	I would get a girl becuase boys when you pick up you can feel the testicles. which i think its gross  umm i reccomened critter trail    and chinese dwarf hamster      people say that they are mean but i own 3 and they are like any other hamster im not saying there better im saying there equal|`|QOw2M6pZaa	I named my hamster Mikey lol.
tPGxPDvBaa	it's fairly common for the breed. Cuz they do have large soulful eyes & tend to have eye injuries & problems with their tear ducts.  Other than vet making sure the dog doesn't have infections or something irritating the eyes, there isn't anything I know of to stop it.  Part of owning a basset.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	Look into Angels Eyes.  Ask your vet about it.  It is a powder you put on  the dogs food to help with this.  Your vet can get you some, or you can buy it elsewhere, I just don't know if it is right for your dog.  Ask your vet.
YCvgjLdnaa	It is most likely to be a terrotorial thing, which is popular in almost all animals. It could be playing, however it is most probably serious, so you should keep an eye on them and if you notice anything seperate them.  You said that you were playing with them and when you put him back in the other one fights him. This is probably because of "your scent" and so if one of them smells of you then they fight. Try to handle them both at the same time.  Make sure they are both either male/female. I had what i thought were two boys and they were babies they were what i thought was fighting, a month later lots of babies =I....   Just keep an eye on them and seperate if you see anything serious. once youve seperated them dont put them back together! as they will fight seriously and will not go back.. good luck xxx|`|deU903Iqaa	mating? maybe there not men. or they are young just testing out there sexuality|`|07qFHL6iaa	Rats r territorial. THey're both boys aren't they.

y8HyP1bzaa	Oh gosh... don't do ANYTHING involving q-tips and her personal space!  That sounds like downright animal abuse.    Just wait it out until you can get her fixed.  Nothing else you can really do.|`|9f97f8a980cb5aa7360577720efbdd70aa	Just get her spayed as soon as possible..call the vet and set up the appt. for it now.  Do NOT let her have one litter first like someone here is suggesting..that is absolutely uneccessary and irresponsible..there are millions of cats euthanized each day just in the US alone.|`|9G03aQhsaa	I would not try the q-tip thing...you might hurt her....so no, there really is nothing you can do, her behavior is instinctive and hormonally driven.  Try getting her to play, maybe you can tire her out so you have some quiet for a few hours, but that's about it.|`|AA10860594	Just get her spayed asap. don't do anything involving the Qtip, that's kind of grosse.|`|FJciPjcgaa	The only way your cat can be calmed is when she either mates or goes out of season. That is why the best way to avoid these uncomfortable periods for you and your cat is to have your female cat spayed. Spayed cats won't come into heat and spaying your cat can save you much trouble in the future. Spaying your cat can also prevent medical problems such as uterine infections or breast cancer.     If your cat is a pedigreed breeder or for some reason you don't wish to spay her, you can take her to vet when she is in heat for hormonal injections or medication. These hormones will stop your cat from coming into estrus.     Female cats can be spayed almost any time from as young as 6 months. It is not advisable to spay your cat while she is in heat, because of complications that may arise.     Be warned - if you do not spay your female cat, she will come into heat several times every season!|`|B2UcglG1aa	Don't do that! In fact, don't get her fixed! My cat was a little weird too on heat, but eventually after about nine months it was worth it! Let her have ONE litter of kittens, THEN get her fixed. That way, she can have one lot of Mini-hers that she can love until they are old enough to give away, then she should get fixed. That's what we did for our cat!

uo2sGuvWaa	Here is a basic care sheet, at the bottom is a website with more in depth care and diet requirements. Good luck.    Diet-  45% leafy greens such as collards, mustards, dandelion, kale. NO lettuces or spinach.  45% hard vegetables such as orange flesh squash(butternut, spaghetti,acorn pumpkin), fresh green beans, fresh peas, green bell peppers, parsnips.No Broccoli.  10% fruit such as figs, mangoes, papaya, pears.  Do not feed animal protein and commercial Iguana food it is very unhealthy.    Lighting-  They need a UV light(ex. reptisun 5.0 or greater I use 10.0) They need to be changed every 6-8 months.    Heat-  Basking spot 90 degrees F the rest of the tank should be 75-80. Get a digital thermometer to measure the temperatures.    They need humidity so you should spray them few times per day. You should also give it a bath every other day in warm water.    This website has everything you need to know about Igs.    http://www.anapsid.org/iguana/      EDIT- This was posted by justme lori    About 5-10% of their diet should be broccoli (cooked and cooled), fresh cabbage (red or white) and spinach.    I give mine eggs or cheese about once a week.(about 10-15% of it's diet)   You can use a hamster water bottle from a pet store.      Never feed your Igs Eggs(animal protien), cheese(dairy), broccoli(high in phosphorus), cabbage or spinach(high in phosphorus). You want your Igs diet to be high in calcium and low in phosphorus. The website I gave you gives detailed list of these veggies and greens. And give your Ig a water bowl big enough for him to soak in, a water bottle is not going to work well for a reptile and most will never touch it.  Igs need a lot of water.and humidity if they become dehydrated it will start to effect their kidneys. Kidney failure is one of the leading causes in Iguana deaths along with improper diets.|`|Su0JYynbaa	Your eating iguanas?  AHH!  sorry, that was mean... I don't really know much about iguanas, but maybe... you can find some sites about iguana diets?  lemme check...  http://www.greenigsociety.org/feedingigs...  this one looks cool!  I hope this helps!|`|bKwQyCEHaa	Cut up pieces of carrots, bananas, collard greens not sure i have bearded dragons but you can read this below :] I hope this helps!        http://www.greenigsociety.org/feedingigs...|`|raJETLfRaa	most fresh greens and some fruit is ok for iguanas.  stay away from broccoli and banana, because banana is mushy, it can stick around mouths and cause mouth rot  make sure all food pieces are the same size as the mouth otherwise it will be difficult to eat.|`|FI0ckE7eaa	I have a 5 1/2 foot free roam Green Tree Iguana.  He likes fresh mango, mixed green salads (I use an Italian or spring mix), turnip leaves, cantaloupes(without skin), and romaine.  About 5-10% of their diet should be broccoli (cooked and cooled), fresh cabbage (red or white) and spinach.  Also some fresh berries.  Don't worry, if it doesn't like it, it won't eat it.  You do not state how old the iguana is.  This is a diet for an iguana that is more than around 8 weeks.  They are pure vegetarians.  Babies need meat in their diet and fresh veggies are really too tough for them to chew and/or digest.  Also, be sure your iguana has plenty of fresh water.  You can use a hamster water bottle from a pet store.  I could go on and on about how to feed and raise them.  This is my 3rd free roamer.  I love them.  They don't bark, but they are very affectionate if raised right.  Anyway, back to the subject.  BE CERTAIN your iguana has a sufficient amount of calcium in it's diet, otherwise the jaw will grow improperly making it difficult if not impossible for it to eat.  I give mine eggs or cheese about once a week.(about 10-15% of it's diet)  Also be absolutely certain it is getting about 8-10 hours of some type of sunlight so it will develop properly.  If you handle it, remember this:  After your iguana has been in "sunlight" for more than 3 hours, they get a bit crabby.  The longer it basks, sometimes the crabbier it will become if you go to pick it up.  My advise, pick them up before they bask, pet them afterward and be patient and kind.  If you or anyone else has more questions about iguana, ask away.  I will try to help you out as much as possible. P.S. I take mine for walks too. Enjoy!|`|hFgXi9cSaa	summer squash butter squash granded carrots turnip greens kale mustard geens    banana apple peach mixed berry's (not a whole lot) dates plum    bell pepper green bean butter bean lima beans peas  asparagus     pumkin tofu
kmREy0Mwaa	Heya. When I was younger I too had mice. They are very cute and small. I had 2 boys. They never bit me or never hurt me in anyway. I think they are great pets. We kept them in a cage but one of them escaped. He went missing for about 2 days and then we finally found him in a dress pocket in our wardrobe. Tehy were very sweet and I would totally reccomend them.    I would say what you have is a slight fear because they did bite you and I dont blame you, but I think they are overall good.    I hope i helped you and good luck in the furture. xx|`|GVNkffLXaa	I think you should get rats. I know people think mice are cuter, but they bite, stink and normally run away from people. Ratties on the other hand, can be toilet trained, taught tricks, do NOT stink and are far more cuddly. But all rodents are different, you might find a perfectly sociable mouse. Im not trying to change your mind but I think you'll have more fun with rats. I have two little fuzlets called ebony and matilda and that are 5 weeks old and they already come when they're called.    here are some great websites that will tell you more about them    www.evergreenrattery.com   www.dapper.com.au  and you can also google them    Whatever you decide have fun with your new pets! :D|`|AA11027952	My sister had 1 when we were kids and to this day she still loves that mouse (long gone of course).  She played w/ her's everyday.  Just handle it, keep it's "home" clean (that will help w/ any smells), and I guess they make good pets.   I do remember it had accidents on people, but so do alot of pets :)|`|07qFHL6iaa	My mouse didn't last very long but she was sweet and playful but they can be sneaky. I never noticed stench but her wheel was loud!|`|YCvgjLdnaa	Lol yes, they do stink, even if you do regularly clean them out, but there are sprays you can buy (mice friendly obviously) to solve that. They are great pets, that dont require much looking after. Your mice  probably bit you because they were not tame, however if you socialise with them then they should not bite you and they make great pets and are very fun when tame.  My experience, I have two (named Billie and Ollie    p.s. lol yours werent mean, just untame... and they are fun, as long as they are tame xxx
Wo0AWgYVaa	There are a few things you need to do.  First, I want to ask you have you done any formal leadership training with Molly...I am not talking about just on playing tricks, sit and down type.  It's about establishing who is the pack leader in the family, eg. you eat first, Lily eats first, then she eats last...you get out the door first then the dog...walking beside you, not in front...when you said Leave It...will she leave it, or just ignore it...<br>  This won't solve the problem alone, but it will set the foundation.  So if you have not, tried enroll a professional to help you.  So you can get result faster.<br>  <br>  Then you need to be vigilant all the time.  Molly does not just attack animals (who she thinks in lower ranking than her), she also bites you..which is an indication that you are not above her.  So there is chance that she could out of the blue snap at a child.  So never let her to be alone with other animals or people.<br>  <br>  Then it's about disciplining at the right moment.  Dogs have very short attention span.  So let's say she bites Lily, you spends few minutes making sure Lily is OK..then you lock Molly inside a room...Molly cannot associate the lock in = result of biting Lily.  You need to do it right at that moment.  I may even put a gentle leader/haltie on her...because this collar gives you more control handling a bigger dog.  <br>  <br>  Net net is re-investing time in training and really don't give her any option of getting it off easy.  BUT very importantly, don't use physical discipline..there is a recent study done that dogs being trained in dominant training methods become more aggressive...so tactics such as alpha roll, hitting, pinning the dog down is not recommended.  <br>  <br>  My method of timeout is very easy.   I have a leash in each floor.  When the dog acts up, I grab it..put the leash to his collar...take it to a door...use the handle of the leash to loop to the door knob at the inside side...close the door so the door snap the leash in place (your dog is on the outside side)...So the dog will fight and pull and bark in the first few mins...totally ignore it...wait till he is calm down and quiet..then release him.  Also for using gentle leader as discipline in outdoor...what you did is pull the leash up, this will automatically get the dog in a sit position and the haltie will close its mouth so the dog can't bite you.  Hold on to this position till the dog calms down, when it is calm, then gently pet her and say easy easy easy...<br>  <br>  I did enough that when my dog gets too excited, I just need to hold his neck area gently and automatically he will sit down and try to calm himself down...<br>  <br>  Hope this helps....If people give you negative commands, ignore it.  My trainer re train dogs that will go after your throat and all got adopted.  Her pit bull is so well trained that the dog will go to his bed on command.<br>  <br>  Don't give up, get a good trainer and work with you.  Some dogs will get more dominant.  It's not their faults but you need to learn how to work with this type of personality...|`|O6SXFnRaaa	biting is NEVER ok. look in to obedience school and a muzzle. then socialize her on a leash with the muzzle and a firm no when she shows any aggressive type behavior a tug on the leash will reinforce the message. be consistent and stop this behavior now before it gets out of hand|`|euwbbibZaa	well she is still young enough to be trained. the only thing I can think of asking is if she has been in heat yet. My youngest do is the first one I have had in heat and the day before she started she got in a fight with one of my other dogs and left my other dog shocked and shaking. They got along fine like an hour later but if she is on her first heat or could be starting soon. Their hormones go wild. Hopefully that is why the out of the blue aggression came from. If not you need a trainer and soon that specializes in aggression. Hope everything gets fixed!|`|kixQWODVaa	you should find a local trainer.  she could easily become dangerous(im not saying she is im saying she could be) but with the right training she will be fine.  The way you got onto her was fine as long as you did not get too aggressive|`|vIYGV1C7aa	I agree with the poster above, it sounds like the pup thinks she is the boss and not you.  I would also suggest getting the dog into obedience class classes as soon as you can, but that won't solve all the issues.<br>  <br>  The pup has two VERY active and intelligent breeds inside it and needs plenty of exercise.  If she doesn't get all of her energy out, then she will find ways to do so, usually in unwanted ways.  And putting her into isolation only adds more energy instead of releasing it.<br>  <br>  Take her for long walks both in the morning and again at night.  This should drain some of that pent up energy and if you can complete a proper walk, will also reestablish you as the leader.  Also, since she has Border Collie in her, she has a strong work drive in her, so find things for her to do throughout the day.  Be it fetching things for you, or have her do things for you.  I have trained my GSD to get me water, pick up items that I have dropped and even help my wife with the laundry.  This may sound weird to some, but I'm telling you, she loves it...sometimes too much, lol.<br>  <br>  To make a short answer as long as possible, get her into some classes, take her on long walks and if that isn't quite enough, then find productive things for her to do.  Most of all though, you need to find a way to reestablish yourself as the leader.  Doing the above can do that, but only if you do them in a calm but firm manner.  When I say firm, I don't mean by hitting or screaming (especially since dogs have better hearing than we do, so screaming doesn't really help matters), but by being consistent and only rewarding the good behavior.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|wz9szz3Gaa	She is trying to show who is the Alpha this is seen early on when there is more than one dog. I know you are right by isolating her to her cage.A dominant dog knows what he wants, and sets out to get it, any way he can. Again you don't want to use the cage as punishment you want her to like it as a home I had a dog like this.<br>  She's got charm, lots of it. When that doesn't work, she's got persistence with a capital "P." And when all else fails her, she's got attitude. There is hope, however Dominant dogs may be small or large. A small dog with an assertive personality can be just as possessive, protective and pushy as any large dog of the same temperament. Do not tolerate aggressive behavior from either of them. Small or large, a growl or snap is likely to lead to a bite. Small or large dogs that bite are dangerous. <br>  <br>   Dominant dogs may be subtle in their manipulation of you. When you stop stroking the dog, she may nudge you to continue. If you resume the stoking in response to the nudging, she has successfully trained you to treat her as the leader. Assertive dogs take compliance to mean they have the right to make you obey them. They nudge, you stroke, they growl, you resume stroking. It is one small step to growling at you when you try to make them get off the couch, followed by snapping when you insist they obey. <br>  <br>  Living with a dominant assertive dog doesn’t mean you can't let your dog sleep on the couch or have him in your lap when you stroke him.  It just means you need to be very aware of how the dog is interpreting your actions.  You need to learn the dog's language.  You also need to learn about leadership, so that you can be in charge instead of a dog calling the shots, if you are in charge, you have the right to allow the dog on the couch and also to make him get off the couch when you want. Two things help make a positive relationship with a dominant dog. The first is obedience training and the second is to establish you as the pack leader.  Establishing oneself as the pack leader and to be followed. Good luck keep working with her.|`|L22hVXTIaa	That's a very young dog to be showing such aggressive tendencies - especially grabbing your hand after being reprimanded - but you shouldn't have hit her!  Never hit a dog.  Could be that her Border Collie background kicked in during the pig incident.  Since she is a herder, she was probably trying to herd the pig, and often (if they're not trained properly) a herding dog will nip the sheep, or whatever they're herding to get them to move along.  Obviously, Molly got a little over zealous with the pig.  And, as to the puppy, she was letting the puppy know she was done playing (which is something older or more dominant dogs do) but, again, she went a little too far.   I would suggest getting a professional trainer for Molly and for yourself so that he/she can show you the proper way to discipline a dog and evaluate Molly.  Good luck!|`|0IMf5SATaa	You need to find yourself a good behaviourist to work with you and your dog. At her age she could be growling as part of play, my jack russell does and the behaviourist can tell you whether your dog is being truly aggressive. However, drawing blood is not a good thing, whether she just doesn't know her own strength or is being aggressive and she needs to learn it's wrong. <br>  You know that you shouldn't have hit her, though it's understandable, when something like that happens, it can be shocking, causing you to react badly. Hitting her teaches her that physical violence is ok. <br>  <br>  When she does something like this you have to react immediately, very sternly say 'NO' and take her directly outside (which it sounds like you are doing). There is no point isolating her for more than about 10 minutes because she'll just become frustrated and forget why she is there. You need to show her that you are in charge and won't stand for behaviour like that. Always praise her when she is being good and playing nicely.<br>  Find a behaviourist/trainer who uses reward based training, never use one who endorses hitting or choke chains. Reward based training is far more reliable and allows you to build a better relationship with your dog. The trainer will also be able to help you to learn what her different behaviours mean, taking into consideration body language as well as the noises she makes.<br>  <br>  Loads of exercise is always essential as part of your training. A tired dog is a happy dog and more likely to be well behaved, though of course labs at this age are always full of beans.<br>  <br>  Please don't bring a baby into your house until you have this problem well and truly under control.<br>  Good luck|`|AA10327148	This program needs to be applied *consistently* to your pup><br>  NON- CONFRONTATIONAL DOMINANCE PROGRAM (or "no free lunch") <br>  <a href="http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/training.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pitbullsontheweb.com/petbull/...</a><br>  You should see immediate results.<br>  <br>  Your dog is just now coming into her maturity, and seeking her place in the family.

She will be happiest when you fulfill your role of leadership.<br>  <br>  All that she will learn from smacking, is that " might makes right", and it will only increase the severity of her bite!|`|AoSeHXeQaa	It sounds to me like Molly has decided that she is the boss, and it is her job to discipline everyone in the house (including YOU).<br>  <br>  This is not acceptable behavior, and can definitely be dangerous.<br>  <br>  You need to get with a trainer who can show you how to take control, and discipline your dog effectively.|`|sXVkRGJIaa	Ok first of all I want to say DO NOT  DO NOT  DO NOT kill it. I know someone who killed a dog today and in my opinion its one of the cruelest things to do (and the dog was harmless).<br>  I was going to say bring her to an obedience class they might be able to offer some help but if your not planning on keeping it then please give it to a shelter.
ixFbNr4taa	The Kennel Club (of the United Kingdom) is what originally "classified" the Terrier Group.  At their founding, they artificially set up a list of purebred dogs what roughly corresponded to a "job".  And not surprisingly for that time period (1873)  they were Anglo-centric -- and therefore Miniature Schnauzer being of German origin AND being bred down from Working/Herding Schnauzer stock -- obviously did not meet the criteria to be in the Terrier Group.      When the breed was introduced to America, the AKC chose to assign  the dog to THEIR Group according its' function (a barnyard ratter and above ground vermin catcher).  So in the USA, the Mini Schnauzer is considered a terrier although clearly it is not -- it's ancestor (the standard schnauzer) is in the Working group.    There is the definition of the Terrier Group as the Kennel Club defines them today:        "Dogs originally bred and used for hunting vermin.  'Terrier' comes from the Latin word Terra, meaning earth.  This hardy collection of dogs were selectively bred to be extremely brave and tough, and to pursue fox, badger, rat and otter (to name but a few) above and below ground.  Dogs of terrier type have been known here since ancient times, and as early as the Middle Ages, these game little dogs were portrayed by writers, and painters.  It is commonly believed that the British Isles are the origin of most terriers.  Originally, these game canines were bred to best fit the purpose of which they were used, and looks did not particularly matter.  Nowadays however, thanks to the efforts of breeders over the decades, the terriers have become attractive, whilst still retaining jovial, comical and in some cases fiery temperaments.      Obviously this categorization is subjective or lacks clearly-defined parameters....but that is what lets the Kennel Club be flexible when a new breed from another country is introduced.      So, you could try a Papillon in there and it would met the criteria.  But, it is not English-bred and hunting is not it's original purpose.  Fails!    Same with the Dachshund - German-bred and it hunts by scent and Blood both above and below the ground.  They are also used to flush game for falcons nowadays as well!  The Dachshund DOES give voice (I would not call it a bay) but it can call out as it is tracking rabbit, deer or boar.  Fails the terrier test.  The Boston Terrier - bred from terriers but its' original purpose was for dog-fights (not hunting vermin) and then it morphed into a companion dog.  So while it is called a terrier - it is classified as part of the Non-Sporting Group by the AKC and the Utility Group by the KC.    I think that the Terrier Group definition is more what a dog breed fails to be rather than what it is.  I am sure that there are a ton of english-origin, hunting dogs who will attempt to catch game both above and below ground ...but until you see them, watch them, hunt them and understand the breed -- you don't "know" if they are a terrier or not strictly on a paper description.    It's like that famous line from Supreme Court Justice Stewart Potter -- "I know it when I see it!"....except he was talking about Obscenity and not Terriers.  :)|`|P8Q39vA4aa	The Bosten Terrier is not a terrier at all, never were. Its just in their name. Much like the Australian Shepherd which are NOT from Australia.     Schnauzers were not bred to go into ground they were bred as above ground ratters.     The Min pins are not terriers either they are a toy breed dog.  They were used as open field ratters never set foot underground    Dachshunds are not terriers they are hound dogs. The do go into the ground but that does not make them terriers. They were also open field dogs chasing rabbits and badgers, then followed them under ground    Terrier comes from terra which means ground which most terriers do, but NOT all. It also refers to there FEISTY attitudes.    I think you need to get your facts straight there.     NO not all terriers are from the british isles but the majority is.    EDIT- If you cant get that answer then you are an idiot, its plain and simple what terriers are they are ratters that went underground, it doesnt matter where they are from. Like I also said it REFERS TO THERE ATTITUDES.|`|tPGxPDvBaa	Terriers are class of dogs set by each kennel club governing body as which breeds fit it's requirements to in the Terrier group.  The group is consists of breeds that were used for hunting vermin.  Different breed clubs recognize different breeds in the Terrier group.    Schnauzer for some clubs are in the Utility class not Terriers.  Just having terrier in the name doesn't make it part of terrier group.  Yorkies & bostons are companion dogs not hunters.  Doxies are in the hound group. They bay & seek out game which terriers do not bay.|`|vPde97E2aa	Schnauzers were *NOT* bred to go-to-ground after FORMIDABLE QUARRY!!! Merely barnyard ratters!    Neither were MinPins! which are TOYS.    Neither were Bostons,-NON-SPORTING! They slid in along w/the BULLY breeds,which are NOT real terriers either!    GOOD dachs CAN hunt/work the EXACT same quarry as the true working terriers...& *DO*!   Plus their "hound" work above ground!    AHEM......no dog in the world goes in-ground & KILLS BADGERS!!! NONE ,NEVER, NO WAY!!!
FJciPjcgaa	All female cats (or queens) that have not been spayed will come in heat (or estrus) at stages in their lives. This may happen from as young as the age of 4 months and recur seasonally (usually summer seasons with more daylight). The cat stays in heat for normally 4-6 days and during the summer season will come in heat again every 2-3 weeks. These periods may vary widely. The cat will come out of heat and the cycles will end once the cat has mated or the season ends. After giving birth a female cat may come in heat again in as soon as 7 days although this usually happens after about 4 weeks.|`|uBFhKXgHaa	Until you do the responsible thing and have her spayed for her health.     Darksong~|`|9G03aQhsaa	Cycles are different from cat to cat.  For mine, it was two weeks of heat behavior, meowing, "presenting" loss of appatite, three weeks off heat, then right back to it.  It really never ends.|`|jW3apvpVaa	once a cat comes into heat they are pretty much always in heat.    they will be officially in heat for 3 days to 3 weeks. if not breed they will go back into heat a few days to a week later. the only exception to this is if it it winter, when the cat may not want to raise kittens. (but some do, so beware)    if your not planning on breeding her, get her fixed. females in heat are unhappy and sometimes develop tumors and cancer if not bred.    good luck.  :)    p.s im not a "omg get your cat fixed, the world is overpopulated, your cruel, ect" types of people. i just know how hard it is on both you and the cat when shes in heat. :P    p.s.s did you know a cat can get pregnant whether its in heat or not because they are manual ovulators? bet you didn't ;)
5I7MZjHuaa	Baths  Although a rare bunny may grow up swimming in the family pool and going on camping trips where she paddles around in the lake, the vast majority of rabbits, like their ancestors, do not relish getting wet. Even an occasional bath is quite stressful to the average rabbit, and is not recommended.  NEVER--unless your veterinarian advises it to bring down a fever--should you give a sick rabbit a bath. Because seemingly healthy rabbits can have undiagnosed problems, it's best not to subject them to the stress of a bath. If your rabbit is very badly infested with fleas, there's a good chance that he is already compromised and may go into shock when bathed. There are many safe alternatives to flea control (see these under "Fleas," above). Also, a thoroughly wet rabbit takes a very long time to dry, so spot cleaning the dirty area with an application of baby cornstarch (available at any supermarket in the baby section) (do not use talcum, as it is carcinogenic) and then gently combing out the dirt with a fine flea comb is better than a wet bath.  A wet rabbit can quickly become hypothermic. If your rabbit is wet to the skin for any reason, be sure to thoroughly blow dry the bunny until even the undercoat is dry and fluffy. Normal rabbit body temperature ranges from 101oF - 103oF. Because rabbit skin is very delicate, and rabbits are sensitive to heat, never use a blow dryer on a setting higher than "warm," and constantly monitor the temperature of the air on the bunny's skin by placing your hand in its path.|`|47R03TbFaa	You sure can give your bunny a bath just don't get water in the ears and make sure you take and dry them very very well so they don't get a chill  and shampoo you need to either talk to your vet or the pet shop nearest you .|`|jyGTlpzTaa	Lop rabbits are no different from any other rabbit. Generally they dont appreciate being bathed, they will kick and struggle and get very stressed out. You also have to be careful to dry them right, it is difficult and takes ages to get the undercoat dry because their coats are so thick. Unless the rabbit is filthy, I'd avoid it. You would use small animal shampoo.|`|BlpJnZOoaa	go to pets mart they give bunny shampoo|`|CGkgsjVbaa	Yes! :) i would not do it if the rabbit is living out i would maybe leave it till summer. or leave him instead untill 100% dry    if indoor then yes i do mine. just make sure u brush him every hour after or they get knotty!
3giaPYe8aa	If he won't go in on his own, pick him up, put him in the crate, lock door.  THE END  You don't have to "stuff" him in or use your foot to jam him in, just put him in. There is no cruelty here.  You are the boss, not the dog!  I do however suggest that you "could" give him a treat when putting him in.  This "can" make the learning process go a little quicker.  Also, tell him what he is doing, so, in the future when you say "go to bed" or "go in the crate", he will know what you are talking about.  Same as teaching a dog to sit, you don't just push his but down, you have to give him the command so he associates the two things together.|`|8tJPK69iaa	I trained my puppies by giving them a treat every time I told then to go in and they did on their own.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	Enticing is better.  An enticed puppy thinks it is nice to be snuggled up in his crate with his warm bed & toys.  A stuffed one is either dead or will howl lots.|`|Vcb2kWbwaa	no yo!!!!|`|pHLTGduoaa	If you want your dog to actually LIKE going into the crate, you shouldn't just throw them in there and shut the door. They will see that as punishment, and never want to go in there. Just leave the crate out, with the door open and put treats in there. Then when the dog goes in there, give him or her a lot of praise. Then start feeding him or her in there so they see it as a good place to be. Then, move onto closing the door later down the line. It is definitely well worth the time and effort to have a crate trained dog. My dog loves hers.|`|exny4cOwaa	Yes thats the way to do it when your dog is a puppy, but make sure you guide him in with a treat, or a chew toy, then leave him some things to play with, and if it's possible some music or the TV playing in the background so that he doesn't feel lonely.|`|eZiOe9kFaa	BETTER TO THROW A TREAT/TOY IN AND WHEN HE FOLLOWS CLOSE THE DOOR|`|AA11992723	the crate should always be positive, and i dont think any dog should be "stuffed" anywhere..
jyGTlpzTaa	People who are truly "Animal rights" are against usage or ownership in any way. They believe people should have no contact with animals whatsoeer...so animal farming, hunting and pet keeping wouldnt exist. You get people who jump on the peta bandwagon who dont realise what they actually stand for. These people really need to have a good look at what animal rights actually means.|`|ZbnVjxQOaa	Animals do not have rights. Illegal aliens do not have rights, space aliens do not have rights, only citizens have rights.    When is the last time  a runaway dog was drug into court? His master is because they are chattel. That is a term from English Common law, upon which all our law is based.    Look up "chattel", that pertains to all domesticated animals.
2d4ba6b7cd6c6a7bc081ea3fa55f00c4aa	Hello!    Sorry to read about your cat, yes, they always get ill at the weekend! Sometimes the vomit looks a lot because dry cat food  swells up in the stomach. Perhaps you could give her smaller amounts several times in the day, if you think that she is eating too much at once! Try feeding her something light like scrambled egg or finely cut up cooked chicken or boiled white fish, cook it in water and don't add salt These are all gentle on the stomach. Make sure that she has plenty of water near to the food. For the next couple of days just watch what she eats, even though she vomits she may have enough food in her stomach to nourish her. Let me know how you get on.  Good luck|`|C1Cobi1taa	it might be the type of food.... my cat threw up meow mix and other cheap cat foods.... might try switching her food?

FewhKlx9aa	Sounds like your already attached to these 2 shelter dogs..Is this the first time you have done this??? I'm just asking because you are asking for advice and if you had done this already you would know what to do.I'm sure you will give them a good home|`|AA10112346	high quality food?    good for you. :)|`|GSf09ALBaa	I'm a little late, been out walking my Pit.  Got some aggression issues towards other dogs on the walks.  Halti collar working okay.      Alright, a foster person!  Been doing this for about three years.  Since I have a pack of dogs I make introductions in my front yard which is neutral area before going into the home and back yard.  But I don't think you have a pack so introductions should go pretty smoothly.    The best thing I have learned from fostering is to give them space.  Let them explore a bit but still keep some order.  It is truly amazing to me how most of them respond to your lifestyle and schedule quickly.  I have had some that were so emotionally scared it took weeks, though.    So, just give them some space and exercise.  Don't give too much lead way with the obedience and boundaries.  And of course, affection.    And bless you for fostering.|`|eDAX46b9aa	Give them lots of attention, and be gentle. If they've been abused in previous homes, the might think that you will hit them when you go to pet them. Treat them as you would a regular pet; nicely. Respect the dogs as if they are human, and allow them to spend time on their own, while supervising them. I hope these dogs have an enjoyable time at your home. Good luck!|`|paaozogGaa	good for you for helping the dogs!  I myself just adopted a matted up schnauzer poodle mix yesterday!  I felt so bad for it!|`|eDySIDPQaa	To make them feel welcome in a new home, you just have to first let them explore the entire place.    just show them lots of love, attention, patience, you cant force any dog to love you, but they should pickup on the fact you are caring for them and that you love them.    it will take time, good luck, they will come around and you will love them so much..so dont try to rush it, they will back off from you.|`|7tsVGmAEaa	Give them lots of affection if you want :)    They will settle in anyway just as we settle in to a hotel say :)|`|foancrNEaa	i know you know this already but have you ever thought of adopting them yourself because you do not want to get attached  to them and then have to give them away|`|nY2hZrUMaa	just give the lots of T.L.C, hugs andd kisses and that  a hot water bottle or two and lots of blankets  mabye an old pair of sock to chew on ;)    dnt get to atatched to the or you'll want to give them!  good luck to all of you!!!     give them a hug frm me!!  xx|`|0id6jchSaa	omggg!!! i have an american stafforshire  lol  well i'll tell u wat my dog likes  my dog like lots of stuffed animals, he likes u to tug on them and chase him around  also labs and stafforshire's like to run alot. you should take them running around a park or something atleast twice a week  my dog goes to the beach for an hour every day  he's very active...  mmm labs and staffs usually like water alot too. so if you live near a lake, or ocean you should take them there  i think you should let them be around your room  and usually their very friendly and easy to get along with people, so you should be fine.|`|FQmZLqMdaa	I would get a large crate or two so that when you are out they cannot damage your house.  A crate would also mean that they feel secure when alone in the house.  You will need to monitor their food intake & how long it takes for it to be digested, you will have the odd accident you always do with puppies.  I would also ive them something of yours so they can smell you when you are out & a radio or tv for company so they dont suffer from anxiety separation when they first arrive.  The best thing you can give them is lots of love, playtime & attention.  Good Luck.  You won't want to part with them.|`|Oxaaqm1maa	when you bring them home take them to their area and pet them hug them talk to them so they get  used to your voice and stay with them for a while because those dogs are in a strange place and dont know the smells and whats there, its also good to take them around the house and yard on a leash to get them used to whats around hope this helps! good luck!|`|KYYJyi0Uaa	Buy them food and mats for them(to do their business) and if you want you can also buy them clothes for dogs. bottles for them to drink water, a little tub so that you can give them a shower.

Not only do they love it but they get sleepy when later in the day which means more time to relax. You can make them homemade dog treats ( my dog loves when i make them). You can even have a fun day in the house with them. It will make you get to know them and they will get to know them. Show them that you are there to love them and be their friend.     Hope i helped  Good luck with the puppies  and most of all thanks for caring about if they were in shelters or not.    p.s. you need to show me a pic of them|`|48r36oJBaa	there's nothing you can really do to make a dog love you immediately, just treat them well and give them lots of attention and they'll be happy|`|upSUC0oeaa	i think it is soooooo nice that your fostering them i do the same thing at my place the best way to make them feel welcome it just to give them as much love as possible. and to play with them . also you might want to start training them it makes them easyer to fine new homes for them.
EHF8yYwCaa	If/when I am seeking out a trainer, I'm looking for someone to help me train for some level of competition/working.  Obedience, Schutzhund, Agility, Herding, Hunting, whatever.  As others said, I'd look for someone who specializes in that field, and is accustomed to working breeds *similar* to mine, in similar disciplines.  I would not take a high drive Malinois to an AKC Obedience trial trainer who has nothing but Goldens, and expect her to train with me in Schutzhund obedience work, for example.      I'd want to see titles on the trainer's dogs, and titles on her *student's* dogs as well.  There are very skilled & knowledgeable "dog trainers" who are great at training their own dogs, but are lousy TEACHERS.  Since working with a trainer means the HUMAN is the one being taught how to teach the dog....the trainer must have proven people-teaching skills, if that makes sense.      Breed makes a difference if there is a drastic contrast between each breeds' "style".  If I had an Aussie I was training to herd, I wouldn't even bat an eye at working with a BC trainer.  However, if (when!) I get a Beauceron, should I decide to try herding, I'd want to find a trainer who is accustomed to training "continental" herding dogs; as their working style is vastly different than BC's, Aussies, etc.  Same goes for if I lost my marbles one day & decided to have a go with Basenjis in the Obedience ring....I would try to find a trainer who had successfully worked Sighthounds or Primitive breeds in the Obed ring, not a Golden Retriever person.      I absolutely would not just "go for it" and hope for the best.  Bad training can downright RUIN a dog, requiring weeks, if not months, of work to "un-do" what went wrong.  I have had that experience ONCE.  Never again.  Maybe it's a chance you can take when trying to teach a dog not to jump on the furniture...if you can screw that up, you don't need to train IVY much less a dog.  But when you're talking bitework, herding, field work....even Obed/Agility, you're asking for a more intense, mentally demanding level of work from the dog.  Push a dog too far, too fast, or use the wrong method and you'll be weeks, months fixing that mistake.  Not a chance I'm willing to take.      IMO it's the trainers who cater to the "manners/behavior problems" crowd people need to watch out for.  Like the Petsmart trainers, and many of the Yellow Pages yahoos; some of these folks have a 6 week vo-tech course and they're calling themselves dog trainers.  Ask for details on their education.  Apprenticeships.  References.  How many training seminars have they attended recently?  Whose?   Never needed (and probably won't ever need) to hire a trainer for basic manners/behavior issues, but if I did, that's what I'd be asking.|`|342b3711423c978836fa192cef3238d8aa	In my opinion, the trainer needs to have titles on his/her own dogs as well as having students who have had some success.      But more than that, I want a trainer whose methods I agree with.  I just spent the past week checking out obedience classes and quite frankly, the class I ended up picking for my puppy, I knew within 2 minutes that this trainer was the one for me because of her positive, upbeat attitude with the puppies.  I didn't even have to ask her if she'd ever heard of Patricia McConnell, Ian Dunbar or Jean Donaldson - you knew she did after watching her for 2 minutes.    To me, their breed doesn't make a difference, but I would like them to have experience with my group at least because herding dogs, for example, are very different from terriers or sporting dogs.  And while I've been working with dogs for long enough to be able to train my own dog, no one can train their own dog if they're going on to competition obedience - the dog needs the experience working in a building with lots of distractions.|`|1399ad3bbdc56a8d68fc6ce5430a21ffaa	I was a dog trainer for Petco for about three months.  During that time, I realized I had nowhere near the experience I needed to do the job I was doing, so I went back to being just a grooming assistant.    Right now, I help my mom's friend out with training her dog, but it is all basic positive reinforcement work- stuff I am familiar with.  I won't help anyone else train their dogs because I don't know enough yet- and won't for awhile.    For me, I look at the title a trainer has on their dogs, combined with their interaction with my dogs and explanation to me about what it is that they do.  My favorite trainer lives about an hour away from me, but has fantastic dogs and is worth the drive.    As for breed- I strongly prefer trainers with herding breeds, but as my trainer shows and breeds Vizslas, I guess sometimes you have to give a little.|`|vPde97E2aa	There is NO "certifying" body...organization...group.    The PROOF is in the dogs TITLED by the individual.    Know who"certifies" the "trainers"(gag) at Pet-NOT-Smart? I do;I asked. "The head office"...that means NOBODY! Any boob-off-the-street can declare themselves a "trainer"!!|`|hbj6vGE4aa	In my opinion, it is all in the success of their trainees.  They need to also have titled dogs in their expertise.  Yes, in my opinion, that includes obedience titles.  Herding, agility, field work, hunting, conformation, anything else, they *must* have titled dogs.      AND they must have students who have titled dogs as well.  This proves to me that not only do they know their stuff, but that they can adequately pass on their knowledge in a way that beginner can grasp.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	I would want a different trainer for different types of training.    I would like my next Dobermann b*tch to be trained in the sport of Schutzhund, so I would join a schutzhund club & work with someone who had years of relevant experience training dogs.    For training for open/championship shows, I would want a trainer who had experience of showing dog & had titled them.    If in competition obedience, an experience trainer/titled dogs in that field.    I would want a professional dog trainer, who had enough years of practical experience working with dogs to draw on, to be able to assess a dog. A trainer who understood the canine mind/importance of genetics & could offer plainly spoken constructive advice.     All too many dog trainers take a course, lack knowledge based on years of experience working with dogs & are of no real practical assistance.    Canine behaviourist? Well, if there are any good ones, like locating a decent professional dog trainer, it's a case of finding a needle in a haystack.|`|4rwouQHOaa	You are absolutely right, anyone can just show up and train and anyone can take a 4 week (or however long it takes) course in petsmart and become a dog trainer. I therefore need to see proof, I don't want to/won't take the risk of a trainer ruining my dog. Titles and experience (including experience with my breed and specific area of training), good references and student success are what I look for. As well as a trainer who will look beyond their own views and opinions - and will use what ever works best for MY dog!!!     "Are they capable?" - The majority of self-proclaimed trainers cannot figure out how to potty train their own dogs, let alone train someone else's.    Great question!!!    Add: I think "Ginbail ?" bought up an excellent point in regards to communication.|`|KxjUim7yaa	I have always trained my own dogs. No one knows them like I do. They are bonded to me and I am qualified to train them. I have potty trained dogs and have dogs that come on command, I can take them out and have friends over.I used to show in AKC shows and know how to groom my breed and stack them for a judge.    However, for the owners that are clueless about all this, I think they need to go to classes to have someone show them how it is done.|`|WDfWklRUaa	there is only one answer, REFFERENCES|`|66c4680772e4326cd1f9687e39ff7f56aa	I know several people who have put obedience titles on their dogs, who I wouldn't mind training with, but I really don't think they'd make good teachers. It's not that they don't know what to do, but I don't believe they can communicate well with other people. The best teachers are the best communicators, and well experienced at training dogs. They aren't so stubborn about specific training methods, and they understand  that different dog-handler teams need a tailored approach to training.|`|Xa9esMTEaa	I'd say that about (and I'm serious, not exaggerating) 90% of the dog trainers in the United States and the UK aren't competent trainers at all. They cause problems for real trainers because they've filled dog owner's heads with useless mumbo jumbo that makes sense if you squint really hard at it when it's upside down and backward. If you're looking for a trainer in a specific area (protection, schutzhund, agility, herding) then yes, that person should have titled dogs, or have owned and trained titled dogs at one time. How can I train a Schutzhund dog for you/help you train your own Schutzhund dog when I myself have no experience in the sport? If there was a greater understanding of common sense dog training among the common person there wouldn't be as many phonies capable of passing themselves off as dog trainers. Time outs don't work, Positive Reinforcement Only training (petsmart/victoria stillwell style training...but at least petsmart doesn't put dogs in time out), treats, smiles and hugs don't solve aggression (heavy corrections do), and Negative Reinforcement Only training doesn't work...well actually it does work, but your dog will hate you so don't do it. 80% of the trainers out there are petsmart yuppy treats will train a dog to do anything type trainers who advise you put a dog down when it barks at the neighbor, 10% are the Negative Reinforcement only trainers who get your dog out of your sight and do the old school William Koehler yank and crank style submission training, and the other 10% are trainers with common sense who understand training as a whole from obedience to correcting behavior problems (most of these people are or have been influenced by Ringsport/Schutzhund/Police Dog trainers...but even a great number of protection sport trainers aren't worth a red indian cent). Advice to the wise: Buyer Beware.    Edit: I'd also like to say that the reason protection sport trainers are so well rounded is because they've gotten their knowledge from some of the greatest European trainers ever. Also they have dogs that MUST perform...if your agility dog misses a tunnel, oh well, better luck next time...but, if your police dog doesn't bite a suspect, you could be dead...|`|AA11026827	As an aspiring dog trainer, I'll tell you what I plan to do to make myself look more credible.    I'm currently getting a bachelor's degree in animal science (my mom's wish).  I plan to attend a dog training academy in Texas to learn how to be train for certain types of training.  I then plan to officially get certified, I believe through the Association of Pet Dog trainers.  I currently have already been training puppies and dogs for a nearby GSD breeder that I know well.  I train the puppies and prepare them to go home.  I also train the breeding dogs, mostly basic obedience, but also stacking and gaiting.    I plan to own and operate my own dog training facility.  I also plan to foster and train dogs for any and all local rescues/shelters (pro bono) so that they have a better chance of getting adopted.    Personally I have a knack for training, and have yet to meet an animal that doesn't listen to or respect me.  It's something about me that I honestly can't explain.  Anyone who has doubted me at first has reconsidered once they see my personal dog and how well trained and mannered he is (he is also CGC and TDI certified).  I'm already active and experienced in conformation showing.  I plan to get my dog into agility and obedience competitions.  I'm very good at training (not trying to brag), and it shows in every dog that I've ever worked with.  I've helped the breeder raise litters, and I can walk amongst the breeding dogs and the ones I raised instantly follow me and listen to me.    I'm going with a career that goes with my talents and true abilities.  It'll take a little bit to prove it to people and get myself established, but I can and will make it with natural talent and training.  The certifications, college degree, and training should help, and show that I'm proven.    In my mind I'm trying to do as much as I can to be a trainer that people will find qualified.|`|5d0588fa97d047676b038c38ba3e0cd3aa	As others have already stated, it depends on what you want the dog to do as to which trainer you go for.     If you want a dog to compete in a particular sport - go to somebody who has had success in that sport.    If you want a dog to do a particular job - go to somebody who has already trained dogs to do that job successfully.    If all you want is for your pet to be a pleasant companion though - how do you pick the right one? Personally, I'd go for one that's registered with APDT.    http://www.apdt.co.uk/    The Kennel Club also have a Canine Good Citizen Scheme:    http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/dogtrain...    Many of the apdt trainers do KC Good Citizen - and I don't doubt that many non-apdt trainers do that too.    Also remember that training isn't something that's ever finished - it's something that's ongoing (although the form of training should change) throughout a dog's life.|`|0x0IWeHbaa	Yes breed makes a difference!  Some breeds show the same traits and problems in training. I have a young border collie in agility that shows the same problems or learning styles as many other BC's.    I also believe you should find a person that has titled dogs which equals experience and with many dogs and breeds or at least the breed you trying to train. I needed evidence, I watched his classes and watched him compete to know if he was qualified.    This trainer has owned many border collies in his 77 years, and still competes! Many of his students also.    I was once told about training a Border Collie, "It's like doing a crossword puzzle in ink, you better make sure you get it right the first time."

(We always assumed a male had abused her.)  Now my husband is her best friend-so hang in there and just keep working w/ her.  Good luck.|`|XGHLrOklaa	Someone has obviously beat her when she has been eating.|`|eoZJO3J8aa	she wants you to beg her..
3BMBZtDxaa	Don't listen to the person who said that they're just dust collectors, us real dog people know what you mean! They're prized possessions and we love showing them off and looking at them before we go to bed thinking about how wonderful are dogs are and how amazing it is that you can work with another species to earn them. It really makes you feel like you accomplished something and makes you feel happy and more at peace. Well, at least for me!<br>  <br>  Anyways, the cork board thing was a good idea. What I've seen is people dedicating a wall to all their ribbons and they put them up on the cork boards or they tape them up (depending on what size ribbon it is). My friend competes in horse shows and does the same thing. All her ribbons are up on a wall and she leaves that wall specifically for her ribbons so they all fit! <br>  <br>  Good luck and have fun!|`|kqa9VFrfaa	When U R young ribbons are fun. So when U run out of door space, U can start putting them around the upper walls of your room like a decorative boarder. They should be lightweight enough to hang up with small hooks or that poster putty. Can someone put up a nice looking strip of wood around the walls for U? <br>  Also a tall narrow revolving rack can be used. Sometimes display racks from book stores or the thrift stores can work for this purpose as well. Consider a basement or garage display. People with barns put their horse ribbons there sometimes, up on a bulletin board. Congratulations for enjoying your dog.|`|6SeWCfUfaa	I like a cork board that's not glued to the wall.  I like them because you can use itty bitty pins to keep the ribbons on the board and you can move the ribbons around when you get new ones very easily and without tearing up your ribbons.  So long as it's a free hanging cork board, you can also move the entire thing with you if you move or something, without messing up your ribbons.<br>  <br>  And ... if you totally run out of space, you can always get another cork board and do up another wall!  :D<br>  <br>  And Kelli, some of us still have enthusiasm for what we do and aren't all burned out and bitter.|`|GaL66jbQaa	sew them together like a quilt and hang it up like a tapestry|`|DWLbXd79aa	well a friend who won alot horseback riding she had a pin board on her door covered with them, but she also had them all over her wall, and after like the whole wall was covered it was really creepy, i'd say jusy keep the door thing, and have ur favs up, also take ur fav of the favs and use it as a tassle thing and hang it from your rear view mirror in your car, thats origanal i've never seen that before, i sea the graduation tassle all the time, but never any award ribbon, congrats by the way on ur athleticism|`|qapJU3tMaa	This is a site for asking questions about DOGS.

pd5rERcfaa	I can see how this would be frustrating.    Try something like this: "My husband and I make household decisions together, and if his cat allergies were bad enough we wouldn't have agreed upon getting another cat."  That way you can let people know you make choices together while also expressing you put a lot of thought into getting another cat.    Hope this helps!|`|mzIEfCYQaa	I agree.  You're married to your husband and not your family (or his).  My sister has horrible allergies and she and her husband have a huge fluffy cat and a dog with long hair.  She takes allergy shots and loves her animals as if they were her kids.  No one has the right to say anything to you... and when they do, tell them that it's your choice and they need to respect that it's your choice.  Good Luck!  :)|`|B2UcglG1aa	If you are having issues just TELL people why and that it's not JUST cats.

Since he's allergic to other things, the cat shouldn't be the one to get the "blame", and NEITHER SHOULD YOU!!    Has he tried Zyrtec, Clariton, etc.......for his allergies?  There are also shots that can be taken to alleviate the allergic reactions to certain things........."desensitization"........    If people want to "press the issue", just tell them it's "not up for discussion" and turn away.  People will try to "get in your face" about things that they think they know all about, but if you turn and walk away..........NO FACE TO GET INTO!!    Good luck at the party!  Maybe, your husband would like to try one of the allergy meds, and see if they work for him.  I know allergies are frustrating, so if one would help.....????    Hope this helps......|`|FQyeGsIyaa	First off, don't let these rude people get to you.  You know it was a joint decision and that you and your husband are actively working to manage his allergies.  Whatever anyone else thinks or says doesn't matter.  Don't play their blame game.      I'm the one in our house who is seriously allergic to the cat (and dust) and take 3 prescription medications a day.  The nicer comments I get are along the lines of "Are you nuts?"  The simple answer to that is yes!  My husband tells people the agreement was we'd keep the cat if we could manage my allergies and some days are better than others but we're doing fine thank you very much.

YpEswTQdaa	Okay.    Type: Albino=Red Eye White,for correct term,if he has Red/Ruby coloured eyes. Or Blue eye white,if he has blue eyes! =)    Do NOT feed him 'Ice-Berg' lettuce,as its high in a Substance that can become toxic,if fed often,also it can be a Sedative! Other lettuces,such as Cos & Lambs lettuce are suitable to feed often.    Carrots shouldn't really be fed as a meal,as they are high in Natural Sugars,similar with Raisins. Coriander is fine,but Spinach,has a similar affect to Ice-Berg Lettuce.    Is it possible you CAN order Rabbit Food? Ideally he needs a Mix or Pellets,for Rabbits. As he may become Malnutritioned.Plus Hay is essential,it should make up to 90% of a Rabbits diet,even more important than Pellets!    Hope this helps,xxx|`|5I7MZjHuaa	Please take a look at this link, it has the best rabbit diet info you can find    http://www.rabbit.org/faq/sections/diet....    Hay is absolutely necessary for healthy teeth and G.I tract, please try and get hold of some.  Pellets don't matter as much, they sould only be given in tiny quantaties anyway, and many rabbits are very healthy without them.|`|CTVkz71aaa	any vegetable matter is good. if you cook broccoli give your bunny the stalk to chew on. any veggie scraps are good especially cabbages and leafy greens. there isn't too much nutrition in lettuce but nuts and seeds (like sunflower) are good too. you can also feed your rabbit rolled oats or any other whole grain.|`|BlpJnZOoaa	your only supposd them certain treats its bad what yor givin him! try spinach also dont feed him lettuce he likes but too much is bad and carrots diarea raise chewy spinach good i have a bunny but we have a nearby store|`|Vfc1UGnwaa	Sadly this is not the right diet, it is unhealthy to feed them just vegetables and fruits, if you have a farming store, such as Agway near you, you can get rabbit pellets( i know Agway has them), but you should get timothy hay, it is very good for rabbits and necessary for their good digestive health.  You might have to order online, or maybe you could buy supplies from your friend.  It is healthy to feed them fruits and veggies daily as supplements.  If you have a super market they usually have a pet isle with rabbit food.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	If you absolutely cannot get rabbit pellets and timothy hay near you then you probably shouldn't have a rabbit.  It isn't really fair to him.  He needs to have the hay for proper digestion.  If you want to keep him you should suck it up and just order some food online.  In the meantime, you can feed him oats.  They are really good for rabbits and can help a lot with their digestion.  Just make sure that you get the old-fashioned rolled oats and not quick-oats.    Leafy greens are also good for your rabbit.  Give him things like spinach, radicchio, carrot tops, and bok choy.  Do NOT feed him iceberg lettuce.  Do not feed other fruits and vegetable regularly.  These should only be treats and given sparingly.      (F.Y.I- albino is not a type, it is just a lack of pigment)|`|PQRcItmdaa	Ask a vet or someone at a pet shop. Don't trust what your friends or people online say. You want to make sure that your rabbit is healthy and on the right diet.
AA10139925	Sounds as if she might have had a slight reaction to the shot, but then again it could be coincidental. She could be suffering from allergies. If she seem normal in other ways, eating, sleeping, etc. then wait till you can talk with the vet.  It's possible she just caught a cold too. Otherwise, there's not much you can do but wait and see.  They may have you give her some kind of anti-histamines for pets.|`|P6LZR2eZaa	I would say that it is probably frm the flu shot.      However, I found this on the internet, hope this helps:    Probably conjunctivitis, or inflammation of the mucous membrane of the eye, is the commonest visual trouble with cats. It may come from an attack of distemper or start with catarrh, or it may be caused by smoke, or dust, or poisonous gases. Sometimes both eyes are affected, sometimes only one. There is redness and a swollen look, and the sufferer weeps tears which presently become a discharge that excoriates the skin and leaves bald spots unless you promptly wipe it away. Often the cornea looks quite opaque. Mild conjunctivitis can be relieved by bathing the eyes with a warm solution of boric acid and water and keeping the cat from the light. Of course she will try to scratch the affected parts, and of course this must be prevented. There are little wire eye guards for the purpose, but a light bandage will serve.    There is a purulent conjunctivitis which attacks kittens, and, less often, cats. It is a painful malady, with a thick discharge, and sometimes blindness follows. The eyes of young kittens should be carefully looked to for signs of congenital disease, though to be sure this does not often occur. A kitten's eyes should open when it is nine days old, but in rare instances, as I have already said, nature must be aided by gentle rubbing and bathing, or possibly an operation.    It could also be a blocked tear duct or just common allergies. Every spring, my cat's eyes will water because he has allergies and there is nothing we can really do about it.     However, on Monday, it is best you take your cat to the vet. Hope this helps!|`|FFbWgs0Xaa	I have the eye watering problem everyday with one of my persians.  I wipe the area with a wet tissue then a dry tissue to make him more comfortable.  I have never heard of it being a side affect of a vaccination but check with the vet.  When my cat's eyes get very bad the vet gives it a anti-inflametory pain-killing injection which has an almost immediate effect and then some crean to put on the eye twice a day.      If they eyes get so puffy they are hard to open then it is an emergency and the cat will need to see the area's emergency vet (details probably on your vet's answerphone message).  Otherwise just keep wiping the eye and take the cat to the vet when it is next open.|`|tU4UZlKjaa	like the others said its probably the shot but i would keep a really close eye on her to make sure... good luck and i hope she gets better.|`|LNsxHiCaaa	GET THE F()CK OFF YOU COMPUTER AND BRING UR CAT TO THE VET!!!!!!!!!!!

u61yKsE3aa	Clemmys guttata also known as American spotted pond turtle is full grown at 3-5 inches  Also most mud turtles only reach 5 inches some are larger though.  Any of these turtles will eat fish so you will want to house them separately and the still need a decent sized tank as well as filters and lights (Heat and UV) Good Luck    In regards to salmonella they do not Always carry it.  Salmonella in turtles is carried through the feces a clean tank and turtle is rare to spread salmonella but as a precaution you should always wash your hands after handling people who claim they always carry it are just fueling the fire and are misinformed.|`|cB5aBE0Eaa	Have you seen those forty gallon "Breeder tanks"? You could house a turtle in there. A good one would be a musk or razorback musk. The turtles you often see at petstores, red eared sliders, need  a larger tank.

It's been a few years since I've read up on them, and I know they tend to be a tad more peaceful then regular JD's.  And, I recall an issue with them being fairly sensitive, and something was wiping them out once they hit a certain age.      If you have  breeding pair of GT's, that may be an issue as well.  Most cichlids turn into little monsters during breeding time.      And the flowerhorn, well, just depends on it's temperament.      I would not recommend adding an oscar or any other fish to that set up.  And, an oscar would not stand much of chance with those fish.  Oscars are really one of the more peaceful of cichlids.  They just get a bad rap because they eat everything and anything that'll fit into their mouths.    I would definitely move the JD out, and then just monitor the other 3 in the tank.  Have a back up tank/plan ready in case you do need to separate.  Good luck!|`|qEp9fxU9aa	You will eventually end up with 1 Flowerhorn or 1 Green Terror.  These are aggressive territorial fish and 4' isn't enough territory for them.  If the green terrors decide to breed then nothing else is going to live in there.  The Oscar will be in as much trouble as the Jack Dempsey.  The minimum size aquarium for 2 of any of the breeds you are considering is 75 gallons.  If you know you have all males or all females you may do alright for awhile with 1 of each of these breeds though the day is coming when you wake up and find all but 1 fish dead.  If you don't find this in time then other dead fish will pollute the tank and they'll all be dead pretty quickly.  A pair of all of these fish is wonderful to watch though it doesn't always go well.  Pick one of these types, (I recommend against the hybred flowerhorn), and make a nice aquarium with lots of hiding places.  The best way to breed and observe them is to buy 7 babies and let them eventually pair off.  Be ready to get the one's they force to cower in the far corner out of there or they'll be dead within a day.  Get the green terrors that have the gold stripe on the tail.  They are amazing and good parents if they manage to breed without killing eachother.  The Red Terror (festae) is georgeous as well though also aggressive.|`|AwJXIFDraa	There should be plenty of room.

Su0JYynbaa	http://www.blindhorses.org/    This website is also at top. First site on google, probably the best.  I am so sorry to hear about your horse. I would love to stop him from going blind.  Best of Luck!    Also, I read about this guy with a blind mare. He put lining of cedar bark around the fence inside the mare's pasture, around the trough, etc. Then he lead the horse to the fence, and halted the mare in front of the fence, where the cedar bark had been placed, and in no time, the horse knew that she had to stop at the cedar bark, knowing that the fence was near. She galloped and once she felt the tan bark, the mare just turned directions and continued galloping! I think that's inspiring, I read it in a CHICKEN NOODLE SOUP FOR THE HORSE LOVER'S SOUL - I'm not sure if it was the first or second.   Anyways, I'm sorry about your horse. I hope he doesn;'t go blind in his other eye.    http://www.rollingdogranch.org/horses/ro...   Rocky and Hawk!    http://www.equusite.com/articles/safety/...  http://www.fund4horses.org/info.php?id=3...    Don't worry. There are miniature horses who take care of people when they are blind. You'll be able to guide your horse.|`|SFfE6dOfaa	blind horses have very acute senses because of the loss of vision their other senses become heightened. Blind horses have very strong hearing, which can be good and bad. It is good because that helps them realize where things are, but bad because little sounds sound so big to them that they can scare easily. I've ridden a blind horse before that was blind in one eye for the first 7 years of his life, but then lost vision in his other eye. I rode him when he was 9, he had been completely blind for 2 years. He listened very well to my leg and my rein, but you couldn't just sit back when you rode him, because if you didn't steer at every corner, he would run into the fence. I think that blind horses are aw some! they are really sweet, and they are really strong to get over the loss of one of their senses and to trust ppl so much that they literally follow them blindly. good luck, i hope things work out!|`|4jauPgAyaa	2 of the 3 horses we take care of are well on their way to being blind. Until this week, both were able to be ridden. This week the old guy had a leg injury that ended his riding career. Hes 34 and thinks retirement is pretty good anyway.      As long as they can see something, they may be very easily spooked by sudden movements. We leave food and water buckets in the same place and make sure there is nothing in the aisle that they can run into. Lack of sight hasnt stopped these 2 horses.  They are great boys and while it might take a little more care on our part, they are worth it.|`|Pm8nsCGZaa	I do know of a horse that was blind in one eye, she was a great riding mare and broodmare.

8owlj2xHaa	Seahorses do not require much room, I think the recommendation is just for water stability. This is more difficult in a smaller tank due to the amount of food that is required for them. They need to be fed a few times a day. A 30 gal hex tank is a good sized tank for them, but a 50 would be the best size.   some general seahorse info.   http://www.seahorse.org/library/articles...  a website dedicated to seahorses.

Rwz3dkQSaa	Has his farrier and vet cleared the horse for riding?
Pm8nsCGZaa	Really there is no answer to give you... you have quite the decision to make. All comes down to which horse you like and want the most. I have had to give horses away, luckily I got them all back eventually. I don't know what to tell you.  Weigh the differences between them. Which is more trained and has the better disposition, better bred, etc.? You do have alot to think about.  I wish you the best in your decision.|`|FLBCvJuDaa	Easy enough for me... I'll let you decide.  We'll call it "Survivor Horsetopia."|`|eji2mBAlaa	Woah!  Thats difficult. I have never been in that exact situation so all i can say is what i would do if i was...    okay, so yeah, it would kill me but i would probably keep the horses you have now and let the other horse (Beau, im assuming) be sold on.  This doesn't mean that you have to lose contact.  You seem to have kept in contact with the owners for three years...why dont u see if you can do it again with the next owner.  I kept in contact with my old pony through 4 different owners until she died last year.  (She was a little 12.3hh, grey called Skye).    I think you could probably keep in contact too.  If Beau doesnt move too far away, you could keep in contact with the new owners and perhaps arrange to go and see him every now n then.  If it is too far away, dont worry, e-mails would be great.    It definately is a very hard decision but u have to think about the heartache everyone would go through, including the other pony you would have to sell.  It would be difficult for Beau to understand the circumstances too and you may never have the same bond with him as you had before.  If you let him be sold on, you will be letting him have a nice new home where he can create a really strong, meaningful bond with a new owner who has lots of time to spend with him.  I know it can be hard, but sometimes we have to think about what is best for the horse and not us.    I have had to do a lot of that whilst working on my current TB ex-racehorse who turns 7 in February.    Best of luck with everything and perhaps we could keep in touch via e-mail from profile?  Leigh  x|`|WDfWklRUaa	no one can tell you what to do ,use your head not your heart|`|5C2kWALraa	i know what you are going through...my mom sold this one horse that we had and then the owner called back and said that they couldn't afford to keep her anymore...when i heard this i was so happy...but my mom told me that if we got the horse back that we would have to sell one of the other ones...my advise would be that if you really want this horse back then you would have to choose which one that you would like to keep...if you really want the horse back and you and your mom are really into this horse then you should go for it...if you just want to take a trial thing then you could as the people if you would be able to swap and see if you would like to keep him or not...if say in a week or so that you want the other horse back then just call up the people and tell them that you would like to trade back... but that is just something that i would do but if you do go with my advice then i would make this hole thing into a contract so that if you did go through with it then you would be able to get your horse back...

3sB49YNnaa	Sounds like she will be fine after a bit of time to settle down and recover from the shock of the fall.  The fact that she took right off running normally and ate right away means she didn't suffer any physical harm from the fall.  Unless they land really badly, guinea pigs are usually OK after a reasonable fall.  They are light enough that the force of hitting the floor isn't great enough to cause a problems.  Of course this doesn't mean that you shouldn't be careful that they don't fall.    Bribing her with food is a good way to regain trust so you are on the right track and I bet she will be back to normal soon.|`|f92f4c895d75cb0a24f4ea612297712eaa	she will be fine|`|ourL0HdGaa	keep a close eye on it and if any problems start, call a vet :D|`|rQG60W0Eaa	yes she will be ok.... ? if not call your vet ....|`|SLSX6QQsaa	Aww poor piggy.  Shes probably just scared.  Since she ate, thats a good sign.  Just watch her to make sure shes not limping or anything.  And I would probably leave her alone for a few hours at least to let her calm down.|`|UyRV5pjhaa	Shes fine. Rabbits and guinea pigs can get scared or startled really easy. they are very cautious animals. just give it some time to cool down and it should be alright.|`|euN3ct9oaa	First, if this recently happened like within the past couple of hours, that would be why she's breathing hard and scared. If it has been hours, she might have gotten really hurt during the fall. 3 feet is a long drop for a small animal, especially on a hard surface. If she doesn't act herself in the next few hours, it gives you enough grounds to take her to the vet, although I don't think there will be much they can do for her.       Maybe comfort her, but do not pick her up or take her out of her cage for a while, and gently feel around her body to see if anything feels different or if she shows any signs of pain when you touch her anywhere. This happens to a lot of people, so don't take it out on yourself. Try to be creative and find a way that you can set her home on the ground so if she squirms, it won't be a tremendous fall. Good luck.|`|3e0rDOWTaa	she is probably just in shock. Keep her in a quiet place so she can calm down and just leave her for a while. Go and check on her every so often.   There could be a possibility that she broke a rib or something, so if she doesn't get back to normal soon, I would take her to a vet.|`|NQ3eETlYaa	She will be fine.
KEYgd73saa	You clearly don't want a planted tank with fish; you want a fish tank with plants.  There's absolutely nothing wrong with that, and as you'll find, there are a lot of ways to go about this.  Most stem plants (stems produce multiple leaves; Rotala, Hygrophila, Ludwigia, etc.) grow extremely fast compared to rosettes (each stem produces a single leaf; each stem originates at the crown; Crypts, Swords, Aponogetons).  For this reason, you'll want to avoid stem plants in favor of the more manageable rosettes.  Crypts are among my favorite plants because of their variability and ease of cultivation.  C. wendtii, C. pontederiifolia, C. beckettii, C. balansae, etc. are all fantastic, and very easy to contain to specific areas of the tank.  Amazon Swords are always nice, and will provide bright green leaves that contrast generally darker Crypt leaves.  Even the stock lighting that comes with most tanks will do for these, but if you find the growth to be painfully slow, you may want to switch to an incandescent hood, replacing the incandescent bulbs with compact fluorescents (6,500K) from any home improvement store.    The way you're planning on going, don't bother with fertilizers and the like-- scape the tank as you want with the hardscape (rocks, wood, etc.) first and place the plants around it.  Angels will love a tank with vertical driftwood and tank sides with moderately dense planting.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	The best way to have plants is to make plants the main focus.  There are a lot of plants that don't grow very tall like chain swords so you plant these in your open areas and use taller plants as the backdrop.  You need excellent proper lighting and need to do some reading to decide how you want your set up to look.  Live plant tanks are wonderful though take a lot more work than regular aquariums.  I've had several and unless you have the time to do the water changes and trimming of the plants then don't bother.|`|JC7GxwF8aa	http://www.okanagankoi.com/subcat76.html|`|idzTJOyVaa	yesst go to these links ---------    1.     http://ezinearticles.com/?Plants-For-You...    2.     http://www.okanagankoi.com/subcat76.html|`|yuh7OsHDaa	platies  guppies

She s probably very unhappy in her own life otherwise she wouldn't be criticizing someone who was obviously having a good time. You are not a loser in fact you are a big winner as you have dogs and they are a big part of your life and I'm sure you give them as much love and joy as they give you.

I'm sorry you had a bad time after wards, but I think people that have interests like you of taking pictures and having fun like that, are awesome and have a fun personality, which makes your own style.

Taking pictures of your pets is a good thing to do because it's fun and nice to capture memories of your time with them and show them off to people who like dogs.

Enjoy your dogs and ignore other people. You clearly care for your dogs and have compassion, maturity and sensitivity on your side - that goes a long way in this world. All she has is insecurity and a cynical outlook. Id rather be you than her :-)|`|5tGGFy3Taa	No it doesn't make you a loser    I ALWAYS take pics of my dogs to make sure iv got memories of them when they pass away.    She was probably jealous, she was probably not aloud a dog at your age and wishes she was you.    About 2 days ago on thursday after school i was taking my new puppy on a walk and these boys from school found a dead rabbit on floor and gave it my dog and obviously because my dog is a puppy she thought it was a toy so she tried to get it....    Them boys were jealous they are not aloud a dog.    So keep on taking pitchers of your doggy's and keep smiling :D .    I ALWAYS used to think what other people thought of me but don't just ignore them if your happy with what your doing and just feel good ignore them people if you listen to them they will wreck your life and you will become self conscious.    So don't worry be happy :).    Good luck and remember DON'T listen to other peoples thoughts.    Love  Beth  xx
Oiabe82gaa	Firstly you need to work on the lunge line. This will encourage him to strike off with the correct leg when you ask for canter. If he doesn't, take him back to trot and ask again. Lots of praise every time he gets it correct.  When you are in the saddle, prepare your horse to canter by picking up a balanced, forward trot. Sit for a few strides before asking to canter. Make sure you do a half-halt before you ask to canter, this is to get your horse's attention, informing him you are about to request him to do something. When you are prepared, ask your horse to canter by sliding your outside leg behind the girth and pressing your leg against the horses side. Make sure you put more weight in the INSIDE stirrup. The horse should pick up the correct lead canter. If not simply go back to trot and try again, remain calm. Don't be affraid toreinforce your outside leg with a stick, and keep your hands quiet!!!  Good luck!|`|Bxewx4afaa	The key to getting the correct lead is to push their hip in..   So, if you wont to get the right lead you need to push his hip in to the right do the same   when your going to left. If you can't push their hip in then you need to   practice pushing it in.What you do is put your leg as far behind   the girth as you can and put pressure there  until he moves his hind  quarters  then when he starts doing that easy then do it at the walk. Once   you have his hip  in ask him to canter. He should be on  the correct lead.  if not then you need to practice moving his hip in   more. That's the natural way of picking   up a lead. If it's not natural then it wont work  Your horse needs to be able to move off your leg first that is where I    start and then I do   the hip exercise then I can pick up the canter on any lead at any time I need to.   Hope I helped|`|an1L8njXaa	Ensuring a good trot to begin with will help with getting a good canter.  Make sure your horse is going forward in the trot, then ask for canter when in a corner, aiming to pick up the canter as you come out of the corner  Use your inside leg on the girth, your outside leg should go back and be used behind the girth this signals to the horse which leg you want them to strike off on. Your horse should have correct bend and exagerating the bend can help however you must remember that bend comes through the whole horse not just the neck.  If your horse strikes off wrong, bring him back to trot, establish a good forwards active trot and ask again in the next corner.    To get a lazy horse going forward ask once and only once before backing it up with a smack on the bottom. If i want my horse to go forwards i will nudge him gently to ask him to go, if he doesnt go then i will boot him and give him a smack with a schooling whip.|`|oHL8qA42aa	go on a circle. Get a collected trot or walk going. Walk is easier. From that, bend him to the inside with your inside leg against the girth. Then slide your outside leg back. Now, all i have to do to ask for canter, is put my inside leg on! ;)|`|at7LXbEfaa	Well. u have to look deeper into this.  Was he an ex racer? They are usually galloped on 1 leg so they prefer the left.  we thourght this was the problem with my friends horse. But found out he had torn a ligerment in his right leg once and now is scared he will do it again.  He need a breast plate and traing.  so look deeper.|`|AA10986942	Most people are telling you to ask for a canter when you are on a bend..... well that makes some sense when you understand how to do it correctly but you will create your own bend no matter where you are...  When you want a canter pick up on both reins squeeze lightly with both legs at the same time to collect him, pick up just slightly more on his inside rein, just enough to see his inside eye then take your outside leg leg slide it back and use it to push his hip to the inside (spurs are really useful when asking for the hip to move)  If you have not taught your horse how to move his hip when asked then you need to practice this from a stand still then a walk until he can do it.  When you have him positioned correctly, nose slightly to the inside, hip to the inside, continue to apply your outside spur/leg and make a kiss sound.  If your horse is not trained to this kiss, at the same time urge him into a canter...  (pretty soon after you set him up all you will have to do is kiss and he will take a canter depart)  If you have him set up correctly he pretty much cant get it wrong....  its all in the set up... do you see the bend you created?  nose to the inside and hip to the inside... you can do this on a straight away.....  If he has trouble getting it still try lunging with his head tied slightly bent to the inside to get him used to it.  hope this helps you.  If he gets it correctly let him continue to canter, if he gets it wrong just say no, stop and set up and try again... dont be mean about it or jerk him when you stop just start over and he will be willing to try again and will soon be able to figure out that when he gets it right he gets to canter off when he gets it wrong he has to stop and try again.... he will have a sudden moment when he finally "gets it"  but it may take some time so be patient   PS:  Western people need to get their leads too!|`|JG7W0qvcaa	Use A Whip On The Outside Rein And Praise Him When he Gets It Right    All You Can Do Is Keep Practicing    Hope This Helps     x x x x x x|`|mEKsbCw2aa	Try squeezing with your inside leg and pulling his head to the outside. Or Sometimes it depends on the horse you do the opposite.|`|KFXjRpnFaa	Put your inside leg on the girth and your outside leg just behind it ans squeeze slightly harder with the inside leg. When you ask, sit up straight and tense the butt cheek on the side that you want the lead on (so if your cantering round the arena on the right lead, tense you right butt cheek) and lift that hand as well, keeping the other one in the same position.    A good excersise to practice this on is to trot around the arena then along the long sides turn her into a half-20 metre circle, asking for canter as you leave the track. This teaches him to get the right lead, as its much harder for him to pick up the wrong one.    hope i helped x|`|5kUxkun3aa	I find it easier to get them used to the right lead by pushing for canter coming out of a bend|`|jo0A5RFTaa	i don't ride dressage or anything i'm a show jumper haha    but don't they usually have one leg on the girth and one leg behind and then they switch them around and that's how the horse knows how to do a flying change?      you could try that but i'm not sure what leg to use where to be honest =[ maybe ask the yard manager    do you understand what i'm saying though haha like when you are on the right lead keep one of you legs on the girth and one behind and when you are one the left do the opposite =] =]      >>>the thumb fairy on this question is a little harsh!! everyone has their own ways of training!!|`|bT12aItIaa	alright well i figure its different for every horse but i show jumpers and the only way to make my horse pick up the right lead, even in open fields and stuff is to use just one leg, the outside leg. cause i mean you figure you have to be consistant in everything you ask a horse to do and you are constantly asking it to move away from pressure, asking it to pickup the correct lead you are asking them with the outside leg to set into their correct lead. hope that made sense!|`|UFhrD7DWaa	turn his nose to the inside and sort of shift your weight to the inside and then ask for the canter. ask for the canter in the corners and make sure he is looking to the inside. press your inside leg to him turn his head tot he inside and ask in the corners !|`|NOAwpvcTaa	1st- Pick up your sitting trot  2nd- Come to a corner or circle  3rd- Bring both your reins to your outside hip (bend your horse)  4th- Squeeze your inside leg at the girth, our outside leg a bit behind the girth.    The trick though is not to pull your reins as you ask for the canter. Your horse will get confused (your pulling on me but want me to go faster?)    Hope I helped!|`|FxY3B3mMaa	Stress your inside rein and outside leg to force him on to the correct lead.|`|QOaYyOVAaa	Well you could do what I have to do with my pony.    First see if he only doesn't pick up his lead in certain spots (My pony just hated picking up his lead in one corner and seemed to be able to pick up his lead fine everywhere else)    Second, (And even if he doesn't any spots like that) then you get a good trot going and turn his head towards the outside. Ask with your outside leg for the canter. Naturally he will pick up the correct lead. (I've done that for hunter shows and still place all the same. It's better to have your horse's neck bent when entering the canter then being on the wrong lead. For dressage, I don't know what to tell you.)    Be ready though. If your horse gets into the habit of thinking that when you turn his head to the outside, he'll speed up and might try to get ahead of you. Every now and then you need to switch it up on him. During normal rides around the barn just turn his head out to the rail but keep his speed normal. If he does speed up it should help him think about it a bit before assuming. If he doesn't speed up when ever you turn his head, there's really no need to practice turning his head without the canter.

VDP3pNCPaa	Well, a rat is not simply a larger version of a mouse.  They are a lot larger. Often, those situations on YouTube come about from almost the birth of the kitten.    Also, the kitten has to be trained to hunt by its mother, or it will have poor hunting skills.  So if it is never taught, then a mouse will be simply a play toy. Sometimes, the mouse does not survive being played with, but the few that have gotten into my house have been played to death, not eaten or even had any wound marks on them.
ua1InI3baa	Hi,  I haven't experience the death of a horse due to ragwort poisoning yet, but I do have 4 horses who live in a field where I am constantly battling ragwort. My fingers are constantly crossed, and my eyes constantly scouring the ground for signs.  So much so that I have invented a new device to help deal with the whole situation.  I have a patent pending on it.  I'm not saying this to try to sell it to anyone, but as part of the whole process, I did a huge amount of research into symptoms, growth patterns etc.  I have built a website, which is information only.  There are no products for sale there.  There is a huge amount of information about the whole topic, too much to even scratch the surface here I'm afraid, but hopefully you will find some useful stuff.  Incidentally, according to information from some of the reputable and well known horse sanctuaries in this country, they are confident that most horses and ponies in this country do already have some form of liver damage directly attributed to ragwort poisoning.    This situation can only get worse, as the problem gets worse and Defra, according to their lovely little disclaimer at the bottom of their Ragwort Complaint form page; 'have no legal obligation to act upon complaints received.' It kind of makes you wonder what on earth is the point then?    The website address is http://www.ragtaguk.com    Please feel free to ask question directly, I shall do my best to find the answers.    Salena|`|B6zl0AJDaa	I lost two horses out on lease due to liver and kidney failure because they were eating Oak leaves and acorns and the leasee didn't have an autopsy done when the first horse died 4 years before the 2nd horse did of the same thing.  (I had requested this but it never happened.)     I found out what it was when the 2nd horse was FOUND and brought home (Long story, but the leasee hid him out and he was 500 miles away.).  Our vet did a blood work on him when he came home and told us what would eventually happen (The siezures and such.).  He survived 3 months before he had a major siezure and had to be put down.|`|SzW9GmRsaa	The liver can carry on functioning while a huge proportion of it has failed (I can't remember how much, but I'm sure someone will tell me ... it can function on 20% or something) so once the animal starts showing signs of liver damage it's going to be far too late to do anything about it.    The thing about ragwort is it can take years and years for anything to happen.  She could've been grazing a ragworty field for one summer five years ago, that's all it takes to sit in the system.  Her hay could've been ragworty one winter, she could've picked up bits of ragwort here and there over time, but it does all build up.  It is myth that they will not eat it while it's alive; a horse's desire and instinct to eat outweighs bitter tastes, and if the grazing is that poor they will definitely eat ragwort.  A vet who has done research for (among other things) the Equine Grass Sickness Fund told me that a malnourished horse on a ragworty field will become addicted to the bitter taste, and even when moved to good grass will still show a preference to the ragwort!  Scary...    I'm sorry about the horse, it's a horrible way to go, and not nice for anyone to nurse either.
AA11901352	While it is fine and many tropicals will eat it some will not.  You need to know what your fish need and the diet they need.  Even goldfish will eat raw fish, chicken and beef.  There is nothing wrong with it if they eat it.  Feed away|`|yXDtGo8taa	Depends on what kind of tropical fish. I wouldn't feed them any raw foods, stick with the common flake food diet and if you want add some freeze dried bloodworms or some fresh tubifex worms from a pet store|`|5zU3PqZraa	I make my fish food out of several types of fish, crab, clams and muscles, spinach, nori, carrots, tomato juice, and some other vegetables. I blend this all together until smooth then add lots of gelatin. You can then spread it about a half inch thick on a pan. Then you let it gel. Cut it into little cubes and freeze them. I feed my 30 gallon community fish about a teaspoon of this food a day. You need to thaw it then feed it to them. I liked to feed it to them on the end of a toothpick (it makes me happy, lol). My larger cichlids love this food just as much and have been growing very well on this diet. Now I only feed this food with the occasional treat of frozen blood worms and earthworms. I only have to make a new batch every month or so and they love it. Search "home made fish food" in google for more exact recipes.

IQezKzNEaa	More information would help me give a specific type of answer, but I will assume that you are interested in getting a beagle and you do not already have one.<br>  <br>  Beagles are wonderful dogs--for the right homes.  I personally love beagles, but I live in an apartment, and therefore cannot have one.  Beagles are bred to be hunting dogs, and they are incredibly independent and can be hard to train.  They do tend to love people, and I have never come across an aggressive one, so I think they make good pets if they get the exercise that they need.  Ideally, they would have a farm to run around on and hunt small game for fun, but they can also adapt to a yard.  I don't recommend them if you do not have a yard, because they are the kind of dog that can run around all day without tiring, and no exercise will cause them to become destructive.<br>  <br>  I'll add some sites you can take a look at to help you out!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mTTPLly4aa	Be more specific. Your question is too vague|`|0IMf5SATaa	I agree, your question is pretty vague so hard to know what you want but try looking here to see if you can get the info you need.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beagle</a>|`|Q7Yqtr0Jaa	Beagles are medium sized hounds, which stand between 13 and 16 inches high at the shoulder. They were originally bred for hunting hares in packs and today Beagles are normally sociable, mischievous, healthy and delightful members of an active family. Beagles enjoy company whether it is human, canine or feline and dislike being left on their own. <br>  <br>  A household where the whole family is out from morning to evening is quite unsuitable for a Beagle. They may be on the small side but they can do a prodigious amount of damage in a short space of time to furniture, floors and curtains. <br>  <br>  A Beagle needs a home with a garden, which needs to be fenced with ‘Colditz’ in mind! Beagles can dig as well as jump, so five to six foot high fencing is recommended. They can squeeze through small spaces such as trellis work or wrought iron gates, so you’ll need to make sure you have the right sort of fencing as well as making sure it is high and deep enough. <br>  <br>  Remember that your hound will need to be exercised for at least an hour each day and part of that time should, if possible, be free running in a safe area away from traffic or livestock. Never forget that the Beagle was bred to hunt, it is instinctive and will show up in its behaviour on walks. <br>  <br>  The Kennel Club says, “the man with the lead in his hand and no dog in sight owns a Beagle”, so be warned. Beagles are tough and love being with a family, but children must be taught to respect all dogs and not treat them like toys. Your hound should be provided with a special place of its own such as the folding metal crates, where children are not allowed to go or disturb the dog.<br>  <br>  The Beagle is full of fun, enthusiastic and always ready for any sort of activity. They are easy to feed, too easy sometimes, as he will put on weight easily if allowed. They have an appetite for all sorts of disgusting things and will welcome the opportunity to raid next door’s bins! Beagles are easy to keep clean which is just as well, given their delight in rolling in bad smells. Health surveys have shown the Beagle to be a very healthy breed, having no hereditary conditions that affect them adversely.|`|NWSsIFrDaa	I own one.He is stubborn and loves to sneak into the kitchen to get into the garbage.Snores a lot but really loyal and cute.They need training but are great with kids.Lots of exercise needed and they love to eat.|`|SXfFI05Gaa	They're good family pets.<br>  Stuborn.<br>  Lovable.<br>  Small / Medium (25 - 40 pounds?)<br>  dogbreedinfo.com

GT6396BDaa	He looks like he may grow a bit more.  Dogs are usually full grown and have their full adult coat of hair by the time they reach 1 year-old.  Mostly he will fill out some and develop his muscle tone.  He may reach 100 pounds.  He has broad shoulders, so he will be a big dog.<br>  He's a beautiful dog.

He is very pretty. He might get a little bigger but not much taller. The only thing is his chest area might get thicker but that's about it. He looks like average size.

My cousin has the same kind  of dog and it weighed up to 120 pounds which is the normal weight for that kind of dog. Hope I could help!|`|qapJU3tMaa	I won't open these links.

I admit.  But I do have a friend who has an American Bulldog from the Johnson lines.  He weighs 120 pounds.  So, you may have some of that line in your dog.

PS   He is not full Pit.|`|24CFl7sjaa	He probably wont gain height but he will 'fill out' over the next few years as he matures and his muscles develop more so he could well end up as a 'big' dog.<br>  Lovely looking though, you must be very proud of him.
x5rdxAxbaa	nope. This is the size he will probably stay. I don't think he'd get that big. 60-70 pounds sounds about right. I'd say he's probably a pit mixed with boxer. I've seen a few that look just like him. I wouldn't say he'd get any bigger then what he is now.|`|BI1GbIZUaa	I don't think he'll get that much bigger. Most dogs are done growing at a year. I'd expect him to gain maybe 10 pounds from now. His feet also look like they're too big for his body, he appears to have grown into them already. He is very cute!|`|VXsgFm7taa	Hi - I am Emzy606 step-mum and I work in a vets as a receptionist. I think your vet is right - he will get bigger!

And it's true about the feet. If they look too big for the dog itself- then they usually grow more.

xtRm5NV5aa	I have two of the cages that you can get at the pet stores that come with some good starting things (wheels, food, bedding, sometimes other toys) and honestly those are my favorite. They're cheap, easy to clean, my Syrian loves climbing the wire top of the cage.  I have a CritterTrail Two that my Syrian likes, but it is tremendously difficult to pull apart and put back together when it needs cleaning so, i hate to admit it, it doesn't get cleaned as often as it should when he's using that cage.  And a plastic bin is good, too, cheap, big, easy to clean! Be sure to consider how easily it can be cleaned!|`|taYFAwlzaa	OK. The ones that cost cheeper and last really long. are aquariam tanks or just a plain ol' laundrey basket. I dont think you need to know anythig specific about aquariums tanksss. Just that there kinda heavy and last alot longer than those plastic ones. Ok allso. If you getting a syrian hamster get a laundry basket that pretty high. haha well not super high but high enought that they can jump out(:|`|xyPpruSjaa	Honestly, I swear to God, that the best choice is an aquarium. Pshh, I go to the pet store and see those flimsy pieces of garbage (cage) for like $80 dollars! It's like WTF! Aquariums are chew proof, really inexpensive, easy to clean, provides lots of room, escape proof, and you can decorate it with your own personal taste instead of having those ugly slides and wheels attached already. Get a mesh lid to fit on the aquarium, they're usually found in the reptile section of a pet store.    Aquariums:  10 gallon with a lid = $22  20 gallon with a lid = $45    I have a 20 gallon for my gerbils! And a 10 gallon for my hamster.    To hang a waterbottle in the aquarium, use some WHITE sticky backed velcro.     When I clean it I don't drag it to the bath tub, I only do that once every 2 months for a big clean. If you do it every week, you're an idiot or you want your back broken XD! I take the bedding out, vacuum out the little pieces that are left, scrub with warm water, scrub with a little vinegar, scrub the vinegar off, clean!     If you get a plastic and wire cage you WILL regret it. (experience...*shudders*) ESPECIALLY do NOT get the brand habitrail, crittertrail, anything trail cages! Dangerous and LITERALLY CAGES THAT ENJOY MAKING YOU MAD!    Good luck!

WqSVSZoMaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  My cat Milly is on Felimazole 5mg tablets (four a day) and has been for a few years (bless her). She's on the highest dose tho.. your cat may only need 1 or 2 tablets a day.<br>  <br>  She's 19 years old now so we decided she's a bit too old for surgery (to remove the overactive thyroid gland). <br>  <br>  At first, it was a nightmare trying to get the tablets down her. But she's used to it now and she knows she gets fed straight after so shes happy. <br>  To get her to take the tablets, I pop them in her mouth (one at a time) and syringe a small amount of water into her mouth so she has to swallow. You can also wrap tablets up in a bit of ham or something, but this never worked for my cat (used to spit out the tablet).<br>  <br>  It can get expensive because obviously the tablets are needed for the rest of their life, but they are worth it I think :) Not sure how much surgery would cost.<br>  <br>  Hyperthyroid cats will lose weight, eat LOADS (I swear my cat eats more than I do lol), and their heart rate will be quite fast normally.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped :) x|`|y1Fihj3Maa	My 15 year old male had hyperthyroidism, and he was on meds for several years.  He also developed renal (kidney) disease, and this complicated the meds.  The meds for each of these counteracted each other, and only with careful monitoring by our vet, was he able to remain reasonably healthy.  <br>  <br>  I was not comfortable with radiation treatments nor surgery, so I opted for meds.  Yes it was expensive, but I made a commitment to that cute kitten so many years ago, and wanted his last years of senior life to be as comfortable as possible.  :)  He passed away peacefully in January.  <br>  <br>  At our vet's office they sell "pill pockets", almost as expensive as the meds, but it meant we did not have to force pills down his throat.  The most undignified thing for a cat is to be forced to do anything.  :)
nFcl0BOsaa	You get his food bowl or a treat or whatever, and let him know you have something for him. If the dog wants what you have, he will be excited, wiggling around, wagging his tail, etc. You simply stand there for a moment with the item. Eventually the dog will sit down waiting. It is a natural reflex; "why stand up when you can sit down?" The instant his rear hits the floor, you say "sit" and give the reward. Repeat it every time you have something for him and soon he will be conditioned to sit on command. Never push a dog's butt down to "teach" him to sit. They already know how to sit down. If you're smart, you'll use the dog's natural reflexes to your advantage.|`|aP4bkYOCaa	An easy way to teach him is to get a yummy treat- maybe bits of hotdog or something equally sought-after- and hold it over his nose. Move your hand back over his head and say, "Sit" so that he must bend his neck back and sit in order to still see the treat in your hand. Praise him and give him the treat. Rinse, later, repeat. :)    Best of luck with him!|`|n99NOgHJaa	Maybe just teach him to lay down?|`|GoWPQvgHaa	Take a treat, keep one hand over his butt (so incase he tries to stand) and start with the treat near his nose then guide the treat back and eventually he'll sit.  Tell him sit and only sit to help him remember.    It might take some patience but give him tons of praise when he does a good job.|`|fe447af35c529588ddeb8f78da7b83faaa	Two ways you could try:  1) Try putting a treat over his head so when he sniffs it he has to move back. Usually the dog will sit.  When he does say the word sit and give him a treat.  It may not work the first time, but keep at it.    2) Every time he sits now have a treat ready and when he does it say sit and give him the treat.|`|dRUgXlOLaa	Few things in life are prettier than watching a well-trained dog and one of the basic commands is the sit command. There are several methods of teaching your dog to sit. Two of the most popular are the Click and the Compulsory methods. The Click method is based again on purely positive reinforcement while the Compulsory method uses both positive and negative reinforcements. Let's begin our discussion with the easier of the two, The Click Method.    The Click Method of training a dog to sit is based upon rewarding the animal for the desired behavior. It gets its name from the idea that some audible queue is used to alert the animal of a pending reward with many trainers using a device called a clicker for this purpose. Whenever the audible queue is given, the reward follows immediately. To train a dog to sit by this method requires little effort on the trainers' part. One begins by lavishing the dog with several treats, one right after the other while giving the audible queue.    Then abruptly stop the shower of treats and wait for the animal to direct its attention to you. Now display a treat and give the audible queue as you give the treat to the pet. Now hold another treat at chest level so that the dog must look up to see the treat. After a few minutes, your pet will likely sit down on its haunches because this position makes it much easier to watch the treat. Immediately, when this happens, give the audible queue and reward the pet. Repeat this lesson several times.  After a while you will notice your pet sitting in anticipation of the click and the reward so it is now time to add your verbal command to the routine. When the dog begins to sit, say "sit". This will gradually teach the dog that the command precedes the action and they will learn the meaning of the command in this way. After some practice and a bit of patience, your dog should begin to sit without having to see a reward being offered.    Now let's discuss the more traditional method of training. The Compulsory Method. This is the method grand dad used on his dogs. Tell the puppy to sit while enforcing it. Saying the verbal command "sit" and pushing down on the puppy's tail section to make it contact the floor accomplish the lesson. With some dogs you might have to hold their chin up during this process or they will go ahead and lie down. The object behind the lesson is to teach the pup when you say "sit" that there is no other choice but to sit and so eventually the animal will respond on its own rather than having to be coaxed into position.    Some owners use a tool called a choke collar for this training method. They will leash the dog with the choke collar in place and upon the sit command push the dog down. At the same time they will hold the choke collar down by way of the leash allowing only enough slack for the dog to sit but not stand up. If the dog tries to stand the choke collar tightens around the animals' neck producing extreme discomfort.  The author does not recommend this method as it can produce a nervous and fearful animal, which can become quite aggressive when it feels threatened. Such training also makes leash training much more difficult as it teaches the animal to fear the leash because of the pain inflicted by it. This also tends to lessen the bond between master and dog because the dog comes to associate the master with the pain and discomfort as well and may lash out at the owner or others if the treatment continues.    In whichever method you choose for training your pet, one thing remains constant. Always be consistent. Also be sure to pour lavish affection upon your pet for good behaviors and responses as this improves their bond to you and makes them desire to please you more fully. With a moderate amount of time and patience, your dog will be rivaling any animal presented at the local dog competitions for his well-trained style and mannerisms.|`|EWiw3ECWaa	Try pulling up on his collar that's how trained my dog (he's missing one of his front legs)|`|5lonbh3Maa	teach him like a normal dog take a treat  move it over his head once he starts to sit say sit try combining vocal and hand commands together  so he can see and hear what you want him to do|`|exny4cOwaa	Show the back of your hand to him, with your thumb behind the 4 fingers, whilst holding a small block of cheese or a kind of treat in the other hand, he should sit.

What I would do, would be to wait until he sits on his own, then reward him for it while saying the command...at some point he is bound to make the connection, and be able to sit on command.

The dog should already know and respond to its name. Start the exercise in a quiet room and use a calm voice. Call your dog by its name and show your dog a treat that it loves and have plenty of other treats in your pocket. While the dog is standing show and hold the treat close to the dog's nose and then move it just above its head while moving the treat slowly backwards. The dog should naturally get into the sit position by bending its legs. As its legs are bending say 'sit'. The very second the dog sits, give it the reward and enthusiastically say 'Good dog!' and give the dog a petting. If the dog does the wrong thing don't give any reward and don't fret, just try again. Keep this up over time until the dog has mastered the exercise. Then continue the training varying the levels of distraction. Slowly decrease the food rewards and substitute them with enthusiastic 'Good dog!' praisings and/or pettings.    Additional teaching your dog to sit tips:   - Try this technique before the dog's mealtime so it is hungry and eager to work for the reward.  - In order to avoid confusion, always use the EXACT same command AFTER the dog's name (e.g. Rover, 'sit' not Rover, 'sit down')  - Never fumble around looking for the reward after the dog sits. Have it ready!  - Be patient and never get angry. Dogs pick up on these feelings and won't want to practice with you if it's not fun.  - It's best NOT to push the dog's bum to the floor with your hands if you are having trouble. The dog might well associate this with the actual training and wait for you to push its bum down in the future. If you are having trouble with this technique then an obedience class with other dogs is a great idea|`|zpoNxhGqaa	depends on which leg it is.  if it's one of the front legs, then teach it like a dog with four legs.|`|n7GOiKC0aa	Hi,    Sit command training is one of the simplest commands yet useful.

FJciPjcgaa	Hens don't hide there eggs because of the rooster. They hide their eggs because they are broody (want to be mommies). I don't have a rooster and some of my hens are broody sometimes. The way I fix that is put them in a cage by themselves, they won't nest on eggs because she doesn't have her nest or where she usually lays her eggs.    If you are having trouble with egg hidings, you should put your chickens in a coop at night. It's safer that way anyway. Also you should gather the eggs every night so that the chickens have nothing to hatch. Remember Chicks can't hatch if they don't have a hen to hatch them.|`|rQlzfHqraa	If you don't care about the crowing and don't want chicks put the rooster on the menu.|`|bFzu835Aaa	Why not just sell off the roosters?

Cats have more breath/teeth problems if fed 'wet' cat food. We have four cats and they all eat dry food all the time. They have sweet breath, v clean teeth and their poop is not nearly as smelly. Cats are carnivores but will sometimes eat grass to help them with fur balls as it makes them puke. In the wild they would eat mice/birds all inclusive if you know what I mean, but those bones are soft and tiny. If you want to give them a supplement try brewers yeast tablets as they help repel fleas. Plenty of fresh water is also important.|`|OCgZACJqaa	I don't even give my dog bones, as they can splinter and get stuck in their throats.

But pet stores and vet offices sell chews that are specifically designed for cleaning your cat's teeth.

NAGiNKFWaa	Well this might not help you, but I used to have a dog that would slip a disc in his back, and it would cause his hind legs to be paralyzed.

I don't know if that will help you.|`|PumYhJSvaa	This might be a question best asked in a vet's office. How did he become paralyzed? Did they give him any hope of walking again?    EDIT: I wanted to add that any sign of movement is a good sign. I wish you the best!|`|5A1OS7EUaa	It's nerve ending reaction|`|yrQQ3dJVaa	I would tell someone like your vet them might be able to help more and might even be able to do some kind of surgery to make it so he is not paralyzed.|`|FewhKlx9aa	How old is your dog??How long has he been paralyzed?? If this just happened and he is on medication he could start to walk again..I had a dog that had a pinched nerve in his spine and I gave him massage therapy and he was fin and started to walk again..This was a short time though,if this has been a few years then I would say it is reflexes.He still can show you with his tail that he is happy when you play with him how sweet|`|YLYAo2zmaa	DON'T pop your dogs back you could paralyze him for life.  You did not say if you took your dog to the vet or why he is paralyzed, if he has a diagnosed slipped disc the possibility for full recovery is very good, I have had this happen to two of my dogs and they are both fine now.|`|c68XWGltaa	you have a paralyzed dog?|`|CZLpTU8iaa	Talk to your vet! It's possible. Don't get your hopes up though! Be prepared! Just I would tell your vet what your dog does and ask if there is a chance he could walk again!|`|eji2mBAlaa	that explains exactly why you have a paralyzed dog...you lay on his back!  Cruelty!|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Sounds like a pinched nerve to me. You need an X-ray. It might be fixable if you have the money. You might even be able to find some rich dog lover to help with the medical bill. worth a try.|`|yTgTNTGxaa	not a big 1, but sort of  its just that his spinal cord can have bursts of happiness every now and then, and so he can move a little  but it would be very unlikely if he walks again :(  sorry|`|9G03aQhsaa	Ummm....if he were truly paralyzed, he could not move at all.  Have you discussed this with a vet?  What caused his "paralysis"?|`|knNzAv2Kaa	I am not a vet neither a doctor but work with patient who is paralzyed from the neck down.  Sometimes my patient has a spasm where he moves his leg uncontrollable movement.  I believe this is caused due to the nerve signal sending responses going up to the brain then getting blocked going down and causing confusion.  It may also mean that the dog nerves may not be completely severed like a faulty  wire that sometimes works and sometimes doesnt. '|`|hPgRvmTUaa	It looks bad. Have you brought him to the vet? Its hard to part with an old dog that has been loyal and faithfull for years, but if he has some sort of irreversible illness and paralysis is part of it I think the most humane thing would be to have a vet put him to sleep painlessly. Its a sad decision to make but probably the best.|`|sPDNaDeeaa	well im no veterinarian but i feel that he might not be fully paralyzed or he might be recovering feeling in his legs|`|raJETLfRaa	how was he paralysed? this could determine if he could walk again.|`|XTya50Epaa	It is very normal. ALL dogs are capable of doing this. Don't worry.|`|Sb5QBn90aa	oh that is normal just saying he is glad that you are playing with him just trying to relax too.|`|u9ibIdPjaa	The first question one would ask is, is the paralysis due to injury, tumor, or infection? The answer would greatly affect the prognosis. I would find a veterinary schooll willing to examine the dog. Their resources are usually more vast than those of a veterinarian. Any treatment may possibly be given at a reduced rate.     The movement may be involuntary spastic movements.   In any case, there is always a chance the paralysis is permanent. An option here it to purchase (or build) a 2-wheeled cart which will support the hind legs and offer the dog almost normal mobility.     Thank you for continuing to care for this animal. Many people would not.......|`|O8N2lvMsaa	usally dogs wag thier tail when they want to play|`|2junv2Z9aa	HI- I took a look at some of the other questions you've asked and got a little more history on the dog. :( I'm really sorry about the poor guy- That would be a horrible way to live- I'm sooo sorry.  I would guess that the movement is a good sign! :)   I had a couple questions for you- Is he seeing a vet regularly? What was his diagnosis upon arrival the first time (after falling out the window)  Do you ever try to coax him into getting around? Or can he get around at all- Because you said he stretches his legs out sometimes I'm assuming he isn't completely paralyzed. And yes this is a good sign- Maybe with some healing and TLC he may be able to walk again or at least get around.   How old is the dog? Sorry for all the questions! Good luck! i feel soo bad for the little guy!
AXTUWKwcaa	Wow this one has me stumped as well! Just keep poking around in the plants and stuff. Maybye even look in the filter?

3n60UxgQaa	Fish that are floating upside down aren't playing a game.  They're in trouble.    Swim bladder is the first thing that comes in my mind.    Feed your fish a deshelled pea.  Use the frozen/fresh ones as the canned have preservatives that may be harmful.    After that single pea, don't feed him for 2 days.|`|0b8c6deec73968ee5de1b69c2345788caa	only if its a game and not a dead fishy or you will just be waisting treats lol|`|fDjbyBiNaa	hahaha =D
kVmz5nBhaa	Spayed means a female animal is fixed, meaning it cannot be a mother.    Neutered is the same thing for a male.|`|oqcjAMJQaa	Spayed is for female animals. It means they have thier ovaries removed and can no longer get pregnant.     Neutered is generally for male animals. It means that they have their testicles removed.     It is highly suggested that pet owners have their animals spayed or neutered for a couple of reasons. First of all, once the animals have been 'fixed', their tempermants are generally going to be better as a result of their lack of hormones. Also, by 'fixing' them, they have a lower risk of contracting some diseases or illnesses.     Oh, by the way, the laymans term for spaying or neutering is being 'fixed.'  Hope this helped!|`|ptgng2RFaa	it means no more babys|`|F3LBgfvwaa	It means they get sterilized so they are incapable of reproduction.|`|UBxKqdPwaa	When an animal is spayed the doctor removes the female reproductive organs.

His testicles are removed.|`|e5811253bdeb94bf218102979982f849aa	spayed is for female animals and it means to as in human terms "tie their tubes"    neutered is for male animals and it stops them from ejaculating|`|X2TnitFwaa	It means they had part of their anatomy altered so that they can't reproduce. It also makes them more docile, usually.|`|uktBnDP3aa	neauterd is when the dogs or cats testys get surgically removed   spayed is when female cats get there ableness to make babys removed some how    personally i dont get my male dogs neatered because i wouldnt want to be|`|EijzrUn1aa	That means removing their reproductive organs so they cannot reproduce. Some people do not neuter their male animals because they think they are taking away the manhood. That is not true. Neutering lessens the chances of testicular cancer, your dog getting out and getting hit by a car, roaming,  and can calm them down a lot. There are only a few reasons why you should not get your dogs fixed:  1. They are show dogs. Show dogs are not to be fixed.   2. You are a PROFESSIONAL breeder.  3. There are health problems keeping you from doing it.  Just because you wouldn't want to be neutered is not a reason to have unaltered dogs.|`|isELQCJRaa	spayed is when you have a female cat or dog sterilized and neutered is for the males.
FJciPjcgaa	All animals drink milk except birds and fish. When cats are babies they nurse from their mothers. THAT'S CAT MILK. Cow milk is not good for cats. Even when they are babies cow milk is bad. Kitten that are fed cow milk will eventually die. I don't know why. Adults will drink the cow milk but will get diarrhea. So even though they will drink it, it's not good for there stomoch.|`|8tJPK69iaa	because they like it, although cows milk can cause gastric problems so I wouldn't do it often.|`|m0a7Ox1maa	they don't - it's a myth    they don't digest cow's milk well due to the lactose in it    they only drink milk when they are babies and being fed by the mother cat|`|apUkTo3maa	CATS ARENT SUPPOSE TO DRINK MILK IT GIVES THEM WORMS WHEN THEY ARE BABIES?|`|507f5d1dd6627ed845d17676cbe8e0f5aa	dont know why they do but they do like it. however it is not good for them. you should only offer them water...|`|VDP3pNCPaa	Once they are weaned, most, but not all, cats become lactose intolerant.  That means they suffer the same problems people who cannot drink milk do.    Yes, perhaps Disney in his cartoons got everyone thinking cats all love milk, seeing Figaro drink his milk.
s8QbZ0RLaa	He's probably dying. Instead of letting him starve to death, you can euthanize him (humanely kill him.)  The easiest and most humane way I've heard of and I use as well is to take a small bowl and put some water in it. Let it sit in the freezer until there's a thin layer of ice. Take it out and crack the ice layer. Net the fish into the water and he will die after about 2 seconds. He won't feel any pain and will end his misery.|`|3n60UxgQaa	It's probably in shock.  Usually when they get sucked in the filter, they don't live for long after that.    The fact that it got sucked in the filter again shows that it was way to weak to even go against the current.    Unfortuntatly, I don't think your fish will make it. =[|`|3tClNAISaa	your fish is not paralyzed it is just dead so throw it away and get a new one.|`|mrQKfR1faa	it'll die tomorow.. Whatever it has, Its fatal and you cant recover it now because its too late. I'll bet it has swim bladder or an internal infection.  Oh and its up against the filter because its weak and I'm not sure why, but whenever one of my fish does that, it always goes up to the filter on purpose, not just because it sucks it on to it, but for some other strange unknown reason|`|nJthdb74aa	sounds to me like your fish got injured from the filter and is possibly paralyzed. It will probably die so dont feel bad if it does. it happens. If your fish are getting sucked up by the filter try getting tank splitters. you can find them at pet stores like a pet smart. If i was you i would put the tank splitter just in front of the filter. that way your tetra will be safe from getting sucked up by the filter. It has too strong of a current.|`|qAwnAYGAaa	its definitely dead or on the way out|`|J1F3SRJsaa	Well start by turning off your filter, then remove the tetra and place it back in the tank, you may want to try to put a screen around the suction tube to keep it from happening again.   If it seems ill you can try placing it in some water with table salt, like a teaspoon of salt this usually works pretty well. Unless you know that it's suffering, Dont kill it, since you are not God .|`|Z2iRif5Kaa	Don't feed him. It sounds like he has a swim bladder infection. Place water from the tank in a seperate bowl, put him in there for about 2 days, then feed him a pea. Let him stay in there for another 2 days, and he should be fine.
qEp9fxU9aa	These are both too large for a 46 gallon.  The Rainbow Shark is a loach and will get over 1'.  The black ghost knife will get a little larger than this.  The black ghost knife doesn't seem to mind more cramped quarters though a 46 is just too small.  I wouldn't put them in anything smaller than a footprint of 4' x 1 1/2', which is typically a 75 gallon though a standard 90 has this same footprint only taller.  The Loach is far too active to be in anything less than a 6' tank.  They don't need a lot of height though should also have 18" front to back.  A fish should be able to turn around without touching both sides of the aquarium.    BTW:  Nice tank, I love these heavily planted they project a great depth perception for their size.  Give some thought to other ideas.  I don't know about the Green Tiger Barbs though the regular tiger barbs are fin nippers and will tear up your ghost knife until he gets large enough to eat them.|`|Ik6WOcw3aa	The black ghost knife can grow to 20 inches, so thats a big no. Even though they normally max out around 16 inches, thats still way too large for that tank. Besides, the rainbow shark would probably harass the knife to death.
FewhKlx9aa	I can relate with you as I have 10 little ones and trying to get 3 at a time was impossible..What I do now is get the ones I'm not taking and put them outside so I can get leashes on the others..Then I get the 3 I'm taking and hook them up outside and get the others in the house.I give them a treat and then I leave to go for a walk or to the store..This took practice but I finally managed as it was;nt easy at first..See if it works for you
CVXCSTHoaa	I actually just got over this problem with my dog. He would pee whenever i left the room.   My dog trainer said it was to do with him marking his territory and getting scared when i leave the room. He told me to take him out more often and start house training him again.    My advice to you is to catch him in mid pee of if you see him getting ready to go and take him outside done mess with the leash. If he does go to the bathroom in the house show him what he did and take him out or if you have a crate put him in there for about 30mins and then when you get him out take him out side.  If he is peeing at night put his water up 2hrs before you go to bed. then first thing in the morning let him out.  It could also be excitement, i don't know if you have kids or someone that plays with him it could be him getting very excited about play and he has to go and he is more focused on playing instead of going out.    if he keep spiting up it could be the food, if it continues call the vet and ask them what you should do. i hope this help.|`|HuOQ2B3oaa	Take him to a Korean restaurant.  It's time.

I wouldn't try and scare him though.|`|JYPrhKrgaa	i would try him with some wider jumps just to see how he goes, he sounds great.    try and get some chunky logs or odd looking sticks and some flapping thing on the side of the jump or under it, like a flag or a cloth of some sort, just in case, u never know what they have on the course, but i think nothing will phase him.    good luck, Bye

jW3apvpVaa	there are a few ways to do this.      1. buy a BAG a cat treats. make sure the cat likes them. once or twice a day shake the bag, call the cats name, and give her/him a treat all the same time. eventually it's name will be associated with the treat and i may start to come to you.    2. if you give your cat food from a can call the cats name and then feed it. (if you try giving your cat can food you will know what im talking about) :)    3.buy a laser light. call the cats name and let it play with the light. sense 99% of cats LOVE this toy it would be a great thing for your cat to associate it;s name with and it will learn quicker.    there are others ways to do this. be creative. all you have to know is that cats learn by association and "trial and error".  as long as the cat associated it's name by something it really likes, it will learn to come running when called.    good luck!!  :)|`|L4z1FI5Kaa	My cats not only know their names by using the method suggested, but I've also taught them that when I whistle (the way people whistle to a dog) it means food time.  I do this because whistling travels further than calling.  Should one of my indoor cats ever get out and get lost, it will be more likely to hear me whistle than calling.  So, every time I open some cat food, I start to whistle and only stop when they have their noses in the trough!  It's called a Pavlovian reflex|`|n4zSSH9jaa	cats generally answer to names ending in a y or an i, one of mine l had to change her name to suki and now she answers to it, so my 3 are called suki, ruby and billy and they all answer to these, ruby even answers to rubes and rube, so just have an easy name for them to learn.|`|4oRe4kGjaa	food is the best way call it by name every time you feed it. make it come to you than set the food down.|`|Ntegr2Tlaa	Its so simple, just say the name every time you feed,let out,stroke...the cat soon learns the voice tones to the name...|`|AA11443269	Through out my life I have never been able to get a cat to respond at all.

And em...its necessary when they really have eggs in there.|`|taYFAwlzaa	One word(:  no(:.|`|bFzu835Aaa	Yes!   All birds need something in their nests. It helps form a nice spot for the eggs to settle which in turn helps the parents properly incubate the eggs (it's a lot harder if they're all just rolling around on a hard floor).     It's also very important for when the chicks hatch. Chicks kept on a hard flat surface usually develop splayed legs. This is when the legs stick out sideways from under the bird. If uncorrected, the chick is basically crippled and unable to walk/perch, etc. They need something under them for support to keep their legs underneath them properly while they're developing.    I personally use plain Carefresh bedding as a base an inch or so thick, then give the parents paper, specific shredable toys, etc for them to arrange as they see fit in the nest boxes.|`|uIk9MAnDaa	yes or you can put some cotton or toilet paper in the breeding box or on the ground so that they can make it them selves it is better to put in the the breeding box so the mommy does not have to work with the heavy lode of eggs.                                     :)|`|UictPrl5aa	yes they do,   the last answer is right on|`|1tOr2qLAaa	When I had baby budgies I used shredded newspaper.

But if it is just right, then okay. But they need to have perches and make sure that there are no wires poking out anywhere. They also need their food and toys...you have to find a way to put the food and water cup without them making it fall. Good Luck.|`|UictPrl5aa	It would have to be a very big guinea pig cage, bigger than I have seen before, also it would have to be cleaned, very very well.

The spacing and bars will cause them to get their heads stuck and they could break their necks. It would also be very difficult to care for, not to mention it is way to small. Get a nice 20x20 bird cage if you're going to have 2 of them. and make sure you read up on what kind of branches you can put in there, many are poisonous.|`|guAiKLpGaa	I wouldnt think its safe because they can really easy die because of the type of habbitat when i first got mine i was gonna try the same thing but i didnt want to risk it so i bought a really good cheap cage at Wal-Mart

D1beU6MPaa	To get rid of fleas there are some things you need to do. first, get a good flea shampoo, and read the directions. Most will not do any good if you don't leave the lather on for the recommended time. Then, treat him with a good product such as Frontline, or Revolution, a very good product. You need to get flea bombs for every room in your house, two for large rooms. Before setting them off, make sure all pets, and family members are away for a few hours, even fish tanks. Next, you need a good insecticide to treat your yard. You need to treat your yard as well in order to get rid of your flea infestation. Good Luck to you      If you do all these things, you will keep the fleas at bay. But the trick is, it all has to be done at the same time. If you bathe your dogs, and wait a week to treat your house, you have lost the battle. Also, when you do bath them, make sure you keep the lather on them for the recommended time.

If she does have fleas, use good pet shampoo & let on for 10min.  make sure it does not contain a soap or detergent base -this will remove the flea spot-on treatment.   Usually you must wait at least 48hr after applying to give another bath.|`|6GUARqpCaa	If you want to really get rid of the flea, you also need to clean all area where your dog hangs out or sleeps in. You may need to treat the areas with flea spray, and wash all the pillows and bedings, rugs etc. Fleas live in a live cycle, you kill the adult fleas now, but the baby ones will hetch soon, so you need to keep using the flea drop for a while (read the instruction on the products).|`|5M5BFB5Caa	Not all the stages of the flea are killed with the flea drops.  The stage that no flea product on the market can kill is the pupal stage.  For this reason, you can do everything in the world to get the fleas off of your dog, but in a short period of time you will notice them on her again.  The pupae reside in the carpet, your furniture, and even your bed if you let your dog up there.  Stimuli like carbon dioxide, heat, and vibrations can cause some to "hatch" but they can remain in that state for up to 6 months if there is no host to feed on.  The only way to eradicate a flea problem is to treat everything.  The dog should get a flea preventative every month for at least three months and you should vacuum your carpet 3 times a day if possible.  There's a product called "over and out" that is a fire ant killer but also works on the fleas not in the pupal stage.  It would be a good idea to sprinkle this around your yard especially in any cool, shady places that your dog likes to sleep, like under trees, bushes, or under the house if it's on lifts.  Like I said, treating fleas is a real project, just doing a couple of baths isn't going to eliminate the fleas.     Also, every flea drop (except Frontline Plus) will wash off in the water.  So if you give your dog a bath again and it did not get Frontline, you're going to be right back where you started.|`|2be14aaeddfaa187fb19a7f9392bf657aa	If you are using Frontline then you need to wait 48 hours before a giving a bath and 49 hours after a bath to apply.    If you bought an OTC flea product do NOT use it either return it or throw it away. OTC flea products are very dangerous..they can cause skin irritation, skin burns, neurological issues, seizures, kidney failure & even death.    If you got a good quality, safe product from your vet you do not need to give another bath.    Frontline Plus kills eggs, larve and adult fleas on your pet.|`|exny4cOwaa	Read the flea drop packet, and take her to the vets for proper check up.|`|upSUC0oeaa	flea bath is harsh on a dogs skin you shouldn't bath her in it to much try putting some lavender oil  in a the bath water and ot will kill the left over fleas a good antie flea agent is advantix or revolution they are monthly treatments that you put their back it is the best way the treatment is only $15 or around that price   http://www.revolutionpet.com.au/PetOwner...  http://k9advantix.petparents.com/  both of the advantix and revolution also cover important other things like revelution stops hart worm etc....

qEp9fxU9aa	There is a goldfish in China they claim is over 100 years old.  The one I had from the school fun fair lasted 13 years and I'm the one that did some changes to the aquarium and sadly killed him.  Keep up on good maintenance, proper sized aquarium and no heater and your goldfish can live a very very long time.  They are carp.|`|bDPVRtCNaa	Goldfish should live at least15-20 years, but living longer is not unheard of.    The only excuse for a goldfish not making it that far is inproper care. Keeping goldfish in bowls or small tanks has given people the impression that goldfish have short lifespans, when the sad truth is that people don't give them the chance to live.     When a person tells me that they have had tons of goldfish in an attempt to show their knowlegde of fish, I am not at all impressed unless those tons of goldfish are still alive.    I work in a pet store and listen to people tell their children that goldfish don't make good pets because they don't live long. I always make a point of jumping in at that point and explain to them that a well cared for goldfish would still be with them when their kid goes off to college.|`|sZGzUmLDaa	the average lifespan is 15 years according to this website|`|Z7RiriL6aa	Anywhere from a day to 7 years. Mine lived 7 years, it was crazy, so they do have the potential. But most live around 1-2 years.|`|GoWPQvgHaa	It depends on what kind of fish it is.

While using a 10lt tank instead of a small bowl will increase longevity, albeit not by much, 40 liters per fish or more is necessary for quality of life.Choose a tank with a large surface area to increase the amount of oxygen in contact with the surface of the water (i.e., wider is better than taller).   Set up the tank prior to the purchase of fish. Getting it ready may take two or more weeks. It is necessary to build up enough good bacteria to break down the fish's wastes. To do this, do a "Fishless Cycle". Once completed, your Goldfish aquarium will have more than enough bacteria to break down the wastes your fish will produce. Failure to cycle a tank will result in ammonia poisoning.   Provide mental and physical stimulation for the fish. Decorate the tank with gravel, bridges, plants, etc. Gravel provides a place for good bacteria to grow, and goldfish like to hide and swim through little buildings and bridges. Rearrange the bridges and plants on a monthly basis to offer the goldfish "new" areas to explore.   Add a filter. Either a large internal or an external is best, as goldfish are very messy creatures. Without a filter, smaller tanks will foul and become deadly in just a day or two. Keep in mind that having a filter doesn't mean you can avoid cleaning the tank. Even with a filter, change 20% to 30% of the water about once every week.   Add some equipment to increase oxygen diffusion into the water. A small air pump and air stone will be sufficient.   Clean the tank at least once every two weeks, but more frequently is preferable due to the large amount of waste goldfish produce. This is essential. How often you do this will depend on the size of your tank, the number of fish, and the effectiveness of the filter.      When you add/change water, use a dechlorinator that also removes chloramine and heavy metals as per instructions.   Frequently test for ammonia and nitrite. A pH test is also handy to ensure your goldfish's water is not too alkaline or acidic. This can be purchased at any pet store. Do not modify the fish's water, however, unless it is significantly different from neutral. Goldfish can tolerate a wide pH range, and pH modifying chemicals are not a lasting solution without more consistent monitoring than most people will do. A range of pH 6.5-8.25 is fine. Many municipal water supplies buffer their water up to around 7.5, and goldfish will live very happily in this range.   Do not remove the goldfish during a water change. Using a gravel vacuum to suck debris out of the gravel can be done with the fish in the tank. Frequent partial water changes are better than full (and stressful) water changes.   If you do need to catch your fish, consider using a plastic container rather than a net, as the fish can injure its fins and scales while thrashing around. This also increases stress! If a net is the only option, soak it prior to use. Dry nets are much more likely to cause injury than wet ones.   Allow the water temperature to change as the seasons change. While goldfish don't like temperatures over 75F (24C), they do seem to like seasonal variations where the temperature falls to the high 50s or 60s (15-20c) in the winter. Fancier goldfish are an exception and cannot easily tolerate temperatures below about 60F (16c). Be aware that goldfish will not eat below 50-55F (10-14c).   Feed the goldfish once or twice daily with food specifically designed for goldfish. If you choose to feed them twice, then reduce the size of the meals. Give them only as much as they can eat in a few minutes, and clean any leftovers immediately. If a floating food is used, soak it in water for a few seconds before feeding so that it will sink. This reduces the amount of air the fish swallows while eating, which in turn reduces the risk of flotation problems.|`|xbyQAU4haa	The fact is 15,  but in reality, the average goldfish lives about 1-3 years.|`|3bf821ff353c216ffc93ff7a91b60828aa	When kept in the right way, meaning-kept in the properly sized tank with the right filtration, fed a varied diet, and you perform 25% partial water changes each week, your goldfish has the best shot at living past 20 years.    Anyone that says goldfish only live a few weeks to a few months, or anything less then a few years....didn't care for their's properly.  And, goldfish laying on their sides is NOT normal.  That's a sign of ammonia poisoning or gill flukes, not over eating......My remaining goldfish that survived the snake attack in their pond are pushing the 10 year mark now.|`|t85b6QMiaa	Given a good and ideal condition, a healthy goldfish can easily live for 15 to 20 years.     In order to increase the lifespan, you should provided ample oxygen supply that's why most of the expert insist on keeping goldfish in a large tanks rather than in a goldfish bowls.     An oxygen-rich, well aerated, free of waste, sturdy cold-water plants varieties, a good current and a plenty of open space for swimming is the ideal environment for your sweetheart. They like to dig the bottom for food so avoid having sharp gravel as substrate.    Goldfish do better in cold water compare to warm water. Regular practice of changing of the water - a quarter of the water a week will help in keeping them in good health.|`|4zelCEY6aa	They can live for more than 20 years.

XUo3vYmnaa	Your APBT may not be skinny at all. One thing you may want to do is switch to a Food with a little more fat. 12% Crude is light as APBT's have incredible drive and can surely use the fat. Think about a food with more fat. I use EXCEED CHICKEN & RICE a Sams club product but just read the package and find something you can buy locally. EXCEED is a great food and is very reasonable about 28.00 per 44lb bag.    Second, make sure like mentioned below that the dog has not only be dewormed but is free of worms. Too many people use general dewormers but dogs still suffer from worms. That will kill their passion to eat.    Run him as much as you can as this will not only help the APBT in regards to muscle building but also create a larger desire for food.  Fetch, running with him or just chasing him around are all great ways to give him some more exercise.|`|oNXygeVZaa	Take him running, that worked on my Boxer. :)|`|18uFvmFDaa	Take him to a dog park!

What kind of food are you giving him?  Pitbull's require certain foods that helps them gain weight.  I believe my sister-in-law uses BillJac's and that helps add the weight onto Chance. To turn it into muscle she and her fiance take him on 3 or 4 walks a day and play with him.  If you have one of those ropes where the dog holds onto one end and you pull the other, it really builds their jaw muscles.  Chance is very big [not fat but stronge] and intimidating [to me, at least].|`|PdotFx4naa	De-worm him.  Then get a vet check to make sure everything is in working order.  After all that, just make sure he's eating well.  Exercising him will only build the muscle, not make him fatter.  I have a 9 1/2 month old and she is only 45 pounds, very tiny.

VDP3pNCPaa	That becomes a value judgment and a peace of mind issue.    Monitor her and if she seems much more lethargic, then you can still take her to an emergency vet.  Probably doesn't matter all that much whether a Saturday or Sunday for that.  Otherwise, first thing Monday morning.|`|5M5BFB5Caa	She may have worms causing her to be anemic.  Pale mucous membranes are definitely a sign of anemia but could also be a sign of something more serious.  Anemia doesn't usually affect the eyes so I would take her to the vet an hour away.|`|AA10139925	I would take her to the vet. as soon as possible. The problem with cats is that it doesn't take much for them to go into shock if they don't eat. If a cat doesn't eat in 24 hours, they get extremely dehydrated which is very dangerous for a cat.  The problem is you don't know what is wrong with her and 24 more hours could result in a worsening of symptoms and that isn't good.   Bite the bullet and pay the extra money to take her for your peace of mind. Good luck and I hope she is ok.
ErNNjUdjaa	It is better to get an animal that is more tolerable to little children and rats are the better choice against mice.    I don't have children or actually rats either, but my friends all own rats and I say that they are pretty great. Rats are smarter than mice and more interactive. Rats believe it or not are very clean animals; they groom themselves and don't go to the bathroom on you. All they do is scent track, which might look like it's pee but it's not.    However it depends on the child on how they would react.  Even though my only concern would be if the child played to rough with the rat and the rat might bite the child. (As everything else in the world does)  Also rats have pretty sharp nails so that could also be unpleasant for a child's soft skin. But those are the only concerns that I have.

nFcl0BOsaa	Puppies should still be with their mother and littermates until at least 8 weeks of age -- a few weeks longer for toy breeds. In many locations it is even illegal to sell a dog younger than 8 weeks. By the way, many breeders of small breeds simply raise the pups in a large whelping box because it's easier to contain the mess. But this practice does not allow the pups to experience walking on different surfaces.    You may want to check to see if the fur on her feet, between her toes, is growing so long that it's making her slip. If it is, have a groomer show you how to trim it.    And yes, very young dogs sleep a lot, just as a baby human does.|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No puppy or dog likes to walk on hardwood floors or linoleum, you should put some rugs down so the poor thing can walk.

Google it.<br>  -Shay|`|g5TyTEGsaa	Its called ich, Ich feeds on the skin and gills, providing sites for infection by other organisms, such as bacteria and fungus. In addition, the resulting holes in the outer layers of the fish make it difficult to maintain the proper concentration of salts in the body. Ich is caused mostly by stress, a few of these stresses include poor water quality (elevated ammonia or nitrite, sudden temperature changes, or low dissolved oxygen), poor nutrition, crowding, improper social structure, and aggression. Another reason would be if you introduced a new fish to the tank that already had ich and spread it. A good medication is Maracide from Mardel Labs, you can get it at most petstores. Good luck!

I think she's just getting older.|`|Hwybmzg5aa	maybe it is just old age the same thing happened to one of my dogs.|`|fMRcX2WDaa	wow that is kinda scary not sure what to tell ya but maybe get a second opinion for a different vet see what they say. good luck hope its nothing bad|`|OxFsslN8aa	I have a 1.5 year old female dachshund and I look forward to the day when she slows down!  I say count your blessings.
fWf3A3Ioaa	The safety issue is there regardless of if you get your eggs fresh daily from your own hens or you buy them at the grocery store.<br>  As long as you are cooking the eggs and meat thoroughly and you are disinfecting counter tops, cutting boards, etc., that may come into contact with the raw meat or eggs, you should be fine.
dl1OOOT8aa	Hey CC. <br>  This actually happened to me before as well. I found a "stray" Pomeranian at a park and instantly knew from the diamond collar that it wasn't an ordinary stray dog. <br>  <br>  Anyways long story short, two people "claimed" the dog was theirs. One said the dog's name was lola and the other said it was cola, i kid you not. First person said the dog ran out of the apartment and other said the dog was in the backyard the last time they saw her..... So I found out that the first person stole the dog from the 2nd person and then lost the dog again, now that takes a special kind of stupid. <br>  <br>  Moral of the story: There will be TONS of people who will "claim" the dog, hide a detail about the dog. I.E. dog collar, the gender, coat color, if it's been altered, etc.|`|fPLv0QrSaa	You could take her to an animal rescue. She would likely get adopted right away. A good animal rescue will give her any medical attention she might require. They will also typically vet the person adopting her to minimize the change of her getting abandoned again. If you are concerned about the shelter putting her down, talk to them about it. I talked to someone from my local shelter and they said they rarely have to put an adoptable dog down. Usually it only happens to sick or aggressive dogs.|`|0IMf5SATaa	just remember that she could have been stolen by these people and dumped if they decided for whatever reason they didn't want her. <br>  I would at least post adverts around and search the lost dogs sites, somebody somewhere could be crying their eyes out over their missing baby.|`|94ef238f7854b4c3d9896acaeb2179a1aa	I can't believe anyone would just dump that little cutie! I would call the aspca and tell them that you have it just in case someone is looking for it.|`|1gXo8oHtaa	I would keep her she is cute and young give her a great life she looks like a really nice puppy you would be foolish to get rid of her.<br>  -shay|`|AA10500537	it would be so nice if you gave it a home ,<br>   i hope you do you sound like a caring family|`|RT8LZy7gaa	When a very nice cat showed up at my door, I placed an ad in the paper and called local vets. A few people called but no one claimed him. So I got him neutered, and now I'm adopting him out. (I'd love to keep him but my male cat just doesn't want to play nice). If they become buddies before someone I think is a good home comes along, than I'll be his owner. I can understand your dilema!<br>  <br>  Reporting him to the shelters, vets and police was a good idea and I'm glad you did it. Sounds like either someone snatched the dog out of spite or they were someone that knew you had dogs and thought you'd take her in.<br>  <br>  If someone bought her on impulse from a pet store and just got tired of her, sadly she probably met the fate of alot of dogs. Fortunate for her, you're a nice person!<br>  <br>  Chances are she may be microchipped if she came from a breeder. You can call vets or shelters until you find one that has a reader to see if she is. Then they can reunite her with her family. (I had my vet check the stray cat and he wasnt microchipped).<br>  <br>  Make the person claiming to be her owner provide proof of purchase (cancelled check, papers, etc.) or a recent picture. With a pup that cute, you know the owner would be snapping pics right and left!)  Good luck and if no one claims her, and you keep her, you can know she was left with you for a divine reason.|`|omKbnOCVaa	Its a nice looking dog, PLEASE look for an owner before considering keeping it. It could have been stolen. I know its cute and you would love to prance around with a poodle but do NOT be selfish it could be some little girls best friend. LOOK FOR A HOME FIRST! Go to your vets and have him checked for a microchip. Post signs around the neighborhood "found poodle".<br>   Look and LOOK for the owners OK!<br>  <br>  DO NOT BE SELFISH!<br>  <br>  ADD: Thats nice but i am thinking about the puppy and the owner it probably has. Like i said DO NOT be selfish about it REALLY REALLY with everything look for an owner.<br>  <br>   Oh yeah i have 4 purebred poodles and a CH poodle! So i know how some people can be with poodles ok. I mean purebred poodles.|`|5zaHlQtzaa	SO CUTE!!!  I would probably keep her but i am a sucker like that. If you dont want to keep her i would look for a dog rescue in your area, that way you can insure that she goes to a good home. I cant believe someone would just drop her off like that though! A great looking poodle!<br>  <br>  I do agree that i dont think anyone would just drop her off...she is probably stolen or something. I would check craigslist and see if anyone is missing her.|`|M2h3JF7Zaa	she is so cute! you did the right thig by calling the police and aspca. sounds like maybe someone just didn't want her, people do it all the time, it's so sad. it be nice if you could give her a good home.|`|kWwgWSSgaa	What I would do.<br>  <br>  First take the pup to my local vet to be scanned for a microchip.<br>  Check for a tattoo<br>  Place an advert in the dog section of my local newspapers<br>  Contact the local breed club to see if someone has reported a litter/puppy stolen.<br>  Email/post an A5 mini poster to local vets/rescues.<br>  <br>  I would make every effort to reunite the puppy with it's family/breeder as it could be lost/stolen with a family searching for and missing it. If you cannot trace the owner by any reasonable means, then if you are in a position to, offer the pup a home.<br>  <br>  Edit: If the pup has any identifying marks, withhold the information, as you may need to screen people who *claim* the pup belong to them.|`|D1beU6MPaa	Well obviously if your Mom saw somone drop it off, they don't want it. The picture of it is just beautiful. If you want to keep the dog, I don't see why you shouldn't. I am sure that you will give it a lot better home than the previous owner who obviously didn't  want her. Kudos to you!|`|c5d771b4a5fe3772df346e3ce4f775d2aa	I would put up some flyers, maybe put an add in the newspapers lost & found.  But I would definately make someone prove ownership if they claimed her.  But heck yeah, keep her if you can't find her owner.  Who knows, it could have been a evil boyfriend/husband who didn't like his girls dog and decided to dump it.|`|82cb8f9319b4af25b84a0e62e4814ffbaa	OMG!!! How adorable. She looks like a little stuffed poodle...lol<br>  <br>  If somebody stole her then why would they just drop her off like that? It doesn't make sense. <br>  <br>  Well I'm sure if you do not find the owners then she will have a wonderful life with you. Good luck!|`|tnTxHVO5aa	She is adorable!  She is well groomed to be someone's cast away.  Try to find an owner.  I'm betting somebody stole her and decided to toss her when she either got carsick or wouldn't stop whining.|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	There is definitely something fishy about this. <br>  - not that your lying I mean the people that dropped it off probably stole it - <br>  <br>  I would take her to a vet to see if shes chipped. You can check <a href="http://www.petfinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.petfinder.com</a> for a "lost dog"<br>  <br>  Put up signs. Just put <br>  <br>  ( found poodle ) <br>  <br>  with a phone number. When someone calls. Ask them to tell you what collar she was wearing what the sex is what the color is. This will keep you from giving it to someone who isn't really the owner.

4yt4D3vMaa	If it's wild then leave it, it's sick and the stress of human contact could kill it and if it's a pet rabbit then first you need to check with local SPCA or animal lost and found sites to see if anyone has lost their rabbit. If you mean by starving that it's thin then you need to get it vet checked as it likely has an underlying health problem (and even if it's just lack of food, this causes health problems in rabbits). I think your best bet is to take it to an animal shelter and tell them you are interested in rehoming it if nobody claims it-they can check for owners and it will get the vet and health care it needs, and hopefully get well enough for you to take on as a pet.|`|5TM9P8tsaa	*Rabbits do not starve that is used to and born into the wild. It has I.S.S. or something wrong. It needs a vet that treats rabbits. Just to try to keep it and feed it when it is sick, will just die. I am sorry. At least your heart was in the right place. But then again there is such thing as Devine Intervention. Good Luck.|`|YpEswTQdaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  For starters,intestinal parasites may cause thinness & ill health,it may not just be a hungry bunny! I would take it along to a Rescue shelter,such as the RSPCA or ASPCA,as they will do health checks & tests on the Rabbit,or take it along to a Vet. If it really IS starving,its not a good idea to give 'plenty' of food-straight away,since its stomach won't be able to cope with it. Also over feeding rabbit mix or pellets may cause intestinal disturbances,buy some Meadow or Timothy hay & some good rabbit mix or pellets,try to buy a 'Dwarf & Junior' one since some have Prebiotics in which should help to calm his stomach. Only feed 1/2 a handful,every day to start of with & increase after the 2nd day to 3/4 handful,IF the rabbit shows NO sign of intestinal disturbances. Feed plenty of hay,this in theory shouldn't affect him or her.<br>  <br>  Good luck & well done for taking an abandoned bunny in! Please feel free to email me if you need any help,xxx|`|Hwybmzg5aa	feed it vegetables and bunny food mix and hay and give it water.|`|5M57TTfpaa	give her unlimited hay, and about a cup of pellets a day.|`|pDv13gJwaa	a wild bunny??? no way, set it free|`|hoOygDw1aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  You're right, feeding her a lot right away will make her sick. I would buy her some plain rabbit pellets (without little treats mixed in) and some rolled oats (regular, uncooked Oatmeal is fine).<br>  <br>  The general rule of thumb is to feed 1/2 cup of pellets per 5 lbs. body weight. However, if she is starving, this won't work. So I'd start out by offering her about a cup of pellets daily, sprinkled with a layer of the rolled oats. Also offer her unlimited fresh water and unlimited timothy hay daily (not alfalfa, which is too high in calcium).<br>  <br>  Pellets, oats, and timothy hay are all available at Walmart and are not all that expensive.<br>  <br>  If she was found outside, there is a good chance she will need to be wormed as well. Do you live close to a Tractor Supply store? If so, see if you can find the 0.5% Fenbendazole, alfalfa-based worming pellets, made for cattle (a store clerk may be able to help you find this). You will be able to get a good-sized bag of these for about $5. They look and smell just like regular food pellets. If she is a very small rabbit, feed her about 4-6 of these daily, and if she is large, feed her 6-8 daily. Continue this treatment for 3-4 days. This should successfully worm her. If she is not suffering from parasites, it is at least a good preventative.<br>  <br>  Good luck with her! And let me know if I can help you further. You should be able to e-mail me through my profile.|`|VYTWizovaa	Put it in an enclosure, (big as possible, eg. cage, upturned box etc) on some grass. This way it will eventually relax and eat all it wants to and is good for it.  Do not worry if it will not eat immediately; if it's wild it could take it a few hours to relax in an enclosed environment. During this time, just leave it alone, do not agitate it, try to catch it or try to stuff grass in its mouth.<br>  <br>  Also, I would recommend you don't try and keep it as a pet; nurse it back to health and then set it free again. If you intend to return it to the wild, try to refrain from handling it as it will have a better chance in the wild if it's not used to human contact.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, good luck. Btw, how do u know it's starving??<br>  Caroline<br>  xx

9kTejB0uaa	CH means the dog gained Championship status.<br>  <br>  In the UK you need to put 3 Challenge Certificates (CCs), given at Championship Shows, on a dog for it to become a Champion.  Far easier said than done with the numbers being shown in most breeds.<br>  <br>  And in the UK again, these CCs are awarded for the Best Dog, and the Best B itch, at shows when CCs are on offer.  Not all Championship Shows award CCs in every breed.  These awards are made ahead of BOB, Group or BIS placings.|`|um5CVvTfaa	CH is champion... and it depends on what country you are in to what the requirements for CH are.  In the AKC, you need 15 points, and two of those wins must be majors (3,4, or 5 pts).  IT doesn't mean winning BIS or even BOB-- you get points winning Winners B*tch and Winners Dog.|`|P2yRAWiJaa	Don't get ahead of yourself here.  :)<br>  <br>  Yes, the CH stands for "champion". It's a point based system.<br>  <br>  Depending on how recent those champions are will help you figure out if you could have a ch quality pup.|`|C1eHfhrHaa	Champion!  You don't have to be best in show or even bestof breed to be a champion.  You only need 15 points and 2 majors which a dog earns by being either winners ***** or winners dog.|`|KuUx34hCaa	YES YES & YES|`|qapJU3tMaa	Wow, please repost with some punctuation then I'll read your question.|`|PHhX2z22aa	Yes: each dog name with a CH beside it means that dog earned champion rank in an AKC or CKC dog show.

ChhheTSbaa	Wow... a lot of people seem to be having this problem right now.<br>  The solution is relatively simple.<br>  As soon as your kitten bites or scratches you, put it down from your lap or away, and ignore it completely.<br>  This is exactly what it's litter mates would do; stop playing with it because the game is not fun anymore.<br>  When playing with it, never use your hands as "prey" but always use a toy- even for luring it to you, do not ever use your moving fingers.<br>  By applying these simple things, the kitten should understand quickly that biting means: no play, no cuddles, (and those are what a kitten loves best of all) and that hands are not to play with.<br>  Don't (ever) punish physically, that will only scare it- it's still very young and easily impressed.<br>  <br>  I'm just here to help, so I hope the original questioner doesn't mind........These should be useful for every new cat owner though.<br>  To the answerer - became questioner below (ha, I should take this trick from you, no points lost :))<br>  Your cat has developed a habit already. The signal you give off might have to be a little stronger. It does sound like play though, not agression, it's just that your cat doesn't know where the boundaries are. Was it separated from it's mom and siblings (too) young?<br>  First I would like to suggest that you create a set playtime.<br>  So, let's say, make it playtime after you wake up and right before you go to bed. Make it so that the cat counts on it. Play for half an hour or so, exclusively with toys (toys on a stick, whether feathers, fur balls or fabric "snakes", or toys you can throw are ideal to avoid her from targeting you), get all the tension out. If she becomes physical with you, stop and ignore. Don't play until next scheduled playtime again.<br>  <<Sometimes cats need to be enticed to play, especially when getting older, they can have a lot of toys but if they're sitting still they're just boring to them (she might just have exces energy that she needs to get out, but only enjoy interactive play with you- or another cat, which is my best idea so far :)). Hiding some of the toys and switching around, enhancing with catnip or valerian might make them a little more tempting to play with on her own (they are new each time and they smell irresitable). Hiding her food (if kibble) around the house will keep her busy hunting for food, and you could keep her mind occupied by starting clicker-training (info can be found online).>> <br>  This ignore policy could take some time for her to understand, or she might just not care.<br>  If she doesn't get it after a couple of weeks, instead of ignoring her, try putting her in a seperate room for a little while (10 minutes or so will do I think) for time out. After those 10 mins. or so, let her out but don't make contact while you're doing it, and playtime is over until the next session.<br>  The above has worked with cats I know, my own have never bitten anyone (not even a "lovebite" i'm afraid) but I'm not a behavioral therapist- I just care about keeping my own cats happy and social and want to help.<br>  If the problem persists, just give somebody that is a call- there might be other solutions I don't know of.<br>  They will all tell you not to spray water or use your hands or voice while "disciplining" though.<br>  Good luck to you too.|`|358dfc72a0ca570b60f34a434c95901baa	Ok, I need help too.  My cat is 8 months old and still does this.  I don't want to hurt her because she will not understand why I am doing it.  I have bite marks all over my legs and arms too.  Whenever I kiss her she bites me HARD on the face.  (guess she does not like it).  When I walk down the hall, she attacks my legs and bites them.  I have bite marks and even a bruise where she was playing really rough.  I could never hurt her though.  I say no and walk away.  I am even in The ASPCA...Amercian Society for the Prevention againist Cruelty to animals.  I always joke that there should be an organization where humans are abused by their animals.

Unfortunately she is a baby and doesn't understand that it hurts her mummy when she scratches her. Try buying her some cheap toys, like small balls, bits of string, things that she can attack instead of you.<br>  Remember she is still only a baby and she must love you very much if she wants to be near to you all the time.<br>  Believe me, my legs look like a pin cushion, my kittens (I breed Siamese) climb all over me and cut their teeth on my fingers.

fbTKGr0Aaa	Lots of water! Bring ice cubes even though they will melt  you will still have water. I would also look into either a cooling vest, blanket or bandanna as they tend to overheat especially when excited. From my experience I would get the vest as non of my dogs will lay on the cooling blanket. I have also seen bully people bring along big disposable cooking trays they use as Minny pools. I also have a waist clipping leash so I can be hands free at events Im attending with my pups and I think a puppy playpen is a great idea if your not sure how your pet will act at an event and if he/or she may need an area to hang out in. If you dont know where to find these things try ebay. Have a GREAT time!

JrnXCy49aa	If she is indoors you can take off her collar, but rather wait for her to heal properly, she'll most likely get excited and might tear her stitches.|`|AA10794514	Sure you can play with her gently. Why take off her collar and risk her disturbing her stitches. I don't think that is a good idea.|`|VzMmxJsOaa	sure, dogs are usually fine in a day or two. just pick her up carefully so that the stitches don't come out. it shouldn't matter whether the collar is on or off. As long as you know the dog is not chewing at her stitches. Keep in mind that she will be pretty tired though and will probably want to sleep most of the time.
