I turned 13 today and I know that 13 y/o's are allowed on myspace...You just have to make your page private. But for some reason it won't let me change my age to 13 because it's under 18!! So please don't be like,    "It's against the rules."   Because my friend is thirteen and it says so on her page.    So, any really big myspace geniuses...Do you know a code to change your age? thanks a MILLION(:

20090225101254AAysJlh	Computers & Internet;Software	Photoshop animation problem?	I've got Adobe Photoshop CS3, full version. I heard that ImageReady was discontinued, and a lot of people now recommend Fireworks or something. I don't really want to spend a hell of a lot of money on that. My flash trial ended a longgggg time ago. When I try animating with what I've already got on Photoshop, it fails. I go on a the second frame for example and try to draw something different from the whatevers in the first frame, but they both change the same automatically. Like, say I drew a tree in frame 1, and I then drew a flower in frame 2, frame 1 would show the flower and the tree that was originally in it would be gone.      I kind of do want to animate with photoshop, but if there's a program anywhere that allows you to do friendly gif animations of pixel drawings that are also compatible with transparency, that'd be awesome.   But I bet theres no such thing. D:   ><   Or, if theres a way to fix that frame problem thing I have in photoshop - that'd also be great. :3

Also, anything that, in the final product, it will say something like "Unregistered" or "Software X" in big letters, blocking view of my video, I do not want.   If it's minimal and in the corner such as in "Unregistered by HyperCam2", if you know what I'm talking about, that's fine. As long as it's a minimal.      Most importantly, I NEED it to be a full-sized version with no watermarks on the final video, at least.   Thanks!! :)

What can I do so that Ares or LimeWire CANNOT be downloaded again by my stupid, idiot jerk of a roomate?      Thanks !!

Yet you can transfer any amount of money on the same site, in a secure manner.      First, what does the bank have to do for email to make it secure?      Secondly, presumably it is possible to do this, so why don't the banks do it?      Regards.

I have tried both 2gb with the 512&2gb combo and they both work.      Also the 2gb sticks work on their own.      Another weird thing is when i put a 512 in one slot and a 2gb in the other, the laptop wont boot, but if i switch the slots they are in, it will work. Same thing with the single 2gb setup. In one slot the 2gb will work but in other it will not.      What is happening?

About a week ago, my iPod froze while I was listening to music so I connected my iPod to my computer (Mac OS X 10.4.11) to unfreeze it--something I always do--however, this time, iTunes told me that the iPod was corrupt and that I should restore it. I didn't restore it because I have none of my music, movies, podcasts, etc. on my computer and it would take at least a month to get everything back. I disconnected the ipod and let the battery die, the charged it on my dock. When I reconnected to iPod to iTunes, iTunes froze and has been freezing every time since then. I even re-downloaded iTunes (twice!) to see if that would help. Advice?

20090227161810AA7kQ6n	Computers & Internet;Other - Computers	How do I fix my laptop that gets really slow at strange times?	Lately my laptop has been coming close to freezing every time I open a game or memory/CPU intensive programs or try watching videos online. at first it would only get slow when ever I watched videos on a specific site, then it started to get slow when I used other programs, now it gets slow on a few more programs and on any online videos. It seems to be getting worse all the time.      By slow I mean that my mouse becomes extremely laggy and it looks as though the web browser has to redraw the webpage when I try to scroll. Oddly enough when I use the touchpad build into my laptop the mouse will move perfectly fine while the usb mouse will be really laggy. The only real way I can temporarily fix it is to close the program that caused it and to end the process tree for explorer then wait 2-5 minutes and restore explorer.       The laptop I use is the Dell Latitude D600, and its battery is practically dead. It only stays charged for roughly 20 minutes and has an annoying red blinking light that won't go away. I still have 27 GB free space on my C: drive. I tried doing a system restore but it would only take my computer back about 3 weeks where as it has had this problem for about one and a half months. I've also tried to fix my registry through a few free registry fixers but to no avail. I'm also positive I don't have any viruses or anything.      So, any ideas?

20090227173057AAGVCuY	Computers & Internet;Software	Vista is telling me my product key is invalid?	I recently purchased a computer from a family friend, and up until just very recently it was functioning perfectly. The computer's original Operating System was Windows XP, but the friend upgraded the hardware and software to run Vista for me.       Earlier today, I noticed the CD-ROM drive was acting a little strange, which he warned me it might, and replaced it with the new, backup CD-ROM drive he had given me. I booted up the computer, the CD-ROM drive installed and worked perfectly, until I shut down the computer and turned it on later this evening, when I got the message that my Windows Vista Home Basic product key was invalid for activation. I do not have the product key, though I believe it could be easily obtained over the phone, but either way I am aware Vista can only be activated once. I do have, in my possession, an installation disc for Windows XP but I am not exactly in any hurry to downgrade my system.      I am now only able to access my computer with limited functionality, and am repeatedly offered to purchase a new product key. Though, I don't quite understand how simply shutting down the computer, and re-booting it could...somehow cause a product key to become invalid. Does anyone know what may have caused this, and what a cost-free solution might be?

Then, a microsoft security scanner pops up and starts scanning our computer saying there are 21 viruses on it. We then went to norton anti virus which said we have no viruses.       The only way we got to the internet was because there is a link to microsoft.com at the bottom of the first virus scanner, but other then that, there are no icons or taskbar even when you exit the virus scanner and the only way to turn of the computer is ctrl alt del.      any ideas?         thankyou      xxxxxxx

Pues resulta que TODOS esos contactos de mail son mios!!! alguien copió (o se robó) exactamente mi lista de contactos y les envio ese mail publicitando un evento!    Alguien sabe como es posible que hayan podido acceder a mi lista de contactos? Casi nunca mando FW y cuando mando alguna información a varios destinatarios utilizo BCC no me gusta spammear a mis contactos, asi que no hay forma que YO voluntariamente haya proporcionado esa información privada y absolutamente personal.      Saben si es un delito?? O como pudieron conseguir mi lista de contactos??      GRACIAS

20070430201903AAQhC6B	Computers & Internet;Software	Excell: Sheets within Sheets?	Hey,      I have been asked to make an Excell spreadsheet for a guy at work. He wants multiple sheets on the first page. Like a workbook within a workbook. So you can use tabs (perferably on the side) to jump between the sheets for each day of the week.      At the bottom, where the standard tabs are - he wants to be able to change between the weekly sheets, and some other sheets he has in mind.      He described it as a 3D spreadsheet, with sheets within sheets.      Any ideas how to do it or where to find out how?      Cheers,      JP

20070516210624AAqlPgQ	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	SQL question - select most recent records for each computer?	I have a Postgres database that gets a new record every time someone logs in to a computer on our network.      Each computer (hostname) has multiple entries.       But what I often want is to only work with the most recent entry for each computer.      Say I want to select all the distinct homepages from the most recent entries for each computer. How can I do this in just sql?      The part I have trouble with is how to select the most recent entries for each hostname.      Anyone able to help?      Cheers.         Example Table 'logs'      ID | HostName | time | username | homepage            Select only the latest record ids for each HostName         Example Data:   1 | PC001 | 6:30 | dofus | www.telstra.com   2 | PC002 | 5:50 | Yankyman | www.foolsrus.com   3 | PC001 | 5:40 | dofus | www.telstra.com   4 | PC003 | 5:34 | jerry | www.eatmyshorts.com   5 | PC001 | 5:31 | clinton | www.yahoo.com   6 | PC004 | 5:23 | bossman | www.bofh.com         What I want is records 1, 2, 4, and 6.
20070531182727AArICtC	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Postgres - any way to prevent it from needing a specific host to connect?	Ok - I am builing a webserver. Fedora Core 9 running a LAPPstack setup.      I have it running - but all the old scripts (written by other people) connect to the database using pg_connect("dbname=???_logs port=5432 user=???")   But they dont specify a host=localhost.      If I add the localhost to the string, it works - but I dont want to have to do that for all the scripst (as there are hundreds of them) - so my question is how to set up PHP/Postgres so it defaults to localhost, as the old server obviously did.

I received an IM (from someone that I don't know) telling me that one of my contacts is a fraud, and account hacker.   How can I tell if this info is true.
