2fqXT9W6aa	Homebrew, for any console, is an application or game for that console. They're legal and usually free, just put them on your SD card like you would with a normal .nds file. They aren't official games but something someone's made themselves (hence the name "homebrew"). Some recommended homebrew apps & games for DS are:  LMP-NG (an iPod clone for DS)  DSorganize (has a web browser, IRC client and other useful tools)  Pocket Physics (a fun sandbox physics game)  StillAlive DS (The game Portal for DS)  Animanatee (a flickbook type animation maker)  Colours! (painting application)|`|NRhrO833aa	Nintendo DS home-brew is software written for the Nintendo DS by hobbyist programmers, as opposed to a software/game production company. Software is typically written using unofficial development kits and is used on the DS via third-party rewritable game cartridges.    This stuff can also be considered illegal if not licensed
YpyrBZCYaa	When you put a Pokmon up for trade on the GTS, on the main menu where you can search for Pokmon, go to the option that says "Summary". When you're there, press "A" once, and choose "Take back" to get your Pokmon back.  Besides from cheating, you can get more Master Balls by winning the lottery at the Jubilife T.V. Station. If the lotto number matches the Trainer ID number on one of your Pokmon, you'll get a Master Ball. Hope this helped and good luck!|`|40ObXE0caa	For getting you're Pokemon back:  1. log onto the GTS  2. hit "Summary"  3. hit the A button and it should say "take back" and "leave as is"  4. hit take back    For getting more Master Balls:  Look, I'm to lazy to type out the whole thing so go to http://www.geocities.com/pokemondigimon6... and click on cheats. Its on the first page. It's called "GTS Cloning Glitch"|`|CQbnR2Zmaa	Yes just login into the GTS then when it comes up press a on Summary and when the pokemon comes up press a and take it out    You get more Master Balls if you can match all the numbers in Jubilife City Lottery  match 1   Contest accesory  2 s PP up  3 s Esp Share   4 s dont know  5 s Master ball

2dxJjh6faa	Yes u have to go to a community lot to do a resturant|`|22oG4Rs0aa	You must be on a community lot to use the industrial stove.   Also, your sim's home business can't be a restaurant.  I found that out the hard way after I had spent hours building a restaurant for my sims' home business. Then I couldn't find the podium thingy for the host to seat guests. And there were no guests to be seated anyway. They wouldn't recognize it as a restaurant.    Hope this helps and Happy Simming.

MKZyKVWLaa	PC is still kicking and will never die.   Computer gaming has had a bit of a slow year, because it seems every PC Developer has decided that MMORPGs were free money (except forgot the part where making an inferior WoWclone won't take customers away from WoW).    I'd say give the companies a year or two to realize they can't compete in the MMO market without making something better (or at least different) than WoW, and we'll be back on track.     Blizzard is going to have a great few years with some more WoW expansions, Starcraft 2, and Diablo 3.  You've also got Valve around; everything they make ends up cool.     Another interesting fact that guarantees the survival of the PC as a gaming machine is the fact that Mouse/Keyboard is the best system of input. You'll never have anything close to the levels of control attainable with a console as you do with a Keyboard/Mouse and computer.     Of course, Consoles get their exclusives and great games, but so does the computer. Honestly, if you have a PS3/360 (either/or) and a decent computer, you have access to everything worth playing right now.     While it would be silly to say Piracy hasn't made PC less appealing (considering it's fairly difficult to pirate console games but PC games are just a straight download), it would also be silly to say that's singlehandedly killing the industry. If anything, anti-piracy measures are hurting it more. The amount of people that downloaded a hacked version of Spore just to spite SecuROM is astounding.     TLDR version: MMOs killed computer gaming, but it'll be back when companies realize they aren't Blizzard.|`|jYEbbrcaaa	Wii owners have the same problem, waiting for titles released on the 360 and PS3 for months, and that's a console.    I don't see why people prefer to play the versions for the pc when it's much easier (at least for me) to use the console controller and play it on a TV. I would just get a console if I were you, but I've never liked pc games that much anyway. Just play pc only games on your pc and get a console for the games you don't want to miss.|`|Tr0DeLY9aa	Is it dying? No  is it dead? No    PC games are doing better now then they have in the past 4-5 years.   Consoles will always seem to be more popular because of the cost efficiency compared to building a kick-*** gaming rig. But (at least for me) if the game doesnt get released on the PC. im not gonna be playing it.|`|RAw3mZkQaa	I used to be a die hard PC gamer who hated consoles.  However I now own a 360 and rarely use my pc for gaming.    Personally I got sick of the expense of upgrading my pc constantly to keep up with games.  You upgrade your pc with latest tech and it's already outdated by the time you've put it together.  This is due to the exponential nature of computer technology development.  With my 360 it has cost me 200 for a top of the line premium, I know that it will play every 360 game I throw at it without slowing down or throwing errors at me, and I know that I will have absolutely no trouble playing multiplayer with my mates due to the seemless live integration that microsoft has catered for.    The other thing is that consoles are so cheap relatively that when a 720 comes out I can just stick my 360 on the side and get a new console which will last for another 4-5 years, with no extra cost aside from games after the initial purchase.    As you have said games developers seem to be devoting less time to PC gaming as time goes on.  This is due to several reasons including the piracy you mentioned.  Whilst a lot of PC gamers do not like to hear it, it has to be said that piracy is having an affect on it, and if unchecked by the community will slowly kill it.  If you were a developer what would you rather put most of your resources into?  Consoles where you know that under 1% of owners have the capacity to pirate your games because they would require modded consoles, or PC gaming where probably closer to 30/40% if not more people simple download titles?  The answer speaks for itself.    Crysis was good but the developers intended it more as a tech demo than a game really, and it hasn't exactly gotten them very far because the engine caters to such a low percentage of computers relative to other engines that hardly any other developers are taking it over the unreal 3 engine.    I don't think PC gaming has died, but it is definately dying as more people translate over to consoles.

It also could be that they had a problem contacting your bank. Make sure your Pay-pal account is Verified before trying again. Personally, I use an Ultimate Gaming prepay card instead of credit transactions to pay for the subscription :). I hope this answers your question.|`|JH68uuiMaa	If Jagex is saying that you have negative credit, that means that they didn't receive the money.  This means that most likely, the payment was unable to go through or was canceled.  I would check to make sure that you have the money in your Paypal account or your Bank account if that is where the Paypal takes the money from.  Also check the records and see if $15 or whatever the amount of money is was taken from your account and also if it was ever refunded.  If your Paypal/Bank account has $15-20 less than what it did before you did this, I would suggest contacting Jagex about the issue.  If you did get the money back or were never charged for it, I would suggest either trying again, or taking the money out and using a different way to pay for membership such as Prepaid Gaming Cards.

0af7c8af45c772ad750996038c21d9daaa	The free version of no$gba cannot determine the save type of each game. You need to go to the option menu and change the save type, then reset the emulator and try to save. If it fails again, try a different save type. Note that for each DS game, only 1 save type will work, the rest will give you errors when you save.    Or, try to use no$gba version 2.6a, which automatically detects the save type for all games.

jYEbbrcaaa	Camping spots are in most shooter games. It's basically a spot where a player can go and see a lot of the stage, and kill people without dieing themselves. It's an easy spot to get kills.    Check out the source I gave, it explains it better than i did.|`|zYs9E46waa	A camping spot is a corner or hiding place, where there is lots of traffic and lots of room to get kills. COD4 for example, on Strike (place with broken helicopters), and camp spot would be on top of the highest building with the fence around it, or on WetWork, the cabins on each end of the ship (sniper's heaven)|`|0Ead5iQSaa	In the online RPGs that I play, it is where you hang out to kill a notorious monster. People "camp" in one spot. They wait for the monster to spawn. It spawns once an hour. The item it drops is worth a lot on money in game. So people just sit there waiting for it. They kill it, walk away from the game for an hour, then come back and wait till it pops again. They do this all day. That's why it is called camping. People hate campers, because it doesn't let people that might need the item for a quest get it. The people camping just want it to sell it.

vf2AUsMqaa	Well...I think the design is really nice in itself and I'd say a tattoo of the triforce is a cool thing to have. However, putting it on the back of her hand? Probably not the best idea. For those who don't know what it is, she'll always be asked about it and that could get pretty annoying.    My vote (though I'm not your friend, obvs) is for someplace a little less conspicuous. Ankle seems really cool, or even on her shoulder blade. In general, I think a tattoo on the back of your hand's kind of an iffy choice.    Long live Zelda. :)|`|E2Zr6tTpaa	yea!!!|`|6ATQIvoYaa	it doesnt matter what others think of it as long as she thinks it is cool|`|E3yOmel9aa	no|`|AhO0Uoppaa	any tattoo on your hand is crazy and zelda? not even gonna comment|`|UlrvomV5aa	uhm..... the triforce? isn't that a little obsessive?! i mean thats where evry1's triforce is n zelda. on their hand...|`|Cq5y5cgJaa	yea! thats cool! u shold get it in white ink if possible!|`|yMbmoIf8aa	yeah it would be tight. but may be confused for like some secret society masonic symbol type ish o.O|`|2wpPrmibaa	yeah, and is awesome how you do triforce in the computer|`|jVQ58AMFaa	ya that would be awesome!!!!! zelda rocks!!!!!!1|`|vb71s7slaa	Wow that we let me now your the ultimate legend of zelda fan!    Do what your heart wants  Mine Says HECK YA!|`|NRhrO833aa	While the symbol itself is very neat looking, It would be wise to take into consideration of the times and era before accepting a real tattoo, and that goes for all. 30 years from now, would your friend want to show it to everyone, or would it be personal? It all depends on the reality my friend.|`|jYEbbrcaaa	She should be a bit more original, since a lot of people get Triforce tattoos.     But if she doesn't care about how many people have it, the hand would be an awesome spot for it.|`|Rd3Mj3O9aa	ive seen it it doesnt look bad.|`|jxKmuzSSaa	That would be weird and your friend would be a subject of ridicule for anyone who knows what the triforce is which is pretty much everyone. But if she insists on getting it then put it somewhere less "showy". and not on the back of her neck unless she plans on wearing turtleneck sweaters for the rest of her life.|`|VIUm00Ebaa	Tattoos shouldn't be about what others think    But my opinion is   If you really like video games thy much sure|`|vk6sczbLaa	That really depends on how big a fan of Zelda she is. I'm assuming she's a pretty huge fan if she wants to get a tattoo for it.    If I were to see a triforce on someone, it'd have to look pretty intricate in order to not look silly. If she got it with the eagle, like this http://www.brandsoftheworld.com/brands/0... I think it'd look neat. However, while looking for pictures I saw a tattoo exactly like that. So it's up to her if she wants a tattoo that won't be unique.    She also needs to think about, "How will I feel about this tattoo in a couple of years?" If she brings up the option of getting it lasered off, then she shouldn't get a tattoo in the first place.
Wdhr3j37aa	EA issued a statement ages ago saying it was feb the 20th 2009 but there have been rumours lately that it might be pushed back. some of the websites say june or july, some say march but there has been no official announcements yet as to if there is a delay or not. EA have responded to say however that the release date is under review so there could be a delay.    google Sims 3 delay for more info but be aware it is mosty rumours. here is the site that informs of the  EA response, etc     http://www.totalvideogames.com/The-Sims-...|`|Ta7aaDxnaa	Release Date: February 20, 2009 (UK)    I found this on IGN.com|`|29zyJ95Eaa	The Sims 3 is 100% officially released on February 20th.

MKZyKVWLaa	It is true that Mages have been vastly improved in the last patch, but saying that they're easy and fast to level isn't saying much. EVERYTHING levels with relative speed and absurd ease.     All of the talent specs are viable, but Arcane seems to be a tad stronger than the rest.     If you're trying to level as fast as you can, I'd avoid professions entirely until you're 80. If you still want to deal with them,knowing that they will slow you considerably, I'd go with First Aid (obviously) and Herb/Anything. Herbalism is quite profitable right now, and gives you a pretty nice Heal over Time spell. For your second profession, Alchemy/Tailoring/Inscription are all fair choices, as well as Enchanting (but not being able to craft Disenchantable items will moderately hinder it.)    As far as class... wait, what? Mage. Mage is your class.   I'll assume you meant Race. You can't really go wrong with Alliance races; Draenei has a handy HoT and +Hit, Gnomes have bonus Int and Escape Artist, and Humans get +Reputation +Stealth Detection and temporary immunity to things that cause loss of control of your character. For PvP, Human is easily the best, and for PvE Draenei and Humans are pretty close. Gnomes are the weakest of the three, but it still wouldn't be horribly detrimental to choose them if you like them.     As far as gear goes, until you're high level (65+) and looking to do harder (a relative term) instances, the only stat you'll care about stacking is Spellpower. If it adds to your damage, you want it. Intellect and Stamina are fine, but Spellpower makes leveling absurdly fast.|`|btJo2cB4aa	Undead mage destruction. Allows you to blow everything up and summon stuff, but spells are hard to get.|`|Tr0DeLY9aa	In my opinion mages suck  if you want fast easy leveling, roll a hunter  but if you are going to roll a mage anyways    Frost for PvP  Fire for leveling/PvE    Proffesions: Herbalism and Tailor (herbalism for lifeblood heal spell and money)  Race: any|`|duwbsslKaa	I rolled a mage when I started and i've never looked back =]    Looking to return to him now WOTLK is out.    Anyway specs I would go are.    Frost or Fire for PvE [Not much difference at lower levels]  60+ Arcane+Fire for endgame and further leveling. [Arcane for spellpower etc]  70/80 Same same the above, haven't had much chance to test new spells etc because I haven't started yet but that seems to be the way most mages go for endgame etc.    Profs, I recommend Tailor/Other Some of the best BOP items for mage are tailored I am also enchanter which is ok but you can pay others to enchant for you.  Finally I recommend Gnome, for Intel bonus really. Only go human if you plan to make use of perception.    Anyway I hope that helps. =]

It's pretty much the same as the first with more characters and the option of really customizing your team. You can pick three different side kicks and your captain. I'd recommend picking sidekicks that pick up where your captain falls short. I use Yoshi as my captain with Boo,Dry Bones and Hammer BrolI do go online but the problem is you can only play with people in your region which stinks|`|jYEbbrcaaa	It's not that much different than the first.

Tr0DeLY9aa	Kijuju is a region in Africa, with a native language of Swahili. Due to it's language, it is likely part of an east African nation. The three likely locations are: Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda.    In the mid naughties, TriCell Pharmaceutical Company; under guidance of Albert Wesker, released a virus into the region. The infected began violent convulsions, before becoming primitive, savage beasts.    The B.S.A.A., under command of Chris Redfield, was sent to the region to investigate.

sALHaWpbaa	If your a holy paladin your going to be looking for intellect and spell power on a weapon not really damage.  Usually its going to be a 1 handed weapon so u can use a shield that also gives spell power, intellect and stamina as well.  Intellect increases your mana pool(u have to have mana to heal) and also raises your spell crit chance, spell power makes ur heals heal more and damage dealing spells like holy shock hit for more.  Stam gives you more health.  Another advantage of the 1 h weapon and shield is it increases your armor in case something slips past the tank and hits u, gives u more survivability.|`|1G3XPiq3aa	Mace is more likely to have decent stats on it for healing.|`|2059629ba703ea51b813a449b0cb4431aa	There is no single "best" weapon for any class in WoW, except for Rogues and knives.

Shoot some rounds at him (whatever guns more powerful) and when he starts to charge at you eclectro bolt him (this will stun him) use this to shoot and run away from him and repeat.    By the way, if he throws a grenade at you use telekinesis on it (while it's in midair) and throw it at him.

Basically you don't even know if the person can hear you or not.|`|dHQtZEZNaa	Haha, I joined that site as a joke to mess around with people, and I think they go through the names of people signing up and approve/reject names if it is inappropriate.

y69KW67Eaa	Call of Duty 4: Modern Wardare. Ahhh great game indeed.     Okay okay, there's 3 versions to this game, Xbox 360, PS3 and the PC.     Starting with the Xbox 360:  Okay okay, it really depends how deep or where the scratch stretces to, if the scratch get's onto the reflective, colourfully, shiny, bit then you've got a chance that it will indeed fail on you. But you no the way there's this see-through ring around the hole in the middle? Well, if it's only that that's scratched then you should be okay.     PS3:  You cannot scratch Blu-Ray discs unless you really really scrape it with something sharp. So if you have a PS3 version it should be ok.    PC:  I'm not so sure about a PC version myself... hmmmm well my sims 2 disc has loads of these scratch marks on it... but I don't use it much since I've got all these expansion packs I don't use the main disc as much...but hey I'm getting off the point here.. emmm PC version should be fine. Shouldn't really affect your computer.     Overall your console should not brick or anything. And if it does freeze often, STOP playing it. It's just gonna get worse.|`|Wcr4UfTQaa	It shouldn't stop working. I had a scratch in the middle of my game, but it still worked. Sometimes, though, if it is scratched enough, it will stop working.|`|AAmuHOStaa	no if there is like a scratch and a part of the middle kind of broke then yes|`|0JMOJL3qaa	well if tha game works.. it should stay working as long as u dont get anymore scratches on it.|`|iBQJPx1Aaa	take it to gamecrazy at hallywood video and they can clear it for u it cost like $5|`|AA10711210	A scratch is usually enough to make a disc unreadable unless you can clean it off with a proper abrasive disc cleaner (hand-operated machine)|`|8gVobsg4aa	It depends how big/deep the scratch is.  If it's a small scratch then it should work fine.  But if this does happen again and the disc is cleaned it is probably because of the scratch.    If that is the case, you can now buy cod 4 for quite cheap because the next one has been released.    Hope it still works though :)

rnVdxXotaa	Double barrel is better as long as you use the quick reload perk    The Gewehr is better but both guns aren't that good, the STG or the steyr are much better.    Once you start doing prestige keep doing it until you get to the 10th, there's no point in starting to do it and then stopping at a certain level, its best to either stay at 65 without doing any prestiges or going all the way.    The best gun I think is the Type 100 with stopping power and the extended clip attachment for extra rounds. Steady aim and rocket launcher.|`|HfxE7SEwaa	1.

I'm gonna go ahead and recommend Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic, Jade Empire, and Mass Effect. They're all made by the same company, and all eerily similar, but they're also all damn fine examples of the RPG genre.     If you're interested in non-RPGs, I'd recommend Starcraft. It's $20 for Starcraft and it's expansion nowadays (11 year old games FTW), but it's still one of the greatest videogames of all time. The bonus there is that if you finish the singleplayer campaigns during your trip, you can come home, get online, and play the most balanced game in the world with a surprisingly high amount of people.|`|AA12059007	GTA 4   one rpg in action and Adveture.|`|oTWnXvFxaa	Fallout 3|`|gmkWJUAbaa	If you could get online you could try Gladiatus    Pretty good rpg...

EVjoCpjEaa	To level up crops, you'll need the seedmaker I'll assume you know how to get the maker machines. If not, here's a link:   http://www.fogu.com/hm6/chan2/makers.php    To level up your crops to level 2, you just plant multiple bags of seeds on top of each other. The more bags you plant on top of each other, the higher the chance they will level up.    When they're ready to be harvested, you'll get some crops at level 2.    Now throw those level 2 crops into the seedmaker, and you'll get level 2 seeds in return.    Plant multiple bags of level 2 seeds on top of each other, to get level 3 crops.    Repeat the process.     The highest level of crops is 100 ^_^. Yams are great to level up because they grow quickly.    Get the basement(s) as soon as you possible so you can plant crops all year round.

25h9yEfWaa	yes I will only post how to install custom firmware because it will not allow me to post something REALLY big so you can go to my website to look for other guides. (The links don't work but you can find the same files to download on the net) Please post on my website. It will take you to Goboardz sign up and you can post on any website (including mine)     --------------------------------------... Battery---------------------------------...  First you will need a pandoras battery. There are two ways of doing this.   1 Hard-modding   2 Soft Modding    Soft Modding is easy, but hard modding is hard. If you know somebody that has custom firmware (cfw) installed they can help you create a soft modded pandoras battery. I will show you how to make a hard modded battery. I have had bad experiences soft modding a battery. SO BE WARNED!!    You will need to have these materials to make a hard modded battery: A sharp knife, a safety pin, and a real Sony psp battery. You will need a safety pin because they are small and a normal pin won't work. Take your knife and cut through the sides of the battery. Make sure you go through the plastic because you will be opening it up. Don't cut yourself I have done that carelessly before, this takes time about 15-30 min. of cutting depending on how good your knife is. If you start to lose patience, just set it down and relax for awhile. It gets frustrating! The top part of the battery will come off after you cut it open. Take out the 4th pin here is a link to a picture that shows you where the 4th pin is. They will look different depending on what battery you are using.    Here is the PSP Slim battery pic.  http://i177.photobucket.com/albums/w206/...    Here is the Original PSP battery pic.  http://www.techknowsupport.com/brin/file...    Take the safty pin and lift up under the circled pin until it pops out.    If you open your psp battery up and then you see this on the top of the battery then ask me for help. I tried to get a picture of that battery I just couldn't find one. My advice for a pandoras battery, would to have two battery's because when you "pandoraize" your battery you cannot use it as a normal battery ever again. If you plug you psp into a wall using the charger WITHOUT the modded battery in, turn it on and then put the battery in you can use you battery normally until you turn it off.    After you have modded your battery it is now officially a PANDORAS BATTERY!!!    --------------------------------------... Memory Stick-----------------------------------...      NOTE: your memory card HAS to be Sony and it needs to be more 512mb or it WILL NOT work!!      To install the firmware you need a program on your memory card. This program makes your memory card a "Magic Memory Stick" or mms.    First you need this file:  http://www.zshare.net/download/506425677...      after you have the downloaded files we will make a magic memory stick! ( the easiest part)  - extract the The File You Need.7z to your desktop (use WinRAR)  - Open README 1st folder  - highlight and copy MSINST and MSPFORMAT FOLDER  - open My Computer  - Left Click the C: drive once (Note: if you double click, it will open C: drive)  - Now RIGHT Click on C: drive and PASTE  - format your memory stick thru your psp (Settings>System Settings>Format Memory Stick)  - once that is done, enable USB mode  - make note of your drive letter (usually E: or F)  - open up command propmt (click Start, select Run, type in cmd and hit enter_  - Type in the following command "CD C:\" (note: with-out quote mark) HIT enter  - type the following command "mspformat\mspformat.exe X" ( where X=psp drive letter) note: NO quotation  - hit enter button  - hit Y, then press enter  (for some people who are confused on this part, here is a side note: guess i wasnt clear enough, you type mspformat\mspformat.exe E if your drive letter is E, if it is another letter use that letter, then press enter, then hit y, then press enter again...sorry  - it should say "Drive succesfully formatted, and partition moved."  - disable USB mode, and take out the memory stick  - now re-insert the memory stick, and re-enable(this guide was made by hercules on pspmod.com) USB mode  - Now go back to the Desktop where you extracted the folder "The File You Need"  - double click it  - open the Despertar v3 folder, and copy its contents to your psp (just the contents, not the actual folder)  - now go back to your prompt window  - type the following command "msinst\msinst.exe X msinst\msipl.bin" (again where X=psp drive letter) note: NO quotation  - press Y and hit enter  - The last line should say " Write MS BOOT CODE "  - then type exit and enter  * you now have a magic memory stick!

QzD3rJtMaa	It's a huge possibility.  I did hear that the new banned list will dramatically impact Tele-DAD decks.    The reasons you gave are not the reason that they ban certain cards.  They ban cards based on how people are using them as well as the ease of using the cards.  Dark Armed Dragon is just way too easy to use and way too easy to OTK your opponent because of him.  If anything I sense a limitation of DAD, not a ban.  It's just way too easy to drop 3 Synchros and 2 DAD's in one turn.  I also sense the same thing for Teleport and maybe Plaguespreader Zombie.  Also some limitations on Allure of Darkness, D-Draw, and Malicious seem inevitable because 3 of each card is just retarded with how good all of them are.  That's just my opinion though.|`|XiOfPxpdaa	i don't think so eather i mean i've beten god cards menny times with a hero deck so i don't think DAD is that hard to beat unless they pull him out at the last minet when most of the cards in your deck are in the grave then that would be hard to beat.|`|yzpU5fZJaa	it's possible, but unlikely. dad is a 150$ card. if it is banned, kunami will lose a lot of money. mabey it will be limited, but not banned.|`|sjTMySUbaa	no|`|wTwC5ZAwaa	i think that elemental hero stratos will be banned because of it's effect to grab an elemental hero or destiny heroes.and dark armed dragon is very powerful i oulled one when i was 10 it has such a destructive effect being able to get a 2800 monster and be able to destroy any of your opponent's cards with one dark monster|`|EjamKiaeaa	No, I do not think that they are going to ban Dark armed dragon in the march 09 advanced format. However, I m 80% sure that they are gong to limit DAD to 1 per deck. Allure of darness to 2 per deck. etc|`|xB0vOgSwaa	crow maybe...divine no...it has a cost...solemn definitely not...dark armed...i hope he is limited... and maybe thunder king

Scroll down, stalemate is number 2 in ways to draw.  You are thinking of "insufficient force," the number 3 way to draw a game.|`|Kh4p4gPXaa	The guy above he has it pretty much right.    There is also a stipulation that if you are not checkmated in 50 moves after having your last piece taken (with only your king on the board)  then its a draw.   Making the exact same moves (on both sides)  three times in a row will also draw the game.|`|ihMNap2Uaa	yep king v king is stalemate (not king v other peices though also, if your in check, then move out, then your opponent puts you back in, and this cycle repeats a bunch, then it is a stalemate also|`|DhO1nBEIaa	1] When the 2 kings are left on the board, 2]when there is a king and a knight only added the opponent's king, 3]when there is a king and a bishop and the opponent's king, 4]and lastly when the opponent has no any more moves but not in check.|`|AA10248312	A stalemate occurs when:  1)  It is your turn to move  2) Your King is NOT in check  3) You have no legal moves available (in other words, any move you make would place your King in check)    If all three of these conditions apply, the game ends in stalemate.    A stalemate is a drawn game, regardless of any material advantage either player has.    ______________________________________...        A game is also drawn by "insufficient check-mating material" if neither you nor your opponent have sufficient material left in the game to force a checkmate.   This can happen, for example, with:    King against King  King and Bishop against King  King and Knight against King  King and two nights against King.    It is impossible to force checkmate in any of the above situations.    Having a King and a pawn against a King is considered sufficient checkmating material because the pawn can potentially be promoted.  So that situation needs to be played out until either the pawn is promoted and checkmate is produced, or the lone defending King is able to force a stalemate OR capture the pawn.    The minimum amount of material needed to force checkmate is:    King and Queen against King  King and Rook against King  King and two Bishops against King  King, Bishop and Knight against King  King and pawn against King (with Pawn eventually being promoted to Queen or Rook).    King and two Knights against King can not force a checkmate, although if the lone King moves into a corner at the wrong time, a checkmate situation could occur,  The key is that two Knights can't FORCE a lone King into a corner.     The King, Bishop and Knight against King is the toughest of these "basic" checkmates to learn.  But it's pretty cool once you do learn and understand how it works.
MK5Ddtiiaa	Check out Wikipedia or their website. There are fan sties too about it. Just google ballerina over the alligator. That is all I can tell you.

The Hollywood Backlot will be themed 1920s (as opposed to just Hollywood themed which isn't very cohesive). They are going to be adding a new land to the theme of Pixar Cars. Plus plans are underway to take out the Golden Dreams theater and put in a Little Mermaid attraction.
502b8fc880a1aac97ee1bcf5b79fd9e4aa	BoardGameGeek is a solid recommendation, however, as a game designer myself I'd recommend BoardGameDesignersForum www.bgdf.com. It'll provide you with everything you'll need to know concerning game submissions and such.|`|rgovWVP4aa	there is a manufactors called waddingtons who produce all types of games and are really big,, i have not checked out their website infact it would not surprize me if you have already played some of their games    good luck and also get it copy writed|`|jvuW18wvaa	I'd Definitely suggest that you check out BoardGameGeek (aka BGG, aka "The Geek"). BGG is simply The Best Online Resource for Game Info. Their datebase is Huge, and there are many great features to utilize - like reviews, sessions reports, photos and forums. You will have the experience and knowledge of many Members on your behalf.  http://www.boardgamegeek.com    Check out the BoardGameGeek Wiki - there you'll find All Sorts of info:  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/wiki/page/I...    You'll have to join this awesome group to gain full access to the resources, but BGG Membership is free and well worth the short amount of time it takes to join.    ALSO check out:  * Advice to Aspiring Game Designers:  http://www.thedicetower.com/misc/advice2...  It's a Great Read.    Regarding copyrighting a game:    * U.S. Copyright Office - Games  The idea for a game is not protected by copyright. The same is true of the name or title given to the game and of the method or methods for playing it.    Some material prepared in connection with a game may be subject to copyright if it contains a sufficient amount of literary or pictorial expression. For example, the text matter describing the rules of the game, or the pictorial matter appearing on the gameboard or container, may be registrable.  http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl108.html    * FAQ: Can I Copyright My Game?  According to the U.S. Copyright Office, "the text matter describing the rules of the game" ( http://www.loc.gov/copyright/fls/fl108.p... ) may be protected by copyright, depending on the literary content and other factors.  http://www.rpglibrary.org/articles/faqs/...    If you want to bring your board game to market, either find a game publisher willing to publish your game or self-publish it. Self-publishing will mean finding a manufacturer and funding to have the games made. Look for the best deal possible and seek out advice from other self-publishers.    Hope this helps - Good Luck!|`|rDcfw1Q8aa	Lily B pretty much nailed the available online resources.    I'd also advise making yourself familiar with how copyright and patent law works, as most boardgames tend to be covered by those laws.    Most board game producers do not accept unsolicited submissions, but a growing number will produce and distribute your game for your through licensing agreements.
OiXy3zaeaa	Go to the water front where the poor people live in the log huts.

Once you've given enough beggars enough money (1 gold each, once per beggar--won't work if you keep pumping the same guy in the same conversation!), the conversation option will come up.      A second option is to get arrested.  Steal something in an obvious fashion and let yourself get arrested.  While in prison, you will be visited by a "representative" of the Guild.    Finally, you can just metagame it and show up in the right place at the right time.  It's the "Garden of Dareloth", or the quasi-garden behind Dareloth's house in the Imperial City, roughly midnight-ish.  The game doesn't care, it'll just pick up the quest and run from there.|`|M3N92on8aa	you have to go to the water front at midnight and look for the three (i think three) people talking there should be one aragonian one redgaurd and i cant remember the last one.

She will give it to you if you go to sleep im not sure if you have to go to sleep in the imperial city. I know this because i am a part of the theives guild.

ysiE6IDjaa	Blenders are found under kitchens in buy mode. There is actuallly a picture of a blender in the catalog. You will find the blenders there.    To get a servobot you have to purchase the Non-Deadly Robot crafting station found under hobbies if you have Open for Business and have your Sim slave away at making robots until they earn a gold badge in Robotics, which will allow him/her to create the Servobot.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	Are you talking about the blenders that they use at a juice bar?  Because there are food processors found under the small appliances or in the kitchen section, but if you mean the blender to make juice, you have to buy a bar.  If you go into buy mode and click on Miscellaneous, you'll see a section that has party stuff, like balloons and the buffet tables.  There are also some bars in that section.  The bars have the blenders built into them.    I know you can also find them in some other section though.  I think it's under tables/counters maybe, can't remember right now.    Anyway, I just wasn't sure if you meant the food processor or the juice blender so I thought I would mentioned the bars too.

AA12357342	Scary? maybe you might re-think that and make it a girly girl sleep over and remember every girly girl sleep over ends with a super scary movie right? You could do that. Rent a very frightening movie or maybe two and watch them really late at night. Then you could tell scary stories if you want! I recommend the movie. Its always fun watching a movie with friends, especially if its a scary one! Oh and maybe watch it in a very dark room with chips and pop corn or stuff like that. Trust me, ITS FUN!|`|IRUa78qZaa	ouija board

MFAVIW1waa	Egg moves are moves that the baby pokemon can inherit from their father and their father alone. So if the mother has a move that you want the baby to have (that they can learn) it won't work. For example Buneary can learn the elemental punches (Thunder, Ice and Fire) But buneary can't learn them naturally (Leveling up) so you get a pokemon that is in the same egg group as buneary (Field, Human-Like). So in this scenario we take Hitmonchan (who is in the Human-Like Egg group. This makes them compatible) Hitmonchan is always male so you don't need to rebreed there. Now raise it to lvl 31 and teach it all the elemental punches. Now get a female buneary or lopunny and leave them at the day care. After a while collect the egg and run around to hatch it (put it beside a pokemon that has the ability Magma Armour or Flame Body to halve the hatch time. Note that the hatch time is the number of steps you take and not the number of minutes you play) When the egg hatches you'll get a baby buneary (The baby is always the first evolution of the mother, which in this case is buneary.) And now you check the moves and it should have the elemental punches and one of it's basic moves (Splash, pound, defence curl, foresight)     Egg moves vary depending the pokemon. Some don't have any egg moves. These are the genderless pokemon that can still breed (Magnezone, Starmie etc.) and some pokemon with one gender (Tyrouge, which is only male) and some bugs (caterpie, weedle etc.) You can't teach False Swipe to any pokemon only certain ones can learn it like Scyther and Sceptile. I'm not sure which pokemon can learn it as an egg move but i'll look it up)    Hope i helped! :)|`|HWtG9dkzaa	Baby Pokemon tend to learn the moves from their father - so you would have to breed a female pokemon with a male compatiable Pokemon (that knows the moves you want to be egg moves)    However - the baby needs to be able to learn that move as well - and working out who can and cannot learn is tricky.    Other Egg moves include:    Charmander learning Crunch  Squirtle learning Confusion.  Pidgey learning Faint Attack (when the father is a Murkrow)|`|YljHCeSUaa	Egg moves are moves most passed down from a Pokmon breeding pair to their offspring. This can happen in one of four different ways.     If both parents know one or more moves that their offspring could learn by leveling up, the offspring will have that move.   If the male Pokmon knows a TM or HM move that the offspring can learn, the offspring will have that move.   If the male Pokmon knows a move that the offspring can learn only by breeding. For example, if a male Dragonite knowing Outrage is bred with a female Charizard, the resulting Charmander will know Outrage.   All offspring Pokmon, in the absence of passed-down moves, will know at least one move when hatched, labeled in their level up move list as either "Start" or "--" in lieu of a level number. If these moves, together with the other egg moves obtained in the above ways, number more than four, then the moves on top of their level up move list (with "Start" or "--") will be the ones that do not show up.   Most online Pokdxes list moves from the third category as a Pokmon's Egg Moves. Before breeding a Pokmon, one must consider whether or not to use any Egg Moves in that Pokmon's moveset, and breed accordingly. To learn more than one Egg Move, since they are only passed on by the father, only a father Pokmon in the appropriate Egg Group that can legitimately have all of the moves in one moveset can be used. This makes certain combinations of Egg Moves impossible for certain Pokmon. Eg. Tentacruel has both Rapid Spin and Mirror Coat as available Egg Moves, but no Pokmon in the Water 3 Egg Group can learn both moves so Tentacruel can't use both in the same moveset.|`|ndOzqCEaaa	i'm pretty sure that it means that you can only get the move by breeding. Baby pokemon tend to learn moves one of that their parents know. hope that helps! :)|`|IJVHPVCraa	ok the pokemon u want to breed has to be a girl otherwise u wont get that that pokemon and u need a boy pokemon compatible with the girl pokemon with the move u want.  Put them in the daycare hatch the egg n wallaaa pokemon with that move prettyy kool ehh?

She can do it by hand but it can be much slower and cause frustration. A beginner's book would be nice but honestly she can find information online or join any of hundreds of quilting forums. Even I have one if she  is interested. We love to help new quilters. www.quiltangels.lefora.com    I would recommend a cutting mat, as big as possible. A rotary cutter, cautioning her they have a razor blade edge and do some serious damage if you are even slightly careless, and a quilter's ruler. I would suggest as long as the mat. I like the Olipfa rulers. Please don't get her a thin ruler as the rotary cutter will run up over the top of it and cut her. (Ask me how I know) Walmart has all of these items at a great price in their craft department.  She will also need some fabric. Preferably, 100% cotton.  Best of luck to her.  Debbe|`|CsCYgYylaa	I would go to JoAnne fabric and pick out a quilt book for beginners.  She will need a quilting ruler, cutting mat and a sewing machine.

eNHGiEvGaa	This is not a question of pot odds, but I'll get to that later.    I'm not sure why you're multiplying your number of outs by 4.  Maybe this is a shortcut you've learned somewhere?  I found that it's actually pretty close, so maybe you're onto something.  However, I looked at the situation and found that you overlooked the possibility of a running pair on the turn and river, which gives you slightly better than 7 outs.  Anway, you can think about it this way:    -What are your chances of NOT catching one of your outs on the turn?  We know 7 of the cards, there are 45 unknown, we've got 7 outs.  So the odds are 38/45 that we'll miss the turn.    -If you miss the turn, what are the chances that you'll also miss the river?  *Important NOTE*:  You've got more outs on the river because you can now win by pairing the turn too (running pair is good).  Now there are 44 unknown cards, 10 outs, chances to miss are 34/44.    -Multiply these to find the chances you'll miss both: 38/45 * 34/44 = approx. 65.3%    -Subtract from 1, and you get the odds that you will catch on one of the two streets.  That's 34.7%, which is quite close to to the odds calculated by the site above.    Note ALSO, that their calculation is more correct than mine, because I simplified slightly.  If the turn was an Ace or a Queen, you'd have 9 outs on the river instead of 10.    Now, if we had done the same calculation assuming exactly 7 outs on both streets, we'd come up with 29% which is quite close to the estimate you made... so I guess your shortcut is a very practical way to get a close estimate, and you just need to consider any extra/hidden outs which might exist.    Now, as for "pot odds," our calculations suggest you would want close to two to one on your money to consider calling an all-in *if you knew your opponents exact cards before getting the money in*.  But, practically speaking, I think it's virtually impossible to fold this hand to almost any bet.  No matter what, you're going to be getting something better than even money, and rarely know someone well enough to tell a shove with a flush from a shove with a draw/semi-bluff.  Maybe only in the case where you bet out, and then the opponent shoves in a *huge* all-in overbet to take a tiny pot, and you know he's a craven coward, would you maybe consider getting away from your hand.  Let's say the pot's 400 preflop, you bet out 300, and he shoves all-in for 15,000... then you've got something to think about.|`|AA10726404	You can never know the exact two cards your opponents has for certain.    Those poker calculators rely on you supplying that information, but in a real game, you could not know for certain that the other guy was playing AQ against your KK.    But in any case it sounds like you are miscalculating your outs.  In a match up of the two hands mentioned KK does not need any outs to improve.  He just needs for there to be no ace, and no combination that would produce a superior hand, such as trip queens, a straight or a flush or better.    So your outs are really fairly irrelevant if you have the kings.  You are just hoping the other guy misses his outs.    UPDATE:    Sorry, I overlooked your specific board in the example.    According to the odds at Card Player they also agree it is 34.4%.    I guess on the turn your outs would be three sevens, three deuces, or one king.  That would be seven outs.  Or around 28% to hit.    If you miss your out on the turn, you pick up three more outs, unless it is an A or a Q (which are still outs for you, but just less helpful because it would give you only two extra outs on the river).  So let's say it comes a six.  You now still have the seven outs, plus three more outs.  So you now have ten outs or 20% to hit.    I'm guessing that the possibility of picking up those extra outs on the turn is what boosts the overall percentage to 34.4%.|`|HPuiI7BCaa	You've made a slight error. The KhKd needs the board to pair in order to win. Assuming that you're going to the river you have 7 outs on the flop for approximately 28%. But the turn card could pair on the river which gives you an additional 6%. [All numbers are rough estimates, but they are close enough for our purpose.) 28%+6% gets you to 34%.     Whichever card hits the turn there is about a 6% chance it will pair itself on the river.

rREPH4ENaa	yes you can do that and the easiest way is in lone wolves  - GOOD LUCK|`|CyGyZDNsaa	Yes you can, try doing lone wolves until you get your highest skill up to 30.

You can also get 200 exp or above and then get a 30 skill level and you will become a major. Like the other answerer, lone wolves is the easiest to level up in.

xeGrFMedaa	First of all, it's possible to beat the Sensei without the cards (I beat the Sensei without the cards but after, I bought the cards because i wanted to win against other Ninjas). To beat the Sensei, you have to go against him for at least 5 times. Note that the first few times of fighting the Sensei will be like fighting a computer so keep fighting him and eventually, he will start to weaken. When he weakens, it will be like fighting a normal penguin in Competition Mode and you will soon win the Sensei. You will be awarded with a Ninja Mask and it will allow you to enter the Ninja Hideout. If you still want those cards, you can get them in real life. They sell the cards at Norther American Toys "R" Us stores, the Club Penguin Online Store, toysrus.com and toysrus.ca. Once you get them, log onto the penguin that you want the cards to unlock to, click on Unlock Items Online and click on I have a code. Then, enter the code that is on the back on some of your card(s). Click DONE and you have unlocked your cards!    Hope that my long summary helps you.|`|YwQkCMuSaa	I'm sure you get power cards from buying items from the club penguin store but I'm not completely sure.|`|HxWaQdDLaa	You have to go to local toy shops and buy trading cards.

AA11901279	Here is my answer:Rule 3 - Password Scamming  Asking/trying to persuade another player to give you their password for any reason is against the rules and will not be tolerated.      Related Questions  Below are some related questions which may help you to further understand and follow this rule.      Why do we have this rule?    This rule is in place to protect our players' accounts. Even if you genuinely only wanted to 'borrow' their account we obviously can't tell the difference between this and a malicious person stealing accounts. So asking other players for their password will be treated VERY seriously.    What if I try to get someone else's password but don't succeed? Have I still broken the rule?    Yes, you have still broken the rule - even if you aren't successful this will almost certainly result in a permanent ban being placed on your account. You shouldn't even be trying to get someone else's password!    What if I ask in a different language?    The rules apply equally to all languages, therefore you will still be breaking the game rules.    I have submitted a Password Request because I have forgotten my password. Why has it not been actioned yet?    You must submit sufficient accurate information to Customer Support in order for us to issue you with your password again. If we feel the information that you have supplied is not adequate for us to consider you the original owner of the account, then we will not give you control of that account.    Please do not send in multiple password requests with inaccurate information to Customer Support, unless you want to present new additional and highly compelling evidence that you are the owner. If you do so this may be deemed a misuse of Customer Support, which may then be withdrawn from your account.    Someone has asked me for my bank PIN. Is it all right if I tell them?    Asking for someone's bank PIN is just as serious as asking for an account password. It allows other players access to your account. Under no circumstances should you tell another player your password, PIN number or any other personal details of your account.    To keep RuneScape enjoyable for everyone please observe and follow this rule. We will not tolerate disruptive players, and if you break our rules your account is likely to be banned. Members who are banned for breaking our rules are not entitled to any sort of refund.|`|526b5d682d2754d76673bbb30e073b58aa	sorry i oly have level 10|`|AA11862293	im sorry. no one on yahoo! answers ever gives an account higher than level 10|`|b1c94548040d55655d749518aecf5e3faa	you are a nerd go get a girl friend and get away from ur computer|`|813e3e1e08ccea80a1ce496bd81fbe6baa	You don't NEED one, you only WANT one.

74fd3a2fe03049cc690c2fa595bd32c8aa	In those online games, it's very time consuming to earn enough gold (game currency) to buy something valueable (rare items in game). People who are too busy can't spend much time in game to earn more golds, but they still want good items. So they're willing to spend money in real life to buy in game golds.    "Farmers" are dedicated gamers who spend most of their time (20/24 hours a day) to earn golds, they are skilled players and have a lot knowledges, tricks to get as much gold as possible. After that they sell the in game gold to get real life money.    Most of these people come from developing countries like China, as the real life money they earn is a lot to them (paying in USD), so they consider "farming gold" their serious job and work very hard for that.

AA11647021	Forget about the hype, get the Beretta, Ive had both, for me the Beretta's have such perfect action, and also you cannot reload a shell casing after fired in the glock, due to the fact that the glock barrel does not fully surround the brass,      So when fired the brass being unsupported bulges, damaging it so that it may never again be reloaded, and as you get into shooting sports you will see the fun and huge savings involved with hand loading your own ammo!    and don't get a pussy 9mm,(more hype) go to the 40 caliber or the 45acp, or you ll do what we all have done, sell the 9mm and then go to the big boy!
AA11619588	yes that's exactly why it slows down like that... the world is a lot bigger in san andreas than in the previous games and alot more interaction is available.... hence alot more data processing is required... so, when you interact with a whole bunch of things, like when the cops are chasing you or your'e shooting a bunch of stuff with lots of explosions it is a lot more to process for the computer... it's just like in contra or guirius for the nintendo in the later levels if you just kept running and didn't shoot any thing the video game would actually freeze up cause it was to much information for the computer inside to process at one time.|`|AA12036288	Normal the game also freezes if you put in a lot of cheats.|`|09b4b0dae5984a5cd67183340904298aaa	Try turning your graphics down low. or reinstalling the game might help|`|b3c21a0d061132f52c1a5754d77e5699aa	I think this is normal.

AA12340086	Good game for what you are asking for is 'Mercenaries' for PS2.    The game is free roaming.  The setting is in Korea and the regime there (North Korea-General Song) has nuclear arms (go figure).  America, China, the Russian Maffia (there as a buisiness opportunity) and South Korea are the different factions in the game.    The rest of the world declared war on North Korea and reminants of General Song's army and his top men are still lingering.    You are a mercenary. You work for some kind of mercenary company.  You are there to collect the bounties put on the "Deck of 52".  52 top men from General Song's regime.    You do missions for the heads of the different factions and depending on what your doing and who your killing, that faction's mood toward you will change-either they will like you and offer you missions/money or they will shoot at site if they hate you.      You can pick up and use any weapon on the ground, drive/use any vehical around (faction vehicals/armor, civilian cars, enemy (north korea) vehicals).    You end up being able to purchase things from the maffia - air strikes, artillary barrages, vehical drops and supplies.  You throw a smoke grenade and a chopper will come and drop the stuff!  Really cool.    Best part is.......any and every building in the game can be destroyed (imploded).  You have C4 and the air/artillary does the job as well.    The gameplay is a little lacking but it just takes getting used to.  The physics in the game are really good, you throw a grenade underneath a North Korean jeep and it goes flying and will do real damage if it hits you.    While your doing missions for each faction (usually against another faction) your 'company' will message you advising of some new info they received on where one of the deck of 52 people are.  You get alot of money if you kill them (then you have to take a picture) or more money if you knock'em out and take them alive.  You then signal for a pick up buy throwing a smoke grenade and a chopper comes and lands.  You pick up the guy and load him into the chopper.

p1N1hB2Qaa	It depends alot on what you really want.  Which console has better games for you?   Xbox for me, PS3 doesn't have anything I want yet, and I'm looking for an excuse to buy one.  The 360 has better FPSs(Gears of War 1, Gears of War 2, Halo) so far, the multiplatiform games like COD4,DMC4,...etc look the same on both systems to me, so there's no reason to pay an extra $100 bucks.  XBoxes online service is so much better, but then again its not free.  The PS3 has a blu ray if you're into that, personally I don't feel like paying 30-40 bucks for a movie, but to each his own.  There is the red ring problem but xbox has extended their warranty to cover it for 2-3 years(not sure here).  If it does happen, they will send you free stuff(headset, games, accessories, or xbox live subscription) to make up for it and they pay for all shipping.  The cause of the problem was from overheating, which isn't being reported in the newer generation of xboxes.  Either way, good luck, let us know what you decide.|`|IQZNkeNzaa	This guy above me is crazy PS3 is way better than Xbox 360.  Xbox 360's always break, PS3's never break. Xbox 360 did have better games when PS3 first came out because the 360 was already out for a year but now PS3 games are becoming so much better.  <br>  <br>  Online is free, downloading demos is free and so much more.  Plus you have to buy add on to get the dvd hd player which they don't even make those movies anymore.  With PS3 it comes with a free blue ray player and they cost about 400 to 500 dollars if you bought a blue ray player separately. <br>  <br>  I still don't get why people buy systems that are built worse than a glass house.|`|mvu0yrF8aa	hard decision.... i'd say xbox 360|`|bblyrROxaa	xbox 360 because you can chat with your friends on xbox live and it has better games like halo and it's over $100 cheaper!!! trust me i have a PS3 but i wish i had a xbox 360|`|VanFbcZDaa	Playstation3.|`|vzrIEdRqaa	PS3

heV4IoBzaa	i realy loved 4 and 3 not bad and 2 is good 5 is having some errors and also i liked it.<br>  my answer is:<br>  1-call of duty 4<br>  2-call of duty 2 <br>  3-call of duty 5<br>  4-call of duty 3 <br>  srry i can't judge for 1 i didn't play it and for call of duty red army it like 2<br>  (heart breakers and life takers) XD from cod 4|`|wPBfydYhaa	For me, call of duty untied offensive(expansion pack for cod1) was by far the greatest in the series for multiplayer. It was the first to have vehicles and also had the greatest game-type of any cod game, Base assault.its 3 bases both sides, u had to destroy em with tanks or explosives so the whole team were forced to work together,tanks were brilliantly implemented into the game, powerful but not invincible ,battles got really intense and you really required some cooperation and strategic thinking if you wanted to win.something ive notice lacking in newer titles, i see in cod4 everyone lonewolfs it and try to take out as many as they can to call in airstrike and call choppers, also the constant shifting of fronts i found very annoying as there is no one place to focus on to set up ambushes or stuff like that.|`|fCFgF96Uaa	Call of Duty 2 was better than 3.<br>  However, Cod4 is the top and will always be.|`|8yyDm0Qsaa	I've played 1,3,4,5, and I'd say five is coolest, 3 is great story, and 4 is awesome online. 2 looks pretty beast I'm thinking about buying it to complete my CoD collection|`|bblyrROxaa	CoD 4 is best all my friends tell me, but i haven't played it yet.|`|mvu0yrF8aa	idk i like 3 for online, and i dont have a 360 or ps3. but i havent tried cod world at war yet|`|AQgag0d4aa	i have a 360 and i have the modern welfare (call of duty 4) the best game i've so far..i like the online features and the gameplay will addict u to it..try it ur gonna like it ohh and the story line is insane,you want more n more and after it ends u get bummed out..|`|0J2RLkBFaa	Call of Duty 4 is always fun so up to date ww2 games get a little old but 5 made it fun again.

Gears 2 is great online as well but you need to be in a certain mood for that.<br>  And if you just want some fun I'd say Banjo-Kazooie Nuts and Bolts|`|lmKwo7Kjaa	Fallout 3,it never gets old. who knows what you'll find in that game =D|`|GK9vIgK7aa	oblivion<br>  <br>  and halo 3 for multiplayer|`|gcdwMghwaa	Fallout is a piece of trash, Gears of war is probably the best in my opinion

101408e301d215ca0104288dc13c3614aa	Ok, I was a pro at this in silver (same thing)    it is actually pretty simple, take any pokemon you want to duplicate at once (up to five per cloning) and save!  If you don't save now you could really regret it- I lost my lvl 100 feraligatr because I didn't save!  anyway, after saving deposit those five (or less) and only those five, and dont withdraw anything.now say change box, and when it just sayiing "saving... don't" shut the power off.  Unfortunately g/s/c are the only games it works on.      I think this works because it saves the pc contents before the party contents, because if you do it right, you will have every pokemon you tryed to clone in both your pc and party (unless you do it wrong like my feraligatr, it shouldn't glitch your game)|`|a1ec5bf456ee88afda76017dfc39fe4eaa	go here - http://cheatcc.com/gb/pokemongs.html|`|8918d594ed32ca879c7a663a05a8e1e7aa	Clone you say?

Manly beacuse you may clone a pokemon but you may also delet the file. (and the risk of loseing the game all togelther!)|`|AA12267933	switch to an empty box then Put a pokemon in that empty box and then switch boxes to another box then when it says "saving do not turn the power off" turn it off before the message is complete then turn it back on and the pokemon in the box should be in the box and your party   P.S. save first but beware because this may delete your saved file

7ViNk0fOaa	This is a really difficult game to come into with a set strategy, because so much depends on the cards you get at the beginning and on what actions  the other players are taking.  Especially for a first go around.     I would concentrate on just having your family survive with out having to beg in your first game.  Once you do that, try to avoid losing points by having one of everything.  Familiarize yourself with the actions and cards that are available EVERY game, then in subsequent games you can concentrate on exploiting the combinations available to you with your specific hand of cards.|`|502b8fc880a1aac97ee1bcf5b79fd9e4aa	It's more of a tactical game than one of strategy because a) the cards you receive at the start of the game are different with every play and b) you'll need to pay attention to the actions selected by the other players.     The risk of too many family members is acquiring enough food to feed everyone.|`|9YYwoHYZaa	Get more family members as soon as possible because you get an action for every family member in each turn.

There is enough to do there for a day or day. They must see Expedition Everest, the newest coaster. They will be amazed by what it looks like. They must ride the Wildlife Express Train which goes around the park and you see different animals. It is absolutely amazing.    Epcot Center is okay, but I'm not sure if there is much to do there for them. Maybe I'm wrong.    Disney's Hollywood Studios will excite them. The different stunts and things to do is amazing. You can ride some of your favorite films. You can see back lots of famous movies and much much more. Two day stop for that one.    Magic Kingdom will be a two day event as well. You must see the fireworks there. There are many rides for them there. A train ride and a viewing of the castle. The choices are endless.    There is much to do at Disney World. So much to see. I suggest that you spend a week there. Believe, my cousins have been there for long periods of time. It is amazing. Ten days could be spent there to see everything if that is even possible.|`|LiTMU2Dhaa	Fantasyland in the Magic Kingdom is a must-do for kids of that age group.  A lot of the stuff in Animal Kingdom should be fun for them also.  As for the travel tips, if you have a car with a TV, favorite DVDs are a must.  Try planning some side trips also so they can get out and stretch their legs.  Also when i was little, my parents would get us a sheet of paper or a book and some stickers.  Every hour we put a sticker on the paper.  I know it doesn't sound like fun but for me and my siblings it was kind of exciting to see we were getting closer.  If it's possible travel late so they can sleep as much as possible  Have Fun!|`|AJxI2erWaa	Definitely go to Epcot center, it is a great place to experience different foods of the world and it is great for children.

AA10550142	The machine comes with all the cables you'll need, no games, and one controller with a headset.  The premium system comes with an installed hard drive, which is the best thing ever on a gaming console.    What you should get:    A second wireless controller!  Some rechargeable AA batteries and a charger OR the rechargeable battery pack for the controllers.  Headphones (if you want to play online, the headphones that come with the XBOX 360 are really bad)  A cooling fan.  (the 360 can overheat- most game stores sell fans that attach to the console to help prevent this)  Some games, I think.  GEARS OF WAR is awesome (graphic!) for adults and older teens.  Dead Rising is a lot of fun as well.  Oblivion is a RPG game that is very very addictive.  Ask the game store about titles for kids.  You can also rent games at Blockbuster.    Half the fun of the XBOX360 is playing online.  This requires HS internet and an XBOX live account.

I never felt comfortable ordering off of ebay, so maybe you could try Best Buy or ebgames.com if you are strictly looking online.  There might also be a local Blockbuster or other suitable video rental place that sells used and new copies of games!

Then approach it when you're pointer looks like a speech bubble that is not the color grey you can right click the npc. He will tell you about the quest and then at the bottom right of your screen click accept quest. Sometimes npc's offer multiple quests and you can choose both. just do what I said twice. If the exclamation point is grey this means that the quest is a high level one and just return in a few levels.

b6f230f54f67b22cbe07843096af3e2aaa	I loved both Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II for the Playstation2.  You would have never thought that a crossover between Square and Disney would work so well, but it does.  You play the part of Sora, trying to destroy the heartless who are taking over the worlds of both Square and Disney.  You pretty much reenact many of Disney's popular movies, except with the heartless incontrol of the bad guys!    The gameplay is action-based, so it never gets boring.  Although, I found in Kingdom Hearts II, there was a lot more story, so the action got interrupted a lot.      I found that KH and KHII, even though based on Disney, is no kids game.  The plots were rich, deep and intense, probably too intense for a Disney audience, while the look and feel of the game probably was not ideal for Square's audience either.  I am glad despite this, it saw massive success!! Including in me!!    I hope you pick up copies of both games, and I heard the GBA game was fairly good too.|`|4320e273b6f5338e26c87fe527dba91eaa	i really like the game, cuz of  its story. i only like kh2.|`|282ff0defe58c0696689b9b8198d7aa4aa	Both games are great.

That way, they can get a lot of tech and you can buy the last food upgrade, which is fishing!  Then it's just a matter of placing your peeps in the water to teach them to fish.|`|aacd05d4cbde85c2b7d45473c598e888aa	well... you have to:  1. have level 3 in farming  2. clean the debrif  3. clean the lagoon  4. catch a magical fish in the lagoon (farmer have to be expert)  5. your villager then will be fishing by themself (those who have farming skill)    for gaining tech point:  1. put more than 3 people in the research table  (the one in the center of the village)  2. the more the expertise the more they gain tech points...    tips:  1. for the beginning (the easy level) put 3-4 people in research, 1 people in building, 1-2 in farming.  2. try to improve the farming level first cause the berry will soon run out...  3. don't ever try to have baby when you still have 400 food  4. try to make school, cause it is help especially when you get the golden child (he is very annoying!!! although do usefull things also)    have fun...

FTRs5w3eaa	The best way to get an honest answer is to go onto the Disneyland website and look for the guest relations phone number. You could discuss it with them.    Im sure they have professional photographers available, but Im not sure on the prices.|`|AA10214265	I believe the wedding pictures you have seen are from Disney World. Disneyland does not allow weddings in its park during operating hours (apart from the Japanese for some reason).    Some people have their guests & photographer buy admission and then do a commando photo in front of the castle. The park frowns on staging group photos unless they are consulted, and that's why there are so few wedding photos of Disneyland.    The other answerer mentioned the shopping pass where you leave an imprint of a credit card and come back in a hour. That policy has been discontinued. Everyone who enters the park must buy an admission ticket.|`|bc6be8cf9fa84942fee4ebbf6f88f4d6aa	blah blah blah   i can tell that u r a dumb blond|`|CCUGKYi5aa	The pics taken at the castle on the Disney Weddings website were all people who had weddings there in front of the castle. You might be able to get them to take pictures for you but you would have to pay admission to get into the park and then pay the photographer. Even when you have a wedding in the park, the guests have to pay an entrance fee into the park (lame huh?). But that's a big maybe. More than likely no wedding no pictures.     Rumor has it (and by rumor I mean my friend did this once but I'm not sure if there were special circumstances) that if you leave a credit card at the ticket booths you can go into the park for one hour for the purpose of shopping, without being charged but if you're not back in an hour they'll charge the credit card the price of admission. So theoretically you could get a professional photographer of your own, get everyone into the park for one hour and get out with only paying for the cost of the photographer. But it's risky cuz if you don't get out in time that's a lot of money.     In the end though, it will probably cost a lot to get that picture. Best to use the money on something else.
fPavekfeaa	No, unless the text on a card specifically references other zones such as your library or the graveyard it only has an effect on the in play zone. Only creatures in the in play zone would be put on the bottom of the library in this case.

They can be comboed well with gravity bind and such.  e.g. Swarm of Scarabs is face down. during my main phase i flip summon it to kill something and then i flip it face down again.    hope this helps|`|yzpU5fZJaa	thats not true, with the scarab card, if it is special summoned, you can use it's effect, but if it is normal summoned, you can't. if it is set, then the next turn you can flip it, and then set it again.

c648a9388b1a88dfae79131156aa6523aa	1) Yes, an opponent may build his settlement to break up ' ' player's line of roads.  However, that opponent still must obey the distance rule (each city or settlement must be at least 2 spaces away from all other settlements and cities, including his own), so the only way to break up that road in your example is to build it 2 roads from the right like so....    ^ = your opponent's settlement    - -   - -   - - ^ - -      2) You can NOT build through an opponent's settlement nor city.  So for example, given what's below you would NOT be able to build a road past the '^'    - -   - -   - - ^     However, if you already had your own road built past your opponent's settlement like below, then you would be able to continue on.  It's just that you would have a more difficult time regaining/holding on to Longest Road since you can only add to your LR requirement from one side at a time and not by building roads from either end.    - -   - -   - - ^ -|`|jvuW18wvaa	Actually, the rules Do address the first part of your Q directly, under the "Longest Road" explanation, with illustration example:    - White Player builds a road from Point A to Point B, with a total of 7 pieces (A.1 - A.7), one settlement at A.1 and one settlement at A.6  - Black Player's road intersects, But Does Not Cross this road at Point A.3 (aka Point C).  Black Player then places a (legal) settlement at Point C. White Player's road is now broken.    The rules also directly address the second half of your Q under the FAQ section, with illustration example:  Q: Can I build a road behind an opponent's settlement?  a. No.The rules state that a player may only build a road adjacent to his or her own road, settlement or city.  b. In the illustration, the white player may build a road adjacent to his/her settlement.  c. The black player may not build a road behind the white settlement.    So - yes, the settlement acts as a "block" from further expansion.    * Settlers of Catan  http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1...  "In Settlers of Catan, players try to be the dominant force on the island of Catan by building settlements, cities, and roads. On each turn dice are rolled to determine what resources the island produces. Players collect these resources to build up their civilizations to get to 10 victory points and win the game. Multi-award-winning and one of the most popular games in recent history due to its amazing ability to appeal to non-gamers and gamers alike."    Hope this helps - Have Fun!|`|6n9E80WPaa	yes you can break a road with a settlement. No you can't build a road through a settlement.

X9kNbpnQaa	This does indeed mean that you do everything on the card. So you would deal 2 damage and then draw a card. You would draw after you dealt the damage.    Unfortunately, my fellow answerer is incorrect. If someone kills your target in response (such as using their own Electrolyze to kill it in response) you would not get to draw a card because you lost all your targets.    "The spell or ability is countered if all its targets, for every instance of the word target, are now illegal." ---Rule 413.2a This actually means that the card counters itself it it doesn't have any legal targets.|`|fPavekfeaa	Yes that is how electrolyze works. In this case even if your opponent somehow makes the creature an invalid target, say by giving it protection, or by somehow removing it from play the second line still resolves allowing you to draw a card.    However if the card read as one complete line:    Deal 2 damage to target creature and then draw a card.    In this case since the draw a card text is on the same line as dealing damage to a target if your opponent made his creature an invalid target then you would not draw a card because the ability on the line was countered by the target being invalid.    All cards that have multiple lines work this way. If there is no cost listed before the line then you do what it says on the line.    A cost is always denoted by some text or a symbol then a : then some  text describing the ability.  Everything before the : is the cost to use the ability, everything after tells you what you can do once that cost is paid.
gOCpCVhLaa	Well, you can go about it a few ways. You can go all out and just burn the whole time or focus on creature controll with a bit of burn. Some of the people who use brun decks around here use a lot of swarm of scarabs because its constent effect of destroying a monster. most of the monsters that flip face down are good for burn decks. On the other hand them monsters are also weak so I would not count on attacking much so it might help to put in toll as well. I was using Chain energy + Gravity bind + Swarm of scarab's + Lava golem with Golem sentry's. Chain energy and toll will take care of the life just as long as you make sure you put down all the cards you need to survive. the Lava golem, golem sentry, and swarms will take care of the creatures.But it seems like you have a good fire burn deck going on. I would lock down the field with gravity bind, The dark door ,stumbling , wall of revealing light , level limit area B, and consider Dark Room of Nightmare,and Wave motion cannon.  Hope that helps!! good luck!!!|`|mHWsuqjZaa	If you win tournaments with that deck then i want to go to your tournaments. I would completely own everyone there. seriously this deck isn't ****.

AA11615216	Its probably going to be insane this weekend.  When the super bowl was here last time, we went the weekend prior (it was a ghost town) but the weekend of our neighbors went and said the parking lot was overflow, ride lines were 120 mins.  Just craziness. I'd stay away from Tampa right now, I live here and its no fun.  You probably could got the next weekend and be fine, or even later on.|`|83vhCGW1aa	Well, what I would do is go on Sunday.  Nobody is going to risk missing the superbowl because of a traffic jam on the way out of a theme park parking lot, and most fans will show up for the game very early just in case.  Afterwards, their team either won or lost, so they'll probably either partying or not be in the mood for much fun.  Either way, the Super Bowl crowd probably stays out of the amusement park all day Sunday.  If you happen to fall in love with Tampa while you're there and want to buy a home there, check out Taylor Morrison.  They sell homes in the area, and have a free $25,000 sweepstakes on their site. http://is.gd/eDHX
