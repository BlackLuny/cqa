IRFaBtr4aa	Yes you can,  All you have to do is upgrade your 1st gen to 2.0  and then you can go to iTunes store and you can download all the free applications unless you are willing to spend money.  You can "Jail-break" your iPod touch. Which means that you can hack your own iPod to get free apps. I do not encourage this because this is illegal... Although many people do it.      Good Luck!!!|`|uXj7thmnaa	yes, when you upgrade your first gen to 2.0 you will get the app store where you can download all those games and other apps.    however, on the ipod touch there is a fee to upgrade, $10 i believe.|`|ScwEtlNQaa	The first generation iPod touch does not have the 2.0 software, which the iPod will need in order to read the Apps. It can play Apps if you download it. You do need to get the Apps from the Itunes store as no Apps come with the iPod touch, rather than Safari, Weather, Youtube ect.
4fWZL4TRaa	Your actual load is 100W...  With no losses the current is 100W/12V = 8.33A  This means you need 8.33Ah capacity for each hour of running, with provisos as below.    WIth a 7Ah battery that implies 8.33A/7Ah = 0.84 hours  The nominal voltage of a 12V battery is 12.6V, but you will be lucky to have 12V at the inverter terminals.    Battery ratings..  The battery will be rated at the 10 or even 20 hour rate, so that is a current of 0.7A or 0.35A for a 7Ah battery. The current you are drawing is 10 times that, in reality too much for this battery. The battery capacity is derated considerably, so the implied 100W running time of 50 minutes becomes maybe less than half an hour.    In practice the losses due to the inverter must be added as part of the load. As this is a low load for an 800W inverter it would just be a stab in the dark to say what its losses are, unless you can measure the actual current drawn from the battery when running under that load. My feeling anything from a few watts to 150W losses. It could more than double the load. You could be down to 10 minutes if the battery doesn't get overheated. Batteries are also less capable in cold conditions. A 7Ah battery is more suitable for loads about 10W.    Get the drift? You need a larger battery. The load is more consistent with an 80Ah size deep cycle battery. This would run more like expected, up to 9h, perhaps somewhat less due to inverter losses.    If you want to run the Laptop only, it makes more sense to use an external battery pack that plugs in more directly. This will be more efficient at least. Most laptops run from an 18V battery. Look into the solutions for converting 12V to 18V (Laptop car adaptors), that will run on your battery as well. A solution that might be available, or soon will be, is a fuel cell for laptops. See the link. We are talking about something like 200ml of Methanol for 20h for a notebook. Sounds attractive.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	I have no idea. good luck        http://www.toboc.com/forum3/DEFAULT.ASPX...

Or you can get a good pair of headphones|`|9E502jsuaa	SOUNDPROOFING WALLS/CEILINGS USING RESILIENT CHANNEL AND ACOUSTICAL MAT TO MAKE A SOUND DEADENING WALL.   PRINTER FRIENDLY VERSION    The partition walls in most family homes are constructed of Drywall (Sheetrock/Gypsum Board) firmly attached to both sides of a wood or metal stud frame. When sound waves hit one side of the wall it causes the drywall on that side to vibrate. Since the drywall is rigidly connected to the stud frame, the vibration is transmitted right through the studwork to the drywall on the other side and re-radiated. Those same vibrations traveling through the studwork can also duct noise throughout adjacent floors and ceilings. Noise will radiate easily through the structure because theres almost nothing there to isolate or absorb the sound waves.   To reduce this effect and to dampen the sound waves, resilient metal channels can be inserted between one of the drywall walls and the studwork. The resilient channels act as shock absorbers, greatly reducing vibrations coming from either side of the wall from passing through the wall. Absorbent mat is used inside the wall to cushion the channel/drywall and to provide an absorbent compartment to trap sound waves.     The resilient channel technique by itself typically adds 3 to 5 (or more) Sound Transmission Class (STC) points to an otherwise identical wall or ceiling. This by itself, is not usually sufficient to meet total noise level reduction requirements under most circumstances. Other added construction materials and techniques are usually needed, such as adding absorbent mat and/or barrier material to the wall space. Some considerations are the amount of wall space that can be donated as mounting the wallboard on these 1/2" thick channels increases the thickness of the wall (or ceiling) somewhat.     It is important to distinguish acoustically effective resilient channels from hat channels, Z-channels and other lightweight metal furring systems that drywall contractors are used to installing. These other systems may resemble resilient channels, but they allow no movement and are simply too rigid to be effective. Only true resilient channels have any acoustical benefit.     It is extremely important to install these channels correctly. Improper installation will nullify any advantage gained from using it in the first place.     There are a few simple procedures that need to be followed when using them. In existing walls, large opening should be cut in the drywall panels to Open Up the wall and expose the dead air to the new wall covering. One large dead air space that is created and linked together contributes greatly to the sound control system. In fact, adding furring strips (spacing blocks) of 1"-2" increases the sound reduction effect (especially at low frequencies of sound) by increasing the dead airspace. The channels are then applied directly over Super Soundproofing MLV barrier mat that should be first used to cover the wall. The new drywall panels are then coated with absorbent closed cell matting material to create an absorbent compartment to dampen sound waves. The absorbent mat is applied like wallpaper using contact cement and a roller. The thickness of material used depends on the level of sound control desired: More is better! In an open, studded wall, sound barrier material (MLV) is typically stapled to the studs, but for best results, between a layer of soundboard and drywall attached to the channels, even though it can be cut and weaved between the studding. On walls and ceilings, the channel should be mounted at a right angle to the framing. On walls, mount with the narrow flange along the bottom and the larger flange up. This allows the drywalls weight to draw itself away from the framing. Make sure all the flanges should are pointing in the same direction.     When fastening the drywall to the channels, the mounting screws are to be driven into the channels in-between the studs or joists. It is absolutely critical not to "short out" the resilient channels by screwing long screws into the studs behind them. This rigid connection would destroy their benefit of Floating the wall or ceiling assembly.     The resilient channels should be held back from intersecting surfaces about ?" on the side edges, and about 4-6" from the top and bottom of the wall.    It does little good to carefully attach the channels in the middle of the wall if one installs baseboard screws that may connect the entire bottom edge to sill plates. Similarly, it is easy to "short out" the resilient channels at the top of the wall by screwing into headers. Leave space where the wallboard is not connected. The drywall attached to the channels also needs to be held back about ?" from similar intersecting corners. If the drywall panel edges are jammed against wall or ceiling panels, then they will tend to be rendered ineffective. For walls, the drywall edges should be resting on neoprene vibration pads and sealed with caulk before the wall is finish|`|kHwjvZKgaa	You can get some 8lb rock wool wrap it in cloth and place it along your wall.

Once you have your hdd, go to the system tab, then memory, chose the mem card, and gamer profiles, click your profile, then select move, then you will be able to move it to the hdd.  you can do the same to all your save games, as for DLC (themes, or expansions) you can download again for free if you arent allowed to move them.

The PlayStation 3 competes with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.    A major feature that distinguishes the PlayStation 3 from its predecessors is its unified online gaming service, the PlayStation Network, which contrasts with Sony's former policy of relying on game developers for online play. Other major features of the console include its robust multimedia capabilities, connectivity with the PlayStation Portable, and its use of a high-definition optical disc format, Blu-ray Disc, as its primary storage medium. The PS3 was also the first Blu-ray 2.0-compliant Blu-ray player on the market.    The PlayStation 3 was first released on November 11, 2006 in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 23, 2007 in Europe and Oceania. Two SKUs were available at launch: a basic model with a 20 GB hard drive (HDD), and a premium model with a 60 GB hard drive and several additional features (the 20 GB model was not released in Europe or Oceania). Since then, several revisions have been made to the console's available models.    Sony officially unveiled the PlayStation 3 to the public on May 16, 2005, during the E3 2005 conference. A functional version of the system was not present there, nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005, although demonstrations (such as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots) were held at both events on devkits and comparable PC hardware. Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown (e.g. Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire).    The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports; however, when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one HDMI port, one ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs. Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model, priced at $499 (499) and $599 (599), respectively. The 60 GB model would be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port, Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver. Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11 for Japan, and November 17 for North America and Europe.    On September 6, 2006, Sony announced that the PAL region (Europe and Oceania) PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, due to a shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray Disc drive.    At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22, 2006, Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system, but a chrome trim, flash card readers, silver logo, and Wi-Fi would not be included. Also, the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20%, and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan. During the event, Sony showed 27 playable PS3 titles running on final hardware.

Another option is to use a TivoHD with cable cards in place of the Verizon set top box. It will cost more per month (plus the cost of the Tivo) but it is so much better then the Verizon STB.     I am not sure why you need someone to hook up the xbox. It is not that hard to do and I am sure it even came with instructions to do it.
e67ffebdb5683980c42cc11d2dbd8402aa	It depends on how much longer your service agreement with alltel is.  If it's within it's last 4 months of service you can port your number to verizon from alltel without any etf(s).  Once it's ported over to verizon you'd be basically signing up for a new account so you would get any phone, including the storm, at 2yr pricing if you were willing to sign a 2yr agreement.  If you're not in the last 4 months of your agreement then you will probably have to wait a little bit until all alltel customers are merged into verizon... If you have any questions feel free to call customer service we're always happy to help:)|`|rxCwaaG4aa	Once your contract is up with Alltel you can port your number over to Verizon and get the Storm at a discounted price.

j5Apt8hWaa	The Nikon N80 camera is a rather advanced 35 mm SLR.    You will have to explain what you mean by "drift" events.    Basically landscapes and architectural shots are best shot using wide angle lenses. Standard zooms like 18-55 mm or 24-70 mm will be used for over 80% of your images.  Telephoto lenses are used for shooting action and sports, wildlife and other subjects that are a long distance from you and your camera.    You can scan your best images to your computer using a scanner or have your film processor make high quality CD's of your images at the time they are developed and printed.    Adding your company watermark on the bottom of your images can be done in the post processing of your scanned image files.    The N80 is no different than any other camera as far as controlling exposure except that the N80 can use all the current Nikon lenses (59 at present) and many good used Nikon lenses.    Magazines usually do not cover the technical aspects of using a camera.  That is usually left to the instructors of the first two classes in photography.

Best Buy sells  a Canon video camera for around $3500 that (from what I've seen) produces very nice videos.  Sony also has some decent ones on their website for $1,800 - $6,000.  However, if your talking professional as in movies and commercials, Panasonic has professional video cameras costing as much as $60,000.  Some links are listed below, hope I helped!    p.s.

Some news producers still use Betacam, a product that has not been made since 2001. These are available on eBay for under $1000. Wedding producers generally gravitate to the lower end, and for them the long recording time of HDD is perfect, priced at about $500. Sports shooters generally shun Mpeg2 compression, so for them miniDV works best at about $1500. Movie makers generally rent their equipment, especially if they have outside financing. Event documentarians are moving to DVD for the ability to sell immediate copies duplicated in faster than real time, about $1000.  For some videographers, the use of multiple cameras is more important than having one real expensive camera.
K01NU24saa	There is many " touch " about Plasma and LCD , search for the pass answer ! NEC is Japan history Electronics giant , there made tv for the pass 40 year, however NEC is very good for Hi-Tech products, very good quality Display ( monitor ) from NEC. TV quality just so so, NEC use to manufactures Plasma panel , factory was sold to Pioneer 2004, and because of less demand for Plasma , Pioneer total close it drown after 2006, Pioneer  buy Plasma panel from Hitachi,and now from Matsushita Display. IF you like Plasma TV, go for only Pioneer ( high price ) or Panasonic , the only 2 company keen to continue Plasma TV. I don't think NEC is good in TV.|`|cowXmiP3aa	Ihad a Plasma which was very good but now I have an LCD because it is lighter, has a wider viewing angle 7 uses less electricity, NEC has been around for years and is an excellent make.
1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	use a higher ISO setting. the sensor becomes more sensitive to light and allows you to use a higher shutter speed. if you do use flash, stand at an angle to the glass so the flash dose'nt bounce back at the camera. a higher iso with all your interior lights on is the best bet. and do'nt forget to put the white balance to indoor setting.|`|kSyiUxYSaa	One very cheap idea is to buy a small tripod and use that to stabilize. I found one for a dollar and it works great. If you have a large aquarium just put the tripod on a chair and scoot it up there and use the timer function too, that way the camera/tripod setup has time to settle if the chair is soft or whatever.

AA11900069	I've played on stages where nothing more fancy than a piece of wooden coat-haner and gaffer-tape have been used to achieve this, but for the last ten years or so, I have been playing electro-acoustics...  You could either get yourself one of these, and a suprisingly-good one can be had for as little as 150pounds, or you could fit a pick-up to your acoustic - either yourself or your guitar-shop could wire in a good-quality unit, or you can use one which is essentially of a temporary nature, clamping into the sound-hole, removable, transferable to other guitars if you want.        Having a pick-up in the guitar helps avoid feedback, they usually have an equaliser on them to tailor the sound, allowing you to cut or boost the bass, mid-range and treble notes, and volume, 'prescence'  the 'colour'and warmth of the tone...  Very versatile!  They can also allow you to get some almost-electric tones out of your acoustic, if you want!  You also benefit from being able to stand, walk about to relax, and not have to worry about sitting bolt-upright, ridgid in front of the microphone.        Pick-ups.  From a cheap, user-friendly passive unit, to a more sophisticated, 'active' model, are definitely the way to go.  I am fitting them to three restorations I am doing.|`|PVgMArd9aa	GAK.CO.UK

vPYcoJ0yaa	It probably won't work properly, because, as you said, Nth America uses NTSC, and Australia uses PAL. Therefore our tv's are set up to run PAL, not NTSC, input.    A friend brought her Gamecube over from Canada a couple of years ago, and even though we got it to "work", it was only in black and white, and quite fuzzy.    You would also need to buy a new adaptor, because Nth America use 110 volts, and we use 240volts; plus the power points are a different shape as well.    Also, the games may be geographically protected, meaning games bought here in Australia won't work in a US machine, unless you pay to get it "chipped" and thus voiding any warranty.|`|AA11542500	It should.  The Wii doesn't play movies and that's where NTSC and PAL formats differ.  As far as I know, the games aren't written in different formats according to regions.  The only differences amongst the Wii's that I know of are language.

j5Apt8hWaa	Actually whomever said the 11-16 mm Tokina lens is "better" than the Nikon 12-24 mm has a different set of criteria for lenses than pros do.  My guess is they were impressed by the slightly wider angle the 11 mm gives over the 12 mm.    It is ALWAYS better to buy the OEM lens .. in this case the 12-24 mm  Nikon.    It is true that Tokina is the best producer of generic lenses and in fact make many of the lenses sold by Pentax for their DSLR camera's and that they make the excellent Hoya filters.    1) I bought the 12-24 mm lens for my first D100 and now use it on my D300.  2) What does Tokina say?  http://www.tokinalens.com/products/tokin...   3) This is perhaps the most important question.  NO.  As you leave the entry level cameras, while the upper level cameras do not need the AF-S lenses to auto-focus, they are really the Nikon version of the Canon USM lens.  They are ultra fast auto-focus, quiet, super accurate focusing. lenses.  Nikon has 25 such lenses and as time goes on, you will see more.  Those of us who use Nikon D300 and D3 camera's still find the AF-S lenses to be the lens of choice even though they can use any of the older used AF Nikon lenses.|`|nU5UqACUaa	Both lenses are quiet different. The Nikon is hell an expensive and can not beat the Tokina 12-24 in picture quality. Both are F4.  Now, concerning the Tokina 11-16. It has 2 advantages. First it is a 2.8 all over, second it is absolutely the sharpest lens that has ever been produced. You can use it on a full frame camera in 15 to 16 mm only, below it's vignetting since it is made for apsc sensors.  If you can afford one, don't look elsewhere. None of the major brands is able to beat the sharpness and it's built like a tank.  One you used it, you just forget everything Nikon and others have   produced in the kind.    Note that it will not AF on the D40 but it has the fantastic Tokina clutch to manual focus which consists in the simple pull back of the front focusing ring and it frees the motor mechanism of the camera and you focus manually. Back to AF, push the focusing ring forward again and it hooks in.    Note also that Tokina is "the ancient" glass factory that Nikon sold once to stick to cameras and industrial and scientific products only and today, Hoya that produces Tokina lenses is the only glass factory for lenses in Japan. So what ever the brand of lens you buy, there is always a bit of "Tokina" in it anyway.    Concerning the remark that pros have different opinions then other is a well know fact. They pay also more for cameras that look better and can often less then consumer stuff. Pro means expensive and expensive is not absolutely a label of quality despite of the fact that pro DSLR's are pro-idiot proof and when you see how respect-less most pros take care of there material it is understandable.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	i agree with fotoace, the order is Nikonor, Sigma, Tamron, then, Tokina. if you're going to get an aftermarket lens then sigma is the best.

ip5EWw7uaa	Most adapted to the new technology. Much the same as the TV manufacturers shift from CRT to LCD screens today.    One feature of the new technologies is the level of outsourcing that occurs - manufacturers buying in what is needed. I should imagine much of the old technologies and the people who were carrying it out disappeared in the process.
CKRfaRYvaa	You can absolutely do this.  Once you purchase the phone, just go to www.verizonwireless.com and have your girlfriend log into her account.  Once there, just follow the links to activate a new phone.  It will ask you to choose if you're using your own equipment, just choose yes.  It will also ask you to choose a reason for the change, it's easiest just to choose 'other.'  After you do this, just follow the instructions on the web site to program the phone.  You can switch your phone online as often as you like and there's no charge.  :)  Also, if you need help with the web site, Verizon customer service will walk you through it, also at no charge.  :)    The only potential problem (and it's not very likely) is this:  if the phone is on a lost/stolen or disconnect for non-pay list, then the phone cannot be activated.  If possible, see if the seller will give you the ESN before you pay for the phone.  Then just call Verizon at 800-922-0204 and ask them to make sure the ESN is ok for activation.  They won't charge you for this.
1d193a581f413c8f01296a8f36389636aa	Metro PCS uses CMDA network which is the same network as Verizon and Sprint PCS.  The majority of Verizon cell phones can be flash (changed in its software) to work with Metro PCS.  Just visit a nearby Metro PCS retailer to see if they can flash your cell phone.

I suggest maybe renting it first, just in case you are not sure. the only thing I do not like about it was the beginning when they are setting the scene of the game.

1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	yes, but most places have a 30 day return thing, and you need a receipt. if it's a little longer than limit time they might do it if you can convince them you did'nt use the camera. that's my guess. if the exchange item is more or less you'll either pay the extra or get store credit or change.

If you have some kind of A/V selector, you don't need anything else. But if you don't, then you will need some female to female component plugs as well (3-5).    NOTE that this box does not actually output in true HD. It down-converts the video to 480p. If you're wanting to create some Youtube videos, it will get the job done quite well.

vGxr9e59aa	Batteries that have been under heavy load will tend to "bounce back" a bit if the load is removed and they're allowed to "rest".  This is a well-known phenomenon with lead-acid storage batteries used for starting cars after leaving the headlights on accidentally.  Your camera was turned off, putting minimal load on the Duracells; probably the only current draw was by the real-time clock circuit and the power switch monitor circuit.  If the batteries were dead a week ago, they're probably as good as dead now -- they have enough charge to fool the charge meter, but not enough to operate the lens motors or the photoflash more than once or twice before being depleted.|`|sux1aIHEaa	THIS HAS TO GO ON UNSOLVED MYSTERIES...haha  maybe it was your camera that messed up|`|b7e5d16fdf01ca92417f762dc4d6df63aa	Maybe a rechargeable batteries. someone might have charge it.

However the Sidekick must have a data plan for all the features to work. AT&T shouldn't have a problem with you using a phone from another carrier, but they may or may not be able to get all the data features to work.  The incompatibility of T-Mobile and AT&T 3G networks are not an issue because the Sidekick is not a 3G device. Although there will be a 3G Sidekick soon.

It started selling on October 7, 2003. It attempted to lure gamers away from the Game Boy Advance by including cellphone functionality. This was unsuccessful, partly because the buttons, designed for a phone, were not well-suited for gaming and when used as a phone the original N-Gage was described as resembling a "taco". In 2005, Nokia announced that it would move its N-Gage games capabilities onto a series of smartphones. These devices have been available since early 2007, and a pre-release version of the N-Gage application allowing users to purchase and download games was made available for download from the official N-Gage website on February 4, 2008. The full version of the N-Gage service was released to the public on April 3, 2008.|`|PGc4zq9haa	Is the volume on your Nokia N-Gage QD too soft? I can barely here mine
nU5UqACUaa	funny that some try to explain and do not know what's about and others know what's about but don't know how to explain.    In modern life, everything that is not digital is analog. Analog has indeed no real sense other then "not digital".  Digital cameras record pictures on a light sensitive capture device and translate the received information in electric currents that are digitized and  translated in computer language to reproduce a picture that is visible on computer screens. Same lcd screens take place in the camera.   During more then close to one century, the pictures where recorded on a film strip that was coated with multiple light sensitive layers of silver-dust. Every single layer was sensitive to another color and the mixture recorded the picture by projection of the lens on the film, then developed in chemicals, then projected on a special silver coated paper sheet that was developed in a chemical bath suite to get the final photo.  Today, there are 2 ways to see your shot, on screen and on paper by printing it to just any size you want. The only advantage to digital is the storage is simple and takes not much space compared to film rolls, you see the first result right away on the camera screen, you can see it on computer as often you want, it is cheep since you shoot as much  as you want and delete what is not good and a few more.    The disadvantage is picture quality never gets as good as film, not that good color dynamic all over, the Fuji S5 comes close to it in digital. Digital pictures just look digital. In low light objects look like painted with water color, often the edge of dark and clear look like cut or glued in the picture and a few more.    The biggest bargain of digital, every one or almost has one and makes pictures. The biggest disadvantage of digital, every one has one or almost and makes pictures.    So hope it helped you to answer your question.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	there's no such thing as an analog camera, it's a misnomer created by new photographers when they are refering to (35mm film cameras). and digital cameras use a light sensitive (sensor) to gather the light.|`|j5Apt8hWaa	empenage2003 is 100% correct!    For some reason, the uninformed and uneducated assumed that once a "digital' camera was produced, all others became analog.  This may be true for telvision signal transmissions, cell phones and even high end home stereo equipment, but it does not apply to cameras. Using the word "analog" to describe cameras that use film shows the persons ignorance and less than amateur approach to photography.  Advanced amateurs know the difference ...    In fact all the light that is focused at the film plane, whether detected by film or a sensor, is analog.  If film, then it is developed using chemicals and a darkroom or machine to print the negatives.  If a sensor, the image is converted from analog to digital using an analog to digital converter.  It is at this point that the image is processed based upon some settings the photographer has set in the camera and the resulting image becomes a JPEG file.  Only RAW files are processed outside the camera in some kind of "digital darkroom" like Photoshop.
V1O7N02saa	Probably only through an iPod touch app called TruPhone. Try that|`|9G7CZg4maa	Yes skype and all that may be good. BUT your ipod touch has no input source for audio. So you may be able to hear people but using a headset in the headphone jack will not input your voice to the ipod. So you will need to buy a microphone which connects into the port where you plug your computer into. (usually pretty expensive)|`|VRbaPhB5aa	Try getting Skype on your touch, you will need wi-fi connection, there is a program in aps store called fring that has skype already in it.|`|c8c505ff8f07af9e17782a8da376a7dcaa	Well skype but i recommend not b-c you need wifi to do it and an ear peice it will just be a big hassle but u can text and im (still need's internet connection)    search pinger phone on the app store
EWuVYSOXaa	You would be able to use the phone but be aware you will be required to have an iPhone data plan.  If you do not then within a 24-48 hr period of time you will be contacted and informed that you must have that plan or stop using the phone and lack of the plan could incur some pretty high data charges.

H9zYhBeRaa	Hi  The Original PSP is 33% Less lighter than the PSP slim and lite and also is 19% Less slim. But i don't know why this makes a difference because I like it as it first was, I liked it being a bit heavy. That's why im going to buy it off my friend because he doesn't like it compared to the PSP slim and lite and the PSP 3000.    It also is good to carry around in your pocket and holds music, videos and you can put MSN on it if you have a WI-FI connection. It saves you from having a music player and is also fun to play around at your parents place (seeing as they don't have like a PS3).     Also it has the best feature of being portable you don't need to sit in front of a massive screen all day and waking up in the morning with sore eyes.    Hope This Helps|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i HATE IT!! the 3000 is much more better|`|SjEHRf1Waa	I dont like it :D its fat,its heavy,its looks bad ,etc.    i mean 2000 or 3000 is better :P xD

It's a good deal.

I just bought a canon slr 8mp half price at 199, but I had to queue up outside Jessops at 7.30 on a Sunday morning, cause it was a promotion for a new store opening.|`|dWM4EceSaa	I would recommend the Panasonic Lumix (someone has a;ready mentioned it.) it's got more than enough megapixles 7.2 infact. really you don't need more that 5 megapixles as a 5 megapixle camera can do poster sized prints that are photo lab quality. trust me on that fact.  i have a Kyrocera S3r. its only a 3.2 megapixle camera but ive got a poster sized print from that and the quality is amazing. that camera is 3 years old and it can do it.   out of the 2 cameras you have mentioned, go for the Canon as they only specialise in photography where as sony dont.   the panasonic lumix i mentioned is currently on an advert on the tele. it has a graet zoom and a wide angle lense so you can fit views etc in your shot.   hope this helps. And remember, HAVE FUN !|`|rvhxU3t0aa	well samsung has a new camera out that is exactly what ur asking for, but i can remember the name of it.|`|yKettx3Haa	panasonic released one with 7.2 mp but it had 10x optical zoom!!!  keep in mind this is still a compact camera

I actually OWN a DSC-H5 and it totally blows the EasyShares out of the water. They're just not solid digital cameras. Sony's are a great price, and they take amazing pictures. The only thing I WOULD say is that it can be a little tough on batteries. I recommend getting some recharging batteries if you plan to use it often!

If you experience further problems, use the driver tool which can be downloaded from:    http://www.bvrpforums.com/drivertool/    The tool will clean out the previous installations of drivers and reinstall them.
CkW0lc8gaa	Most handsets will do the job these days. I would recommend getting a phone with a large screen. Also one with 3G or 3.5G otherwise, it will be painfully slow. Select a data plan from a telco preferably one with unlimited data access.    In terms of browser, use Opera Mini or Opera (if it is already on your phone). I know that the Motorola V6 Maxx, Nokia 6120 and 6500 has this already installed. All of these phones have 3.5G with the exception of 6500 which has 3G.    I use my phone to reads the news, check my email on Gmail, Yahoo and Hotmail.    If you require push mail, I recommend Morange. You can leave it running the background and it's very data efficient. It also supports chatting in GTalk, MSN and Yahoo Messenger.

You can try and see if someone has a somewhat high level (10+) toon on said realm with the name you're looking for on wowarmory.com but a lot of people "reserve" names they like on their realms and never intend to play them just because they can. Due to that, a lot of the more common names end up being taken.    If your name is unique though, I'd like to say that your chances of getting that name is fairly good.

But, I'm with you CAM GIRLS UNITED :)    Ok, seriously though, it's really easy to get started as a web cam girl.  On the sites I model on us girls can work whenever we choose and as much as we want.  There is no one to answer to and there are no minimum work hours.  Sometimes I go months without working on cam.  And when I need to earn some quick money I'll log on and stack some cash.  Here are the sign up links:  http://models.streamray.com/friend/Natas...  http://imlive.com/vippath.asp?host=y&hnu...

676XZjUYaa	Based on the potential solutions on the Nintendo page you have provided, you might need to access the router's actual settings to see if you have to manually add the Wii to your router's "allow" list, or to change the broadcast settings to "Mixed".    I also have an Orange Livebox, and although I haven't had problems connecting my consoles to it, I have had to play around with the settings in the past to get my computer to connect to it.    You'll need to access the router's settings through your computer, and although there is a specific way to call up your router's settings, I did it too long ago to remember exactly how (blush).    If you call Orange Broadband support on 0844 873 8586, they're not too bad, and will talk you through accessing your router's settings.    The Livebox is actually Xbox Live certified, so they may even be able to give you some help with your Wii connection issues if they're set up to deal with gaming questions.|`|80a495386ad239c553f784aba0e032a3aa	It could be that the Nintendo Wi-Fi connection is currenly down as this would give you this error. It may also be worth trying to set up your conection on a differnet connection number under the Nintendo Wi-Fi settings on your Wii as this can sometimes make a differnece. Another thing to check is the Wii systems clock is set to the right time as this could cause errors in decriping seurce connections.|`|nh0Vs91maa	Get a mate, shove his nose into it and say "do u understand?"

RCbtRF4xaa	I first saw this camera when a friend of mine was using it at Sturgis. His pictures, taken under all kinds of difficult conditions, turned out great. Before buying this Kodak 1285 I searched the internet, stores, and websites looking for any camera that may have been a better deal but could not find any! The combination of 5X Zoom (plus an additional 5X digital Zoom) was tops in it's class alone. But when you add the unprecidented 12MP nothing else came close unless you went to a SLR size camera. I already have a fantastic 35mm SLR camera but seldom have it with me because of the size. This camera will fit in a pocket or in a small belt pouch and I have had it with me nearly all of the time since I've purchased it. It also has the advantage of taking AA batteries rather than the rechargeable internal batteries. I use rechargeable AAs and have been using the first pair for a month now without having to replace them. And if I'm ever in a situation where my rechargeables are dead I can always use standard AA batteries which are available everywhere! This camera is easy to use, with several "smart" modes but is still able to be set up manually. It is versatile, easy to use, takes AWESOME pictures under most conditions and, best of all, it's affordable.     Walmart price $149.88  Amazon price $135.00 free shipping  reference: http://www.amazon.com/Kodak-EasyShare-12...|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	yeah, three crap reviews on the bestbuy site, alone..http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?... yourself a favor read this. it's got reviews and prices.  http://www.digitalcamerareview.com/digit...

In fact at the budget end they are often the clear choice.    Even Kodak have to compromise a little to keep the price down. It's very important to compare the reviews. I find dpreview.com to be a reliable and consistent place to find reviews, but they don't review every camera. Steve's Digicams reviews most models but they all tend to get quite positive reviews. You have to read between the lines to find the concerns.    Have a look at this review of the Kodak Z8612IS on dpreview and see how it compares to it's peers. Depending what you want the camera to do, it might be a better choice than the Z1285IS...    http://www.dpreview.com/reviews/Q408enth...|`|m5aenb6qaa	Kodak Camera is fine.But you can still go for the better brands like Canon and Sony. look for the optical zoom rather than the megapixel. i think 5X optical zoom is better.
yrYQHbYAaa	Have you tried pressing the sync button (small white circle) on the console and then pressing the xbox sync button on the controller. If you have a charge cable then try connecting it and see if it works, if it does then its not the controller its the wireless connection. Or you could check if a mates controller works on your xbox and your controller works on his if so you could swap.    I had a similar problem with a wireless ear piece not working with old controllers but mine was a year old. I ended up swapping mine with his as he had a wired mic which worked on my controller. Microsoft has a good help line which is free, might be worth giving them a call.|`|IALsvRn8aa	you need to press the button on the xbox by the power button it is the diameter of a pencil eraser then press the same thing on you controller it is between the rt and lt triggers see if that did it|`|ppKQEhEMaa	Charge it/ Replace batteries
w4I9oj2Maa	The ringing noise comes from the COILS in your Horizontal circuit vibrating, then that vibration is transferred to the circuit board which amplifies the sound...    Replacing the coils is the best way to fix it, but a temporary fix is to lift the cabinet up and put a magazine under one side to flex the board enough to quiet the board (muffle it).  That might help, but it's not a permanent fix, and I have had to move the magazine from time to time as the board warms up....    It's a jury-rig I'll admit, but the Wheeeeeeeeee sound can drive you NUTS ! And Nutty people do awful things to their TV sets, so stay composed and hide all your baseball bats.    Some Techs might try either super-glue or silicone glue on the ferrite cores to stop the core from moving.

4KjLywFyaa	I used Tansee iPhone Transfer Photo. http://gutensoft.com/Utilities/Tansee_iP...  It can help copy both iPhone Library Photo ( the photos sync with iTunes) and iPhone Camera Photo ( the photos taken with iPhone Camera ) to your computer completely and safely. The whole process is very simple.  It also has detailed guide. Hope it helps.|`|ARYLg8ghaa	itune blocks this function since itune is the tool with one way to transfer files from itune to iphone. you must utilize other tools to achieve that. There're couple of tools for transferring the files between iphone and computer (for backup)depends on your demands, e.g transfer only songs/videos, transfer photos etc. You can have a look of below review site, hope it useful.
t3zBJbZEaa	You are on the right track, it is loosing the connections. Trace it to where the connection problem is, does it come from one speaker only or both? (if one Speaker maybe speaker if both then wires). If you can trace it and/or open the speaker(s) go for it, otherwise they're done.  good luck.
IALsvRn8aa	look at the end where you plug it in and see if the tip comes out if it does your mic wont work also if you have a second controller or a friend that has a controller i would try to use it in another controller and see if it works.|`|lAnb5Qq4aa	See if your batterys are low ,sometimes the mic wont work when the batterys are ready die.|`|yrYQHbYAaa	check the response below, also on the wireless mics there is a mute option on it, it may be a stupid question but if the wired mic has the same option then you may have muted it.

7L0p6Hciaa	All 3!    Pretty much any record player will let you play any, so why not just build a collection of the 3 formats? 7" and 12" singles are usually fairly cheap and a good way of bulking up your collection, and there's nothing better than throwing an LP on and laying in bed listening :)|`|HM4BAE18aa	All depends on the reason for starting it really.If your collecting for investment purposes there are a lot of good 7" records worth buying.I tend to buy certain labels rather than just artists on 7" as its hard to remember all valuable tracks but there are a lot of defunct labels about.Deram and Tamla motown are always a good buy.If your seriously collecting you should get a copy of record collector ,this will give you price guides on the value of records.They also do a monthly magazine with tips on old collectibles and future ones.There are obviously lots of 12" and Lp's that are very collectible as well.    If you are collecting for Dj ing then the obvious choice is 12" as they will have a longer version of the track and also have break beats at the end to make mixing into your next track easier.Depending on the type of dj ing you may need LP's and,or 7" as well as some older tracks will only exist on these formats.    If like me you just prefer records because of there rawness and purity then you will have hours of fun listening to all formats and especially Lp's.  Records have the more basic sound, unadulterated by sound engineers and Technology, Cd's tend to be perfect an unflawed which takes away the rawness of the music.Listen to an early rolling stones record and do the same on Cd its like a different group.    The other thing about vinyl of course are the sleeves as your not just getting music you also get some of the best art of its time.Record sleeves are collectable on there own and by far better to read while listening.some will also contain posters and other collectable pullouts.    There is nothing more satisfying than trying hunting down that special track or album and finding it tucked away in the back of an old charity shop or trawling the record shops,boot sales or record collector fairs and getting home with your find,sit back relax and listen,read the cover and   .............................Enjoy!!

SoF1F4uJaa	I seriously doubt it. iPod's are not meant to be used in extreme heat. Condensation will appear on the screen and probably all over the iPod and will seep into the machinery inside the unit. I highly advise against it.    You may be able to get heat-proof iPod protective cases though, I am not sure. But still, I wouldn't risk it.
epaT3Jpxaa	Do you mean the maximum number of pics in a single burst or the rate at which it fires?    You can alter the first issue by changing the 'quality' of the pictures, meaning jpg instead of raw and small instead of large. The buffer will accept more smaller images as opposed to large raw files. Check page 58 in your manual.    If you want to change the rate at which a burst actuates, check page 81 of your manual.|`|1abaa60b0511b1e2c248dd1b30e73037aa	with a pin

If there number is there then probably ur phone was in silent mode and so u were not aware that u've got a call. If their number's not there then there is either some problem with ur service provider or your friends are joking with you|`|4ef759a72bd240232f7647985dcd2818aa	When people call me, they sometimes get to hear that the number u have called is not reachable or switched off, while in reality its on.    I called myself from a different number, still the message was the same.    Of course, the Customer care can't help in this regard.    If u r planning to log in a Network / Connectivity related complaint, don't waste your time. If I try to remember, i can almost write the resolution. It sums up to a great joke. Once u hear it, you will burst out laughing    The SIM Service Provider is responsible, only for the SIM services. Naturally any other fault has to remain with the phone instrument manufacturer. And Vise a versa.    You can login a complaint with the SIM service provider, wherein they will give u a test call. If at that moment, the call goes through, the complaint is resolved, irrespective of what u say. If possible have a witness (franchisee would do). Or get your SIM card checked at any of the franchisee outlet.

e4hMIUGCaa	No.It is absolutely impossible to add (install) bluetooth to a device that has not designed for it before.To add Bluetooth capability its need to paste a hardware of bluetooth transceiver ( an IC ) onto phone PCB,we call it motherboard in a PC, and a software to activate it.But there has been no space for it,as it wasnt designed so.Also,it is impossible to insert a menu to activate it,into the phone OS.It is unlike a PC where we can add a new hardware and installing the driver.|`|exe5U7ZUaa	I've never heard anything like that for phones. Bluetooth is not like a memory card for which you have a slot. So i don't think that u can install bluetooth in your phone. However, if it is possible, you may have to make some major changes in ur phone
V1O7N02saa	Its possible that by June/July a new iPhone may be announced. Those are just rumors though.

Not sure if there is any small fee attached though.

vgxEN4MGaa	Yo,    You'll only have to buy a PS3 once.    With the right settings on your PS3, games and blu ray movies will look insane. 360 looks good with component cables in HD, but PS3 has the upper hand slightly with direct HDMI connectivity. It will look as good if not better, some games such as MGS4 really show what the PS3 can do.    PS3's hard drive is upgradeable - its piss easy to do it as well. If you want to save some money and buy more games, get a low gig version and spend the rest on games. Then once your filling up space, just buy a laptop sata drive and google a guide how to upgrade. You can get 250gb drives for good prices.    I think the 160gb is limited, but look out for bundles like the Killzone 2 one with 160gb ps3. These can save you some money.    Anways, here are games to buy if you get a ps3.    * killzone 2 - feb 27  * metal gear solid 4  * resistance 2  * little big planet  * gta iv  * mirrors edge  * fight night round 4|`|9AR6B4ELaa	erm...iwouldnt say that as xbox has better graphics (the games). but the ps3 has the blu ray which is high definition. it can be projected on a big screen and yet its still as clear. but the xbox, only the games are clear.|`|b2aw7iWtaa	ok, i just got one for Christmas and i like it, the controllers are motion sensitive, (i didnt know...). the batteries last a long time, it looks completely bad a$$ sitting on my tv stand, it doesnt sound like  jet taking off when you start it... the home navigation is different, idk if you will like it more or not tho, it has free online, although i must say that xbox has a better online setup...( doesnt matter because if its not free im probably not going to have it XD). and as for how it is going to look, i think it will be the same. you can look on youtube that has videos compareing the xbox and ps3 right next to eachother and i dont think their is a difference...|`|j6NImFHgaa	My husband has been thinking of getting one.

YmVYKNLiaa	There are 36 total vehicles in Mario Kart Wii (6 bikes and 6 karts for each weight class.  Most are unlocked by getting 1st place in grand prix cups.  The rest are unlocked by getting star rankings on races or by unlocking staff ghosts in time trial mode.      Automatic drifting has your vehicle automatically start drifting if you turn enough.  It is easier but you don't get any mini turbos.  Manual drifting requires you to press b button (to hop) and begin turning to drift.  It is harder to control but you get mini turbos if you drift long enough.|`|CcJdEaRpaa	drift by jumping and holding down the button.|`|ixzVKzBjaa	There are 36 vehicles in this game.  To unlock them, you must win more cups with a star rank and unlock more staff ghosts in Time Trial.    The difference between manual and automatic is that when setting the drift mode to manual, you are able to drift at a reasonable time and give free mini-turbo boost.  When setting the drift mode to automatic, you aren't able to drift and give free mini-turbo boost.    To drift, you must drift at a reasonable time unless you are about to hit an obstacle or fall into out-of-bound.|`|61KNbfIuaa	30 i think, 10 small, 10 medium and 10 large, but that includes bikes so if you want just karts its 15    on manual if you press b when you turn, you drift    (at least i think its b)|`|vqDDyVrQaa	To unlock the cars play single player grand pix (I'm not sure what it's that might be it). Anyway just play 50cc, 100cc & 150cc on all the stages (Preferably come in 1st place). You will unlock the other 4 stages as you complete the stages you already have.

AA11256390	http://uk.lge.com/products/model/detail/...  Have you had a look on the LG website as it says there the max you can use and it is 4GB, I wouldn't recommend trying any bigger because it probably won't function properly (I'm guessing you already know that though!) The internal memory has no effect on the external memory, it just means that you can store 15MB of files, pics, info etc before it's full and then have to use a memory card. You will still have a full 4GB on the microSD. Transflash and microSD are the same ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TransFlash ) and both can be used in devices which takes the other. LG don't mention using microSDHC so I'd stick with the standard version, that might be why people are struggling to get them to work. Also, try and stick to a memory card make that's well known as getting really cheap ones could also be a factor in them not working correctly. Hope this clears things up a little, if you need any more let me know|`|PVgMArd9aa	4GB my friend or less it wont support any bigger. Gd Luck

I don't know if you saw the Seinfeld episode where Kramer gathered up a bunch of bottles to take to Michigan to get the higher 10 cent redemption value but that was a better idea than this one.

The amount you are going to get is going to be so small it would take many many years to get any tangible amount. You'd spend more money extracting it than you would make off the gold itself. After all, these things weigh a few ounces, and gold is very dense and heavy, so there can't be much in there.

It's a wireless connection medium.|`|b61d886af315be700deb5ff41c372d68aa	Wikipedia gives a good concise response.     The longer answer is that Bluetooth is the technology that allows you to pair your device wirelessly with another device. Think of it as an invisible cable. The most common one we see is paring your cellphone with a wireless headset. You can also use it to pair your cell phone with a laptop to transfer contacts or other data. I can utilize bluetooth to tranfer the word documetns in my PDA to another PDA or computer if I choose as well.  Some companies pair devices like barcode scanners and GPS pucks via bluetooth. This allows them to move scanned data to company info stored on a spreadsheet within a blackberry or lap top or track the whereabouts of a company vehicle utilizing the nearest paired cell phone. Its basically a substitute for a short cable to link technological devices.|`|AA11021852	Everything you need to know about bluetooth is in wikipedia.

4ff941dcfe7bdf12fb08d124e7ff11eaaa	Well I have Nextel.I don't use my direct connect that much either.Instead I use my cell more, I think I have the best plan EVER "national free incoming 300" all incoming calls are free with unlimited long distance.Now I don't know how much u talk on ur phone but I talk around 6000 minutes and 90 direct connect minutes a month and that plan is PERFECT for me.   :)|`|AA12190403	Tmobile is coming out with the Sidekick III on July 10. You should definitley look into that.|`|8315d2da43581be1fc1e0717e3fbc18baa	Before you sign up for a new contract you should check around for the best deal but beware of the small print.  You also should consider if you only use the cell phone occasionally you might want a pay by the minute plan.      I researched and found the best minute to minute plan is Virgin Mobile (888-322-1122).  The phone I picked cost $39.99 (or $49.99?)  and has a lot of great features.      It's a good plan for me since I only use the phone a few minutes a day to call home or meet up with appointments, etc.  I don't use it for idle chatter which makes my 25cents per minute anywhere in the country cheaper in the end (after 10 minutes the rate becomes 10cents per minute on a daily basis).   Their customer service is great and can answer all your questions.    I chose Virgin because they were the only minute by minute plan that allows you to roll over your unused minutes if you automatically top-up your account balance with a $15 minimum every 3 months (enough time for my monthly cost to be only $5 per month) but you can add more money when ever you need it.    I can check my account on-line and see details of every call.  They have other plans but I didn't pay attention to them enough to recommend them.      I like not having a contract since I use it so seldom and they use a major cell phone company with excellent coverage across the country.  P.S.- I block phone messages and text messages since I don't need those services and don't want to pay for the minutes they would use up.|`|c9591a04856e2f7f51394aa2d211717eaa	Switch to T-Mobile. I have them; they're great. There are so many great plans to choose from.|`|b61d886af315be700deb5ff41c372d68aa	go to compass.t-mobile.com and make sure T-Mobile has adequate service in the areas you need it most. that will tell you if they are an option. Since Nextel has the smallest of the major American networks chances are T-Mobile is okay if they are. The Sidekick II is alright but it's not bluetooth so it has some limits there. The closest thing T-Mobile has to the Fusic is the SDA phone. I'd recommend looking into that one as well.

However the Sidekick lll is coming out on July 11 and is supposed to be 100% better and the cost is the same. Wait for the Sidekick III. Juicy Couture Sidekick is $500. a bit pricey even for me.

fa0fa5ff3aeece2e81ca180577667838aa	My Motorola V710 plays MP3s...it came with a sample preloaded.  I never transferred MP3s to the phone, but I did use the Transflash card.  If your computer has an SD card port, then you can put that little card into the SD adapter that comes with the card and then put it into the computer.  If you don't have an SD reader, you can buy an external one for less than $20.  Since the V710 is an older phone, it may only play one MP3 at a time, and it does not have stereo speakers.   You will need to buy headphones that connect to the Motorola specific headset port.  You can't set the MP3 as a ringtone either.|`|4952d4a4e55b07ac45ef53b45cde7804aa	you cant...motorla V710's are not MP3 compatiable.  you cant go to the manufacturer website or call your phone provider they will tell you the same thing|`|AA10986400	Go to the Motorola site and search for your phone and there you can see the related accessories.

f6caf62d8bd21327c7004d287fe5042eaa	Nextel, as well as other cellular service providers bill the rate plan a month up front. What this means is that when you start service you will be billed for the actual time you've had the service in your first billing cycle (pro-rated charges) PLUS for one full month. So if your first bill generates after one full month it would be about double. If it generates after a half month it should be about 1 1/2 times a normal bill. You also need to realize there could be a $36 activation fee on your first bill with Nextel. go to page 4 of your bill to break down the charges from page 3.|`|5d6c0901b2972992ec696393c0d56117aa	My first bill was higher than normal.

For what it's worth, I've had Nextel for years, and I'm very satisfied with them.|`|9f5f3d3e1218b3ceba76e6029345e403aa	I have a feeling that you were unaware that the $70 charge was for EACH phone per month. Alot of people get confused and I have seen it happen to other people where they think it is $70 for both phones per month.  Call NEXTEL to get precise information on your new contract and if you aren't happy, ask if you can switch to a more comfortable plan. Check out the rates at NEXTEL/SPRINT website  http://www.nextel.com before calling|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Regardless of what company you start with your first month's bill will be higher.   First you have your activations fees for each phone, which is usually 36 dollard for the first phone and 18 for the second phone.    Then you will pay at least a pro-rated rate for the month you started and one full month.

The best solution is to get a "pre-paid" account and use it for 6 months to establish a history.    good luck|`|f87fdb95c3ca58bad59ad7f9b62b0286aa	I had really bad credit. I needed a phone.

STAY AWAY from PREPAID! You will pay so much more in a few months time rather than paying a deposit. And free night and weekend minutes won't do you anygood if your phone is "shut off" from running out of prepaid minutes. And with the deposit - as long as you pay your bill you will get the deposit back.|`|aea6368b7672e4b00975315c1e6178e3aa	CINGULAR IS BETTER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	1. It is normal for tmobile. They have bad credit/ no credit    2. All the contract ones will ask for a deposit for this person with this type of credit. Spint users who need an  average deposit of 150. Only if you had Sprint in past and didn't pay will they ask for 250.    3. Try Sprint. The deposit isn't very high.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	I went to some confereance sometime ago where both Blackberry and Palm reps treid to sell theri phones. The only distinctions I rember are these.    Email: Blackberry's emailing capabilities are kinda independent from the cellular provider, so you communicate faster with your clients and it was able to manage more email accounts. Your email is synced automatically and so are schedules and things like that. Especially if lots of your communication is with your corporation.     Typing: Ergonomics. The board for the blackberry is easy to use so you can type quickly, while palms you have to take out the stylus      Devices like the palmtreo are used a lot by realtors. They have an infrared light on it that can unlock houses that are up for sale. Many of the most popular real estate programs out there are made exclusivlly for the palm.|`|9247af5be264308fd995777d14c98069aa	pda's are basically mini computers...|`|AA12053353	For all intents and purposes, the Blackberry is a PDA, and a very good one.    At this point, smartphone/PDA/mobile email devices are more or less the same thing . . .     Blackberry does not run Windows OS, and while you can do text editing on some text docs, its not particularly easy; the mobile Windows devices are a better bet there, but even then, you can't see a full screen layout on a PDA, so you'll just be text editing.    Blackberrys sync with your computer just fine, and work well with corporate Exchange servers.    I find Blackberry ergonomics better than other devices . . .YMMV

AA10022099	http://www.tracfone.com it is awesome it is a prepaid phone with no age limits no montly bills no hidden fees/costs and no contracts and with all the calling features such as free voicemail free caller id free call waiting and free nationwide long distance. all for as little as $10 a month calculated minimum usage because you have to buy a minute card every 60 or every 365 days depending on if you bought the year service card because the cheapest minute card is 20 dollars and you would have to add one every 60 days it would be around $10 a month which isnt bad. Hope this Helps!!!!!! Tracfone Wireless is awesome good luck choosing your phone!!    P.S. and a phone kit is only about $20 bucks @ your local walmart walgreens and family dollar stores etc. this includes up to 20 minutes and 60 days of wireless service included  And I will tell you when Tracfone Says they have "Nationwide coverage" they absolutely mean it I use it all the time and I would rather have nationwide coverage across the U.S. than have free mobile web on fridays with boost mobile but it all depends on the user preference or even if you want to make the monthly cost go down get a year service card for $100 and it works out to be $8.33 a month which is even cheaper than the $10 I mentioned earlier.    Hope this helps!! :)     Plus they offer a 30 day* money back guarantee + one year warranty on the cellphone at no addl' cost.     What I would do if I was U is make up a emergency situation and tell ur parents that because u dont have a phone you wouldnt be able to get help in a emergency if you are really tight on money otherwise if you have $20 dollars to get one at your local Walmart I will be able to get you 120 minutes free by doing refer a friend on their website this is $30 dollars worth of airtime.

All family plans from the major cellular providers have unlimited talking to other members of your family.Parents love you and want to spend time with you. They often feel guilty that they don't spend time with you. With a phone you'll be able to talk more to your parents when your at a bustop waitng. Really emphasie how it  help will you communicate with them better, since they're so busy. Induce guilt.    After she is motivated, you still have to convice her it is economical.   If she already has a cell phone, her company will probably will give her a new free phone for only about $10-$20 a month more.    If she doesn't already have service. Sprint has a plan for two people only 59 a month. If your mom is part of a credit union it would only be 53 a month.

At the stores that are not closing the prices wll be the same, bt at the stores that are closing you can get these phones for like 40% off retail. If there all gones from the closing store's inventory, go to a non-closing store and buy a used A900 where you get it for like $80 cheaper than normal retail.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	Im not in Texas, but Sacramento was one of ther first  five(?) cities they had reception in, so I think we should be a valid model on how reception in your city will be like.    Awfull. People in my town appreciate the low rates, but also have nicknamed MetroPCS  GhettoPCS.   I don't know anyone in Sacramento who would say their reception is decent. As a matter of fact, I'm confident that if you randomly asked Sacramentans for the company with the worst cellular reception. 95-99% of them would say Metro.

AA10022099	I am a teenager with a small amount of money and so is my sister so we found a Cellphone Solution with Tracfone. Especially when it is as low as $8.33/month http://www.tracfone.com it is awesome it is a prepaid phone with no age limits no montly bills no hidden fees/costs and no contracts and with all the calling features such as free voicemail free caller id free call waiting and free nationwide long distance. all for as little as $10 a month calculated minimum usage because you have to buy a minute card every 60 or every 365 days depending on if you bought the year service card because the cheapest minute card is 20 dollars and you would have to add one every 60 days it would be around $10 a month which isnt bad.

I have quite a few tracfones and they are the best phones and service I have EVER had!!!    It also chooses the most reliable wireless carrier for the zipcode you enter so you will get the best possible reception for your home calling area zipcode. Example: my calling area is in zipcode 61554 and so tracfone chose U.S. Cellular as my cellular carrier and it has awesome reception 7 bars!! almost all the time!! So no dropped calls!     I also forgot to mention their is no daily access fees/charges because all those fees are included in your prepaid airtime card prices.    I also want to tell you something more about tracfone is that they have "nationwide" coverage in the united states even in hawaii alaska and the U.S. virgin islands. I originally wanted a prepaid Alltel U phone like baconman02 but to my surprise Alltel had no coverage whatsover in my hometown zipcode so tracfone worked for me.|`|AA11619192	I think that it'd have to be T-mobile. I was so close to getting that one, but the only reason I didn't was because I talk and text way too much for prepaid. But you should definitely get T-mobile.|`|c89d829bf066f48885ab144f745e3e84aa	try boostmobile  you can chirp people (who also have walkie talkie) for only $1 a day, instead of wasting minutes by calling.|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	If your goal is no contract and no credit check, but still plan to talk as much as another person. I would recomend Cingular because their plan inlcudes unlimited nights and weekends, and service will cut off   when the minutes are used up. Expect to at least 60 a month.     If your goal is to have a phone instead of a payphone. I recomend Virgin Phones. Twenty dollars will last three months, $6.66 a month, assuming you don't use up the minutes. It's easy to add money to your account and  to talk to a company representative.     They have many differnent pricing options as well, giving you flexibility on your going to pay for it.
AA10503691	try celltradeusa.com and you can offer it to someone that would continue your contract.  phone companies do not advertise this but you will not be penalize if someone continues your contract.  you can alos check for some phone that you might be interested.|`|AA11933942	The only thing I know is to find someone who upgraded to a different phone and get their old one.

Its not going to be your Ipod. If T-Mobile ends up with the 6133(see 6136, 6126) then you have the option of micro sd expansion. (1gig) you only have 4.2 MB internal shared memory for contacts, text messages, multimedia messages, ringing tones, images, video clips, calendar notes, to-do list, and applications.|`|82f01eb1519c0efa6241fa3b95ff45bcaa	Nope it has very few memory, and not expandable.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	No I don't want them hooking up.     Here's why. Cing is GSM while Veri is CDMA. Two very different technologies. If they combined the tech into 1 unit then the phones  prices would increase and therefore the service prices would go up as well.     Also dropped calls would  increase. When your using different cell towers from different companies then dropped calls increase. If the companies merged and were constantly switching between the different towers dropped calls could increase.    Oh yeah. It won't happen. SInce Veri is CDMA they would probably hook up with another CDMA first like Metro or Sprint. Cingular would hoop up first T-mobile.    Companies can't merge, becasue of monopoly regulations.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	With a new activation or an upgrade Verizon gives a $200 instant discount. This means that if the phone is currently selling for $30 then the original value of the phone was $230. 230-200= 30. $230 is how much your going to pay if you buy it new.    A used deal from ebay is best.|`|395396b30c94e59ac464b6e1f29406f8aa	Check on Ebay.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	It's easy. Just spell the word. For instance with   the word BAT you would hit B then A then T. The word won't look like the word your trying to spell unill you type the last letter.      Every letter you hit, the program makes a guess using its internal dictionary what word your trying to spell.    Withoug T9 you would have to hit the AB key  twice then wait then hit AB key again then hit T. It's super fast; that's why you want to use it.|`|AA10891378	T9:    When spelling a word, tap each key once for each letter in the word. Ex. Phone = 7-4-6-6-3.   Alternate words will be displayed on the screen as a list. Use the Joystick to select the desired word. Press Continue or insert a Space to choose the desired word.    I ask someone in the past about this question on the site that I listed in my source.  They have a cool section where you can ask them any question about a cell phone in their contact area.

Find a patient person over the phone who will help you find another plan, that is not located on a brochure.     If they gave you crappy service. you can probaly get them to credit yousomething. Most of the flecibility will come from buying your phone. A non big name authorized dealer might get you an awesome price on a phone.

The sending a text message telling you that you have a text message you are charegd ten cents a text message. The unlimited text messaging plan is $15 too.    So if you wanted unlimited internet and unlimited texting you would pay an extra $30 a month.|`|ec29a12f6b9c67b90f85999587cac275aa	$15 is for unlimited text messaging.  If you want to browse the web, you need to pay another fee.  It all depends on what plan you have because they have different plans.

GSM :  The Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM) is the most popular standard for mobile phones in the world. GSM service is used by over 2 billion people across more than 210 countries and territories [1] [2]. The ubiquity of the GSM standard makes international roaming very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. GSM differs significantly from its predecessors in that both signaling and speech channels are Digital call quality, which means that it is considered a second generation (2G) mobile phone system. This fact has also meant that data communication was built into the system from very early on. GSM is an open standard which is currently developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).       The GSM logo is used to identify compatible handsets and equipmentFrom the point of view of the consumer, the key advantage of GSM systems has been higher digital voice quality and low cost alternatives to making calls such as text messaging. The advantage for network operators has been the ability to deploy equipment from different vendors because the open standard allows easy inter-operability. Like other cellular standards GSM allows network operators to offer roaming services which mean subscribers can use their phones all over the world.    As the GSM standard continued to develop, it retained backward compatibility with the original GSM phones; for example, packet data capabilities were added in the Release '97 version of the standard, by means of GPRS. Higher speed data transmission has also been introduced with EDGE in the Release '99 version of the standard.

This presented many problems directly related to compatibility, especially with the development of digital radio technology. In 1982, The GSM group ("Groupe Spcial Mobile" (French) 1, 2, 3 and 4) was formed to address these problems. The name of the system comes from the name of this group, though later the decision was made to keep the initials but to change what they stood for. Originally the group was hosted by European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations (CEPT).    From 1982 to 1985 discussions were held to decide between building an analog or digital system. After multiple field tests, a digital system was adopted for GSM. The next task was to decide between a narrow or broadband solution. In May 1987, the narrowband time division multiple access (TDMA) solution was chosen.    By the mid-1980s, many of the European countries had developed their own systems. This led to disagreement on what system to use. The conflict almost stopped the project. However, the European Union intervened and all 15 countries decided to choose the standard recommended by CEPT. In February 1987, eight different systems were tested in a competition held in Paris. A system developed by researchers Torleiv Maseng and Odd Trandem at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology won and was chosen. This was particularly surprising as they had no industry backing. Their system won by its ability to counter signal reflection in urban areas and in mountainous terrain.    The technical fundamentals of the GSM system were defined in 1987. In 1989, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) took over control and by 1990 the first GSM specification was completed, amounting to over 6,000 pages of text. Commercial operation began in 1991 with Radiolinja in Finland.    In 1998, the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) was formed. Originally, it was intended only to produce the specifications of the next (third, 3G) generation of mobile networks. However, 3GPP also took over the maintenance and development of the GSM specification. ETSI is a partner in 3GPP.    GSM provides recommendations, not requirements. The GSM specifications define the functions and interface requirements in detail but do not address the hardware. The reason for this is to not limit the designers yet still make it possible for the operators to buy equipment from multiple suppliers.    [edit]  Radio interface  GSM is a cellular network, which means that mobile phones connect to it by searching for cells in the immediate vicinity. GSM networks operate in four different frequency ranges. Most GSM networks operate in the 900 MHz or 1800 MHz bands. Some countries in the Americas (including the United States and Canada) use the 850 MHz and 1900 MHz bands because the 900 and 1800 MHz frequency bands were already allocated.    The rarer 400 and 450 MHz frequency bands are assigned in some countries, notably Scandinavia, where these frequencies were previously used for first-generation systems.    In the 900 MHz band the uplink frequency band is 890-915 MHz, and the downlink frequency band is 935-960 MHz. This 25 MHz bandwidth is subdivided into 124 carrier frequency channels, each spaced 200 kHz apart. Time division multiplexing is used to allow eight speech channels per radio frequency channel. There are eight radio timeslots (giving eight burst periods) grouped into what is called a TDMA frame. The channel data rate is 270.833 kbit/s, and the frame duration is 4.615 ms.    The transmission power in the handset is limited to a maximum of 2 watts in GSM850/900 and 1 watt in GSM1800/1900.    GSM uses linear predictive coding (LPC).

0bc482bea83a5e4c3c6925d5580560e3aa	iPods are Apple's version of an MP3 player.  The main difference is what file formats are supported.  iPods will support MP3, uncompressed WAV and Apple's AAC files, which are either M4A for unprotected or M4P for protected, which is what you get if you buy music from the iTunes music store.  iPods will NOT support WMA files, protected or not, which is what you would get from Napster, Musicmatch, MusicNow, FYE, and others.    Other brands of MP3 players will support MP3, WMA, and most will support protected WMA files as well but will NOT support the Apple AAC files.    My advice - stay away from iPods - the batteries can't be changed by the user - unless you "buy a warranty" you're gonna pay big buck$$$ to have a repair center change worn-out batteries for you.  Go with a SanDisk M200 series model.  Although you're doing this mostly with CD's that you already have, just make sure that when you rip the CD's into the computer, choose a file format that will be supported by your player - this is done via the "rip" settings in Windows Media Player.|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	IPOd is a brand. Regardless of what king of Mp3 player you getl, you will be able to transfer cd's to the MP3. The only exception are some fo the cellphones with built in MP3, where you may need to purchase songs exclusively from the cellular music store.    most mp3s gave a folder system    What makes the   Ipod unique?        With an Ipod you can purchase songs for as low as 99 cents from itunes which will only work on the ipod. They can offer these low prices, becasue patent holders are willing to trust the security of the ipod and not elsewhere.  the   All sorts of neat gadhets that the ipod has. For instance you can attach all of the following: an fm radio, voice recorder, remote control, exteranal battery pack, special boomboxes, special speakers and lots lots more.    Sound quality is awesome.   Most other MP3 players, you need to send the sound information to speakers via the headphone jack. That method of sending the information is not the beast for quality. You know that data connection on the ipod? It is a more effective method of sending the audio information and so the sound sounds better. Thats why you see so many speakers that are made specifically for the ipod data connector|`|7aab7558b1a8e923f76764982be634a0aa	Same thing but iPod is better|`|b063fa25865f362aeba966f838402350aa	ipod and mp3 is almost the same. mp3 is a tape of ipod.|`|AA10313718	A I-pod is an mp3 player... if it can play Mp3's its an Mp3 player... an I-pod is just the most popular Mp3player an Mp3 is a format of music like .wmp but, yea.. an Ipod is an Mp3 Player just like Dell is a computer, well anyeay.. u kno what i mean... and also, i think all Mp3 players let u organize ur music into folders..i havnt seen any that havent anyway.. id go 4 the I-pod|`|16fbbafbc818cb33c668441f3a684c4aaa	ipod is an mp3 player, it is just one brand.

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	First of all, lets clarify. Verizon phones don't have sim card so ignore the choices above.    It's still really easy though. Just make sure the phone is a Verizon phone, it has not been reported lost or stolen, and that it  is GPS enabled (if the phone was purchased less than two years ago its GPS enabled for sure.) Its against the law to sell new GPS enabled phones.    If your buying from ebay, make sure the person has sold lots of profucts, so you don't have to worry about the lost/ stolen part.    Once you get the phone, just call customer service and give them the serial number located beneath the battery. It will say ESN right next to it. The representative will say thank you tell you to put the battery back in and press     *228 then  press 1    It will tell you to wait while it is programing.    Then it will say your done.    That's it    Don't worry they won't charge you, and it will take less than five minutes for the entire thing to complete.|`|32e4b5535bf22917a5011eca6c345680aa	heck yeah.. most definitely.. it's easy just change your sim card into your new phone... if it doesnt work .. there's another way of doing it. when you buy a phone that's not compatible with your sim card.. it's easy enought to take your sell phone to one of those corner cell phone repair place and they'll just unlock it... like for instance you like a certain phone from cingular that  you like so much but can't end ur plan with verizon... unlocking ur phone would enable you to use any phone with any service...   but if you buy your phone online from verizon.. there shouldn't be a problem.. just change you sim from old phone and transfer it to the new one.   have fun with the new phone...|`|dc1b47e9989d7efe6ac35c9fa133dec5aa	Yes, just put the SIM card that is in your phone now into the one you purchase online.|`|909d3f86f38c29c78b79b769d7f15771aa	Most cellphone providers lock their phones to only be usable on their networks. If the phone you're buying isn't a Verizon-branded phone, it won't work on Verizon's network. You can however Google for "cellphone unlocking". Depending on the phone model you're thinking of buying, there may be a code you can enter to make it usable on any network.
824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	It allows for high speed internet, and advanced stuff like tv shows and the like for GSM/tdma compnaies like Cingularl and Tmobile.    Currently CDMA networks like Verizon and Spint have been able to do this with thier 3g networks. This is the GSM response.|`|98ff7f98e0c430a1f103550f194f4faaaa	EDGE provides up to three times the data capacity of GPRS. Using EDGE, operators can handle three times more subscribers than GPRS; triple their data rate per subscriber, or add extra capacity to their voice communications. EDGE uses the same TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access) frame structure, logic channel and 200kHz carrier bandwidth as today's GSM networks, which allows it to be overlaid directly onto an existing GSM network. For many existing GSM/GPRS networks, EDGE is a simple software-upgrade.     EDGE allows the delivery of advanced mobile services such as the downloading of video and music clips, full multimedia messaging, high-speed colour Internet access and e-mail on the move.     Due to the very small incremental cost of including EDGE capability in GSM network deployment, virtually all new GSM infrastructure deployments are also EDGE capable and nearly all new mid- to high-level GSM devices also include EDGE radio technology. The Global mobile Suppliers Association (GSA) states that, as of April 2006, there were 139 commercial GSM/EDGE networks in 78 countries, out of a total of 192 EDGE deployments in 102 countries. The regional breakdown of commercial EDGE networks is 59 in Europe, 45 in the Americas and Caribbean, 21 in Asia, and 14 in Africa and the Middle East. The GSA notes that 212 EDGE devices are launched in the market, including 34 devices supporting both EDGE and 3GSM/W-CDMA, and 10 devices supporting EDGE and W-CDMA/HSDPA

824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	When I sold my old phone on ebay the person who wanted to purchase the phone asked for the Electronic Serial number also known as the ESN to ensure the serial number is not registered as stolen and/or unusable. She did this before she made her bid.    I was weary at first, becuase I thought maybe she was up to something, but then I realized my account is no longer attached to this serial number, so I said ok.     She ended up buying it after she verified it as an okay phone.    I actually think what she did was a good idea. If your buying from someone who doesn't have much ebay history you should do the  same.     However, if the person has a huge history of positive feedback i wouldn't worry about it.    Good luck|`|AA10243228	First off make sure you buy one from some one who has a lot of good feed back. Second make sure you get one that will work with your cell provider.

If so, it may be a problem with the phone, and you can either call the phone company or visit your phone provider's store and get it checked out. If they say you need to buy a new phone, argue that you shouldn't have to pay for a damage that you didn't create (i'm assuming you didn't throw it against a wall or anything. :P). If they keep arguing with you, ask to speak to a supervisor. Usually, they'll take care of that for you.    Other than that, it might be your speed dial settings. Go in to check your speed dials, and make sure the "1" is set to call your voicemail. Sometimes, it isn't.|`|824eefddf09fd139b4e0a4f86ef11e2eaa	I knew a lady whose "number 1" key was broken.

If not, usually just dial the number and then press pound. Sometimes the phone will save the settings from   when voicemail was set on 1.     She was very happy with the results.

bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	I am guessing you are looking at the Cingular Go Phones. Although I am a Nokia fan, the Motorola L7 is a MUCH BETTER phone then the 6102. The 6102 is the one weak offering in the Nokia lineup, plus the Motorola L7 will hold it's value much better if you ever want to re-sell it. The Moto phone has an expanable memory slot for MP3's and photo's, the Nokia does not. The Moto is a quad band, the Nokia is a tri band. If you were comparing the L7 to other Nokia models, my answer might be different but comparing those 2, the Moto blows it away. I give you this answer from a techical standpoint and from a standpoint of owning both phones  The Moto is a good buy at $90.00, the Nokia would be a good buy if it were $39.00  Cheers|`|55967b92b5a6ba9741236478c68f871caa	SLVR looks cooler, but I will always choose Nokia over Moto for quality.

When they are all ready, ok, go to compare the 3 listings and then you can know which is the one suitable for you. The one most suitable for you is the best one.   We can offer battery pack, if you need, pls. tell me, I will help you !
bd15441c0920c617077ac1881d213472aa	The Cigular phone has to be unlocked to use a T-Mobile sim card. If the phone is a basic Nokia, you can get the unlock code for free from some websites. This is only posible with older or the newer basic models from Nokia. The new Nokia bs5 phones can not be unlocked through remote code or through shops.   Sonys, Motos LG, Samusung etc... you will have to take it or mail it and pay to have it unlocked.  Edit: To correct some info posted below mine, you will not and did not ruin your t-mobile sim by putting it in a Cingular phone, you do not need to get a new sim. Also, T-Mobile does not know the code and will not unlock it for you, The carrier that has the code is Cingular but you are not a customer, they will not give it to you  Cheers|`|AA10408075	go buy a new sim card at radioshack, or walmart for about 20 bucks.|`|92e1ff4ff0c58646b7f134351c8cab26aa	go to the tmobile website, get the customer help number and ask the person what your sim password is for your account, they will be glad to give it to you|`|685ed4af8867fe554f1983939d72f575aa	you must first unlock the cingular phone. you also have to get a new SIM because you fried yours. AS for unlocking, it depends on the brand of phone. bring it into Tmobile or cingy and have them do it.

I don't know if you knew this already, but people use Limewire to put adware and spyware on your computer.|`|AA10841434	I know, I just don't know what to say. Maybe type in the specific video you're looking for.|`|76c41dab350b4fb258b728d7d1afdecfaa	Your question is a bit hard to understand so I can just tell you about limewire.    Limewire is a filesharing program that allows you to download music, video (movies and music videos), and pictures.    I think what you are asking is how do you find the "what's new" for audio?  well, it's simple.    On the top where it says Music or Audio, click it.  Then, go down to the bottom where it says keyword and what's new. Click what's new.  Um, if i'm wrong about your question, you could be asking "How do you search for music downloads with keywords?"  Well, that's easy too.  You click for audio or music i;m not sure since this pc doesn't have limewire,   and you search for it just like you did for music.|`|AA10289575	Illegal|`|800a0f6b26a6a5ee892b224b4059f1e1aa	beacause Audio and videos is different the videos is we see the movie and pic and the audio we see not no other thing
