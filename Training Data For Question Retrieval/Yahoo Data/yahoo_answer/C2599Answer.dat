D1v5UIgRaa	Get a water pump if it's in the same location as the timing belt. Get some silicone sealant as well for the pump. You may also need to replace the timing belt tensioner if it has one. Depending on the condition of the other accessory belts, it may be a good idea to get those as well since you will have to take them off anyways.|`|AA10483928	Yes there is a reason! It takes alot of time to get the motor down to a point where you can change the belt. and the water pump and tensioner should be replaced while doing the timing belt Unless you enjoy spending hours tearing into the motor when 2 weeks after you change the belt, your water pump goes out! IF it has enough miles 2 need a timing belt, it will need a water pump in the near future. Do it all at once and you wont have to worry about it later. Plus the tensioner and pump are relativly cheap. Labor is not!|`|PkzPIHciaa	Just get the belt.<br>  There's no need to replace the whole car.....
D1v5UIgRaa	There really isn't much you can do. The only thing I can think of that will give you a big increase would be nitrous. Cheap and you get power on the tap. Next thing would be boost. Turbo or supercharger. Costs more though. Things like intake and exhaust are pretty much useless for adding power.<br>  <br>  If you want your car to be more fun to drive, then I would suggest upgrading your suspension, wheels, and tires. A good combination of springs/shocks/coilovers will go nicely with a set of sticky tires.|`|s1qUJ4aJaa	Unfortunately Lancers definitely aren't my strong point.

JvxrCb2Paa	Never done this swap before, but I think you are getting some uninformed info from others, try <a href="http://www.engine-swaps.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.engine-swaps.com/</a> for more info. A 318 was available from the factory for the Dakota in 1992 so I don't think it would be too big a deal to go to an older 318 except for poor fuel mileage due to a carb. Flywheel and clutch might need some engineering, but I don't think it would be that difficult.|`|jsQhnXTiaa	You wouldnt have to change the fire wall but hes correct your talking about a lot of changes. Motor mounts, transmission, radiator, exhaust, steering linkage, springs to support a heavier engine. Just buy a Dakota with a 360. 318's are EXTREMELY good engines, I would find something to put it in, perhaps an older car. Think a muscle car *wink*|`|F1Qi7QzAaa	slot, motor mounts, radiator, hood, fire wall, too much, just get a v8 dakota|`|TifUsG4Maa	It,s alot of work for just a 318.Radiator,firewall,engine mounts and so on.It,s easier to just buy one with a 360 and pump up that motor.I have a mopar buddy of mine that has a 360 dakota and it runs low 13,s at the strip.He,s now building a 440 duster...Hey go for it..You,ll learn alot about fabrication!!!
BgwTxzEFaa	If it is slipping that bad, then of course your going to be filling up more often.

Is it discolored?  Does it smell burnt?|`|eYXGfGg3aa	This is what one website says about the Tiburon transmission issues:<br>  Transmission problems: If transmission sticks in 3rd, shifts poorly, or has harsh 1-2 shift, the pulse generator may need to be replaced.

Either that or save up|`|JwLJq05Iaa	Plus before you buy, check into the cost of insurance for the vehicle.  Depending on the car-your age-driving record, might be $$$$$.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	Yeah i agree.

r9H8AXIsaa	Quoted from the TSSC Forum:<br>  <br>  "There have been some kits that are semi bolt on for the gen 1/2 taurii, nothing has ever been available for the 3/4 gen taurii. There are products out there that would be a good start, bit not bolt on. Much research must be done, and alot of money must be had..." <br>  <br>  "Make sure you have the resources to attempt a project like this. It requires quite a bit of custom fabrication needed for mounting and plumbing. Installation of a supercharger can run up to about $3500 easily. Turbo -- at least $5000, and that's without the necessary tuning..."<br>  <br>  "Sometimes you may have the skill do do something, but your car does not have the capabilities. If your transmission will explode if you add 10 HP, then what good is the extra 50 that you're going to add? Naturally aspirated engines were designed to make as much power as they make stock, with some exceptions. Some internals will not handle the stress of more power- you may throw a rod! Be very careful and wary of doing something as drastic as this to an engine. If you are unsure that your car can handle it, BUY NEW INTERNALS! "<br>  <br>  <br>  "My suggestion is to find a different platform to modify and keep the Taurus as a daily driver..."|`|AA11275863	Put a turbo or supercharger on a Taurus? <br>  You better find a place to order head gaskets by the dozen.|`|6RuuSkDkaa	the 3.8 and 4.0 engines are notorious for blowing head gaskets all by themselves  the stock internals are engineered for economy not performance  anything is possible but what would be required to build it to last would greatly exceed the value of the vehicle
cAGv5evLaa	The amount of horsepower your engine makes can be graphed as a curve, shaped like an upside-down "U". This is to say that your engine has a certain RPM speed at which is makes the maximum amount of horsepower. When you see a car ad saying that a car has 240hp, that means that the engine makes that much power at a certain peak RPM - these magazines are just telling you the max horsepower AND the peak rpm speed you need to attain that power.<br>  In other words, when they list horsepower like that, it's their way of saying "this engine can make a maximum of this much horsepower, and it does so at this RPM".<br>  Power is all the same - and generally speaking, the lower the RPM is for max horsepower, the lower the engine's redline will be (redline is the max RPM the engine can sustain without damage, and it is indicated on your tachometer by a red line, hence the name). A lower-redline engine will generally have more torque at low-speeds, which means it will be able to accelerate faster from a stop - but that's only really useful for drag racing, like racing from a stoplight. However, the higher the peak RPM, the higher the redline of the engine, which means the car will be able to accelerate much faster when it's already moving - this is handy for real races on a track (or highway) where you have to accelerate past someone when you're already going fast.|`|addaf7237cf3d32190cfc96546e98709aa	It depends on what you like.<br>  <br>  HP at a lower RPM means quicker acceleration at slower speeds.<br>  For example;<br>  300HP@2000rpm means 0-60mph in 5 seconds and 60-120mph in 15 seconds.<br>  <br>  HP at a higher rpm means quicker acceleration at higher speeds.<br>  For example:<br>  300HP@5000rpm means 0-60mph in 6 seconds, but 60-120mph in 8 seconds.|`|uLEpOpSMaa	The more important factor then peak horsepower is the power curve.  Usually they don't make references to that in auto magazines.  The power curve is how much horsepower and torque an engine makes at all RPM levels.  <br>  <br>  For a street car, it's typically more desirable to make peak horsepower at a lower RPM.  But as long as the peak power is made within the car's shifting range, it will be fine.|`|dyzUHrUVaa	It is not really about which one is better. The only thing you need to be concerned with is which one is greater. Now, if you are going to be racing the vehicle and this is why you need to know, then this does matter. If you are racing the vehicle, when do you want to peak horsepower to come into play. Do you want peak horsepower at a earlier RPM or a later RPM. Obviously if you want to beat people off the line, you would want peak horsepower earlier then later.|`|sUEKomVJaa	Do you want maximum power later in the RPM range and have to wait for the engine to reach there OR do you want max power early on in the RPMs but then be left with nowhere to go.  That is an extreme example.<br>  <br>  Using your example above, I'd personally prefer 360hp @ 5400 RPM, why?  Well, you get an extra 60hp at only 400RPM more.<br>  <br>  However, what you should be concerned about more than horsepower is torque.|`|wpg6zTMQaa	Different engines make peak horsepower at different RPM's. Horsepower is horsepower they are just reporting the peak numbers for each.|`|29e2b9aab3acd4c52200fd47168e9500aa	That the max power rating for engine. This info alone cannot be used for comparison.<br>  :-)

You can easily find a VR-4 for under ten grand and still have some money for upgrades.  Stock they have 300HP with all wheel drive, definitely a good starting point.  The 300zx is also a good choice.  The only problem with these cars is that they are A LOT more complicated and harder to work on than a 4 cylinder Honda motor, but if you're up to the challenge it can be really rewarding.  A Nissan 240SX is another more inexpensive option with a huge selection of aftermarket parts.  You could pick one up and swap in an SR20DETT easily for under $10k, giving you a really fast car.  As far as reliability goes, I understand the headache that comes with turboing a civic and if you want a little more peace of mind and less hassle getting a 3000GT that's designed to run stock turbos will be much less of a pain.  Hope this helps.|`|MqaBeyPOaa	Acura Integra beats everything else by far! You can either get an LS and swap the engine or get a GSR then you won't have to swap.

43DHFQnKaa	there are 03/04 cobras that have automatics swapped in (which is not a good sign as usually only done for purposes of getting better times on the 1/4....that is to say they have been beat on).<br>  <br>  but is will not be the usual looking transmission handle,  it will be very stout and likely have a pistol grip set-up with a lever release....<br>  <br>  in any event here are the VIN decoders for 03 & 04 mustangs,  as you can see for both yrs the VIN has to contain the designation P48 or P49 to confirm its a cobra....(generally no one purchases a cobra, saleen, mach 1,  etc without confirming heritage).<br>  <br>  <a href="http://mustangattitude.com/mustang/2003vinmatrix.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://mustangattitude.com/mustang/2003v...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://mustangattitude.com/cgi-bin/statsexplorer.cgi?year=2004&f1=vinmatrix" rel="nofollow">http://mustangattitude.com/cgi-bin/stats...</a><br>  <br>  cheers 04 cobra|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	I bet he did.<br>  <br>  No real driving enthusiast who buys a Cobra swaps to an automatic or butchers that car with such an operation.<br>  <br>  Yeah, your b/f isn't that bright.

It's fake and mis-badged, which is DONE ALOT....a VERY LOT!<br>  (people will go as far as putting authetic cobra hoods, and body kits, and cobra badges too)<br>  <br>  2.) It's a v6 or GT mustang which has been MODIFIED to the levels of a Cobra mustang....theres alot of people that install GT-40 cylinder heads cobra intake manifolds, ECU or Chip, Exhaust.....and maybe install a Supercharger Kit............then they throw Cobra Badges on the car or do a Bodykit,etc....<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Here's an EASY way to tell if your driving a real 03-04 cobra.<br>  <br>  When your driving in it, LISTEN FOR THE SUPERCHARGER WHINE NOISE.<br>  (it's a fairly loud noise the 03 cobras were NOTORIOUS for....which comes from the M112 Supercharger unit.)<br>  <br>  Also, heres another way to tell....<br>  <br>  Take off in a straight line WITH THE PEDAL TO THE FLOOR just about.<br>  If you get thrown back into the seat REALLY REALLY REALLY HARD, or the car spins tires uncontrollably, then it's probably a Cobra with an aftermarket Auto Tranny....or it's a v6 or GT mustang with a Supercharger kit or Engine work done to it.
4biGrjPkaa	Your best bet is Ebay, I've had 3 Impreza turbos (classic shape 94-01) and did a lot of chopping and changing of exhausts trying to get it right. The bore is the same on the 2.0 non turbo but the 1.8/1.6 is smaller.<br>  <br>  The best set up I found was using an STi centre section (straight through) coupled to a prodrive back box. All in it costs around ￡130 but you may need to be prepared to wait til the right parts come up on ebay. Sounds great, not offensive, but brings out the flat 4's tones without any resonance.<br>  <br>  Be prepared to pay ￡130 for the prodrive back box alone, but you should get an STi full system for ￡20-￡30. Keep the centre section and put the STi back box back onto ebay, you'll get your ￡20-￡30 back.<br>  <br>  Not sure that you'll get anything decent for ￡100 if you want to buy brand new but you could try:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.larkspeed.com/index.pl?session=742224689" rel="nofollow">http://www.larkspeed.com/index.pl?sessio...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.demon-tweeks.co.uk/" rel="nofollow">http://www.demon-tweeks.co.uk/</a><br>  <br>  Hope this helps

WO68RZdIaa	Based on information I found online the average cost is going to be around $100 maybe less, probably more.<br>  <br>  You will not know exactly how much it is going to be until you get your courtesy letter in the mail in a few days/weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Personal observation:<br>  This is one objection I have regarding how citations are handled in CA. There is no fine amount printed on the citation & you usually won't know until you get your courtesy letter- sometimes a couple of weeks have passed by then from the time you actually received the citation. I have always wondered if that is a scam that CA runs. If the courtesy letter isn't mailed out until up to 2 weeks after the citation was issued, it's possible that you might have forgotten about the citation by then & the letter was misdirected or lost by the wonderful USPS- then they are going to get more money from you now since you will most likely have additional charges filed against you & a bench warrant for your arrest.<br>  <br>  CA needs to fix that to include the fine costs or do like a few other states & provide a phone number to call within 48 hours of receiving your citation to get your fine amount, options, etc instead of having to wait for a courtesy letter. At least then, CA would be saving paper and could claim to be going "green".|`|JkTGq2BJaa	look on the back of the ticket, it should tell you what the fine is, just match the code.

AA10980692	Sounds 100% like a vacuum leak. One other possibility is the floats in the carb are sticking when you come to a stop allowing too much gas to flow momentarily.

When a steady flow of water is visible close the screw and re check the water level but do not fill above the maximun level. Do not overtighten this screw as it will strip easily or remove as it will go and hide so you will not find it.<br>  Recheck the water level when cold but do not worry if the settled level is near the minimum mark. <br>  These symptoms are the classic pointers to head gasket failure but if the plugs are removed and one looks spotlessly clean then the gasket has gone on that cylinder.<br>  Best of luck|`|m0QrCHfHaa	You must bleed the cooling system of any air bubbles. Take off the radiator cap and run the motor for a few minutes. Then fill it up again. Keep doing that until the water level stops dropping in the radiator.|`|bgQP1Aquaa	I would check the thermostat.if it doesnt open at the correct temp the car overheats and you get no flow to the heater.when it opens all is well again.overheats =loss of power.

TTcRA9kkaa	Did they ever make a good one ?|`|GHefTsUyaa	There was a time when Rover made distinguished and quality cars.<br>  The last of the best Rover cars was the P5B model.<br>  <br>  Once the Rover name was swallowed up by British Leyland,it all went wrong.<br>  The SD1 model was the one that destroyed the previously proud name of Rover.That was from 1977 on.<br>  It was a good looking car, but the build quality was atrocious and Rover never really recovered after that.<br>  It was downhill from that point onwards!|`|CwNMq7RTaa	I don't know what the worst car ever made is, but the Saab is a nightmare.  The windshield wiper system is so complex that if you break a wiper by using it when there is ice on the windshield, it doesn't just break the blade, it breaks the whole motor which costs $300 to replace.   The ignition which is on the floor between the two front seats and not in the steering wheel is in the perfect spot to catch spilled coffee, which when it goes in freezes in the winter so you can't start the car.  If the engine is having a serious problem you don't know because the car keeps running perfectly until it just stops and never starts again.  By the time my Saab died I was ecstatically happy.  I had wanted to dump it for a long time but could not figure out how because I knew I couldn't sell it.  I parked it in the driveway, then walked to the store and did 2 weeks worth of food shopping and took a taxi home and then just enjoyed a nice long vacation of not having to deal with it.  Then I went out and got an Oldsmobile.  I was thrilled with the simplicity of it.  I'll buy a horse before I buy another Saab.|`|cPlDc7I1aa	i have a rover 25 (lord knows why we chose a rover, but anyway, i got it now!) and i have never had a problem with mine.

BgwTxzEFaa	It is going into the motor, and when coolant gets hot, it expands like all fluids.  So when the motor is hot, the coolant expands and takes up more space, so it fills up higher in the overflow bottle.<br>  <br>  Also, when your motor is cold, the thermostat is closed, so the coolant is not circulating through the motor, when the coolant heats up, the thermostat opens and the coolant circulates so it will cause fluctuations in levels.

That was because Ford put the wrong tires on the Explorers. Go with what the owners manual says.

That amount of money MIGHT be able to get you the engine's valve-train, but not the whole thing plus labor to get it in there. That is, unless you or a friend of yours know how to install it into the car. Engines usually run $1000 and on up, and for a '99 Civic, I'm going to guess about $2000.<br>  <br>  Either way, don't worry yourself. You did fine.

I have no remorse, and neither should you! A good car is worth whatever you want to pay for it, and yes, you could have gotten a better deal, but that's not the most important thing, which is that you bought a great car that will last you as long as you want. As long as you do regular maintenance and don't drive it like you stole it, the car will reward you for years, especially with that low mileage!!<br>  Congratulations on your purchase.

5xlBHmaCaa	yes it can. just get the right kind|`|AA12261615	anything that lets the exhaust escape quicker will help one,and some mufflers do that,it depends on the muffler though ,some will help one and some will hurt the performance of an engine,good luck.|`|ImgouTRIaa	It can , but not always. The concept here is this : say you have an engine displacement of 2.5 L / 2500cc.  The engine needs to be able to be able to utilize he potential for all 2.5 liters of power making displacement engine , burning the fuel completely and efficiently throughout the idle to full throttle range of function. Some mufflers  as well as intake setups can be too restrictive ( usually factory setups) can hamper the engine performance. Hence, the aftermarket is full of low restriction intakes and exhaust kits ready and tuned for your particular vehicle. On the other hand , a muffler that is too open , or free flowing, can burn exhaust valves and drag performance down too. An engine needs a certain amount of back pressure provided by the exhaust system to run properly, and there are engineering formulas that generate exactly what exhaust / intake equipment that will make the most power. Smart would check out performance magazines and hook up with other genuine gear heads to maximize your dollar to performance bang, because louder is not necessarily more powerful or faster, just louder and perhaps slower and even less than what you started out with. (stock)|`|qkvoAYoeaa	In reading your question literally you seem to be asking, "Is there a muffler that will add horsepower to my car?"   And, the answer there is that mufflers have no means of producing power within themselves.  There are some mufflers that will allow the engine to generate more horsepower and torque by relieving back pressure in the exhaust system.  The engine exhausts the burned fuel gases more efficiently leaving space for more fresh fuel to be injected for the next power stroke.  The system may be further augmented by use of headers and by 'tuning', as done in drag racing, hot rodding, etc.|`|6137572ac3c860420eba86c0f0f9061aaa	It is in a way.  Mufflers block the flow of exhaust gasses to some extent reducing HP.  The more you open up that flow the more you increase the HP.  So some mufflers will produce higher HP than others but all mufflers reduce the HP from an engine without one at all.|`|zOnyz5Tnaa	the year of car well tell me - 72 back yes - 81 back maybe - 82 no<br>  OBD 1 maybe|`|AMYXuD2Caa	ih8pplthatyell&espthosewhodontusespacesp...|`|uyxbZTQIaa	Mufflers restrict airflow, so removing your muffler should give you even more power.  Unfortunately, it is not always true, you need back pressure on newer electronic controlled cars, so removing your muffler or changing it might give you even less horsepower.
jsQhnXTiaa	Well my friend you need to upgrade the Intake, get bigger fuel injectors, installing 1.7 roller rockers will give you more lift on your cam *its complicated on how it works but it will give you more lift*. Change out your cam with a hot cam. Still will be streetable and you could have ordered it from the factory back then and it adds a good 30-50 horsepower gas mileage only drops by 1 or 3 mpg. Port and polish your heads, you have great heads but porting and polishing them will make them even better and you wont have to change anything. You can change the pistons and add more compression. Your compression right now is about 9.5 to 1 i would bump it up to about 10.5 or 11. If you did all of this, I would say your looking at about 450-500 rwhp. Trust me, lS1's love mods. And the parts are cheap on these cars, good luck bud. Want any more detailed answers just ask me.|`|8zVxYkluaa	Change over to a LS6 intake manifod..$325-375 used on the various LS1 boards and an few hours install.<br>  <br>  Don't listen to these jackasses telling you to rebuild the motor, "balance and blueprint"(I doubt the person that suggested it doesn't even know what it means).  You specifically said it's your daily driver and these people are telling you to bore this, polish that....I love reading some of these responses.  You also don't have 9.5:1 compression, it's 10.1:1.   You could do a cam and it won't really change the reliability provided it's not something super big.  You could do a good aftermarket torque converter if the car is an automatic.  It won't gain you horsepower but it'll net you faster times at the track and make the car quicker.  A GOOD converter won't really change the street manners much(it'll depend on how the trans settings are changed in the PCM and what brand converter you get).<br>  <br>  I guess another question no one addressed is A) How much power do you want to gain and B) What is your budget?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://ls1tech.com/forums/" rel="nofollow">http://ls1tech.com/forums/</a> <br>  <br>  Start reading, there's a good external engine section.|`|7sA8HwTzaa	Have the engine balanced and blueprinted.|`|4soY7ukzaa	I am a big fan of port polish and bore. when you do it, change all the parts over to racing. I find this is the big power boost. also when you do it, you can build it for a super charger, NOS, or any other power boster you can think of. bore it out bigger so you get more compression and work from there. <br>  <br>  I like to work from the inside out when I do engines. Other wise you build the out side and then over time you build inside. But you end up replacing the outside a second time. Just a waist of time. Do it right the first time and save time and money|`|4HfllNooaa	If you have already upgraded the intake and exhaust system, your next step to make more power is to start upgrading engine parts. In which you have many options. Do you want to go N/A or boosted, that depends on your power goals. If your looking for a moderate boost in HP across your RPM range go N/A and build the motor. High compression pistons, cams, valve springs, retainers, bore over the cylinders, port and polish...etc Then of course TUNE!

6en8QlaUaa	The title transfer process varies from state to state however, the safest course of action when transferring a title to a private party is to meet them at the dmv and transfer it with both of you there. That way you know for sure it is done correctly.<br>  <br>  If you hand a title to someone and they don't transfer it then you are legally responsible for anything that happens with the car as long as it is in your name.

Example - where I live to make a journey of 4 miles takes an hour and twenty minutes by public transport but only takes 10 to 12 minutes by car. There is also the convenience of a car - if you're transporting shopping or larger items then public transport - bus is unrealistic especially with the smaller metro buses and taxis are prohibitively expensive. Taxis will drop you off outside your destination, buses won't but cars nearly always do. There is no need to wait for your own vehicle but there is with all other modes of public transportation.|`|3kpnzv5vaa	public transport can be delayed, cancelled, late, overcrowded, dirty, stressfull, expensive, even dangerous - late at night.<br>  <br>  Ideally I would drive to work becuase I dont like waiting at bus stops - I dont like sharing the bus with noisey school kids going nuts.<br>  <br>  Driving is far more comfortable, quicker and you have more control - put the radio on, put the air con on - stop on the way to do a bit of shopping.<br>  <br>  Can be abit expensive though - especially in London where I am - congestion charge, parking etc.|`|Qeor2wKLaa	To get to work on public transport woud take me about 3 hours, in a car it takes 35 minutes.<br>  <br>  To carry shopping from supermarkets.<br>  <br>  To travel at times when I want to travel i.e. not wait for buses.<br>  <br>  Even if public transport was superb, people would still have cars as status symbols.|`|UAW1U3Uoaa	convenience of being able to go where you want when you want, not having to rely on time tables, and because public transport is expensive, unreliable, dirty, noisy and uncomfortable.

Some people don't live close to public transport, so owning a car is a necessity.  Mixed mode transportation is another possibility, where someone who drives takes his car to the nearest public transport point and parks it there and continues his route using a subway, a bus or a train.<br>  <br>  For people who have more than one child, a car in my opinion is a necessity.  It is practically impossible to use public transport in my area with a double stroller and the various things that one would need when taking care of children (diapers, spare clothing, food, etc).  Just imagine going food shopping with 2 children, a stroller and multiple bags inside a bus.  It is just not feasible.<br>  <br>  Also, as a home owner, a way of transporting things is very important when doing renovations, or buying things for the house.<br>  <br>  I'm all for public transport and use it partly to go to work, but wouldn't be able to survive without my car.|`|G5R8B0Wpaa	This would vary by location,  but the biggest reason people have cars is convenience and our culture.     <br>  <br>  I once talked a young man out of getting a car.

AA11435704	What happened is you were "spot delivered" which means that the dealer let you take the vehicle before the finance company approved the deal. They would have had you sign a form saying that if they can not get the financing approved, you will return the vehicle.<br>  <br>  The dealer does this for several reasons. They want to take you out of the market, meaning that you are no longer shopping for a deal. They know that once you have driven the car, and shown it off to family and friends, you most likely will do whatever it takes to keep the car, meaning coming up with more money down or a co-signer.<br>  <br>  Take the car back to the dealer, Because they can not get the financing approved, they have to refund all money that you paid them, and return your trade in to you. Do not agree to pay mileage or use charges. If they claim that they did repairs or clean up on your trade, tell them thank you, but you are not paying for it.  If they back the deal out, then you get what you gave them back, and they get the vehicle that they gave you back.<br>  <br>  Call them and tell them that you will be returning the vehicle, and expect that they will have a check ready to refund all your money. When they find out that you will not modify the deal in any way, they may just get the approval after all. If not, start looking again.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	They should not have let you take possession of the car until the paperwork or loan had been approved.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  <br>  No kidding.<br>  <br>  It's not the OP's fault for trying to buy a vehicle he had no business buying.<br>  <br>  I bought my 2003 F150 back in August 2007 for $9000 with no down payment needed, though I put a $1000 deposit (yes, $1000 on my own accord + $200 more for the hell of it because I could bling it) that was never needed...<br>  <br>  Why?  Because I made $58K that year, had upwards of $10K in my savings account with my credit union I got the loan from and knew what I could buy.<br>  <br>  I bet the OP isn't in that great a financial shape to where he makes about 6.5 times what that Exploder costs.  That's a problem and this instance shows why...<br>  <br>  Personal responsibility?  Why bother.<br>  <br>  Anyway, give the ride back.  It's not yours and no payment agreement is official.  Go back there (it's not the dealer's fault.for this) and buy something you can afford.  Like a 1996 Exploder.|`|69b28c895ecbe3f5e0fc99326c84d73faa	Take the car back and go somewhere else and buy a car from another dealer. Don't let them talk you into getting a co-signer either.

This is what happens when the dealer deliveres a vehicle before the bank approved the deal. The bank loans the mney not the dealership. If a bank doesn't give a finance approval then the car is not yours and you have to bring it back. there is no rule that states they have to get your financing though, if you can get it yourself then you get to keep the vehicle, see what you can do yourself.|`|55a7c9ee13be4af0516d03c798a92a60aa	yep they do it every day they let you have a car before you get a loan which you should have known you couldnt get one before doing it.. so now you lost your down payment and have to return car as well dont let them talk you into a larger payment to get it just walk away and save up again maybe buy a cheaper car from another place that one does bad business|`|P9oP8CS9aa	Was the sale based on getting the car loan through the seller.

You don't think they tried to find financing or something? No, it is your weak credit history that caused this, which is obvious because now you need a co-signer. People with good credit don't need a co-signer.<br>  <br>  "Should i give the car back..."<br>  <br>  Why are you even questioning it? Of course you should give it back.  The car doesn't belong to you - you have no right to keep it. Without financing, there is no sale. Do you think if you don't give it back they are just going to let you keep it?|`|0TiCSGKtaa	don't return the car until you have every penny you gave them when the contract was signed this happens all the time dlrshp release the cars hoping they will find a bank to finance when they don't they have to get the car back just make sure you get all your money back before you give them the car back if you gave cash make sure you get cash.

I believe you are relying too much on those "reports"  In the end, they mean little, as you have found out.   Here in the USA  if .a title is not furnished, then one can never own the car.  If things are the same there, I would guess that the guy you bought the car from never had a title for it either.  Sounds as if the guy he bought it from  still owes money on it..

I have one of these units mounted on a diesel school bus and it can be set by dashboard control to come on for up to two hours before I startup in the morning and utilizes a 7 day timer with 3 presets.<br>   The unit is manufactured by Webasto and will warm a 6.7 litre 6-cylinder CUMMINS diesel up to about 1/2 to 2/3 of its normal operating range at temperatures as low as -45F.|`|iVNJpQrbaa	I have looked at the GSM-AUTO at <a href="http://www.gsm-auto.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.gsm-auto.com</a> and it is more than a timer, it is in fact a programmable timer switch  that can be activated by calling it from a cell phone, when you call the GSM-AUTO cell phone number it rejects the incomming call (so no call cost) and switches on 1 or 2 relays for a pre-determined length of time, the relays can be used to switch on (or off) anything including engine pre-heaters, cabin heaters, aviation engine heaters, RV heaters in fact almost anything.<br>  Hope this helps

You will be fine.|`|b2444f35a7f9696e20acbb1687b47466aa	Rule of thumb (but everybody is a little different): <br>  <br>  One beer, or one shot, or one glass of wine - wait one hour to drive. <br>  Two beers, or two shots, or two glasses - wait two hours. <br>  And so on, and so on - you get the idea, right?<br>  ======================================...|`|XJqHuHLiaa	not in that 96 clio of yours|`|FUZzB1JWaa	\yeh just go for it|`|cTJa8FZYaa	yes wow|`|J6AAbZbHaa	Yeah it takes about 1 hour per unit for most people to get rid of the alcohol in your body.<br>  <br>  However, don't forget that it does take one hour before your body starts processing it - so ADD AN HOUR ON AS WELL<br>  <br>  The morning after is something that lots of people overlook. We worked out that a guy who goes out friday, saturday nights and a quickie in the pub on sunday lunch, would not be allowed to drive until about late Wednesday. That was assuming around 40 units on fri and 40 on sat, which is a very common thing even though it sounds a lot. One pint of Stella is 3 units in itself, I always over-estimate things just to be sure.|`|G5R8B0Wpaa	The alcohol has mostly dissipated through your system by now,  and you should be OK.    <br>  <br>  A Clio!    Come on now!   Get a real car!    (LOL)|`|oRuGgrMHaa	half a bottle is fine. i think its a unit an hour to leave your system so depend what time it was when you had it.|`|XLXncQu9aa	The key words are "last night".  The issue is the length of time it takes for alcohol to run through your system.  Half a bottle of wine won't affect your driving skills today especially if you had it last night.  I'd be concerned if you were going to drive directly after drinking that much, but in this case, its fine to drive.  If you aren't experiencing any hang over's from heavy drinking then you have nothing to worry about.

BGPa2DqYaa	They will only question or ask for your receipt IF your not on there COMPUTER system when you go and ask for your road test or some such request. Everything will be on the system.

i1ayj8enaa	First, make sure that the cone will move freely in the basket. Then get a multimeter and set it to ohms. measure the resistance of each voice coil. you should get somewhere between 3 and 4 ohms per coil. If you get reading of 0 of over limit, on either one, you've got a blown coil. If that's the case, try to get your money back.
9ee6572e98b952a4bf68a1e6e6c2b500aa	If you are willing to spend some money on it then I would suggest the Alpine PDX-1.1000.

HFrsH9MRaa	The Focus has an engine designed for Ford by Porsche. It is a good design, and fuel efficient. But, the Ford body is NO match for the strength of steel and materials used in the Bimmer. The BMW was designed to drive all day long at 150MPH + and not get tired or worn. The Focus was designed to do all right at speeds of 85-90. There is more technology in the BMW that is 10 years old, than in the Focus that is 3 years old. Gas mileage is probably better in the Ford. Paint job of BMW is light years better. I would leave them BOTH for a good used Audi. Audi is made from even better materials, has a better warranty, is turbo-charged, has BOSE stereo, has quattro AWD. Has REAL heated leather seats all around. a 2001 or 2002 Audi Allroad can be had from the internet for around $10,000. It has heated steering wheel, door locks, parktronic, and best crash tests on the market. Which would you REALLY rather have???|`|mKVFIklaaa	He is absolutely right.

8oG11Mq4aa	My family has owned both and honestly I find BMW's much more pleasurable to drive.  The suspension, steering, engine everything handles the road better than a Benz.  NOW, the AMG Mercedes are very, very nice but they do not compare to any M engine. <br>  <br>  It really comes down to preference. Mercedes quality has really dropped in recent years compared to how they used to be. <br>  <br>  I think overall BMW's are prettier, their engines sound better, they for a fact, are more fun to drive and handle steering power better. <br>  <br>  This is an issue that will never be resolved ... but my saying is, Once you go Bimmer you don't go back.  I've heard countless Mercedes owners switch to BMW's and cannot believe how much MORE fun they're to drive.|`|gOQ5mZ7Xaa	No. Simple as that. Mercedes-Benz is an entirely different league to BMW. Much more outlandishly priced, much more diverse market, better build quality, more luxury, etc. etc. And to those who say BMW is "more of a driver's car", Merc's CLS63 looks very sexy and has twice the luxury but it still goes 300kmph without the limiter. My mum also took a C55 AMG and an SLK 320 for a night each from the dealership she worked at and even the 320 went like the clappers. Obviously the C55 sounded better though. BMW is more along the lines of Audi, and I'd also rather an Audi than a Beemer.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Brooke M, how old are you and what AMG Mercedes did your family supposedly own? Or is it just that you believe every Mercedes-Benz is an AMG? AMG's engines kick seven shades of s*** out of the M-Division engines, in sound, responsiveness, power, torque, practically everything. Yes, the 500hp V10s in the M5 and M6 are brilliant engines but they don't compare to the glorious noise of a 6.3 liter V8 or a 6.5 liter V12. You have no clue. I'm sorry.|`|86692840fce86f8a24dea58512123d09aa	Lol, that is the constant duel between me and my mom. <br>  <br>  I prefer Benz where she likes BMW. <br>  <br>  Having lived in Germany for 20 years my mom says that in Germany BMWs are sportier and for a younger crowd where as Mercedes are for an older/classier crowd. She prefers the sportieness of her BMW while I love the class of my Mercedes Benz!|`|QeMiIL15aa	I've driven both and I personally prefer the benz, it is overall a much nicer driving experience|`|I0g24Jmkaa	I'll take a Beemer over a Benz anyday. (no hate)|`|bXkvtg7maa	Yessss|`|XixWPZZsaa	BMW is not better then Benz and Benz is not better than BMW. They are cars for two different types of drivers.<br>  <br>  BMW's are made for a more robust connection to the road. Suspension is always stiffer, even on not too sporty models. The steering is more precise and tends to have more oversteer than on most Benz's. <br>  <br>  BMW's are suited for high revving conditions, the driver will need to use higher RPM ranges to get the best out of all gears. Merc's rely mostly on their low end torque, the driver will mostly use lower RPM ranges so it adds to the luxury of the ride.<br>  <br>  But I have one answer to any person that would ask me this question - Merc is your car, not the BMW, because it shows that you are not a savvy driver that BMW's are designed for and if you buy one you will never use the car's intended potential in the mode that a Merc would be better driven.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I personally like driving a BMW much better than a Mercedes.  I had a 528  & a Roadster when they first came out while I lived in Germany and it was so sporty & fun to drive.

If you want a car that has a focus more on luxury, you want a Mercedes. If you want more of a performance car, BMW is the right car for you.|`|vV9qPn16aa	well it depends on what you like. i prefer bmw on a man,its much much more masculine. mercedes is feminine.|`|ukX8PPyPaa	Yes, if you want a long lasting and a good driver's car buy a BMW, with the Mercedes you are practically paying for the badge only.|`|5QNwcjfEaa	nope, Benz>Beemer.<br>  <br>  BMWs, while nice, aren't nearly as classy as a Benz.|`|ABMvstsaaa	Nothing beats a classy mercedes;)

I mean I can see not bothering the police, but still next time if they admit they are at fault just get them to sign something saying that, and sign it as well and then get their insurance info. Gives you something if you need it. My mother was hit from behind once, knew the car was damaged(it was kinda bad) but didn't know how bad it was. The car was considered totaled when the Insurance Company saw it and they were saying it wasn't safe to drive. What wasn't noticed was underneath part of it was like dripping on the exhaust and could have caught fire.|`|ae530cfc7c3f9fd6506b72dc76a8d126aa	NO - you have broken the law.<br>  <br>  You are required to exchange details with the other driver. Failure to do so invalidates your insurance, so you are technically un-insured at that point, which is illegal.<br>  <br>  More important, you "bashed your head". That is an injury. In the event of an injury, you must either call the Police or report it to the Police within 24 hours. Not to do so is a criminal offence (Failing to report an accident). If the other driver goes to the Police and you don't you face a fine and three penalty points. If the other driver also tells the Police that you "just drove off" without exchanging details, then you could also be charged with the more serious offence of "Leaving the scene of an accident". Depending upon your existing driving record, this latter charge could see you losing your licence.|`|WaI693jHaa	No. ALWAYS swap insurance details and if possible take a photo or two.<br>  You may find a scratch or something may be bent, and what if you all of a sudden have headaches or something.

AA10419188	More Shakespeare:   Ti's a far a far better thing you may do!... By fixing this car!<br>  <br>  Sounds as though you want a "new appearing car"!  Guaranteed you will not pick up one for $2000 difference! -- Or may be even $4000 for that matter!  True you may find a car with a little better mileage, but if you end up in  a "head on collision", will you survive?  I have seen wrecks between small cars like Pris, Focus, "smart cars", -- if they hit something like suv, pickup,- 20 year old standard cars, -- they are "toast", and invariably lose the match!<br>  <br>  Best of all so far you haven't bought into mentality that a "new" car is the only "good car" around!  And obviously you don't hate the car so far!<br>  <br>  Look at it this way, if you fix it up and take care of it and drive another 10 years, - it wil be an "antique" (or at least a classic) car!<br>  You may be able to sell it then for as much as it cost when new!<br>  <br>  I have a 1922 Model T Ford that is now over 85 years old.  It cost $595 when new, -- since it is only in "fair shape", but still looks nice on outside, - and it drives ok, - even though the interior is in sad condition, -- it is still worth about $10K.  I over payed when I bought it in 1976, -- paid $1900 for it!|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	When ever I think about replacing a car, I look at how much I will have to pay in taxes and check how much more insurance will cost. Most of the time this is enough to talk me into just fixing the old one up.<br>  As for getting your money back on the investment of fixing the old one up, when has any one got their money back on any car? There are few examples of this. So no matter which route you take it is a money loosing proposition.|`|Ty32khkaaa	Dents are easy, just do those yourself, or get a body shop to do them. If you do them yourself try not to build the body filler "Bondo" more then 1/4 inch thick after it is sanded. Do not use "Bondo" brand body filler, Evercoat makes a filler thet is much better and about 1/2 the price. You can get that at any auto paint supplier. Anyways, a gallon of body filler, 10 strips of sand paper, and a sanding block should do it. Don't forget to get some primer. If you can get access to an air compressor, use it and stay away from spray can primer, that stuff will fall off the car even if you paint over it. <br>  <br>  There are 2 ways that you can tackle the head rest problem, there are leather kits on ebay for like $250, I did it on my trail blaser and it turned out nice. The kit does the whole vehicle front and back. The other thing you can do is cover them with a seat cover for a lot cheaper. <br>  <br>  I saw a slightly used flowmaster muffler on ebay for $40 "buy it now". You can clamp that on and do it yourself. Shocks I would get new, they are inexpensive and are not good to get used. <br>  <br>  The dash is a thing that just happens. I have seen some cool remedies for them though. I have seen people lay fleece over them and then use fibergalss resin to mold it. It is a lot of work, but if it is done right it is nice. You could also just go with a dash cover. They do a good job of hiding the cracks to some extent. <br>  <br>  I would keep it, that is what I am doing with my 1996 Ram. I also think you can get it done for under $2,000. If you get it painted be sure to use urethane paint. It will last twice as long.|`|sbWz5qyRaa	I also have the same car and the only major repair I've had to do was repair a blown head gasket.  I've also done minor repairs, shocks, struts, starter solenoid, hoses, etc.  I've got 140 k on it and I only use it for short trips.  If your looking for a dependable car I would consider purchasing a newer vehicle that has been well maintained, as with everything, the older it gets the more maintenance it's going to require and nickle dime you to death.  You may consider purchasing a new car and with the way the economy is now there are some really good deals as long as you don't get sucked in with all the other stuff the dealer will offer.

xQPH5JFgaa	The "rev" between 1st and 2nd is commonly called a flair.  This could be indicative of internal clutches slipping.  However, the Neon uses a kickdown cable.  On top of the trans, there are 2 linkages.  1 is the gear selector.  The other (attached to a shaft that runs through the selector shaft) is the kickdown.  Chances are that is sticking.  Free it up with some rust penetrant and drive it.  This should help.  The reason this occurs is because the trans is thinking you are at WOT all the time, so it won't shift (tries to use the most available power).

AXNkmdbKaa	It depends what year cutlass supreme.  They are just a Chevelle with Olds badges so a set of frame brackets (which bolt on) and chevy motor mounts with a chevy engine and chevy exhaust will do it.   I would recommend a 454 for the fun of it.  If you have a fit-all trans, you don't even have to change the trans.  Look to see if some of the bell housing bolts are un-used, if so it is a fit-all.|`|8AQw9xqBaa	It depends on whats year and whats in there now.   I dont think the cutlass ever came with a chevy motor but it was the same basic body as other GM's that did. 78? to 87 it was a "G" body.   The Monte Carlos almost always had chev motors in them.   Later Grand Prix had the the Chev 305 as a v8 option, earlier ones were pontiac 301's.   Regals tended to have the buick 231/3.8 v6's, even with a turbo option most years.  Later regals had a v8 option that was the olds 307.  To put in a chev 350 you will ideally find a Monte or GP to donate you all the parts you need.  If you cant find one you will have to order all those parts which may or may not still be possible.  Getting the motor to bolt in is the easy part except for the transmission, chev is/ was the oddball.  Buick, Olds, Pontiac, and Cadillac all used the same bell housing since the late 60's.  Its the little things that are a huge pain like the fuel lines coming up the wrong side and wire harness not being quite long enough. If your car now has a 260 (late 70's)or 307(early 80's-87) olds finding another olds motor (350 or 403) will make things much easier because at least all the physical stuff is about the same.  If you have the Buick 231/3.8V6  there are no other direct bolt ins so it gets more complicated because you need to change all the mounts and everything. Also in most if not all states in the USA this would likely not be a legal swap so be sure to make sure thats not going to be an issue.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	it would depend on what year it is.they came out with a 350 rocket up until the 1980 something. if it came out with a v-6 there will not be very much room under the hood, around the motor and also the rad. will be to small.

MUNO6Btfaa	I don't want to insult your intelligence, so please bear with me if I  mention something you already know. First, for quality assurance purposes you should make sure that the desired torque falls between 20 and 90 percent of the wrenches' rated torque value. As someone already commented, some TR's will click when arriving at the desired torque. Other TR's will "break", but they don't spin freely. They simply "give" a little bit. Torquing to 20 ft/lbs. does not require a whole lot of gorilla muscle, so could it be that it is too difficult to differentiate between the force required and the "break" of the wrench? That may be the case if you are working with a TR rated at, say, 100 ft/lbs. or more. I hope this helps.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you should get 1 of those clicking type and when you set it to where you want it then it will click when it gets to the pounds that you set it at.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	"20 ft lbs per inch" is kind of mixing up the terms. It's either an "inch-pound" wrench or a "foot-pound" wrench. <br>  You are correct, 20 ft lbs is not a whole lot of torque for most applications. The torque wrenches with a guage read out or a dial with a pointer read only what the guage indicates and do not "click" or indicate a specific torque other than what you read on the guage.<br>  The twist setting torque wrenches general snap over center with an audible click when the set torque is reached.<br>  No torque wrench will spin free- this would be brutal on the knuckles :-)|`|xYV9Z5K6aa	Both of my Torque wrenches click when you reach the proper torque but do not spin freely after the click.|`|0b17535ea0a24e5ccc0511e0b29b8602aa	It should simply "click".<br>  That's all.|`|aafTqjV1aa	First off, congratulations on starting the use of torque wrenches. You just moved up about 10 notches in mechanical skill over people who don't use them.<br>  I suspect the problem you are having is you are running into "drag torque" This is the amount of force you need to turn the nut or bolt to start will. You need to add the "Drag Torque" to the required torque to get the target value. Because the torque value you are requiring is so low, I think you are already over the 20 ft/lbs just turning the fastener. <br>  What you can do is back the nut or bolt off so you have definite clearance. Then increase the setting on your torque wrench gradually, until the fastener turns without "'Clicking" the wrench. This is your drag torque value. Say it is 26 ft.lbs. So you just add the value you need<br>  (20 ft.lbs.) to the drag torque (26 ft.lbs.) and you come up with  46 ft.lbs. So to actually apply 20 ft.lbs. of torque, you need to set the wrench for 46 ft.lbs. and then tighten the fastener until it clicks.  Do it 3 times on each fastener. (That is, move the wrench in the tightening direction, get a click, bring the torque up again until it clicks again, and then do it one more time.) You DON'T move the fastener backwards between these. Just apply force, get the click, release the force, apply the force again, get a click, and then release the force and apply it one more time. It may move a little as you come up each time. This is OK. After the 3rd time, the fastener should be good  to go.<br>  This may seem like a pain in the *ss at first, but soon it will be second nature. I learned about torque wrenches when I first learned to be an airplane mechanic, and we use them all the time. I have a big selection of my own torque wrenches, and get them calibrated on a regular basis so I know they are accurate. I have to admit they are not so critical for cars, but if you are doing engine work, or putting wheels on, they are invaluable.  By using torque you will find you have fewer fastener failures, your gaskets will seal better, because you are putting the clamp load on them that the engineers calculated they would need, etc. It is just good mechanical practice to use them. Once again I congratulate you on improving your skills and capabilities!

nAzbLdBCaa	Without question the outboard motor is the most important part of the boat.  I've never seen an outboard worn out...........I've seen them neglected to an early failure.  The key to long life is oil in the fuel and water pump replacement on regular basis, and if your not going to use the motor for say 3 months, preform a storage procedure......sooner-than-later.   Run the fuel out of the engine every time you are finished for that trip.   Keep fresh clean fuel in the eng.  Keep the boat in covered storage if possible.  Read everything you can about boating and engine maintenancee.   I know several old engines that are still running that I admired in the 1950's    Just one more tip.......condensation and lack of lubrication in the rod/crankshaft area is often not understood.   You have to spray "fogging oil" in while the engine is warmed up and running.   Replace the water pump impeller not less that every 2 years, or if you run it out of water for more than a few seconds.  Good Luck!|`|iTj5NdH1aa	Simply take care of your engine. It will not last forever and your engine will get to a point where it is no longer worth spending money on, but good maintenance of your outboard will certainly increase the life of it.<br>  <br>  You typically see engine failure due to the owner neglecting it. They don't service their engine, don't winterize it, they get lazy, and then they pay for it.<br>  <br>  No outboard engine is going to last forever. Eventually, it WILL fail on you. But maintaining your engine well will get you to that point when you realize your engine is getting tired, and its time for a new one.|`|AA10714678	Indifferent maintenance. Follow the owners manuel and perform periodic maint religiously and you will avoid most problems. Buy good equipment ie Mercury, Yamaha or Honda. Little things may go wrong but that is the nature of anything mechanical. If you plan to go out of sight of land...2 motors, you'll always have one to get home on. Also buy a good VHF and a MF/HF radio and at least an EPIRB.|`|EooU3QGnaa	Some engine s do appear to last forever. I've worked on the "Lentini collection" and have found a surprising number of engines from 1912 thru the 20's and 30's that just required a little service to have them running as good as they ever did. (which in some cases wasn't all that great)<br>  As reported, they almost never wear out. You get the water in the crankcase, and bad things happen. You hit an underwater obstruction-you can guess the rest, You loan it out and it never comes back-forget to chain it to the boat or use bolts.<br>  <br>  The best deal in outboards is to get several obsolete engines of the same model and keep two in the garage for spares. The big chryslers come to mind. They ran good, now you can advertise for one and find 3 "orphans" abandoned at your door.<br>  <br>  So- just "redneck" yourself into a good boat and have some cheap throwaway motors- or go get a loan and put a 10K new motor on your boat.|`|cAMdBtFQaa	Dale<br>  <br>  It is like anything else, do your maintenance.  Cars last forever because their owner takes care of them.  I typically get 2 to 300K or better out of my vehicles, but I am out there changing oil every 3 to 5 K and greasing what is supposed to be greased, checking my bearings and replacing my brakes.  I treat my boat and motor the same way.<br>  My last boat I called "The Duck Boat" it was a 16 ft john boat, the motor was a 1967 Chrysler 55 horse and it did not have an easy life with all the mud and cattails I put it through.  It did on occasion over the years leave me paddling in.  Once a bug in the fuel line got me, once was a plastic bag wrapped around and sucked into the water inlet, once was seeds off a tree floating in the water got sucked in and once was a thermostat which stuck.  Point is if that motor stops pissing water, turn it off, clear the problem.  If you can't, row or use your tolling motor to get back in, if you run it even a little bit you are warping the head.  I have always bought the factory manuals for everything I have ever owned, granted its expensive, but I have always found it worth while, nobody will take as good a care of my stuff as I will and I always take the time to do it right, I don't settle for good enough unless I have to and as soon as I get the chance, it is fixed right.  Pull your prop off often and check for fishing line on the shaft, it will ruin your foot seals real quick.  If you see an oil stain, track it down.<br>  Also, pay attention to the rest of the guys that responded, all good advice on keeping your motor and boat alive and out of big dollar repairs.  My old boat got sold to my Mailman, he and his wife are still using it.  Problem with the old one, it was getting hard to find seals and stuff anymore, but its still working and it starts first time every time.  I sold it last year.  My new motor ran $13,000, the whole package ran better than 30, plus the manuals, I also got the program to read the codes from my lap top.  Is it worth the bucks, I think so, I have all the specs on the engine and components and can read the codes, I can use a multimeter and I know what it means.  I have added a network so I can monitor nearly all the functions from the console and I have one gauge dedicated to my water pressure and temperature and I watch it when the motor is running.  You don't have to go everywhere at full throttle, you don't drive your car that way and you will get better mileage for it.  Even with all of this, I know parts can break, and electronics can fail, but my chances of needing a new power head are less than if I did not do this.  Electrical additions to a boat require a little more attention.  I always apply a light coating of no-ox, keeps the corrosion down and I tape or shrink tube everything I install.  If the course holds true with this new one, my kids will be squabbling over who gets the boat, I do not think I will get 40 more years out of me but the boat should.  <br>  Few problems are the result of taking responsibility for your stuff, and performing maintenance and repairs properly and when required, it is not luck.|`|yIABHlldaa	I never understood the attraction to outboards. They are outrageously expensive to buy and repair.<br>  <br>  Nothing lasts forever. Like anything, you get rid of it when the repairs and loss of use out weigh the price of a new.<br>  <br>  I would not consider a used outboard. If its for sale, its for sale for a reason. <br>  <br>  Trouble free boating is possible. I ran my last boat for 16 years without a single breakdown. Its all in your philosophy. My belief is the whole boating package (ever thing from storage, payments,maintenance to bait and tackle), is big $$$. I do not want to be stuck at the dock for any reason.  <br>  <br>  Here's how: Every part of your boat has a lifespan. During the winter months, I eyeball everything and anything that is warn, tired or at the end of it's life is replaced.<br>  <br>  Example: an alternator for my boat is $60. I don't wait for the battery to go dead before replacing it. If it's 5yrs old, it gone.

(something is broken inside the engine)|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be a couple of things. you said you have gas but is it reaching the engine? it could be the gas filter clogged up or the fuel pump went to lunch, so to speak. i would be changing the gas filter and check the pump fuse before dropping the tank.if the pump is bad then it,s not the question how much the pump will cost but how much they will charge you for putting it in. labor is,nt cheap these days. you would be better off to take it to 1 of those small time garages where they don,t charge you a arm and leg.|`|AA11914369	Spray a *little* starter fluid in the intake, and see if it starts.  If not it would be a spark problem probably, if so it may indeed be fuel, but before you assume it's the pump, how long has it been since you changed the filter?<br>  <br>  Stand at the rear of the car, near the filler, and have dad turn the key on, but not to start.  Do you hear the fuel pump running?  If not open the hood, and find the box that has relays and fuses.  Are the fuses all good?  If so swap out the relay for the fuel pump.  Chances are there is another identical one in the box, perhaps for the brake lights or A/C.  If it does run, it could be the filter, if it's been a while I'd change it anyway.<br>  <br>  If that solved the problem, you know what to do.  If not, get a RUBBER hammer and beat on the bottom of the fuel tank, and try again.  If it starts, it's definitely the fuel pump, but you've just saved the cost of a tow.  Drive it to your mechanic, or the dealer.  Since the fuel pump is in the tank, which must be removed and yours is full, it's labor intensive and the parts are not cheap.  You could be looking at up to $500, so ask for an estimate.  Good luck, hope it's something simple like the filter.|`|SY9hPeROaa	Trun on  and listen  do you hear a buz for 30 sec .

XrZbqY4Vaa	To answer your first question.  If the indicators do not work and the indicator light stays on when you use them then the problem can only lie in one of two places.  Firstly, the indicator relay could be faulty.  Easy to replace and not very expensive, alternatively, it could be a blown fuse or a fuse making a bad contact.  The beetle indicator relay is wired (in my mind) strangely with two live (power) wires both from separate fuses feeding the relay.  Hence, if one fuse is blown, either the indicator light in the car stays on and the indicators don't work, or the indicators work with the indicator light in the speedo remaining off.<br>  <br>  Your second question.  This is probably due to poor/worn contacts.  Is it the switch on the light or the switch that is fitted to the door (i.e. when you open the door interior light comes on).  If it is the switch, best to disassemble it and give it a good cleaning.  This will not help much if it worn.  Only solution in this case is to replace.<br>  <br>  Your choke problem.  Little bit difficult to give exact cause.  However, I would check to see that nothing is catching (i.e. the movement of the choke is smooth.  I would also recommend hat you purchase a carburettor kit (the bottom end of the range one which includes a new choke element).  With a car this age, I would definitely do this.  My experience on opening up these electric chokes is that once they get old - replace.  Cleaning up, when it works only seems to be a  short term solution.  Whilst I do not think it is the problem, check the wire that connects to the choke.  It runs from the coil.  If it is looking a bit 'tatty' (insulation broken etc) replace it,  These engine runs hot and consequently this wire does suffer over time. <br>  <br>  Hope you come right and let us know what you found wrong.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, as a beetle owner, I would strongly recommend that you become a regular visitor to the Samba site.  URL is as follows<br>  <a href="http://www.thesamba.com/vw/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thesamba.com/vw/</a>|`|EmgiGg17aa	First off it is a 73.  Find a 1973 penny and see what color the copper is.  Pretty black, right(compared to a new penny)   If you took a pencil eraser and erased the black penny it would become shiny again(as you erase of the oxidation a.k.a. rust)   The oxidation does not conduct electricity as well as the shiny clean metal.<br>     Your electrical connections are either brass or alunimum(both of these "oxidize" over time) giving you no connection.<br>    That is the chemistry/physics of it.<br>    To get a good connection means cleaning the contacting surfaces ( I use a piece of fine sandpaper, or the edge of a pocket knife to scrape off the oxides so that shiny metal is there again.   This also applies to the light bulbs which for the most part are brass with a lead tip.  Now lead is very soft and usually turns a dull grey over time.   But because it is so soft, I just wipe the tip on my jeans and that shines it up to silvery color.  The brass is either brassy or it is dirty like the penny, or greenish(meaning water is getting in from a leaking seal or cracked lens) which also can be cleaned up  with sandpaper (150-220 grit) .  Now the light bulb socket needs attention too and make sure that is cleanish on the sides and the ends at the bottom.  Sandpaper folded over the end of a flat blade screwdriver will help you get into the hole to sand the tang at the bottom.  Sandpaer rolled around a pencil will help you do the sides of the socket.   That should be good.   I mean you can buy a new bulb instead of cleaning a perfectly good dirty one(but as I am usually doing this sort of thing at night or on a Sunday, stores are not open....so really; which is faster?       Also, I know you thougt that was everything, take out the ceramic fuse and look at its ends.  That fuse uses a zinc strip and it too oxidizes (blame the oxygen you breathe).  that may need a bit of cleaning too with a very a very light touch with fine sandpaper (50% clean is good enough).  Also the place where the fuse goes in has brass tangs.  You got the sandpaper on your finger tip, might as well give it a quick swipe as well.<br>  <br>  This cleaning applies to power wires  as well as to ground wires(brown and black)  With the signal lite holding :   you could have a ground problem too.  One wire sends out the power(+) and the other receives it and takes it home(-) or to ground(back to the battery.).<br>  <br>  The interior light, if you are talking about the switch on the light itself, it is probably easier to find another one at a salvage yard or buy another one completely then tinker with it but the cleaning is the same as for the other electrical as that unit will pop out if you use your finger nails under the opposite end of the switch and lever it out.  Undo the wires and clean it on the kitchen table( I do all my work and fiddling there) I guess cause I can get a coffee too.  Does not matter which wire goes where when you reconnect.<br>  <br>  Now automatic choke.   There is a black wire(most times a duo of black wires) on the side of it connected to a tang.  Clean the electrical tang.(though that is not the problem here, while the electrical thing is in your head, do it)<br>    Now that tang is connected to a circular disk which is behind a triangle(which is held in place by 3 screws).    Behind the circular disk is the autochoke spring,   You don't have to go there.  I am just telling you what it is.<br>     The best way to work on this, is to remove the aircleaner from the carburator.  Undo the clamp  on the underside of the aircleaner and disconnect the thin vacuum hoses and lift the aircleaner straight up and hold it as it sat in the car and find a place to set it down so it remains in that position(because it has oil in it, any you do not want a mess, which you will get when you tip it on its side and the oil pours out.<br>       Okay.  Now go back to that triangle and loosen the 3 screws about a turn.  The triangle is just a clamp that holds the disc in place.  With the screws loosened you will be able to turn the circle.     If you look on the edge of the circle you will see a line cut into the casting that is the circle and corresponding bumps on the other side.  Rotate the circle to the upper bump (or if you are already past that point rotate another 1/8" farther than where it is presently sitting and tighten the screws that hold the triangle clamp.   You have just set the choke a little stronger so it will set(which it was not doing.)<br>     There is a few reasons for it not setting.  The carb outsides is really grungy(you can see major oily dustbunnies) that would hinder the operation on the opposite side where the linkages are, a hose or wire is getting in the way or the aircleaner was rubbing against the linkage(happens especially if it is not the stock oil bath aircleaner)....and thirdy if the choke spring has gotten weak.   If it is not free to move then it does not matter the strength of the spring.<br>     So once you done that, put the air cleaner back on and clamp it do|`|AawNVRAsaa	the back side of your dash board is getting wet in the trunk. <br>  <br>  If it is below 50* and humid where you are, you may have carb icing.

sCqdisvnaa	It's not like a new car where there's a known and defined value to the vehicle.  A CPO car is a used car with a warranty.  The price of the used car is a lot more variable than that of a new car.<br>  <br>  In the end, though, it comes down to whether the dealership will do it.  At the end of the day, it's all about money.  If dealer A, with the car, thinks they can sell it for good dollars, they're not going to want to let it go to another dealer.  On the other hand, if dealer B wants to sell you the car, and they (and you) are prepared to pay enough money, then they can work something out.<br>  <br>  The long and the short of it is it'll be cheaper and simpler to buy it where it's for sale.

XQvWjkrSaa	If you are talking about minor swirls (not really scratches) then your answer is yes.  I good paste wax will probably fill or at least reduce the appearance of the swirls marks.  But if the scratch is something that is deep enough to where you can feel it (finger nail test), then you should look to use a polish to level out the scratch.|`|lmSoNMhPaa	no it will not. go to walmart, or oreillys  and they have touch up kits.|`|I0mP1xssaa	Are they deep enough to be showing the primer or metal?  Then you will need to use touch up paint.  Don't just buy any touch up paint though-while you might think black is black, it actually does vary in shade by manufacturer and you might end up making them more visable if you use the wrong shade.  Auto parts stores sell touch up paint that is color matched to your car-try Advance, Autozone, O'Reilly's, etc.  Usually they will have a book or chart with the paint, but you can ask at the counter for more help.  You will need to completely clean the area you are applying the paint to for it to adhere properly.  Wax, dirt or other material will cause the newly applied touch up to crack, peel or just come back off.  Check with the parts store for their recommendation, or look for a paint prep product that is paint safe (some things, like Acetone, are used to prep bare metal for paint, but will also effect existing paint).<br>  <br>  If they are just light scratches in the clear coat (you can't see another color below them), then you can "fill" them.  Try Meguiar's Scratch X or similar product.  Again, the auto parts stores in your area should carry it and can help direct you.  If you are looking to really detail the car, check here for a nice write up on the whole process from start to finish: <a href="http://www.squidoo.com/showcardetailing" rel="nofollow">http://www.squidoo.com/showcardetailing</a>|`|AA10419188	Touch up paint might work, but be sure that the scratches are cleaned out very well, -- if filled with wax, the paint may chip and peel!  Also unless you apply it very carefully, it may look worse than the scratch (as it will draw more attention)!  Try filling crack with color crayon -- just try it somewhere less obvious, when you apply polish, it should clean off all extra but leave scratch filled (apply crayon, and polish at right angles to scratches)!  If this looks satisfactory to you , - then go ahead and fill all the scratches that way!<br>  <br>  Yes if you can find a wax with black pigment in it - it may help! Best thing about black - is that it only comes in one "color tint"!<br>  <br>  By the way if you have smooth wood paneling in house,- crayons with matching colors do a great job of hiding blemishes, nail holes, scratches, etc!|`|Ty32khkaaa	No, but you can get a touch up kit cheap at any auto part store.

cAMdBtFQaa	I had a 16 ft Jon boat with a 1967 55 horse Chrysler on it and my Toyota pulled it great for years, until the truck retirement at 247K, I gave it to my dad, he needed a farm truck.  The 22R engine is probably the best 4 banger I have ever seen as long as you do your maintenance.  The next truck was a toy 22R engine again, but 4 wheel drive.  Also did great pulling the boat, gave it to my dad at 287K.  The new one is 6 cyl and 4 wheel drive.  Unless the trailer hits something I don't even know its back there.  I do like the 4 wheel drive, I can launch my boat even when ice is on the ramp.  That old boat survived 5 vehicles total, I got a new boat last year, the package comes in right at 4500 lbs when all loaded up and it drags a lot of air.  The 6 cyl Tacoma still hustles right along with it I am only at 178K on this one so it will be around for a few years yet.<br>  That has been my experience, hope it helps with your decision.  Just as a side note, I live in Colorado, we have hills here and some pretty fair winds.   In a 60, 70 mph head wind, I do loose some speed and have to run in 4th. going up hill and head wind, I may have to go to 3rd.  Never had that problem with the old boat.|`|OtDPZO3vaa	A 16 ft aluminum boat with 40 horses doesn't weigh much at all. The trailer to carry it weighs next to nothing, too. The 4 cyl. will easily tow it. The thing you need to pay attention to is the capabilities of the bumper. The heavier duty the truck, the heavier the bumper. I'm guessing the boat, motor and trailer will be less than 1,200 pounds.<br>  Will the bumper support that? Does the bumper or frame of the truck have a place for the safety chains to mount (for cradling the trailer if it comes off the hitch) ?<br>  Also, the ramps that you'll be using the most...are they clean and undisturbed by tides? The reason I ask is because if you are going to use this on a ramp that loses water at low tide, it exposes the algae that grows on the ramp and that gets very slick. 2-Wheel drive, if it slips on the ramp, can be really funny...er, I mean dangerous, because it can let you slip down the ramp, or into the walls of the ramp and that could ruin a day of fishing in a hurry!|`|3YiZ63OVaa	Its the weight of the boat that matters more then the size.  I'm guessing your boat is less then  2K.

213f725a793437432aac3cd6e080d27caa	If they don't want your trade, then just give them back the car you purchased. They can not make you pay the $1,000 if you have a signed contract stating all the figures including the trade. If the lender rejects a loan, which in this case sounds almost like a buy here, pay here lot, the deal is void. It will not be a repo on your report if they are the ones backing out of the deal. Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|3MTYGEbWaa	If you bought from a scumbag buy-here-pay-here dealer, he probably inspected your trade in and found it was junk, and now doesn't want to give the money he initially promised you for it, in the contract. These dealers know every trick in the book and will try to make your life miserable. For instance, he could claim one of your payments was late and come repo your car. Then you would have to fight him, take him to Small Claims Court, and still not get your car back. If you feel strongly about it, get a lawyer. Otherwise, give the car back and try to find a car at a legitimate car dealer, or buy from an individual.|`|2932956ec7662d7544675f368775f540aa	Laws vary state to state but I see no way the dealer can do this. When you traded in your old car the dealer (their mechanic likely) looked at the car and the amount given for trade in was estimated, therefore if there is a problem it is the dealers problem not yours. Once a sales contract for a car has been entered into by both parties then that is what it is. I once had a chevrolet dealer try an similar scam on me, whereas I traded in my old car after it was fully looked at and then the dealer called me and tried to back out of the deal but I had a contract, THEN this dealer called me back afew weeks later and ask me to drop by the dealership. I went to see the dealer, who tells me that their accounting office made a mistake and my car payments would be increased, had a NEW contract on his desk for me to sign. I had my original contract in hand, waved it at him and handed him my attorney's card and said " Talk with Him". Never heard another word about it.  Many dealers are simply thieves, pure and simple.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Sounds like the salesman was in a rush to get his commission.<br>  What you have going for you is that contract. As long as the contract states that the car you traded in is listed, then you need to go back and show them that. That salesman was doing bad business. I agree with the answerer above to go back in there and have them discuss the real problem behind it.|`|AA10788612	I'm willing to bet the financing fell through. For whatever reason, he cannot get a lender to pick up the contract. He was in such a hurry to sell a car that he/she failed to secure a loan. Or the car you traded isn't going to get them the $1K they thought it was worth at the auction. But you have a contract. I would waltz on down there & find out what the "real" problem is.

3NoQuoWuaa	Sure you can drive it but if the sticker expired and you get caught expect to get a citation from your friendly police officer.r|`|BGPa2DqYaa	You can drive It AS LONG as your currant inspection sticker is still valid. If It expired say on 2/28/09 your out of luck. Technically, you can not drive it. It's a ticket if your caught. but if It is still valid then you can.|`|ljWMZ67Taa	It depends on what failed the inspection, like if were exhaust, windshield, or broken lens you do need to get that fixed as fast as possible. On the other hand if was burnt out lights you could fix that yourself with the help of a good auto parts store. But in a lot of places you can drive it as long as you are on the way to or from a place of getting it repaired for the re-inspection, and that if you have a up to date temporary tag.|`|a1ddcae78f9848320ad0b8246c9c1087aa	You can drive it until March 31, 2009<br>  <br>  As of April 1, 2009 it either has to be repaired and pass an inspection, or parked until it is repaired.

AA12076385	Yes you do need a license. <br>  <br>  Your learner's permit will allow you to ride any motorcycle, not at night, not on the freeway and no passengers.<br>  <br>  Your M2 is a license for motor driven cycles (Under 149cc)<br>  <br>  Your M1 is a license for all bikes.<br>  <br>  What cali law calls a scooter is a vehicle that has a place for the rider to stand. I don't think this is the type of scooter you are referring to. any license works for this.|`|fl60KL8oaa	You can ride a motorcycle, a motor-driven cycle (under 150cc), a motorized bicycle (mo-ped, has pedals), or a motor scooter (those tiny stand on things).  To legally operate any of them on the street you need a M1 or M2 endorsement on your license.  Make an on-line appointment and visit your local DMV for more information.|`|7DJZgngmaa	it depends on the scooter like you said.<br>  look at it this way, if there are GOOD kids riding them around town, then you shouldn't need a license
EQmBmN42aa	It should be 4-door, 4-cyls, not sporty. I would prefer Honda or Toyota... First time drivers usually have much more expensive car insurance, and it depends from car. You should compare insurance rates while choosing the car - for example here - carinsurance.yoll.net|`|dyIyJqauaa	If all else is equal : driver, location, etc. Older basic cars get the best rate.  The color of a car has Absolutely nothing to do with rates.  That is an old wives tale that won't die.|`|sR4HjV9Paa	A bicycle.<br>  <br>  I laugh at all these teeny cars as I drive by in my huge 1971 Cadillac Fleetwood. If it were any bigger, my car would have its own zip code.|`|s3iruA0raa	4 cylinders and 4 doors.  Also never by a red car.  This was advise from our insurance agent.  Big cars, more power (more cylinders), 2 doors (indicates sports car) and the color red (people mistakingly believe it is a sporty color) all bring you insurance rates up.  Also, take drivers ed and get a certificate for a % off your rate.|`|005a61bba8d9b8803905cdfa72e2bd86aa	Well, it varies by company, but older sedans get the best rates generally. You should call around to insurance companies and get quotes before you buy a car.|`|kqYiyAvLaa	Dull colored sedans. <br>  Bright colors make your insurance higher.<br>  So do sports cars.
3ixmHSwmaa	If it was a little older, you could just hotwire and go, but you have a locking column. <br>  <br>  If the dealer can't help you by a key number, call a locksmith. He/she can "impression" a brass key that you can use to have a new key made.|`|56f7791c16875200e7c89ce0bbaf53cbaa	Look in the mirror and talk to the idiot that never had a spare key made!|`|AfiWZhXeaa	a vehicle that old you could probly get a slim jim in there or just have a locksmith pick it for you. then get some keys from the dealer

2yrEjfmLaa	that is the parts inside the ecm. like the processor can't talk to the memory. you replace the ecm when this happens and does not go away. I would try to pull the battery and see if it comes back.
d9ECb7N8aa	You could get a 350ci in a 3/4-ton truck with a 4L80E... So why not a 454 to a 4L60E??? They do have the same bellhousing bolt pattern.<br>  <br>  The tranny will mate, but you would be better off running the 4L80E because the 60E will have a short life behind the higher torque motor. You can build a 60 to take the abuse though.<br>  <br>  How are you going to control the trans? It is all electronic... You would need a custom tune for the TBI computer to control the transmission, or flash the TBI to think that it is a manual trans truck, then run a stand-alone controller for the tranny.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	What boogie said.<br>  <br>  The 4L60E blows up sitting behind the 4.3L v6.<br>  <br>  You get where I am going with how this will (not) work behind a 454...|`|zOIgzIy4aa	nope ! the 454 is a big block and the 350 is a small block. it won,t bolt up to your tranny.if you are going to use the 454 and you need to use the transmission that came with it.|`|fefea25d32d84e4e20a7a00602d67062aa	Dodge man and bandit haven't got a clue!<br>  It will bolt up perfectly. As long as you can get your ECM to work with the 454 and the 4L60E you will be fine. I agree the 4L80E would be better. I would look into whether or not the ECM from the 60E will work with the 80E though. <br>  Chevy 250 CI all the way to 572 CI have the same bell housing bolt pattern.|`|AA12261615	nope the 4l60 has a small bolt pattern on it ,they wont interchange,you need one for big block transmission,good luck.
s9HY3wRUaa	Ford Mondeo. brilliant handling, looks like a bit like a Jaguar XF what more do you need?|`|ANdXNm6daa	Buy an American car
ANdXNm6daa	Not if it is in writing and you signed it|`|MLMFWV1Qaa	It depends on how charitable the dealer is feeling this morning. By law, he can enforce the contract. Good luck...poor salesman's going to be hating life if the deal unwinds. You ought to at least give him a couple hundred for his trouble...he doesn't like to go through all that stress for practice.|`|c11fee07c98ac2e271f2ab5acd400781aa	Don't these big discussions about costly financial moves take place BEFORE signing on dotted lines?<br>  <br>  Actually, if you have to lose the down payment, be happy if you get away that easily.<br>  <br>  I live in TX, too.  I guarantee you no remorse or cooling off clauses exist.|`|AA11914369	Not likely, and surely not required.  Once you sign a purchase order, the dealer is out some time, money and trouble, and *can* hold you to the deal if they want to.  There is no 'buyers remorse' law in TX or any other state for that matter, that allows you a time period to change your mind.<br>  <br>  So talk to the dealer, and perhaps he will refund part of down.  If not, enjoy your new RV.
kgk3Yz9Naa	they did it with me..they will send a couple of more letter,i just binned them....that was 3 years ago and ive heard nothing.|`|AA11908567	If you paid it off sooner by x date, it would be have been ￡40 as stated on letter.  I think they still say it.|`|5Aw8zfruaa	Chill out. Here's the bad news first. You will have to pay the fine. The good news, don't worry about court, ballifs, prison or CCJ. Write to the DVLA and explain to them your financial situation and that the car is off road. Ask them if you can make a payment plan for the fine. It's much cheaper for them to take that than go through the court. Don't worry you will not go to gaol for it. <br>  <br>  send me a message if you need more help|`|FfIgXc7aaa	If you write to them saying that your car is and was off the road at the time and that you have lost your job and dont have the money, they often let people off.<br>  <br>  Did you get the tax is running out notice? if not then also mention that you hadnt gotten notice that they sent.|`|VUo09gpuaa	If you do not pay up they have the power to sieze the car and crush it so suggest you hide it or find a way to pay.<br>  Sell the car if you are not using it and pay the fine.<br>  Fine will increase the longer it is left unpaid.|`|epiuxybNaa	Sorry mate. You cant fight the MAN on this one. As far as the DVLA are concerned you have no excuse.  But try giving them a call and ask for a payment plan or time to pay.<br>    Good luck
E638ukebaa	I use 2 aswell, like to keep a bit of my arm strength on the handle bars.|`|3BoT1289aa	i use 2 fingers the same amount i use on ya muma and i just drop that **** get loose you dnt now how 2 ride til ya have had ya thrills and spills|`|5iCcdm42aa	same as everyone else i use 2 fingers, but sometimes if im goin fast enough i dont even use the clutch.|`|ekr6BBe3aa	I cut mine off for two fingers. They are a lot less likely to get bent this way also.
n5xNul6Yaa	Online reviews score them just about equally.  The TomTom is more well known - if you're picking between the two, I'd go that route.
ifqEXUxCaa	I left my secret scion decoder ring at home so I don't know wtf your talking about.|`|ntcETBTQaa	Are you talking about a scioni???<br>  u said ur bf take tc<br>  instead of xb?<br>  but he got the tc ...you should be happy|`|JsGX1bfRaa	Yes you want the TC. The xB is too small to really be useful as a utility vehicle and it doesn't have exciting performance either. At least with the tC you get some performance and it looks pretty good.|`|WHRCHLKmaa	another pointless question
kszkMlcXaa	2009 is cheaper, especially if it's used. but if money isn't the issue and you can afford to wait for the 2010 model, i'd say wait for it. there is no concrete proof or official release from scion about their 2010 model, and people are speculating about it having a more powerful engine. i also say wait because that way you can make a more informed decision on what you want, as all the information will eventually be provided. but if you need a car asap then just get the 09.|`|MExiWz7Zaa	theres really not a diffference to me

UnEQAsEEaa	Follow my train of thought.... it looks like a suppository...<br>  <br>  Naturally, I'm thinking that you might make a gift of it to the SERVANTS, Bobble.  That should keep them awake during working hours.|`|L1cBV8qQaa	The same place I keep my A380... in my imagination......  You asked this last year...|`|b75427b8123ccfcf5f8c87fc21a99672aa	You had asked the same question some time last year. The answer has not changed. It is said that delta-winged subsonic aircraft should be kept where the sun doesn't shine.|`|LNSiLxlBaa	I would suggest tearing down a local slum and putting it there.|`|12zwullSaa	You could find and rent an aircraft hanger is you want, don't know where you'd find one though.|`|JsGX1bfRaa	LOL thanks for the laugh! :)|`|Kr0ZDyp2aa	You can crash and burn in it|`|be9cdd794b8157d963218b4468745db7aa	Call John Travolta.

ljWMZ67Taa	Before you take the intake apart go to AutoZone and get a bottle of Lucas injector cleaner and try that in you tank. One thing allot of people don't think of is the transmission, when was that last serviced. Or she just might be tired
gXf4V45iaa	I had the same car and the struts never gave me a problem, had 137,000 miles|`|IICFEIE0aa	Nope ! You have to pay for your own replacements for your worn out shocks.  Better hurry and get them done before they are no longer available
dvgj6q6xaa	A built 350 GM will bolt right in.|`|LX0vjwXPaa	Cheapest and easiest would be to rebuild the current engine with high performance bottom end parts (pistons, crank, rods), and turbocharge/intercool it.  Next woudl probably be an upgrade to the Sky redline engine, because it's the closest to what you have in size and application.  There would be a lot of modifications necessary....
VUo09gpuaa	I get similar problens sometimes but only with certain and not all vehicles. Just have to put up with it till battery is charged then pull the charger out for a rest from it. Or put a CD on!
bB5ZPtvvaa	they use spacers or adaptors and quite frankly that is NOT adviseable  especially for a car that has cornering-performance capabilities.<br>  <br>  if you have a BMW and are looking to enhance the rims (larger or better than stock you should be buying them from a company with a GUARANTEED FITMENT POLICY and that bolt directly onto the car - no spacers - no adapters.<br>  <br>  perhaps like here<br>  <a href="http://www.tirerack.com/wheels/results.jsp?autoMake=BMW&autoModel=330Ci+Coupe&autoYear=2003&autoModClar=" rel="nofollow">http://www.tirerack.com/wheels/results.j...</a><br>  <br>  you pay so much to have your car serviced,  maintained, repaired,  why would you consider going cheap and poorly fitting on aftermarket wheels?|`|QpP1xJ4Naa	The offset of a wheel is determined when it is made. The offset can be moved out when mounted on the car with spacers. But not in. A change in off set will affect car handling and wear. A change of 3 mm should not be that noticeable. The scrub radius of the tire has been increased and the engineered point for the center of the tire no will no longer match the actual point of contact.|`|KLU4v00Daa	yes just get some 43 inch spring and there you go
