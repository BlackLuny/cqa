Now to the question.    1. Disagree with you there. PSN tries to live up to XBOX Live (in game XMB, trophies, in game music and even HOME were all brought in to try and outdo LIVE showing LIVE still is the better service even if it's paid for and PSN is free). PSN still hasn't managed despite the fact the two services are the same age (PS2 had access to online play)    2. You know what they're doing with all that 50GB? Multiplying data so load times are faster and you still have to install games (using time and hard disc space), so in reality you can have what essentially fits on a DVD (with some compression of course) copied a thousand times just to fix load times. DVD9 has no such problem.    The only PS3 games to not do that (that I know off) are MGS4 and Ratchet and Clank Future Tools.    3. I agree although none of the accessories are entirely necessary. You can choose to buy them or not buy them at all.    4.Agreed.    5. Shows how smart Sony are. They're losing money. Nice idea though, I'd like something like that on XBL.    6. With built in batteries you lose the wireless feature when you need to charge. What happens if the battery dies completely? The whole controller is ruined and needs throwing out. With a removable battery or charging station like on 360 you can play while you have another charging, battery runs out, swap the two over with no cables (keeping your wireless ability in the process).    Plus on XBOX there's the Play and Charge Kit: Just Like the USB method of charging on PS3 and there's a quick charge. 15 you get a rechargable battery and the charger so there're multiple ways of powering the control (standard AA or rechargable)    7. Bluetooth is just IR (only more expensive). The 360 uses IR and doesn't need any extra mumbo jumbo (it works out the box, literally). Bluetooth and IR do the same job, no need for extra things with either.    8. Wrong. Those 20 downloadable songs will probaby show up on XBL and XBOX gets the game sooner.    9. I don't know about the prices of PS3 accessories but I'll agree MS overprice their accessories for 360.    10. I'm not entirely sure there, although apart from MGS4, Future Tools what else has PS3 got that's already out (and doesn't suck).  360's got quite a few games in it's library that are high scorers (Bioshock included, started on 360), look at the 2007 games list.    PS3 is better in some areas and 360 in others. But where it mattered (Games, online, initial cost) PS3 just didn't cut it (even with its more powerful hardware). It had too few games to justify its price tag and the online was appalling, so 360 sold more, leading to 360 having its dominant position now. Sony promised things they couldn't deliver or took a long, long, time to|`|a2m8aqKNaa	here lemme put it this way, when you are using a console u use it for playing video games, right now the xbox 360 has way more games than the ps3 and alot more better exclusives coming out ie fable 2 Halo wars mass effect 2 gears of war 2, now the 360 is cheaper but thats because it dosent have as much technological hardware as the ps3 does (blue ray player wi fi or w/.e). so what you got to really as your self is this, will i really use my blue ray player (which in fact is pointless if u dont have a High def tv), now lets go to ONLINE game play True the PS3 might be free but Xbox live is a much more better and any ps3 fan boy can admit to that, yes u have to pay but wow 50dollars a year is nothing. Lets look at the video games u posted how many of them games will u actually buy, its 1 thing naminig them but what u like is a different story. Soul calibur 4 is out on xbox 360 aswell (u get Yoda in him), heavenly sword was really bad and half the games their are terrible aswell beside Kingdom hearts o and Bio shock is on the xbox 360 aswell.

My 320gb HDD for Ps3 - 55, a 120gb ( largest you cna get comapred to nearly 1TB on Ps3) is 80 for 360.    10. - you missed Uncharted, Oblivion GOTY(it has better grapihics ie longer draw distance, better res textures) n MGS4, n Resitance, n Gran Turismo, Wipout HD, n Fat Princess, n Final Fantasy XIII, Verus XIII, Infamous, etc, as well as the cross paltform stuff, though i will agree on Fable 2, my mates lendign my his 360 so i can paly it :D.    11. Ps3 saves lives both with the Folding@Home/Life With Palystaiton app, which genreates the highest WU'c and collectively give 1Petaflop of power, which is huge.  And cos the PS3 Cell chip is used in the IBM Roadrunner (worlds fastest, first to break Petaflop barrier) and soon in Graphichs cards n in some Toshiba laptops n upscaling DVD players.        However in defence my mates all got theires befroe the PS3 even reached our shores (in UK so had late sales cos of that Blu-Ray lens stock problem) so didnt have much choice.  Also the prospective 360 owners will probably measure up the features by the number that comes after the  or $ sign. Especially in the current economic situation. though tehy'll soon learn the 360 does have added cost on it.|`|ede89c6629ca141d2962614b4cd67a74aa	The numbers don't lie, just last month alone xbox outsold ps3 by 214%!! go to www.n4g.com if you don't believe me.

SO scr3w microsoft and sony is the best.pd3 is the best no doubt|`|AA11610572	1.) Speed is determined by your location or provider. Rarely, Microsoft shuts down XBL to update/upgrade it. They give PLENTY of notice before hand.     2.) DVD's are fine for games. Take good care of things and they will also be indestructible. Trust me, Blu-Ray is not the format of the futre, it's on it's way out. We'll see much bigger and better things in 1-2 years.    3.) 360's are cheaper than a PS3. In fact, if you're good at finding deals, you can get one for half the price of a PS3.    4.) The problems with the 360 have been well documented. But, Microsoft has been good with this, you can get a replacement console.    5.) Honestly, I haven't heard of shareable games for the PS3. If you're correct (you probably are), then the PS3 does have an advantage in this area.    6.) I assume here that you're talking about the wireless controllers, since they are the ones that need to have an energy source. Some good rechargeable batteries would be a good investment.    7.) This doesn't even make any sense. Bluetooth is not related to wifi in any way. Furthermore, bluetooth is one of the most fragile and unsecure connections out there.    8.) That's an arguable point depending your preferences. There is A LOT of downloadable content for XBL, more than for the PS3.    9.) The cheaper PS3 accessories are more of a compensation for the expensive console. 360 accessories cost more because the console costs less.    10.) That's more of a preference issue. However, the majority of people still believe the XBox 360 has superior games when compared to the PS3.    I'm not a fanboy of any console, just pointing out the facts.|`|EW7kRrWxaa	1 ya internet beter on psn lol dude  my friend 3 houses up has ps3 and oo i know the truth lol so i suggest u play 360 online before u judge  on that part    2 kk ya blue ray wins but dose it matter in gaming world right now? so no kk so dont try use that as line of defence. i give u thumbs up for not saying movies has who would pay 30 bucks for movie  and wtahc it one or twice or is thta just me? when there plenty of servies out there u can pay 5-10 bucks monht to rent 3 movies no late fees and swap them out in few days?    3 can care less about wifi has cords has better connections ya not every one has the modem by them but u buy longer one simple as that    4ps3 dont have problems? umm ya please go look it up. true but i rather play 11 months of a year and ship it off for 3 weeks and enjoy what i do so dose that hurt me? i have more fun with 360 then ps3 so therefor it don't hurt me       5 lol sony stupid for that  its that simple but ya that's nice feature but how many games you get? bet there old games     6 umm its called a play and charge kit? usb power cord on it or u can buy a dual charger to charge them 2 battery's at once? and plus  look here  battery might be buit in a controller but we all know rechargeable battery's dont last for ever  so there for when yours start to die u would be pay like 50 bucks for controller vs we pay 10 bucks if ares die?    7 umm kk w/e that means blue tooth mics? umm  i hear people complain about blue tooth mics say when they use it  makes the game lag. soo whats your point here? we have wireless mics and dont make game lag lol and u dont need buy no miicrosoft wireless mic theres other that work    8 20 songs soo i be enjoying rockband month before you do soooo. noob you funny    9 wtf are wireless mics are 50 bucks buddy get your price right   media remote? who cares?

But before I say anything I will admit that the Playstation is a better machine than the Xbox. The PS3 has more hardware power, is more reliable, etc.That is an indisputable fact. However, 360 owners(in general) think the 360 surpasses the PS3 in areas that are open to opinions. Such as better community, games, DLC, etc. I am not a fanboy but I personally believe the 360 is better than the PS3. I have to challenge some things that you have said. Games often have more DLC on LIVE than they do on PSN.(ex: Fallout 3) Also the 360 has more exclusive games than the PS3(fact). Many people also believe the exclusives are better.(You wont be playing Fable 2, Gears of War 2, or Left 4 Dead). And some of the games you mentioned can be played on the 360.(Mirrors Edge, Bioshock(2007), Soul Calibur 4, Dark Sector). There is no right answer to which system is better. People will always argue with everything. You bought the PS3 because you thought it was the best next-gen system and that's the same reason why I bought the 360. There will never be a concenus  1 video game system. Everyone has different opinions.

I would never give a company monies for no service. Instead, I would try to change phones, go to   the store, complain about your phone see what they can do for you the customer. Tell them how unhappy you are with their service.    good luck|`|qijxFQ2Raa	It isn't worth it unless you are really good typing on a touch screen. I'm not too good with it, so I didn't get the iPhone. I'd suggest finding a phone you like and that you'll keep and them make sure you can use it with AT&T. Then I'd suggest switching. Tell me what phone you'll get, I'm looking for a good texting one. =D
qijxFQ2Raa	If you made a mistake entering the word, just misspell it and add the correctly spelled word. Then if you type the word and it comes out as what it was before, just press the 0 button and keep pressing it until you see the word that you just entered in the dictionary. I think if you use the word enough it'll become the first entry to show up.
cUpwcxjraa	All you need to check is if that phone is a GSM phone like Nokia N Series. Definitely, you can use them with T-Mobile PAYG but the phone has to be unlocked. If you need unlocked phones, you can mail me or talk with me on Yahoo!

Maybe 5-10 with no songs? My brother has about 700 songs and 5 movies on there, so yeah.
LyfODGbVaa	Your best bet honestly is to just take the battery out and let it sit there for about a day. If it doesn't turn on after that, it probably won't come back to life. Sorry.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	take it apart and leave it to dry out for a few days.. unfortunately you may have screwed it up by trying to turn it on already.  My dad dropped one in the snow and turned it on, seemed fine, dried it out and it was broke.  Then with his new phone a few months later he dropped it into the river and pulled it out, dried it without popping it on and it worked just fine.  Best of luck!|`|LDv8OPJTaa	You need to try Silica Gel Packets to get it completely dry. There was a good article on iphoneatlas.com that had lots of good reviews about how to dry a wet cell phones, iPods, etc. You need to place your cell phone in a zip lock bag with Silica Gel Packets. Silica Gel will remove all the moisture from the phone and its components, something air drying will not do!     Just Google "Silica Gel Packets" and you will find several companies selling these products. There is also a web site called: http://www.SilicaGelPackets.com that has them.  |`|qijxFQ2Raa	Take the battery out and let the phone and batter dry. Then when it's done drying put the battery back in see if it works.|`|Q8AfZuWoaa	try sticking it in the freezer for a few hours.  It will help remove the excess moisture.  Make sure the battery is off and the phone is as open as you can make it|`|oUlrcvoIaa	dude, its broken. lol

REkYL5gOaa	I'd definitely get it, considering it's only $220 at the cheapest.  The pros: You will have tons of fun with the touch screen, it doesn't get old! Tons of games, Not just music. Cheap, small, portable, light, durable.    The Cons: Back gets scratched up bad no matter what.|`|4f3f6b2bec49c5905d31b312b45e4482aa	SO YOU DO HAVE INTERNET ACSSE BUT YOU NEED TO BE NEAR INTERNET CONNECTION LIKE LINKEYS IS A GOOD ONE BUT SOME WIFI IS LOCKED AND  NEED A PASSWORD AND IF YOU GET IT PUT A PASSCODE ON IT SO NO ONE CAN GET INN YOUR PERSONALLY DETAILS.  THE 8GB, HOLDS 1,750 songs,10 hours of video $229.00  THE 16GB HOLDS 3,500 songs 20 hours of video $299.00  THE 32GB HOLDS 7,000 songs 40 hours of video $399.00  YOU CAN DOWNLOAD MOVIES AND WATCH THEM  PUT PICS ON.CONTACTS LIST,YOUTUBE(WIFI CONNECTION) THAT'S ABOUT IT I KNOW I HAVE AN I POD TOUCH 8GB. IF IT FREEZES AND DOESN'T OPEN WHEN HOLDING BUTTON DON'T FREAK OUT JUST PLUG IT TO THE COMPUTER AND HOLD THE TOP BUTTON  IF IT DOESN'T APPEAR AND IF IT STILL DOESN'T APPEAR THEN JUST HIT AND BLOW IN THE WHOLE THAT'S WHAT I DO AND IT WORKS. YOU WILL LOVE THE IPOD . HOPE YOU LIKE IT.
5oe5k8DJaa	Basically what Sophie said only he didn't mean 2 GIGABYTES, he meant SECOND GENERATION. So with that said, if price is not obstacle, then the iPod touch PWNS all, unless you happen to have over 32 GB of iTunes stuff.    Also a pro to the nano (only one I can find) is that it is cheaper and smaller. But if you don't care about either, then get an iPod Touch. It has tons of free or cheap apps and games. Also, unlike any other iPods, it has a speaker, external volume buttons, and a TOUCH SCREEN! So I strongly recommend the iPod touch, mark my words you will NOT be sorry.|`|AA11388665	iPod nano 4g:                 pros: Hold lots of stuff                         Easy to use.                 Cons: No internet.                          Not a touch screen OBV                          Can't do as much      iPod Touch 2g                       Pros: Internet!!!                                Touch screen                                Easy to use                       Cons: Doesn't hold as much                                Have to be careful with the screen :/|`|HJbSZjxYaa	the ipod touch 2gb can do anything the ipod nano 4gb can do plus more like internet...the only con for the ipod touch 2gb is that it has less gb...but you can always get a 8gb or 16gb ipod touch...  sophie|`|4A9qAaKPaa	I think you should definitely get the new second generation ipod touch it has so many cool and new features that the new ipod nano doesn't have. The ipod touch has the cool app store which lets you download tons of cool apps and the new ipod touch has speakers so you can listen to music without headphones. ISN"T THAT AWESOME .Its great you won't be disappointed.|`|O8NYXsOPaa	GET THE IPOD TOUCH 2g it has internet and a bunch of games. IT only costs 229 299 and 399 but it has a nice 360by480 screen. The ipod nano is basically the same thing with the same 240by320 screen. Besides the nano's screen is horrible to watch videos on. You can also cover flow at the flick of your finger instead of scrolling in an awkward position

NpEY76THaa	they don't sell sidekicks where i live so i'll just tell you about my env2. i just got it 5 days ago & i love it. it's an overall really good phone, i haven't had any problems with it except that it sometimes sends text msgs 5 mins. after it's sent. but the good features about this phone is that the 2.0 megapixel camera is really good quality! it's even better than my sony digital camera, lol. the env2 is also a great mp3 player, it can store up to 1000 songs depending on how much gb your microsd card is. the full QWERTY keypad is amazing to text on. i would recommend getting the env2, although it is your decision. (: |`|L7Q1vlQkaa	EnV2|`|gqg7FlWzaa	probably the Env2 since its more recent and stuff.  :)
KqM0G6Rlaa	This phone is about an 8.5. I is an amazing phone, the features are amazing and its just so much fun. Its probably the best phone that AT&T has to offer right now. The only thing I would do to change it is to add a flash to the camera, other then that great phone. People always comment me on my phone an love to play with it!  As of now i have only had one problem with my Vu, and that was going back and hour with the time change and that wasn't even a big deal.  If you get it you wont be let down.|`|L7Q1vlQkaa	7 out of 10. The texting on the Vu is small and cramped. The phone has a pretty good camera but the phone gets boring after a while. 
ilScrvPEaa	Old 80GB has a chrome trim, 4 USB slots, a card reader, plays ~70% of PS2 games, supports SACD.    New 80GB (no chrome trim) has only 2 USBs, doesn't have a card reader, no PS2 games, no SACD support, reduced power consumption, self-cleaning function.    160GB is the same as a new 80GB, but with a larger HDD.|`|uctxzjIIaa	The 160GB has:    Bigger hard drive  Uncharted: Drake's Fortune  A voucher to download Pain for free  An extra $100 on the price tag.|`|v8wTklq1aa	Well, From what I have heard. The versions above 80gb do not allow you to play PS and PS2 games because I guess it costs Sony to much money to implement the system that allows you to play it. But I am not completely sure.|`|IEn14z5yaa	the earlier version of 80gb played ps2 games, memory card slot, and 4 usb ports  the later 80gb version has:  no backward compatibility  no sacd  2 usb ports    and then the 160gb (limited) was created to boost sales, no difference with the 80gb as the only difference is the hard drive space|`|RtP1zoe9aa	no there is not.|`|BkfHgstRaa	nope no differant.

I have one and it's horrible. They break easily; like everyone I know that has one has had the screen go white at some point, you're going to have to replace it soon. Also, after a couple months they start randomly turning off all the time. And by now, everyone has them. There are a lot of phones like the rumor, with a flip or slide out full keyboard, and most of them are a lot better. The Rumor has many flaws to it! :( I'm getting a new phone soon, a Palm lol 'cause those are really good.
LiGWTLpSaa	Probably when apple invents the newest iphone that will even have a "butt wiping" feature - this way you won't even have to do that anymore.

AA12397876	Now, I haven't played every single of these games, but I'll recommend the ones I have played.    Shadow of the Colossus really caught my eye, BUY THIS GAME. This game is really unique, in the sense that you only fight 16 bosses in the whole game, with no enemies in between. Now, this may sound bad on paper, but it really gives you a weird ( in a good way) feeling of loneliness. Speaking of feelings, you'll experience a wide variety of them, sadness, happiness, and so on. Each colossi needs a unique strategy to bring down, and figuring it out is half the fun ( seriously). The graphics aren't great technologically, but the artistic style is amazing, every colossi looks unique in a way. The music is epic, I forgot to add that to my answer in one of your questions about my fav video game songs, it gives you a feeling of dread, makes you want to kick @ss, and cry all at once. The game is only about 9 hours long, but it's still a GREAT game. My only major complaint with the game is that the camera is a bit hard to control and it moves around a lot.    It's my favorite PS2 game of all time    Here's a sample of SOTC's amazing soundtrack: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R3PRXFLJY...     Also, I recommend God of War 1 and 2    Metal Gear Solid 3 is also a classic    All of these are pretty cheap now, but they're all great games|`|pl2SocVKaa	well i think you should check out the mgs ones andbanjo kazooie jak and daxter god of war 1 and 2 and shadow of the colossus and maybe kingdom hearts or majoras mask|`|ox4MdqcVaa	Definitely get kingdom hearts 1 and 2, the stories aer awesome! I was really impressed with them, although some bits are a tad kiddish.    FFX-2 won't be any good to you unless you play the first one. I am only playing through it to find out the rest of the story. It's just a decent game, not amazing or anything like FFX.    But I can't give an honest oppinion because I havent played msot games on your list|`|3489372fd9644b611e4238a6eab6996caa	Man I must be getting old. The only one I recognize is Donkey Kong.

ExBiVj9qaa	Hi Avide,<br>  <br>  The solderless WiiKey2 is probably the best choice of the previous generation of mod chips but there are also new chips available that are solderless and easier to install.<br>  <br>  1. With a WiiKey2 ( more info at <a href="http://www.wiikey2.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.wiikey2.net</a> ) you don't have to worry about bricking your Wii because it has 'ascoreguard' built into the firmware to protect your Wii against updates from other regions, which in the past bricked some Wii's.<br>  <br>  2. You can play back-up games and original games for both the Wii and GameCube.<br>  <br>  3. Mod chips don't affect your Virtual Console games.<br>  <br>  4. All games from your region are compatible with the WiiKey2 or newer. 70-80% of games from other regions are also compatible.<br>  <br>  5. The new generation of mod chips can be switched off or are undetectable with stealth depending on which one you choose.<br>  <br>  There are now 3 new mod chips to choose from in the next generation of solderless mod chips, these are: DriveKey, FlatMod and Wasabi DX.<br>  <br>  All of these new mod chips have a load of features including compatability with all versions of the Wii. Here is a good article which list all the features of these new mod chips <a href="http://www.techsick.com/articles/wasabi_dx_flatmod_drivekey_flatmii_modchips_compared.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.techsick.com/articles/wasabi_...</a> <br>  <br>  I have listed some sites below for more information and where you can buy them from.<br>  <br>  PS: Forget about Soft modding your Wii because it is the soft mods that stop working when Nintendo release a firmware update Not the mod chips.<br>  <br>  Mod chips have never stopped working from a firmware update. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to soft mod, don't pay for it!!! Everything you need is available for free, just do a search for Homebrew Channel.|`|BMConIedaa	First of all, Nintendo frowns upon unauthorized hardware modifications.<br>  <br>  If you do a firmware update, it will probe your system for mod-chips.  If it finds one (and they usually do), it will wipe clean your firmware and reduce the functionality of your Wii to that of a $250 paperweight.<br>  <br>  It's not a wise move.|`|5HfuI3MEaa	you cant update the firmware, it will damage.<br>  yes you can play games you already own.<br>  yes, virtual console games work.<br>  yes, all games are compatible.|`|fqOncyLaaa	I wouldn't mess with the hardware of the wii when you have a software alternative <a href="http://tinyurl.com/ah4eov" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/ah4eov</a> I got this and it plays perfectly on my wii. I can watch movies, play games everything the modchip can do without the need to open my wii or make any hardware changes. If anything does go wrong in the future you can wipe this off and send to wii.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|c36b61dd807643b8a66ab55263b1b47faa	ill spare you the cliches. basically if you mod your wii, you are a dork. you know those monthly updates? yeah, those. once the next one comes after youve modded it, it fries your wii system. plus, you wont be able to play online, and like the others have said, youd have wated all the time spent on waiting for those beloved developers to create the game syou know and enjoy. really the modchips are a disgrace and anyone who buys and installs one needs to get his life straight, and stop being an impatient crook. point proven. CAN I GET AN AMEN??!?!?!?!!?|`|C7rV71Cjaa	Really dude I would just suggest passing on that option seeing as it is illegal, can break your Wii, Nintendo doesn't fixed hacked Wii's and that your are stealing hard work from game developers. I can't force you to do what I say but at least consider what I'm saying.
eSKPkbayaa	I think that statement is pretty good.  good luck!|`|Jbr1UquLaa	You had a cellphone at 13? Jeez.. I was 16 when I got mine and that's because I was starting to drive. I'm 19 now and I just got text messages which I pay for.     Any who, If they don't want you texting then don't get the sidekick  id. In fact, if you are going to present your case you should start with a cheaper phone. If you say you want the side kick they are going to see it and know it is for texting purposes mainly. If you are 15 do you actually have enough money to pay for half the bill every single month?   Also, I don't believe the not allowed to use other girl's phones because if you are in your cabin with your roommate and you use their how are they going to know?  Plus, isn't the point of camp to get away from the parents?     I say go for a cheaper phone with a cheaper plan to start out, then later on ask for text messaging (you'll survive without it for a few months or a year) Still offer to pay half the bill and then pay for texting yourself when it comes (it's like what 10-15 bucks a month (mine's 10 a month for 1000 sent and received. but 15 is unlimited.)   When you present it, if they say no don't whine about it but present it more in a I would really like to have a way to contact you guys incase of an emergency. You know, pretty soon (if this is true and 16 if the driving age for you state) I'm going to be driving and I would feel much safer if I had a phone incase anything happens.     good luck.|`|4a82e3f7c7dd6e6b2ed3898214307e46aa	well my 1st thought is your going away to camp to have fun and it doesnt sound like your parents are worried not being able to talk with you...when my kids go to camp I dont speak with them either.    2nd I think you just want the phone to call your friends.   You can always ask for your privilages back but I doubt it will work. Do you have a job or how will you be paying for even 1/2 of this?|`|46981ebb6214b0be4cf57bf365fe4b42aa	wouldn't u go 2 camp 2 get away from ur parents? i would!
1485ed10658f5fff9f00587d44259041aa	You need to make multiple users on your computer.  When you turn the computer on, it probably goes right to the main window screen, but you can set it up to where there is more than one user.  After you turn your computer on, just go to start, settings, control panel and then click on user accounts.  Go to create new account, and it is super simple.  Then, you can log out of windows and onto the new user's account, set up iTunes, and start your own library.  Make sure in your preferences you don't have "share all files" checked in iTunes.  If you don't share, then you each have your own library.  If you do that, then iTunes is separate on each user, it is almost like 2 different computers.  Then, if you purchase something on one user, and the other user wants it, you plug their iPod in when you are logged into your user account on the computer, and then you can download their stuff and delete what you don't want.  It is a pain, but that's what we do.   It would be so much easier if you could just have 2 iTunes libraries, wouldn't it?   Good luck!|`|Ozw9VpJaaa	No because you can delete songs and add other ones the other person doesnt want i suggest you dont do that|`|4AlHbvEWaa	when you connect one of the ipods it says that "select the checked items on any ipod|`|708d55f62cd1f4207560a1ba29981b6aaa	there can be two itunes on 2 computers. if you each have your own account on the pc. then thats the only way it will seperate your music on ur own files and u can have ur own itunes on ur one account. if u need to make an account go to    then u do what u need to do from there>  listen to me u can just make a sperate account for her.

hPRJpiSqaa	Respondiendo como debe ser de manera objetiva y sin fanatismo cegador y al mismo tiempo estupido, el cual podemos encontrar tanto en religion, politica, moda, prefernecia por equipo de futbol, etc.    Pues como muchos ya lo dijeron es una consola de nueva generacion, por el hecho de que es la actual de Nintendo; ahora bien ?Que en verdad sea capaz de competir y compararce a sus rivales?, pues para esto la verdad la pone en desventaja enorme, independientemente de sus graficos que muchos critican; hasta yo no me habia querido dar cuenta y aceptar del todo esto, ya que antes se decia que la Wii era un Game Cube mejorado no solo por su inovacion e interacion con su control en el modo de juego, si no mas bien se referian a que serian a los mismos graficos de esa generacion, pero tristemente te confuieso que desde mi punto de vista carece hasta de esto, mas bien retrocedio hasta en este aspecto.    Y con respecto al videojuego que mencionas, te aseguro que no solo no viste graficas espectaculares si no mas bien no viste la version que los de la competencia vieron (a mi me sucedio con Star Wars: The Force Unleashed y Alone in the Dark), y en este caso es algo triste ya que las personas encargadas del(os) videojuego(s) se pulieron mas tanto en modo de juego como en otros aspectos haciendo la EXPERIENCIA INOLVIDABLE, algo que hay que recornocer que hasta el mismo Nintendo tenia pero ahora parece que esta perdiendo cada vez un poco mas.     Aun asi mi apoyo esta con Nintendo, esperando que en algun momento despierte de sus laureles y se ponga las pilas.    Por cierto de los que podria decir que somos adultos y que crecimos con Nintendo, es decir con mucha experiencia en el asunto perseptual (Shaka, Salash, Daven, tu, etc-personas que han tenido las 3 consolas y dan su opinion- y en algun momento hasta yo), hemos declarado habiertamente este aspecto, esperando hacer conciencia en la comunidad, pero la respuesta es vanal ya que los demas solo esperan oir y ver lo de siempre (sin cambio, sin revolucion), pues solo dire pobre gente de mente cerrada, en verdad, si esto lo aplican a todo en lo que a su vida se refiere.

Pues los juegos que salen en mas de una consola, a Wii le toca el Port del PS2, port significa que solo adaptan los controles, y que las graficas quean igual, el Wii puede para mas, pero tampco quedara como el 360 o el PS3 claro :/    Tal vez cuando le den "Game Over" al PS2, los juegos multiplataformas en Wii tengan mejor calidad...

Juegos como Call of Duty son mejores en el PS3 y XBOX 360 debido a que se suprimen muchos de los modos de juego online en la versin de Wii.    Sin embargo, NO EXISTE un Mario Galaxy o un Zelda Twilight Princess para ningn otra consola, de igual modo Halo 3 es solo para Xbox y MGS4 o Little Big Planet es solo para PS3    Diferentes consolas para diferentes gustos, la opcin ms sabia es disfrutar lo mejor de cada una, caer en fanatismos de marcas es, con todo respeto, una actitud infantil que te limita disfrutar de toda la variedad de juegos que la creatividad de cada empresa nos ofrece.|`|kFXFXQetaa	Yo opino que el wii, el x-box 360 y el psp3 son las consola de una nueva generacion.

tecnicas esta muy por debajo de las otras consolas, a mi parecer esta mal compararla, el wii vino a cambiar la manera de jugar y apost por un diferente mercado que es del jugador casual, y algunas desarrolladoras no se an molestado en sacar juegos que exploten las capacidades del wii, algunos son solo adaptaciones del ps2 como resident evil 4 ademas que nintendo ya no esta enfocado al jugador hardcore.     en lo personal ami me va bien un wii ya que no juego demaciado, si estoy yo solo al cabo de tres horas jugando me enfado, disfruto mucho de los shooters tipo arcade, el wii se presta para este tipo de juegos por sus controles y hay algunos ttulos como los clsicos house of the dead, solo hay que saber que jugar y con amigos puede llegar a ser muy divertido.|`|LUUSreDHaa	Los de

te van a reportar maduren....respecto a tu pregunta yo considero que el wii podria ser que se considere consola de nueva generacion pero esta muuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu... alejado a lo que es el ps3 y el 360 y realmente es la estupidez mas grande compararlo con cualquiera de las otras 2 y que el wii esta en clara desventaja y no estoy hablando ocmo fanboy ni de 360 ni de ps3 lo digo como gamer.ya que el wii se enfoco totalmente al juego casual de cuando lleguen tus primos jugar un rato con ellos pero es una idiotes decirte un hardcore gamer teniendo un wii...me refiero es que mucho hablar de que va a salir un juegos y que no se que pero simplemente el wii no se pude comparar ni al 360 ni al ps3 empezando por los graficos,sonido etc....ademas de su catalago de juegos no puede comparar un mario kart con un GEar of war,Gran turismo etc....en fin si puede ser llama consola de nueva generacion pero esta en categoria diferente al 360 y el ps3...El wii es para cuasuales jugar un rato en la tarde..El ps3 y xbox 360 es para hardcore que de verdas les gustan los juegos de video  a mi parecer fue una lastima lo que hiso nintendo ya que como en todo hay personas que aveces les gustara un fifa,RE,NFS etc...y por algna razon siempre son increiblemente faciles no se si sera por la poca capacidad de procesamiento mi punto es que yo tengo un wii pero para jugar con mis primos etc...ya que no los voy a poner a jugar FAllout o Gear of war pero claro si te consideras un verdadero gamer siempre tener una consola de verdad ya que si te crees hardcore gamer(como algunos de aqui)solo porque sacaron todas las estrellas de mario etc..que pena me da"YEAH"en que momento dije yo que el wii no me gusta?????!!!!!!!!!!!!dije que es una buena consola para pasar el rato pero si eres hardcore gamer necesitas un ps3 o 360 o no leistes la parte en que dije que tenia wii??porfavor antes de hablar leer bien las cosas PONGAM TODAS LAS MANITA ABAJO SI NO SABEN DE

PIF4h7W6aa	Can't jailbreak iPod Touch 2nd Gen using Quickpwn. I suggest doing some homework on it.|`|grvNBF7waa	hey go to youtube and type in ipod touch jailbreak gui and then there will be a video in which you call download all the files at once....you actuall can use quick pwn but have to have all the right files..
aZEX8XaGaa	When I first heard there was going to be an update that basically turns the 360 into the ultimate media center I was excited. Now that I have it it's a lot of fluff. We heard we could rip games to our hard drive, you can but you have to have the disk in the machine to play it?? What's the point??  Now people have a reason to buy the big hard drives. You could download movies to the 360 before and now with netflix you can stream them but if you've ever seen the selection you know it's a rip off, plus Sony Studios blocked all their movies because of the PS3. So the selection will be even less. I'm a 28 year old male not a 14 year old japanese girl, why in the hell do I care about creating an avatar? I'm sorry I loved the xbox consoles because they didn't have all the useless extra crap like the Wii.     Microsoft leave the social networking to facebook and myspace, I bought a 360 for the games not to talk with my friends online as we share music and ideas on how to make our avatars uber sweet. (By the way that was sarcasm I don't say the word uber) I wouldn't mind the update so much if Microsoft didn't make it mandatory, if they would have just given every user the choice to update that would have made me happy. Now I have this POS dashboard that I'm going to dread navigating every time I want to go download a demo.    I have a bachelors degree in marketing, been out of college for 5 years, spent the first 3 in sales and the past 2 in market research. I guarantee this dashboard was created by some marketing genius for the sole purpose of generating sales not improving the gamer experience as it has been billed.  Just look at the amount of things that you can purchase now than what you could before on the old dashboard. OK I'm done ranting :) If you enjoy it more power to you, it does look pretty I'll give you that. But I'm just telling it like it see it.|`|AA11165411	i love it! the new interface is sweet and fun to use! its also clean and really eye appealing. i like the change. the avatars are fun as well.|`|REkYL5gOaa	Ryan S is really racist for using the Japan stereotype.|`|1lPwUSqXaa	Im downloading it now. it sounds awesome though.|`|qGXXjqnVaa	I promise the only reason they made the avatars is so that in the future they can sell clothing items on xbox live marketplace|`|WTUhXhP5aa	Spartan I'm sorry if you like the avatars and you're not a Japanese girl, I didn't mean to offend you but I really don't care if I did. You're obviously very familiar with sarcasm. I'm just curious about something, how is saying "Japanese girls like avatars" racist? In case you don't own a dictionary here you go.    Noun 1. racist - a person with a prejudiced belief that one race is superior to others    I'm pretty sure I never said I was better than the Japanese. Enough with the political correctness, I'm not a politician so I don't have to be careful of what I say so....**** you. 
EFU26WxFaa	I have neither so I am not biased.  Yes both consoles have good games but I like the PS3 better for its potential and Sony's history of getting good games exclusively on their system.  My roommate has a XBOX360 and it is nice but he misses out on Metal Gear 4, God of War 3, Gran Turismo, and MLB09.    I think if you are getting a system with your money, then go for a cheaper Xbox360.  If your parents are getting one for you, get a PS3.|`|uKulGXhwaa	XBOX360 WOULD BE THE RIGHT CHOICE TO PICK, PLUS THE ONLINE IS AWESOME AND IT HAS AWESOME GAMES TOO    GOOD LUCK!|`|CKmXgTUqaa	Xbox sucks but xbox 360 i would say is better than ps3|`|Qky4RR2Caa	Do you know how many times this question been asked?

3a671a7fc22386bc37b64483d80da9a6aa	The Red Ring of Death is an error signal for the Xbox trying to tell you "Something went wrong, but my makers didn't give me a more specific error message".  So anything that goes wrong, and the console doesn't know exactly what failed, will produce a RRoD.    For example: A power surge during a lightning storm caused a few lamps to flicker in our house, and the Xbox 360 lost power for a short time causing it to RRoD.     So even if you have gotten 3 red segments, it doesn't mean it's *the* Red Ring of Death.      Regarding the small fan on the back: These things don't do much good. You can test yourself if the fan is an improvement by doing the following:  Get a medium sized plastic bag. Tape it on the rear of the console and let the bag inflate without the fan. Stop the time until the bag has reached a certain size.   Now repeat it with the additional fan in place.   If the time needed to inflate the bag is more than half of the time needed without the fan, leave the fan aside. It's of no use.     Also read the interview below for info about the external fans from an engineer who designed and built the Xbox 360.     Having the Xbox lying or standing on a flat hard surface (wood, glass, hard plastic, basically anything that isn't "fluffy") will help in keeping the Xbox 360 cool.|`|Vx4w4Cx5aa	The same happened to my 360 - turned out it was just a cable that lost its connection and that meant it had to scare me by giving me the ring of death! :P|`|1fJVvRFMaa	if you mean that you have an intercooler then you have voided the warranty.

If it breaks send it to Microsoft.|`|mGD2n4cNaa	That happened to me once. After a month, it broke down....Took 2 weeks and its back in action!|`|TdtswfEhaa	If it goes away, you're okay for the time being. It could have just been a loose cable that gave you the Red Rings.     Not to worry, if it happens again, (as long as your xbox is less than 3 years old) Microsoft will replace it at no charge.    The surface doesn't really matter, Just keep it out in the open so it stays ventilated.... Sounds like you're doing everything right.

AA11057445	You must have an in-store account to sign up for the Game Pass AND a valid credit card on file with the store.  They only work at the location you sign up in.. IE you can't go into Blockbuster B and rent something on your Game Pass if you signed up at Blockbuster A.      Once you decide you want it, tell the employee working, and all they do is sign you up.  They charge the credit card on file right then and there, because you pre-pay for your service.  Every month on your sign-up date, they charge the credit card on file on your account for your Game Pass.      You cannot pay cash.  You have to use a credit card.  You don't have to sign any paperwork.  You can cancel it at any time.  If you want to try it for a month and see if you like it, sign up for it and immediately have them cancel it.  You'll get the benefits of the pass for a month, and then on the last day, it cancels.  But be warned.. If you have any games out ON THAT DAY, they convert to a regular rental and regular rules and fees apply.     Hope this helps!

Probably if it came with a USB cable cord. Just open iTunes, and drag the music files to the usb cable  icon on the desktop...GOOD LUCK!|`|pl526ui6aa	As the music in iTunes is encrypted with DRM, you cannot directly put it on any non-Apple MP3 player. The easiest way is to burn the music to an audio CD and then rip it back to Windows Media Player or a similar program as an MP3. Or you can get some software to help you. I use TuneClone to do this. Though not free, it is very well worth a try.    Below is its step by step tutorial about how to get iTunes music converted to MP3:  http://www.tuneclone.com/itunes8-m4p-to-...

RayKaIZqaa	Don't worry about it. Xbox Live is messing up for a lot of people right now. It should be fixed soon. I think it has something to new with the new update and possible bugs. |`|v7HC2MGXaa	hmm.. now is this the xbox live like something is wrong with your account? like lack of paying? usually if it is the internet itself it would not say xbox live.. try this:    unplug the router, and the ethernet cable from your xbox. wait like a min or two..    plug the router back in. then plug in the ethernet cable to the xbox after the router fully started up. make sure you dont turn on your xbox til after everythign is plugged in. i hope this helps. when my 360 doesnt connect this usually helps. other then that break out the ATM card and pay up. good luck.|`|Qy0OsgiLaa	Are you sure your live membership is still good?

First of all you will need to download 2 different software, both free.  -DVD Shrink-  http://www.softpedia.com/progDownload/DV...     -Handbrake-  http://handbrake.fr/?article=download   (select the GUI windows download)    Now that both of these are installed on your desktop, insert the DVD in your pc. If it starts playing automatically stop it and leave it in your pc. Now open up DVD Shrink. Once open you will click the open disc icon in the top left. A new window will open. Select the drive that has the DVD in it and hit OK. Once it has down its thing you will see 3 folders on the left under the DVD structure. Select the one that says Main movie. Once selected you will see 3 options on the right,   ( Video, audio, subpicture) Uncheck all of the boxes that are not english. Now click the re-author button.Now you will see three more options pop up on the right (menu, main movie, extras) Under the main movie on the right you will see title 1. Doubleclick it. Title 1 should now appear on the left under DVD structure and will be highlighted. Now click the backup button up top. A new box will appear. Under the select backup target: Hard disk folder.  Under select target folder for DVD output: browse were you want the files temporarily I put mine in the My video folder under My documents.  The create video_ts and audio_ts box should be checked. Click okay. Now this might take an hour or so while it is encoding. Once it finishesyou will now have 2 new folder under My Videos in My Documents. Close DVD Shrink if it is still open.    Open Handbrake software on you desktop. Go to the source in the top left corner. Select the DVD/ Video_ts folder. Then go to My Documents and then to My Video. Then select the Video_ts folder and hit OK. The CLI is about to read your source window opens. This might take a few minutes. Once this box disappears click browse under the the destination area. Once again select My Documents then My Videos. a new box opens. Under the file name you will type the name of your movie and click save. On the right under presets highlight ipod. Now under the output settings dropdown select MP4 file. Under the picture settings change the width/height settings to 320X240. Now select the video tab. Under the video codec select MPEG-4 . Under the constant quality move the slider to 70-100%. Now click the Start button at the top. A black box will appear. This will take an hour or so.   Once it finishes you will have MPG4 movie file in your My Video folder. Close Handbrake. You can open itunes. Click on file in the top left. Select Add file and upload the MPG4 to your ipod. That's it. All of this software is free. And if you follow my directions you should have no problems. GOOD LUCK.......|`|gkk9F8FEaa	Buy or download...you choose. Exilisoft DVD Ripper.

This guitar is great for beginners, however you will more than likely want to upgrade in a few years seeing as the amp is very small and the pickups tend to have a washed out sound the louder you play it.  i have played other bundle package beginner guitars and they are not very good. As for Epiphone guitars in general i am very pleased with them they are quality guitars but are much cheaper than say their counter part Gibsons, seeing as epiphone is a division of gibsion. I have owned two of their guitars and am very satisfied with them both.

SpmVBVieaa	Buy an SD card compatible with the wii, insert it into a friend's wii that has the internet channel, copy it to the SD card, and insert it in your wii.|`|tzFkYLGqaa	Sorry no.    Its called the Internet Channel.    It costs 100 Wii Points and you have to buy them from the Wii Shop Channel.    You can buy a card thats worth 2000 ($20) and you can buy it in Walmart,Target,Best Buy,Gamestop and EBgames.    Good luck and with the 1500 Points you have left,You can buy for example Super Mario Bros 1 2 or 3 and a lot of different games.    -Good Luck!!!!!|`|C7rV71Cjaa	There is no way to get it for free. You have to buy it from the Wii Shop Channel for 500 Wii Points.|`|xwaqN7t6aa	you cant, they offered it for free to start, now its 5$ i think. Without voiding your warranty There'ss no way to legally get it for free|`|9HM4Cs2laa	no you have to buy it from the wii shop channel
bhWgo8OTaa	Your warrantee will cover anything from one dead pixel to the whole phone being smashed up. As long as you haven't had your phone for the amount of time your warrantee lasts for, you should ring up your nearest Apple store and ask them to repair it. You may even be able to persuade them to come and pick it up, as you have a FREE warrantee, so shouldn't have to waste petrol/diesel/gas money just to deliver it. After all, all you have to do is blame it on them. If they get defiant, just pretend to be really angry. Always works ;)|`|383274df75c0b1332287ac9be27fd53eaa	you should be able too, just go and complain. but my best advise is tell them that your battery has been extremely bad compared to your friends 3G iphone. tell them that while in standby the battery drains pretty fast, that will definitely get you a new one. no questions asked.|`|QQtei21Daa	The warranty does cover dead pixels.    It covers everything except for negligence (so dropped, lost, stolen, water damage, etc.).
kHwjvZKgaa	Games have a fairly low markup so not much, but accessories were steep when my brother worked there. Things may be different now though. But when he worked there cables and stuff where dirt cheap.

IRTsTnpqaa	Trade in some of your old games. Then pay the difference if you can find a used copy then you can probably get for about $40. Try gamestop, eb games etc|`|B2Itq6Fcaa	yea ebay|`|YKc3YrxXaa	As of right now, no, because the game just came out, and big titles like Call of Duty will always be launched at $60 for PS3, Wii, and Xbox 360.    For PS2, the game is $40 at Best Buy and other major retailers though.    If you must get COD5 for Xbox, Wii or PS3, then you'll just have to wait a while or you can look online.    Hope this helps!!|`|rrkDfoOKaa	check an ebay games in the used section. they might have it. they usually test used gamnes briefly|`|YeFi54U2aa	like maybe a used copy thats been scratched and broken and burned a thousand times. there not gonna sell even used for that low

They take care of problems right away. Their in store service leaves something to be desired. When you ask them a technical question, they look at you like a deer caught in headlights. Those people are really just there to sell you a phone.|`|CzADhpTUaa	i have alltel and i live in north east wisconsin. the service is great!! i always hav bars and the reception is like soooo awesome its the best cell phone provider ive had...by far.... i would totally recommend it!! :)|`|383274df75c0b1332287ac9be27fd53eaa	Alltel merged with verizon so your going to have good service anywhere you go.|`|gL0ppoh9aa	I agree with everything gdog said about the stores lol. I have an alltel phone and I also work for them as a tech support rep. We get ppl calling in complaining about the stores way too often.     I live in Az tho and have never really had an issue with the phone, besides that one big outage we had a few months back. Other than that everything is all good. I think they have the best plans

6NvlEEgHaa	absolutly. it is my fav. wii game. great to play online and is the best shooting game i have played for the wii so far. it will open the doors for more games like it with online features for the wii in the future. it never gets old and has a great replayable value. graphics are good for wii but do not compare to 360 or ps3. just as fun tho. just with less types of games. shooting may be hard to start off, but no worries it will come to you quickly. i strongly recommend it. worth the money|`|Esl2Ogi7aa	yes get it! i loved it. its kinda short though like all ccod games(i beat it in 2 days!)|`|1AOjQSwOaa	Get it for wii because there are too many assholes hacking the X box 360 they use cheats (By cheats i mean HACKS) while on wii no one uses cheats and is easier to play good controls fast aiming (If you play online don't use the mp40 because MP40=COWARD) if you need help online in wii i can help (seriously) and there is alot of people playing wii right now so you don't have to wait to get playing online  MY Friend code is:257869738765

Both brilliant games, but again I'm not sure if they'd be suitable for a 14 year old.  - Timesplitters 2  - Splinter Cell: Chaos Theory   - Star Wars: Battlefront 2, especially if you like Star Wars.  - Call of Duty 2 and 3.  - Jak 3, I've only played it briefly myself, but I know some people that think the world of it.   - I hear you can also get the original Half Life on Ps2, one of he best games ever if you ask me.

kHwjvZKgaa	You will need a phillips screw driver.     Once you have unscrewed the cover then you will need to unlatch the cover. Gently prying it up should do it. Don't rush no need to break it.     Once inside you will see everything is put together with screws and most wires are connected with plugs.    It's really easy to fix a PJ. So if you have tech knowledge it's not hard.     Usually there is a screw on the bottom that you need a long phillips for.     Don't blow canned gas into your PJ. It could get dirt in the light line, which you can take a apart. If it where the ep719 i could give you more specific instructions, but I think this gives you a good start.

ee75e4ac3fde23d30c5b196cd3f2364eaa	Three GSM bands used by mobile phones. There are four GSM bands around the frequencies 900MHz, 1800 MHz (Asia and Europe), 1900 MHz and 850MHz (North America/US).  A GSM Cell phone that supports quad band will support all 4 of these bands. A triband GSM phone typically supports 900MHz, 1800MHz and 1900MHz and will do for most of the world. You will only lose out the 850MHz band in the US which should not be much of an issue.    See:  Triband: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triband_%28...  Quad Band: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quad_band  GSM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GSM|`|8b1e16f66faba3c61151302442d9fba9aa	Bands are the systems different world regions use as standards to connect to the cellular (mobile phone) network.   There are 3 - Europe, U.S. and Asia.  A triband phone will be able to operate in all 3 regions.|`|2354f968aa30d70fe0512de53d23d5d1aa	Triband phones (also known as tri-band) are mobile phones that support three frequency bands.    [edit] 2G    Various countries use different frequency bands for their mobile networks, and a triband phone can be used on three of these bands, generally speaking, chosen to favor two of the home country's bands, and one for roaming in other countries.    In summary GSM frequency bands used around the world are:        * 850 MHz (In America)      * 900 MHz (In Europe)      * 1800 MHz (In Europe and Asia)      * 1900 MHz (In America)    2G Triband phones are mobile phones that support the GSM 900/1800/1900 MHz bands (commonly sold in Europe, Asia, and Africa), or alternatively the 850/1800/1900 bands (commonly sold in the Americas).    A 2G Quad band (850/900/1800/1900) offers more coverage and is now really common.    [edit] 3G    Devices offering UMTS / HSDPA in 850/1900/2100 MHz bands (2100MHz for Europe and 850/1900MHz for America) or in 850/1700/2100 MHz bands (850 or 1700/2100 MHz for America) are available.    HSUPA / HSDPA / UMTS is a further evolution.    Note that being UMTS / HSDPA / HSUPA triband doesn't mean that phone is a GSM / GPRS / EDGE triband. An HSUPA triband could not being a GSM at all. However nearly all HSUPA (or HSDPA only) triband are EDGE quad band too.    Some HSDPA 850/1900/2100 triband are already available: HTC TyTN, HTC Advantage X7500; Huawei E800 Data Card (ExpressCard); i-mate JASJAM, Ultimate series 5150 6150 7150 8150 9150 (all five available alternatively in 850/1700/2100 bands).    Some HSUPA 850/1900/2100 triband are already available: Huawei E270 Wireless modem (USB); Novatel Wireless Merlin X950D ExpressCard ; Option GlobeTrotter Express HSUPA, GlobeTrotter GT MAX HSUPA, GlobeSurfer iCON HSUPA, GTM380; Sierra Wireless AirCard 880 and the AirCard 881 (PC Card), AirCard 880E and the AirCard 881E (ExpressCard) and MC8780 and the MC8781 (PCI Express).|`|75107d92736ad6fea72a78e30303fbdaaa	basically the three continents mentioned and 46 countries|`|AA12372105	Lots of nice long techincal answers from my learned freinds above!

It's these two things which has led to the huge success of the ipod.     Despite the fact that Apple were going into an already established market with pioneers such a Creative, Iriver and Mpman, the ipod had something which none of these others had: a solid marketing strategy to target the consumer not just the enthusiast. They did this by focusing on the product name then a few things it could do rather than technical specifications. Apple realised there was a market for mp3 players and was the first to truely take advantage of it despite being the newcomer.    As a consumer, when you switch on the TV and see pop stars like Bono or Madonna dancing around with a new gadget that embraces the already popular internet - you are easily sold. When people in the work place who are not computer savvy start talk about the ipod, you want to join the club.    Word of mouth does the rest. When people are saying 'I'm thinking about getting an ipod' instead of 'I'm thinking about getting a mp3 player' you know you have achieved your greatest objective and made a global impact.    The Ipod is in no way, shape of form superior to other mp3 players, a good example would be the Creative Zen Vision which technically beats it in almost every area except size, but the ipod will win social arguments because its brand name is embedded in the fabric of society.    Couple this branding success with the innovative Itunes and you have a winning formula which will always be hard to beat and which will provide you with long term revenue.    Now the brand is established, Apple can go on to the Iphone and similar ventures and do well. So in short the ipod is a iconic gadget due to branding and marketing, something which other companies overlooked or felt the market wasn't fully ready for.

It is very fussy with any kind of audio file not encoded by itself or itunes.    Normal mp3's should play but since you got them from limewire some might have been encoded elsewhere and the ipod might not play them due to it detecting copyright infringements.    Short answer, dont follow the fashion hype, ipods are the most constrictive and manipulative mp3 players on the planet.    It will only get worse especially if they update its firmware against such practices, Apple want you to buy music through itunes, thats the whole point. I advise to get a decent mp3 player like the Creative Zen M and save yourself even more future problems and always having to waste time having your internet ready files encoded in AAC or mp4 for your ipod.    Honest answer from a enthusiast.|`|iwb9bWcVaa	you drag the songs to party shuffle then drag those songs to where ipod is and then go to the top where it says file and click sync ipod

383274df75c0b1332287ac9be27fd53eaa	Well Apple initially offered the iphone to Verizon, and they rejected it. So i doubt apple will go back to Verizon since they've had so much success with at&t. Also just like the previous answer apple wont go through the trouble of making a CDMA version of the iphone. However Verizon & at&t will be using LTE ( Long Term Evolution) for their 4G technology which is a GSM technology so when apple comes out with an 4G iphone using LTE it is possible both Verizon & At&t could use the iphone.    This morning i went online a found a post on modmyi.com that the iphone might be coming to sprint/verizon as early as 2009. follow the link below to the post its very interesting news.    http://www.modmyi.com/forums/iphone-news...|`|LzSj90pbaa	att has exclusive rights for 5 years.  it was released in 2007  |`|cUpwcxjraa	Unfortunately, they won't be available on Verizon.

I don't understand what you mean they have crappy service plans, they have way better coverage than t-mobile and rollover minutes.

While analog isn't directly comparable to digital, 720x480 should capture 200 analog lines acceptably. Blu-ray should compress the video a bit less heavily than DVD, but VHS picture quality is poor enough to begin with that a few MPEG II DVD artifacts should be the least of concerns.

Sell your camera on Ebay or Craigslist!  Anywhere but a camera shop!  I would suggest Ebay as I use Ebay the most with the least issues.

They will take advantage of that if you don't have a set price you know you can get for it.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	The camera is not worth that much. The XT was launched in 2005 the XTi based heavily on that camera was released in 2006, in the digital world, it's old because models come out so fast, and it's an entry level model.    I see the XTi body only for as little as $250. Remember that Canon sold a zillion of these, they are common. Also, if the lens is a standard kit lens, it's worth very little. If you sprang for a really nice piece of glass, that will be worth something.    Unlike the bodies, good glass holds its value.    Either way look at craigslist or ebay to sell.    Watch out for craigslist scammers that offer to send you bank checks and ask you to ship. Deal in person, bring a friend, meet in public, cash only.    As for the camera shop, they aren't really out to rip you off. They can't pay you what the camera goes for used. If they did, how would they sell it? They have rent and employees to pay for.    So they can't pay more than half, so they can make at least that much in profit.    Good luck.|`|Ga9oCLavaa	In this economy, I would say around $100.

4XXa7wBxaa	Personal computer (PC) is any general-purpose computer whose original sales price, size, and capabilities make it useful for individuals, and which is intended to be operated directly by an end user, with no intervening computer operator.    Today a PC may be a desktop computer, a laptop computer or a tablet computer. The most common operating systems are Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X and Linux, while the most common microprocessors are x86-compatible CPUs, ARM architecture CPUs and PowerPC CPUs. Software applications for personal computers include word processing, spreadsheets, databases, games, and a myriad of personal productivity and special-purpose software. Modern personal computers often have high-speed or dial-up connections to the Internet, allowing access to the World Wide Web and a wide range of other resources.    A PC may be a home computer, or may be found in an office, often connected to a local area network. The distinguishing characteristics are that the computer is primarily used, interactively, by one person at a time. This is in contrast to the batch processing or time-sharing models which allowed large expensive systems to be used by many people, usually at the same time, or large data processing systems which required a full-time staff to operate efficiently.    While early PC owners usually had to write their own programs to do anything useful with the machines, today's users have access to a wide range of commercial and non-commercial software which is easily installed.|`|ygGr1nX7aa	Stands for Personal Computer.

Once the charging port is bad, you have to get it repaired....or you can walk around carrying a dead phone.

uVIHou7Aaa	There are many variations.  Sometimes referred to by numbers, and sometimes by technology.  I know mostly the Dolby based formats.  There are also DTS formats, but they generally mirror what Dolby offers and Dolby has a much wider market.    For reference, Mono sound (one channel) is considered 1.0 sound.  Mono can be played through 1 or more speakers, but your getting 1 signal.  Stereo sound (2 channels) is considered 2.0 sound.  Stereo is typically played through 2 speakers (left & right).      Here's where it gets more complicated.  Basic surround sound is called 4.0, made popular as Dolby Surround.  The receivers that decode it have Dolby Pro Logic circuits in them.  Signals consist of front Left, front center, and front right signals (each usually played through a single speaker) and a single rear back channel (sometimes played through 1 or 2 speakers).  Dolby Surrond/Pro Logic sounds o.k. and gives you decent surround effect.  Most TV shows, DVDs and VHS support Dolby Surround by squeezing it into the stereo signal (this is called matrixing).  I had a Pro Logic system for many years and was happy with it, but I didn't know what I was missing.      Later technology introduced Dolby Digital.  Dolby Digital was a 5.1 technology.  5 full channels (front left, front center, front right, rear right, and rear left), and a .1 (or tenth of a channel) for an optional subwoffer which only supported the low bass range for the system.  This was a major sound upgrade to the older pro logic and should be the start point for any purchases you consider.  Most major studio DVD releases support Dolby Digital 5.1, as well as cable and satellite broadcasts and this really sounds great.    In reference to a previous answer, THX is not a separate sound format, but a playback technology standard and certificaiton for receivers, speakers, monitors, etc.  You can play back a DD5.1 film on THX equipment and it will make it sound cleaner and crisper, but if your looking for a basic system, you likely won't notice much of a difference from DD5.1 alone.     Dolby Digital EX is an extension of a 5.1 system where a sixth full channel is added as a rear surround directly behind the listener.  This is referred to as DD 6.1.  The 2 previous rear surrounds are moved slightly to the rear side of the listener to create an enveloping sound field for the rear channels.    An extension to this is THX-EX which is essentially a 6.1 soundtrack played back on a THX system where 2 speakers are used for the sixth channel instead of 1.  This is a 7.1 system.  The THX processing splits the single channel into a faux dual channel creating the feeling of a wider sound field.  Some high end Dolby Digital receivers now support a 7.1 system without the THX certification using their own internal processing.     There is a new format called Dolby True HD which I don't know much about, but it is the format required for HD-DVD & Blu-Ray disks and general HD content and is encoded at much higher bit rates than the older DD signals which used more compression to save space on DVDs.    Depending upon the size of your room and how many speakers you can support, I would suggest a minimum of a 5.1 system for decent surround sound.  I'm a big movie fan so I'm bumped my system up to 7.1, but I realize it could be overkill for most people, but the best thing to do is head to a local store that has a AV room and ask the sales person to play a movie and switch to modes on the receiver for you.  Most receivers that support the newest sound modes will also play back the older pro logic basic surround modes.  Hope that helps.|`|raFYuWouaa	Pioneer , Yamaha ,Harmon-Kardon, Onkyo, are all good AV receivers and be advised that the higher the wattage the better the sound . I have a pioneer vsx-815 which is running 4 bose 501 series IV speakers with a bose center channel and two jbl subs I think my system sounds great.  My 501's are direct reflecting which bounce mid and high frequencies off the wall behind them and really bring you right into the movie or music you are watching or listening to.   all my friends are blown away when they watch a movie with me.|`|0WA6eiCoaa	I think you need to really go into different stores to listen to them yourself so you can be sure you like it.

RyvKws7Laa	LCDs are best bang-for-buck at regular prices.  Samsung LCD are the best in picture quality.  They are the ones that get used in reviews of Plasma sets (which are overall better TVs, but you pay a premium for them).  So I would go Samsung.    Sony is only worthwhile if you can get it on sale.  They are so overpriced otherwise.  Sony stopped manufacturing LCD panels.  They now buy them from Sharp.  The Sharp Aquos line uses the same panels as Sony.  Sony does add its chip and what not, but the panels on both are the same.  So between those two, I'd actually look at a Sharp and save some $$$.    Make sure to get a 120Hz LCD at the very least so you have some okay viewing of sports and action films.  LCDs are now starting to go 240Hz, but are charging a heavy premium for such (you can go Plasma with no refresh issues for less than a 240Hz LCD).|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would suggest Samsung.|`|QdK6qLjOaa	Go for the Sony Bravia.|`|iv8Saahtaa	Sony Bravia, they are the best and they are good quality
fWMat3xwaa	about a month, if you remember when you received your first bill, it was a double bill because they bill a month in advance. When the message pops up on the screen warning you that your service is about to be shut off, then you have about 4 days- which is not enough time to mail it, so you have to call it in or you can make a payment at radio shack ( instant post )  You wont have to pay all of it just what ever is past due.|`|TVNIxpVgaa	I would say that if you read the back of your payment bill it would be explained to you.

avhbT0Bfaa	Because the games can be up to 50gigs. (MGS4) How long do you think your hard drive would take to get full?  Another answer has talked about installing full games to the 360. You can install parts of the games, just like the PS3, not whole games.|`|4Pk6VNftaa	Some PS3 games do give you this choice.  Time Crisis, is one such title.  And yes, if you do let the game copy to your hard drive, it will improve the load times.      The system you propose is actually available on the 360 right now as part of the New Xbox Experience (NXE) which replaces the Dashboard (the 360's version of XMB.)    As you point out, you still need the game disc to be in the 360 when you start the game.  After that, the game plays entirely off the hard drive.  Not all games benefit from this, however.  Halo3 was already optimized to run off the DVD, and copying it to the hard drive actually causes it take longer to load from the hard drive.|`|g2CYn27naa	its not up to sony, its up to the publisher and developer to choose if they allow for installs or not. its not really a sony decision.|`|kfySwy8baa	that be so cool to do that then you wouldnt have to worry about losing the disc|`|0IMtjPOMaa	They did at first, but that could create mutliples of the same game as well as licensing issues.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	your first answerer has the answer

WLJKQjYOaa	If you a value a smartphone that is small and can live with the absence of 3G, you're going to love the BlackBerry Bold. It's smaller than the Bold in every dimension, feels comfortable in the hand and is small enough to easily tuck into a pocket, yet it packs more device memory, a higher resolution display and a better camera than the Bold. Not to shabby for a younger sibling.    You can see more details and compare prices for your decided!|`|f1pzL3Ddaa	Well, for me, the Blackberry bold is cool with the touch screen, and the internet and all, but it's got a lot of features that I wouldn't actually use that much. If it could be customized with less appliances, that would be a little bit cheaper. For other people though, they might use somethings more than I would usually use them, so for them, it might be worth it, but eventually, Blackberry, or some other company is going to make an even NEWER model, with MORE stuff that I wouldn't even really use. But, like I said, if you like cell phones with a lot of extra stuff, it would be worth it.
Xxviy63Paa	When game developers actually figure out a control scheme that people would actually use. Its motion sensors are very accurate, unfortunately they're not like the Wii where they can record exact motion, just orientation and momentum.      There's already been a lot of games that use the motion sensors. Resistance was one of the first, also Call of Duty 3, if an enemy grapples with you you shake the controller to get loose. Pretty lame but a lot of games have used it.    Several games have used the sensors for steering. Motor Storm tried it, and some other racing games. It turned out to be completely impossible to steer with the sensors and nobody tries to.    Lair was the first game to require motion-sensor control, and again, it was so difficult to do that nobody bought the game.    Some smaller games use the sensors well. High Velocity Bowling does an excellent job of it. Then there's Go sports ski and go sports skydiving, both games that you'll probably end up deleting from your hard drive.    Uncharted made good use of the sensors by using them for balance when crossing logs and stuff. That's an intuitive control and it works. I think Mirror's Edge uses them for that optionally also. Warhawk will let you steer your plane with the sensors, and it works, unfortunately using the sticks still works better so you'll get owned if you don't use the sticks as well.    The best use of the sixaxis is for balance, I think. That old little game, rub-a-dub, with the ducks in the tray of water, it worked well in that. It's ok but not competitive for flight, and utterly pointless for driving.    It has no real use in fighting games but I've thought of one possibility that might work: in a future boxing game, you could use the way you hold the controller to affect your fighter's balance, whether their weight is leaning forward, or backward, or sideways, and have that affect the speed and power of their moves.     Most of the uses of the sensors are dumb little things.

XbVhQU9laa	I would recommend the Canon Powershot SD 1100IS.  I bought this camera after having a Nikon and a Sony that were both not very good.  The SD1100 is known throughout the industry and one of the best point and shoot digital cameras available today.  I LOVE THIS CAMERA!  The photos I take have a great clarity and color to them, and the operation of the camera is very simple.  The camera has a great build quality, it feels very solid and good in my hands.  Its also a very good size.  Small enough to fit into most pockets.      Another camera to check out would be the Nikon Coolpix S550.  I have a few friends and family members that have this camera and they love it!  Good picture quality and a HUGE display screen.      ALSO - I would stay clear of the Nikon s60!  NOT a good camera, lots of tech issues and problems.  Plus it is way overpriced.    I hope this helped you and good luck with your shopping.|`|HX6JjCTyaa	I would go with Sony.I heard that Nikon s60 is not so good.|`|NOcbfa8xaa	umm idk about the other cameras but i have the nikon s60 and have had trouble with the screen freezing up :/

9pXKZ5udaa	electric gadgets are tiny little robots that live in the walls and under the sofa. they come out at night and recharge the electronics in the house so the tv and toaster works the next day. 25 is the average but smaller houses have fewer. a dog house only has two or three because there is no tv or toaster there. if you see one pretend you didn't or they will get you while you sleep.
ac53eed0ec00a2d980be53069b559e62aa	sorry, but depending on which PS2 you have, you won't get more than $25 for it (the fat is $20, the slim is $25).  and IF you have an extra controller (the console MUST come with one) an official PS2 controller is only worth $4.  and you're trading in an Xbox game with your PS2 stuff?  better do it before February 9th at GameStop because after that date, we will no longer be accepting original Xbox items for trade.  and $5 is probably about right for that game.  so maybe $35 STORE CREDIT if you're lucky.  less if you get cash.    the only way you'll get the correct answer is to ask someone at GameStop how much you'll get for it all and then do your own math.  it's not polite to ask them to do it if you're calling them.  or you could take it all to the store and have them do the trade and decide if you are happy with the number.  if you decide not to do it, you can always have them void the transaction and take your stuff elsewhere.|`|0AUTZt5Aaa	Halo 2=$5  PS2=$30  Controller=$5    Total: $40    This is what you would fetch at gamestop, but don't sell it there, try ebay because you can sell it for a higher price.

MOST Macs made in the last 10 years have a firewire port. The newest MacBook and MacBook Air do not have a firewire port and have no way to add one. USB will not work - USB is used ONLY for transferring stills from the memory card... you have already learned this.    Since you did not tell us which Mac, we have no way to advise you on which firewire cable to get. ALL miniDV tape based camcorders have a 4-pin DV port. Since we don't know which Mac you are using, we don't know if it has a firewire port - and if it has a firewire port, we have no way to know if it is a 6-pin or 9-pin firewire port.
LnYr2dLfaa	There should be a card in the game case with the registration code on it. All you need to do is to go to www.nintendo.com, select your country or region and enter the registration code (or follow the instructions on the card).|`|iuV5A9JYaa	If you purchase a Wii game and it has a code in the box go to nintendo.com and register to Club Nintendo. There is an area where you can register your products.
9mTctb7jaa	Right now consumer camcorders come in 4 varieties, Tape, Memory card, DVD and HDD.  You want the HDD kind. These are sometimes Hybrid, that is they can record either on card or disk, but they do not need the card. They use a convenient USB computer connection to download video files to a computer, or they can be connected directly to a TV set for viewing.

uctxzjIIaa	The four lights all at once is an indication of the battery level, which makes sense for it to be full sicne you just replaced them.    The fact that they blink repeatedly means that the Wiimote cannot find the Wii it is synched to anywhere nearby. Based on the rest of your story, it sounds like you got hit (at a rather unusual time) with what I call the Wii Bluetooth Glitch, where the Wii just stops talking to any Wiimotes. Fortunately, the fix for this is as simple as turning the WIi off, unplugging it from the wall for a few seconds, and then plugging it back in.

UAYzLyN4aa	If you don't subscribe to the cable service then, if the cable company is keeping things up to date, there will be no signals in that cable at all. But if there was a previous occupant in that place, and they subscribe to cable, the cable company might not disconnect the feed for a while.     If you do subscribe to the cable service - or if there is a feed in the cable "left over" from the previous tenant -  then you will need a cable box to receive anything but basic cable and a few "clear QAM" channels, which will be the local stations' digital signals.    By the way, using the feed in the cable (if it's there) without paying for it is considered "theft of services." If they catch you, the cable company can charge you back fees for all the time you were in the apartment. Criminal prosecution is also possible, though rare in cases like this (it is much more common where someone actively hooks up a cable that wasn't supposed to be hooked up, bypasses a signal block, etc.).|`|D19F6m92aa	You may have to get an antenna.  Typically rabbit ears for vhf signals 2-13 and a loop for uhf 14-99.  I am buying a second indoor antenna at radio shack for my other tv tomorrow.  20db gain.     If you are within 10 miles of the transmitter, you should be fine.
4Pk6VNftaa	You're not missing out on anything.    TV stations that are in HD are only in 720p, with only a very few doing1080i.  Even the PPV/VOD channels from cable that claim they're in 1080p use some heavy video compression, so the picture quality really isn't any better than 720p.  It's going to be decades before they move to 1080p, and you'll most likely have bought a new TV long before then anyways.    The only stuff that is in true 1080p are blu-ray discs - but you'll still get a great picture on your current TV.    Finally, you'd have to be a professional video editor to be able to discern a 1080i and 1080p picture in a side-by-side  comparison.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	If you do indeed have a true 1080i TV, it's not a massive difference no matter what anyone says.    Up close, yes you can see the scan lines moving, and tiny images like desktop icons (if you used this as a monitor) aren't as rock solid, you see some dot crawl etc.    But with movies and such, it isn't as huge as some people might say.    1080i TVs still have a resolution of 1080 lines vertical and 1920 lines horizontal.    The difference between P (progressive) and i (interlaced) is this.      A interlaced set draws the lines all even lines first, then starts back to the top, and draws all the odd lines. So at any given moment on a 1080i set, only half the lines are being drawn vs. say a progressive set.    A progressive set has to draw the image faster because it draws the picture all in one pass. Some people get caught up in the interlaced thing and say that the resolution is half, and that 720p is better.     However in the real world, that's not exactly true. It all boils down to the fact that the human eye can't always detect that any of this is happening on most material.    So bottom line, if you do have a 1080i set, you aren't missing anything huge. I prefer 1080p and it is better, but not worth making huge deal about it. If you have a 1080i set and like it, don't worry about it.    If a newer 1080p set did look that much better, you have to understand there are other factors that improve the picture as well. Every new generation of TV improves contrast, color, and other aspects of picture quality.    So that's as plain English as I can make it.|`|ceJz411maa	The 1080i is "interlaced" and the 1080p is "progressive".    Progressive is the way that a computer monitor displays an image - in true FRAMES per second. A progressive image will look better when paused and will also be more clear for fast-motion, etc...    In an interlaced image, the whole image is never really on-screen at the same time. The image is made up of 2 "fields" of video that are superimposed ("interlaced"). Each "field" contains half of the image and it refreshes very quickly, tricking your eyes into thinking it is just one image. You will notice flicker on a paused image and fast-action video will sometimes have "ghosting" effects, etc. Interlacing was done to save bandwidth when television was first invented. It is not the ideal method for displaying a video image.    A 1080p TV is more ready for the future, as interlaced images will hopefully soon be a thing of the past...
ORgTnV82aa	Resolution: The higher the better, match this with your source (DVR or DVD) player. HD is expensive, but if that's what it takes to match your source, you might wait until prices come down further. Also match the quality/price of your projector to the source and the audio equipment. If you're starting from scratch, you might buy one good piece at a time, most equipment will work at lower resolution than it's best.    Light: Measured in 'lumens", more is better, meaning you'll be able to see images clearly with a bigger focal length (projector further from screen, meaning BIGGER PICTURE). More light also helps watching stuff during the day, which matters if you don't have blackout curtains.     Brand:As with any electronic equipment, the Brand does matter, but there's no need to match the brand of your equipment. Price differences matter, but don't buy a no-name projector for more than 70% or the price of a known good brand.
TkvOfqTvaa	save it as a movie file|`|AA11629848	wmp = windows media project, save the video to wmv = windows media video.|`|15c03bf06cee5a4061edb3180eff2867aa	not familiar with such a format.. wmp or wud it be *.mswmm?  just curious.. u may have possibly saved wmmaker project file (wmmp)..  NOT the video file. A recap of the wmm vid editing process:    Step 1. Capture/Import video/pic/music  files to be used  Step 2. Edit - drag/drop files->timeline; enhance w/ effects-transition- filters & titles & music  Step 3. Vista-Publish/  XP-Finish movie (w/ rendering) - save file for youTube or share- burn to disc       It is next to impossible to finish movie editing in just one sitting, so that an edit history to return to will come in handy. Save Project is a process w/c is true for most if not all video editing app w/c is done at any point during the activity.            *.mswmm  is a file extension (NOT a video format) of saved WinMovieMaker PROJECT (wmmp), a 'work-in-progress' w/c archives links to various video/ pic/ music/etc. files digitally collected, plus the edit history at the time of save project. If the editing process cannot be finished in one session, the process can continue later starting with this *.mswmm  (wmmp)  file. Also, this allows for multiple re-edits until satisfied.        If there is no .avi or .wmv file, it would mean that Step 3- Publish/Finish Movie- save to computer was not done... meaning, no movie was created OR the editing process could have been finished, but the valid .avi or .wmv file could not be located. In Step 3, WMM allows the editor to type name of movie, destination folder & to choose the format & resolution of final muvee.        Hope you have not deleted or moved the files used in editing, just open the *.mswmm  (wmmp) file and the finished or unfinished project will re-appear for re-edit. Complete the 3rd step- Publish- save file w/ desired format/ resolution... and you're ready to test your final muvee,  then upload & share.

w4I9oj2Maa	The audio amplifier still has power that's slowly being drained off when the TV is turned off... What you are hearing is the amplifier slowly discharging the power.    There's nothing wrong with the TV set, it's just the way it is...larger, more expensive models have a muting circuit that quiets the amp when turned off, and your TV doesn't use that circuit, because it would raise the price of the TV set.

What you need to do is, backup anything on the HDD that you want to keep, and either wipe the drive or re-format it as FAT32. Since you want to use it as an external, it would be best to just make it into one giant FAT32 partition accessible from anywhere.    There is more than one kind of FAT32 filesystem, believe it or not, so I will refer you to a site that has good instructions for making sure an external is compatible with ps3.    http://www.psubuntu.com    go to the forums, I'd suggest run a search on "XMB external" and you should get some relevant posts or how-to's.

aicIZVGuaa	how much room do you have left on your hard drive that could be your problem.   edit   so you got 60gb of space right. you should ask sony this question here a link to the site      http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/...|`|AA12146249	everytime you put in a new game the ps3 does an install on the hdd some game up to 3 and 4 GB per game. an 80GB starts with about 64GB ubeable. you may need to clean out HDD get rid of some demos|`|L3aCgcbxaa	It means that your hard drive is full, an you will need to delete something, like a demo, or video, to play ratchet and clank.    The reason for this is that whenever you put a game in ur PS3 4 the first time, it copies some of the data to the had drive, to minimize loading times, for most games, if you don't install, u don't play|`|4Pk6VNftaa	There's a bug with the game's installer where it misreads your hard drive and thinks you don't have enough space on the hard drive.    The work around is to either free up more space, or download something, like a demo, to use up some space.  (about 1GB will do it.)    Stupid, stupid, stupid bug.|`|197RAFFMaa	There was an issue with this...    There is a fix... I'll try and find it...    Here: http://rcforum.us.playstation.com/rac/bo...    (post 7 is most helpful)    "This is how i got mine to play:         go to the PS3 store. Download a free demo that is over 500 megabytes. After that is downloaded, the game can be played. I know it sounds weird, but someone told me to do it, i did and it works great now. You can delete the demo after you check the game. Hope this helps!"

DTLaPE80aa	The Iphone will not start being sold by Verizon but instead Verizon has come out with its own cool device, the Blackberry Storm. My brother has the ENV2 and i Have the new platinum voyager. I love my phone. He loves his. He has problems with his sometimes though. His is alot smaller but so are the buttons. My phone offers bigger buttons. Other than that there are very little differences i can think of otherwise.
aicIZVGuaa	ask sony they have question and answer section here the link   http://playstation.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/...|`|9AR6B4ELaa	i think its because of overheating. try not to put it near a wall or on a carpet. put it in an open space. dont ever put it near an electrical item as the heat generated will overheat the ps3. put it horizontally as to let the heat diffuse through the ventilation holes at the side of the ps3. you can put it in a cabinet but you need to have space around it (about 7-10 inches).    hope this helps  pls vote me =)|`|qGWj3EVPaa	Well if you turn it off at the power point that stuffs it up and if you play it for to long it heats up and may freeze or if you move it round and bump it but if thats not the reason go and ask eb games or a gaming outlet

3CJAUyqPaa	manimal's correct - but don't worry about it - save the final project as some sort of high quality video file - the least compression - Full quality DV or Full quality HDV is great... then use iDVD or DVD Studio to render the video file and burn the blank disc with that. Both iDVD and DVD Studio also allow you to create a menu for scene section, add background art (behind the menu selections) or video and also add a soundtrack to the menuing. FinalCut is GREAT for editing, but let each application do its job... In this case iDVD and DVD Studio's jobs are to downsample the high quality DV or HDV to a standard definition VOB/VOR file for you and the menuing is fun to design.|`|0xz8mR2xaa	Standard MPEG 4 H263, also known as Xvid, is pretty compatible as most newer players have a decoder for the format.

AA10492776	The traditional Japanese term for this condition in "Mura". It literally means inconsistent. Sony has struggled for years with mura problems with their LCD TV screens. Mura produces lighter, almost cloud like areas on the screen, mostly in the corners, mostly noticeable during black screens. The problem is related to quality control. There is no fix other than to have the screen replaced and hope that the next screen will not suffer mura problems. This problem affects all screen colors as the screen allows inconsistent amounts of light to penetrate the screen, its just that its most noticeable during black screens.|`|Ur6H8gwkaa	This pops up on some LCD TVs but not plasmas.    You have a uneven backlight situation, and yes it is most noticable in dark rooms. LCDs twist and untwist to block or allow light to pass. Sometimes when a panel is out of spec, cheap, or just flawed in some way, light leakage is more noticable in the corners.    There is no fix for this. So you can live with it or return it if you are still in the return window time wise.|`|LzSj90pbaa	This is called ghosting.   There are a few things you can do.  Look behind the tv and if you see a screw in that corner, loosen it 1/2 turn.   Ghosting will come and go over time and may only be noticeable when youre watching a 4:3 source (when you have bars on the top and bottom of the picture). If you can live with it, then live with it.  Finally, you can always call up sony and have them send a tech to your house. More then likely it will be gone by the time they show up and wont do anything about it. the next day of course, it will be back. If you happen to have them over the day it shows, they will probably loosen the screws (if that doesnt solve it) they will replace the set.   Theres no guarantees that the next tv wont have the same issues sometime in its life.|`|q5TchS9jaa	It's probably just the back light. If the TV has a warranty you should try getting a refund or another one.|`|XbVhQU9laa	I have the same thing on both of the upper corners of my 32' JVC LCD.  I doubt its serious man, enjoy that 40' !

3K1QW7Oeaa	Free music is illegal!|`|pq2gFwMSaa	Downloading music is illegal.    Go download the new metallica album or The Slip (nin.com), those are free and legal|`|CI6NgZHKaa	i think the easiest way to get free music is youtube.  all you do is type in the "song name" + "download link"  for example, if your song name is "hollywood" then this is what you type:  hollywood download link  click on a video and in the description there should be a link for the free song. click on it and find the button on that page to get your free song!  it's fast and easy!  good luck!!

TmB3Fvjjaa	Yes you still have to pay.  Apple does not allow you to use 3rd party apps, like being able to download movies straight to your iPhone or setting a background for your homescreen, and if you jailbreak it you will be able to.  It is perfectly safe to jailbreak your iPhone.|`|sduv9y7yaa	it means ur hackin it|`|9WxIYtEfaa	The reason you jailbreak is so that you don't have to be with AT&T. Jailbreaking basically means that you don't have to play by Apple's rules. You can download things that make it so you can have a different homescreen and stuff like that. When you jailbreak you void your warranty. In my opinion it isn't worth it.
r4FJjEGiaa	Yes. www.discoverblackberry.com is great tutorial site. As well as just www.blackberry.com where you can get the manual as well. Have fun!

I know Limewire IS illegal|`|UZHuSOkgaa	Limewire gave me viruses too. I use Blubster. I downloaded it and keep it on my computer and haven't experienced anything negative. It works exactly the same as Limewire, when referring to how to get songs to/from your library.|`|Fq7XuMWtaa	i thnk limewire is the best choice. as 4 da album art, wen ur ipod is hooked up 2 ur computr, rite click on a song. da 1st thing dat shood pop up on da menu shood be GET INFO. clik dat & look for artwork @ da far rite of da text box. clik add & anythng saved in ur picture on ur computr can b used as album art. if u want da real picture just go 2 google images and save da pic u want n2 my picture.|`|Q0dzzgomaa	I would suggest that instead of downloading from Rhapsody, Napster or Limewire, you use the Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter from www.dvdvideosoft.com for the following reasons:    1) Sharing  - With limewire, they want you to share the songs you download and the songs you have. Now you can turn this option off, but who wants to sit there for hours siftingthrough thousands of options for the sake of a couple of songs? With the software I recommended, you don't have to share sh*t (Excuse the language)    2) Preview before you play  - With limewire, you have to start downloading the song before you can preview it. Now this might not sound like a problem to most, but for people with super fast internet connections that can download songs at the speed of light, you won't have the time to preview it before it plays because it would be on your computer before your mouse could get anywhere near that play button. Now suppose it's a virus and not the song you wanted? You see, Youtube of course lets you play the video (they don't expect you to download, so playing the video is the only thing you can do), which not only allows you to check and see whether or not it's the right song, but you can check its quality as well.     3) Virus Risks  - See, Limewire downloads from other people's computers meaning that they could've downloaded that song from anywhere. So it could potentially be a virus. But ask yourself: when was the last time you heard about Youtube having a virus? Youtube performs maintanence nearly everyday, so even if they were to get a virus, they would detect it before it could do any serious damage to the site itself.  Plus, this is Google, the masters of coding/programming. Hell, they probably made their own anti virus software to scan the videos before they're actually uploaded. You have to realize: Google is a huge company. They wouldn't let some bad computer code cooked up by an amateur hacker destroy something they paid over $1 billion for.     4) Settings  - When you download Limewire for the first time, you don't automatically start downloading music. You have to first configure what seems like thousands of unnecessary settings. These range from turning it on and off as your torrent client, to the quality, to what types of files you would like to share (why is that even there?), to settings that talk about proxies (you're probably thinking "What the hell are proxies?"). Basically, it's too much of a hassle for those of us who simply want to download a couple of songs. Well, with the software I suggested, you only do four things:  - Install  - Select the folder  - Select the quality  - Download your songs    5) Wider Variety of Music  - True enough, Limewire, Napster and those other sharing sites have a pretty large collection of songs, but when it comes down to it, Youtube is the biggest. Admit it, every song that you couldn't find on Limewire or iTunes, you could easily find on Youtube. Not only new generation songs, but songs from commercials and old/new TV Shows, 80's hits, classic rock, Def Jam Poetry, exclusive remixes, underground rap, extremely rare tracks that you thought you would never find. You're in luck especially if you listen to Hip Hop or Rock simply because of the huge amount of remixes that can be found on Youtube. Most of which can't be found on Limewire, and certainly won't be found on iTunes. But you're thinking "I don't know how to download from Youtube!" Well, now you can.       Now, for my last point (I'm almost done, stay with me), I would like to emphasize what I stated about sharing. Now even though Limewire claims to share only the folder you told it to, you have to understand the immense amount of skilled hackers there are. You see how people who have never even heard of Limewire get their computers hacked every day, and Limewire damn near provides the tools with all of this "folder sharing" business. Plus, Limewire shares your IP Address (just like torrents), which is basically the key to your internet connection. Basically, this program kicks Limewire's ***, but in case you need further proof, let's weigh the advantages and disadvantages:    Free Youtube to Mp3 Converter:    Pros:  1) Shares absolutely nothing, not even the IP Address. You're not required to share with anyone else.    2) You don't have to configure 1000's of settings as soon as you start the software (as you do with limewire). You just pick the folder you want to save it to, and then start downloading    3) No viruses.    4) Preview before you play    Cons:  n/a      Limewire:  Pros:  - You can download free music    Cons:  - Everything else    Now as I said before, this software is completely free, and can be downloaded from www.dvdvideosoft.com

XHharKJgaa	Design - LG VU, The Vu has a slimmer and more sexy design than the Incite.    Quality - LG VU, Both phones are great but since the Vu isn't a smartphone, it has fewer glitches and runs more smoothly. Both phones' touch screens need getting use to though.    Capabilities - LG INCITE, Since the Incite is a smartphone and it runs Windows Mobile 6.1, it will have the more capabilities like Microsoft Office.    Easiness To Use - TIE (maybe LG VU), As far as typing goes, both have the same virtual touch screen typing pad and look and work basically the same. Outside of typing, the Vu is the more simple phone so it is the more easy of the two to use.    Conclusion - The LG Vu is a great choice is the better one as far as value goes. Overall, the LG Vu will still probably squeeze out as the winner. Unless you'll need a phone to use for work or business, go with the Vu. If you are looking for a phone to use for business or just want a smartphone, Incite is a good phone too.      Hope I helped!
