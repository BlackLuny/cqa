I have been told by a friend of mine that head and shoulders causes hair loss.  Is this true?  Is there anything bad about using a dandruff shampoo every day?      I am currently using the Wal-Mart knockoff brand (equate) of the shampoo (active ingredient pyrithione zinc, which I believe is the same has head and shoulders), would it change anything?      Also, what are some quality alternatives to head and shoulders (just regular shampoo, not dandruff)?      Thanks for your help.

20090309192313AAkvtGx	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Will u stop wearing UGGS 2 save the poor sheep?	Will U stop buying them and wearing them???       Do u know that so many sheep have been killed that they can't keep up with demand? That’s y there sold out       Will u stop wearing them now?       Do u feel sorry 4 the sheep?       Do you have to really kill the poor sheep just to make a pair of UGG boots?    The answer is YES. The sheep has to be slaughter to obtain their hide and fleece. Now once the sheepskin hides are taken from the sheep then the process of preparing the hide for manufacturers and ensuring the hides are up to export standard begins.       Woolskins are usually preserved with salt prior to being processed by tanneries. At the tannery the skins are processed in large vessels called paddles which vary in capacity from 3000 to 15000 liters. In contrast to hide processing, in woolskin processing mechanical action is kept to a minimum in order to minimize felting of the wool. Rotating blades on the paddles move the skins slowly and gently, and processing is performed at much higher float ratios (typically 20-35 liters of water per skin) than are used in hide processing.       Typically it takes about 10 working days for the skins to be tanned and finished ready to be cut into panels for ugg bootsUGG? Australia uses only the best quality sheepskin exclusively. Twin-faced sheepskin is used in many of our core products. A piece of twin-faced sheepskin has been treated on both the fleece side, and the skin side.       The wool of genuine sheepskin is extremely dense (more-so than any synthetic), which provides for a more comfortable and durable material.       Fleece breathes, wicks moisture away, and allows air to circulate, keeping feet dry.       Sheepskin is naturally water resistant & therefore small amounts of moisture will not seep through or damage it.       UGG? Australia sheepskin is naturally thermostatic & therefore will keep bare feet warm in temperatures as low as -30°F and cool in temperatures as high as 80°F (Sheepskin will naturally insulate by keeping feet warm in the winter & cool in the summer.)       The sheep that we use have finer wool & cleaner skin (skin!

20090309193822AAXWaMX	Beauty & Style;Hair	I just got a HORRIBLE haircut, help?	Okay. My mom cut my hair yesterday. Normally she's REALLY good with my hair, but this time she cut it WAY too short. I'm twelve, but this haircut makes me look like I'm seven, as if I need any of that. It's above my shoulders. I like the STYLE but the length is just...UGH. My hair either looks good really long or really short, but in between it looks like I just hacked it off with a pair of kitchen scissors. What should I do? It gives me a headache wearing hard headbands because I have glasses, and the stretchy ones always fall off. We aren't allowed to wear hats to school either. How can I make it easier to deal with until it grows out again?      (Oh. And I'm NOT shaving my head, sorry. And I just wanted to add that I don't mean to appear like I'm complaining or taking anything for granted, because I know people with cancer have lost their hair, and I'd rather have a hideous haircut than get sick. So sorry if I offended anyone.)

20061003142324AAv8fch	Beauty & Style;Fashion & Accessories	Soon to be college grad. struggling with image?	I am a 22/m/white. I am grad. college in May and I am having a problem. To be simple, it is my image. My friends have an urban and street look to them (altough THEY ARE NOT IN GANGS OR ANY TROUBLE). My professors want me to have this choir-boy image, I'm being trained to look like a Dr. off of "ER" , and the college culture seems to be pointing me in the same direction. Before I was told I had an immature look (I wore Abercrombie and American Eagle). However, since then I have got my ears pierced and I am thinking about letting them heal up, getting a more polished, higher class look. My friends all wear baggy jeans and have diamond stud earrings. I am from a high middle class family and I feel like I would be posing if I went along with them(baggy jeans, diamond stud earrings, etc) like they wanted me to before. The thing is I hear so many people saying so many things. I hear "be yourself", "do what you want," "act your age," "dress the part," What do you think?? I'm really torn.

20090309200514AAGUvXY	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	How do you remove gel nails?	My mom and I recently got gel nails (about 3 weeks ago) and the time has come to get them filled again, although I'm not sure if I want to. They're very pretty and receive a lot of compliments, but I've found they get in the way, once they've grown a bit, when I'm playing the piano. They also seem quite dirty underneath, and I know that they are not good for your real nails.       So after that long speel, I was wondering 2 things:      1) How do the "nail people" go about removing the gel and tips? Is it painful? Do you have to pay?      2) To those who have had gel nails for a long period of time, or even to those who have recently gotten them removed after only having them for a few months - Are they worth the extra $35 for fills? What shape were your nails in when you got them removed??       Best and most thorough answers get 10 points! Thanks =)

(And i have tons of AE/aero stuff to wear to the interview)   I do not stutter when I speak and can answer any question they might ask offhand without having to ponder on it.

I am all for individuality and self-expression, but it is RIDICULOUS how much eyeliner this girl uses.  She makes racoon eyes with super thick lines on the top and lower lid-and crams it into the side creases and IMO it is way overdone.      She goes through a whole eyeliner pencil in two months.      I mentioned that she should probably go a little lighter on the eyeliner (it's a requirement for her colorguard, but she uses it multiple times-every day).  I'm not going to lock it up and just give it to her on gamedays, but she looks BAD.  It's not so much the way she applies it as it is the amount.       Any ideas on how I can make her see this isn't as much individuality as it is bad makeup application?

When i scratch them, i normally draw blood.   ive switched razors a few times, i use soap when i shave, but i rarely use moisturiser and i have sensitive skin   Does anybody have any idea whats going on? Anyone else had a problem like this? Do i need to see a doctor about it?

20080907115825AAMHxR2	Beauty & Style;Other - Beauty & Style	Ragazze... toglietemi una curiosità!! come sono?	scusate la banalità/stupidità della domanda... ma dopo che una ragazza mi ha detto "sei un ragazzo molto carino e per quanto ti conosco anche molto simpatico ma dovremmo uscire almeno una volta perchè ci conosciamo troppo poco" e quando le ho chiesto di uscire ha iniziato a non rispondermi agli sms di punto in bianco senza che abbia fatto nulla.... mi viene un dubbio... mi ha detto così solo per non "deludermi"?? (anche se avrei preferito il contrario...)      chiedo a voi che spero mi darete un opinione oggettiva senza farvi problemi dato che non mi conoscete... sulla simpatia ok, non potete... ma fisicamente come sono?? io non saprei dato che a volte vedo uomini che mi sembrano brutti e invece secondo le mie amiche sono belli... non ho la minima idea di quali siano i "canoni" che seguono le ragazze per definire la bellezza di qualcuno...      la prima foto è recente, la seconda ha qualche mese ma è l'unica che ho trovato in cui non guardassi da qualche altra parte!! ihihihihih!!       http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image...        http://img504.imageshack.us/my.php?image...       ragazze... levatemi sta curiosità dai..!! grazie!!
