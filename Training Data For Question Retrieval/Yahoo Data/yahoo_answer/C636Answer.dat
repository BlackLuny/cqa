EaHVaui2aa	dude<br>  dont worry about it girls respect dudes like you<br>  well i do anyway<br>  i think its kinda sexy actually|`|Gd6bmn5Gaa	Dang u gonna be living da michael jackson life kids kids|`|Giun40wPaa	Well firstly: That was just too long to read.<br>  Don't want to know your whole life story and all about your terrible love life. Anyway. I suggest you go on a dating site. Sorry thats the best advice I have to offer.|`|X9RzaTy7aa	You sound like a really cool person.<br>  <br>  Don't worry too much about it, it'll happen. <br>  <br>  Being shy is OK. I think most girls prefer that to some loud-mouth cocky "lad". But of course having self-belief is different and I guess it's attractive because it means you have goals and ambition, which you do...so don't be too hard on yourself man.<br>  <br>  Being overweight,honestly, that's not gonna help when it comes to meeting some girls...but be yourself. <br>  It's an awful clich√©, but it will shine through...(uh, that's so cheesy sounding, I may be sick, did I say that or am I channelling DR.Phil or something...LOL, get out of me). <br>  <br>  PS. I dont want to give you any ideas but a lot of "friends" that are girls do tend to end up as "girlfriends" .<br>  But that usually happens when you least expect it. Not when you go looking for it.<br>  Be cool. be patient, you got time.<br>  <br>  Happy 21st in advance and I look forward to reading your sports articles too.<br>  <br>  Best Wishes<br>  <br>  Terry|`|i1IE4Yztaa	I think your shyness is probably a bigger problem than your size or your hearing impairment.  I'm the same way (shy), and I have no doubt in my mind that if I was interested enough to actively pursue a dating life, I could find SOMEONE to go out with.  But you've got to learn to face rejection if you want something to happen.  <br>  <br>  Another thing . . .  I don't want to say "lower your standards," because that sounds awful, and I don't want to imply that certain types of girls wouldn't consider you.  But I think a big issue today in the dating world is that EVERYONE is looking for their ideal.  For instance, would YOU go out with a big woman who had a hearing impairment?  Try broadening your spectrum.  A lot of girls just wanna go out with a nice guy--maybe a Mr. GPS who can take them somewhere really fun.  But at the same time, those girls might not be the type of girl who would instantly catch your eye in a crowded room.|`|qtTfbjzfaa	You don't need a girlfriend, unless if you are living alone, just go and screw someone for one day or two and get back to your life.<br>  I'm an 18 guy and I don't see what people find in romance anyway, especially men<br>  It's something that you can just do and get tired of, from the looks of it|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Well no offense, so far you sound like a typical shy nerd. I say that in a nice way, I used to be one also. <br>  <br>  <br>  The first thing you will need to do is improve on your physical appearance. Sweat pants won't cut it when your looking for romance, Get some jeans or khakis. also get some polo, and button down shirts to go with them, While printed T's might be comfy, they will score you no points as everyday apparel.<br>  <br>  You said you are hearing impaired. Don't try to hide this, and don't use it as an excuse for anything. Excuses are for things to be ashamed about.<br>  <br>  Now that you got some new clothes, stop and look into the mirror. Seriously look at yourself. Is there some part of you that you can change to make yourself happy. For me I chose to lose a few lbs, and shave some unneeded hair. Yeah I could be a great ape without my Gilette. Anyway make your assessment and figure out how you are going to accomplish any goals you set for you appearance.<br>  <br>  Next buy some nice cologne, Not that over bearing highschool crap kids use, but a nice lightly scented cologne, that isn't over bearing. I chose Gucci Envy. Try it I bet everyone will like it.<br>  <br>  Now give it about 2-3 weeks and look into the mirror again, I bet you will see a whole new person, that has a lot more confidence in himself.  And this is what your after Confidence.<br>  <br>  It won't say it easy, but I promise, when you look the best you can, dress the best you can, and smell the best you can, you will have no problem with the ladies.<br>  <br>  <br>  Other things to check for are ashy elbows, acne, un wanted body hair, cracked lips, bad breath, yellow teeth, excess body fat, exc. <br>  <br>  Improve upon the outside so women can find the inside.<br>  sorry if this sounded mean it wasn't meant to be, it was however meant to be informative.|`|wNUvIhbtaa	well if you don't like the way your life is going you can change it. if you want to look attractive to girls maybe you could start a diet and reflect on how increase your self confidence. you know what? actually when i was younger and more physically "fresh" i didn't have many girls around because i was a bit insecure. then i started saying *uck it and acting like i was a god. i was an ****ole but i started having loads of girls flirting with me. it's all about confidence.<br>  but be careful. if you want a girlfriend rather than just one night stands you don't have to exceed. be humble, but with style. and get in shape!|`|Uf1P5JJ5aa	go to the gym and don't wear sweatpants, wear jeans :)|`|1836a40209adf3c11cc7c5b61284b41faa	First of all you have got to dress. Wear good jeans and shirt. Keep well groomed and shaved and take good care of your teeth.This will give you more confidence. Perhaps you should try some on line dating where you can chat and get to know the girl first and see if you have something in common. If the chemistry is good see what happens. I did not have my first real date till I was 22 but soon lost my inability to talk to girls. I found that when you enter a room always say there you are and not here I am. Always center the conversation on them, this makes  a girl feel special. If she asks you questions about yourself, then you can answer them, but try to go back to focusing on her.|`|11a003236016ddd45f2ddc918a54b603aa	I'm 26 and never had a girlfriend, (do not fret my friend). I have lots of friends that seek relationships advices from me. (but i think I'm not that helpful). <br>  If you really want to have a girlfriend, I think its a matter of personal choice, many of my guy friends had their serious girlfriend relationships when they were a little older, so it may be right to give yourself sometime. <br>  I think that its a matter of personal choice that you (we) never had a girlfriend, its not being gay or having to do with gender issues, but i think if you have chosen to have a girlfriend... i believe you will have one.|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	This is sad!! I don't know to be honest, humans work in so many complex ways. I wish I knew why and how! I was thinking why only great looking people get a lot of attention even though their personality is not so great. They say that it's personality which matters but when it comes down to it, it's not actually true! You know, I was thinking the other day, looks are necessary in this world. They have a big impact on how you are treated by others and their reactions! Even if we don't want admit it, it's true. I wish it wasn't true but i have to be true to myself and face reality so I've come to the conclusion that sadly in this world, physical appearance is importrant. Personally, I'm one of those people who looks for personality. But I'm not gonna lie and say that I don't look for physical appearance cos most of the time that's how we become interested in the first place. I wish it didn't work out this way so that everyone would have an equal chance.<br>  <br>  I would advice you to go to the gym or buy a DVD exercise workout, and go on a healthy eating plan! Honestly, after a while your appearance will improve massively. You will start losing weight, clothes will fit better, and when you look in the mirro you will see a better version of you. You will feel way more confident and you'll get many complements and find your girl. My friend, he's 29 and he feels exactly the same, so now he's on a healthy eating plan and he's lost weight. He did this because he wants a girlfriend and he's got quiet a big stomach. I think, physically he looks better. But even his personality has changed for the better cos he's more confident. I'm planning on going on a diet and exercising everyday too :)!!!|`|ba2b0c7b7d6c09abcf3a3d6bac39f5e5aa	You have your whole life ahead of you! Don't be so pessimistic, its such a turn off. Take pride in you appearance and yourself, be nice to everyone and that special someone will turn up. Have faith ;)|`|CX1tpaGZaa	dont worry about it, <br>  Happy Birthday!|`|Qks0PQhAaa	you have to catch everything life throws at you because if you don't you will always wonder if you should have took it or not,and as for you saying your big never change yourself unless you do it for you never do it for somebody else,if you are happy the way you are then you have to find a girl that will also apprecitate you for you,people that end up single for ages always think its them selves that's the problem but its not,i have a male friend that loves himself he knows hes attractive and is up himself and he cant get a girl because no woman wants an overly confident man that thinks hes above himself so be yourself get some confidence you will attract a girl alot quicker that way :) ow and wearing a pair of jeans isnt gonna make a difference trust me a girls not gonna fall in love with your jeans is she lol x|`|wE2etBzbaa	You need to step up and enter their area..  only guys who bust in girls' personal space can get laid,   or if you are a model guy, but you are not, so try to defeat your shyness and put on your gears and start kicking doors (not literally).   you obviously shy seems or one of those guys who stay behind when comes to flirting and showing interest.   let the balls speak.
f0ZqPrtxaa	You are barely 20 and there is a lot of time left for you.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	u really don't have to agree to the abortion, as for being 15, and running away, i don't know the laws in fla. and your dad would probably make u come home.best to tell him u don't want the abortion.best to deal with your dad first.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Even if you are under 16 and pregnant, it is up to a judge if they will grant you a marriage license. It isn't a guarantee. It would be rare for a license to be granted to a runaway unless she could show proof that she had been abused at home or living in an unsafe environment.  However, if you are not a Florida resident it will not apply to you - it is only for legal residents of the state. <br>  <br>  You also don't mention how old he is. If he's 18 or older, he could be prosecuted for statutory rape if you present a judge with proof of pregnancy. <br>  <br>  Why not just give the baby up for adoption. You are too young for marriage and are rushing into it for the wrong reasons|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	Your Dad is right, and wrong.  Right if this guy isn't going to be around for the long haul, wrong if you two can make this tragedy work.<br>  <br>  I dunno the law where you are, but your BF sounds like a sicko, getting you preggo at that age, man, he has done a few before you, hasn't he.<br>  <br>  Nobody can force you to be divorced, unless maybe the marriage was unlawful in some way?, but there may be legal precedents which compel you to put the child in foster care, or put BF in jail?  The judgement may use the laws from where this event occurred.<br>  <br>  Someone should go around and sew those things shut, and have them opened again when you are mature enough to judge people better.<br>  <br>  So, disrespecting parents is fun, makes you feel powerful, independent, but you will spew blood later when you find out they were only looking out for you, and you screwed it all up.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	I would say research Florida law and make sure that you can get married with a doctors note.  I would also contact Planned Parenthood and ask to speak to an advocate, someone that can help you find out what your dad can and cannot make you do. You can also contact Child Services in your city, but then your at risk of being removed from your home, but you will be able to keep your baby.  Sounds like you made a huge mistake without thinking of the consequences, and you have to be a big girl even if it mean fighting your dad to the end.|`|AA11683646	Please excuse me but you seem to be exhibiting lots of moral indignation regarding abortion but you have no problem with running away and marriage at 15.<br>  <br>  Get the abortion and clean up your life.<br>  Your father knows best.<br>  <br>  As for the abortion is murder crowd, that is their opinion and does not help your situation now.<br>  <br>  This could have been avoided had you exhibited the slightest responsibility in the first place and used protection.<br>  <br>  There is no way you will be able to raise a child.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	You are too young for marriage and motherhood.  You are a child yourself.  My kids are your age.  I do not agree with the abortion, but adoption would be great in your case.  See if he will consider not murdering your baby, but letting you find a married, adult couple who would love your child.  Seriously, that would be the greatest act of love for yourself and your child - adoption!|`|IwDtJFy0aa	Do not runaway make you dad realize that abortion is murder

You have to be cruel to be kind....<br>  xx|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Yes you could ignore him, but think how you would feel in reverse.  It would be kinder to talk to him.  Tell him that your friendship is not a relationship in the boyfriend girlfriend sense and that you don't want him to be confused over this issue.  You are more than happy to chat and hang around with him at college but you are do not want to date him.  If he pushes you tell him that you see him as a friend and nothing else.|`|HEQc83d9aa	owch! this one will hurt him no matter which way you choose to do it, you must tell him gently, just say I am not attracted to you in the way you would like me to be;but I am attracted to you as a good friend. Never tell him you are sorry for the way you feel as it sounds patronizing . But you must tell the chap as it is stopping him from finding a lass who wants to be more than friends. xx|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	Tell him flat out, you are not interested in him romantically.  <br>  <br>  If he can't take the hint, contact campus police and file a report.  <br>  <br>  Buy some pepper spray and learn how to do a groin pull twist and run.|`|HPRFtBAsaa	Hello there<br>  <br>  try to face this one head on and it will be done and dusted then, you won't have to worry about it.<br>  <br>  Ask to speak to this person alone, thank them for their valentines card, but explain that you just don't feel any chemistry so nothing could ever happen between you.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise, this chap could be unsure for ages, and If he keeps making moves on you it could make you feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  If he has been nice enough to give you a card, this is the least you can do.  Ignoring people can really knock their self esteem.  Unless if this chap has been harassing you, in which case still be upfront, and then ignore him.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  Caroline|`|AA11064112	Jessy,<br>  <br>  There is no way you are not going to hurt this person because you don't' love him. So tell him so that he can move on even if he will get hurt, but know that time is a healer and he will get over it. A man should always state their feeling to a lady by direct proposal and he has not done that, so tell him you regard him as a friend and not a lover and you include that you look at him as your own brother. Don't worry, he will get over it!|`|y3I25s4Baa	Its better you tell him that you do not see him in that manner, but you like him as a casual friend. so if he can continue in that manner its better! or put a full stop to it. if you do not tell him, you will start loosing your peace and space, so instead of ignoring, tell him the fact in calm way, which may sort out things!|`|wNUvIhbtaa	just tell the truth. it might hurt him but what doesn't kill us makes us stronger. if he's mature enough he will understand and will start hanging out with you as friends. otherwise you just have to stop seeing him at all.
tBaCFTtBaa	omg, no.  good luck!|`|mDMnhqwdaa	No, chances are she'll cheat on you again..and if you get married you'll be trapped you can't just leave..you have to through the whole divorce thing. Wait and take your time, and see if she changes.|`|4qT0TfMZaa	Only if you're an April Fool!|`|Midbg5BJaa	Do not propose- a proposal means you are certain you want to spend the rest of your life with her- you don't sound like you do quite frankly...|`|zt0wLQzVaa	what the hell, ur gf is a slutty whore lol. it would be very very stupid to propose to a ***** like her =D|`|9WR2lKBtaa	She's not 'the one' if she cheated, no matter what she says now.<br>  <br>  You can't be 100% sure the baby is yours until it's born.<br>  <br>  The distance may have been a problem, but her faithfulness shouldn't be affected by that if she truly loves you. If she has to satisfy her sex drive, there are other ways of doing so besides cheating.<br>  <br>  You can never trust her when it comes to cheating (or anything, for that matter) again. If she convinced you to forgive her this time, she'll just do it again if she wants because she knows she can get away with it.<br>  <br>  No, you should not propose.|`|o8o689x5aa	My advise, from experience, is once a cheater, always a cheater. Do not marry this girl. If you do, you are setting yourself up for profound and periodic heartbreak. The question you need to ask yourself is, do you need that?|`|1jIzBUkhaa	oh no, don't propose, she was not true to you. if she did it ones on you she will do it again and again.  if i was you I would dump her.don't mess up your life for her.she lie the hole time.|`|MIT5tAXEaa	I'm sorry man but I am speechless. In a bad way.<br>  <br>  If you really love her, and she had made a mistake ONCE let it slide. If it happens again, be MUCH more harsh.|`|vmzHbRt2aa	don't waste your marriage life for a cheating person.<br>  you deserve someone better....|`|2BceQT7waa	Do you really need all that drama in your life? You can spend a lot of time making excuses for her, but the fact is she has treated you unkindly and disrespectfully. Why would you think, even for a second, that she's suddenly going to change her ways? Why settle for someone who's going to treat you like dirt? Dump her, and start looking for someone who can be trusted.|`|3iRDJxL5aa	hmmm.....toughie......the best thing to do is just let her got, but obviously youre not because feelings and love are involved. My suggestion would be not to propose just yet..wait a while see if she does it again, my last words: if she did it once she'll do it again and again, theres no such thing as being faithful, is just knowing how to play the game and not get caught|`|820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	I wouldn't trust her. If you love her, then give her another chance, but until you can be 100% sure that you can trust her then I would not propose to her. <br>  <br>  I really do suggest holding off on the idea of having a baby. A child needs a stable family unit, which it does not sound like you can provide at the moment. You can't have a long distance family. If you got married, who would move? I would suggest moving in together first (since you're already sleeping together), see how that goes, then propose. When married (or at the very least, living together, settled) try for a baby. What if she cheated again, and was pregnant with your child? You'd be paying custody for the child, but wouldn't trust her!

But guess what someone has to do it. Is it right for your mother to have to clean yours???? <br>  <br>  <br>  Talking back isn't a problem, I think everyone should voice their opinion, However most 15 year olds I know, scream and just want to argue. Try having a reasonable conversation, with her instead of tantrums. Voice your views, opinions, alternative solutions to problems, and be constructive.<br>  <br>  In other words, she is teaching you character, you should have to clean your room, be respectful to your parents, and still stay out of trouble. Being a child is not a negotiation, the standard has been set now either live up to it, or take your moms hurtful words till your 18 and get out.<br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if I sounded mean, but thats the way the world is dear, If you beleive it is unfair then change the rules with your kids.|`|zIiMnM8iaa	sorry, i don't no wat to do...

The only thing you can really do here is just try talking to your mom.  I'm guessing that you already have, though, and got nowhere.  If that's the case, you have two options.<br>  <br>  You can:  A)  Bring the rebellion to a whole new level and go absolutely insane to show just how bad you COULD be...<br>  <br>  Or... <br>                 B) Bite your tongue for a few more years until you're old enough to move out on your own and set your own rules and standards.<br>  <br>  I would suggest trying to be a peaceful as possible with your mom.  I'm sure she's only hard on you because she loves you... but you're also right by saying that you're an angel compared to most teenage girls.  From the sounds of things, you're not a whore, druggie, rebel, or loser of any kind.  <br>  <br>  I commend you.  And good luck with this.  Hopefully I've helped a little.

hra6zIvQaa	Hello Jobson<br>  <br>  There are so many so called solutions to marriages and relationships in crisis, and yes, financial troubles do put relationships into crisis.<br>  <br>  Your question about the root cause of high rates of relationship failure caught my attention - you have obviously been thinking about this.<br>  <br>  Interestingly, there is a root cause for all things in our world, that stems from the spiritual worlds, and divorce is one of them.<br>  <br>  I have found an article that explains that the real reason behind this problem is our ego. The fact that when a couple first get together, they laugh and have fun, go to movies and the beach etc. When they marry, all is good. But then at some stage, the ego gets involved . . . (from the article) "They suddenly begin arguing. Then they begin taking advantage of each other and making private calculations, such as "How can I get him/her to be the way I want them to be?"" . . . <a href="http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/life-love-family/kabbalah-relationships?p_options=1#what-does-the-story-of-adam-and-eve-mean-in-our-times-3f" rel="nofollow">http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/life-lov...</a><br>  <br>  And a short humorous video about our ego: <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZZzUYIKAU&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iRZZzUYIK...</a><br>  <br>  I do hope this helps answer your question<br>  <br>  Shalom<br>  Mem

I'm assuming that you're 2 children are still young, so you want someone who welcomes them into their life too. <br>  <br>  Stay friends with him if you want, but I would not get your hopes too high about this guy, it sounds like he's using you.|`|HYVIOCPRaa	For my opinion, I think you should be honest with him..

1nN3v4foaa	If you don't want to have sex with a guy, does that mean the only reason is because he's ugly?  No, I don't think so.  You two must not be bf n gf.  Count your blessing that he didn't just do you just for the sake of it.  That would hurt even more, believe me.  Nothing worse then giving it to them and having them not know you the next day.|`|fc9d4ARVaa	Don't have sex. Don't have sex. Don't have sex. Wait, have some dignity. All you need to feel is thankful that you didn't lose your respect on some d*ck like that. Wait for someone you really love and that loves you back.<br>  He probably didn't want to have sex with you because virgins tend to look for mushy relationships when, indeed, he just wants sex. He doesn't want the relationship, so he has to reject you. Don't feel low on yourself, I'm sure you're pretty. I'm also a virgin and I've never had a boyfriend either. I don't want one anytime soon anyway, I'm 14. 14 year-olds with boyfriend problems piss me off.|`|uMe0uW0Saa	Some guys don't like virgins because they may seem clingy.  You wouldn't want to be with a guy like that anyways, or the guy who rejected you.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  We haven't seen you or know you.  Just be more confident, that will be more attractive.
QareyZKfaa	I say to be natural.  If your natural feelings dictate that you want to be with her, then you should not have to hide that.  However, she is in a relationship so I would TEMPER your feelings, but not hide them.  I don't know the situation and won't pretend to, but I can say that if she were to leave him for you, there's a reason for it.  A reason that SHE saw, mind you.  <br>  <br>  My advice is this:  Be natural.  Be yourself.  Let things flow.  If something feels right for you, go with it.  If it feels unnatural, don't.  When dealing with matters of the heart or anything like it, its unlike anything else in the fact that it has a natural... chaotic order to it.|`|bhc5iwfnaa	ahhhh...dude wake up and smell the coffee!!!!!!!!!!! shes already made her decision!! if she wanted to be with you she wouldnt be with that other guy!!!<br>  the best thing to do is for you to befriend her...at the very least you'll both have a good m8! but do not try and come in between her and the guy....coz that my friend is low!|`|r7GMWkPraa	it's wrong, and it's also really creepy.<br>  sorry you've been friend-zoned, dude.|`|RrduEmSiaa	It's wrong.

All is fair in love & war.<br>  I wooed my wife away from the man she was engaged to because I knew in my heart that she was The One For Me.<br>  <br>  I quite simply loved her.<br>  <br>  I barely knew her. She comes from another country, and other culture and was engaged to a man from her country of her nationality & race.<br>  There was absolutely no logic behind my decision to pursue her and, quite frankly, everyone who knew me told me I was insane.<br>  <br>  Oh and the guy was quite wealthy, and I was not. He was a top level government guy and I was a dope smoking HS drop out. (She was getting her Master's Degree here in the states.)<br>  <br>  But fate and destiny won the day, and now 21 years later we're still happily married.<br>  As someone answered, she had made her decision, but I contend that it was a wrong one. She must have agreed. <br>  She's now getting her Doctorate, I'm a successful businessman (and a former doper). We have no kids and we love the Lord.<br>  Your mileage may vary.|`|oMna3EOnaa	if shes willing to leave him then its not your fault she wasnt happy.|`|wE2etBzbaa	It's wrong if you put a lot of efforts. but remember other men are doing the same to your girlfriend.  so why you have to be restrained.  though it is unethical still.    but in anyway, the man will be happy to get rid of cheating girlfriend . if she turns out to be so.|`|0ox8VKwKaa	If shes wooable then go for it. He is just a bf. Just be completely upfront and honest with everyone involved as needed. You don't want someone to woo her away from you.|`|oH68ltZJaa	yeah it is wrong on your part, i hope that every girlfriend you get, or boyfriend you get will be stolen away from you. she is off limits. how the hell you going to down talk another man? get a life and a dog!|`|ZDFP11leaa	Sorry to say but it is wrong.

q1Ty3nk6aa	Well, I was going to suggest going out for a drink, but you're far too young for that so... <br>  <br>  Try and do something which takes the pressure off. If you're somewhere and it's quiet, you not talking is going to be more awkward than if you're somewhere where the lack of speak isn't so noticable.<br>  <br>  Do something interesting, come up with some weird suggestions of things you want to do on dates and then just do them. I mean stuff like this, <a href="http://imsorrywhat.tumblr.com/post/64295930/the-current-top-date-ideas," rel="nofollow">http://imsorrywhat.tumblr.com/post/64295...</a> not smut.<br>  <br>  Get a question/answer thing going. As in 'ask me anything.' and then you answer as honestly as possible and then ask her something.<br>  <br>  Good luck though, you seem like a decent guy, so I hope things improve for you :]|`|Z51fjE2Raa	Just trust yourself, and trust her...

EZKe92TTaa	First of all you were brave to take the risk and ask him. You could have risked the friendship. He was honest, and still wants to remain friends. You have to decide if you can be around him while having strong feelings for  him or not. You may need a little break while you tend to your broken heart. But explain this to him. I'm sure time will heal and you will be able to go back to being friends again even though you will have a special place in your heart for him. But accept it, and keep yourself busy with other friends and activities.|`|isOU71uIaa	That's happened to me before. You should just act normally around him, as if nothing happened because otherwise you will never be able to be around him without feeling awkward. If you act normally around him and just slowly get closer to him (make your friendship grow stronger) then try again after a couple of months or so it could work out, he might feel as if he doesn't know you enough or just not know how he feels about you yet. Just give it some time and then try again, it might turn out better next time.|`|0mXQODsIaa	are you alright? i dunno wats up with him. just act normal i guess. dont let him take advantage of you though. im sorry|`|oTrfvK9iaa	you should ******* kick his ******* *** if he doesnt do what you want|`|EgUxu5kjaa	aww, dont worry..<br>  give it some time..<br>  slowly bring up the subject and tell him how you really feel.|`|1XIzubPYaa	Dont feel sad.

YsDwo7Dqaa	How positive are you that the notes were about you, this could be a miss understanding. In my opinon most chicks are like this (no offence) they try to be someone they are not around there friends, this 'Jas' girl prob is your friend and really opened up to you on the weekend but then when she is around 'Sal' she might want to act 'cooler' or something like that.<br>  <br>  Maybe try to get 'Jas' alone and confront her on the issues otherwise she wasn't a very good friend in the begining.<br>  <br>  But the direct answer to your question is No, if Jas is backstabbing you then she isn't a real true friend.|`|QBFbvO21aa	i think Jas is a people pleaser. <br>  like she totally kisses everyones ***.<br>  not saying she's a bad friend..<br>  but she tries so hard to be EVERYONES friend you know.<br>  wich means hurting alot of people in someway.<br>  like im sure she totally likes you but if "sal" comes around<br>  and doesn't like u or is jealous like u say...then Jas probly says things just to go along with her.<br>  i've known so many friends like this. :/|`|4vUcsutAaa	I think you should take Jas aside and ask her what this is all about. If her answer isn't satisfactory, then don't let it go. There is obviously something going on, and I think its important to know who your real friends are.       Good Luck!|`|hHIFCgbTaa	Sounds like "Jas" is riding the fence,<br>  saying one thing to you and another to "Sal".<br>  Call her on it.|`|4rmvGTNBaa	sounds like sal is a bit of a cow. She has probably been bad mouthing you off to jas,.Talk to your friends jas and explaing things your way and she will understand|`|JauAJKI1aa	if she was your friend she would have nothing to hide from u about the note!<br>   but now u know how sal would feel if she knew u where talking about her. so truly all 3 of u r at fault here.|`|rMmSjJ18aa	tell "sal" that jaz doesnt like her neither|`|WvUy2FwWaa	ask her why she did what she did and if she has a good reason then maybe you could try a be friends again but if she keeps on be mean about you behind your back then she is not a true friend|`|GdlwyXtTaa	Well, I think Jas is double sided. Maybe she wants Sal to stop teasing her so maybe she aint her real friend. And since you are close with Jas, she would know being a friend of Sal would be wrong. Sal is the worst friend to have. But one thing is that, friends never lie to each other. And at the end, when you said "i told them i saw the note they got all worried and refused to show it to me." i think there might be a reason that Jas got all worried. Maybe her plan was to kind of 'befriend' Sal. And she didnt want you to know about it. So she got worried that her plan might go wrong. It's actually up to you to see if she is Jas is your friend or not. Think wisely. Because friends are very important in the future. They can help in many ways and help you surpass obstacles that you cant pass alone. Think wisely. All up to you. Keep her and maybe have an easier life, or if you dont keep her, you might have a harder life.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	No Jas isn't a friend if she saying those things.  <br>  She is using you to get information and you walked into it.<br>  So I would suggest avoiding both, at least you know Sal isn't <br>  someone you want as a friend you only have to dump Jas.<br>  The sooner the better.|`|ewIELhBiaa	Do you really have to ask this question or are you simply looking comfirmation. It's a classic set up Jas came over to set you up to talk about Sal and you did what they wanted find a couple new freinds and move on.|`|dwtwFWc6aa	no... mabey you should talk to her??? some people like all the attention they can get... see some people like to 'hang out' with those people who normally take advantage of them , i dont why, but she probablly told her everything that you two discussed about Sal. if you hadnt told them that you had seen the note, Jas would have still pretended to talk to you, when she needs to!!! dont waste your time with people like her, come on, if shes b***hing about you why would you chose to even bother with them.|`|Mr8YpNOSaa	Tbh i dont really think anyone could answer this for you, all i will say is talk to her and ask her what her problem is and if she seems to be lieing or your still in doubt then she obv doesnt want to tell you something for some reason. It really is something you would have to sort out yourself|`|CFFxtileaa	It was wrong of you to say to Sal that Jas doesn't like her, try to remember not to do it again,<br>  <br>  Now about your worries, This doesn't sound very nice, Jas lying to you then saying different things to other people. You need to get her and ask her quietly if you really are invited to her birthday get together, She has to tell the truth and can't say different things to different people.<br>  <br>  But you have to remember that she might be nervous about hurting peoples feelings, therefore she might've said to Sal that you're not coming t reassure her, I'm not saying this is the right thing to do, as it is very wrong, but before you jump to conclusions, you need to know the whole story, for example, you still don't know for SURE if those notes were about you. <br>  <br>  I suggest having a chat with Jas, what she did was wrong and not nice and you need to tell her how you feel about it, ask her what it's all about and find out the whole story.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope it all turns out ok<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Jas told you a secret, and you sort of betrayed her trust with that secret and told Sal that Jas doesn't like her! I know you had your reasons but it was still very wrong, and this might've triggered the 'bitching' about you. (If it was about you). Sal most probably went and told Jas what you said and Jas quite obviously wouldn't say 'Oh yes it's true' so she had to defend herself in some way, therefore she started 'bitching' about you. (If it was you they were talking about). She might be upset with you for telling her secrets or she might just be defending herself. Have a talk with her, without Sal there, and I'm sure it will turn out fine.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|e9JRcA35aa	Hey you have my name!! that's pretty cool lol.  Anyway, Girls do that crap. I'm assuming your in high school or something, right? It's gonna happen and you should probably just lose the people who treat you like that. It sounds like she is backstabbing you and I would just try to distance myself from her if I were you. Friends like that just bog you down. As you get older that type of thing will go away, but not completely :( . You'll make friends who are true to their word, care about you, and are there for you no matter what as long as you can return the favor. It just takes people a while to mature.

bEVhDE9Raa	its not your looks thats a turn-off, its the fact your so insecure your asking people who have never met you to judge you.|`|4BE2ZSdZaa	well im 15, too be honest it depends on your personality as well but for looks you sound good but a little small for me since im already 5 foot 8. maybe if you were taller not sure about style though im not really into skaters sorry lol|`|dkzsbUy9aa	dude, dont go asking on the internet.<br>  <br>  Everybody has atleast someone else alive who is perfect for them making an amazing relationship.<br>  <br>  Im sure a girl will come around soon, good luck|`|NPhepcBkaa	Why not? =]<br>  <br>  Mine? <a href="http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ap49wWn.zlZvDpW2XIIL8fbg5gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220034127AAjABr2">http://au.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	You sound awesome dude !!!|`|QGuxbItCaa	Your style sucks.|`|mNqNqKrIaa	you're okay, the only thing that turn me off is your style, but it's not a big deal, some girls like skaters, but you are honest, which is good.|`|MRODFWgmaa	The labels gotta gooooo <br>  If you're skater you'd were  matix, krew, enjoi <br>  you know legit clothes but the rest of you sounds good:]<br>  <br>  <3|`|ZPeeVckFaa	lol not an easy question without a picture, but by your description you sound hot :) there must be a reason that you are asking though...|`|8Z4oUodBaa	You sound exactly like the type of guy i would go for actually! I would definately date you! (:  xx|`|AaFxOeoJaa	To be honest, I find you from your description really attractive!<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.<br>  <br>  Katy<br>  xox|`|TyQsGapmaa	Maybe if your hung like a pony.|`|9MdBQC8baa	Ughh It was dealable until you said Scater<br>  I hate them..all they do is go around saying "Dude lets hit the boards!"|`|85KL0eUUaa	just the chubby cheeks. but yeah if you lost 5lb it should go (im not saying your fat. and if you are already slim that shouldnt be much)<br>  and as long as your hair is at least 1" long its OK. acne isnt too bad as long as it isnt overpowering. coz face it. every teenager gets it. well, most do.<br>  oh and the fact you're either only my height or a little shorter. i'm 172cm tall. which is like 5'7.5" but seeing as the avg 16yr old is about 5'4 that shouldnt be a problem to most people.<br>  <br>  i have the same style too xD|`|Tbm42g0Daa	no there is nothing about your description that should turn anyone off<br>  <br>  and it should be your personality which counts after all|`|Wl2NcRUWaa	maybe...if u give your pic would be better..
Z51fjE2Raa	The first one- cos he will be sexually appealed by a child. <br>  <br>  If she was 16 but looked 25 then it is an easy mistake to make... and he is sexually appealed by an adults appearance.|`|49NQJg2Baa	DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!...<br>   guy liking a girl that looks like 25 but is actually 16 years old IS WEIRDER.|`|19TSkwaKaa	Its okay for her to look 16...<br>  You dont really change that much in 9 years when youre older so its not that bad...<br>  But like someone who is actually 16...Thats quite bad.|`|f87ef1c5d459948a29d8431faf2a6a95aa	well i don't know that weird matters as much as LEGAL. though i've seen 25 yearolds that both look and behave younger than some 16 yearolds...and in theory, the 16 yearold would make a better girl friend, the law doesn't give a $h!t.|`|wE2etBzbaa	No, it does not matter in both cases.<br>  <br>  it is not creepy to love and/or have sex with a girl who looks 16 or guy who looks 16 if they are above 18.    <br>  <br>  the problem with sex with younger than 18, it is they are not mature legally, not because they look short or small<br>  <br>  Edit, <br>  I re-read your question,  it is illegal for a guy above the consent age to love a girl under the consent age, so that is creepy, the other not, the look does not matter|`|nEI6QyZIaa	i'd say it would be weirder for him to like a younger woman who looks older...<br>  <br>  then again, only her actual age really matters, whether she looks older or younger than she is isn't really relevant... although i find it a little odd when the woman is considerably older than the guy.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AkDnUDxgQ2RfuGONGMHKE0rsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219154917AAVDuLE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  answer mine plz? :D<br>  <br>  xxxxxxxxx|`|dkzsbUy9aa	Does age and age of how they look really matter.<br>  <br>  I mean, as long as they are over 16 then its fine, if they look older or younger than there real age it doesnt matter, its liking them which matters nothing to do with age|`|r7GMWkPraa	i don't know. any 25 year old who goes for a girl who isn't even legal yet is probably a total loser and doesn't have very good social skills. that's why he's trolling for high school chicks.
0zWJlNi1aa	i really dislike lauren - she makes me want to throw the telly out the window - the way she talks drives me up the wall|`|ktRoqxXRaa	i saw that last night<br>  tbh probably not, but i hate anita anyway, so patronising and fake<br>  <br>  newt needs a much prettier girl with more charisma then anita and lauren.<br>  <br>  although i hope he stays friends with lauren, they understand eachother :)
Qk58nIWCaa	I have been best mates with a guy for the past 7/8 years now. We have gone through absolutely everything together.<br>  It wasn't a secret that he had always fancied me from the start. As a couple of years past we got closer and closer, and without asking each other out we had a sort of "more than friends, less than lovers" thing going on for a while. We didn't see other people, went on dates and spent most of our time together.<br>  It was great, because we were such close friends in the first place we were totally comfortable around each other. Unfortunately I started to loose that special feeling for him and realised I was starting to see him as just my best friend again. So we slowed to a stop and cut out all the boyfriend/girlfriend stuff.<br>  It did throw us off course for a little bit. Mainly with him just trying to get over it and get used to friend status again. But now, years on, we are closer than ever. Like I said, we have been through most things together, we have a very special connection now and even though he had to try really hard to adjust to seeing me with my new boyfriend a few years down the line. We are so close, and have such a bond, it works :)|`|8g0moRonaa	Yes I would date them and if the relationship worked and the chemistry is there, then I think you both would benefit greatly. I did that,it lasted 17 years and it was fantastic with her before she left me for an old guy with hideous amounts of money .|`|15xdNe2gaa	well you have to be willing to take a chance with the relationship if you want it to go to the next level take the flirting/hints one step at a time and see if his emotions for you grow or stay the same <br>  <br>  -get your man ! lol<br>  -hope i helped|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i did have few crushes back when i was in high school but i kept it in me because i don't want to ruin our friendship. until now, we all still good friends.|`|RrduEmSiaa	It will most likely ruin the friendship if the dating doesn't work out. I wouldn't risk it if you value the friendship.|`|1SXHrlrQaa	No they are all in realationships or other women, just not my cup of tea.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	No I don't. But if I did have a friend who I wanted to date, I'd just go for it! So what if it doesn't work out and you lose a friend? You only live once! :)|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	I think he'd probably turn me down, and my wife would be most unimpressed.|`|qKY3GZEJaa	i did have a really good friend , i chose to take a risk and ask him out weve now bin 2gether 6months and its still going well and  if it does end we both know we will still be good mates after because were both stronger than to back down , :)<br>  i love him and hope it last so yes i would date my best mate x|`|lIO4uiJmaa	well you have to think that if it didn't work out, you would lose them permanently as a friend.  You dont say how old you are, but I guess you are only in your teens, so the  relationship would only be short-term anyway.  Do you really want to lose a friend for a few weeks of dating ?|`|EgUxu5kjaa	i wouldnt date a really good friend..<br>  one of my good friends asked me out (we're pretty close..he comes over for dinner alot) but i said no cos i think it'd ruin the friendship..<br>  and plus, i dont like him in that way..|`|d5169433fecfef522e3f23edcf9769d8aa	I was in such a situation, I chose to date them and it ruined our friendship. But I don't regret it.

Are a complete asshat.<br>  3. Cyber stalk<br>  4. Wants free porn pics<br>  5. Sends free porn pics<br>  6. Chatting in teen rooms claiming to be a teen, when your actually 50<br>  7.

I'll adopt. <br>  <br>  I don't need a man to make me feel loved that's what pets are for.<br>  <br>  I don't need a man to make me feel whole and complete- I am whole and complete I am a human being after all... I have my own mind, my own soul... I don't need to rid half my opinions to fit in accordance with someone else.<br>  <br>  I love classical music, I love traveling, I like having money and being able to not worry about financial issues... even though I don't like spending :P - WHERE ON EARTH DOES A MAN FIT INTO THAT? <br>  <br>  At 18 years old- sure people could tell me I am naive... but from what I've learnt from my parents... and their failing relationship, and the ones afterwards... it is just not worth it. <br>  <br>  I'll have friends who are guys.

I said myself that you'd be my type of guy if the "These days women are a bunch of using sl*ts." hadn't come up.<br>  <br>  Women don't hate you, you seem to hate women.<br>  <br>  I get that you *really* like money, and therefore you don't want to spend it in a relationship, but money can't make you as happy as the love of another person. Money is an inanimate object. It doesn't choose to be with you. It doesn't show you affection. You don't have to shell out for everything when you're in a relationship 'cause it's all about comprimise. If it really bothers you, go dutch! Just stop claiming other people are doing you wrong when in fact you are your own problem!|`|97sKOWQ0aa	The last sentence is why.<br>  You said "Money is very important to me, more than my family and friends."<br>  <br>  That is sad.<br>  <br>  Love Lasts.<br>  Money is just paper.<br>  <br>  I am not a slut.<br>  I am not mad at you.<br>  Really i do feel sorry for you .<br>  <br>  One thing i will give you credit for is you are honest.|`|aetIlclPaa	Probably because you've asked this question 4 times in the past 2 hours.|`|QW9AmYDraa	wow you call women shallow? i bet you here that word alot. you are a very shallow man.|`|49NQJg2Baa	well, there is nothing wrong with liking your money, but its just that was is too much,over the top,u like money more than family friendds and girlfriends, well I MYSELF wouldnt go for a man like that even though i dont care aout money( my nickname is MONEY-HATER) and i claerly see why they hate you.AND JUST TO TELL U, NOT ALL WOMEN R SL*UTS, SO CONTROL THAT MOUTH.|`|RNNdRHrMaa	Well, in the monetary department, you seem to be sorted.<br>  Have you though that is might be your obsession with cash that makes women feel the way they do about you.<br>  <br>  I have worked hard for everything I have, my house (mortgage at 19), my posessions (most recently I SAVED for my Wii), I don't have credit cards, and am not financially stable but coping and paying my bills on time. Oh and feeding my two year old daughter.<br>  <br>  We aren't all sl*ts and most of us do have morals. You just need to find the right woman, and unfortunately you have to wade through the counterfeits to find he genuine article.<br>  <br>  How would you feel if I woman you were on a date with, said she will pay 50/50 for the day with you. As she has earned her hard earned cash and is spending it only on herself.<br>  <br>  A little romance goes a long way on the right person.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck in your quest ;-)|`|nnsuWIVYaa	WOW!!<br>  <br>  Sounds like your the one with the dislike towards females. Respect is given in order to receive.  Try it sometime.  Starting with your rude description of woman.  <br>  <br>  Money!   How about family, try that word out.  <br>  <br>  You don't sound like a kind caring person sorry.  But I still wish you will.<br>  <br>  Good luck in life...

mvrygTYTaa	It sounds like you are exhausted. If you want to make this relationship work than you should discuss this with him and seek counciling. However, if you don't care if it works out or not, then it is time to move on. I know it can be difficult in your situation, but you need to get things ready and be fair to him to. Allow him to see the child and be willing to bend to accommodate him in the separation, but make him understand that you are finished as painful as it may be, if you aren't in love with him it's better to end it sooner than later.|`|AFGxrXSyaa	defiantly go to marriage counselling. it will be worth while especially since you have a child to raise.|`|svdZrJfbaa	maybe you should go to some kind of marriage counselings<br>  not as a bad thing but maybe it will help you find your love for him again|`|8udo6hImaa	i am going throught the exact thing as you, you should email me we could definitely have some things to talk about.. <br>  <br>  maybe you have fallen out of love and just used to him being there thats what im in right now.. we have a baby and been together 3.5 years and its just too much now we dont have sex, dont talk, dont spend time together, its like all he does is ignore me and all i do is complain.. if your going through the same thing maybe its just that there is nothing left in the relationship and all you have in common now is a baby.. <br>  good luck<br>  shiekybabee03@yahoo.com|`|CWiQE0rvaa	Reason with him..... he must be very resposible for your good future and go for water sex and loving you will get new charm in it..!
IwDtJFy0aa	No you have every right to be mad.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	So you're upset because he made you swallow it......oh.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	NO, gobble away!YOU  got yourself in the situation and you deserve exactly what you got.|`|OHfZFR31aa	I don't understand why you are mad. You are the one who agreed to blow  his friend unless you were restrained and forced against your will. In that case, your husband and his friend can be arrested for sexual assault<br>  <br>  A guy can't make you swallow - you can just spit it out|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Wow hmmmm....so what you're saying is your husband "made" you go down on his friend, so he and his friend raped you, and you're upset only at the fact that he laughed when you gagged from the bad taste of some other dudes spunk?<br>  <br>  You're messed up.|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	Yes, I am sure.............(sigh).|`|4IekQKFAaa	both u n ur hubby r sickkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk...

Well he can't sue you for anything because you are primarily inside your house. If you think that you are ready to talk to him, then tell him how embarrassed you are to have been caught with that situation (besides, he did not yell right?) make a request that you would not want this your situation to be told to your neighborhood. But trust me, start looking for a new place.... because until your 67 year old neighbor is living, he will have a slip of the tongue regarding your story.|`|K2h6M1xqaa	You're human.  Humans masturbate.  Everybody on your street has touched their own thing, so nobody in their right mind has any business making you feel bad.<br>  <br>  And your neighbor is nearly 70 years old, so he's been through his own share of embarrassing stuff.  If he can't cut you some slack, then he's the one with problems.<br>  <br>  Don't sweat it.  Give it a week or two and you'll have it all put behind you.<br>  <br>  Cheers!<br>  <br>  EDIT **************<br>  <br>  Dude.  I just had a look at your previous questions.  You've been obsessing over this for three weeks now.  Give it a rest.  Life moves on.  Are you just looking for attention?|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	He cant have you arrested seeing you were in your own house, I bet you'll learn not to leave notes on the door and the door unlocked wont you?|`|1QiPrFyfaa	don't be silly he is 67 how many times do you think he has wanked and *** over himself ??!!!!<br>  how can you get done for it in your own house? it's your body you can do as you please|`|412167FVaa	You were inside your own home, take it easy and relax|`|isOU71uIaa	well, i dont think your neighbour will be that mean and tell everyone and no, he cant call the cops because you were in the comfort of your own home. It is embarrassing but you just need to forget about it, because it wasnt your fault he walked in on you and saw it. Though next time i recommend you do it in your bedroom with your door locked, just in case|`|d3s5oB63aa	Everyone masturbates. Everyone in touch with themselves anyway. Don't worry about it. I'd feel really embarassed but I wouldn't think my neighbour would go around telling people about it. I don't think they'd feel comfortable talking about it.|`|znvx2NMQaa	yeah i heard about it just before he said there was this tool sitting on  his couch jerking his 3" stick <br>  <br>  sorry dud i didnt realise he was talking about u.
vW7yI3Jnaa	you have only been together for 4 years? thats not long at all, spice up your sex life. I mean swinging is not even a last resort there are tons of things you guys can do to better your sex life for goodness sake. If you both want to fine, but no guarentee any of you will be together after that because you will most likely find someone you are more attracted to because they are better at sex than your wife is and visa versa. So i dont think that you should do it but hey its up to you.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	I would not recommend this idea.  So you have only been with each other.  I am married almost 22 years and have only been with my husband.  He has had a few other partners, and says meaningless sex is just that - meaningless and empty.  The sex between people who love each other and are committed is by far he best.  Experiment with each other within your marriage.|`|FXZLNc1aaa	I wouldnt recommend it. Think for a moment: would you have a problem with someone else bangin your wife? you might as well get a divorce if you're going to do that. i cant figure out for the life of me, why people claim this can "help" a relationship? Seeing/knowing your wife or hubby is having sex with someone else, isn't a turn on for me, and yes, it is "cheating" even if you both know. It's creepy.<br>  <br>  Plus, you can catch diseases that your spouse may not have, but the person9s) you've swung with might have the HIV....or something else. Not cool.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Heh...so when suddenly being comitted isn't convenient for you, you both decide it's time to consentually cheat on eachother?  Guess what.  Through good and bad times my friend, so tough it out.  Don't swing, you're both going to end up fighting in the end and it will all blow up in your faces.<br>  <br>  Try watching some of the reality tv shows on swingers relationship first, not just write ups on the internet.  That will show you what really happens.  How someone is left in a car outside a swingers party crying while their partner is having sex with everyone possible.  It's the worst thing you could ever do to your marriage.
pVnUhYLQaa	I would progress to the head. Talk, make out, feel up, finger; the head should progress naturally. <br>  Some girls will go right for the head, but not all are that forward.

You have to move on and forgive them becasue by holding a grudge with them you are stressed and causing yourself additional pain. Look at it this way, what if you were responsible for doing something to someone else's family member, what if you had no control over. I'm sure you would feel just as guilty as your neighbors. I think you should write a letter to them outlining exactly what you feel, get it all down on paper, allow yourself permission to say what you feel, then burn it.

Let them know that you just need time and you appreciate them making an effort and that you'll speak to them when you're ready. <br>  <br>  It takes a lot of effort to force yourself to be friendly - effort you should probably spend with your dad.

Like one is an idiot teenager and I have to protect her more then the 30 yr.old.

afcLu9YMaa	Looking at it generally and not working it out, I would say that you wouldn't get the Tax credits as these are normally paid to top up wages earned when you have children, the rest of it seems right.<br>  <br>  Maybe you have not claimed what you were entitled to when your husband was working, ie those tax credits.<br>  <br>  Rent and CT is normally paid, you would still get child benefit working or not and married couples JSA, maybe this is why it is so difficult for people to find another job after living on benefits, the trouble is that being out of work affects peoples confidence and self esteem and that is so important for a long term, happy, healthy life.

If you are dating someone, be honest, clearly tell him your in a relationship, so you don't lead him on. If you are single, and want to give this guy a chance, then tell him.

(I know, I was and am very young. but everything is going great.)|`|QGuxbItCaa	At 16 you have plenty of time for that. concentrate on your education and the boys/kissing/etc.  can come later.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	all i can say is, be yourself and don't do or pretend something you're not. have fun at the party.|`|UmYCDNBaaa	Guys will go for you, trust me|`|9wcHAcGCaa	a general rule is if a guy talks to you (not in bad way i.e f*ck off) he would be willing to sleep with you<br>  so basically if anyone talks to you you're in|`|DcYD9vWRaa	Its fine, you'll experience all this in your life, your only 16|`|6c8cUj3Aaa	Just be you.  with the teen age peer pressure your friends put on you stray away from that.  if you are looking for a relationship, do stress one will come when you are not looking.  <br>  <br>  also guys can pick up on the "I am putting myself out there" vibe and that's what some guys shy away from.  others are attracted to it.<br>  <br>  over all at the party you are going to, just be yourself and you will fine you will get a much better response!|`|QifRHwuiaa	so im 16 and never been kissed or never had a bf never had a close guy friend actually. just enjoy it. i actually liek it . this way i dont feel tied down to someone and i can just have fun flirting with random hot guys :)<br>  dw some guys (most) that i kno anyway are very immature and are just not worth it . even if they are drop dead gorgeous . still  you wouldnt want to be in a relationship that isnt going to go anywhere cause the guy is so immature. most guys our age just want to have fun with girls(several ) at once so they dont take this stuff as seriously. i think. well, i have a brother 2 yrs older and hes liek that. i gues si just use him as an example lol|`|TyQsGapmaa	Wear sexy outfit and put out to several guys at once.

mvrygTYTaa	As a girl, I'll say that you shouldn't worry about this at all. If in the future your wife would like them shaved then you should discuss this with her once you feel comfortable, but really it doesn't make a difference to most women that I know. Enjoy your wedding and your wedding night, and good luck on your marriage. Go into it with confidence. Remember she picked you despite flaws that she is already aware of. Pubic hair won't revolt her. I promise.|`|WWNWtzvDaa	how many wedding nights are you planning on ?? ...|`|QfTEYT3zaa	If you're getting married tomorrow this should be the least of your worries!

They are natural, your be fine. Once the night gets started that will be the last of your worries ;)<br>  Congrats and i hope it goes well|`|hHndD5SEaa	god you really dont have much to worry about if  this is the extent of it!!!!

Probably your wife may not be bothered at all.|`|5EFJlIJSaa	no.|`|w17inGeWaa	lol don't go round saying your FIRST wedding night, hide this from the little lady it looks like your expecting another wife, which would actually be pretty cool having two wives i might move to saudi arabia.
fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	if your boyfriend gave a s*** he wouldnt tell his best friend in the first place, he would want to keep what you two have special not going around boasting about it. I dont think your boyfriend is a BAD person, i just think hes immature and needs to learn to stop bragging about sex to his boys. And about his lying, he's probably just embarassed and doesnt want to lose you... or the sexual favours.|`|sTqfKpbraa	he is just a bit immature<br>  just ignore this if it does not bother much and evrything will be fine|`|kWaAlV32aa	This guy is soooo immature. (like most).|`|cabfd44f77bc4fb19e6d9f0aa7aedf7daa	wow long lol<br>  well its not right what you bf is doing about lying,secondly he probably shouldn't have said anything or you to have allowed him b/c guys can get cocky on these things(no pun intended) or find the sotry interesting and start blabbing off. if he wanted to just show off and tell people what he did then he did rightwrong) by saying it aloud.<br>  <br>  you broke up with himm>? seems like the right thing to have done since you can't trust him about this little thing.,but hes not the only one to blame since you gave him permission, he abused that permission and blabbed. soo idk what else could happen<br>  <br>  not good for two face b/c problems can occur even more|`|tC6bKxRAaa	I'm sure everyone is taking this way to far with there answers to your question. Guys are simple if you told your boyfriend he could tell Patrick I'm pretty sure he only told Patrick. If anything I don't think your boyfriend is lying to you, Patrick spilled the beans and prob brought it up to a whole crowd of there friends when they were all hanging out. If you Don't trust your boyfriend then it will probably never work out. Stop being so hard on him. If anything you should be worrying about how immature he is.|`|49NQJg2Baa	It sounds like he always wanted to break up with you and found the perfect.Patrick shouldnt be scared of him coz your boyfriend lied and said that Patrick told your secret to your WORST enemy. and plus Patrick has every right to tell you coz your his BEST FRIEND and you have every right to know.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I can't believe I read all that....whew..<br>  <br>  Take some responsibility here. YOU are the one to blame for all of this - not your bf and not Patrick.  YOU. Only you. YOU were the one that did the sexual act. YOU are the one that claims to know how boys are. YOU are the one who said it was ok to tell Patrick. YOU are the one that trusted Patrick, bestfriends and all.  <br>  <br>  YOU are the one that believes that you boyfriend just "slipped" with this major classified super secret in front of everyone, but YOU blame Patrick.  YOU say that Patrick is afraid of your bf and will do whatever he wants.  YOU are the one believing this crap.  YOU are the one playing games.  YOU are the one that wanted the entire school to know what you did with your bf and now YOU are trying to control his friendship with someone that didn't do anything.  <br>  <br>  YOU are delusional if you think that this wouldn't happen.

a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	its not the problems, or the lack of money its betrayal. when u get betrayed u just don't feel the same anymore about that person. shattered ego=divorce.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Divorce used to be socially unacceptable.  Many people stayed in unhappy marriages just to avoid the shame associated with divorce.  <br>  <br>  Also, life expectancy has skyrocketed.  It's been said that "till death do us part" was a much shorter commitment when women died in childbirth and men went off to war.  <br>  <br>  I don't believe marriage is doomed but not all marriages work.  People can change a lot over ten, twenty, even forty years.  Being able to make a marriage work at all the different stages of life is difficult.  And when times get tough, both spouses must be willing to work together.  Many times one spouse is less willing.|`|wzqahEqiaa	I think people today can get divorced to easy. If someone is being abused they should get divorced. Many people are selfish, base everything on emotions, and don't take commitment seriously.<br>  <br>  The "getting whatever I want" and "window shopping" attitudes need to end. I'm tired of society treating relationships and people like everything is disposable. I take promises seriously and I have every intention of keeping my commitments until death.<br>  <br>  My parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.

In the cases of infidelity or abuse it's perfectly fine to divorce, but I don't think people try to work things out, they just file for divorce at the drop of a hat.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Infidelity.  Trust being abused and broken.|`|djUMvICoaa	Things change and people change.  People also feel they have more choices today, especially women, they no longer have to stay in a bad marriage.  Others get married too young, not really knowing what they want, but it feels so good, ya know.  Is it good or bad?  It can be both.  Good to be able to find a partner that completes you, bad because it can be so devastating to others.|`|FnGebaOLaa	now that it is not taboo it is not such a big deal...<br>  when my mother was a kid (45 years ago) she had ONE friend whoe's parents were divorced. <br>  when I was a kid almost ALL of my friends parents were divorced!
YjUztskvaa	getting in a relationship is a risk. you wouldn't know the outcome until you try it.|`|2KJvaWDYaa	its great that ur both friends, that the best relationship to start from. at the same time u both have feelings for one another so by not dating ur just denying what is already there, not getting rid of it. if u were just to remain friends then there would always be this big elephant in the room, u know?<br>  i think u should date. this scott guy sounds like a bit of a prick. he shouldnt stop u from happiness.<br>  good luck!|`|CFFxtileaa	Tell him exactly how you feel!<br>  Tell him how much he means to you, and that you don't want to risk losing him because he means so much to you and you love him so much! He will be flattered by this and I'm sure you can work something out, <br>  <br>  This other guy, Scott, doesn't sound like boyfriend material, I think you should just say to him that you either want to be his girlfriend, or not. He can't have whatever he wants and he can't just use you like that.<br>  <br>  Just talk to Carl and tell him how you feel, he will probably say he feels the same way, having a relationship with a good friend is a big risk. Make sure, before you start the relationship, that both you and him agree to still act like best friends even while your in the relationship, you could say to him that you want to stay the way you are, but you want to do other stuff aswell (Kissing, sex etc.. Depending on your age). <br>  <br>  I'm sure he will understand and feel exactly the same way, and you can come to a decision and make an 'oath' to stay best friends forever,<br>  <br>  Good Luck and hope it turns out well<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx

iPiqfm85aa	I totally feel your pain. I'm a girl and am now 25, almost 26, and met my first boyfriend when i was 22. I had never been with anyone until then and it was quite hard at times, especially in high school, seeing all my girlfriends getting together with guys and I would be the only one always single... <br>  <br>  I think the way the media and society in general portrays young people adds a lot to us feeling paranoid about it. You're just turning 21 now and are still so, so young! You have all the time in the world to find the right person for you so that your experience will truly be special.<br>  <br>  I know it's easy to say, but as I wrote, I did not go with the crowd just so i could 'experience' what everyone else had for the sake of it because my own feelings were more important than the hype. And also, I hadn't met the right person and wouldn't just settle for anyone, no matter how lonely I felt at times (I know it can make you feel very sad and it can even make you question if there's something wrong with you-- but there isn't!!)<br>  <br>  From what you wrote about yourself you sound perfectly loveable, it is only a matter of finding the right girl, I think. Sometimes people come into our lives when we least expect it, and you never know when it will happen. Just try and enjoy the company of your friends, maybe increase chances of meeting more girls by going out more without dwelling on the fact that you're 'already' almost 21!<br>  <br>  I think one of the keys to meeting people and forming deeper relationships is to be yourself -- I don't think what you wear should matter much unless it is very strange, but even then you should remain true to yourself, I suppose. If there is someone you like out there then maybe make a bit of effort to look your best around her, as anyone would to improve their chances in most things, I guess, but apart from that I think your friends are right that you should give it time. Just make sure you remain receptive and when you meet a girl you like try and let her know and see what happens :)|`|YW2y5WoOaa	Dude, quit acting like a wussy.  Be glad you don't have a girlfriend.

You are fine, just have fun. When the right girl comes around you'll be ready for her.|`|Lt8Fg5Ekaa	Exchange phone numbers with girls that you would like to meet.  This allows both of you to get to know each other before kissing (or any intimate action) is done.<br>  <br>  If you would like to kiss a girl who is a friend, and not a girlfriend, do so (I hope that the slap is not too hard).  After she slaps you, the two of you might decide to date.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about your age.  Worry about your shyness.  Remember, girls are far more shy than you are, and often would not think of asking you for a date.  You have to initiate the relationship.  Expect a tremendous amount of disappointment and expect a tiny amount of sheer joy (which makes it all worthwhile).|`|S5FZy9Ppaa	I never did either, I don't know what to tell you. guess i'll grow old and miserable by myself....|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	lol, dont meant to sound shallow, but start wearing jeans my man!

It just is not your time.  forget about it and move on that is when you will find yourself in a relationship.<br>  <br>  <br>  good luck hope I helped some.|`|0IhCFeXLaa	its ok =]<br>  but you should find a girl you like and make a first move?<br>  <br>  and have confidence|`|836vtf9Saa	you don/'t like movies? not good for dates<br>  no jeans? not good for dates either<br>  get advice from your friends|`|QGuxbItCaa	I didn't read all of your question, but don't sweat not having a girlfriend. Mostly they are fake, and then you marry one, and your live will go downhill. You will never be as happy as you are currently. Better to invest your time in a good dog, and go get the milk for free. Don't buy the cow.
1nN3v4foaa	If in doubt, test him, don't give him any money and see how he reacts to this news.  Do I think he is using you?  Yes, I do.  For you to even ask this question, it has crossed your mind too.  You deserve better than someone who doesn't even apologize after a fight.  Also, next time you have a fight and he wants sex, say no and see his reaction.  No matter what, don't give him any money and see.  I understand you doubt mind giving it to him, but he shouldn't even be asking you for it.  If your supporting him now, it will only get worse and you're teaching him that he doesn't have to say sorry in order to get what he wants.<br>  <br>  Good luck at any rate!!

b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	I waited to date till I found the guy that I could see myself marrying.  Part of that decision was religious, part of it was a personal choice.  I didn't want to waste my time and emotions on guys that I would never spend my life with.  And it made it so much easier to focus on school and getting good grades.<br>  We have been together for a little over two years and have been married for eight months now and we're still as in love as we ever were.  In fact, I love him more everyday!|`|88234fa7f47e6fd5bb301672de45093eaa	Nope.  I was with my first love for 15 years, and thank heaven, we didn't marry.  I found the right person much later.

We know that we're soul mates and are so blessed to have each other.  He gets more romantic as time passes.  For Valentine's Day, he recorded a CD for me telling me how much I mean to him-he also did the background music and label.  We sure don't have much, we're just hard working people barely getting by, but we have everything we need in life, our eternal love for one another.|`|3BB8Gn0taa	I did marry my first love.

Best 6 years of my life.|`|5545d2a19349ba1665bcc132f6adae6faa	No.  I think it is great for those people who are able to marry their first love.

We were married for 5 years. And had a son, now we are separated and get along so good, and love each other as friends.<br>  <br>  Now i am with a person i love so so much, but is so ignorant to me, why do we fall for them. I dont know, but just take your time, so times you will fell like you need to get married because your getting old but my friend told me that she went to her 10 high school reunion and every single one of her friends were married and not her, and everyone was like awww poor Heather, then 10 years later more at her 20 year reunion they were like your so lucky, you can do whatever you want lol.|`|385209cc24ba0ae29cd92433cff579feaa	Yes I did.

But it certainly sounds like it!<br>  yeaa|`|hHIFCgbTaa	If you have to ask then chances are you're not.<br>  Plus your so young, don't rush things, you have so much time.<br>  Just remember the consequences of a sexual relationship at your age.<br>  But it sounds like you have a pretty good thing going. :]|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	yes, you are in love. congrats.|`|eS63CfSLaa	Hi Mrs Cull,<br>  <br>  Is it really love? This is a question that nobody can answer for you. Have you tried speaking to your parents about this? What does your mother or elder sister/s (if you have any) have to say about your relationship? It might be embarrassing to talk to your parents about boys, love & sex- but they are the best people to go to when you feel you need to talk. Maybe there are other members of your family, you feel close to. Try talking to them.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that you are both still very young, although you two might not think so. This doesn't mean that you don't love each other, it is great that you enjoy each other's company. All I can say is that if you are not paying the mobile phone bills- is it fair to expect someone else to foot the bill? 7 hours, come on now!<br>  <br>  It is a very good thing that your boyfriend is not pressuring you to have sex- I guess this is what you are talking about when you mention still being virgins. Unless you are in Canada, where the age of consent is 14 (the age you are legally allowed to have sex, even if you are the same age), if you and your boyfriend have sex now you will be breaking the law. In addition, at 15 do you really want to worry about falling pregnant? This can happen even if you use protection.<br>  <br>  At 15, the rest of your lives- is a long, long, long time. You are both still so young, who knows what you might be doing 5 months from now. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps. All the best.<br>  <br>  Love & Blessings<br>  <br>  x|`|49NQJg2Baa	that is called TRUE LOVE. CONGRATULATIONSSSSS<br>  take it slow, coz it looks lik your moving on too fast, by the way(pleeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaaazzzzzzzzz listen to me)DO NOT HAVE SEX UNTIL YOUR MARRIED, THE RISKS ARE HIGH.|`|u3Fnrvk3aa	Well just go with it and see what happens, he sounds really nice unlike all the other lads at that age haha :)<br>  Happy for you both!<br>  Good luck!!|`|19TSkwaKaa	So you're asking if you think its okay to have sex with him really arnt you.<br>  If you're both ready, why not?<br>  <br>  Maybe wait untill you're both 16 if you can though...But it's your choice. if you feel ready go for it :)<br>  You probably do love him. But dont forget that your heart easily breaks. And at 16...This relationship has a strong possibilty of not lasting, only a small percentage of teenage relationships last forever.|`|hHndD5SEaa	ah thats so cute - although I wouldnt like to see yer phone bills!!!! It defo does sound like you two could be in love!! bless!<br>  xx
AA10065812	*** Possibly, and as for him not wanting to see her for 15 years, I tend to take such claims with a pound of salt.  Do you fear her learning that he actually tried seeing her and finally gave up after several court hearings?  That happens in over 60% of the cases.|`|c4d179c54efba1c73a993ab6f248346aaa	tell them you want a new mediator.. your 15 should have a say in if she wants to see him or not..|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Mediator doesn't have the say. If your daughter refuses to go. Request a custody hearing by a Judge. The judge will flat out ask your daughter, and then make a judgement.
dsoqVFagaa	seems you don't really love her, if you do, you wouldn't wonder if you should break up with her that easily. Going for 3 months is not too much at all, put yourself in her place, if you got an intership, do you want her to break up with you ?|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	if there is no trust in a relationship, then there is no use to be in it.|`|ufj1ukCOaa	it takes years 2 build trust but seconds to break it:) but it sounds like u don't trust her in t eh first place so theres no going wrong is theree^o)?|`|TyQsGapmaa	Keep her but get another girl on the side in case she cheats.|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Cheat! If she haven't said she wants to break up with you... I don't see why you should. Just date other chicks while she's absent! ;)|`|OFuwKTWUaa	Has she eva dun anythin to lose ur trust, if so mayb u shud end it but if she has always bin faithful to u y wud she break ur trust now, stay wiv her n thn c wht happens, u mite dump her n thn u will neva no if she wud hav bin faithful. If she truly loves u she wont "meet" sum1, if she does thn u will no she wasn't 4 u x

OFuwKTWUaa	the thing wiv the girl was prob jst a rebound, i think u shud stay wiv him, he's a guy n he prob didnt think it thru wen he hid it frm u, giv him 1 last chance. x|`|UFDxV7rpaa	leave him<br>  <br>  if he didnt want to hurt you or lose you he shouldnt of done it in the first place|`|TyQsGapmaa	Did they do anal? If they did then break up cause thats just gross and the poop smell won't come off his penis.|`|9wcHAcGCaa	i read whole thing<br>  10 pts!!!!!!!<br>  i dont know btw|`|2UtprDToaa	he seems like my boyfriend we havent been together very long but i would say you have tried alot and nothing seems to change he seems like he is only trying to fit in with friends but if he wants to do that let him go talk to him ask him why if he says i dont know or i just dont wanna lose you he is lying.|`|kWaAlV32aa	Gosh that's a long story! I think if he really cared for you he would tell you the truth. It's no good hiding secrets in a relationship, even though they say they don't want to hurt you. If you can't trust him 100%, you shouldn't stay with him, otherwise you'll just be worrying all the time. (This is obvious by the way you look at his phone all the time. I never look at my husband's phone.)<br>  Also sounds like he's not committed to you. How can you be sick of having sex with your so called partner? What's he going to think 10 years down the line?<br>  By the way, I personally don't think there`s anything wrong with having sex with someone a week after breaking up with your girlfriend. I bet most guys do that.<br>  This guy is definitely NOT for you.|`|a0ae5c48e87004927c37e9e1e8df4f68aa	The person u love is not loyal to you... If he truly loves you , he will not think of other girls to have sex with them .. <br>  So its time for you to take a right step to dump him...|`|oQEqF4alaa	Well your relationship is kinda almost likes mines but yeah. Well i know it is wrong to cheat on the one you love but sometimes people do crazy things. So if you really love this guy and wants to be with him and he wants to be with you, you should talk to him about it and maybe change how you guys have sex a little like if its this boring just intercourse and moaning then change it. You guys should talk about it like if he evens tries to do it again then make a punishment, like how my boyfriend makes a punishment for me if i did tried to cheat on him he would end the relationship which im trying my hardest not to cheat on him.|`|tUIEWhsUaa	Okay, I went through a situation similar to that one. But to be truthful to you I am going to tell you something, Once guys lie, they will always. And the part that hurts more is when you actually know they are lying and they still do it. once you forgive them, they will know that next time they lie you will forgive them again. But girl, the question here is IS ALL THIS MAKING YOU HAPPY?? If your answer is no, then you know what to do. Specially when a guy expresses he is tired of having s*x with you, you already know what he is going to do. I mean even if he still with you is because YOU ARE THE ONLY ONE THAT IS WILLING TO PUT UP WITH IT. Open your eyes, and have dignity. Good luck sweetie.
oPY3I1hOaa	it doesnt matter if this girl has braces.<br>  i used to have braces before and when i kissed a boy and it was just fine.<br>  you wont even notice if your kissing her.|`|l7fyLFFtaa	As long as you don't have braces too. You don't want to have to call the fire department to get you two unlocked from each other.|`|keMuGqLFaa	No it does not matter|`|Zxx7rOGPaa	thats alright...<br>  as long as she doesnt have bad breath! lol|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	you'll be running your tounge over some metal. do you mind?|`|AA10857451	It doesn't matter a bit.
b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	References, references, references!  That is the most important thing.  Ask the references how they are with communication, stress, dealing with changing situations, and obviously how the food was!|`|s9aTmNHQaa	references, and make sure you ring them!
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	she is his wife and she is still with him. your a threat to his whole world. u have to stop seeing her or he will eventually be pushed into coming after u.|`|qfVE2KFtaa	This a trick question right?|`|OHfZFR31aa	What do you expect him to do? It's his wife. I'd threaten any woman who went after my man.<br>  <br>   Stop seeing a married woman. If she really liked you and wasn't just using you for sex, she would have left her husband and filed for divorce. The fact that she is still with him shows how little she actually cares about you|`|wzqahEqiaa	It isn't wrong for someone to defend their marriage and spouse.  Don't have an affair and save yourself the problems.  There are many great single people in the world.  Have self respect, respect boundaries, and respect commitment.|`|pOCabUMvaa	Run, run, as fast as you can!!!!|`|IKXZZDH9aa	Let him catch you alone in a dark alley...that'll fix all your problems.|`|CyDVisE7aa	I cant stress how bad it is for you to be sleeping with another mans wife you just dont do that but I am not judging you cause we are only human although I am not condoning it the best thing to do is to report it to local law enforcement and get a restraining order.<br>  <br>  And stop sleeping with peoples wives|`|TUNvbXbgaa	Stop having sex with his wife.  find someone who is not married. how would you feel if your wife was sleeping with someone else.|`|YiDVUCdwaa	End the relationship and never see her again. Marriage is more than a fluffy ring exchange between two people.|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	I would help the husband :P|`|Jet2E58aaa	Look for someone who is single and free. Continue to see this woman at your own risk!|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	of course the husband will do that. duh... you're dating his wife.|`|VXiMtwIsaa	uh...stop messing w/ his wife-der!<br>  ppl like you...|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Uhh,.. stop sleeping with his wife?

AA11136246	I understand how you feel cause i have been to that emotions before...i can only tell you one thing, learn to love yourself among others and nothing could go wrong.  Life is not easy but if you love yourself so much you will try to go on and fight the obstacles around.  You are not the only one "alone" in this world.|`|Pp4F6D5Waa	Start to love yourself and enjoy things for you, put yourself first.

5V5L9DoBaa	i've never personally been in that situation so i dont know<br>  <br>  maybe he's gay, admitted to doing the crime so he could go and "drop the soap" in the men's showers in jail|`|HPqCRBq8aa	He cares for you a lot, to not be so selfish. He doesn't want you wait on him and miss your life. Plus he doesn't want the burden of thinking of you. Its better to face it alone. Same thing like war. You don't want to make to many friends, because it will hurt more when or if they are killed. Same thing with you. He doesn't want to love or care for you, then lose you to someone else because he's in jail. It will hurt more that way. I hope this helps you understand, because he sounds like a great guy. Some guys even go as far as tell their woman its okay, go have sex to satisfy your needs, but don't give anyone your heart.|`|37ana68Haa	that way you dont have to deal with the waiting and hes doing it cause he does care so yeah just stick with it and show him that you care dont leave him now its crucial that you dont cause if you do he will think he is worthless and maybe become depressed but if he has you hell say hey at least i have something to look forward to everyday|`|9wcHAcGCaa	so he doesnt **** up your brain

Just ask him and tell him you don't want it to be a problem.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well it shouldn't. If he is aware that you are currently unemployed, he should be prepared to pick up the tab on the date. However, if you feel this way, maybe you should invite him over for dinner next time? Tell him you appreciate him taking you out to dinner so often. However, I doubt he is really hesitating if he takes you out often. I am sure he has come to expect this. The best way to know is to ask him though. I am sure you guys are close enough for you to talk to him about it.

Imagina que est√°s casi reci√©n casada (5 a?os), 2 hijos peque?os y que por una persona en estado de ebriedad pierdas a tu pareja? Cre√≠a y quer√≠a morirme,  a pesar del amor por mis hijos no me pod√≠a sobreponer a mi dolor. Mi madre (q.e.p.d. falleci√≥ tambi√©n hace 1 a?o) me dijo unas palabras que nunca olvidar√©  "?T√∫ crees que Dios con el inmenso amor que nos tiene,   nos dar√≠a una cruz m√°s grande y pesada  de la que pudi√©ramos cargar?, no hija,  si Dios supiera que no podr√°s con el paquete no te hubiera dejado sola ".  No te dir√© que ha sido f√°cil,  pero ahora al ver a mis hijos convertidos en personas de bien, responsables, cari?osos y trabajadores  me siento muy orgullosa de lo que logr√©. (Modestia aparte) Yo s√© que mi esposo desde el cielo tambi√©n lo estar√° de m√≠ al ver que supe salir adelante yo sola. Te sugiero que llores todo lo que tengas que llorar,  pero que tambi√©n te busques una ocupaci√≥n.  Como te imaginar√°s, en mi caso, mis hijos, el trabajo y la casa eran mis "fugas" y cuando me d√≠ cuenta ya hab√≠a pasado 1, 5, 10 a?os y 20 a?os y ?sabes qu√©? sigo aqu√≠, rog√°ndole a Dios que todav√≠a me deje algunos a?os m√°s. Hace tambi√©n  muchos a?os que dej√© de reclamar y renegar a mi esposo, a Dios y a la vida  el haberme quedado sola. Ya dej√© descansar a mis muertos en paz.  Espero que mi experiencia te pueda ayudar en algo, saber que nuestra misi√≥n en esta vida todav√≠a no acaba y lo mejor que podemos hacer mientras estemos aqu√≠ es echarle ganas y entusiasmo a nuestra estancia  por esta tierra. ?

baf130a2a607da681a60051a131a8dfcaa	What's wrong with telling your best friend the truth. What's the meaning of best friends anyways? Can't shut your best friends off, you know. And best friends don't lie to each other. Shouldn't be any jealousy in between best friends. They're like brothers. I see my best friends like my own brothers, sometimes they're far more important than your own brother. Best friends know,especially,  how to treat each other right. And they totally trusted each other. So you can tell them how you feel, but sometimes there are things that are best not being said either. Good enough, yes?|`|kPca9BRwaa	suck it up and get over it life is too short to be worring about this stuff. either that stop hanging out with him you envy him that much and yes you are being a woose

mE48VMXiaa	Do you think he's got a substance abuse problem?  That would explain the lack of remorse, sudden change in behavior, and becoming withdrawn emotionally and physically.  <br>  <br>  If you think it's a possibility, check for any changes in his spending (of money and time), changes in the company he keeps... and other things that may be attributed to a substance abuse problem.<br>  <br>  If that's not the case, don't make excuses for him... get out before it gets worse because most likely, there WILL be a next time!|`|nBQeSu2faa	He should feel bad...as you already know , there is no excuse for this sort of behaviour, in fact it's quite shocking, he could have injured the baby. There could be something else going on in his life and he doesn't know how to handle it, so he lashed out at you. You MUST get to the bottom of this...don't  brush it under the carpet , just for peace. If you don't get this sort of thing sorted out..you can expect more of it. It's important you both learn to communicate, don't try to read what's going on in his mind..talk about everything ...that's what communicating is all about. Fighting is never the answer ..it solves nothing. I must tell you one more thing..if he ever attempts to do anything like that again ...you must leave, you have a responsibility to your children. If he continues to be upset and cry...you still need to deal with what happened..don't let the crying stop you from dealing with it.|`|TPN1yIj7aa	sweet heart, he is the one who did wrong. not you. to grab a woman by the throat whilst she is holding their 6 month old baby is out of order no matter what the provocation is. <br>  <br>  he may feel guilty, he may be blaming you. who knows, who cares. some of these answers here are right out of the dark ages where women were supposed to sit down shut up and get on with things. well times have changed. he's done this once, and it sounds as though you're blaming yourself. <br>  <br>  get a babysitter, talk to him about all the issues that led to this point. neither of you can bury your head in the sand about what led up to this. but there is one thing you MUST do. make it CLEAR as the nose on his face that if he ever does this again you wont be seen for dust. it isnt just you to think about, you have a child as well. do you realy want to be on  the receiving end of this again ? do you want your child to witness this again (or indeed be on the receiving end of it again) ? have the talk first but his behaviour is bad. A real man would have walked away gving you a few choice words. good luck.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	I think that he is shocked that he reacted this way and feels bad about himself. You said he asked for forgiveness. Did you give it? Have the two of you discussed this? <br>  You are going to have to be the leader for this one. Start a calm conversation with an apology for pushing him beyond his limits. Tell him that you forgive him but you want to make sure that both of you can work out a way to make sure it does not happen again. Give him a hug! Assure him of your love. Since this is an aberrant behavior for him, it is okay to work on it together. Now if it happens again, you will need to consider a separation and counseling.|`|FKzFx3mDaa	In my opinion, I think that he still loves you, but he is in just as much shock by his previous actions as you were. It is like you said, he had never been violent in the six years of your relationship, and he completly lost all self control. He is probably questioning his actions, as well as his character. He most likely keeps his distance, because he doesn't trust himself around you or your children. I doubt that he means to shun you, but he doesn't want to put you in that kind of danger again. If I had done what he did, I wouldn't worry if I loved the person I went off on, but if that person still loved me. He probably has doubts about your feelings because of what he did to you. What he did must have hit him hard. If I were you, I would sit down and talk about it. I know that it is difficult, but if you don't, than how will things change? You have to get both of your feelings out in the open and understand what caused this violent outburst. He doesn't sound like a naturally violent man, and your question states that you could see reason as to why he went off as he did. Figure out what went wrong, what you or he said and why he reacted in such a surprising way. I think that he feels dissapointed in himself, so cuddling and repetedly saying how much he loves you probably isn't that appealing to him. He loves you and doesn't want to hurt you. I am sorry that you have to experience this aspect of your marriage, but you have to think about it as a bump in the road that you have to get over and in the end will make you a stronger couple. I hope that this helps! Good Luck!|`|c6g92RRVaa	He probably does feel bad but like any man he isn't sure how to show it. Maybe YOU might feel the need to cuddle etc but men have a different way of dealing with their feelings. He probably feels so bad that he doesn't know what to say or do to make it up to you. Maybe what you said or did to provoke him was really hurtful!? He is probably confused but what you can say is "can I have a cuddle?" kiss and make up as long as he knows not to hurt you again.|`|uec7RIhbaa	i think he is feeling so disgusted with himself that he actualluy can't handle the idea that you CAN forgive him because he cannot forgive himself.  leave him with it for a while, he has to make his peace with what he did, he has to work through the guilt.  let him know if he wants to talk then you're there to do so and give him a few days grace period.  he's probably really struggling with the fact of what he did - sometimes it makes thikngs even worse when others are willing to overlook something you can't actually get past yourself.  he gets a few days but the moodiness will have to stop - if it doesn't you may have to get tough and let him know that you feel HE is now punishing YOU for forgiving him and being OK with it.  he needs to know that isn't ok and if he can't move past this then you may need to seek outside counselling or therapy.  good luck.|`|wWzaFy0uaa	Well, I'm not married myself, but I can at least give you what I think.. I think he needs some space and time to think..But if he starts practicing the same behavior everyday, let me know. my ym is michaela_angeli16...<br>  <br>  But don't feel bad...Maybe you need to bond more...<br>  <br>  I'm your 11 year old friend!!<br>  <br>  -michaela [[u can call me mik]]|`|qPA87l4eaa	He's shagging another woman|`|2YX18RE2aa	Men of decent character who are pushed to violent behavior are never happy with themselves after.<br>  <br>  You really should take a hard look at your behavior and determine what was said which pushed him over the edge.<br>  Men turn hurt into anger. Men also turn depression into anger.<br>  I'm not telling you that what he did was right but I'm sure that there was some significant hurt attached.<br>  <br>  I will also suggest with a new baby in the house that he is dealing with a level of stress he has not experienced before. You might also have adopted the "I'm a mommy now its all about me attitude". This all causes a breakdown in effective communication.<br>  <br>  There are a lot of reasons for his behavior and I can see where is came from.<br>  <br>  As for turning his back, he is not ready to be close again whether from hurt or shame. Give it some time .<br>  Determine what caused this outburst.<br>  <br>  No guy with normal good intent wants to think of himself as an abuser.|`|9Ni21lHpaa	You had a pretty shocking experience.So apparently you had an arguement (while you were holding ure baby in ure arms..honey next time u even argue with anybody put the baby down so she isnt in the way and wont get hurt!)<br>  Married couples do have emotional arguements at times,especially when they have had a new baby(job,baby,mortgage,relationship and current economic tensions are a lot of things that recently ppl have had to juggle alot.Being a chef is a stressful job)You agree that u might have pushed him too far.<br>   Honey,he did realise what he had just done,and was shocked over it,did cry and apologized for it.It upset him to the extent that he realised he couldnt go to work(he was angry first,shocked later he wasnt in a condition to go to work)from his behaviour i feel he is very ashamed of himself,his putting his head down and listening to whatever you said,and being moody and silent shows that he is ashamed,embarrased and shocked,otherwise he would have been talking to you,or arguing with you and not treating it as a big deal.<br>  I am VERY sure he loves you!!!But i think his reaction shows that he himself is shocked over the incident,and he doesnt know how to react or how to start things in way that they return to normal.He feels he shouldnt touch you or cuddle you because he is now worried about your reaction,he could be scared to touch you again for what you might say or do! (will you forgive him,will you allow him to be near you?will you think his reaction towards you is genuine?a lot of things might be going through his mind)He IS showing remorse....otherwise he'd just go back to acting normal,and he isnt it means that what has happened has affected him a great deal.Actions do speak louder than words...that is one shocked remorseful guy.<br>  He just doesnt know how to react,how to get things back on track.This once forgive him,kiss him before work,tell him you love him,and just ignore what happened.You both take a day off,go to the park or zoo with the kids or some other thing that u guys do together as a family.You have already warned him what you are going to do if he does it again.Thats more than enough,and sweetie,try not to push each others buttons to the extreme point.Take very good care of yourself and him.you will get through this and im very sure u are loved.|`|AA10687304	I think he is just shocked with himself--maybe worried that it will happen again.  He could even be concerned that your feelings have changed.  Maybe he is keeping quiet around the house until things blow over, not wanting to return to the original argument or to argue more.<br>  <br>  I dont think in this case that there is lack of remorse.  I believe his actions are showing remorse and sadness for what happened.  At least you got an apology and werent told that you deserved it.  Being told that you deserve it is a statement made by abusive men all the time.  If you ever hear "dumb bi*** derserved it" out of his mouth take your kid and RUN.  That statement is a lack of remorse and indicates that it will happen again and again.|`|JF0SIngqaa	He may be under pressure from some other source. Have you sat down and tried to discuss what is really going on with him. If he has never done anything like this before than he must be under a lot of strain from something.Maybe health, work etc. Can't hurt to give it a try.He is hurting too.|`|OzHEtokmaa	Hmmm, well I used to be a domestic violence officer and this looks somewhat familiar. He clearly has some issues (as stated already) and it doesnt look as though he can articulate them to you at the moment (new baby, problems at work, another woman - who knows), but that does not excuse violence. The reactions to violence from the offender often go in a cycle of violence, remorse, honeymoon period, tension and then it starts again. Factually if it has happened once it is more likely to happen again. It may be that his being cool with you has something to do with his own shame and disgust at what he did.<br>  <br>  Please take great care and never assume that this is an acceptable part of your relationship.<br>  Sarah

TtuSkz39aa	Hmmm it must be hard for you going to an all boys school to meet girls. I went to an all girls school and i found it hard to meet boys too. I understand where your coming from and i have a few tips:<br>  <br>  1. Get out there! Go to the movies or other popular places where the girls like to hang out. Just ask around casually like, 'hey, so wheres all the girls these days?' and you shuould get answers. Chances are your not the only one feeling like this in your group.<br>  <br>  2. If you see a girl you like dont be afraid to talk to her, be tactful but be yourself and ask for her number. You never know where it could lead to.<br>  <br>  3. Often a relationship comes out of the blue when your not looking for it at all. You just need to be patient and things will change and a girl will be right round the corner for you. <br>  <br>  4. Theres nothing wrong with your apperance from what you say and you definitly have a lot of skills and experience in several different subjects. I dont sdee any reason why girls shouldnt be attracted to your looks AND your talents. Don't fret about your height, it doesnt matter how tall you are as decent girl will look beyond that because its whats inside that counts.<br>    <br>  Good luck with it all! Hope you can find a great gal!|`|ZAvV3WfLaa	I'm a girl so i dont know whether i should answer this but i dont think your doing anything wrong. & height doesn't matter, I'm 17 & i'm only 5ft 3, i wouldn't worry about it, the right girl will come along eventually.<br>  BTW: i can play river flow in you on the piano, i love it :]|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|b5782d80f1764b33c9393adefb225fb0aa	There's nothing wrong with you. You just need to be outgoing. Introduce yourself to girls when you're at the mall. Just walk up to a girl and introduce yourself to her and just have a conversation. Maybe it would lead to things.|`|Jb2PZpMVaa	Hmm.. well to me i think that you should go out more(not in a harsh way) and start hanging around with more girls and be really nice to them.. then all you have to do is wait.. :)<br>  <br>  good luck ! <br>  <br>  hope this helps :) xx|`|Qv2bUOqaaa	Don't fret about it so much.. the fact that you're in an all boys private school makes it very hard to find a girl. For that reason, I wouldn't feel too bad about it if I were you because it's not your fault. If you're not awkward and you truly are nice and caring, then I'm sure you will find a girl. You can go anywhere to find one. Go to the mall, a restaurant, another public place such as the gym or the pool in the summer. All you have to do is go up and make casual conversation. It might be cute if you said "Hey, I noticed you from over there and thought you were very pretty, and I wanted to know your name :)" If she responds well, you can make small talk and eventually ask for her number if you're interested in talking to her again. Don't rush anything though, you don't want to make the girl uncomfortable. You have to wait to see if she shows signs of interest before you make a move. Which may be smiling, touching you, flirting, or a lot of eye contact. By the way, there are plenty of short girls out there! haha. I'm sure you'll be able to find one for you :) Best of luck!|`|YbGULYAwaa	You sound like a really nice guy!!! and I am sure there is nothing wrong with your height.<br>  <br>  Where do you like to go??? swimming at the beach or pool, to the gym??<br>  <br>  I dont think you should just go somewhere just to meet girls unless it something that you are interested in doing(except for the girls ha ha)<br>  <br>  I mean go somewhere that interests you. You never know.<br>  <br>  If you see a nice girl start with saying hi!!!|`|yBHDa58Laa	why dont you try meeting some girls in your local area on facebook/bebo.<br>  <br>  but dont me over the top and over talkative online cos they might think its a bit weird that you've added them and then keep talking to them lol :) when you add them just tell them your from the boys school and your havin trouble meetin girls at the moment or something like that x|`|xNJFKGkMaa	may be the problem is that u go to an all boys private schools.try for co-ed collage at least,may be u will get over it.|`|cCsKLZM6aa	Well it sounds like you are a very talented guy. 5ft 4 isn't that short really, girls are as short as 5ft at your age.<br>  You can meet girls in loads of places, any where public. Go out with your friends somewhere like swimming, ice skating, to the cinema, bowling.. and all you have to do is be yourself, look confident and just start a conversation like you would with anyone. Use the things around you to start conversation. Get your female friends to introduce you to some girls. When you see a girl you like don't worry about what you should say/do too much. just act natural! best of luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and just because your 17 and never had a girlfriend isn't a big deal, so don't listen if anyone says anything mean.

6DGLxJ1daa	It is not worth her time.  She'd be perfectly able to find someone more patient, with more money.  He is insecure and that is not worth her time or energy, that will just drain her more and more and she will just be unhappy and resentful.  And he will never be satisfied because he'll always want her to spend time with him that she doesn't even have.  She can't make the day have more hours, seriously, and if he's not getting enough time or attention from her, it's for a reason.  He is not going to change.  It's not worth her time.<br>  The relationship should end.
JhvqUvlsaa	In order to make friendships that wil last, you have to be a friend yourself. Be nice, polite, funny, and helpful (but not overly helpful at first cuz people can take advantage of that). Don't give out phone numbers or email right away, but be willing to sit with them at lunch and meet with them somewhere for a coke or something. <br>  <br>  Friendships are a two way street; if you are giving your all, and they are caring about you too, it will work. If it seems to be one sided, stay friendly with those people, but keep looking for people who will care about you for you; not what you are, but who you are.|`|MPOHHTtAaa	Get a job or join a club, volunteer!|`|wd0WYcHKaa	Ebay|`|1EB7fbxpaa	Maybe we should be friends.

None of them live within 700 miles from me and I'm not moving.<br>  <br>  Here's some "karma" for you:  I have been dating a man for almost 2 months--great guy and I've been happier than in my previous 42 years on the planet...  Just this week found out that for the past few weeks his psycho ex has been doing drive-bys of his home while he's out of town or here and he's been keeping it from me and also doing some things I consider ill advised in an effort to make it stop--he says (I think it just keeps it going and that men can be really naive about women).  I had to take myself out of this relationship with very good potential for my own self preservation and self respect.  Ask me what I think about exes who cannot move on or let their ex move on?  Not much.<br>  <br>  In my situation, they were broken up for 7 months and he dated other women before meeting me and making it "exclusive."  Only after I went to his house (one time for less than an hour in the middle of the day) did the drive-bys start occurring...|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Get on with your life.  They're your ex-girlfriends for a reason.  God clearly has a different path for you. If you dopn't quit obcessing over them you are going to miss your destiny.
fwappZXiaa	i've had the same exact problem; over-protective parents.<br>  it really sucks, i know exactly the way you feel.<br>  try to talk to them, if that didn't work then ask one of your friends' parents talk to them over the phone and  explain to them that it's not a big deal.  also tell your friend's parent to tell them that he/she will be staying with u (only for the first few times time u go out) , so ur parents would know that you're with an adult and taken care of.  Then believe me they would start to accept that u have grown up.<br>  <br>  Best of luck ! xxx|`|DJMPQlFDaa	What is your age. Your parents should allow you to at least go to church, the park (supervised if you are young) stay after school to hang out with your friends, take you to ymca with your friends, at least that is what my next door neighbor does for his 9 year old daughter.<br>  <br>  If you are older they can also let you get a job. If you live in a bad neighborhood I understand why they don't want you leaving out of the house until you are 16 or 17. But you are right they need to let you become an adult.|`|GegQJNzSaa	Maybe you should have your friends over alot. Let your parents get to know who you are hanging out with. There are alot of freaks out there and they want to keep you safe. Its a fact that you are not fully grown till you are in your 20's. So how can you be expected to make good decisions if your brain is still growing! I solved this problem with my kids by being the hang-out house The kids were always over. They still are! Their friends still come by to say hi and they are in their 20's now. I run into them on the street and they say Hi mom.I'm invited to weddings and baby showers. You can work with your parents,and be happy with the out come.|`|YbGULYAwaa	Have you listened to their reasons???|`|6lkNOFNlaa	Your parents are just worried about you and you will thank them for it when you are older, I'm sure.<br>  The world is a pretty dark place, take it from someone whose had experience. <br>  Talk to them and try to compromise. Tell them that you will take things slow and won't be out all the time and they'll soon get used to the idea.<br>  No parent wants to see their baby grow up.<br>  Just be reasonable and calm and I'm sure things will work out.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	How often do you actually sit down and talk to your parents?    Think about this.   You should sit them down and ask them this question.   Talk to them about everything that is happening in your life.   Let them know you are acting responsibly.   The more they know you and how you act, the more they will let you do.   Keep your relationship with your parents open and you will be rewarded.   Next year you will be 16.   That is usually the year that parents start to let their kids do more things.   But you can get a head start by talking to your parents openly now.   Good luck.

If he REALLY liked you, he would not have lied and he would do the responsible thing and back well off.<br>  <br>  I believe that love can strike early, but I also believe that any 18 year old willfully and knowingly chasing a 13 year old is very unlikely to have the 13 year old's best interests at heart.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, as it's obvious this guy means a lot to you, but I really do think you are better off without him.|`|5240e2886ce3131fd0d3f327ae7b2561aa	Wow.

I am not going to lecture you saying that you don't know what love is, because I believe you do.  <br>  I am just going to tell you that if you love him...you will leave him alone.<br>  If he loves you, he will wait til you're 18.<br>  <br>  I'm also sorry to say this, but the fact that you called his job and told them..proves that you are not mature enough for that kind of relationship.<br>  <br>  If you continue with this, you are either going to wind up pregnant or he's going to end up in jail.

x5445f2Eaa	The take home message from the movie "When Harry Met Sally" was that men and women can't be "just friends". I have no idea if this is true or not. What I do know is that it is very VERY common for friends to at some point think "Hey, so-and-so and I really get along well. I wonder if this could be more than friendship?"<br>  <br>  What you have to ask yourself is.... why are you "just friends" with this person? Put aside your feelings for a second and ask, would you and he work as a couple together? Can you communicate well with him? Do you feel happy when you are with him? Are you comfortable being with him in a variety of different situations (social, private, family, etc.)? Are you sexually attracted to him?<br>  <br>  The other half of the equation, is him. Does he have a significant other? Does he want a relationship? Do you get the feeling that he could have stronger-than-friend feelings for you? <br>  <br>  And of course, is it even possible for you two to become more than friends? Do you live nearby each other? Do you have enough free time for each other?Are you ready for a relationship?<br>  <br>  It is perfectly natural to feel attracted to your friends. Sometimes it works and can transition to something more. Often it can be very hard, especially if you have been just friends for a long time. If you want to pursue it, I would encourage you to have an honest talk with your friend. Don't play games with him- tell him how you feel and be honest about being worried about risking your friendship.|`|YGovMe9Qaa	don't know your age, but if the feelings are mutual it'll happen.|`|uWfOypP6aa	as common as this will sound....spk to him.....tell him how you feel....if he says just friends then you decide if he says he is interested thyen you bothdecide...2 minds are better than one?hehe|`|kljxM00laa	i don't know about your feel but i know that is your were close friend and always thinkng about him i guest do what you if you are in love or not and ask him first before you fall in love with him
8c643a48148981e73f897b3569fc6e5eaa	Break up with your boyfriend and immediately jump into a new thing with his friend. Isn't that what you want to do?|`|AA10740893	No no no no....the situation won't work out....<br>  Get out of the relationship with your current and take a break. You will need a clear head if you are going to go after his friend. Now remember friendship is valued more then relationships. Are you sure his friend is showing you interest?|`|0e5e4750228c5c14532dc3c039ea58fbaa	you fall for the one you share more moments with, its natural.<br>  spend more time with your boy friend.|`|33lXZKQ2aa	i am sorry to hear about you and your boyfriend...my boyfriend and i just split after two years and it is rough...however are you just seeing his friend as a way out of the situation with him? if so...i would let your boyfriend know you want to split before even thinking about going out with his friend because that will make him hurt even more...however, if you really think things with him wont last..and you think they would with his friend...you have to live your life..just don't hurt your boyfriend. you just have to follow your heart..it will tell you the right thing to do. i hope everything works out well for you.|`|AA11007767	I think you owe it to your bf to try and figure out what's happening between you. I think it would be a good idea if the two of you do not hang out with his friend right now. Not until you've resolved your own relationship.<br>  <br>  As you said, it is a rough patch. Are you willing to give up something you know for a fantasy? Do some journalling and soul searching and ask yourself what it is that appeals to you about your bf. Is he good to you? Can you talk with him about things easiliy? Do you do fun things together? Ask yourself what is important in a bf for you.<br>  <br>  If you think you want to break up with your bf, do that first. If then you want to approach his friend, that's not too cool either because it would probably be hurtful to your bf. But if you want to break up, be single and let your eye wander, go ahead.<br>  <br>  Talk things over with your bf, be straight with yourself and him.|`|Oum9nM2Zaa	this is really tricky. First decide if you want to be with your boyfriend anymore. If you're willing to lose him then break up.<br>  If you try anything with his friend you have to understand that there is a possibility that the friend will be loyal to your (ex)boyfriend and not date you even if he does have feelings for you... (the "bros before hoes" deal)  If you want to go after this guy then you have to be prepared to lose them both. <br>  <br>  With that said, If you really want this guy you would have to be willing to put in a lot of time. I'd break up with the boyfriend but it has to be as friendly of a break as possible so he has no reason to trash talk you to the friend. Then start hanging out with the friend. A relationship might blossom. But be prepared to lose them both. The friend might not be into you like that and he also might not want to hang out with you alone. Try to figure out if he's your friend or just your boyfriend's friend.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|c258d761f395f55b6050a574f729dcc9aa	if u think u are going thru a rough patch now, then what do u think would happen if you seduced your bf's friend. how could u even consider going after his friend??? i am not calling you a **** or anything, but u can't care for your bf that much if you could date his friend. he should leave you and never come back b/c you're not even worth it.|`|oreji9bwaa	Break up with your boyfriend and forget about his friend. Find some other men to sleep with.
K5STAI61aa	You'll just have to learn how to get over things.  We can't all have what we want, especially when we know it's not good for us.  Do you usually do things that aren't good for you?  Is this the only guy around???  Move on.|`|10bb153a928c9693ebec1b2660853526aa	Find someone else to obsess over.

Best way to get over someone is not to be around them. Try getting ot know other guys and go on some dates......realise you are much better off without this guy who you clearly know is a player.

First I <br>  want to say that all I can do is offer my opinion and I don't <br>  fully know what you are dealing with, but based off what I <br>  have learned life is short and you do not want to waste time<br>  on a person you know deep down inside is not right for you. <br>   I am not sayijng your  friend is  a bad person, I  am just <br>  saying based off my own experience with having feelings for<br>  previous men, if you don't follow your intuition you will end up<br>  making a bad decision and then regret it.  The first thing you should do if you have not already, make a pros and cons list<br>  about having any kind of relationship with this person.  You<br>  should examine if the conns outweigh the pros, or vice versa.<br>  The next thing you could do is examine why you have feelings for this person in the first place, what are your mootves, what <br>  are you looking for in this person. I noticed that you mentioned he is a playa and he is sometimes sweet; if he is<br>  someone not ready to commit and if he disrepects other women he will disrespect you, I don't care how cute or sometimes sweet he is. I have learned you have to look at a <br>  man's character and track record, you can not just go by how <br>  you feel because feelings change. Overall you should examine what you want for yourself and what you desire from <br>  a relationship with a man. I am married and prior to being marrid I met many guys who I thought were the ones, or I  crushed on; but after I started seeking what truly was right for me and stopped searching for the one, he came into my life<br>  and he is wonderful, not perfect, but he loves me. I don't think<br>  you are trying to find a husband or make this guy fall in love with you, I am just saying know your worth because the right kind of man will and he will treat you according to how much he views your  worth, but you must know it first; don't settle for less than what you are worth.

C4sPzxDmaa	Esta pregunta siempre desata el debate. Por un lado est√°n los defensores de la qu√≠mica instant√°nea, y por el otro, los que descalifican con √©nfasis la posibilidad de que un hombre y una mujer se enamoren con tan s√≥lo mirarse. Es probable que tanto unos como los otros tengan raz√≥n, pues existen casos que confirman la primer teor√≠a y otros que la refutan. Pero lo cierto es que quienes ponen todas sus expectativas en enamorarse en el primer contacto, generalmente llevan las de perder, pues ponen tantas expectativas en la primera cita que si no logran su objetivo se sienten irremediablemente frustrados. <br>  <br>  Los t√≠midos suelen alinearse entre los que apuestan a la qu√≠mica instant√°nea. Y es que les cuesta tanto tomar la iniciativa de invitar o aceptar la invitaci√≥n de alguien, que prefieren apostar todas sus fichas en una supercita que los conduzca directamente al amor y los saque del aprieto de tener que buscarlo.|`|2V2OKCC4aa	Si, a mi me ha pasado hace dos a?os vi un chavo guapisimo que va en mi escuela, me encantaba no dejaba de pensar en el no le hablaba ni nada pero hace una semana me decidi y me le declare y hace poco que somos novios y todavia sigo enamorada de el .|`|E6QUC1gRaa	NO, porque no|`|QZGZP2mMaa	Yo si creo en el amor a primera vista, pero no es tan com√∫n que suceda.No siempre se nos d√° la oportunidad de ser correspondida|`|T0Hoe5QTaa	hummm podr√≠a ser, no me pas√≥, pero nada es imposible!!!|`|lMpc2M8Zaa	llevo ya 11 anos de casada con el que me enamore a primera vista tu misma contesta te existe o no|`|rkeIgA6jaa	si claro!! me paso con mi ex la vi y fue... wow!! pero no todo lo aparenta ser genuino lo es, es decir vez un chavo y bom!! te late ca?on pero al final te das cuenta que en realidad es un ser hostil y prepotente, claro que hay sus esepciones como mi ex!! oh Dios mio que mujer!! tambien es bueno conoser a las personas despues del primer pesta?aso; no vaya ser la bestia en lugar de la bestia, y t tengas que conformar con ara?asos en vez de caricias y besos!!|`|skwvg0xRaa	no, creo que hay pocas personas que logran eso , yo creo en el amor que se cultiva, que se convierte de una amistad a algo m√°s con quien sabes que puedes convivir|`|rBKTF2ivaa	Eso creo puede pasar mas de solamente una vez en la vida.<br>  Lo interesante es que cuando no se puede parar de pensar en la persona significa que te vas a casar con ella.

a3654b92262a231e61e419f055d77497aa	Sounds like me. Well I can think of three ways. You can go up to him yourself and be like I want the honest answer, do you like me or not? Or you could get one of your friends to go up to him and ask him for you if you are shy. Then if those two dont seem too interesting you could write him a note and give it to him. You dont have to talk and its easy no pressure. So whatever you want. Hope this works.|`|n1HZvR2gaa	talk to him i feel the same way always lol.<br>  but try talking to him<br>  best of luck!!

rmQKOcp5aa	Well I think that you should confront her and tell her off what does it matter that she is pregnant its not like if you are gonna hit her, sometimes when u get pregnant you get really upset for everything its like a stage but this ***** has crossed the line, and u need to stand up for yourself if you don't she is gonna keep on doing it....Try and make you boyfriend to understand you too cause they intend to always take their sister's side even though they are soooo wrong!!

ba2b0c7b7d6c09abcf3a3d6bac39f5e5aa	Strangely enough, my ex-next door neighbour met a man online from US (I'm in Australia) about 4 years ago. He came over here, they dated, then married and now have two children. So against my doubts it did work. So give it a shot; if it works, it works, if not then you can still be friends. Nothing to worry about (but make sure you check his name in google first to make sure he isn't an axe murder ;) )|`|q1Ty3nk6aa	Yeah. He basically ditched me after the first date 'cause he felt the chemistry wasn't there.<br>  <br>  The reason for that is that I got so goddamn nervous and didn't want to make myself sound stupid, so I didn't talk much. I let him do almost all of the talking and having talked for months online and had really good conversations, it was a huge let-down.<br>  <br>  So long as you don't do the same as me, you should be fine.<br>  <br>  However, this guy I met was actually a friend of a friend, who I'd met once before rather than some stranger I'd never met.<br>  <br>  Be careful and good luck :]|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you cannot fall in love with someone you've never met.  you must be super lonely. find a real boyfriend. stop living in a dream world.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Just don't worry about it.   even if there was chemistry problem, so what?  you can get over it and look for another guy.   you are not couple yet , so there shouldn't be emotional problem.
qmcZPFiXaa	When you two aren't around alot of people, talk to him. Tell him (nicely!) you like him and all, but you need your space. You can tell him you have something to do at night. For instance, tell you have to do your homework.He's probably just trying to be nice and dosen't even realize he's bugging you. Give him a certain time when he can call and IM you. That way it won't seem like you're pushing him away.|`|m99D31vTaa	Uqhhh I hate that lol Im 14 & my boyfriends the same way . Im like "ohkay I know you like me & all but I dnt need to qive me all yur attention" Just tell him to relax a lil .|`|12xQlgr7aa	It may be awkward but talk to him about it. It'll hurt him, but at least it'll hurt less than breaking up would do. Tell him you need you're girl time or something. Good Luck :-)|`|AA11011446	Have a word with him before things get either worse or completely unbearable for you.  This would absolutely drive me insane (I'm 32) even at my age.  Be prepared for him not to take it well though, but you gotta be cruel to be kind.  Best of luck :-)|`|xz40cKnXaa	Tell him to back off and to relax a bit?|`|v398Qalyaa	he sounds very insecure, but you need to be honest with him and say it's too much, be kind with him, also say you need to do homework and going on MSN is meaning you are falling behind with it, if you aren't already, you soon will|`|YdbpwkFEaa	hi i was the same at that age just happy to have a girlfriend just ignore them and for lunch he will get bord soon, if hedoesn'tt email me and i will help you i am 15|`|RoTLnFGZaa	you need to tell him how you feel before yall have to break up|`|XCtjuhujaa	well bbe, 1stly he NEEDZ 2 know b4 u end it wid him.

If he still doesn't stop it then maybe you should start thinking of breaking up.|`|5EWoZsDIaa	Maybe you should encourage him to do things with his friends, or finding a hobbie, whatever he likes, like soccer, whatever. If he had other interests in life maybe he wouldnt be so clingy?.. If I were in your shoes I wouldnt ask him to back off, at least not at first- Id try to encourage him to do other things he might like as well, so you wont hurt his feelings, and maybe itll solve things?.|`|axokvVDsaa	just tell him to kind of not worry about you as much|`|cFktUueyaa	Dump him...are you his first girlfriend?|`|AA11706291	Just break up with him and tell him the reason why.|`|KuPjzXzYaa	tell him to take a chill pill, or do the thing that makes guys automatically step back- say: "i think i need some time alone, to sort things out in my head" puts dudes on the back burner.... my girlfriend told me that, then i calmed down and got the message
zmniQNRsaa	Nah, terms like "love", "hun" and interestingly "duck"  are used all the times by girls from where i come from, no one bats an eyelid, its just a friendly informal recognition. unless he is very homophobic i dont think it would bother him|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Hun is a barbarous and vicious person <br>  <br>  Attilla the Hun             Yes, I would mind<br>  <br>  <br>  Now if you said  "Hon"   short for honey  - that is different|`|TebPFTrJaa	I wouldn't be a fended if one of my friends called me thats, I would just take it as a kind gesture.|`|FOWQ8d0Qaa	umm..he probly thinks<br>  <br>  "omg omg omg i think she likes me :):):)"<br>  <br>  LOL, im not posivite tho :S|`|bbP9gBu8aa	Usually that is a good indication for a guy to know you like him more. However when I get called naturally by it by good close friends, I feel a stronger bond, so I take it as like a way to express a good time being together. Then on the other hand, it means to some guys that if he wants your attention in the middle of a conversation w/ other group of friends then he will be able to get your attention & acknowledge his problem. Therefore he would feel extra especial to be able to get you out of a pack friends w/ out waiting too long. Overall, it is a good bonding signal for more than a friend. CHEERS =)|`|dkzsbUy9aa	No, i wouldnt say its a bad thing to say, i would take that in a normal way. It could come across as flirting if you didnt know the girl but not with a friend<br>  <br>  I have friends who are girls and i call them lovely now and again<br>  Its nothing|`|dJUaACflaa	Here is what my first thought was - if you were a good friend of mine and you said that, it wouldn't phase me at all.<br>  However, if you said that and I had feelings for you - different story.<br>  <br>  Being called hun by a girl is not really a biggie these days unless you fancy them...
JPBh5WT3aa	You need to be brutally honest with your husband about this......tell him how terrible it makes you feel. It is his mother, and he needs to step up to the plate and tell his mother that this can't continue, that she is undermining you as a mother, and if she doesn't stop he will put a stop to it. He CAN do something about this, so what if she is rude to him and doesn't listen?? It is his job as your spouse to stand up for you. He needs to have real consequences for MIL if she refuses to listen......like eliminating her from his life until she does listen.    If he doesn't do this, you will forever be in a relationship dictated by this woman, and you will begin to resent your husband for allowing it to happen. It is his place to stand by your side and tell his mother to back off. Make him do it! Best of luck!|`|VMY7No0eaa	You can leave just about the time she is going to be there.  (make sure to lock the door)   or you can lock the door and leave the curtains open then start blasting the music and vaccume or do some other cleaning and just ignore the door.  Remember one day YOU will be a MIL... karma!  so be careful!|`|WSlxwSlFaa	go out more. like to the park. and when she comes even when your leaving tell her your leaving and you'll see her tmrw.|`|AA11496842	Refuse to answer the door and let her in.|`|AA11513482	Screen your calls and don't answer the door.|`|JV0i77uiaa	Oh boy, you have a toxic mother-in-law.  Tell you mother-in-law that you can take care of your own son.  Tell her that you would appreciate not to get involved with your son (in a nice way).  Since you already talked over to your husband, talk to him again.  Do you think there is a possibility that you can move away from her?  The other alternative is do not open the door or answer the phone.  Tell your husband the truth, he has to be stronger with her.|`|Vhfb7UACaa	Sounds like you need a restraining order.|`|e6f0256206b1ea8c927abbd5ed521df9aa	put your son in day care center for a while,once she stops start to look after your own son.but before that clear everything to your mom-in-law that you want to handle your son and want to become real mommy.|`|M52BJUrEaa	Sounds like you are going to have to be brutually honest with her...Ugh..That would irritate me and just have to let her have it!|`|N4oLz5vsaa	ignore phne calls and dnt let her in ur home|`|6sykknTJaa	well tell your husband to tell her to stop going to your house everyday....again|`|paerqxfMaa	You AND your husband need to sit her down and tell that although you love her, it's very hard for you to entertain her and take care of the baby.  Maybe she would like to babysit for you (this may poop her out) so you can have some time to yourself?  But you BOTH need to stand up because it's not going to get any better.  You need to set boundaries.|`|q8R3sr0caa	Simple. Lock your doors and windows and just tell her no... You don't HAVE to open the door when she comes over. If she calls, tell her your to busy for company and if she comes over anyways don't let her in, you said you were busy. It's not that hard to lock a person out of your own house. I would, since she's so horrible to you anyways.|`|YM1zhtKEaa	Stand up for your self don't take NO for an answer It is time for you to put a stop to this now   Thank her for any help that she has done but you think that you can handle raising your family. if that doesn't work make very uncomfortable for her to be there find what pushes her buttons and push them .  She can't eat you
CzdxFiRLaa	Hi beautiful pregnant mum,<br>  <br>  The Family Court in Australia will make a decision on custody, property, maintenance and the like if the two parties can not come to an agreement.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately often agreements are quite difficult to arrange.  As for the marital home, (I gather your Dad has or is moving out) can not be sold from under your mother and the children.  The only grounds for divorce in Australia is 12 months separation, so unless there is a prior agreement, big ticket items like a house is not finalised until the time of the divorce.  Getting legal advice is the best option for your mother as every situation is different and requires objective and professional advice.<br>  <br>  As for the mortgage, it is in joint names so form the bank's perspective, both are responsible for the payments until the mortgage deeds are changed.  <br>  <br>  Separation and divorce is a trying time for everyone involved, try and stay out of the debates and arguments, remember you are pregnant, and be there to support your Mum when she needs it.<br>  <br>  I hope it works out as well as possible...<br>  <br>  David|`|NLEmQZSsaa	yes you mu can buy his half or she can try and get the court to have father continue to pay mortgage since he is the one who wants out of marriage.  Or both can sell sell house and split any equitiy to get their own home.
Uj5kuzoJaa	Don't worry, she'll get hers.|`|Y9t9oJm5aa	Because shes a slut, and I totally believe in Karma, what goes around comes around, she is either going to fall in love and get hurt or one of those wives are going to do something horrible to her, dont worry she will get hers!|`|uTdEdpAeaa	no guy is worth that much aggravation for... any man that a capable of doing something that involves being unfaithful is not worth the time... especially not your life... c'mon, there are a lot of men out there and good men at that. see it in a way like him making the g/f or wife realize that she deserve better and is better off. if it's going to happen, better to happen sooner then later.|`|G02vO6Jwaa	you just need to keep faith that she will get hers one day. trust... it will happen and she will regret what she has done.|`|nSUHvlyaaa	hmm well remember too it's the men's fault, i mean a woman can only seduce you but it's their responsibility to remain faithful to their women. So it's more the men who ruin their women's lives. but things always catch up to people..|`|OBCvewW2aa	Did you ever stop and think that maybe karma is getting YOU for the atrocities you committed in a past life?        I wish you dingbats who get cheated on would stop screeching about karma.|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	First may I say punctuation is a good thing you should try it.   Second, anyone killing their selves over a sillyass man has got serious issues. They don't need to be dating, they need to be seeing a therapist.  Thirdly, it takes two to date, so she isn't the only guilty party here. Do you really want a man shallow enough to go out with a woman who only wants him for his money? How pathetic is he?|`|ULLDjjHZaa	god doesn't allow it. she caused it. she needs to stop.|`|4b26cb1a8069288001778a663299498baa	God gave us free will.

As long is not ur men,u keep ur men away from her.she'll get only what she deserves.which is nothing! scrubs like her end up with absolutely nothing.|`|JHYwzWSbaa	because god is not real|`|HaeDqxuyaa	I believe god gave everyone free will and decision making is more of a punishment and not a attribute, so keep faith in God and keep the devil at your feet and God will see you through.|`|xzl9njBXaa	GOD has the say so on who gets what and when they get it. She has to be good at what she is doing.When you find a duck who can pull a truck,old people say,"Hook em up".Meaning if they are not smart enough to read the signs life throws their way,then the obvious will happen.Worry more about your friend than the other person,and try to concentrate on your relationship before you get blindsided because of your inability to channel your focus on IMPORTANT issues,which have everything to do with you.
DDAvbocSaa	i was totally in love with my ex for 3 years and never even looked at another woman, no other woman would have come close, physically or emotionally. i never flirted or cheated on her or any other girl i've been in love with.|`|BUET39wmaa	WRONG  men always flirt     but it is harmless unless it goes further so don't sweat it|`|pJQd5Rxwaa	I think the question should be do men even know what true love really is in the first place?|`|hz0I0zFWaa	Sorry your not even close.|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	No, flirting is natural. Some people do it a lot and think nothing of it. As long as it's JUST flirting and nothing more, it's no big deal.|`|4a3a7d2a2bd6aa1d3814d6d9e39a668daa	um,,, guys always tend to flirt but u shouldnt worry about it... its a guy thing i guess...|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Men need the attention, they flirt all the time. It is only when he has a bad day, and the girl returning the flirtatious behavior decides she will do whatever it takes to keep the man; that it all goes south.|`|qmsgEJIwaa	He might not yet know what love is but he might think and say he is in love but still feel insecure in himself  and so might like and need attention from other ladies. You can't really be in love until you love yourself and that comes with maturity and maturity usually isn't linked to flirting with others in a committed relationship. My husband flirts I'm sure on occassion and he does love me but I'm sure he wouldn't give another lady the wrong idea. So it depends on what you mean by flirt. Some of it can be harmless.|`|FIV3ClQsaa	no he can still flirt even if he is truly in love.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	Men will always flirt and look, its in their nature. No matter how much they love a woman other women will still appeal to them. Now, if he actually takes action and cheats on you he is not worth your time. I have, however, heard of men who are deeply in love still cheating. I get the feeling that men are by nature polygamists.|`|15ad66d7bc3151bfa1bbf08f596456caaa	I look at this way.  In a relationship or not flirting is natural no matter if your in love or not - you love her or him your not dead.
AuWPMH44aa	the best thing is to move on. try dating again. You cant keep sitting around waiting for him. Keep yourself busy. things that wont make you think of him.

Start new hobbies or put yourself into old hobbies more fully. For a while you might just have to live in the moment. Another good thing is make a list of all the things you are going to do in a week without much time to be by yourself. Try not to dwell on the thought.|`|Ly2pvbfcaa	I'm going through a very similar situation right now. My advice it to get involved with things that you really enjoy. Get passionate about something and channel all your energy into making yourself happy. Don't forget that time heals and there are millions of people in this world.

But i have learned if you love some one so what love them. If you need to get over them time will only tell if you can. Chances are you are probably in love in the mean time hang out with your girls party it up and live it up while making that boy see what he is missing.

gWN7cZzmaa	yes, you are right. ditch him. When a guy lets you down like that, he doesn't even care for you. If anything he's keeping you around to use you whenever he feels "horny." but you should just cut him off out of the blue and give him a taste of his own medicine. And after that, start living the single life. When you least expect it, that one guy will enter you life. A guy you will appreciate you and never take you for granted. Someone who cares and the last thing on their mind is to hurt you in any way shape of form. But seriously, the best thing to do is end it with this guy. I don't know you, but no one deserves this, and you don't either. The best thing you can do is look in the mirror in the morning and tell yourself i'm too good for that bastard. And then just end it. If anything he doesn't even deserve a last goodbye..just ignore him..he'll get the hint after a few days.

We6rY8ynaa	You should definitely go to the doctor. It sounds to me that if you are not pregnant then you may have a cyst or fibroid blocking something. They can be very painful and the nausea also is common with this. I hope this helps- just don't delay going to a doctor, it can make it a lot worse. It is really simple to treat if you don't put it off for too long.|`|lsZDiqavaa	I think you should go to your Doctor for your answer, Cause you could be pregnant.

We're bitchier but they are meaner.|`|6DGLxJ1daa	It's possible that they are taking you for granted and walking all over you because you're not standing up for yourself when they're being mean and calling them out on it... that's my problem.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Because some guys are just mean and abusive.

There is no way you are really a bad boy, you have just got a childish hang up about the image.  When you grow up a bit you will realise that it's much nicer, and easier to be nice.  So start right now and get to know the girl you like at church.  Everyone has parents and you'll just have to live with that.  Let your good side flourish because there is nothing so unattractive as rudeness.|`|3vJoA7bzaa	I would never marry a bad boy.|`|blirKov3aa	why?sometimes law is ok!|`|fWBLCPX2aa	No one is a bad boy, just go to your sisters church you will learn how to behave and right up there you will find a good girl together you will oneday make a wonderfull husband to a good girl.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	my first husband was a bad boy, and i loved him dearly. but he wasn't a good husband, didn't like to work, it caused us to have money problems. my family really got upset when i married him, and they were right to feel the way they did. it ended in divorce, he moved on to another girl who got a welfare check, where he didn't have to work. my ex never got along with my parents either.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Girls might want to go out with a bad boy for a thrill, but they don't usually marry them.

st9KHhoKaa	my ex boyfriend was a sociopath and a drug addict..he had me that controlled and i stayed with him besides the abuse, the cheating, the lies, the drugs because they know how to get into your mind, and use it to their advantage. <br>  <br>  there are some very clever, fkced up people out there that get pleasure out of other peoples pain and dont care who's heart they break because its all about THEM..and getting recognition from their friends, to make THEM feel better and they dont care because it always will be, ALL ABOUT THEM. <br>  <br>  i stayed around because i had no where to run to, emotionally or pychologically.|`|haCssg2Laa	depends on the level of controlling<br>  <br>  if its<br>  where are you going? i dont want you to go, i want you to stay here, then thats because they love you, and trust can be earned<br>  <br>  but if its way more than that, ie-i dont WANT you to go, you CANT go, you cant wear this, you cant talk to xxxx, then thats irrational, and probably wont go|`|z2cysiEhaa	Love and respect for another, is not control or possession.

But it should be about what's happening (or not happening) in the relationship rather than because you like some other guy.<br>  <br>  Once you have ended your relationship, then you can look at starting a new relationship with this other guy IF he is single. I'm sure you wouldn't want your boyfriend flirting with other girls while you're going out; you should show the same courtesy to others. Besides, if this guy would start dating you while he's with the other girl, how do you know he won't do the same to you down the road.|`|JvbvGtrBaa	umm<br>  i don't know girl<br>  i thought i loved this other guy that turned out to dump me cause i got pregnant and not sure who that dad was. <br>  now the real true colors show. my boyfriend is the one that is really there to support me no matter what i choose. hes the real man i need in my life.  he may not be the funest extravagent friendliest social guy but he is devoted to doing what he possibly can do to make us happy. that playboy that seemed to be perfect....notso perfect. he was alot fun and lust spoiling me but the coward was never completely honest with me either  <br>  think twice before you make the same mistake.<br>  i wish he would have told me before we made love that he would dump me for having a baby. i would have never loved him i would have walked away knowing why and not regretting a thing. honest to god we talked about moving with eachother and me leaving my man and we could be happy and make it even talked about growing old together. he said he was beging to love me so much he'd pay my bills and bamb. i didn't see him giving me such altumatum. as soon as he gave it all to me he took it away. all the luxeries and love. if i don't get an abortion he can't fogive me  for making him daddy when he not ready of course he never mentioned that when things were so perfect. so just becareful. <br>  regardless how u feel about abortion you never know when the true colors are going to show until it's too late.<br>  take your time with this guy he'll understand if he loves you don't just up and leave you man sometimes you don't know what you got until it's gone<br>  unless your ready and completely over this guy then let him go for the sake of knowing you two are doomed but otherwise think twice before you get screwed don't rush into things, your emotions are on the table. don't loose this hand|`|D2g0XSLTaa	dont worry about dumping bf, he just read your post.  he's not sad trust me.  don't punish yourself, go after the new guy  - his gf saw you hugging and got pissed.  now you will have no one.<br>  don't punish yourself.|`|p7CCJx1raa	(ur bf) let him down gently and just say i just dont think its going to work out :(  im sorry i dont wnt to hurt you at all.|`|dWwrZs6Aaa	how would you feel if you got with this guy and he just dumped you of another girl. think about that|`|SFu6L2Ghaa	Okay so....

y0GOP487aa	Because at fourteen we dudes have a HUGE ego. So when we get rejected its a massive blow to our pride. Next time you reject somebody, don't reject them. Instead tell them your going out at the moment.|`|ktq7lF81aa	geez... chill... 14 is too young to be worrying about this.|`|gX8WIPNFaa	guys naturally get jealous so if they don't know the guys you talk to then they are gonna get thoughts in their heads...let them know from the start that nothing will ever happen with the guys you talk to and there is nothing to worry about|`|s4toXmgWaa	Yeah that can be tough. I remember when I was 14 it was kinda hard to be friends with a girl because yeah, i usually liked them and wanted to be more. thats just the way alotta young guys are. <br>  <br>  It sucks that your previous boyfriends got very jealous, and I'm glad that you were able to stop them from trying to take control of your social life like that.<br>  <br>  To sum it all up, since im a guy and not a girl, I can really only explain why alot of the guys ask you out, but that does get crazy that you have a hard time getting guy friends. Maybe to start take a look at your activities and social situations.<br>  <br>   Are you involved in a lot of afterschool activities and such that are usually only oriented for girls?(cheerleading, girl-oriented clubs, etc...) At 14 i remember all I wanted to do was skateboard, play video games, and hang out outside and listen to metal. Chances are if you hang around a skatepark or just places more young-guy oriented, then you will run into more guys to socialize with. Frankly though, its also because you are just still very young, once you get to high school and college, meeting guys as friends will get alot easier. I'm just friends with alot of girls and yeah its definately easier and more laid back than it was in middle and high school.
JC711xOqaa	Don't listen to the person above me. Sometimes opposites do attract, so they do work out in some cases. <br>  <br>  I would definitely date someone who's exactly similar to me as long as he isn't similar to me like he's my brother or any male in my family. The important thing is that you guys understand each other and are able to tolerate each other. I would rather marry a guy who's similar to me and have a long lasting (everlasting, for the better) marriage with him than to marry a guy who isn't similar to me and have a short-lived marriage with him. <br>  <br>  How much do you know about this guy? Date him and see if he's meant to be or if he's really the one for you. Give him hints that you're interested in him and see how he reacts or if he feels the same way about you.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	Opposites DO NOT attract. You should date him for sure, it's so rare to find someone that is on the same page as you. I'm telling you this from experience with relationships like the one you described and relationships where we were opposites.<br>  <br>  Edit: Don't listen to the girl below me, opposites DO NOT LAST.... You want someone who can understand where you're coming from.
VjgIeIMgaa	eh hes just feelin the pinch of losing money. he prob hesitates thinking about the money then thinks of u and thinks but its worth it.|`|n3PE2lvDaa	It probably annoys him being your sugar daddy. I would try and pay more or else do things together that dosnt cost much money like go on a picnic instead of going out to lunch or get a dvd instead of going to the movies. Dont expect a man to pay your way through life if you dont make enough money to help out when you do stuff then you need to do cheaper things together. Its a matter of pride.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	you just asked this question !|`|t3G5xSbIaa	well i think maybe he doesn't make that much money or is greedy that's why, anyways a guy is supoose to pay for the girl its not a girl who pays for the guy!|`|MJyM1XWJaa	maybe he is financially strained. my bf and i talked about finances and budgets and I told him that I'd rather know what is affordable than have him quietly trying to handle it on his own.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Sweetie, you've posted this question 4 times now I think? Give it a rest.|`|AQvBQHy4aa	ask him and you'll find out<br>  its best you know these things before you get married|`|9QF6GGyiaa	He actually may be a little annoyed. Doesn't mean he doesn't love you or  doesn't want to be with you! Maybe you should just hang out at one anothers and try to spend little money as possible? Try talking to him an telling him how you feel. If I were you I'd feel uncomfortable so I would definitely talk to my bf. Give him a thank you letter or card or something small letting him know you appreciate him taking you out. Hope that helps a little =). .|`|iCbTXFBvaa	He hesitates, cuz he loves you!

You could be a high maintaince chick, in which he should dump you|`|WL1cX9rTaa	only if he doesnt feel your giving him enough love or spending enough time.. no man wants to buy and eat dinner with a girl that deosnt want to be with him. love on him some more and he will do more then buy you dinner and be happy to do so.|`|tB6f7kguaa	well you could offer to pay every once in a while....if he says no it's his own fault, and I am also a full time student, but I have a part time job also...just saying lol

iZDsMCghaa	For the most part. The same way a man can be large and be a horrible lover, a man can be smaller than average and be the best you have ever had!  HOWEVER, I have had one experience with a man who was too small, for real.  He couldnt thrust. He could only grind. This was very frustrating, I wasnt even able to fake it but I felt for him.

A guy whose only agenda is to get in your pants would have been long gone.  <br>  <br>  Don't feel sheepish, relax and enjoy the ride..........|`|ghvU8CsOaa	I totally agree with Aaron M. See how long he sticks around. Make the first move when you're ready. :)
am7Ykwqiaa	Just say hi and smile. Sounds like she's just as keen to talk to you as you are to her. A warm smile goes a long way.|`|FE0PRaJnaa	smile and ask her how she is. She seems keen to talk to you, so you shouldn't have any trouble. Just relax and have a one to one conversation with her. good luck!
2vZDuIahaa	You are no longer a virgin. A virgin is someone who has not had a penis in them. Even if he did not ejaculate, that doesn't mean you are a virgin. Sorry but no. For other guys, they might think you are, but technically you are not.|`|ZzEAc5ecaa	i am sorry .. but the answers is no ..|`|04d81c107f433cebb6371d36ae227a9baa	yes you are ....... most definitely|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	well if that was the first time you had sex .. yes .. if you can't remember you don't need to be having sex..  how old are you 14.. hope you know about pre ***.. unless he had a condom or your on birth control  on you can still get pregnant.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Nope. <br>  <br>  You may not even have a hymen anymore. Many break theirs at a young age. It doesn't matter if he ejaculated, he still "entered" you.<br>  <br>  Sorry, but you're not a virgin anymore.|`|qy07K2k5aa	No, I don't think you're considered a virgin anymore.|`|ZATeGhkbaa	Who cares.|`|LIUsQtLqaa	No, a virgin is specified as being someone who has never been penetrated vaginally by a penis. If you have been penetrated, even if it was only for a second, you are no longer a virgin.|`|frN73zikaa	No, with your statement you are no longer a virgin in the eyes of God and Man,<br>  <br>  But to who ever come to sex with you again will see u as a virgin if he‚Äôs not told of this.|`|zRkTwsawaa	The answer is definately no so far his penis penetrated at all. It doesn't matter if he ejaculated or not since you even feel it before telling him to stop. Sorry to say this but you are disvirgined.|`|ilG7IV0aaa	no i dont think so once its gone in a bit its gone in.<br>  <br>  answer my q? <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AtCPEg8ClbH_hWlP9_o.DlXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090220021229AACqYCO">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  and could guys imparticular answer this?|`|qGsKJe2Iaa	No|`|ND1nFEWSaa	yes
2f2338425d995c6d00e32cb38d57ee7faa	Yes, a lot of people are frustrated with dating sites. Keep trying. There will be many more false starts and failed attempts than genuine relationships, but all it takes is one right person - just one. You might meet her within a month or two, or it might take you several years. It took me 4 years of (online) dating to meet my husband, and I'm happy I was persistent and didn't give up.    I had a lot of people respond to my online ads, but obviously I didn't write every single person back. Several things played a role in deciding whether to respond to someone:     - The initial message: it helps if you customize your introductory message instead of spamming the same cookie-cutter message to every half-way suitable match. When it's "spammy", it shows. Mention something that caught your eye in their profile. When you show that you pay attention, you are more likely to catch their attention.    - Your profile: put your best foot forward, but don't lie. Think about a woman you would like to meet, and come up with a list of traits that you possess that this woman would find attractive. Try to describe your unique mix of traits that make you "you"; saying that you're "honest, loyal and like to laugh" isn't helpful - this is what everyone else says; try to think of something memorable to say. Are you physically active, do you have a favorite sport? Are you more of an intellectual? Are you a music fan? Do you have an artistic streak? A unique hobby? An expertise in some fascinating field? Have you visited any interesting places lately? What are your dreams, goals and aspirations? Be more personal, and try to tailor your description to the kind of individual you're looking for. This said, try not to mention anything in your profile that might sound negative, cynical and the like. No need to describe your past relationships, your ex-wife, or your disillusionment with love. Be positive. (And choose a flattering photo of yourself.)    - Spelling and grammar. Inability to communicate well can be a deal-breaker. Run a spell check and take care to use proper grammar and punctuation. Details matter.    - Be proactive. If you feel you and the gal you're talking to hit it off, ask her out. Show your interest. Yes, you might get rejected; but it's a risk you must be willing to take. Don't wait for her to call you - call her.    - Be yourself. Not all women you're interested in will be interested in you, and dead-ends are to be expected. Be confident in yourself, in what you have to offer. Quiet confidence has great power. Do what you must to boost your confidence - read more, work out, keep up with current events. Being able to converse on different subjects makes you interesting. Having diverse interests makes you interesting. Bottom line is, more often than not, things don't work out. You have to be able to dust yourself off, learn from the experience and keep going. It only takes one "right" person.|`|aDIPIu7xaa	"It seems whenever there is a good woman online with everything most guys wants she is too busy to respond"      Good women can afford to be choosy.    That's why!|`|6fce40fc087ca94205e0e0e2743c64f5aa	this is marriage and divorce.. next time try single and dating... geez...|`|8758df9720f7d094342fbcef3c91a629aa	When I was single, I found that most dating sites were geared around making money not getting two people together.  Try the free sites and see if you have the same results.  Good Luck|`|5ViTUTyZaa	Women will literally get HUNDREDS of responses to their ad from men.  So you have to consider that.|`|bO2rzfISaa	I decided not to put my picture up because men hit on me all the time and I didn't want a guy who chose me for my appearance.  I responded to the men who contacted me and it was theirs to lose. I declined to send a picture even at that point. I think I ruled out shallow men with this tactic.I met three men and married one. We've been married 11/2 years.    If women are "flaking out" it's because they think you aren't a good match.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	You need to just get out more and meet people in person. People online tend to lie about things..
LcRKHa0Gaa	Stop thinking it's all about you. You obviously think a lot about yourself to think that your teacher (?) who is married and has two little girls (?) likes you? That's just stupid man. You need to grow up and realise the truth in this world.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Accept her "guidance" and ask for "extra homework" to help you make up some of those english assingnments. Getting a good grade the easy way rules!|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Sounds like shes hitting on you for sure ! I say if you really want to then just go for it ! But if you're not comfortabe with the idea then don't !<br>  <br>  XxX|`|W8aiAWe2aa	DO NOT go round her house. If you do you are asking for trouble.<br>  Are you reading too much into this?<br>  Either way she is a teacer and you are student. Enough said!!!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	i hope you flunk.|`|aztQDdMXaa	just like ike from south park lol<br>  have fun!<br>  =>_<=|`|zka26204aa	Do not under any circumstances get involved with that!!  Her husband might kill you if he found out.  Besides, if you do, she has you by the nuts.  If you refuse to be at her beckon call, she can threaten to fail you.  Just tell her that you forgot that you had other plans, but if she could suggest some additional work that will help, you would appreciate it if she would write it down, so that you can do it in your spare time.  If she keeps coming on to you and you are afraid of your grades, report her to the school for harassment.  (Don't sleep with her and then try to do it.  You are likely to be kicked out as well, if you willingly participated.)  You are well within your rights to expect to get an education without being sexually harassed.<br>  <br>  My ex husband was a professor at a local college.   He did that to a girl in his class.  She reported it, and he was asked to quit or he would be fired.|`|EgNgEVaRaa	write script to a pono flick lol<br>  or try changing classes<br>  or talk to pricnipal/dean<br>  or switch schools<br>  or leave early <br>  or do her<br>  or don't do her<br>  or tell her your not interested in a polite way<br>  or ignore it|`|PVb3iiaAaa	woow umm i wud probably quit the class and stay the f*** away from that lady!!!! dude she gon rape u foshoz!!!! sooo unless u lik that stuff.....then leave the class and dnt speak to that teacher o ver myspace or im or txt or anything else!!!!|`|fnBPI4OAaa	Weird!!!!!!!!!!! Don't pursue it. Don't wreck a family. Keep away, don't let it jeopardise your grades.|`|6fwEF5ATaa	It depends, Some married women like misleading younger guys. <br>  <br>  Give it a try at your own risk.|`|FzFSzilmaa	ah, the classic student daydream...<br>  <br>  you really should concentrate on your studies... :D|`|VEgv5NhSaa	well, like you said she has 2 girls and she might be doing it by accident|`|QKoWmn3maa	jus do it with her!!<br>  then l8r ask her for good grades|`|UrE9xvliaa	i would stay away from that whole situation if I were u...she is a teacher and married and has children...she is probably just "flirting" with u to get attention from a younger man to see if she still has it or something or her relationship could be going through a rough spot or something...seems like alot of people including yourself could get hurt..i don't think its worth it...|`|vb6nB7ANaa	sounds like you want her abit to the way you explain her decently young in good shape blond hair?So maybe she does you cant do anything let her want you unless you want her to then its a problem do you want her??|`|vwgmh3v6aa	Well there is a like 14 years between you but like, just let her do that dont let that get in your way. Get on with the work and leave her be to chat you up.|`|SIUIleCzaa	Dude go for it....it not everyday that milfs actually come up to you and want you....you'll be able to tell that story for years to come...plus if she is giving you a time and place is cuz it's just gonna be you two...|`|14WkRpWuaa	She gave you the offer cause she saw you with dress on; i bet she wudnt touch ya once you undress in her condo - cause stupid and lying people have a different body structure than normal ones. LOL.|`|6DVzpa1Caa	do what you wanna do do what you feel|`|i9gfJIXgaa	Dude definitely go for it...... You would be telling this story for decades....you miss 100 percent of the shots you dont take|`|lb8FBhWnaa	It sounds kinda weird...but she might just want to help you.|`|yeKGxyXCaa	yeah right this is BS|`|Zj9pycyUaa	yo i would tap that a**|`|p1ySkjSNaa	Dude... you're gay if you don't pursue this. I'm currently working at my TA in my African History course ; )|`|AQPdi1KUaa	ask her if her daughter is seeing anyone?|`|dAKgZr7Xaa	I cant even understand why you are asking this, maybe being egotistical?  <br>  <br>  She would put her job, her future, her marriage on the line for some pimply freshman?  LOL, you have gotta be kidding.<br>  <br>  Besides, you can tap into fresh V!!  V isn't like cheese, it doesn't get better with age mate, far from it.<br>  <br>  Fifteen years shes been sopping it up, and you even think it is a good idea?  Why risk some STD with an old and mouldy?  Maybe an Oedipus complex?<br>  <br>  You should ask her what she really wants, and if its amorous activities, report her... why, cos this is YOUR chance to gain the tools required for your adult life, and she just wants to use you, abuse you, then dump you, as it suits her.  She is a 24 caret ****.
FOQqDyLFaa	if its hurting you this much and you feel this strongly you should tell him! the worst thing he can do is reject you and even if that happens at least you'll know where you stand and can try to forget him and move on.... so just GO FOR IT because you never know what might happen....!!!  good luck!|`|9MZ7Gygdaa	You have to remember the good times!    Try to talk to him a bit more if you see him. Not in a flirty way, but if you spend a lot of time together and his relationship fails, you have a chance. Also if this ever happens to be the case (And i know you dont want it to happen) If he does get married, you will be a close friend of his, and you will still talk.     You two sound like you connect really well. Talk to him, and enjoy the time you have together. Dry those tears! All is well! :)|`|tzmce3x8aa	How old are you? If your in school, don't worry, it won't last long xD    If your like, older and what-not, tell him how you feel =D|`|cFktUueyaa	If he liked you like you love him, then he wouldn't have a girlfriend. I think you are getting strung along hun. I mean all that other stuff sounds nice, but at the end of the day, it's her HE'S thinking about. I think you have to cut this b4 you get hurt anymore|`|aLgY4l3Naa	"IF YOU LOVE SOMETHING SET IT FREE, IF IT COMES BACK IT WAS YOURS, IF IT DOESN'T IT NEVER WAS" There is nothing you can do but step back and let things happen the way they will! For what ever reason he ended up with another girl and not you, so at this point you need to except this and move on, if things were meant to be between you two then it will happen, but for now you need to respect him and his choice to be with someone else!! I wish you luck and i hope you can learn to be happy and move on, don't dwell on this too much because it will kill you!!|`|qegWdsNLaa	Seriously, I think you need to try to get over this.  He has a girlfriend.  Trying to steal him away from her is not cool.  On the other hand, if you just wait on the sidelines hoping that they break up someday, that's not only creepy, but it'll tear you apart from the inside.  The best thing is to try to move on.|`|UJZPNHpFaa	I was like this with my boyfriend. He was with this girl for 6 months after we started talking and stuff! I just kept at it. I called him like every night and talked to him forever. I invited him to places to hang out with me and my friends or sometimes just me. I even asked him to my homecoming and he came! He broke up with her shortly after and now we've been together for 3 years. If you want something bad enough, you'll have it. And if it's meant to be, it will happen!!!!! GOOD LUCK GIRL!  =]|`|0LEFco9xaa	In this situation you really only have two options. If you feel that strongly about him you need to tell him. He might reject you and that will hurt trust me I know that can hurt so bad but he also might say that he feels the same way. Your other option is if your not willing to say anything because your scared you need to try to put up with the situation or distance yourself if you can't. If you feel its worth it to fight for the situation the put up the fight. Good luck!|`|m99D31vTaa	Wow, I'm going through the same. But look if you really love him TALK TO HIM . Stop wasting time & go talk to him. Tell him you dont wanna ruin your friendship but you need get it out you. Look don't hold things in, if you do it'll be too late & you'll regret it. GO HUN =}|`|fdca1ea504e38c4671e7e27df57d072aaa	I'm not trying to be insensitive, but if shortly after you two became close, he got a g/f then he doesn't see you as anything but a friend. Some guys have a way of being really nice and sensitive and they're not trying to lead you on, but they do anyway. A lot of guys like that don't know how to draw the line sometimes. Cut your losses and move on to someone who is single and who can reciprocate your feelings.|`|12xQlgr7aa	Normally I would've tried to talk you into toughening up and holding from possibly breaking the other girls heart. But reading what you just wrote, you've won me over. I say you tell him what you just wrote, because a love as strong as yours is hard to find. Im gonna keep my fingers crossed for you. Good Luck :-)|`|1w2qIXmyaa	Same as your situation. I can't figure it out too you know. Loving someone so much makes them very hard to forget. I have to admit it too... Maybe that is why I'm still stock in the dark pretending I'm ok.    Well, my advice... You have to be stronger, if you can't hold on then there's no choice but to let go. It's painful and a thousand tears will fall. But if you two were really meant to be then whatever happens you know that you two will be couples on the further future.    Seems hard huh? But be stronger that's just all I can say.    Take Care ok.
OxnFnyqPaa	What about any other cafe? <br>  There must be some other cafe other than starbucks at where you live, <br>  right?<br>  Coffee and cake are always nice, but don't you think escalating to kissing her would scare her off? I mean, it's just your first date, I don't know, but I wouldn't want a guy kissing me on our first date.<br>  But if the kiss comes from her then I guess it's okay.<br>  Just don't initiate anything! She'll think you are just after that! <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|QFf9phAmaa	you met her in a bar then why you fear? of course at a bar it is also a place for a first date and the girl herself know a place for you.|`|7kF26l4jaa	have a picnic<br>  i gotta say best date idea ever<br>  the girl will see how much effort you put into doing it<br>  and it will matter<br>  girls think about that sort of thing<br>  also make sure the food is the most awsomest awsome food ever in that basket<br>  :]|`|P7mYy4CFaa	comedy club|`|upIrlDm5aa	In bed|`|wE2etBzbaa	In a park-<br>  <br>  -ing lot|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	coffeeshop is okay, especially if there's outdoor seating, and if you meet around/after sunset. they're not so crowded then.<br>  <br>  parks are nice, bring some snacks and a blanket and have a get to know you picnic.<br>  <br>  if you're near the beach, same thing<br>  <br>  have her over! cook something for her...have a movie day/night . popcorn's cheap!<br>  <br>  that's about all i can think of on short notice.|`|AA10706358	Amusement Park..<br>  you can have a lot of fun, walk a bit<br>  and should I tell you when and where to Kiss or you got it already !?|`|am7Ykwqiaa	Grab a coffee.

RKsn5dD4aa	fried chix, potato salad, mac n' cheese, corn, roles, and cake.  also veggie tray and fruit and cheese tray.   we are doing a very casual reception at a bar.|`|sGP6s7uraa	Ours is just casual finger foods.  We're having chicken strips with sauce, pinwheel sandwiches, shrimp cocktail, fruit tray, veggie tray, cheese and crackers.|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	For dinner we will be having a stuffed chicken breast, crab cakes & prime rib buffet.  One of our sides will be fettucine alfredo which could get messy, but I felt it was a 'must' because the main entrees wouldn't appeal to a vegetarian and I wanted to have something else in the lineup that would be filling but satisfactory to a vegetarian.    I want good tasting food that isn't so unusually prepared that I wouldn't eat it myself (I'm a pretty fussy eater).    I have to agree, BBQ sauce at a wedding would be a recipe for stains.  Try to avoid sauces or anything that would be too messy.|`|AA11603468	We had grilled chicken breast, mahi mahi with pineapple salsa, broccoli, rice, green salad--unintentionally a very healthy meal! For dessert, we chose key lime pie and chocolate cake.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	Were getting married in October around Canadian Thanksgiving. So we're having turkey dinner with carrots, peas, turnip, dressing and gravy. Followed by a selection of Newfoundland berry tarts for dessert. ( Bake apples, Blue berries and partridge berries)|`|qLAEOqJNaa	teriyaki chicken and steak is what me and mark want.  hope that helps :)|`|5WnOOO28aa	well it depends are they appetizers if they are you can get shrimp, baby keish and something else and if you need it for the dinner you can get chicken cord om blue its great and fast to make and they sell it at walmart or your local food store you can also use just plain chicken , fish is all cheap and great for weddings|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	At my wedding, I'm having a meat and cheese tray with freshly baked rolls for people to make sandwiches with. We're also having a variety of salads (pasta salad, green salad, potato salad etc.) & fruit trays. Those are simple and easy ideas and you can make it all yourself.

FzHqYO3faa	blondhair,talkchav,nicepersonality,boobs... and some jeans and some nice trainers... skinny|`|kFlMHSKIaa	Nail varnish - or gloves to hide your man-sized hands.|`|AFGxrXSyaa	are you a cross dresser?|`|2GW5UDJPaa	Blonde hair.<br>  Speak like someone is yanking on your jacobs.<br>  And make everything you ask into a question.
ZUL3drNgaa	yay go Mrs. O =>|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	You love her more because she lost 10 lbs?? Wow she's so lucky.|`|qmsgEJIwaa	No you should tell her the truth. If you like her a little thinner make sure she knows. Sometimes when I have gained a few pounds I hate that my husband pretends he doesn't notice. When I am at the gym and looking good he always treats me better.|`|XzHjeFKYaa	That mean you really dont love her... just her looks..     But you should be happy for her and support her.  For her.. not you.|`|a9OwtN7faa	YES! are you insane! you never say such a thing to a woman and if you feel you must do it in a way where it does not sound so harsh.    By you telling her that, you are letting her believe that you only love her outer beauty and this alone will lead her to feel ashamed and alone when she feels thinks shes not up to standards.|`|KadJyjtBaa	Women arent like men, we cant go all the time trying to live up to a macho image. We struggle and are vulnerable. We are percieved as weak so we have to work harder to prove to ourselves and others that we can achieve all the things a man can and much more.   Working, pregnancy, raising children, keeping a marriage functional and dealing with her own personal struggles takes a toll on a woman. Be sensitive and dont laugh. I think you should tell her that you love her when she can give time for herself and her needs and that your proud of her. Its about her feeling your support and your love. Laughing at her even thou you dont have bad intentions can bring her self esteem down. Remember that in order for her to show love she needs to love herself too.|`|hGACxCwYaa	funny OF you... mmmm.. i'd say, honest.  however, were you open about her girth before?  because if so, i don't think she should take that into offense.|`|d20mM90uaa	good for her, just be her motivator and not a downer like my husband|`|BUET39wmaa	for christ sakes you don't say you love her more you stupid **** hole you tell her she is looking sexy and you like that she is looking after herself....|`|wGw834Gkaa	Did you tell her you are proud of her?  If you really said that it sounds like you only love her when she is doing well and that you will drop her like a hot potato if she ever gains weight.|`|rcut6bhoaa	Tell her with excitement in your voice how proud you are of her.  She will appreciate it at least.|`|qpAYU8Knaa	Not funny at all. You should love your wife no matter what.|`|ifcgmNV3aa	why dontcha join the gym as well so that she is more proud (i said more proud :D) of yeh?? haha|`|Bc4udMhUaa	funny, no. Telling her you're proud of her is another story, though also not funny.|`|pErRGYH7aa	Not funny, and may not be taken in the best light.  Why not telling her how proud you are, or just simply how much you love her, or how much more attractive you find her.  Don't base your love for her on her body mass.|`|0d0W0nbVaa	yeah, and she's humping her male group fitness instructor.. or maybe her personal trainer.|`|7ewzmiNEaa	You got your answer when she slapped your face  for that comment|`|263434b6fe9b827cbad3893e796d8d18aa	Not funny and certainly not a motivator, about the only thing that would actually motivate me to do is pack up my skinny clothes and leave to find a man who appreciates me for me. But telling her you are proud of her success is a great motivator.|`|XUSq0gHoaa	I'd be thinking the same way if I told my hubby the same thing you did. LOL! But I guess it just depends on the type of humor you posses. Well you and your wife. If it didn't bother her go ahead and have a little fun, but if she didn't like it one bit or got upset over it, then you better be going to the flower shop get some flowers and do some apologizing!|`|i1rDJY2aaa	No it wasn't. It was very shallow of you to even think that.
BeFneHRgaa	It's not wrong that you feel cheater.    I would expect a friend to be telling me these things too!    But considering where this information was found, if it was on her facebook profile, maybe it's just for show?    She probably doesn't want the kinds of people that see her facebook profile to think she's a prude or something.    However, I wouldn't confront her about it. Just start talking with her again more often and go out more. Eventually you'll build up enough of a friendship again for you guys to talk about these things more.    Dont give up on her x|`|i15KoiJhaa	It isn't wrong, you feel how you feel.    However, I cannot understand why you feel the way you feel?    Who knows if any of what she said on Facebook is real or not? People lie all of the time for various reasons... maybe she thought it made her look cool.    It is possible that she wasn't honest with you about her single status and again... people lie for various reasons (Not that it makes it right, but yea)    If you feel so strongly about it, then why not say to her "Dang girl! I didn't know you had a boyfriend!" see what she says...|`|2K6hHhUaaa	no not reallii  maybee theres somethin more to the story tho  dont worry bout her  at least you no that you cant always trust her and stuff  maybee just ask her i swear you told me u neve had a bf and just trii to make a joke outta it  good luck|`|SBBnWsJJaa	Maybe it's part of her on-line persona.|`|J6WSMpTlaa	Maybe she is lieing to all of her facebook viewers  or  She is lieing to u  just call her or e-mail if she really did that stuff she clamed she did    ASK
EdidZdtlaa	if you want to go then you should go and not let him hold you back.what i would do is confront him about it and ask him why he dosent want me to go with him because you've been going all this time.

82dR08wIaa	YIKES!  I guess it depends on the man.  Could go either way.  The person needs a good one to one talk with someone to atleast have an outlet for themselves.  I would have to wonder who it was he was thinking of killing because he can't find work, however aside from that, talk some common sense into the man, people have suffered and persevered through far greater circumstances in this country.  He is not alone in this failing economy and killing oneself or others is pus*y sh*t!   Contrary to misguided belief, prison food and a cot is not preferable to struggling as a free man.   This too shall pass.      (((squirt)))|`|LDBvgEG0aa	If he seems serious, yes.    It's in the news far too often.|`|FrLDHBLfaa	By the way the news looks lately, I'd say "yes".|`|znG94ACLaa	Yes many times its - goes very seriousely ........|`|AA11402921	I never really asked the man, but if I did he still knows im not ready to  I still have issues to deal with they'll know when I know and my knowing isn't time yet..|`|mqM3BhEnaa	he's a dangerous loser.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	If he threatens this - report him.    These days people seem to snap for no good reason at all.  Better safe than sorry.|`|dab789e5b4a1a16ddbbce112d0a6c7faaa	I wouldn't necessarily take chances.  With the economy down the drain (and awhile before it looks like it will get better) people are going to be more likely to "snap" under all of the stress.  Is he a man with a quick temper or someone more likely to go into depression?  Those are things also to consider.  I would advise maybe giving him advice, unless you think that he would be dangerous then maybe you should just offer your support and don't go near him unless others are around.|`|LsHkgexvaa	Stress and emotional instability can make people very dangerous. If you care about this person get them to seek mental health support. Depression, anxiety, and financial stress can make people dangerous to themselves and others. It sounds like he's looking to control something/somebody in his life because he's feeling out of control. Good Luck.|`|48eb36e954e65e920ed956735bed8684aa	Yes.    Recently a man here at my work (University of Washington) ran into the main quad and set himself **on fire** because he couldn't find a job.    Furthermore, even if he is NOT serious, he needs to learn that that kind of language is always taken seriously.|`|izY3JNhqaa	In normal times I would say no but in these perilous times I would say " Watch Heeeeem!!"      I've seen a big escalation in bank heists and all sorts of crimes ... they are even hitting the local Subway sandwiches so nothing is sacred.    Best thing to do is to avoid ALL humans at any cost.  They are all about to explode ... or ascend ... whichever the case may be ,... but many are exploding so BEWARE!    Peace  I AM '  Dartagnon|`|pw4Cb45Kaa	Yes, many people lose it and there has been many incidents where such threats do act out.  Take it seriously and report it to higher authorities.    GOD BLESS!|`|08H81poqaa	Yes, he should be taken seriously.  He is hurt and that little child within is screaming out.  This is going to be a common occurrence now.  He is snapping and his hurt and anger are raring their ugly heads.      People everywhere are going to be acting like this, be cautious where you step.      I am living for now, in the mountains of NC and people are buying guns to protect themselves.  I do not understand this, it is reactionary and this shows nothing but fear.      Compassion everywhere!  smile, laugh and hug people (this is to all out there reading)    He will figure it out and hopefully "wake up"    Peace.  Amanda|`|JDZdPo21aa	Eh, no. I would take the threat seriously though.    Have I missed something in the news? I didn't know Dubya was already even looking for new jobs.|`|b9dae40ef8a10998c029b6d46aa0359daa	That all depends, some people like to blow off like that for some strange reason, either way there is a huge energy imbalance and that is dangerous.|`|mU2eMSi3aa	Say, "Get a job man you suck," and then laugh at him while you point your finger and show everyone the silly freak boy with no job and no wee wee.  Ha ha ha, that's what I'd do.|`|zrz4bcalaa	Yes.  Take it seriously.|`|cFaCmYrXaa	Ugghhh.... I suppose there's always the possibility that a person can snap :(  I love you girl ((((((((sis))))))))|`|tBn75TOGaa	tell him you found a job for him that can really use the skills he has, one that pays really well.  Ask him if he minds having two secretaries and possibly a corner office.  then tell him 'just kidding' and run like hell|`|HBUjnOMEaa	No more than a monkey should be taken seriously about threatening to fling poo... (Sorry, 'I Fling Poo', I couldn't resist!)    My African Grey slung his seeds at the best of them! Who knows what the man might do?    It really all depends on how serious your question is, and I see you got a lot of serious answers. Knowing you, I think this category is outclassed.|`|cgfZSAtjaa	What a reason. Yes, maybe, he will be but, not in a good way!

The people at nudist venues are very nice, outgoing, and just super people.  We have an agreement amongst ourselves to try to make everyone as comfortable as possible when they come out to try nude recreation for the first time.  It is a matter of pride for us since we all remember how difficult it was the first time we stripped down in public.  Now we can't wait to get to the resort, take it off and live life free.  <br>  <br>  AND, contrary to what many, who don't know, say ... nude beaches while all ages will appear,  tend to have younger, physically fit people on them.  Some of the resorts, especially in Florida do have an older population, until you get to Paradise Lakes or Caliente Resorts, then you find a younger crowd.  <br>  <br>  You can call a resort and feel free to ask what the age range is on any given day or weekend, so if you don't feel like hanging with grand-dad you know not to go that day.  <br>  <br>  Or better yet, get a group of your friends together and make your own crowd that day.  <br>  <br>  Come on in, the water is fine.|`|qDWuMuwZaa	i strip, i dance in front of my wife especially if she is angry with me, i sing naked in front of the mirror while taking a shower, but i never get naked inside the house even am alone, my house has a lot of glass window my neighbor might see me. hehehe|`|0DdSoi4Maa	I LOVE being naked, it's one of the best feelings to me!!!

uI6fG9MQaa	First of all, if your DAD is teasing you then you need to tell your dad to grow the h3ll up and stop acting like a freaking immature child. And why do you even care if your brother teases you? . . . WHO CARES! Your whole entire family needs to GROW UP if their teasing you just because you have a girlfriend. Siblings will be siblings . . SO GET OVER IT!!!|`|cFktUueyaa	Act like a man. If they say something, say something back...at least  got a girlfriend. You dad and brothers shouldn't stop you from asking your dream girl out.|`|TyLBzdOnaa	hahaha they are not doing it to annoy you its just cute to see younglings in love. but if it does annoy you just tell them. If you are willing to ask a girl out to be your gf then telling your dad and bros to leave you alone shouldn't be hard compared to asking a girl to be your gf.|`|cduZnDE4aa	lol thats the beauty of getting a girlfriend...:P  get used to it cause itll never stop|`|QnAEEmB3aa	Wait, your DAD??? he's already done it before if im not mistaken and you brothers are just being asses, they all love you really. If you love her then the teasing is worth it.    hope this helps:)|`|12xQlgr7aa	Either don't tell them, or let them tease a little bit. You're dad is probably just enjoying the fact that you're growing up and he knows you'll be a lil embarrassed. Just dont care. DO NOT let that be the reason from letting the girl slip away. Laugh with them when they tease you, just dont let it get to u. They'll stop eventually.|`|3qY4hhuGaa	If you want my opinion, I say that you should follow what your heart is telling you, but don't be too rash.  Unlike the situation I'm involved in, it sounds like she's single.  You should let her know how you feel, but don't be too forward.  If you care for her, don't let what your family members think mess it up for you.  Just be honest with yourself.  Good Luck.|`|kW371HVMaa	all u have to do is not answer them just be like thats not funny.  ignore them or just walk away or change the subject|`|aDPOn62Yaa	Lol, I'm pretty sure the only reason they tease you is because they think young love is "cute". This is your dream girl, whenever they joke just be like "Yeah, I've got a girl and shes amazing.", it'll die down eventually.|`|TLgWwxN1aa	Don't tell them obviously
AA10199189	in the absence of a mum to talk to - find someone at school, say a guidance counsellor, who can find some help for you.    you think you can't relate, but you are going thru adolescence and it's hard.  lots of kids feel as you do, and their parents have no clue about how upset they are.  good luck|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Sorry you are having parental issues. Its hard enough to be 14, you dont need this as well.   Unfortunately, you dont get to pick your family like you can pick your friends.   Your parents probably still think of you as a child, not as an almost adult.   Think about sitting down with your Mom, when the two of you are alone, and say "Mom, our relationship sucks. I really dont want to spend the next 4 years counting the days when I get to move out of here. Can we talk about why we have such a poor relationship, and figure out how to make it better?" Before you do this, you need to make a list of what has disappointed you, and what you would like to change. Be careful, and dont list things that arent going to happen.   You only get one set of parents in this world, so you do need to try and mend things.|`|AA12396274	unfortunately we don't get to choose our parents, but you should try to figure out why things are this way,maybe he thinks you don't respect him either, 14 is a hard age|`|oZpqEdI7aa	1 word: FRIENDS-I've gone through the exact same thing and trust me, the next few years seem to last forever but friends help out alot. I was lucky enough to have friends to talk to(my best friend is my cousin). My anger and frustration was let out as soon as i was able to talk to my cousion. Its tough but you'll get through it
UobbhxSkaa	People are already saying there's no point any more, thats up for you to decide, but if you really want to give it up, I suspect you're going to have to tell someone about it and promise to them that you're going to stop. You know, the accountability thing.|`|6HS1ot35aa	Honestly, what I find to be a huge part of it is the fact that you live together already. As Christians I'm sure that you guys are aware that it is a sin to be living together as a couple before marriage, what more, you're already having sex. So, I think the best answer would be to put off living together until after you're finally married.|`|kzxYoqiUaa	if you cant keep your hands off each other then really dont be ashamed. think about it the whole idea is to not have sex before marriage but youve already dont it so too late now. besides saving yourselves for yourselves seems silly doesnt it? i would suggest holding off the last 2 weeks and maybe youll feel better. thats what alot of people do.|`|8c1f0faf3cfd3ea5332e16c457103692aa	You Christians make me laugh.<br>  It's human nature for goodness sake, why try to stop it?<br>  Sex is a wonderful thing to do with someone you love.<br>  You're going to let some book tell you how to run your life?<br>  It's not like you obey every single one of those rules/teachings, what harm could one more do?<br>  According to that same book, we're all sinners anyhow.<br>  Plus, you are getting married soon.<br>  So why stop having sex??!?!?!?!|`|ytGaDM7Haa	well your first problem is you live together ... duh<br>  second problem is you've already done it ... <br>  kinda seems too late. not that you shouldn't try if you feel it's right, but I don't know how it works from here on.|`|h9RCLfgWaa	Oh god...another religious nutcase..Dont worry there is no helping u.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	No need to stop now.|`|N0WLo5JVaa	THE BIBLE says that for have sinned and have come short of the glory of God.u have already disobeyed d law,defiling d bed b/4 marriage but ur remorse after doing it shows u still have the fear of God in ur hearts,God has 4given u but that is if u are willing 2 stop fornicating and not going back till marriage.nevertheless,u should look for some1 close 2 u and stay in d persons house for the mean time,that is if u guys really want 2 please God,talk 2 ur fiance and let him allow u stay with d person ,overlooking d financial side of it.what u are bent on doing is more important than financial issues.living together is a great temptation 2 ur fiance and urself.u need not d bible 2 tell us that.dont worry,as far as u guys are serious about having the fear of God in ur hearts,God has alraedy forgiven u.but,it will be betrayal 2 God 2 go back 2 ur vommits.space is the only solution to that.u will both enjoy urselves the more if u can deny urselves d pleasure for the mean time becos of God.it has been proven sowell that 99% of the people who defile d bed b/4 marriage are not enjoying their marriages 2day.i am a girl and i have vowed not 2 make love 2 d guy am gonna get married 2 till we are married so that we appear bold b/4 God on the alter with my white gown signifying purity,i know i will be happier standing face 2 face ,knowing he has'nt seen my nakedness yet.my dear u just go ahead and do it ,give urselves space and no touching ,petting and kissing from now till then,if u can do these,u are victorious then.lets not practise d worldly form of marriage,God is not happy with it and u know sin comes with punishment.leave the house and if he wants 2 see u,some1 else should be there also.wish u all the best! u can read 1cor chapter 6 to aid u more.|`|vGjxpHD9aa	Why do you want to stop having sex ?

Lots of couples stop sleeping together in the runup to the wedding to make it more special.<br>  <br>  But if you are worried about being closer to God, why are the two of you living together without being married in the first place? If you were really that concerned, you wouldn't be living in sin.|`|cd9108e5eefb19394649f6cb2d4535e1aa	Okay, so the Bible doesn't say anything about living together, so ?<br>  It doesn't say anything about smoking, or a lot of other things.<br>  You guys are EASILY tempted into having sex because you live together, most likely share the same bed and all that.<br>  If you seperated then it would be easier to avoid sex in your case.<br>  That's probably the only advice I can give to you at this point.<br>  yes to save money that's smart, but just think about it this way, you've already had so much sex, if you have anymore it won't be special on your wedding night.|`|mzhFrm5Taa	You have already done it so it's not going to make the difference how many more times you do it.

But whats the point now? You and him are not virgins anymore, but you do plan on marrying each other. I really don't understand why you all of a sudden dont want sex. You're going to marry the guy, and have done it numerous times. Go ahead and enjoy then!|`|7FGsxx4Qaa	Why avoid it if you are committed to each other ? God shouldn't make you feel guilty for making love with your chosen one,HE is good and wants good things for us. That is why HE created man and woman.

c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Your mom may have been too young when she left and made a terrible mistake by doing so. It'd be good of you to let it go. . . people do learn from their mistakes, and they can change. Change and learning is what life and experience is all about.    No matter what she says, you will never really understand why she left - she may not understand it herself.    That said, it's up to YOU how much or how little she is to be involved in your life. If she's too close, you must step back a little. Don't invite her in too much, and don't give her a full accounting of what you are up to. Invite her into your life when you feel like it. (You are allowed to make up excuses, too, to not hurt her feelings.)    Your mom gave up her right to like or not like the woman who stepped in and became your mother.     I think you are very lucky to now have two moms who love you. You can love them both, and still keep one of them at a little distance that makes you comfortable.    Good luck to you. You sound very mature, so someone did right by you. Kudos to your dad, too.|`|w3oVzM2Zaa	hi her just jumping back in your life & expecting e/t the same is not the way.She has to realize that.It was her choice to leave.But she obviously wants to reconnect. u cant fully reconnect if u dont have a real talk with her & about why she left.You have got to tell her how you feel bec ur going to boil over & get all mad at her instead of having a open conversation.Until you really know her & figure her out dont put your guard dowm.She might be what you expect or dont expect.I hope all will be well for you. wishing you the best of luck!|`|4CINI0fsaa	well i think you should just sit down and talk aboiut it with her and also ask her to give you a little space|`|M5oMYc9Laa	Unfortunately, you have trust issues because of abandonment.  This is not uncommon.  You have to find a way to reconcile your feelings so that you can forgive her and move on with your life.  I think the best thing you can do is to be honest with her.  Let her know that she must earn your trust but it must be on your terms.  You should also let her know that you would appreciate her not overstepping your boundaries and that she can't make up for the past in the way she wants but instead, it has to be in the way you need.  She needs to understand that you are an adult and she needs to respect that.|`|5wt0En1Zaa	I haven't experience anything like this so I might not say exactly what your looking for.  Your mum made a mistake and she's trying to move on.    She loves you as she is your child.  I know this seems hard as she hasn't seen your for years, but it takes time for your mum to sort out marriage problems.     Try to socialize with your real mum. Try to get to know her more by going out with her one day. If she over does it, tell her you need to have some space on your own or with your step-mother.    It takes time to gain someones trust back. I think your mum is really sorry about this and she wants to try and make you trust her again. Be patient as at some times, I hate my mum but then again I love her.     I hope this helped. Good luck!|`|oZpqEdI7aa	Be honest with your mother, tell her how you feel. Tell no more BS, give me an Answer, a reason, the truth. Let your emotions out.-Finally, try and work something out with her|`|Y77wbUZxaa	Talk to your mom and tell her why you don't really believe her...Let her know that she hasn't been in your life for most of the time so she shouldn't expect to just come in and have you completely trust her...|`|qfnguIStaa	I've never been through anything like that, but if I were in your place, I would give her another chance. I mean, get to know her and stuff. It probably isn't easy, but maybe she did change and she regrets that she ever left you in the first place. By that I'm not meaning you should totally let her back in your life and you can still get along with your stepmom, even if your real mom doesn't like that. Just be nice, later on you'll figure out if she really changed and if she's trying really hard to make up for the mistake she once made by leaving you or not.     (:|`|0bYcYz2jaa	You shouldn't feel bad about getting along with your step-mom better than your biological mother.  She wasn't there to build a relationship with you so it's unreasonable of her to expect there to be one all of a sudden.  Telling her so will hurt her feelings, but she is a grown woman.  She has NO right to expect you to just welcome her with open arms.  Every relationship takes time to build and you only need to build it if you want to.  If she really has changed and wants to get to know you, then she better get used to the idea of doing it at your pace and on your schedule.|`|u9uFdSrqaa	Since you are 18 if you don't want to you don't have to let her back in your life.Tell her that you are still upset about her leaving and you still wonder why. You could put forth an effort to get along wit her but just make sure you always have your guard up
OxnFnyqPaa	Oh my GOD! <br>  Are you kidding me?<br>  That is like sooo sweet and of course your girl is reacting the way she does right now because she's a bit shy.<br>  I do that sometimes, my significant other calls me beautiful, pretty, and sexy all the time! Even on the phone and through SMS! <br>  It was a bit embarrassing at first in my case as I was not used to being called like that, but after wards I got used to it and now I'm okay with it.<br>  He said he wouldn't say things like that if he didn't mean it or if it isn't true.<br>  So there you go...<br>  <br>  Keep making her feel special, it's good and girls love it! <br>  And complimenting someone doesn't make you beneath them.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|AA11441704	No, it is okay.|`|eAarsjjMaa	If you say it too often it can get tedious, but when you just compliment her every so often it's normally seen as a good thing.<br>  I mean, if someone complimented me like that, my reaction would be "nooooo" or something that slightly rejects the compliment, because if I said "thanks" it would sound abit full of myself.|`|QU37MZi7aa	it's nice but it depends also on how you sounded those words toward her. sometimes it could be accounted as just words expressed by the mouth if not saying it heartily. just like saying always "i love you" but deep inside it wasn't meant for you. lol.|`|NwMUaHYzaa	wtf? i want to go like stab that man for making guys stop calling us beautiful.<br>  <br>  its really nice. though it does get a little irritating if they say it all the time. :)|`|3BMBZtDxaa	Don't listen to the radio!<br>  <br>  Me and some girl friends were talking about this the other day. We all LOVE it when guys tell us we're beautiful. We hate it when they say you're sexy or hot, but when you get a beautiful every now and again during special moments like on a date or just to lift up your date, it's sweet!<br>  <br>  Don't say it too often because then it looses it's meaning. But if you say it every so often and save it for special moments, then it's amazing!<br>  <br>  And you should tell her you truly mean it. That will make her smile =]<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	It is wonderful that you compliment your girl so readily and I'm sure she appreciates it.  It's so important in a relationship to keep this kind of thing up.  If partners object it is usually because they are insecure about themselves or their relationships or that the compliment is obviously untrue.  In a loving relationship it bolsters confidence, security and self esteem.|`|XakZ3N1xaa	Absolutely nothing wrong with telling her that shes beautiful. If you don't she might find someone else to. Just my opinion though, I love being treated like a princess and its not hard to find someone else to if my significant other won't. Sorry, those guys are full of sh*t and prob unhappily married or single.|`|wE2etBzbaa	Don't listen to radio crap talk shows.  they all sucks<br>  <br>  <br>  It is good to call women beautiful especially your girl,  but just don't overdo it, don't say it everyday, because she will get used to it and won't feel unique and nice|`|YjUztskvaa	I wouldn't mind.

Don't take serious advice from those ridiculous shows meant only to entertain superficial meatheads.<br>  <br>  Second, the statement was derived from some distorted truth. You don't want to come across as totally available or clingy, especially during the first few months. It can get repetitive... and most people love a challenge, romantically. There's a chance some girls might get bored if you dote on them incessantly. It can get a little tired.<br>  <br>  Last, you should not try to "drag" a girl down. Never try to lower someone else's self esteem. For God's sake... that's absolutely immoral and selfish. If you love a person you want them to be happy, not wondering if they're attractive or not. Compliment your girl, by all means... especially if you mean it and you love her and want to make her happy. Just don't stumble over yourself to become a doormat for her.|`|80aDsO21aa	I prefer a guy to call me beautiful instead of hot, sexy, cute or anything like that. Not only that whenever a guy calls me beautiful I deny it because I disagree, it isn't out of trying to get a compliment or attention, and most girls do do it because they don't believe it but there also those attention whores, so yeah.|`|4USvZW6vaa	i don't think that there is anything wrong with saying that to a woman.. but the thing is that you cant keep saying that every time or to cover up something that u've done.. it looses its real meaning.. its actually a pleasant thing to hear once in a while.. i think that not all people the same but if u feel that its bugging her they just simply stop..|`|zvvzcLdIaa	some women don't like to admit it even if they are, don't put her on the spot, tell her not to take it as a joke and she'll really respect the comment,<br>  <br>  alot of guys say it just to get a girl in their pants, its kinda turned into a derogetry term|`|KPm8LM8Maa	women are supposed to like it. my gf does a lot.|`|K0549f2Caa	Don't call women beautiful unless she is your girl or wife because that just sounds cocky to the ladies.<br>  <br>  You tell a woman she is beautiful it will mess her up and get to her head, then she will think less of you. It's just simple you can do it here and there in certain occasions, but don't over do it because she will start thinking you adore her and it just screws things up. <br>  <br>  The best time to do it is if she is pregnant because she needs the support and could be feeling fat, but other than that don't make a habit of it.<br>  <br>  You can also tell her if u give her a gift such as a dress, or jewelry, but in that case you can because you gave her something and that opens a door where u can make the comment.
TKcTAVI5aa	yeah it means something!<br>  <br>  girls who ARE NOT into guys (who are nice anyway) don't look at them so they don't encourage them. if this had happened once or twice, i wouldn't be as sure. but she definatly is intrested, make a move! talk to her casually though, don't come on too strong though, that is kind of a turn off.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	Yes it certainly does mean something.  She fancies you and I guess the feeling is reciprocated but you are just finding it hard to take it any further.  Next time your eyes meet, smile.  And the time after that laugh and stop to talk about it.  You will be surprised where a friendly approach can get you.|`|jtW0DVMWaa	:(|`|tDa09Cvdaa	lulz|`|4USvZW6vaa	..FLIRT.. or try to be at least!!!|`|BgYP1h98aa	yes really to have a good contact into their heart
LAXbJfvwaa	I think it sounds like great fun - you don't want to pressure your guests into dancing if they don't want to - but if you think there will be some that would enjoy learning some new steps then I think it would be fun!  You will do well talking to your instructor to see what they suggest - but I think something like a progressive fox trot would be easy enough for them to learn.  If you want something more upbeat then a progressive jive would be great fun.    I definately love the traditional waltz - make sure you and your fiance have enough time to learn it well - it is reasonably easy but you don't want to be thinking about HOW to dance on your actual wedding night - you want it to be second nature so you can enjoy the dance!    (Just in case you didn't know - A progressive dance is where you stand in a circle and swap partners - they are usually easy dances because of this and people tend to have more fun cause they get to mingle while they dance!)|`|Ydl1B5OMaa	I think your idea is unique, but people usually go to weddings to show their love and support for the bride and groom and to have a good and relaxing time....not to feel pressured into taking dance lessons. I know you're looking at your wedding as "your day" (and you should to some extent) but you should also be thinking about your guests. I'm not saying that you're going to demand that every guest participate (at least I would hope not) but I know I would feel pressured if I was at a wedding where the bride and groom hired a dance instructor to teach dances. You might want to rethink this choice.|`|h6b4kNm4aa	the waltz classic and pretty as well as stunning to look at.
aaCMNSB2aa	OMG! I just had a flash back! The same thing happen to me except he was weirder because he would tell me he loves me, then wants to just be friends, then want to marry me, then flirts with other girls. He had lots of friends that were girls too! Arug! Don't you just hate them!?<br>  <br>  Ok, so it turned out I talked to him about it calmly and told him what he dose to make it seem like he's flirting. He said he had no Idea that was just his personality. I later learn that was the truth and his sister is the same way. He was so impressed with the way I confronted him about it he went to our pastor to ask if we could take some marriage classes with him. Apparently he had a lot of girls make a big deal out of it and dump him without explanation... which isn't a very responsible relationship by the way. You should always talk things out with him first.<br>  <br>  Just keep in mind, I did marry that guy he ended up being a cheater and we got divorce... Is it because he's a flirt? -I can't be sure even today.<br>  <br>  --Good Luck, CutieNiki|`|Kpw1Uaqmaa	DUMP HIM NOW...VERY DISRESPECTFUL|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	yes, looks like he doesn't appreciate you at all and it seems he's not even serious with you. dump him. you deserves better.|`|MtsfAnXVaa	hurry dumb him, before he hits that sh!t|`|1b9b2144f2dfcbf2ab89c159c0722b98aa	Seems like you've been bitter and jealous this whole time. What you see as flirting is probably just talking to a friend. Have you told him you love him or like him recently or any compliment?|`|iiMQhey6aa	drop him - -|`|a1HF7WNeaa	dump him now you don't need him hun !!!!!!!!!!!!|`|a162de189aa1c1becbdbb0cd4b7cd67caa	do it now sweetie.<br>  <br>  he doesn't deserve you!|`|lUrJDOBOaa	You need to DUMP HIM NOW!!!!!!!! You deserve so much better than what he is NOT giving. You are smart, beautiful and strong and if he cannot see that some other guy will. He has the audacity to flirt with other girls around you? Come on girl!!!???? You are so much more than that kinda crap. You will find a guy who will chase after you, who will love you and tell you that you are the only one for him. As for now love yourself take time to develop yourself and show him that you can still be fabulous without him. You are a jewel and he is so stupid not to see how special you are. Don't settle for less because you deserve the best and the best will come my dear in good time. If he wants your best friend and ex best friend well then to hell with him. Believe me I've been through it and now i have a guy who treats me like a queen. You deserve that too.<br>  Good luck my dear and be strong ok.|`|OeQbs95Naa	aww you are too good to be a doormat. He may be using you and i say you have a realy good reason to dump him. Find some one more mature|`|JvbvGtrBaa	doodes a prick get over him u can get a man that treats you the way you pictured a healhty relationship <br>  keep the dream alive<br>  and don't throw youself at him anymore he'll prolly come back to you when you don't care but be strong get over him he doens't treat u right

Or, even better, have ex-boyfriends pay you to do this for their ex-girlfriends; they'll be so fed up and disgusted that they'll come running back to their old beaus.

dCMi5rjdaa	Good Morning Nic..,<br>  yes, we all say the best thing to do is go and ask your partner..<br>  <br>  there are just SOOOOO many signs. sometimes it isn't a whole pile of things,<br>  <br>  sometimes it could be just one thing that's different. (then maybe it is just something wrong at home) and not fooling around.<br>  <br>  and sometimes it's asked here, cuz some of us have been f.........ucked around and know some of the signs and can maybe help a little that way with 'investigation'|`|3b81d471c44135bcc3043a49eca775e2aa	no.. i don't believe in those good-for-nothing.. believing in and moving on stuff...<br>  if u think ur partner cheats on u.. then find out in any way u think necessay.... with whom or when or how.... if u r wrong.. tell her/him sorry and love her/him like u can never love again coz u insulted his/her innocence<br>  but if u r right.. find wise and effective way to get rid of that ********* or d.e.v.i.l and find urself someone better..|`|8n3NvYQwaa	you got it girl,,,  investigation...   hey when your mate starts to act different to you and not treating you like you are the only thing alive...   they are cheating...   hey I was a rounder when I was young and I went with girls and when I got tired I still stayed with them and cheated...  men do that.....   Grant M|`|AA10373401	Maybe instead of asking someone, you should ask what you did that may have caused the person to cheat.  Most people cheat because of something they lack in their relationship.  so before you go complaining, look within yourself first.|`|Zca1PGERaa	if you just come out and ask that then of course youl get a reply of "what?? eh no no no no im not...then the You dont trust me... then the your a bad person snooping about me not trusting me.....<br>  <br>  best to sit back keep mouth zipped and wait|`|zka26204aa	Of course he will.  You need to do some investigating before you confront him.  Be sure that you know what is going on.|`|6URBv5xfaa	i also wonder the same.....i feel asking is of no use, rather find out and then ask and then move on|`|dca2c702f1f138a553055a97f5b22bd4aa	If you feel like you have to ask this question, it is time to move on!|`|AA10494978	We all want to trust our partner completely.  But sometimes we just get a weird feeling that something is going on that is not appropriate.  There are clues which give him/her away and its different for men and women.  Men tend to get really "gifty", meaning they all of a sudden become romantics and want to give gifts to their partners, whereas women tend to become more happy and relaxed - there is a reason for that.  An affair typicall is not about the sex.  Its about an emotional connection with someone outside the marriage.  Sex is only a by product.  The affair started long before intercourse.  So, trusting your partner is great.  But when something feels wrong, usually it is.|`|AA11814313	Ok let me answer this it's body language...ask somebody if they r cheating and if you know them you can tell by the look on their face.|`|lsU6Ph7Yaa	It's your partner, there's no clear answer as everyone is different.|`|831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	This is a hard question and I believe, through personal experiences, once they think the Cat is out of the bag, so to speak, they know the game is up and are somewhat relieved to see their partner not yelling and screaming and, are willing to talk about it. If not, then they're really deep into something.<br>         I found out this way, asking questions from her co-workers and getting some answers that were partly true. When she knew I had a good idea what was happening, she confessed that she was terribly sorry but, how long would of it lasted, ? I don't know.|`|a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	the cheater will usually lie unless he is really ready to move on. its best to keep silent, and follow him, this way he won't suspect anything. always follow your intuition, it won't tell u exactly whats going on but it will alert u that something isn't right.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Personally I agree that if just suspect someone is cheating you'll probably just get lies if you ask him about it. You need to KNOW the person is cheating and  approach with the statement I know you are cheating with XXX and let him go from there. He may try to lie his way out of it at first but if you are absolutely sure just keep telling him you already know it's a fact that he's cheating, ask why he did out, unless he outright asks you for a divorce you could try marriage counseling or just leave. The most important thing is to know for sure before you bring it up to him.|`|ghz5D5iLaa	You can usually tell by their reaction and what they say if you believe them or not. If you are suspicious there is a reason and you need to look into it. There are a lot of signs that get over looked.|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Course they will deny it! But you need proof to be able to know if they are lying or not! Then confront them and see, You can normally tell when people are lying anyway!|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Ooh I never answer that.  If they think they are cheating there are pretty clear signs and the person actually does know already but is refusing to come to terms with it.<br>  <br>  My advice - move on.
f610fce787e6299e681ff222a3173ed5aa	Oh come on, "I'm too busy for the next 10 years to have a relationship"??  Either he's a commitment phobe or he's trying to get rid of you.  If you go to the same med school I fail to see the problem, I mean when you're exhausted you fall asleep together, you support each other emotionally re the tough studies & you help each other study for tests, etc, just like all those people on Greys Anatomy where you see them quizzing each other to help study for tests, etc.  Work isn't everything, if this guy claims to be devoting himself to his studies & career for 10 years with nothing else in it then frankly I think you should find someone else as that doesn't sound like much of a life.|`|OHfZFR31aa	If you are the same school it's obviously easier. Otherwise it's as difficult as any other long distance relationship. It takes 120% committment from both parties to make it work, otherwise it won't last|`|D2g0XSLTaa	No.  If you are really serious about each other you will wait and finish your schooling.  Do not mess it up with getting married before or even moving in together.<br>  <br>  Med school is 24/7.     No time for anything else.  The competition is strenuous.  Not enough time in the dayl  Exhaustion.  When you finally do get to sleep, it is not enough.  <br>  Finish school.

My girlfriend keeps trying to pay for things and I keep winning...muahaha<br>  <br>  In this day and age it's very difficult - some girls get upset because they think the guy is being sexist or condescending so it takes a bit of understanding each other and discussing these things to make sure neither is feeling awkward or hurt.<br>  <br>  But yes, the boyfriend should in my opinion.|`|qVNSMkYlaa	if they can't work that out between them there is NO hope for the future|`|znvx2NMQaa	well maybe not everything but most things<br>  <br>  i mean if a girl is on holidays abd decides she wants to buy this hiddeous dress the bf shouldent be expected to pay for stuff like that.<br>  <br>  but meals and accomodation yes.
oDTzW46maa	Honestly, most girls are simply going to like what you get them, no matter how cheap it is. I personally like something that came from the heart and took time to put together. It's quite sweet to do that.But, if you want to buy her something. Try a little necklace or bracelet, maybe a cute stuffed animal. I always enjoy getting a cute little stuffed animal.    And, to ask her out- Well, I understand that can be quite awkward. But, you both like each other. So, maybe on Valentines Day you should ask her out. From a guy she likes that would be a great present!|`|Wo6K4vPraa	candy|`|Uj5kuzoJaa	Honestly you can't go wrong with roses (or a chocolate rose) and a stuffed animal. But the cool thing to do is to try to find what interests her. Like if she's been talking about a particular band lately get her their cd, or even meet up with her at the mall and see what she points out that she really likes. But seriously when i was 13-14 years old i was excited to get anything for Valentines day. Box of chocolates, anything. And I would ask her out on valentines day. Give her the stuff you bought and at the same time ask her if she will be your girl. You seem to already know that she likes you now you just need the courage to go through with it. If you ask her out on Valentines day you're also killing two birds with one stone because then your aniversary will be on V-day and you will only have to celebrate once. good luck!!!!|`|UJZPNHpFaa	Just stay simple. You guys aren't even dating yet. She's probably not expecting anything from you. Just get her something to show you're thinking about her like the traditional flowers and candy. I'm sure she'll love it. Get her a card too and maybe you can ask her out in the card if you're scared to in person.|`|mS2ZFHpYaa	buy a teddy bear which is holding a love heart and a red rose :) this should be romantic     Good luck xxx|`|bcZo6CUGaa	Get her a cute little stuff animals.

I can tell from a distance if a guy is cute or not!<br>  <br>  I say it's wrong because it leads them on.|`|SzznKScoaa	No, because if you are not impressed at first, you really will not be at last...|`|LguXFbvsaa	Why would it be wrong? You have to be attracted to someone to like them, to want to date them... though, you shouldn't ONLY want to meet attractive women. That would leave you pretty ignorant and boring and shallow. Be sensitive toward other people's feelings. I'm sure you've been shunned before just for your physical characteristics. Just don't make it obvious when you're being superficial.|`|YjUztskvaa	yeah it happens to every body!|`|1keW9Dofaa	We do it all the time.

831e735ba92bb0dfd3b16be0d4995ccfaa	I don't think age here matters, your both mature adults. I would guess your both working and have time with your job and life to decide what you want to do. <br>       You could hint around to see what he wants to do with his life but, I wouldn't push him, you might just push him out the door.<br>  <br>        If your sleeping with him, playing house with him, then he's got what he wants.<br>  <br>         In question: My friend is fifty three years old, never been married, has three steady girl friends. He states, why get married, I have everything I want and they go home when they get tired enough of it. Then another comes over, they all know about each other and are competing but, they don't know there's never going to be that special day.<br>  <br>  <br>           So, you take it from there Hon.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	There's plenty of ways to ask without being pushy.......where do you see this relationship going, what are your thoughts on marriage in general, do you ever think about having children some day. I certainly wouldn't give him an ultimatum when you don't even know how he feels  about marriage.  I found it disturbing that you've been together for 9 months and you're afraid to ask him such an important or why the question has not been discussed by now. If what you want is marriage and he doesn't wouldn't you want to know now before you get any further in this relationship? Why would you want to waste your time with someone who doesn't share your life goals?|`|LS8LcuRaaa	You'll know when he is ready, when he asks the question. You've only known each other for 9 months and he's only 26!! You're asking too much too soon. If you pressure him or give him an ultimatum I doubt there will be any wedding at all. You don't need a piece of paper to say you are in a relationship. Just enjoy the time together and don't rush into marriage. When he's ready he will ask. Remember, marriage is a big and scary step for a guy.|`|psLk5fDGaa	I wouldn't give him an ultimatum, that's coming on a bit strong. However, I would hint at a proposal. Casually bring up a ring style you like, or say who you want to design your wedding dress. Subtle hints do it best. <br>  <br>  If he doesn't get the hint then back off a bit and give it a while. But don't wait around forever. If another year rolls by then lay down the line for him.|`|86ae6c095ead6eac412d00ff8b1bd24caa	9 months is very short.  Don't push this man away with unnecessary pressure.  Your relationship seems to good to spoil and your biological clock still has a way to run.|`|blirKov3aa	6 years apart?cool,marry him,|`|ghvU8CsOaa	I think its just you and your guy who can answer this. Ultimatum gives them a wide-eye confusion. Why would you? He's 26, right? What are his priorities. You should be in-sync with each other regarding this. Because if not, it will only lead to splitsville.<br>  <br>  Marriage is something that want to think a hundred times over. Divorce should never be an option. Enjoy his company, he will tell you when he's ready. 32 is not old. :)|`|rtMmV1Wfaa	I'm thinking its way too soon to consider that. If he does love you, there is no need for you to rush into marriage with him since he will eventually ask you himself. From personal experiences and knowledge; the 9 months is not enough time to settle this. It should be at least 3 years, where you'll know that he is ready to be committed to you. However; i cant judge you guys' relationship, but this is the tips i have for you while considering many of the facts on relationships. Hope this helped.|`|MFRO3pE1aa	You will seem pushy. A woman brought this up to me after we dated for just 4 months and I was like, whoa!<br>  <br>  What is marriage anyway? It's what should be a life-long committment to be with each other exclusively. To me, it means you're both ready to start a family. Is that what you both want? Maybe you're letting yourself be driven by your age and comparison of others around you.<br>  <br>  I'm certain that you could convince him that marriage is the right thing, but he might regret it later and feel like he was tricked into it. Someone has to bring it up sometime, though. If you've already discussed it, lay off. He knows it's out there.|`|sXTjYH7Iaa	Give him an ultimatum and you'd better be prepared for both sides to eventuate - he may opt out. Be very careful with that.  Talk, talk, talk. Sometimes men don't talk so try to find a time when he will. Ask him if he wants to get married.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Communication is what you need, not an ultimatum -they're dangerous.|`|fZgwb1rqaa	Why don't you just ask him? If you think it's a little too early than it probably is :)<br>  <br>  Give it time, I bet the answer will come out of him... <br>  <br>  I wouldn't give him an ultimatum though! It never has positive results on relationships.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	Age is just a number, but if this guy really loves you he will ask you to marry him.  Do not give him an ultimatum you will scare him away, please give him time to think over.|`|c32aCqwqaa	if you are close enough you can ask those question without being scared of what your partner may think
TKcTAVI5aa	UGH. i really want to say average looking nice guy.<br>  <br>  but i always end up faling for the good looking guy who doesn't have the best personality, its not because im shallow. its mainly because when a good looking guy flirts my instincts tell me to flirt back sinces he's hot. its all about first impressions, you usually don't know the average looking guy is nice. :[|`|820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	Personality is more important than looks, especially if you want a future with them (i.e. marriage), but there needs to be some attraction there physically, even if it's not fireworks every time you see them. If there's no personality the relationship will tire really quickly, running out of conversation is not very nice.|`|JDQ3dJPkaa	the average-looking guy, for sure! you have to live with that personality!!<br>  <br>  and also, at your 20th high school reunion, the good looker has a long way to fall, because he's likely just gonna be average looking later on in life...will lose the hair, will pick up weight, will turn from the hot jock to the used car dealer, okay??<br>  <br>  and sometimes the average joe guy will end up better looking and in better financial shape than the hunky one, just because he will often be more focused from an earlier age. <br>  <br>  just what i've noticed, even as i approach my 20th high school reunion!!|`|mndLFdnFaa	obvious<br>  an average looker with a good personality.|`|1xDo1PWBaa	Average but nice guy, Looks change but the person stays the same.<br>  (:|`|YhlA2HoPaa	a guy that makes you happy<br>  THATS ALL THAT MATTERS|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Average nice guy.|`|nQix64Puaa	well it's more about which one suits me the best, but mostly i think it will go with the first choice becuz for one of the reasons, appearance wil always change as time goes by but personality prob wont :)|`|PVb3iiaAaa	a nice guy.... as my friends can tell i dont date people 4 there looks.... <br>  example a) Michael Koshley... look him up on myspace|`|VcIg1R1zaa	1st one def.even if the first option didn't exist,i wouldn't choose the other one.|`|DW5Eqc8vaa	a good looking guy who hasn't got the best personality|`|1jIzBUkhaa	I like a guy, that has a good heart, romantic,special Looks don't mean nothing , Love is from the heart.
Jf5h5OPCaa	Okay trust me.. if he is cheating on you and you are only 14 years old, get out now. At that age, you don't need to go through a mishap, and honey trust me this will never turn out good. If you want a stable faithful relationship, you have to know from the beginning that he would never cheat on you.|`|XGZBEdAWaa	You know at 14 you both have at least several more relationships ahead of you.<br>  All you can do is talk to him and tell him how you feel, be honest though.<br>  As far as getting people to mind their own business goes, good luck. As long as YOUR business is more interesting than THEIR business there will always be someone poking their nose in your business.<br>  You could always try sex to keep him interested, nothing interests guys more than sex, but your probably to young for that.  Before you give up the goods, make sure that he's worth it. Good luck, lol.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	What people get involved? <br>  <br>  Other girls -then they are jealous and want you to break up. <br>  <br>  You have never cheated, but has he (as you want him to stay faithful)?<br>  <br>  If he has cheated - get rid of him. You cannot trust him if he is a cheat.<br>  Especially if he does this so early.|`|CrZxYK5raa	talk to him....<br>  that's all you can do. <br>  trust each other. tell him how <br>  you feel and your sorry for cheating on him! :)|`|8Loq9Skraa	Those people are only jealous!

She can place an add on criagslist.  That way she can bring in some money, stay at home and stay with her kid.  2. Really talk with her about what she would like to do.  3. Help her edit her resume and do mock interviews.  4. Help her focus her search in the directions she wants to look in.  5. Look for part time or "to make it through" jobs while she's looking for other positions.|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	First - how long ago has this happened (her being laid off).  It can take a while to get out of the sad mood.    Second - ask her what kind of work she would like, and then ask if you can help her look. Ask your contacts etc.   Put word out to friends, that she looks for a job.    Also, you should really talk together. Explain that you are getting frustrated with the lack of success she seems to be having.    Ideas? If she is good with kids , why not do daycare work.  She can take her kid with her, and get paid to watch over him (and others)    Maybe there is some work from home she could do?    The possibilities are currently somewhat limited, due to the financial crisis the media and the government are putting us in - so please also realize that.     On the other hand, having your mother or father at home when you are a schoolkid, is really a luxury. It helps you become a stable adult as well.     Just my $0.02|`|AA12085256	Unfortunately, the only advice to give you just may be the only sound advice to give you, yet you don't want to hear it.  Imagine if she was your wife....  Maybe this woman just doesn't have the work ethics you are looking for.  If she is indeed really, truly trying, you just have to give her time....  The economy is tight right now.  Keep passing along leads to her...it just may help her find a position.|`|8KWuDE2Gaa	Childcare.  See if she can keep some kids.  That might be $75 a day, per child.|`|PvsXr9E6aa	Sign her up for a paper route or take her job hunting on your days off so you know she actually is applying for work!|`|LsHkgexvaa	Face it...You are being bitchy. Finding a job in today's economy is difficult. People are being laid off by the 10,000's. Even the McDonalds jobs are drying up. She should apply for unemployment and maybe food stamps to reduce the stress on your finances until she can obtain employment. Finally, Putting expectations on other people is a premeditated resentment. If you continue feeling this way you will be looking for a new girlfriend.
D2vVMbdlaa	maybe she starts to be a new person, but your story hurts, and now she's being jealous, well if I were you I would explain everything to her, and if she gets mad try to fix it, don't give up yet, you've got plenty of time. also Conquer her with love even she acts messy on your relationship. I'm not saying that she is bad and I can't tell if she's a good person or not, because don't under estimate on others and I even don't know her. Find a way that will remain strong on your friendship. Find something good that makes sure that you and your "best friend" will be your best friend again, well forever.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!
6GsBnaNyaa	hmmm, well, i know that i've been down this road before a time or two. i think that if he liked you for that long, chances are, he's probably not COMPLETELY over you. so, maybe you should talk to him about it. maybe over text? because sometimes it's easier that way. tell him that you kinda realized that you do have feelings for him & you made a mistake by not answering him soon enough last time when he told you how he felt about you. say that you'd really like to see if anything could happen, but if he doesnt feel the same way, then you completely understand & still would love to be good friends. i know it's easier said than done, but if there are other girls after him too, maybe its best to let him know how you feel before its REALLY too late. you know? & i bet your friend is right. you probably are flirting with eachother. maybe you just dont realize it. i hope i've helped! let me know what you think! (:|`|sLUiQ6Txaa	yeh i agree with the two above, just go for it youve got nothing to lose. he obviously likes ou enough as a friend so it cant go that tragically =)|`|v0GwTTsVaa	ask him out.  the worst he could do is say no.  you could even make it a casual thing......instead of labeling it a date and then go from there.|`|WNPGVpQWaa	What's your question hun?

Maybe you will regret it but you will never know unless you say somthing. I really liked this guy but I was too afraid to tell him how I felt and he got with a different girl.

Two, take a walk with her, but MAKE SURE YOU PASS BY SOMEWHERE THAT HAS SOME FLOWERS GROWING... Simply walk with her and pick up the flowers and give them to her and give her a kiss and a compliment about her... Spend your time talking about things... and if you can, try to cook up some dinner for her.. Its the thought that counts man... Be caring and show that you lover her...

W1xs3vYBaa	Both of you should be clear with your intent with the relationship, your morals and ethics. What you can find compromise with and what you will not compromise on. This should happen early on to avoid confusion. Even if they appear to be Mr. Right he isn't unless you can find solid moral ground together. <br>  <br>  This means you need to understand what you want out of a relationship and what you want for yourself.|`|NhPSz1kHaa	A guy told me he couldn't marry me and keep his mother happy so I ended it that day.|`|e80aa9c0a25afc548ff200fc3f1000dfaa	There is no single answer to this question.

What if he/she cheated and thought you won't find out and also lied and defended against it.   <br>  <br>  What if he/she said disrespectful things about you in front of others.    What if he/she puts you down most of the time?   How about discrediting you most of the time. <br>  <br>  So these can go on.  It all depends on what you can forgive and what you cannot and what really bothers you over and over and you cannot get over.  <br>  <br>  So if you guys cannot talk it out, and even if you talk the same things happen over and over again, then try counselling.

CQPvngCeaa	Hmm. Do u mean ---<br>  <br>  "I know that I dumped some people, but since I have already said that i was sorry, why do they still want to ruin my life? I know I have hurt them, and everything is over. But why do i still feel" .... Is that afraid or what? Or is it offended? .... "by a few of them, especially those 2 whom I have dumped?

Good luck with those girls / boys!
UcezPQcjaa	u got it right, hes just unhappy.<br>  dont deal with it|`|6DGLxJ1daa	I'd say you have the right understanding of this situation.  I'm sure not just guys think we'll always be waiting, but both men and women have capacity to be self-centered in this regard.|`|ck49dTH7aa	Glad you are putting the past behind you and moving on to your future with your now fiance. A lot happens in 5 years, and you would also have to deal with his family who sound very strict.  Guys just think you are there for them when they hurt.
2KJvaWDYaa	i know EXACTLY what ur saying. what i did was just slowly let the relationship pitter away. see her less, talk to her less, spend more time with other friends. basically she is a terrible friend who is insecure and is scared of people not liking her, so she makes u do her dirty work. <br>  drop her!|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Next time she complains remind her that she is an adult and it is her responsibility to stand up for herself and if she is not going to stand up for herself, then to shut up because you are not into whining.<br>  This will make her mad, but she needs to hear it.It is one thing to step in when someone is being mistreated,even if it hurts some one's feelings, it is another thing to continue to do this for an adult who should be doing it themselves.|`|s8cZsSX0aa	Ahhh yes the people who play Victim. Best thing is to tell them off, right while they are in the middle of telling their next victim story. Get even more points for doing it in front of other people who realize the same thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Seriously get these people out of your life, They are not worth your breath to talk to them.|`|zzGNsjUOaa	I was always bullied in my school. One boy turned the whole class against me. I just told my parents and they sorted it out but the best thing to do is go and apologise to the guy you yelled at. That might settle it a bit.|`|6efe5cc412f6f5dadb4cb03604f6ea0caa	about your friend... he seems like someone who is insecure of his friends...  he's like a person who wants all the attention focused only on him, maybe that's why he's so dramatic... we never know, he may be plastic to everyone. <br>  <br>  maybe it's best if you stay friends, just not 'close' friends.|`|2DPJobuMaa	ignore her.... i mean why be friends with someone you can't trust... just talk to her occasionally,but don't get too close to her... she might backstab you again....but i guess the only way she'll change....is if you talk to her.. tell her how you feel.|`|AA10223196	Sounds like she's got a victim complex.  She will never be satisfied so put her behind you and move on to others more positive.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	You will find this happens through out life.<br>  <br>  Some people are much better than others.  They are drama queens.  They do not know how to function in a world of harmony and bliss.  <br>  <br>  You better believe she is doing it to you.  Get away from her.  Stay away from her.  She is the quicksand in your social life.  She will take you down.

s8cZsSX0aa	He's not really a friend. Ignore him, and delete him from every digital device you have. Block his phone number, and act like you don't even see him should he pass by.

c43c4f873b96d5b8ae08c90457ffed18aa	Since this is the first time, consider it a communication problem, and forget whose fault it might be.    Instead, as the mom, you should confirm with her to be sure that it does not happen again.  If it does - then you have a problem.    Take care.|`|AA10199189	ask her nicely why it happened and remind her, if she will be late, to call his school.  at this point i wouldn't even get into anything else. you are thinking too hard about this
qZPZ2bTpaa	You go around them, in the sense that you get as far to the left or right of them as you can.  Then, if they call your name smile, wave, and keep walking.  Try to seem as friendly and polite as possible.  If that doesn't work, tell them politely that you are in a hurry.|`|tM0qJY4aaa	Maybe dont walk up to them. If you have to go past them then look the other direction and walk fast almost running but do not make eye contact. lol|`|SaMkcTGyaa	first you check me out on youtube. search jmcm25308  then you just pretend you didn't hear them. or say, srry, im kindda in a hurry, i'll talk to you later. or say something quick and just walk away.   dont forget to check me out on youtube. search jmcm25308|`|SDiNKp8oaa	"I'd love to stay and chat, but I gotta run.."?|`|rLqo6ACkaa	if you didnt want to be rude you should just say sorry im in a hurry to meet someone but i will talk later bye    if you were rude you would sayy shut up old lady i dont wanna talk lol  but never do that to anyone|`|5K1WNuNJaa	Walk slower?!? Or you could just be polite and say your in a hurry and run off. This is a obvious and weird question.|`|j0pnaVChaa	Be polite, acknowledge them by saying good morning ,afternoon, etc. and keep walking.|`|izbAdDUraa	golly. you are kind of rude! slow down and enjoy life.. spending a moment talking to someone won't kill you.|`|dDDAbqqhaa	no...if I see someone and don't want to talk to them, I make sure they see me and notice I don't talk to them, so they don't bother next time :)|`|htMOl3c4aa	Just say, "sorry, I'm in a hurry" and walk on.|`|E3ue1nWAaa	Just say this, "Oh, hi Mrs. Smith! I'm in a bit of a hurry, but it was nice talking to you! Bye!" Works every time.|`|SIFwDinAaa	just be polite and say "yea thats good," or watever, and say "well, listen i got to go, but it was nice seeing/talking to you again. bye"  hope this helps :)|`|8552a4e84a403e597110d3e39aa0659eaa	Just say "I'm sorry, can't stop, in a hurry. Bye!"|`|ne8mBivvaa	Just explain to her that you would love to talk to her but you are in a rush at the moment.  Maybe you will see each other soon.  This way you aren't rude.|`|RIhfYG0Saa	OMG that's hard, I'm not sure but hope you find out!|`|XJGp4AxHaa	I usually just walk as far to one side as I can and look away. If they catch you though then turn and face. Then say that you are sorry but that you are in a really big hurry and that you have to go.
kW371HVMaa	steal him from the other girl then he will see how much better u are and break up with his gf and ask u out. flirt a little with him and if you can (i know this is really cheesy but it works) pretend to talk to someone in the halls and when hes coming the other way act like u were to busy talking and bump in to him and drop ur books (i know this is what happens in the movies but it works it worked with me and my new bf ;]) u  guys will be picking up ur books and be like sorry im such a clutz! ( guys like it when ur helpless then they can "save" u) then u will flirt a lil and give him the idea that u like him. also if u have green or blue eyes it would be great cuz then he will probley compliment how pretty ur eyes are|`|aDPOn62Yaa	Thers a lot of fish in the sea and frankly, this ones taken.|`|0fVtHNtmaa	Wait till he breaks it off. It's the right thing to do.|`|7tLDdtqGaa	get fat. make sure you're fatter than his current girlfriend. i would go for whoever's fatter.|`|12xQlgr7aa	It may be hard, but the truth is that if you take him from this girl you'll be breaking her heart. This is a time when you gotta look away from yahoo answers and ask your own morals and compare it to how much you want him. Make sure it means alot to you before you take him from someone else.
Euj25fcXaa	Best.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	It's horrible to break up by text or messaging  if you've been going on for a lot longer than 10 days.<br>  I'd say go ahead and break it off by messaging, just be sincere and polite.|`|XFxEfHYzaa	If messaging is your most common form of communication with him - then yes, it would be ok. Just do it kindly and respectfully.<br>  <br>  If things are really awkward between both of you, then he may be relieved and probably thinking of doing the same too.|`|lXBVrik7aa	If you can see him in person soon, I would say it's wrong, while I don't quite get why it's thought of as wrong, the fact that it is supposedly wrong makes it seem worse to me. But that's just me. But don't say anything too insensitive, if you do it my message, be as kind as you possibly can to make it seem a bit better. Hope it helped and good luck!|`|Mqee6u8jaa	no it's never  really good to break up through any kind of messaging. if your going to break up With someone it should always be in person. out of respect to them and for yourself. you don't want to be known for ending it with a text or a myspace message.|`|ZvUsQIAXaa	its not wronq. . but its kinda bad but then aqain good to avoid all the wierdness and all of that . .  just be kind and tell him you feel like u rushed into somethinq you weren't sure of.<br>  <br>  (:
mE48VMXiaa	Well, you should respect his privacy unless you had reasonable cause, so I'm assuming you were suspicious about something... but if it's just a little porn sight he visited, then be relieved because you could have come across much worse dirt; and you probably should have let something so minor go without mention. (I don't know exactly what the site was, but sounds like nothing to get upset over)<br>  <br>  But really... he's not the 'sharpest crayon in the box' sweetie!  Anytime someone has to come back <AFTER the discussion> with a lame cover-up, that's way too long to come up with an excuse, and it's not true!  <br>  <br>  Talk to him and say you two obviously have some trust issues, either you care enough for one another to work on that to strengthen your relationship, or it's not worth fighting for.  Try to find the root of your trust issues and clear the air of any pent up suspicions either of you have if you want to make it work.|`|fR9KdYPpaa	No, dont apologise!<br>  <br>  The fact that he's being so rude and defensive means hes hiding something. If it was nothing then he would have just been a little embarressed & laughed it off.<br>  They arent recent emails so I think its silly for u both 2 break up over it. but do NOT apologise for it!|`|3qLIRorjaa	He's guilty so he's doing what any guilty person does and tries to blame the other person.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say sorry - i'd go ahead and pack my bags and leave.|`|AA11225089	Yes apologise but make it clear that he needs to be more honest with you, explain that you need to re build trust. He probably feels embarrassed about being caught out, and the fact that they date from last year suggests that he learnt his lesson and has behaved himself from then on. Avoid saying, 'you made me....' but say , 'i feel....'.|`|Jr5YZ8Qbaa	Sounds like he's feeling guilty and embarrassed about this and having been found out. He should be apologising to you. Maybe if you were snooping you owe him one too, but he's more in the wrong than you are. Either way it seems neither of you can trust the other.|`|AA11706291	No don't apologise to him he is making lame *** excuses.|`|pOCabUMvaa	How can it be your fault when he is the one doing it??<br>  <br>  If he keeps criticizing you, then is he really worth keeping in your life, for what he did in the past and probably is still doing in the future??<br>  <br>  He is only your boyfriend, I say dump the looser, and find a man who loves you for you, and praises you, instead of criticizing you!!!!!<br>  <br>  You need to be happy!|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	You caught him, and he's guilty as hell....therefore, he's trying to turn the tables and make you accept the guilt for finding this information.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	Need more information here....what is your relationship like other than some emails he received that you disapprove of?|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Why live with the perpetual feeling of doubt. Never settle for anything less than the best -- move on. It may not be easy but you won't have to keep wondering,|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	This is an act of guilt... he is doing it to make u look like the bad person & him the innocent one <br>  play along with him get super angry & if he leaves u he didnt want u to begin with|`|b1NMh5K2aa	No don't apologise hes making excuses...|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Good god - you have done nothing wrong! I should dump him if I were you. He won't change.|`|t3G5xSbIaa	lsn the choise will always be up to u but forgivness is the key to everything u'll find it in ur heart one day|`|vW7yI3Jnaa	well i would pack my bags and leave no man must speak to me that way!|`|e0yNUBd9aa	He is full of it.  It was not a trap.  He got busted and is trying to turn it around on you.  Because you ask if you should apologize it looks like his "turn it around" strategy has worked in the past.  He should be the one apologizing, not you.  On your way out the door tell him that all he had to do was apologize to you and promise it was not going to happen again.  I you don't want to find anything bad, go find a guy with nothing to hide that you can trust.|`|pJJyH3vhaa	Well I'm a guy and I think he is in the wrong here. Yeah, you were wrong to snoop but not as wrong as him for doing this. So unless he apologizes, you should not either.|`|657b064eb5cd0984478523a31970625caa	I'm probally getting thumbs down on this one...but here it goes.<br>  YOU ARE BOTH IN THE WRONG! Him, for still having the emails and trying to shift the blame to you. You, because you should not have been looking through his emails in the first place. And just a little piece of advise here, if you were looking to find something or he really did just put it there to trap you...then there is a real trust problem in your relationship and both of you should step back for sometime to think about if this relationship is what you really want. Trust is key.|`|Bn5JoVlLaa	nooooooooooooooo way dont say sorry he is been a total n utter prat!! do u honestly want to be withsomeone who 'sets a trap' we both know that that was only an excuse but call his bluff n ask him why he feels he was to trap u..in an open lovin relationship people have nuthing to hide and if u cant trust each other there is no point been together!!<br>  <br>  honestly pack ur bags he sounds like a pig u will be better off without..<br>  <br>  good luck hun find someone who treats u with respect and love|`|djUMvICoaa	I say pack your bags and be happy that you are rid of this loser now rather than later.  Anytime a guy puts up the defenses he has is usually hiding something.  He hasn't come clean with you.  If they were nothing he would have said he's sorry and went and got rid of them, it's that simple.  Instead he transferred it unto you, that you did something wrong.  He's not one that I would say would be in a open and honest relationship or one that I would say I could trust very far.  He's also a sorry excuse for a man.  I hope your bags are packed.
9QF6GGyiaa	No not weird at all. Its possible they're hanging out together because they relate to each other. You don't have to be a specific age to know who you're attracted to. Age really doesn't matter too much. Everyone is capable of knowing what they want. I've known girls who are a lesbian who are gorgeous. Its funny because they could probably get really good looking guys but that really doesn't matter. Hope this is what you were looking for =) .|`|EXdiDbTTaa	It's like asking, are you really straight if you are friends with girls or are you gay?<br>  Uhh, that makes no sense, people can still be friends you know.|`|8P6MmLv0aa	Don't worry about it, That's there Business anyway just because they are all dating its doesn't mean they are full time lesbians when girls are yong they experiment just like boys and if they are gay then so what, its life.<br>  When you get older and know more about life you will realise that there are more important things to think about.<br>  And if you're any kind of a man you would help them when they need it gay woman tend to get pick on some time so help them out if they need it. anyway take care|`|1WUnsLNyaa	A lot of girls, especially high school girls, try to be sexy by being lesbians. They think that's what guys want to see so they give it to them. i know plenty of girls that aren't gay but act bi so they can kiss girls at parties to become known as a sexy party girl. Some could really be gay, but i find it highly unlikely that all of them are. Some girls prey on attention and will go to great lengths to get it|`|AuWPMH44aa	i wuldnt say its wierd. if they like pu$$y, they like some pu$$y. so let them be. maybe they will have a 3some wit u so y dnt u try it out.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Why is it weird? Is it weird when there is a group of six straight friends?|`|8NajE933aa	No, I don't think it's weird.  They have something in common.  Gay people usually have gay friends.<br>  <br>  And I don't think they're faking.  Maybe one or two, but the majority not.<br>  <br>  Who says lesbians can't be feminine?  Actually, it makes sense for them to be feminine.  It's all about girls.  They have eliminated the need for the masculine element.  <br>  <br>  Being gay in your teens can be tough.  Finding out you're gay can be seriously traumatic.  These girls have all gone through similar experiences, and are all dealing with the reactions of breeders like us.  So they've banded together with people who understand them.<br>  <br>  That doesn't mean they're having a giant lesbian 6-some every Friday night.|`|5Y90tQwFaa	is it weird that you are friends with straight people?|`|s4KZRtF8aa	i dun think so
Gy8kmB6naa	YES, because he was my ex's friend and my brothers friend as well...but when i found out he had a couple kids and a gf...i really regretted it|`|uzXwM0Qzaa	Nope!
tBaCFTtBaa	no.. i never had my bf show me, but while im doing it i ask often if he likes it or wants me to do anything different.. they will guide you in the right direction :)  just try new techniques and i'm sure he'll cooperate.  good luck!|`|WYPEG8l7aa	No not really, if you're sexually active sexual questions aren't really that strange anymore. Unless its something really extreme like you suggesting dominatrix or something.|`|5nfqY9T7aa	No, I wouldn't think so.  I think he'd be more than happy to tell you how he likes it.  It will improve your love life.|`|2aab9990f44abc785cfb7c119b182bdeaa	believe me he shall be delighted<br>  he will be happier if you teach him how to rub yurself<br>  all guys like to talk about it and learn all tricks of sex|`|za9b8cHKaa	He'd probably be more than happy to tell you! After all, it benefits him.|`|gNFPy6S0aa	He ought to find that rather gratifying.|`|yDTUi1cMaa	no, i guarantee you he would love it.|`|AA11064112	There is nothing wrong with that coz any sensible man in true love would even cherish you more knowing that u value him and would want to cement your love life by doing acts that would please him and you. Start tonight and say' honey what turns you on? and from his answer you will get some ideas of act that you dont do that you should start doing. All the best!|`|ssjg2wVvaa	no , it would show him that you want to pleasure him better and he may of been wanting to tell you in a while, but didn;t want to make u think u were bad at it|`|T0mrWughaa	not really...depending on how openly you guys talk about sex......if you rarely bring the topic up then yes im guessing it would be wierd,but i would still ask,it'll open more doors for you guys to talk more often|`|AA11851541	Just watch porn...|`|TWm5Smlaaa	no, he would get probably get turned on!|`|igiCJuF9aa	nope, just say, show me how you like it
IXskJPlVaa	He has some deep feelings for you and you also seem to be interested in him. Whenever he is making a pass. reciprocate - have frank talk and see where it leads. Don't rush and go slow but don't stand still also. Best of luck.
AA10199189	say mom i would like to go to the EARLY SHOW with my boyfriend, of whom you approve.  i will be back at about 9:30, thanks mom!|`|BYHRjUa6aa	Say nicely, "Mom, I'd like to go see the movie Twilight with my boyfriend. I'd leave at about 7 and get back at about 9. Can I please go?"|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Just ask and say please mom!|`|AA12396274	ask your mom if she will give you permission to go,|`|Z5FRK2H6aa	twilight is not even that good you should watch something else.|`|5wt0En1Zaa	Watch an earlier show.  If it isn't possible, tell her don't you promise you won't be home late and you'll do good in your homework. Tell your mum you will call her as soon as the film finishes and when you get to the cinema.  Tell her your capable of something like this and you won't take advantage of it. You are 16 and you should be aloud to do this. How long have you known this boy for? Do you trust him?  Hopefuly she'll let you.  Oh and twilight is AMAZING!!! You'll love it :)

Also, BOYS around your age don't know anything about girls. They only think they know. I suggest you keep up with your school and continue focusing like you seem to be doing. You seem to be a very mature young lady and that's very admirable.|`|TVgnlEuqaa	Hun, not all boys are like this, you don't have to be like all of the other girls to get a boy.

How could you not know she was standing there?  I think you are exhibitionists and even discussing this on Y!A is somehow arousing to you.  I think you're a child abuser and the sad thing is when the little girl goes to tell someone someday, because her situation is so covert, people will minimize it even though it was clearly harmful because she was intentionally used by her parents for their gratification.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	convince her patiently. be cautious in explaining her.take pains.|`|52117dcb7416ab916ef6426b49b50ab6aa	WOW..WOW I have a ten year old boy and a six year old girl so I consider myself to be a professional in that way.  You do what you are doing now by talking to her but I think therapy will be in order now.  She is traumatized by what she saw..understandably but where are the scared feelings coming from.  Is your hubby her dad?  Get her help cause SHE WILL act out what she saw between you guys through interaction with other kids.  You can't solve this by talking to her and explaining to her what happen.  Solving this will require a patient, progress that you MUST do with a license therapist.  You will be sorry if you think you can just sweep it under the rug or hope she somehow forgets.  but I do kinda wondering how your daughter was able to watch THE WHOLE THING, you didn't have a "feeling" that there were eyes around.  How did you not hear her.  Well it is too late for should've, would've, could'ves.  Now you must engage in intense damage control.|`|hHndD5SEaa	You're just going to have to sit her down and explain the facts of life to her.... buy her a childs book on exlpaining the birds and the bees in an easier way.<br>  She seems quite traumatised by this experience- more so than I would imagine she should..I cant see why you would think she needs councilling - I think having a proper discussion with your daughter should suffice?<br>  And for future reference - CLOSE YOUR DOOR!!<br>  xx
wzqahEqiaa	I'm a woman and I wouldn't be with any man who had a relationship with my mom.  It would freak me out if a guy was comparing me (physically and emotionally) to my mom.  The step dad isn't biologically related to the step daughter so it doesn't seem quite as strange.<br>  <br>  I'm 25 years old and my parents have been faithfully married for almost 35 years.  Marriage even after divorce has meaning to me.  In marriage people are joined together by commitment and physically in body.  I could never forget the fact that a marriage existed.  I would be thinking about what's written in the Bible "the two become one flesh."  Mark 10:8-9|`|gVITlOMUaa	seeing that the former step father is obviously older than the former step daughter he should wise up and use some common sense and look for someone outside of the family circle.

I'd suggest that this relationship is hostile towards the mother.  A therapist would suggest the same.  Why would the daughter hurt the mother in such a way.  Its obvious why the step father would hurt the mother.  What will happen next, the step father decides, after having children with the daughter that he wants to be with her mother, and he's made a mistake?  Yeah, you should speak up. It has more to do with the daughter's feelings, what about her mother?  How old is this girl anyway?  18 yrs?  Its a pretty immature decision.|`|uIaD4nkMaa	That.  Is.  Disgusting.<br>  <br>  What age was she when the man was married to her mother?<br>  <br>  Because it's even worse if he was her stepdad when she was a kid.|`|fR9KdYPpaa	Dude...thats disusting!<br>  <br>  As it hasnt crossed any legal boundaries, u cant really do anything about it.

l7fyLFFtaa	That sounds nice. It's hard to suggest or approve a birthday gift for someone we don't know, but I would add a few things to his birthday:<br>  <br>  1. Cook him his favorite meal for dinner (or at least something that he really likes and that you can cook).<br>  2. Buy his favorite ice cream for dessert.<br>  3. Rent his favorite movie or a guy's movie he hasn't seen but may really enjoy. No chick flicks. This is his day.<br>  4. I know it sounds corny but I have always dug the whole personal coupon thing. You know, pieces of paper stapled together with things like "Good for one hour of Xbox any time you want to play" or "Good for one dinner of your choice (as long as we have the food in the cupboard or refrigerator)". Fun stuff like that. It's great for guys if you have a couple of intimate ones as well.<br>  <br>  Have fun.|`|LrBYeb6Aaa	yeah i think thats a lovely idea, just to be a bit personal put a nice pair of underwear in there of urs, that will make his day,|`|AA11701826	That sounds really good, add a letter just thanking him...|`|h8mTcbjIaa	yea that is so sweet|`|fc6ee0dd138f1cb865fc7b3c849c4fe2aa	Write your heart out, he will love having a great gall like your self that loves him for who he is. tell him (in your writing) the things you love the most about him or about a wonderful time the two of you shared, write a little message on the back of the pictures and tell him you love him, because it's the little things that mean the most. hope this was helpful.|`|eS63CfSLaa	Hi Linz,<br>  <br>  This sounds like a lovely present.

ZuTvyfY7aa	Okay you just need a love doctor like me! haha naw im just kidding!<br>  <br>  In anycase, the first things first you need to ask yourself is if you can stay with that guy being happy together. If your answer is yes, move on to next paragraph, if not, its probably just a crush and you'll need to rethink about the oncoming relationship.<br>  <br>  Okay I'm not exactly an expert on this but ill help out as much as I can. <br>  <br>  1. First things first, what do you like the most about him? If you like him for say...his awesome greek god muscles then perhaps when you see him during psy. ed class you should compliment about his strengths BUT do not make any sudden comments (like saying i have a crush on you and i like you) or he may take it the wrong way and drive him away instead. Keep it simple and steady first.<br>  <br>  2. Now after you done that, find out about what he likes to do/eat/have from his closer friends. Ask them in a neutral tone so that you dont blow your cover. Once you got that sorted out, do that action during a special occasion like say...his birthday or after exams. Something like "Hey if you are free tonight, would you like to see a movie with me?"<br>  <br>  3. Most importantly, hint it to him progressively in that manner (being friends with him and just having a good time as friends first) find out more about him and once you are getting close to him, pop to him the million dollar question and see what happens next!<br>  <br>  No.3 is quite important as you can build a closer and more understanding relationship with him, as well as to see more of his inner characteristics and check to see if hes suitable to you or not.<br>  <br>  I wish you the best of luck!|`|D2vVMbdlaa	be a secret admirer to him, ( if you're nervous) give him some riddles or a friendly letter but make sure he understands the riddle.<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  Do you love him or just like him, like a crush?<br>  <br>  if a crush, go and be brave it's only a crush but if you know what his reaction is going to be, (if he gets angry or something negative) avoid my advice #2. <br>  <br>  if you love him take your time and take it easy, step by step.. but if you notice that he is liking someone then make sure you go active about it or it will be a tragedy for you,.<br>  <br>  but anyway... gUd LuCk!!!

You don't sound very caring to me, you  sound agro and defensive. Women get pleasure from sex just as much as men do, that dosent make them sl*ts.  It is a very natural biological process.  Just because they are different from you, and you don't understand them, shouldn't mean that you should hate them and be nasty. <br>  I have a lot of male & female friends, some who have chosen to be 'virgins' for various reasons; not one of them talks badly of the opposite sex the way you have done. <br>  I say give us girls a break!|`|Mrg4DpK1aa	you basically answered that question for yourself, you see how u think of women and that answers why they reject/block you.

UNV1I5Ogaa	I don't think it is a rebound because she dumped you. She might have met someone who suited her. It happens.|`|SsB7aRExaa	Rebounds don't usually work, but there are exceptions.<br>  <br>  <br>  Rebound or not, it's time for you to move on!|`|Xr5bU3t1aa	If she's been able to resolve these questions and answers to her own satisfaction, then her marriage may be just fine.  However... if she has not, then yes...it may just be a rebound and it will be a difficult road ahead for her if nothing was resolved.|`|PkDokr8Iaa	My question for you is:  why do you care?  She is your ex; and although I can appreciate you still being hurt over the breakup, and that you still care for her; you need to realize that she has moved on, and you need to do the same.<br>  <br>  Do 'rebound' relationships work: that is up to the two people involved, there is no one answer, too many grey areas.<br>  <br>  Do yourself a favor and put the past where it belongs.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	It wasn't rebound, this was a man she has obviously been in contact with privately for a while.  It sounds like she purposely moved to that state to be with him.<br>  <br>  Real question should be, why do you care if it is a rebound marriage or not?  She's not in your life anymore, you need to move on.|`|djUMvICoaa	A rebound marriage to me is one where you dropped out of one relationship and into another and then married that person.  Most people need some time in between relationships in order to drop the extra baggage that relationship brought them so that they don't take it into a new one.  This time is usually 3 to 6 months.  Otherwise it's just like a kid in a candy store, you see something else you want you drop what you have and go after it even if you're not sure why you are going after it.   If she had some time in between, then I would say no.  But even that doesn't give us her reasons why and that could make it a yes.  Rebound marriages are usually doomed because they are entered into without eyes wide open.  They sometimes work in that some people feel more secure in something rather than out of something, but that usually leads to other problems.  At this point you are probably better off.  Would you want to be married to someone that may be making bad choices in life?  Time to put it behind you and move on.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Sounds like she was lonely in her new home.  It isn't necessarily about you and your break up. For all you know she may have been talking to this guy on-line for months and he's the reason she moved to being with.  Stop beating yourself up over her and move on with your life.  If there are a lot of questions lingering, it's because she's been lying to you for a long time.  Feeding you what you want to hear so you didn't catch on to what she was really doing.  Move on, there are a lot more fish in the sea.  Why hang on to an old carp?  Go find an Angel Fish.|`|IaMByOjFaa	I think she did it in case the other didn't work out.
b4859935d2256537b4d4fe1dd1d4888faa	Sounds like you need lots of (grilled) chicken, fish, eggs and cheese, fruits, and water.  Don't eat rice, mashed potatoes, drink milk or pop (not even diet soda, it stretches out your stomach), and put down the sweets!  <br>  Walk briskly for thirty minutes a day, and no hard core cardio or weight lifting as that will burn more energy and make you more hungry.<br>  This is a diet plan (plus veggies) that the doctor gave my husband to lose weight.

So you can go for one time to get the information and go from there. But I think weight watchers works the best.

Some people find that having 6-8 small "snacks" per day is better than 3 meals.  I'm like that.  <br>  Figure out how your body works.  For me, I either need to have a big breakfast, or small snacks every 1-2 hours in the mornings.  After 12 pm though my body doesn't really get hungry at all, until maybe 6 pm or 7 pm.  <br>  <br>  Start having things like tomatoes, yogurt, oatmeal, eggs are good, carrots as well.

Think about what you would REALLY want if she were still available to you... if you had to pick between the two. Your first feeling was correct when you told your ex that she would find someone better. It's difficult now because this is the first time you've seen her with someone else... it's just possessiveness rearing its ugly head. I'm sure you still mean a lot to her, but she finally realized the truth: that the two of you just don't belong together, for many possible reasons. <br>  <br>  If things don't get better, I would suggest you try to slowly wean off your friendship with her. The more you see her, especially with her boyfriend, the more jealous it could make you... and those feelings of jealousy could trick you into thinking you have authentic romantic feelings for her when you really don't. You're happier now, and have been for a long time. Keep that in mind.<br>  <br>  Trust me, I know firsthand. Those feelings of envy have led me to very stupid mistakes in my love life. They still tempt me from time to time... I've gotten back with people only to discover a very speedy few hours in that I made a mistake. Deal with these feelings and conquer them. Don't make a decision you'll always regret.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	Honestly it sounds like you liked the fact that someone was still wanting you and that you were flattered, she moved on and you miss the feeling of importance maybe? <br>  <br>  It happens all the time, you made your choice to be with the new girl and you know it the right one, so you got to carry on.|`|kgIccwR0aa	apparently ur feelings r tied up in da past but sumtimes it could be just carring 4 her and da jealous part iz quit normal as time goes by u ll get used 2 it.but u do hv 2 ask urself before its 2 late who do u feel more 4 when get through dat phase u ll know da answer.|`|6Yaje1qbaa	oh man... this is suck..<br>  how could that happened..<br>  i think, you are in love with your ex..<br>  you just like your new gf...<br>  it's ot the same...<br>  if i were you..<br>  i will choose my ex..<br>  make a decision..<br>  before it's too late dude...|`|lUrJDOBOaa	Its like that Usher song<br>  My heart is in two different places<br>  I've got you in my life and i want to do right, but i just can't let her go<br>  and my love has two different faces<br>  Someone tell me what's man to do<br>  when he's loving two<br>  he don't want to lie, but he can't tell the truth<br>  what's a man to do when he's loving tow<br>  but he can't keep his heart in two different places.<br>  <br>  You can't keep your heart in two different places so where does your heart belong?|`|4USvZW6vaa	you really need to start thinking about which one of those two u really love... cuz u are waisting years of ur "love life" confusing ur self about who is the one for you.. you need time apart from them and think who means the most to you.. they maybe lovely and all that but u need to get deep on this.. no advise or person in the world can help u need to do it on ur own..<br>  good luck...:)|`|lSGNCKitaa	You still have feeling for your ex, if you're thinking about her, jealous of her man, there's still a little something there.<br>  Have you ever thought about just taking a break just to get your feelings straight? just so you can see who it is that you lvoe.<br>  <br>  it is possible to love two people though, just choose wisley who you choose.|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	U want the cake, and u want to eat the cake<br>  U have to be disciplined in love, now that u have taken the choice stick to the new girl, don't go back to the old.

Just let them know you love them and want to stay part of their lives no matter what happens between you and their father. I am also going through a divorve myself and my soon to be ex isn't my 2 oldest boys dad but he still talks to them on a regular basis. The boys know that it doesn't matter if we are together or not he is still their dad and that will never change. Just keep your head up and remember it may be the best thing for them as well if there is a lot of conflict in front of them, it isn't good for them either. Just be there for them as much as you can and constantly let them know you love them no matter what.|`|6wzQhsIkaa	You could still work out a visitation agreement. Has the mother signed away her rights, if so, you could possibly get partial custody. I knew a man who had sole custody of a stepchild from a previous marriage.|`|417a83c7cb091ac86d2ec601c9b825e2aa	YOU are right, going to counseling is not going to make you love him again. I applaud you for loving these children. I assure you, if you talk to them, and explain your actions, they will understand. When you file for divorce , you can ask for visitation rights and they will be granted since you have beent he only mother they have ever known. Good luck to ya, I know this is hard, but if you have to go, you have to go! Just go about it in the right way and you will still have them in your life.|`|IXskJPlVaa	You seem to be a very caring lady - and in a fix. You have reached the end of the road as far as your husband is concerned - so no point staying back not even for the sake of the kids. It doesn't work. First thing - move out. If you can manage and acceptable to all concerned - take the children along. Else work-out a way where you can be in constant touch with them and do whatever you can to help them. Best of luck.|`|CwNMq7RTaa	stay until the children are grown.  your need to be loved is not as important as their need for a mother.  you can get love after they leave.|`|AA10065812	I sent your question to my second wife and youngest daughter.  They continued their relationship after the divorce.|`|EZKe92TTaa	You are dealing with two separate issues, the legal ones regarding the kids and your emotional ones. Your emotional issues are obvious, but since you aren't their biological mother I don't know what you can do if you leave their father. You never legally adopted them, did you? If your husband is smart and will take the children's needs into consideration, he may let you remain in their lives as any two parents do after a separation. But I don't think he has to from a legal point of view. You should get some proper legal counseling to see whether you have any legal claim regarding the children (since 10 years is a long time) before you make your move out of the house. Regarding whether you should leave or not, do not stay in a loveless marriage, unless you think some marriage counseling should come first. Would you be willing to consider that? Don't abandon the marriage and kids without knowing that you tried everything to change things around. If you have done everything, then you have to save yourself and find happiness, even if it means not being with these children. I hope you find the happiness you desire and can remain in the children's lives.<br>  <br>  Edit: I hear you, feel your pain. Counseling will give you the opportunity to get everything out in the open, his side as well as yours. Marriage counselors know how to steer the sessions to get the most out of it and act as an objective third party so you can see if there's anything to save in this marriage or not. You've been very hurt. Whether you want to bother with therapy is up to you obviously. But before you take action find all the information you need (legal counseling, etc) so you know what your rights will be regarding the kids. You can e mail me if you wish. Good luck to you.|`|iogL3GFVaa	You need to look out for you. If your husband is driving you crazy, then you need to get out. <br>  But the children may not be "yours" but you raised them and you love them. I would be devastated if I could no longer talk to my step mother of 12yrs. <br>  I think that you need to look out for yourself, but maybe you can talk to the children and give them the choice of talking to you. You will have no legal options to see the children, but they can talk to you if they want, and they are old enough to make that disision. It will be hard either way for you.<br>  I pray that everything works out for the best for you.|`|NLEmQZSsaa	Well, If he's as big a jerk as you've explained here, he may just give them to you in the divorce. Then again, he could fight you for them and still ignore them.  I would first talk to him about legally adopting the children then if you can and you do, then you can divorce him and take the children with you. It's all about being creative.|`|oPy0n9nGaa	I was in the same shoes as you are now 4 many years too. I was very unhappy. I did leave and it was very hard at first.Now I look back and my kids and I are very close and very happy.It will be hard for you and your step kids at first but, it will change and you will be much happier as time goes on.Try and set it up were you can see the kids whenever you want to.As time goes one they will see a different person in you a much happier person.|`|MuVKeK8faa	1. Go to counseling.<br>  2.  He needs to go to the doctor.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	I'm sorry, but if you are truly miserable and unloved, why did you marry this man?  Have you talked to him about how you're feeling?<br>  <br>  Yes!  Do counseling!  Do what you can to save the marriage if you really love the kids.  You can love your husband again, but it will require work on both sides.  Usually when critisism and cursing eachother out is happening your marriage has gotten into a really bad state, it's like sulphuric acid, but with care and love and work it could be restored.
s8cZsSX0aa	Everyone kisses differently, While I can't tell you how to kiss, I can give you pointers to keep in mind to make your first experience more enjoyable.<br>  <br>  <br>    Stinky breath is bad<br>    Breathe through your nose while engaged in kissing, keep your nasal passages cleaned, no one wants to here breathing through the nose while in a psssionate moment.<br>    Tongues should meet somewhere in the middle.<br>    Soft tongue movements not sloppy one. Remember not to bite down, as  first contact does have a completely different feeling that you've ever felt before.<br>    Chap stick is your friend, no one wants sand paper against their lips.<br>    Always tilt head slightly to the right side.<br>    <br>  <br>  <br>  After a good kiss your lips will be slightly wet but not so much as you should need to wipe them. <br>  <br>  <br>  Last but not least don't be pressured into kissing, by friends or even the person you are dating. You will definately know when the time comes that you are ready. The best things come to those that wait. Hope this was of at least a little help.|`|cWuumdy7aa	A French kiss or snog is a kiss, usually romantic or sexual in nature, in which one participant's tongue touches the other's tongue and usually enters his or her mouth.<br>  <br>  It is referred colloquially as soul kissing, tongue kissing, tongue fighting, pash, hooking up, getting in with, busting slob, mugging it up, making-out, macking on, meeting, shifting, necking, getting into, snog, slipping the tongue, popping tongue, sucking face, swapping spit, deep kissing, getting off with, pulling, tongue wrestling, slug wrestling, tonsil tennis, tonsil ping-pong, tonsil hockey,Pontang,Going with Frencher (Quebec) and frenching. An older name for 'French kissing' is cataglottis, from cata (down), glottis (throat). In French, it is simply embrasser avec la langue (literally, to kiss with the tongue) or the slang version rouler une pelle (to roll a shovel), or "rouler un patin" (to roll a skate (as in ice-skate, or roller-skate)), or "p√©cho", which derives from "chop√©" ("to catch" in slang).<br>  <br>  French kissing stimulates the lips, tongue and mouth, which are all areas very sensitive to touch, and the practice is considered to be pleasurable, highly intimate, and sexually arousing. Unlike other forms of kissing (such as brief kisses in greeting or friendship), episodes of French kissing may often be prolonged, intense, and passionate. Because of its potential for arousing sexual feelings in bystanders (or outrage, amusement, derision, or disgust), 'French kissing' as a public display of affection is typically discouraged in most parts of the world.<br>  <br>  Studying animal behavior, , an evolutionary biologist, argues that the French kiss has a real function: to explore the sexual partner's immune system via the saliva. Initiating the sexual desire, the French kiss allows the partners to avoid inbreeding (<br>  The exchange of saliva in a French kiss may increase the chances of catching an orally transmitted disease such as Infectious mononucleosis|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	whatever way you do, it is the feeling of closeness which matters.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	Just go with the flow and do what you feel's right.

NLEmQZSsaa	First of all, most parents are protective of their children.  Second, I wouldn't worry about what everybody says. I know its hard not too, but after graduation everyone goes their seperate ways and all you really have are.......your parents  Most kids get somewhat depressed after they graduate high school, especially if they don't know what to do with their future.  Those kids that call you names will all be in the same boat as you after graduation when once again your no one special.

You know she's a liar at the very least.  Contact with and ex is a sign she's not over him or that he has some power over her that you don't.  I think you ran into the problem right at the start.  I would never again date someone who just broke up with someone.  Two reasons, 1. She might not really be over him yet and you are Mr. Right Now instead of Mr. Right.  2.  We all need time in between relationships.  We have to get our head back on straight and get rid of all the crazy things that the relationship did to us.  You should understand that very well right now, it's going to take you some time to get her out of your system, get your head back on straight and know that you have put things at rest from the relationship.  When these things aren't done, we go into a relationship with eyes only half open, we carry crap from the last relationship and dump it on the other person.  That's not fair to them or you.  You are not going to make a good decision that way.  They say usually 3 to 6 months to drop that baggage.|`|hJZWMkFZaa	sorry dude, but she's not over her ex, she's trying to see if he will change, she's using you.<br>  sorry man

The problem with girls and guys is that girls often read too much into what guys do, and guys often don't read enough into what girls do. <br>  <br>  just brush off his comment and allow him to keep talking to you and whatever|`|JH6oCuUZaa	Do you really need reassurance this guy likes you?  Stop wasting good questions when the answers are obvious.
eS63CfSLaa	Hi Raptor,<br>  <br>  Ok, questions first.<br>  <br>  1- How old are you? <br>  2- Is this your first relationship? I only ask because you mention her kissing you on the cheek.<br>  3- How long have you been in this relationship?<br>  <br>  Saying "I Love You" to someone is a big thing, and can be difficult. Girls find it easier to be open with their emotions than boys do, so don't be too tough on yourself. I can't tell you how to tell your girlfriend that you love her but I can tell you this:<br>  <br>  - Two is company, three is a crowd. The two of you should be communicating with each other, not through a third party- this friend. As the saying goes, too many cooks spoil the broth. It really isn't any of her/his business.<br>  - you are absolutely correct, telephones are out of the equation here. Although you might suck (your words) at face- to- face conversations, it is important that you tell you girlfriend that you love her (if you really do) when you are with her. It should be something you are able to do naturally. Love is a feeling, it is not robotic, engineered or exchanged. You shouldn't feel pressured to say that you love her too, just because she got in there with an "I Love You' before you did.<br>  - ask yourself, how do you feel around her. Does she make you feel happy? Do you miss her when she's not with you? Do you look forward to seeing her? If yes, then what are you waiting for? Be courageous and the next time you are together, look her in the eyes & tell her how you feel.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. All the best.<br>  <br>  Love & Blessings<br>  <br>  x|`|0kT9vgGxaa	buy her a rose and go up to her give her the rose and tell her something really sweet and tell her you love her...<br>  If you need to make it cheesy and she will really like it like :P|`|lhrMI9f5aa	Why don't you tell her someplace special, the place you first met maybe, or a fancy restaurant or maybe give her a present, jewelery maybe, just something to show her how much you really love her.|`|lhqM4qhxaa	be comfortable of the situation, if u really love her then say it its so romantic if u will tell her when you both are together. i believe if you love somebody u will care much, words counts too but actions speaks more. good luck!|`|lXBVrik7aa	Well, you are going out with her so she probably has some idea, maybe some time when you are alone together, or just mention it casually when she is walking away.

Good luck|`|Jf5h5OPCaa	If you really love her, it wouldn't be this hard to say.<br>  <br>  But you can tell her face to face without actually "saying" it. You can trace her back with your finger and ask her to guess what you are spelling out. and write " I L O V E Y O U" and she will get the vibe and say it back ;)|`|qIEhu6uxaa	you love each other but you've never even kissed?  how old are you?  i don't think you're ready for love my dear but i guess if you feel it then say it.  its super nerve wracking but itll come out.  just say it when you're ready, your mouth will do it on its own.|`|5EFJlIJSaa	Just go ahead and say..<br>  Or Give her a rose... red....<br>  But seriously its better if you just say it....|`|8Loq9Skraa	Just say it, its not that hard!|`|0PsnnVb6aa	wen she says 'i love you' you just repeat wat she said and add a 'too' to the sentence...rmbr to keep a shy/happy face...

This is what I think about the situation from my own experiences.<br>  <br>  1) If the reason why you are grossed out is because of the way it "feels" when your tongues touch, ask him to be patient with you. You will eventually get used to it. I can't imagine not being used to it though. My first kiss had allot of tongue and I loved it.<br>  <br>  2) If the reason why you are grossed out is because of the way his tongue tastes, then you will never be happy kissing him. You are not going to be satisfied with every tongue out there. If this option is your case, I don't know what to tell you. Either keep kissing him without tongue, or move on to someone better.|`|3HGAZDL6aa	just do what feels natural and comfortable, if your not ready to use tongues, tell him genly that you prefer kissing with just lips for now, if hes a nice guy he will understand.<br>  and maybe as you get more comfortable together, you can take things further,<br>  certainly dont do something you dont like just cos he wants to.|`|ymqRux3xaa	Kissing is an art. I relate it to eating a ripe peach. Soft, wet and succulent.|`|ilG7IV0aaa	just make out geez. it's not that bad. there's no really right or wrong.|`|820fcc25e1d405c3b1bd1d47e46df2b2aa	I remember my first experience of kissing with tongue, it wasn't something I enjoyed too much. Don't rush into anything you feel uncomfortable about. <br>  <br>  When you feel ready, let your lips loosen up a bit, so that you are both opening and closing them against each other (snogging), with your heads tilted in opposite directions (watch TV/films, see how they do it). Move your tongue forward a bit to touch his. <br>  <br>  I always find the lips are more important. My first kiss with my husband was wet and involved a lot of his tongue, not a great first kiss, but with practise he relaxed, learnt to control his tongue and focus on his lips action instead - now it's amazing!
LguXFbvsaa	It took me a while before I really started dating guys too. I was probably around that age - 16 - when I finally did. Then I went boy-crazy and dated and dated and dated. My priorities were a little screwy at that age, I guess. You shouldn't worry about feeling awkward or shy; mostly everyone is at that age. Looking back, I'm so glad that I kept so many of my younger years to myself, and didn't worry about guys. People deserve a real childhood, and to grow independently - not use relationships as a crutch, or pursue them out of desperate necessity. Take your time. Relax. Have fun in life and remain secure in your choices. Men/boys are always attracted to that. You put yourself first... and the boy thing will follow close behind.<br>  <br>  Enjoy.|`|0fwQcC50aa	haaha exactly the same here... they'll come to you. If you like a guy just be friendly most guys see little things bigger if they like you...( I'm trying to say if you're friendly, if he likes you, he will think you're flirting and he'll get the hint)<br>  <br>  But be careful don't lead them on if you don't like them.|`|3lKAR9G2aa	Boy, I sure don't miss those days.  It probably doesn't help, but it gets a little easier as you get older.  At least it did for me.  Everyone feels awkward at some time.  Try thinking of your good qualities to boost your confidence, then go for it.  Just be patient, you'll be fine.|`|FE0PRaJnaa	Try to make friends with a few boys before leaping into a relationship, get comfortable around them before you start anything serious. good luck!

18ncelEeaa	Sex does hurt for the first time but it doesn't hurt as much people say it does. I lost my virginity to my boyfriend when i was 14 and we are still together 2 years on and have a 10 week old baby. Some guys do leave you after what they get what they want but some don't. If you are worried about becoming pregnant make sure he puts the condom on properly then you will have a less chance of it breaking. If it does break just tell him to pull out. Before you do it with this guy make sure he hasn't got any infections or an std and make sure you trust him as some guys can lie about whether they have an std or not. My first time i didn't bleed then the second time i did bleed  but there wasn't a lot of blood but was bleeding for a day or two after. If you're worried about it hurting tell him to go slow and then after a while if you're confident enough tell him to go faster but the way you want it is entirely up to you.|`|SFu6L2Ghaa	Not everyone bleeds the 1st time... and you don't bleed a lot... AND you can get stds and thats pretty much all you can get if it breaks... but you can get crabs from the guy... and if the condom breaks pull his dong out and stand up. The Semen or whatever will come out if you do that... And Use troajans... :) theyre good ANND Change condoms often... Like don't use one 2 times.... >.> change them when you think you should... :)|`|6jhDL35Gaa	Don't do it!|`|l4rFmqnAaa	sex is bad|`|0IjomiJ2aa	I assume that you are not married. Your sex is sure to be overrated in that case. Your covenant with each other will GREATLY add to your excitement. Without it there is a world of needless guilt and personal anxiety.|`|FzFSzilmaa	bleeding happens the first time... and depends on many things as to the amount...<br>  <br>  just accept it is normal and don't let that put you off...<br>  <br>  condoms hardly ever break.. as long as they are within the "use by" date... and a reputable make...<br>  <br>  if you have all these anxieties, perhaps you shouldn't rush into having sex...|`|8WYFLp1Baa	USE A CONDOM NO MATTER WHAT.<br>  The chances of it breaking inside you are extremely unlikely.<br>  If you don't use a condom you'll get pregnant.<br>  Seriously though, you sound too young for sex.|`|09zVUMBRaa	Ask your mom.|`|jYMlAN4Paa	Actually, if you don't know the answers to these questions and you haven't talked to your gynocologist and had an exam yet...then you are too young and immature to be having sex. It's that simple.<br>  <br>  Bleeding is different for everyone. I bled a lot about an hour or so after my first time. Had to go to the hospital, called my OBGYN...found out that I have a medical condition that can cause sex to be extremely painful. But, that's me. However, I can't stress enough how important it is for you to see your gynocologist, have an annual exam, ask questions and get the correct information you need on birth control. <br>  <br>  Going fast or slow sometimes doesn't matter when it comes to pain. Slower may cause more. Faster may cause more. Every woman's body is different.<br>  <br>  Yes the condom can break which is why gynocologists and other docs will tell you that it's a good idea, if you do not want to get pregnant but you want to have sex, that you take birth control pills or have other back up methods. There are many different kinds of bc pills and it sometimes takes a while to find the right one for you. You also have to take them correctly and know which medications (over the counter or prescription) that can make them ineffective. <br>  <br>  If the condom breaks, you have an excellent chance of becoming pregnant. You can always take Plan B (no, it's not an abortion pill) immediately but it's not something you want to depend on as birth control. You can also get any STD's or HIV/AIDS that he has....then again, you can get some of those anyway with the condom.<br>  <br>  Ask yourself what you'll do if you become pregnant. Are you financially stable and ready for it? Do you have a job, responsibilities, pay rent, etc? Are you honestly mature enough to handle the emotional/physical/psychological effects/responsibility that comes with having sex?<br>  <br>  Like I said.....if you have to ask all these questions to people like us without a medical license and who are not your gynocologist, then <br>  you are not ready for this.|`|mUWcPX6taa	Well when i first had sex with my girlfriend who was also a virgin she didnt bleed too much. just have tissue or paper towels in reach or maybe even a normal towel. it wasnt bad, and yes the slower and more carefully done will make it easier, but no matter what it will hurt. and it will for the next few times but after that it will be great. and condomas can break on rare occasions, but if you have a new trojan condom it should be fine. but if it does and he's still inside of you, then you can get pregnant even if he doesnt ejaculate inside of you and depending on whether he has an std depends on if you get it too if it breaks. but i'm sure it will be just fine :)|`|vRXtz76Iaa	It depends on how its all done. I mean, for one; YOU SHOULD TAKE IT SLOW... Get comfortable, it‚Ä≤ll hurt less and help u get use to it... Two, yes, the condom can RIP but its not going to get stuck inside you... and three, if you‚Ä≤re worried about health issues, YOU should think about it.. I mean, THINK about the one who u will be doing it with.. No you trust him or know he is healthy? When a guy says its his first time, it isn‚Ä≤t always true... Sex is an amazing experience that you should share with someone special that you trust and feel safe and comfortable with... So all I can say is becareful and don‚Ä≤t rush if you go through with it.. TAKE IT SLOW AND MAKE SURE YOU‚Ä≤RE COMFORTALE DOING IT... Good Luck..|`|0DdSoi4Maa	You should be worried about more than just bleeding.  I mean if you have a menstrual cycle it should be nothing to you.  But yeah it's going to hurt, so yes slow is very good.  Just when you do it if it hurts, tell him or tell him to go slower.  I would be worried more about the results from the condom breaking like, becoming pregnant, contracting std's or hiv.|`|VvNKTFhJaa	There may and may not be bleeding. If your hymn is intact, you will bleed. And yes there will be pain too but it will be a pleasurable pain.<br>  Above both also depend on his size and your shape. If he is big and you are small down there, it will be more painful.|`|G0wXt0mlaa	Either you're gonna have sex or you're not.<br>  The amount of blood doesn't even matter cause you're not gonna die. If going slower hurts less, tell him too go slower. If the condom breaks, then I hope you take birth control.|`|qDWuMuwZaa	use lubricant and if your worried about your condom to break it wont, just use it properly|`|qJTS4WBoaa	By the sound of your question, you're not ready for sex.|`|NbmnWwqEaa	You're not old enough if you do not know the answer to these questions. This is covered by your mother, and you should ask her about it. <br>  <br>  You are too young if you are under the age of 18-years-old and still in high school. Hands down.<br>  <br>  He will leave you after you give up your "gift" of your virginity; which should be saved for your husband. Then, at 18 or older, if you decide you do not wish to ever marry, you can make an ADULT decision to share your special gift (your virginity) with a man who respects you enough to wait until you are of age to make adult decisions.<br>  <br>  You cannot make adult decisions until you are, legally, an adult.<br>  <br>  And he will leave you, no longer a virgin, if you give in to him.<br>  <br>  I know . . . I'm a psychic. I guarantee it.<br>  <br>  Slower, by the way, will be much more painful! The bleeding may or may not be bad . . .<br>  <br>  Health risks are . . . pregnancy, STDs and the guy leaving you "ruined" and a reputation for "giving out" and making you a slut and then every guy will feel they have a "right" to you.<br>  <br>  And when you do grow up and become an adult . . .you will forever regret giving your precious virginity to some jerk in school!<br>  <br>  Just imagine you were older and had a daughter your age. Do you want her innocence given to some guy at your age?! Because one day, when you have a daughter your age (now), you will not stop her from doing what you are planning on doing.<br>  <br>  I mean, if you did it at this age . . . why shouldn't she?<br>  You will regret this.
OxnFnyqPaa	I honestly like simple guys.<br>  Those guys who will notice me when nobody else does? You know what I mean?<br>  Oh well I personally don't care a lot about looks, but it matters I'm not gonna pretend it doesn't coz I can't like someone as a "partner" if I'm not physically attracted to this person, if that's the case I will only like him as a friend.<br>  I want anything romantic. Sometimes even giving me something or anything that you know I like will surely make my day.<br>  For example, I love football (soccer) and I have never been to a stadium and watched a live match, (due to some cultural reasons) and my significant other goes and watches some matches from time to time, and he gave me 2 long plastic poles, balloon-like, that makes noise used for cheering... I mean most girls will go like, wtf??? but for me, it was like, OMG!!! it didn't matter that he got it for free, what mattered to me was that he remembered me during that second! <br>  And of course that made me sooo happy.<br>  <br>  I guess different girls like different stuff and you can't generralize us! <br>  Some like you and some don't. That's just the way it is. And each individual is unique.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|noX4xlvKaa	Well it depends what sort of girl it is. . . .could be a shy girl who just looks at you.

I think guys should look maybe a few times over at the girl but not be staring too much. I'm not sure I would like a portrait of myself unless I was close friends with the guy first, it comes off a bit too creepy. And giving the girl YOUR phone number puts you both in a weird situation because she may not like you and if she does like you, you may come off cocky like you know she will call you. <br>  <br>  I go for personality mostly but I have to be attracted to the person atleast a little bit to be with them. People who say looks dont matter are liars because you need to have some sort of attractiont to them or else you will lose interest real quickly.
CO7QiZbyaa	Well I have 2 opinions on this one<br>  <br>  1.) 13 is a bit too soon, you need to experience life with your friends and family before you start dating.<br>  <br>  2.) You need to talk to her, seriously I hate it when people are too chicken to talk to someone they like. It's not gonna kill you to ask her out or just even talk to her a bit. And if you think it might kill you, then you've got your eye on the wrong gal.<br>  <br>  P.S. DO NOT ASK HER OVER PHONE OR TEXT! That's probably the worst thing you could do and possibly ruin your rep for a while. Ask her in person, maybe have a friend walk you up to her. Something I do with my friends is I make a deal with them that if they truly like the person I will bother them everyday and bring them as close as possible to each other to lower the tension. <br>  <br>  P.P.S.

Marriage is for couples not friends.  Doing something like that for money is asking for trouble.  Is he going to sign a contract to guarantee money to you if you marry him?  That would also be illegal.  People do change their mind you know.  If he is in the navy, then he'll travel to foreign countries where he could meet other women and forget you.  The whole thing sounds like a bad idea.  Keep looking for a job and do your best.  Stay away from scams that could get you in trouble.  Even if it's only emotional trouble.  Good luck.

You will love yr kids no matter what, even whey they have played up and you had a bad day when tghey are asleep and you go check on them there is not a feeling like it and all is well in the world.

Some hormonal changes do not level out after birth either without help so Dr's visits are important for the state of mind health as much as the physical side.

If they are paying for and helping with the planning, then there is an argument for holding it in your hometown.<br>  <br>  I have to say, I'm having a hard enough time planning a wedding in my own city--I can't *imagine* trying to do this long-distance!<br>  <br>  Now, I hear your concern about how to handle the situation with your parents.  There's something about weddings that just brings out a lot of emotion in people, and causes extra problems within families.  I highly recommend that you talk to a professional counselor about finding ways to cope with the stress and deal with your family.  I have a highly disfunctional mother, and I could *never* have gone through my wedding plans without my therapist.  She has helped me strategize ways to present things to my parents without conflict, and handle my family's problems without them pulling me down with them.  My fiance has also played an active role in this (supporting me, helping me present a unified front to my family), and we have had a number of joint sessions together.<br>  <br>  To me, it sounds like there is something deeper going on with your parents, and the wedding is just bringing it to the surface.  Be strong, and I wish you the best.|`|4zPbqWB8aa	I believe that you answered your own question, it is your wedding and you just have to make a stand for yourself.

So what if you suck at first.|`|VV4XwDPdaa	This is a guide to basic kissing, i.e. you learn the basics and get the basics right, then experiment and try different styles and more advanced techniques.<br>  <br>  The basics<br>  <br>  1. Brush your teeth, get a good bath, nicely groomed and clean and fresh, before meeting the other person. There's nothing worse than kissing the rear end of a garbage truck<br>  <br>  2. Get into a comfortable position - you can't kiss if your back feels like it's gonna break. Suggestion - Sit side by side on a comfy sofa.<br>  <br>  3. Hold your lover , firmly but gently - don't cause pain. Suggestion would be to hold the shoulders, the neck or gently on the side of the face, one side or both sides.<br>  <br>  4. Move your faces closer. Don't bump noses. Suggestion would be the guy angle his face slightly so you don't bump noses.<br>  <br>  5. Kiss gently, normal closed lips kissing, and close your eyes. Closing your eyes increases the sensations you feel, and also sets the mood.<br>  <br>  6. Continue kissing gently. Get comfortable with simple closed lips, lip-to-lip kissing before going anywhere else.<br>  <br>  7. If fine till here, tentatively, slowly and lightly draw your tongue across the other person's lips.<br>  <br>  8. Chances are from here, if the other person lightly parts her tongue, slowly explore the other person's tongue in a light licking motion.<br>  <br>  9. The tongue has a very sensitive surface, which is why tongue to tongue is the essence of french kissing.<br>  <br>  10. After you've tried lightly licking the other person's tongue, you can try sucking on it, wrestling with it ( see if you can hold it to the floor of her mouth ) and other things like that.<br>  <br>  11. Explore the other areas of the mouth. Especially the roof of the mouth. Lightly lick, or tickle the area with your tongue.<br>  <br>  12. Don't bite. whatever you do, don't bite.<br>  <br>  13. Don't swing your tongue round and round like a windmill. Explore lightly, don't drill your way through.<br>  <br>  14. Breathe through your nose. Breathe through your nose. I say again, breathe through your nose.<br>  <br>  15. Follow so far? You can lightly use your hands too, lightly rubbing the other person. Suggestions, along the waist, along the back, the arms, especially the inside of the arm, the neck, maybe running your fingers through her hair. Again, don't cause pain.<br>  <br>  16. Continue kissing.|`|8WYFLp1Baa	The same way you french kiss a guy?<br>  hahahaaaaa, sorry. <br>  <br>  Anyways, no one can really tell you how it's done. Seriously, it just comes to you completely naturally. I was scared as hell the first time, but then it was just like, wow, this is easy. I've heard you can practice on a mirror, and by eating a banana without using your teeth, just your lips.<br>  <br>  At first it's really weird & mushy to, but you get used to it after awhile.<br>  <br>  Good luck. :)|`|wilZqg7Laa	Learn to Kiss with these 5 Random Tips<br>  <br>  1) Practice on your hand<br>  Sure, this might sound a little freakish, but everyone has done it, and it's a great way to practice your lip movement. Put your upper lip over you index finger (hand should be flat and facing you...like you're about to do a karate chop). Put your lower lip just below the bottom of your middle finger. Slowly glide your lower lip over the middle finger and stop<br>  when it gets to the bottom of your index finger (your two lips should come close but never touch).<br>  <br>  <br>  2) Practice in the mirror<br>  This is a great way to fine tune your approach. Watch for your facial expressions and look for two key things:<br>  <br>  the point at which you close your eyes and when you open your mouth. Wait until your lips are about an inch away (from the lips in the mirror) before you open up. At nearly the same time (or a half second earlier), start to close your eyes.<br>  <br>  3) Watch the Movies & TV<br>  It's hard to flip through the channels without seeing people making out...especially on MTV. Use this sex-saturated resource to your advantage. You can really learn a lot by watching people kiss on the big screen. Bear in mind, though, that not all kisses are realistic (Top Gun) or practical in everyday life.<br>  Instead, look at how normal kisses are done. Watch for body positioning, placement of hands, and the point at which people close their eyes and open their mouths. Rent a movie or two...this way you'll have the ability to hit rewind and watch the proper technique over and over.<br>  <br>  4) Watch other people<br>  Look at how couples at your school do it. Watch for details like the approach, the way they look at each other right before they kiss, etc.<br>  <br>  5) Ask your friends|`|pP5xDLkhaa	1. Moisten your lips. Dry lips do not move well together. Just a light brush of your tongue over your lips will be sufficient to moisten them. In general, use lip balm regularly- you never know when someone will go in for the smooch.<br>     2.<br>        Angle your head. If your mouths meet dead-on, your noses will get in the way, and you will not be able to kiss deeply or smoothly. To avoid this, tilt your head slightly to one side. Make sure you do not both tilt your heads to the same side.<br>     3. Close your eyes. As you approach for the kiss, look into your partner's eyes, but, once you are close to theirs, close your eyes. It can be a bit of a turnoff to be kissing and going cross-eyed. However, you don't need to always close your eyes; some people enjoy keeping their eyes open and seeing their partner when kissing.<br>     4.<br>        Start with a gentle and soft closed-mouth kiss. The French kiss is an open-mouth kiss, but do not lunge in with your lips agape like you're going to eat them; instead, open your lips very slowly. If you were learning to speak French, you would probably start with the basics, vocabulary and grammar, before trying to write poetry. Well, the French kiss is like the poetry of kissing, and before you can be good at it, you have to master the closed-mouth kiss. Even after you have added French kissing to your romantic repertoire, it is usually better to start a kiss with closed lips.<br>     5.<br>        Go Dutch on the decision to French. Kissing should be a shared decision. You need to have permission to French kiss someone, but when your lips are locked with theirs you may not want to stop and ask, "Hey, this is great, but can I put my tongue in your mouth?". Open your lips slowly and just a little during the kiss so that one of your lips is sandwiched between theirs and one of theirs is between yours. As you are locking and re-locking lips, brush your tongue against your partner's lips ever so slightly. This should make it clear that you want to French kiss. If your partner's tongue does not respond in like fashion or if they pull away, you will have to save the French kiss for another time when you are both ready.<br>     6.<br>        Explore with your tongue. If you and your partner seem to be enjoying the open-mouth kiss, slowly try to open your mouth a little bit more and gently push your tongue a little farther into their mouth. The tongue is very sensitive, and the mere act of touching your partner's tongue with your own will be very pleasant and stimulating for each of you. Do not stick your tongue too far into the mouth, as this can be a big turn-off. Instead, just gently and playfully touch tongues. As a guy, when you are starting to french kiss, touch your tongue to hers very lightly.If she wants more, she will come and get it.<br>     7. Go slow. Passionate kisses are good sometimes, but to really enjoy a French kiss, you must take it slow. Do not hurry and instead, take time to explore each other's mouths.<br>     8. Breathe. If you‚Äôre kissing for an extended period, it‚Äôs easy to forget to breathe. Believe it or not, gasping and turning blue is not romantic. Take small breaths through your nose as you kiss. You do not forget how to breathe! As you and your partner grow comfortable with the kiss, you can try breathing through your mouth a little: sharing breaths as well can be romantic (but not everybody likes it).<br>     9. Mix it up. Kisses are like snowflakes: no two are exactly the same. Once you finally feel comfortable French kissing someone, it is tempting to try to do the same thing every time. Add variety. Sometimes kiss deeper, for example, and other times pay more attention to the lips than the tongue. Hold the kiss longer or shorter and explore the art of kissing. When something feels good for each of you, do not abandon it for the sake of variety.<br>    10.<br>        Use your hands. While you should keep your hands polite, especially on a first kiss, you don‚Äôt necessarily want them just dangling at your sides. Embrace your partner, cup his or her face very gently in your hands, or run your hands through his or her hair. Another turn on for the first kiss is to gently caress their shoulder while you kiss. It shows you are comfortable with him/her. Gently hold your partner's face with your hands on their cheeks and their neck, or wrap your arms around your partner in an embrace. The most important thing about using your hands is that you respect your partner's boundaries. Play with their ears or run your fingers through their hair, as this is very stimulating. The second most important thing (much less important than the first) is that your hands should do something. Don't just let them hang at your sides; it will seem like you're not into the kiss.<br>    11.<br>        Be a gentleman (or a lady) at all times, and you'll be more kissable.<br>        Be a gentleman (or a lady) at all times, and you'll be more kissable.<br>        Read your partner's body language.

It seems as if he is just using you when and as he pleases! stop putting out and see how long it lasts, im sure it wont be for long!|`|7kF26l4jaa	sry to say this but hes just using you|`|aVvLmizqaa	Tell me do you understand the word commitment..I just say try to ignore him.If he will back he's all yours.If not never be your else you pick the all ways to attract him.Its all about mutual understanding and relationship.Best of luck and god bless.|`|hHndD5SEaa	I dont think you can - It sounds to me like he might allready have a girlfriend if hes not willing to introduce you to people - or have you round his house.... this is very suspect behaviour....<br>  xx|`|7b6d9b71ec244bad6e5e7cd334ec64e6aa	stop putting out at home and pester him for a date, if he doesn't bother continuing to see you after that then he just wanted you as a dirty little secret.|`|a017d5b848ff6918c2d2ad130e54c9c1aa	He doesn't take you out in pluble?<br>  He's using you.<br>  Dump him and find someone who treats you w/respect.|`|CrZxYK5raa	it can be weird for a guy.<br>  he does not want to commit because <br>  he does not no if you will change. talk  to <br>  him. <br>  about his family his parents might be really<br>  strict or unreasonable. talk to him and flirt around<br>  the topic of going to this restaurant. if he does not <br>  pick up the clues talk to him. he is a guy they think<br>  the world circles around them sometimes. be loving<br>  and show him that your the girl for him. <br>  best of luck.|`|y497a31Iaa	it sounds to me like he's making a point of doing the exact opposite.<br>  sorry hun but your being used as a convienience to him and its obvious he doesnt want you in that way
1JMNcVshaa	of course its ok..<br>   I‚Äôm taller than my guy n this don‚Äôt stop us making things together..|`|mDMnhqwdaa	Yeah, it's cool..i see it all the time.. it's up to you and if you like it.|`|nQix64Puaa	if its okay with YOU guys..<br>  me myself isnt tho|`|uv48B1Graa	It's not okay and it's not not okay. It's up to you and how you feel about it. Personally, I think height isn't that important in a relationship.<br>  <br>  You can't really choose who you fall in love with, and if that girl just happens to be taller than you, then oh well. Be happy that you found love :)|`|h5UqTSG3aa	looooooooool|`|qy07K2k5aa	Yes, it's OK.|`|DW5Eqc8vaa	Ofcourse its ok<br>  <br>  Just look up at her<br>  <br>  lol|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Of course! it's not her fault that she's taller nor is it your fault that you're shorter! Don't let a stupid couple of inches keep you away from a possible true love! Yes, some ignorants will make comments but once they see you're both comfortable with it, they'll stop. If you look uncomfortable and don't want to be seen walking next to her, they'll take the piss more. <br>  You know those celebrities are criticised and judged by everyone, it's Very tough and perfectionist in hollywood but many actors date and even got married to taller girls.. Tom cruise for example, he's been twice married to taller girls than him! <br>  You both can't help being of different heights, but why should you let that stop from giving yourselves a chance?|`|ymqRux3xaa	Tell "some people" to get a life.<br>  <br>  I'm 5'9" and I dated a girl that is 6' tall and much taller w/ heels. I called her my supermodel girlfriend. "Some people" were just jealous.|`|lhqM4qhxaa	it doesn't matter, as long as u r both happy, live life, tell the people they can go to hell !!!! lol, they are just jealous of you coz u got one and they dont get even smaller than them. lol|`|qtlzdtMVaa	So what if "people" say it isn't! If you like her and she likes you, what else matters? <br>  <br>  LOL! Silly boy...|`|SsAxq5z9aa	of course it's ok.<br>  if you both have feelings for each other and they're real; **** what anyone else thinks.|`|1jIzBUkhaa	yes it is, its not what you see, its how you fell towards each other that matter,|`|gWN7cZzmaa	as long as you have a giant penis.|`|8Loq9Skraa	Yeah, why not!|`|GEIsB7R6aa	of course it is! height shouldn't get in the way of you two spending time with each other. if you feel really uncomfortable with her being taller than you, then maybe you shouldn't, but don't let others prevent you from going out with a girl who is taller than you.|`|4USvZW6vaa	those people are crazy .. there is absolutely nothing wrong with dating a woman taller-shorter, chubbier-thinner, darker-lighter,..etc than U|`|iD39dv9eaa	Sure just wear boots and she has to wear flats and walk hunched, trust me no one will even notice.|`|5tBgGtzeaa	Absolutely yes|`|pykjTH4caa	lol why not|`|8i7AEWRCaa	why are u so lame? sure it is.<br>  oOo... it must be hard for her not you.

If it is any consolation, I got my first boyfriend at 19, and we are maried now, 10 years later!  Practice makes perfect with flirting, and lots of guys think a blush is irresistable!  Practice talking lots to guys you aren't remotely interested in.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	you are still young and the right guy will come to you soon. you don't have to rush into anything, just enjoy your life at the moment. i also understand your situation, im a bit shy girl myself. so what i did to overcome my shyness was, i always smile to people and whoever person that pass by me and i know them, i would say hi. eventually, all of them talk to me and i'm not that shy anymore. maybe just a lil bit. why don't you try it. hope this helps. good luck.|`|ydj487W2aa	I feel comfortable in front of guys for some reason. Im 13 and i have never had a serious bf either. If you think of them as a friend more then omg its a guy. You will probably be more embarrassed if you blush then if you act normal. Can't read my, can't read my, no he can't read my poker face.|`|cc9fd1e80d4f3f3e0531c81601acf1d6aa	No hurry dear. If you really want to find the right guy you're looking for impossible. It starts out with interest and attraction but in the end you guys have to make it work out. And you should be feeling empowered as a girl because you're the prize not the guy.|`|TWm5Smlaaa	just talk to them you would your friends, try not to think of them romantically, and you'll become alot more comfortable talking to cute boys.|`|5RH5hEq2aa	I'm going to be 12.<br>  I only had one boyfriend.<br>  and kissed to people.<br>  lol.<br>  <br>  but, yeah, idk<br>  flirt with guys? <br>  xD|`|QareyZKfaa	Just be yourself.  If the guys around you at the time can't get with you as you are, then you don't want them as boyfriends in the first place.  You will eventually meet someone who rocks your world and you will know.<br>  <br>  I can only stress that you remain yourself though... all too often people change themselves so that they can get someone else to like them.  It will fail every time if that happens.  So just be yourself and the right guy will come along eventually!|`|HRPOyReYaa	I'm 15, i've never had a girlfriend... and i couldn't happier.<br>  <br>  My older sister dated many boys throughout high school, she only ever had dramas with them... they are boys and us boys put our hands on any pretty girl that moves.<br>  <br>  I don't think many people actually have great relationships until they are out of school, alot of the time they only meet the person in their twenties. My sister has now met a boy, and im sure theyll get married, her first boyfriend outside of school btw.|`|fudV43hUaa	Don't worry too much about it. I'm turning 17, and I have never had a gf either.

JSruV3Wuaa	Mmmm........it's a difficult one this.  Difficult to answer honestly because it may cause offence or may just be something you don't want to hear.<br>  <br>  Perhaps you are not as attractive as the other girls.  This is obviously the first thing to consider because we are all attracted by looks at first.  The nonsense of 'it's what's on the inside that counts' is simply that: nonsense. <br>  <br>  Perhaps it's your English - grammar and spelling not looking good there Becky.<br>  <br>  What to do:  the main thing is not to give up.  Just keep looking and you'll find the right guy for you.  He may not be the most handsome fellow around, in fact he's likely NOT to be, but you'll know when you find him.  and then treat him well - don't give him cause to leave you or look for other girls.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|hHndD5SEaa	It sounds like youre not ready to get into another relatioinship - just be friends with this guy for now - see what develops of it - xx|`|1QiPrFyfaa	your on the rebound just wait a while you don't have to jump straight from being in a relationship straight into another one|`|dwhPolzbaa	def give it a go with this new person.<br>  just take it slow and don't get in to deep to fast, he might be completely different than your ex or anyone else so don't say no because you think you might get hurt, and if he does treat you badly then deal with when it comes along|`|nnsuWIVYaa	Sounds like your just starting to look out for yourself before a boy.  <br>  <br>  That is a great thing.<br>  <br>  <br>  take care of you.

2M2oLNFfaa	Hey,I'm 12 & my parents have been seperated for 3 yrs.me and my mom moved out.My parents promised to never divorce.They will stay together(in marriage) for me.They say they don't love each other anymore but both love me...I meet my father only once a month..As far as you are concerned,i suggest you tell them to sit together(the three of you) and tell them to listen.Say that you don't want THEIR fight to come in between YOUR life.Tell your mom she has no rights to stop you from meeting him(atleast once a month) and same for your dad from your mom. I just celebrated my birthday yesterday and they acted normal...ask them if they want to ruin your life..no na? then tell them they can hate each other but they HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE SO THEY DONT RUIN YOUR LIFE FOR 3 YRS (or more/less)..and if they DO get divorced(i pray not) then go to a mirror tell yourself,"Hey,I'm thirteen,God is with me,my frends are with me and so is are my relatives,I'm a big girl I can take care of myself.If this is how I deserve to live,then fine..i will..i can handle myself..obviously because I am.......(say good things to yourself)"<br>  Put your head high,walk and takl confedently..tell the world that "so what if I am living like this...Im brave,courageius and smart....I RULE ;P"<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Mail me at catgirl97@ymail.com incase you need some best-friend's-shoulder help :)|`|ZOakpNy7aa	Sometimes it is better for all even the children if a couple splits up rather than live together unhappy. I know it seems real bad, But when you see your Dad now ya its Dad great hi bye love ya. But when he moves out and you go with him its special time and its when you and Dad do things together. You might find that it will bring you closer than you ever thought possible. Just remember you don't ever have to pick a side. You are allowed to say to Dad and Mom "Your both my Parents I Love you both I did not ask for this separation so please help me handle it by letting me stay neutral." And is ok to hope and pray that they will work it out. Sometimes a little time apart is all a couple needs to realize what they had. Good luck sweetie.|`|hrZcz15Paa	I feel your pain, my dad moved out when I was 14 and my parents were officially divorced later that year. I cried myself to sleep every night for atleast a year. I would suggest talking openly to both your mom and your dad about it, whenever something is bothering you say it right then, don't just let it build up. I never told them what I was feeling about it I just kept it all inside and now, 6 years later I still have issues over it. So I would say communication is the most important thing to do. I am so sorry that you have to go through this because no matter what it sucks but you will make it through. goodluck and God Bless. I will keep you in my prayers.|`|IXskJPlVaa	Sorry for you dear - again sorry, there is little you can do about it. Try to keep yourself busy with other activities, friends and all. Also share your feelings with you parents especially your mom. It'll be difficult for all but the only your mom and dad have the answers. Take it easy and pray - for your parents to work out something - to make it a happy family once again. Best of luck.|`|YbSsCVRRaa	pray for the union of your parents. we are humans and should behave like humans. prepare for the least and the sincere prayer will help you all the best.|`|hYZIYla0aa	Sometimes parents do not realize that this is harder on the children then themselves.It is hard for you because you have always had both parents in your life.Sometimes relationships go bad and parents get tired of trying to keep things together,they see things differently as the years go on.Believe me they are hurting too.You are not alone in this my dear,My children have been through this also.Not that it is right for a child to suffer through such a heartbreaking situation ,but  sometimes it might be the best thing for them to do.they may be fighting non-stop and do not want you to see that.In time they will either fix it or they will learn to be friends.The best thing for you to do is tell both parents how you feel,they need to know what you are going through also.They must remember you are getting separated too.You can always talk to a school counselor,they can help you find ways to deal with this a little easier.It seems hard at 1st to deal with this,but you will be fine,it does get easier.Give it time,maybe they need a break to figure things out,but they may figure out that they are better off friends.The thing to do is to remind them that you are a part of this situation and need help getting through this ,just as much as they do.If not more than them.God Bless you my Dear.God will watch over you,when saying your prayers,ask God to make this easier for you,ask him for strength,and ask him to do what is right for you,Maybe the seperation will be what is best for you in the end.Somrtimes good things come out of something that may hurt you now,but may benefit you in the end.I am sorry for your sadness.It will turn out okay,one way or the other,give it time,God Bless.|`|hPV3hiMZaa	hey really very very sorry to hear this !!<br>  <br>  i hope you won't loose hopes!! only thing u can do is to pray to god bcoz this adults /elders can looose der temper anytime !! and don't listen to small ones !!<br>  <br>  sweety i am really sorry for u i really wish i could do something for u !!<br>  even i'll pray to god for ur safety !!<br>  it may happen that after bod of them admit their mistakes may b u get ur father and a sweet small family bak!!<br>  <br>  i wish for the best !!!<br>  <br>  hope it helpsss!<br>  take care!!<br>  don't take much emotional stress though i know it's not easy !!|`|8oKazGVGaa	im sure you would be more upset if you knew that your parents would only be staying together for you|`|5XYtvUUgaa	try incest
vRXtz76Iaa	This has happened to me many times and the conclusion and advice that I can give you is; Don‚Ä≤t sacrifice your happiness.. I know that you don‚Ä≤t want to hurt her, but u are hurting yourself... It seems like you felt PITY for her if you took her back if she was crying.. Don‚Ä≤t worry, it happened to me too like I said.. But you should think about yourself.. Talk with her, try and tell her with you don‚Ä≤t feel comfortable.. If you guys can‚Ä≤t work things out, IT MAY BE TIME TO MOVE ON OR U WILL NEVER BE HAPPY... Because if you argue everyday about little things or for no real reason, its never going to end good.. You‚Ä≤ll just end up hating to be with her and then that‚Ä≤s not a relationship, its a disaster.. What I did when this happened to me was try to tal it all out, but when she didn‚Ä≤t listen and went back to the same things before long; I BROKE IT OFF AND MOVED ON... Remember, you gotta pursue your happiness too... Being miserable in any relationship isn‚Ä≤t good... So do what you think is right and good luck man..|`|28d89d73cfa630ce9da9343770880c69aa	Depends, if there is more good than bad, then go for it. I think someone once said if you relationship is good at least 60% of the time. Then its a good relationship. If there is so much bad, and rarely it is good, then time to pack, and get to walking onto a different path.|`|ZvtNQTELaa	Maybe it is something deeper the reason you two cant get along.Step back and take a look in and the make a call of what to do|`|AA10720869	This is a scene i know all too well. ahaha. To shed some light on the situation. First of all, how do you feel about getting back with her? Regret? No emotion (Going with the flow) ? Or feeling good? I know that the whole crying scene would most likely trigger the "taking back" part, but what about after. And ask yourself why do you think you don't love her anymore? Another advice: In every relationship, you can't avoid hurt, you can't avoid arguments, you can't avoid yelling if what you want in the end is love. (wow, this is getting cheesy). Like they say, No Pain no Gain. If you want to build a stronger relationship, try working on discussing things rather than trying to force a story/point of view down each other's throats. Be open minded and ask one of another if they understand how it looks/sounds like in your situation and vice versa. I think the best thing you can do right now is give your girl a second shot. And approach each argument in a positive and new direction. And if that doesn't help, then you should reconsider why things aren't the same anymore. But for now, keep your head up and stay positive. Good Luck : )|`|azHXekQ3aa	You might want to say what you two are disagreeing about. If the arguments deal with core values, then it's probably best to go your separate ways. If you two can find sensible compromise within your disagreements, then try and stick it out... if that's what you really want.|`|ldqQDwI4aa	Tell her you don't want to be with her if you're always arguing! and that it won't work, People do disagree, But she might be ready to compromise, But you have to as well!|`|LLbOdAqjaa	Oh goodness my boyfriend is the same... he hates arguing and always wants chill conversations etc.<br>  <br>  <br>  What is normal is arguing/having a little fight every once in a while that happens in every relationship because if you care about it you are bound to have some disagreements because after all you are just wanting to make the relationship better.<br>  <br>  What you need and are probably dreading.. is a talk.<br>  communication is key<br>  <br>  KEY!!!!!<br>  :)<br>  <br>  Also, if she is being to demanding try to set boundaries and keep yourself busy and give each other space.. but don't ignore her completely but try to involve yourself in some kind of legitimate activity.<br>  <br>  ---<br>   Another thing.. sometimes you just need change.<br>  <br>  If you guys do the same thing every time you hang that's just boring..<br>  <br>  trying bonding acitivities.. cooking with each other, bike reading, playing video games, go to a bookstore together and find the erotica section and flid through books together. <br>  <br>  Doing these type of things will build your bond.<br>  <br>  Now to build trust.<br>  <br>  Confide something in her so she knows you trust her and are honest. it doesnt have to be a huge secret.. but just tell her something you havent before.<br>  <br>  Also..<br>  <br>  ask her what does she expect out  of the relationship.. and then tell her what you expect.<br>  I hope that helps!<br>  good luck!<br>  Keep a positive attitude :)<br>  <br>  last thing..<br>  <br>  if you have tried doing new activities, improving communication, talking etc. and can't see eye to eye.. then dude... it'll be hard but that time might just come :(
AA10199189	why does your family not have a budget that provides the housekeeping money and a share of the surplus to your mother?    so yr dad thinks your mom doesn't work?    let him do it for a week!    tell them to sit down and have all of you figure out a budget that everyone can live with - and no putting forward requests for stuff you don't need|`|7c7e7239a13fa3735f761565b7230571aa	Yes it is childish and meaningless to fight over such issues.  The money is ours and more so because your mother is a housewife/mom.  Everything dad brings home is for the family as a whole since there is no other income.  Your mom's contribution to the family is her care of all of you and the home.  They just need to keep it simple until you all grow up and move out of the home.  Then they may be able to tuck some away for themselves.|`|mzkfSwLwaa	Ahh i know that fight nothing you can do they will be fine a few days later.|`|ZAqlySc1aa	I think you shouldnt get involve on their problems, they' ll resolve it themselves. I think theirs nothing you can do...............|`|2bN8mFq2aa	Im sorry your going through this, but I think I would just tell your parents how it feels. Maybe get you and your siblings together and show them what they are doing and maybe they will get the point.
AA11100518	less social stigma  changing culture ie no longer thinking 'it's none of my business'  more programs on tv about child abuse  changing ideas of what constitutes child abuse  easier reporting such as 1-800 numbers  of course increased child abuse, but i doubt that.|`|MLdykhQNaa	Without doing tons of research I'd say awareness has been a major factor.  I know teachers ask their students if anything is happening at home now these days too.
SwojYmvdaa	Yes they are, in my personal opinion I think women who make the first move are very attractive, so long as they don't go overboard. However I think you're question maybe worded wrongly, there's a difference between being "forward" and making the first move, forward implies being promiscuous and has hints of desperation which in my opinion is not so attractive|`|IGhUA1Vdaa	I think some guys get board with always having to be the one to make the first move. So a girl doing it sometimes must be a relief.     There are guys that don't like it but that's ok. Lets us girls know how a guy feels when he knows there is a chance he can get rejected.|`|kl1kzlzXaa	Oh yes they are.. as long as they aren't obnoxious. I'm sure you know what an obnoxiously forward guy is like, so don't do that.|`|boIRASS7aa	I like the shy ones best.  We can get comfortable with each other before all the drama...|`|bcc9b2244c635c5b359d3c88d4d14878aa	Not a turn off.    There are lots of single guys out there just as shy as you.  It is nice when a women makes the first move.
c312b6829a6336dc220a6748d4450751aa	YES IT CAN!  Don't give up on your marriage.  When my husband and I got married we both agreed that divorce was not an option for us.  We have are ups and downs, but how we get through it is by going back to the blissful days.  We write down all the things that made us fall in love with each other and we give our lists to each other and read them together out loud.  Help him remember why he fell in love with you in the first place.  Re-create a special intimate moment you had, or have a date without the kids and pretend that this is your first date together.  Believe me this works, it really makes you feel the same way you did when your first started dating.  Only one rule, no kid talk.  Look at pictures together and talk about what you did and how you felt at that moment.  A marriage requires falling in love many times, but with the same person.  Now go get your spark back!   Best wishes to you both.|`|9PSEhEcPaa	60 percent of U.S. couples are divorced inside of 5 years. That's the highest rate of any country IN THE WORLD. Doesn't say much for our morals and values, does it/ Guess we need to reevaluate what we REALLY look for in a person.|`|OA3Mgsuaaa	Im sorry, you dont deserve this, nobody does.   You need to tell him that you feel your relationship is worth saving, and hope that he feels that way too. Have a long and frank conservation with him about why he thinks you lost "your way". If he doesnt want to try and save it, there is nothing you can do, other than make sure you have a very good attorney. Be prepared... it may not be that you two have lost the way, it may be he has "strayed off the path".|`|BUET39wmaa	you both have to be on board to fix it.  if not then it's doomed to fail.    if you are both on board then therapy works well.  if that isn't an option then you two need to perhaps have a pow wow.    my therapist recommended you sit back to back.  one person speaks about all things honestly what they want etc.  the other person cannot talk or respond until they are done.  then the second person does the same thing.  not addressing or defending what the first person had to say.    it helps because you don't see facial changes and you can't formulate a response while the other is talking so therefore you just listen.    Good luck!|`|t0uIgY08aa	men usually stick to their original decision. What I did was lost a bit of weight. Became more of an animal in bed, and let him know how hard life is without my income.

Think back to how it was before you get married.What did you guys do for fun? sometimes when people have kids and get comfortable they stop doing that ever it was that attracted the man to you in the first place. You have to make him fall in love with you all over again.|`|jo7knixpaa	Watch that Fireproof movie that just came out on DVD - really good stuff.  Also, read the book "Love and Respect" by Dr. Emerson (??)  really eye opening.  A lot of times, because men don't feel respected - in turn they don't feel loved.  All women know how to do naturally is show their love, as opposed to show respect.  It just doesn't come as easy/normal for women.    That book really opened my eyes to alot of things about men.  I know adding children to the mix changes things, but as long as the man knows he is respected (Even if you have to fib a little.... like say "you know, I can't quite figure out this DVD player - you know how to fix things, could you do it?" ... for some reason, they take that as a macho man thing and get excited that you need them!)     Good luck!|`|0AShsMsoaa	buy these three books.  relationship rescue by dr phil, divorce busting by michele weiner davis and the dr laura book proper care and feeding of husbands.     have you gained weight?  is the house a mess?  are you grumpy? do you complain?  if any of these is a yes, right this minute take that behavior off the table and when he sees you look your best and act very very happy.  cheerful.      dont bring up your problems again until you read those 3 books.      in this day of women being equal to men, i am all for it, in this case, try what i wrote above.|`|SZhqD0gaaa	Sounds like you two need to try and spice things up a bit...He probably feels like the spark is lost.Maybe the two of you should get a sitter for the kids and take a romantic weekend getaway.Even if you two just stayed home just take sometime for the two of you to be totally devoted to each other!|`|7ewzmiNEaa	Ask him how he thinks it can be better and the way it used to be.|`|9ae557afae8c72a2f03fc0f5b4f78564aa	Why would you want a man that doesn't love you anymore?

AA10199189	did you check the phone books?    for a proper search you should have:    your uncle's name  their parents' names    mom's name  date of marriage and divorce    then you can begin a search thru rootsweb.com    i quickly flipped thru the online white pages and found no william taylor rule in r.i. but he could be listed simply as "W" rule - see what you are up against?    116 Results matching "William T.

60FT7Pzcaa	The sad truth is that for some people, the only way to make themselves feel better is to put other people down and hurt them. This way, they can always feel like they are on top and in control of their life. Try talking to friends or other family members when you need to vent or talk about things. You may have to accept that for now, he is now being a father figure for you and there is nothing you can do or say to change that. It doesn't mean you are any less of a person or aren't important to him, he just doesn't have the capability of expressing that right now.|`|w3oVzM2Zaa	You should say to him what you wrote here.Next time he starts on you saying mean things to you.Say to him so what do you want me to do?.tell him that hes always picking on you & putting you sown & that he never says s/t nice to you.tell him he makes you feel bad.See how he reacts.If he reacts the way u think he will.It is not worth killing yourself over.

VSVQHKwKaa	Write him long emails.    It sounds a bit old fashioned, but it'll serve two purposes:    1. We think about what we write about (as opposed to say). It sticks in our heads. By writing him a long love letter every few days, you'll keep your marriage fresh in your mind....which I imagine is your goal here.    2. It'll let him know that you care. Don't expect terribly long responses...guys are all thumbs when it comes to poetry. But it'll be a calmer, less stressed, and less rushed way to convey your feelings and passions about him.    In fact, tell him to save them, and you'll redeem each one with a long night of romantic lovemaking when he comes home. That way, he'll pay very close attention and treasure them and miss you terribly.     Then, when he DOES come home, you two can read them in bed together and remember how hard it was to be apart. It'll make you feel even happier now that you're together.    Good Luck!|`|BUET39wmaa	mail him some of your panties.    write him a naughty letter    when he phones whisper something naughty to him so that nobody hears you|`|AA11016526	I always have us night once  a month candles, rose pedals, picnic lunch fruit& dip, cheese crackers nice hotel /w whirlpool. leave notes for each other. and the main thing communication like I tell my husband we can we do not have to agree on everything|`|5Wr9Mlwoaa	Speak to him on the phone, talk softly in a sensual voice, let your love flow from your heart.

pyWY5FcYaa	Get very clear about your feelings for her.  Love is a choice. You should be able to love her (in the sense of wanting to protect her and wanting what is best for her and your children) without having sex with her.

Check out the two sources below....|`|BUET39wmaa	man it's rough  but you can't be a rug either  be a man and stand up for yourself and don't let her walk all over you.    tell her you are done with the drama and hope the best for her.    nothing gets a girl more than thinking the guy doesn't pine after her anymore...  indifference is much more effective then fighting|`|95ad502b68bac9621967011bb0d65bf4aa	realize this: she's not who you think her to be. true love can't happen when emotions don't go both ways. there is a very special lady for you out there, and it will all work out. just keep the faith, enjoy life, and love will come.|`|ofCRTXw9aa	You can't just stop. :[ sorry    The most you could do is keep yourself distracted.  & get a job to get more money.|`|nSUHvlyaaa	i know you'd want to know she's safe, but she's not your fiancee anymore, so you should let her stay somewhere else cuz that's only killing you to see her... i'm sorry. but do you really want her back or you don't mind moving on, but it's only the money in your way?

Number two...Dont  let yourself go too far with the guy,your young,  hes older,some guys are creeps underneath it all  but he might not be[my ex wasn't] but regardless  if you really like him and you wanna see where  it goes.....as long as your morals are good  your heads on straight and you trust  your own judgment,you'll be fine.

p0ioXUM2aa	it would put your special friendship at risk so my advice is "no"|`|PliIXKdIaa	you sound really young so i would say no! if you were older i go for it cause you grow out of telling your best friend 'everything' and if your only young chances are your relationship won't last that long anyway.|`|CjMhllYNaa	wow..group sex sounds like fun but not sister watching brother getting a bj or hj so i say NO|`|XXbZAriNaa	wanking off your bf with his sister there would be gross so no no no
wTIvLkJSaa	Whatever you do, don't say "Because I'm a people person."|`|6t76bgS3aa	because I need money to pay for my whiskey and cigarettes|`|KX8oWwDzaa	The economy's real bad and I really need the job, I'm hard worker, dependable, and I work well with others.|`|52otNiElaa	I'm everything you've ever wanted.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Because I'd be able to spell.|`|UdoLcwm4aa	I can double your money.
5agXk9ldaa	well i got earing and my gf told me that she hates it so i dont put it <br>  not because i am a pussy but because one day i will also tell her i hate that and she will respect it.<br>  try to tell him if not, dont bother your self after a while he will find out that it is not something important|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Find a nice way to tell him.|`|Zf18VjlCaa	Yeah, I hate earrings on guys too. I can deal with one in each ear, but just having one ear done is blah to me. <br>  <br>  I made my husband takes his out for the wedding and then when he wasn't looking... i threw them out... he never asked where they went and didn't go buy new ones...|`|jYMlAN4Paa	That is basically an old wives tale about guys who have earrings are gay. Most of the guys I know (including my 70 year old father) have an earring or two. <br>  <br>  Do you like him? Is he good to you? If he's a great guy, then does having an earring really screw it all up for you? If it does, maybe you shouldn't be involved with him. Personally, it takes a lot more than an earring to get me to dump a guy. You could tell him how you feel but I'm afraid you might come off as petty or something...think about it and then do whatever you think is right for you.|`|SBXmPn9saa	He thinks its cool but you can tell him that it was not that cool for you letting him know.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	i hate them too. just tell him he looks gay.|`|ytGaDM7Haa	If you have a relationship where you can just talk about anything, then you could bring it up carefully. Otherwise, just get used to it, if that's all that bothers you you should count your blessings.|`|b1df7096f51a744e1eb5d0d2020fcaeeaa	Love him for who he is. Accept him for who he is. <br>  <br>  P/S... also accept his earring|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	just deal with it i guess if thats what makes him happy then o well<br>  you should stil lik him if not...the relationship wasnt going that far anyways|`|yt4RRTkpaa	Ask him who is he trying to impress? Because his girlfriend (you) is not impressed.|`|PDAVQU3Caa	just say you don't like it.|`|kynzqmWgaa	tell him you don't like it, he might just take it off.|`|CCqqTw6paa	buy him a nice one that wouldn't look so damn annoying|`|acrnYYweaa	accept him for who is, or wants to be in that case.
s8cZsSX0aa	Well, this is an easy one my friend. Lets start with the current GF. Let the current GF know that you are planning on changing your life, tell her what it entails, and then see where you still stand with her.<br>  <br>  Now to your 1st sick friend, the one you used to sing to. There is no harm in going to visit her and sing her a tune or two or three. Heck even tell her you used to have a crush on her. But just make sure you tell her about your current relationship. This way she will know you are just a friend . <br>  <br>  Now to Sick girl 2, Just because someone has a TUMOR, doesn't mean they have an early expiration date. It just means that she will need close monitoring and possibly treatments for the rest of her life. <br>  <br>  But definately the first thing to do is let the current GF know that you are changing, and see if she is going to like the change or end on fair terms.|`|D2g0XSLTaa	Eeny meenie miney mo|`|znvx2NMQaa	bigger boobs wins the race|`|yeKGxyXCaa	ummm...go out with the girl whos dying, I mean come on.|`|eVF7mhE9aa	Wow...well, find out if the second girl will take you for the changed man you are. If so, ask her out and then take her to sing with you to the girl with the mental breakdown. There will be no confusion there. Just a girl you care for having a hard time and the girl you're dating. Besides, do you really want to date someone who is having a mental breakdown?|`|eaPHafi6aa	Maybe you should stay friends with both girls<br>  Meanwhile you should go to sing to that<br>  girl and if she does try to get into a relationship let her know<br>  you just want to be friends. I dont think you should get yourself <br>  into any kind of commitment until your ready or have found the right <br>  girl to commit to and when you find her you Will know. <br>  <br>  Anywayss Sorry about the Tumor =/ <br>  thats sadd|`|IcXmZc6saa	sing her a song through which u can convey ur feelings about her and like this she will understand and will not ask for a commitment.so everything will be fine....then u can propose the second girl and live a happy life ever after|`|09zVUMBRaa	Little dreamer, that's my answer.  Oh well, you got here first...|`|ngew4AWSaa	With a cup.
R1ecMOO8aa	You can do anything but don't forget that you are a girl. The only capital of the girls are their structure of the body and beauty.  if you loss the capital, no one will respect you.  so, keep it this in your mind. i like friendships, but i will keep distance with them because of our future. keep in mind that your life should not end with fun.

Sometimes I do it just to quicken the pace up so he'll go faster :P Sometimes it works to my advantage! Oh and I once had a guy friend who would always beg me to give him a massage but he also wanted me to scratch his back as hard as I could, and when I'd do it the most awkward thing would happen..he'd get a *****. Lol, but yeah some guys are weird like that :P It's the same thing as guys/girls like being bitten, I know I sure do :P|`|am7Ykwqiaa	My husband is addicted to a back scratch before sleeping. He can't sleep without it. OMG its annoying, he adores it, he can't get enough, the longer my nails the better. I regret the day I ever first scratched his back :(|`|vRXtz76Iaa	Yes, it sounds like he means it in general though.. not just sex.. But many guys like those kinds of things, WITHIN REASON... Scratching intensifies sex for a guy if he likes it or it may just make him feel good.. It depends on the guy and on what you are doing..|`|gRsuXxkbaa	in the back area yes  !!!! thats a big turn on|`|Pqm3tMyMaa	We men love battle scars :)<br>  <br>  there is no greater joy then feeling the pain of a scratched up back after a night of sex during the morning after shower..|`|4OPHGSaSaa	almost every man i know loves being scratched gently, its a big turn on and gives goosebumps and can be funny
Mhiwiy3Vaa	i have the very same problem.. cept that i dont need to lose any weight, i need to put on a lil weight.<br>  <br>  i have a really low self esteem so very rarely let my bf see me naked. no matter how many times that he tells me that im perfect in everyway, i still very rarely let him see me naked! i cant help it! <br>  <br>  what i do is i look in the mirror and tell myself that i am beautiful just the way i am, that i dont need to change one bit to please anyone, not even the bf. <br>  <br>  i also listen to what my bf says and learn to take a compliment from him. <br>  <br>  i know, it may sound lame yes, but it seems to work :)<br>  <br>  hope i was any help! :)<br>  <br>  later.|`|OHfZFR31aa	He doesn't want a girl who is thinner than he is. If he did, he wouldn't be with you. Be confident with who you are. Working out releases endorphins and can help you feel better about yourself|`|wohGR1Nkaa	I have major body issues with myself like ex anorexic. <br>  and stuff so I pretty much hate my body.<br>  But just start of by taking off an item or clothing in front of him and look at his expression as he is doing this and move towards him and kiss him.. Maybe if you close your eyes while taking the clothing off you will get more confidence. Make sure that when you take something off he shows how much he likes it about you.<br>  And then after that just start by getting used to the factor that someone you love likes your body..<br>  Try moving his hands down your waist so he can feel your curves.. <br>  Hope I helped. I do this all the time. =)|`|eNEgKxfJaa	im in a relationship with a really skinny boy for the last three years... im fat... hes super skinny lol<br>  <br>  but trust what your bf says... he loves you... he loves everything about you...<br>   <br>  i walk past my bf in my underwear and he says "sexy"... i find it hard to believe... but listen to his tone and look into his eyes... they mean it. they really do.<br>  <br>  i am also in the process of losing weight and if im ever thinner than my bf i will be past anorexic... seriously... lol but remember - they were attracted to us from the beginning... <br>  <br>  i am also self conscious about my body... but he loves me for my personality therefore my body is attractive and appealing...|`|pP5xDLkhaa	well heres the thing..if you love him u wouldnt feel uncomfortable with him looking at your body he shouldnt either if he does really love you..|`|0fwQcC50aa	OMG I'm 6'0 and use to weight 200lbs!<br>  I'm about 160 now and I get hit on all the time<br>  My soon to be boyfriend...we're both interested just timing... likes me but I'm so scared that he'll want me to show my body and I'm extremely self conscience about my body too, when a guy hugs me I feel like he's just grabbing my fat. I hate it! Oh and he's twig thin too... I'm extremely self confident though when I look in the mirror by myself but I know if someone was there I'd QUICKLY put a shirt and pants on! ANYWAY! He's saying your beautiful and he most likely wouldn't be with you if he didn't so every time you know you're going to take it off just remember HE IS WITH YOU! He wouldn't lie.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped...<br>  You're the first girl I've heard on here thats just like me (body-wise)!|`|iCqfmRC3aa	Ok Girls, I've been reading all the answers too, we need a little group therapy.<br>  <br>  Here's what we are going to do ... Everybody needs to find a clothing optional beach or resort near you ... wait don't panic, I'm not telling you to take YOUR clothes off.  <br>  <br>  What I am suggesting is that you put on your most comfortable clothes, whatever they are, then go to the clothing optional place .. beach or resort and take a tour of the place.  If it is a resort, they will either take you around or let you do a "self tour" .. fine whichever.  If it is a beach, you are on your own, just take a walk.  <br>  <br>  Don't worry about the naked people, they don't care if you look.  Just don't stand there with your mouth hanging open and gasp. ..<br>  <br>  Believe me, once you have been there a few minutes, you will start feeling better about yourself ... not because people there will look worse or better, but because you will see how much they DON"T care if they are not perfect, and let's face it, none of us come close to being perfect. <br>  <br>  I've been to many, many nudist beaches and resorts and MAYBE 1% of the people I've seen ... male, female, old, young, look really, really good.  But they all look fine, and they all look happy, because they do not have body issues. They put their worries away and you get to love them for who they are ... wow what a unique idea.<br>  <br>  If you are too young to go to a clothing optional resort on your own, then try to find a nude beach in your area ... almost every state has skinny-dipping places that are officially or unofficially sanctioned.<br>  <br>  Ok, there you go, Melissa and everybody else reading this has their instructions, believe me it will be something you'll look back on with favor, so go find a nudie place where you can stay dressed and take a good, hard look at other peoples bodies.  Then be happy with the one you have, or for those of you redesigning your body type, with the one you will have.  But, mainly relax and enjoy your life, your love and the time you have on this world, its too short for needless worry and its too much fun to get naked in the sun.|`|WbnAlLMeaa	um, i know exactly where you're coming from and sad to say, i never got over it.  however, i have been with the same guy for almost ten years and so he knows what's up and he's fine with it.  he doesn't push it and he doesn't question it.  he knows it's more about me than it is him.  unless you yourself are comfortable with your body, you can't expect anyone else to be.

eVF7mhE9aa	You could either poison the dog (that's not a serious answer) or you could buy her a new dog and tell her that its upsetting you to see her still having contact with her ex. How can she start a new relationship when she still has some connection with another? A dog is not like a child and the people you love should always be put before a dog. She has to realize that what she'll gain is far more valuable than what she is losing.|`|0M1Ovlodaa	well seeing that she was with the guy for 6 years might b hard to believe that she was over him in just a couple of months.<br>  <br>  u might b the rebound guy<br>  <br>  and the dog might just be a reason to keep seeing eachother.|`|kzxYoqiUaa	honestly if you make it an issue then it will be. as long as the interactions are non-intimate then you shouldnt have reason to worry. if you suspect something is going on the say something,|`|7YviD5tvaa	Your a DRAMA KING! I would feel insecure if my bf's ex girl showed up every 2 minutes. lol..thts awkward, they may one time just get over past hard times and just end up *********** u over.. haha. nah, you have to build trust with your girl and if you want this to work out than drop the T bomb before the L bomb gets in the picture. Don't let her play you for a dummy too. Woooooohooooooo we share a dog. If i were you, i'd get her a dog and see if she will still share that puppy with him. EXCUSE MAYBE BUT THATS MY BABY bLLBALBALa all that crap. You tell her, this can be our baby if you want it to be and see her reactions..hmmm.. ok good luck and dont ***** over thats not right, Maybe thats why you will get ***** over for hurting previous girls ha? so anyways take care and do as i say...trust me u'll get ur answer.|`|BMMdRtJMaa	If they haven't gotten back together in 8 months, then they're not going to get back together now. Eight months is a long time to get over someone -she IS over him. No need to feel insecure.|`|Zj9pycyUaa	just straight up the next time you see him knock his a** out be like dont come here no more lol jk i would get used to it and just make sure to watch there reaction to eachother|`|IcXmZc6saa	their are many other people with this same condition.dont worry...there is nothing between them...they are just good frends.|`|OHfZFR31aa	Sometimes people do remain friends with their exes, and that's all it is - friendship. If you have no reason to suspect she is cheating, then don't worry about it. They do have a dog together, which for some couples is like having a kid. A friend and her ex bf share a dog as welll and can be civil to each other, but there is NO WAY they would ever get back together|`|UrE9xvliaa	one of the biggest parts of a relationship is trust...i know its hard to trust people when u have been hurt and feel insecure...but if u don't have trust u really don't have anything..if this situation is really bothering u just be honest with her and tell her how u are feeling..u deserve to know...its not fair to u if she does have feelings for this guy and isn't completely over him...and if she doesn't and u really do like her trust that what she is saying is true...when u are in a relationship u have to take some risks if u truly want to be with that person..but if she does hurt don't take it personal..learn from it and move on...and don't let it contribute to ur insecurities..u will find someone who is right for u..sometimes u have to date a few "bad" ones before u find the one who is right for u..

You've already seen the red flags... she lied to you and you're frustrated. You said she slept around because she wasn't getting the attention she wanted from her ex bf. So, what's going to happen when you hit a rough patch in your relationship? Will she cheat to make you jealous? Probably. She has issues and she's not the right girl for you.|`|JhvW9jFRaa	Very simple...dump her and find someone honest and trustworthy..<br>  <br>  The longer you spend with her the longer you will be miserable and the more she will lie to you and for heavens sake do not have a baby with this person.|`|ZP4OdQGDaa	No You should definitely leave her, no matter how much you love her she has lied to you before, she is not worth it if she has been that unfaithful x|`|CgaQHgZLaa	Hell no!<br>  <br>  Why would a baby change her ways?<br>  Sounds to me like shes a compulsive lier!

cj8iM1Olaa	Survival instincts.|`|SBXmPn9saa	girls too but most boys are cheaters..|`|vRXtz76Iaa	NOT ALL GUYS ARE CHEATERS... It varies from guy to guy.. Nobody is the same and not everyone cheats..

Cheaters aren‚Ä≤t always easy to find, but that‚Ä≤s y girls should becareful and know the guys.. Not jump to conclusions and THINK that all of us are cheaters.. I have never cheated on anyone in my life and I‚Ä≤m a guy... BUT TO ANSWER THE QUESTION DIRECTLY...  Some guys ae very good liers, which can also make them GREAT CHEATERS... Honest guys can‚Ä≤t do it, if they do, they weren‚Ä≤t honest to begin with..|`|eVF7mhE9aa	Girls are great too.

zvvzcLdIaa	i was listening to a program on t.v and they said:<br>  <br>  guys under 30 are more sexually active then females of the same age but of couse that differs between persons but in general.<br>  <br>  guys over 30 are less active then females of the same age.|`|gRsuXxkbaa	actually - women are more sexually active given that they mature faster than men   - however on the flip side  - a woman reaches her sexual peak @ ages 35  - 43 while men reach theirs @ ages 18 - 23  which is why we see the dawn of the urban cougars  - the sex drives match up at these points  - but females are more sexually active because sex starts mentally mostly for women therefore women can literally think themselves into climaxes while men NEED physicality to achieve climax<br>  <br>  edit: <br>  JoJo  - have u  been scorned?|`|gh6NVRrjaa	it depends on the individuals gene.|`|UTxt6tOGaa	depends really.

When you're around girl's don't be shy, get close and touchy, look them in the eyes, do not look away, ( this makes them think you are timid ) <br>  <br>  2. Once you're in the dating period... don't bring the girls to some cheap restaurant.. that never falls on them.. bring her to a nice expensive restaurant with great food .. and that's when u can get romantic with her ^^<br>  <br>  3. The kiss - while talking, there is a certain time when u both click romantically, and you know it's the time to go in,,.. remember do not RUSH!, Slowly go in, and let the girl kiss you 1st, do not kiss her, let her kiss you, and there you are mr.wonderful :D<br>  <br>  Well that's about it in romance :D , thats how i hooked up with my sexy gal :D <br>  <br>  Good luck !!|`|QFf9phAmaa	as at this tender age oh just 15 i wonder how you ask this|`|7kF26l4jaa	be yourself and go with it<br>  live life<br>  you only live once<br>  remember those things and you will go far<br>  goodluck|`|OWqz9EuFaa	to young for that sh!t.|`|hrXNXW7Caa	strap up|`|am7Ykwqiaa	My tip: you're too young to be thinking about sex.

Do you think he would want you to kill yourself? That is just pointless. If I died and my lover would kill herself, I would ask this: "Why? Why did you do it? I always wanted you to be happy no matter what. I am disappointed."<br>  This is a rare occasion when I actually recommend group therapy and the help of a professional.<br>  <br>  Remember: if you die, you will only hurt those left behind(family, friends) the same way you got hurt by your lover's death.|`|5e8daa37473dedc0b408721b969ddd72aa	dont worry take cheese before sleep, u will get dreams and u may fullfill your wishes in subconscious mind in dream.

I've been in her situation before. She cares for you, but she doesn't view you as "the one". She doesn't know how to break the news to you because she doesn't want to hurt you. She's probably also torn... <br>  <br>  I'm sure she loves you, but it sounds to me like she's just biding time until that perfect man comes along. You're Mr. Right Now, not Mr. Right.

If you get back with him for a SIXTH time, you're just BEGGING for a horrendous love life. You obviously have low self esteem, or you wouldn't be putting yourself into such unhealthy, miserable situations. You certainly do have your whole life ahead of you...and there are millions of guys in the world. Logically, mathematically speaking, the odds are in your favor to meet several that you will find interesting and/or treat you amazingly. You just have to get past this one very bad hump in your life. Just think of the potential for romantic, story-book love affairs you have waiting in your future... go watch a Jane Austen-based movie like Pride and Prejudice or something... make yourself swoon over some Prince Charming from poems and whatnot.... just stop settling for such a horrible human being, and putting yourself through hell.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|x87Y6akMaa	You will love again .. anyway .. is it what you had with him what we call LOVE .. it seem to me that he did not love you .. he cheated on you 5 times !!!!!!!!!

I been there  myself .. well it takes long time to recover from being treated badly... you loose trust .. and it is very hard to trust somebody again .. love is about trust ... without this there is no relationship .. based on love it is rather a strange one coming from your own self devaluation. Allowing somebody to treat you badly under the name of LOVE is not LOVE ..|`|2W90OirZaa	YES I KNOW EXACTLY HOW YOU FEEL! MY BOYFRIEND AND I WERE GOING OUT FOR 3 MONTHS.

I DIDN'T EAT FOR 5 DAYS STRAIT! AND LATE AT NIGHT WHEN I WOULD BE SLEEPING I WOULD HAVE DREAMS ABOUT HIM LIKE NOT BAD DREAMS BUT DREAMS THAT HIM AND I WERE HAVIN A REALLY GOOD TIME. AFTER THOSE 5 DAYS WENT BY HE CALLED ME AND WANTED TO TAKE ME BACK! NOW AT FIRST I WAS LIKE O YES THANK YOU GOD! BUT THEN BEFORE I SAID ANYTHING REALIZED THAT HE WAS ONLY ABOUT SEX HE DIDN'T LOVE ME IF HE DID THEN HE WOULDN'T HAVE CHEATED ON ME! AND THEN DUMPED ME WHEN I FOUND OUT ABOUT IT. I KNOW THAT IT SEEMS REALLY REALLY HARD AT FIRST BUT WHEN YOU JUST SIT DOWN TAKE A DEEP BREATH AND THEN REALIZE THAT YOU CAN DO BETTER! HE NEEDS YOU  YOU DON'T NEED HIM! SO JUST TAKE SOME TIME AND THINK DO YOU DESERVE HIM OR DO YOU DESERVE BETTER|`|QU37MZi7aa	absolutely YES. though some matters time on when to fall in love again. and also, it depends on who is coming in front of you. just have more precautions to yourself as you will still face the same problem in the future (perhaps). though it's a lesson that you had learned.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	Yes, you can but after each time you have your heart broke it gets harder. You get jaded after a while.  Young people often rush in to a serious relationship way before there or there partner can handle it . This is why i believe  serious relationships and sex  should be entered into very carefully. As they can be life changing.. and scar a person for life.  Women often come out on the short side of it more often. With pregnancy being a dagger that can end a career or life's dreams. Guys just move on  never look back  most of the time. As it is in there nature . Get with as many women as they can. Only a few guys understand the seriousness of a relationship and sex..  So when you get one of these guys .. it is a rear find.. hold on to him if you can.  but should also know when to let go so your life can move forward if causes pain and hurt in your life. pain and hurt can cloud other decisions in your life and that to can cause even greater pain. Some things are just not meant to be .Your parents and friends  are right .. listen to them.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I have fallen in love again after a devastating heartbreak so I believe that it is possible.

6k8GJBRPaa	Personally, I wouldn't mind, because the result of a strength test shouldn't be part of the relationship. And if you like to do fitness, that would be OK for me... <br>  I would mind when all your freetime would be spend in gym (and not at home), because then there's not a real relationship anymore.

The fact if your in your 20's  and you have not has sex. That says your smart and focused on something besides getting laid or parting.  That is someone you could build a future with. To handle the pear pressure of having sex and did not falter . That would give me good reason to believe you could handle the hard work it takes to make a good relationship work. as well as make wise decisions for a secure future .  having sex when your in your teens only shows you not ready and can't handle a serious relationship. Most of the time it will lead to trouble.

KVFYJrDJaa	Well, cute is one thing and pretty another. Cute is like adorable, like a baby or a little kid. Cute is also Willow from Buffy, who gets pretty when she puts on some makeup and vamps it up. Pretty is like Anne Hathaway who is pretty, but kind of rides that line between pretty and hot. Pretty is Audrey Hepburn and young Isabella Rossellini or Ingrid Bergman - classic beauty. <br>  <br>  But Pretty and Hot are also two different things. But you can be pretty but not hot, but you CAN be cute AND hot. <br>  <br>  Without seeing you with my own two eyes, it's impossible to give you my opinion. HOWEVER, if you think you're pretty then that's all that matters. You are the only person you need to impress when you look in the mirror. But, if you want a good comparison, sit down and watch a few episodes of Jerry Springer and Maury. If you look like any of the monstrous trainwrecks that go on that show and spew unbelievable rhetoric about how great they look and how everyone wants them and they can have any man they want, you might want to reconsider your opinion, because that's the picture of delusion. <br>  <br>  I wish you all the best!

MFdnDC75aa	You are young for this and I'm so sorry for you and your family.<br>  My best advice is she is gone but her memory lives though you.She would want for you to go on and be happy. You can volunteer with an organization that works with sick children in honor of your sister.|`|zQB0kEmcaa	That is a sad story and I am so sorry.  Unfortunately death is a reality and sooner or later you will come face to face with it ( like now).  These early days after her passing will be touch but it's true when they say the pain gets a little easier with each day.  It's hard for everyone in the family but you must all pull together now at this difficult time and help each other.  Talk with your family about your sister and the good times you had and the funny things she did - that will help.  Maybe even cry all together to get the pain out a little.  You live in a great place so go for some good long walks - it will help.  Listen to music as you go and just let your thoughts go wild ....  You will work through this, you'll see.  A big hug to you and your family....|`|eiJOdPgxaa	I'm so sorry.<br>  <br>  Try contacting Cruise - ask at your local doctors surgery for their number.  Also talk to your family - you are all in the same terrible position.  And don't block out your friends either - they can help.|`|AA11066099	Hiya,<br>  Not sure if wot I say is going to help you but I am going to try anyway.I have lost a lot of people through very different circumstances in my life and the worst loss of all was losing my boyfriend who committed suicide 3 years ago,I imagine your whole family is all lost in their own grief at the moment and handling it different ways with no one being able to see any future beyond the loss of your sister,but you will day by day come out of the black hole that grief puts you in.You will never get over losing her but slowly your family will begin to support each other as opposed to being alone in your loss,at the moment its probably taking all your strength just to get through the day.You have to give it time and please don't ever give up on your own life all of these tragedies only make us stronger for the future,I know that now.You are 15 with the world at your feet and your sister would only want the best out of life for you.I found inner peace from practising Thai Boxing and Kung Fu and Yoga,you have a long road ahead of you but life cannot get any worse from now on for you because the loss of a child is the  hardest it gets.Maybe look into counselling,I never had any but I know people who have and relied upon it to get through losing someone they loved.<br>  Stay strong kid.Thinking of you.x<br>  Nicky (scotland rd)anything I can do to help just message me lad.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	I am so sorry.   I cannot fathom what you are going through.   I have lost a best friend once, but I don't know how that compares to a family member.   Time is the only thing that will allow you to heal.   You just have to do the best that you can right now.   I will say though, I know a book called The Shack that has helped other people I know who went through a similar situation of losing a loved one.   You may want to read it.   Good luck.   It will get better.   Just give it some time.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Im very very sorry for your loss hun - loosing someone that young must be heart wrenching.<br>  But look - shes at peace now - shes looking over you and will always be with you in spirit.<br>  I know it hurts and youre upset now - but you'll get through it - your family need your support right now - help each other through this tragic loss<br>  xx|`|Vh7SYMACaa	Firstly, I am truely so sorry for the loss of your sister and I wish you and your family the best of luck in the future.<br>  <br>  I went through a very similar situation a few years ago when my sister, who was two and a half years old died of a heart problem. I also, adored her and in the following years I have to admit that getting over her death was so hard. That isnt to say however, that it hasnt made me a better person, it has and although its really hard to realise it now, your sister would have wanted you to move on eventually.<br>  <br>  What I found tha hardest thing to get into my head wasnt the fact that she was gone, but that I didnt know why she deserved to go or why we deserved to lose her. This took me ages to get over and I'm still not sure if I have done because I have never really understood why my sister was the one to go when there is so many other people who could've gone.<br>  <br>  As for trying to move on and life your life, I am sure that eventually you WILL be able to. I know that now you will feel down, depressed, gutted and greifing but once you have some time to greive on your own you will understand that your sister would have wanted you to be the best you could possibly be and she would have wanted you to do as much of it as possible with a smile on your face. Even if you dont feel like you want to go forward in the future, do it for your sister and your family.<br>  <br>  When it comes to actual physical remedies for greif, I have to admit that their arent any. The only couple of things that I can advise you to do are to firstly try and see a child bereavment councillor. These people are really good at just sitting down with you and letting you pour your heart out to them. It helps. Trust me. The only other thing that I think that is helpful is that when you feel angry, stressed, and annoyed with life overall try not to take it out on family and friends. Use a pillow as a punchbag or go for a run. <br>  <br>  I really hope that you and your family get through these difficult times but I can tell that you will be a strong person and that there will be light at the end of the tunnel.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|f89f116400d4ff9b53b246c33e1753cdaa	Unfortunately my friend - there is nothing we can say that will make this go away.<br>  <br>  What you need is help and counselling - and good all round family support - give and take the support to your and from your family.<br>  <br>  Consider also the important thing here - she is not suffering anymore and although this sounds like little comfort - you know I am right!<br>  <br>  Go to your Doctor and ask him for his advice and help - he (or the surgery nurse) can put you in touch with support helpers and volunteers (many of whom will have gone thru this) and can support both you and your family - you do not need permisson form your parents - you can do this on your own if you need to.<br>  <br>  Please - if you never listen to another adult in your life - take on board what I have said - get help - it is out there.|`|ajOlzSJ1aa	You will have to go through the whole grieving process. It will be difficult and I am sure you will go through a whole range of emotions, but one day you will realise you feel better, stronger and able to move on with your life.<br>  The best thing is for you to talk about this, with family, friends,hospital staff, or a trained counsellor.|`|wzGSdBHsaa	I am so sorry to hear about your little sister. Give it time it's too early now as you are grieving,but in a while you will feel slightly better, like your sister would of wanted you to. Live for her and enjoy all the things that she would have. I know it's soo hard right now, but it will get easier.<br>  Take care!|`|6jW5L3Vqaa	I'm really sorry to hear that ;/<br>  <br>  Like one of the answers above said though, you and your family need to help each other through this, and you have to be strong for each other<br>  <br>  If you ever feel you need to talk to somebody but there is nobody, there are always help-lines out there, or you could talk to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Sorry again for your loss..|`|QdnH6oyMaa	well a kid so small fought for 6 months... that should inspire you to do something with your life.. find your courage in the Lord.. . accept his will... and live life for the both you....<br>  <br>  sorry about the loss.. it does hurt now.. but you will find strength after you have grieved|`|znvx2NMQaa	it is natural to grieve the loss of your sister and my condolences.<br>  <br>  your little sister would want you to be strong and life a happy life and make your own little ones in the future.<br>  <br>  stay strong mate.|`|mNqNqKrIaa	you'll just have to get over it. live your life for her. she wouldn't want her big sister like this right?|`|Zca1PGERaa	im very sorry to hear this this is such tragic news. My thoughts to you and your family x|`|u3Fnrvk3aa	Firstly, i really really sorry about your little sister.<br>  Alls you can really do is focus on what you have now, be there for your mum and dad who are also going through alot of the same feelings.. talk to them and just remember she will be watching over you, she wont want you to be unhappy so live for her, maybe keep one of her toys or teddies in your room just for the sake of it.<br>  Try taking your mind of it by doing something you enjoy, i dont mean that in a nasty way but just to give you some time to think about stuff.<br>  Good luck with everything!<br>  <br>  xx|`|1IYtsxsOaa	there are several organisations you can get in touch with such as child line, nspcc and barnardos or you can talk to your gp. remember if you want to talk to someone dont be scared to and make sure you pick someone you can trust.

Their loss!|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	My Girlfriend (35 in May) & I (23 in just under 3 weeks) also had a similar problem (we're also co-workers). People who we thought were our friends were only trying to discourage us from being together & separate us by spreading rumors (which they thought was very funny at the time). When I had found out, I told my Girlfriend everything.<br>  <br>  We proved them wrong & we have broken all contact with them (why did we even bother entertaining people like that when the rest of the world smiles & even compliments us when they see us together - which is almost everyday. They even ask us how we pulled it off).|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i hate it when friends do that; because you should be able to trust the most important people to you. just let your friend have him. he obviously wasn't worth it in the first place, the same as her. if you care enough about your friendship with her then just pretend you don't care at all; and carry on :) i don't find it funny either to be honest. be careful who you think you can trust these days :)|`|vY0ScgeXaa	There are all kinds of jerks, bullies in this world.<br>  <br>  just make sure to stay with kind people. the jerks usually dont get punished becoz their crimes are mostly misdemeanor. but you never know, one day they ****** up, they go to jail. they can't be lucky always.<br>  <br>  when you become an adult, make sure you run your civil right to get a legal weapon, and if someone dares to intrude your home and threaten your life, give it a shot, get rid of the bastards.|`|EgUxu5kjaa	you're such a loyal friend!<br>  yes, you dont deserve to be treated like that..<br>  if i was you..<br>  i'd definitely find a new group!<br>  :) who needs friends like them?!|`|zKyy1gE2aa	When things like that happen, you realize who your true friends are.

And that could destroy how you feel about any future husband in your life. Trust is so easy to harm/kill.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	Ask him.<br>  <br>  Just be honest with him. You were afraid and that drove you a little nuts. It's normal. It's a normal thing to do if you are insecure in your relationships. <br>  <br>  He might have been tired but you kept calling so that pissed him off. He wasn't defensive, he was just upset that you wouldn't respect him by just calling once and leaving a message.<br>  <br>  The sooner we all are honest with each other in our relationships and realize that we are all human and stop expecting perfection, the sooner relationships won't be such a complicated fiasco.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	He's taking you for a ride.|`|c5UAa65qaa	He's your ex.  Unless you have an agreement in place that you're both not going to sleep with anyone else right now, it isn't really your business whether he was with someone or not.
YBQvzEhGaa	Okay I am no means chunky or chubby but my husband once confessed to me that he once had a desire to have sex with a big girl because they look soft.  He said it would seem like laying on a bed of warm soft skin.  Ummm....anyway that's his fantasy not mine.|`|XsmPnMU4aa	I like the love handles and the big butts. <br>  <br>  Not sure what it is but the chubby girls just make me hot. <br>  <br>  I would recommend 3 gallons of ben and jerrys a day for 3 months and you should be big enough. <br>  <br>  When you get chubby let me know.|`|lXE75yQjaa	I have no idea..but I'm in!! If I could eat Ben and Jerrys all day..WOOT! That would be better than sex really! Lemme know when you find out Ellie.<br>  <br>  Edit: I am ROFLMAO at boysrus..that is TOO funny! lol|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	They're so soft and cuddly :-D|`|jEU9wcr1aa	I like big men but i couldn't tell you why. I have been with smaller men  and they don't attract me at all physically. But if i were to find a small man i wouldn't rule him out because he is skinny, personality is whats most important. so don't go gaining weight for someone. if he hasn't made a move on you yet its there is no saying that he will when you are bigger.just let your personality shine|`|12gvcc2Daa	its not wise to invest all your energy's into one person. becoming chubby just for one guy hardly seems worth it. and most men who prefer big girls don't actually prefer big girls there just more into the persona of the girl, and most girls with good personalities are in fact a bit chubbier...|`|1os95dHZaa	Well I am a chubster myself. I can tell you just sitting on you rump right here in front of your computer will do it for ya! You don't even need to change your eating habits unless of course your a vegetarian then you need to add some red meat preferably steak. (well done burnt, can you make me one too?)|`|LbqIo9H8aa	dude don't change just for him if he really likes u he'll like u as u are sorry i know this didn't answer ur question|`|Kl1h5dCaaa	WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT??<br>  <br>  A MAN???<br>  \|`|xXnFx6qLaa	Just make sure you have some junk in your trunk.  Nothin worse than a big girl with a flat arrse.  <br>  <br>  I'd prescribe 15 pints of B&J a day for two weeks.|`|vKYdV5r2aa	I like a girl with a little meat on her bones , I 'm not exactly a chubby chaser but any girl under 180 lbs is fine with me ! <br>  I don't care for the skinny twig type , i'm always afriad i 'm going to break them !!!!!!!!!!!!!
BzUMSGgwaa	To be honest I think broken promise is a lot worse. People lie to get themselves out of trouble or to make someone feel better-its only human. Breaking a promise is a lot more serious, its complete betrayal, and you should never be trusted again. I have never broken a promise to anyone. x|`|482e02ed9008d4730d65a08467cdf9d6aa	a lie is something you say to get yourself out of trouble, or make yourself look good, a promise is an obligation you had to do or say and you didnt breaking a promise hurts more than a lie sometimes|`|AA10098126	Past and present tense. A lie is being untrue about something you DID, a broken promise is being untrue about something you WILL DO.
nE95Hnn5aa	Okay, if you divorced your husband for something other than adultery/fornication, then you had sex with someone else;  with you being a practicing Christian, then yes, according to the Bible, that would be considered adultery.  See Matthew 19:9.  If you divorced your husband simply for "just not getting along" then according to the Bible, your only alternative is to either stay single or make up again with your husband by remarrying him.  The reason why I stress "what the Bible says..." is because we live in a day and age where many view the Bible as outdated.  Many view marriage as something that you can just discard when things become difficult or stressful.  There is no viewing marriage as very sacred.  No one wants to hear "for better or for worse" or "until death do you part."  So, if you want to know God's view on this matter, then you have it.  If you want to know what society in general thinks, then read all the different comments that tell you that it is not adultery.  Then, at the end of the day, you will have to make the decision on who to believe.....God's word, or man's word!|`|AA11460234	Divorced and engaging in sex with another person is not adultery.<br>  <br>  Its simply having sex with another person.<br>  <br>  Now...if the other person is married then they've committed adultery. As for you....there is no place reserved in Hell for you. You've committed no sin. Of course you probably have because sex is for procreation according to the Catholic Church and not for fun but hey...if they're going to let me burn for all eternity over something as insignificant then that then so be it. Its worth it.|`|AA11447210	According to the xian bible, it would be...yes. However, many don't ascribe to that particular belief or that book of mythology. Most xians are 'cafeteria xians' anyway...they pick and choose which part of their holy book they want to believe and live by, and ignore the parts they don't like or agree with. That book doesn't acknowledge divorce under all the reasons the legal system does (such as simply 'irreconcilable differences').|`|HPqCRBq8aa	Its nothing wrong with that. Its something wrong with living your life with every word of the bible. If that's the case than all the people who live and screw their future wife before marriage are heathens. How many people do you know, who waited for marriage before they had sex and lived together?|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Although I can't cite chapter and verse, my understanding is that yes, it is adultery, because you are still married to your husband in the eyes of God.<br>  <br>  Edit: I wonder why people like Forlorn (above) don't seem to understand that comments like that are insulting to Christians.|`|AA11923501	You did nothing wrong.It would be impossible to follow every script in the bible.It would be impossible to interpret them all.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	If you are divorced, no, it is not adultery.|`|BMEMH7JLaa	If neither of you are married than it's just adultery <br>  However it is a sin|`|jCMSybAnaa	Yes.  In the eyes of man, divorce means you are free from the other person, but in God's eyes, if you divorced and there was no adultery, you are still married.  The reason is that he created the institution of marraige to symbolize his relationship with his church (us).  His love for us is so great, that he doesn't ever leave us.  At times, he's threaten destruction when we commit adultery against him (worshiping other ideals - esteeming something higher than him).  That's why he allows a way out if there is adultery.  I'm not trying to condemn you or anything, but to answer the question, yes it's still considered adultery because you are still considered by God to be married.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Well, getting divoriced just because you didn't "get along eral well" isn't a good reason for divorice imo.  Marriage takes work and it sounds like if that really was the case neither of you tried very hard...<br>  <br>  Yes, in the eyes of god that is adultery.  The only way you are really divoriced in the eyes of god is if there is adultery.  That can even consist of your husband looking at other women with lust in his heart.  So basically, if your hubby ever oggled other women innapropriately, and for too long, and took it too far (into fantasy thinking) then that could work too ;)  Cause lets face it, not many men don't do the above so you could use that to feel better if he did that kind of stuff behind your back.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	in the eyes of god, it's adultery.<br>  The get out of jail freecard on this comes from the Catholic faith and it's called an annulment.<br>  Most figure that an annulment is merely another way the church can make money off you.<br>  An annulment is a relgious term for: You were never 'really' married to this person in the eye of the church, therefore, not in the eyes of god...|`|bIimm8fSaa	Yes, it is considered adultery.  In God's eyes, you are still his wife.  Not to mention, sex outside of marriage is a no no as well.  But let's face it, times have changed so much.  And God is a forgiving God.  I'm not saying have sex.  My beliefs are like this, if you live up to your belief's and live them to the fullest, you are doing ok.  If you do something and in your mind you know it is wrong, then it is wrong.  If you do something and realize after you do it that it was wrong, ask for forgiveness.  God will forgive you for finding someone else to spend your life with.  He is an understanding God as well.  He understands that society makes it so hard to make a marriage work these days.  Pray about it and follow your heart.  If you are asking us, then God knows what you are thinking, so ask Him.  Best of luck to you.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	It wouldn't be considered adultery but it is considered fornication.  Since it would bother you so simply wait until married once again.  Your view of Christianity is different from many of us and thankfully most of us don't have to wear it on our sleeves to enjoy a relationship with God.|`|FzFSzilmaa	it is only adultery when you are one mans wife, not once you are divorced... though religion is just so boring... join us on the dark side where we don't get indoctrinated and brainwashed by a bunch of crusty old men from thousands of years ago... :D|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Actually yes it is.....but does this mean that you are not a good Christian.....NO it does not, remember that God is forgiving and does not hold grudges.  I really would not worry about it, the most important thing is that you God is forgiving.|`|SovaFpN8aa	Strictly based on Biblical scripture, yes that would be adultery. Also being no longer married, and not married to the new man you had sex with would be fornication.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Biblically-cheating. (Although most churches today are more relaxed about this rule in cases of abuse, etc.) You can't "just change your mind" and wish to no longer be married.<br>  Legally-you are ok.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	if the divorce is final and youre not legally married it isnt adultery.   its just not sex the way the bible says it should be (only between a husband and wife)|`|a4e8adbfe8b3093b90ed76b9ca47f82daa	I would say the marrage was not made in Heaven, If so you would still be together, So .. I say go for it and enjoy your new life/you only have one.|`|9tf9VF9naa	you are divorced right , then its not adultery.|`|O3EtP4vOaa	Why do you care?  Isn't divorce considered a sin if you are christian?|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	I wouldn't since you weren't married to him anymore. Your free to do what ever you please.|`|zFb022Iiaa	I guess in a biblical sense if you aren't married it's adultery. Maybe you should use a different word that is sometimes synonymous, cheating.  You didn't cheat on your ex spouse if that's what you are asking.  You didn't break vows or have a commitment to anyone else.  Don't beat yourself up.  If the church definition is what's important to you, then you know the other realities, like God forgives.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	It's your personal choice. If you believe it is adultery, it is adultery in your mind. As for me I would feel free to do anything I wanted, and did, once the divorce was  final. Most respondents are  going to be for you or against you. If are making this decision by  a survey from strangers just pick the majority of answers as the best choice. You must be ambivalent about this issue and have doubts or you wouldn't  have  asked the question. It's still up to you to decide which choice you could live with and which you could not. Don't confuse yourself by asking the question on Y/A.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	Reason for a Biblical divorce is based on adultery. It is called 'fornication' when a single person has sex with another person. It is sin. Sex is part of a marriage only according to the word of God.<br>  We all have 'free will'..but we don't have the right to freely sin when we know what we are doing is wrong in the eyes of God..rather we need to examine ourselves..repent of the sin, ask forgiveness from God and be cleanse by His blood..|`|eUUcriANaa	I believe it is fornication if you are not married to the man that you had sex with. I am a christian also and we all make mistakes. Jesus came to save the sinners. You have sinned yes but you are forgiven so learn from your mistake and move on. The divorce does not have to be for adultery it can be that he just did not want to be married to you anymore.|`|sMssDP1Xaa	Based on ones religious views it could be considered adultery, however I do not hold that view.  Once you are divorced you have no legal grounds for adultery therefore it is not adultery or any form of cheating.
CUB3wUdiaa	well boobs arent everything.  legs, eyes, calves, and of course the backside.  but alot of men do think boobs make the girl.  as far as porn goes, not al but most.  i dont know if hes lieing of not but he may think youre one of those girls that will think hes creepy for watching porn.<br>  <br>  ray|`|ROVExbzFaa	He mite just b using u 2 get in bed with him lol....idk a single guy that doesnt like boobs or doesnt watch porn...lol|`|FHiZ0a6Uaa	Don't know about alot of men but can tell u based on my man, he says anything over a mouth full is a waste. Maybe its a matter of how big a mouth the man has.<br>  <br>  as for porn, most men enjoy watching it every now & then but there's nothing wrong if they don't . Mine likes to watch it just a couple of times a years, he says it adds spice sometimes.|`|ac258ba4f1436e3dfef31f6f3ab3f0c8aa	Maybe he is just an "@ss man".  Some men really prefer looking at the rear instead of the front.  They just don't find boobs attractive.<br>  <br>  And no, there are men out there who don't like porn.  The visual images are just not stimulating - they have to *touch* to become aroused.<br>  <br>  These men are rare, but they do exist.|`|OCTvfDsxaa	Not every guy is into "boobs". A lot of guys like them but some guys find other body parts as attractive(like butts). They can cause health issues (bad backs). Some women have to get "breast reductions" done to fix problems. Also, not all guys look at porn. Some guys find it perverted but I really have no good sours on the porn thing.|`|XPdXlkc8aa	Look, if ur guy says he doesn't like boobs, he's just tryong to make u happy or lied so u wouldn't feel bad, and yes every guy looks at porn, trust me I've been to all my friends houses and they all have porn! Lol|`|MgMsMExPaa	That all depends on the guy. Everyone has a opinion.Not all men like to watch porn . A lot of men would rather fantasize than read or watch porn.|`|mXT4gQjRaa	maybe hes a "butt" man.
qe3NQIwgaa	now this is a fun one... i had never slept with anyone when i met my current boyfriend. and he did the SAME for me. try things like sexy outfits. go to DEB if there is one around you... they are always on sale there. and then get a pair of thigh highs. put it on in the bathroom and tell yourself your sexy, you have to believe it. and its going to be kinda weird for you when he first sees you but his reaction will be worth it!! <br>  <br>  music is always a good mood starter, but try some songs that are a little more hard core, like bullet for my valentine. the first time i put a playlist like this together (his music not mine though) it was awesome. i just kind of got into it and when he tried to take control i slapped him across the face, not hard, but still, then pinned his hands down (i was on top). he got this look on his face, and just wanted me.<br>  <br>  make sure you ask him to switch up the positions, kind of let him lead, then pull him closer. or pin his hands. or grab his face hard and kiss him deep.<br>  <br>  and last, but def. my favorite... next time try a blindfold... just bring one and put it on him first. this will make you feel like he isnt watching you, it will make you feel more comfortable being in control. its a good way to start out.<br>  <br>  good luck girlie!!!!<br>  just trust yourself.<br>  and remember, guys dont care what it is you do, they love it anyways.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	When a shy person is first coming out of their shell, they tend to be a bit silly when speaking their mind. I know, because I was there before. I was shy all through high school, and my first g/f had to break me out of that shell. As you get more experience with being open about your thoughts, it will get better. Life is all about learning, and some people just happen to start later than others. You will catch up. Think of it as your 2nd childhood. lol|`|AhcvwMhcaa	being confident will bring the sex appeal naturally. i used to be really shy with my boyfriend intimately too, and i learned through experience. he would help guide me by asking why i felt the way i do about getting closer to him. whenever i would feel nervous about trying something, he could never see why i was so scared, he would be all for whatever i wanted to do. as long as your boy is patient, he will most likely REALLY enjoy it :)|`|lZmf4KFdaa	Honey, why do you have to be the one making the moves to be sexy?  You are sexy just like you are.  God made boys to want to chase girls.  When they don't chase anymore, they lose interest.  Keep him chasing you.|`|IrrAZay5aa	Tell him you want to take a more active role and he should help you.
93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	You're not helpless because you will eventually move on. It's hard to let go but you have to remind yourself that you want to be the girl you were before you met him. It'll take time but surround yourself with family and friends. Some other things to do is do things that you enjoy doing alone or with others.<br>  <br>  Also, you need minimize contact with him if you want to let go of those feelings because he wants to keep you on a emotional leash but you have to strong enough to cut that leash.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|TBshXKt6aa	distract yourself.<br>  dont chase them, replace them!<br>  YES, it is much easier said than done i can understand that you really liked this boy and it is hard to let go but just distract yourself.<br>  work out, eat healthy, pamper yourself, realize your true value
rk2LknI7aa	no actually some girls like it the only down side is if u don't know ne thing about having sex the un experienced part kinda is but the guy im with he was a virgin when i got with him and hes great in bed and out of it lol but no its not a turn off at all it actually is a turn on for me.....that way i can teach him things lol....and i cant believe a guy is wanting to actually wait that long...its .......strange.....but kick *** lol|`|n4ugXhZVaa	Dude i dont know why these females are telling you these whack *** answers ima try and keep it real with you it really is a turn off. It makes you look kinda gay cuz to me you sound hot and i wouldnt know any other reason why you would still be a virgin and yeah you sound kinda sensetive and to me that really is a turn off but thats just me i dont like sensetive guys!|`|JyKFx3gnaa	Definitely a turn ON!!|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	it's a turnoff for the wrong type of girl that you want. so stick with your plan bud. it's really rare to find that in today's society!! :))<br>  <br>  stick to it!|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	No, I'm kind of indifferent to it, but i must say, I would be reluctant to be the one to finally take their virginity unless I married them. I would feel like I was forcing them to do something they didn't want to do. I mean, I will sleep with someone I'm not married to, but If they were a virgin I would have a much harder time with it, even if they swore it was what they wanted. <br>  It might be difficult, because I think sex is a great part of a relationship... <br>  <br>  How old are you? Don't worry, you'll find someone!|`|2271d7578f9b8099c73f2dadf80821f5aa	NOOOO if it is something it is more of a turn on...actually.|`|a984cQjKaa	no, it's not a turnoff.  it's fun playing the teacher!|`|AFGxrXSyaa	NO! TURN ON! =] u sound really purfect to me.|`|UX3xmWc6aa	NO!!! that would mean he really loves you not just wants you for other things.. i think its sweet :)|`|HrDcaocMaa	No!!!  Totally not... I actually admire you for your will-power against all those woman throwing themselves at you...  I always wished that my husband would have "waited" until I had come into his life - he was with 1 other girl before me and it was just a "sex" thing no love whatsoever... and I just think that if we could have been each others firsts, we'd have something even more special than we already do...  He regrets not waiting too...|`|b4199464cc3098e9c0df20d7671bd92baa	On the contrary =)|`|LIye5Tvuaa	No not at all. Its the complete opposite i'll tell you that|`|LpFKDXQFaa	hella no thats a turn on!! dont even worry about it:)|`|pDptioSNaa	I wud like 2 first get u drunk and listen to your REAL story :)|`|A0IvDqsGaa	no that is defintely not a turn off. I wish more guys were like you actually. Because all the guys i meet only want to have sex. I am the kinda girl that likes to wait until i am in love as well. You are meeting the wrong girls. Trust me when the right girl comes along, there will be absolutely no pressure and she will want to wait as well. I wish i knew you, cuz i would probably have the biggest crush on you!! lol! You seem like a good guy, stay that way. There aren't very many good guys still around. You are gonna make some girl really lucky someday.|`|XRX6vKNmaa	I think you have outstanding standards and I applaud you for that, not many men feel that way. However many woman have given up on that dream and they don't know what they want. There are a few good woman in this world that share the same standards as yourself. If you have drunk girls trying to go to your place you might be looking for a good girl in the wrong place. Be careful of those, they might offer a good time and add a little STD on the side.<br>  <br>  A guy like you would not turn a woman off. What turns them off is when they are horney and someone tells them No. That is not your fault, they can grab a toy to take care of that need. So keep your standard and don't bend them til you are ready.|`|qtlzdtMVaa	Oh my god...you are my dream guy lol! To bad I got a boyfriend cause I would be after you lol. <br>  <br>  Answer is TURN ON DEFO!!! I think you attract the wrong sort of girls lol probably cause your sexy by the sounds of it. It's the same with some girls, we want to wait till we are in love and to be in a serious relationship but guys just stab us in the back.<br>  <br>  God damn it, where were you 2 years ago lol!!! Not all girls are the same, what I mean is it's the same for both sex's. Stop looking and she will just turn up one day when your not expecting it. Just keep being yourself and don't rush. =)
VhrUtQc2aa	Well it's not easy to drop everything in your life and what you have worked so hard for just to make him happy yeah it does not bother him to go to SA because its part of his business.<br>  <br>  Explain to him that you just can't leave NY and that you have to think about your job to and of course you don't want to leave your friend who are basically like family to you.<br>  <br>  he has all his family there who do have except you fiance how do you know nothing will go wrong with his side of the family? how do you know that they will like you? sorry to up set you but if i was in your position i would think about these things.<br>  <br>  At the end you need to tell him that you are not able to leave due to work and what you have work so hard for yourself and that you love him very much and that you will be waiting for him when he come back from SA.<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK I hope everything goes well.|`|pZ9eA5rYaa	He is only going to be gone a couple of months so let him take care of his business and you stay and take care of yours. Look at the military people that get sent to war for 18 months and risk their lives. You have it easy compared to them and their family's. Quit making a big deal out of a small problem.|`|i7oGjwJBaa	if your relationship is stable there's no reason he can't go without you to take care of business and come back.  surely you guys could at least work out a few visits.|`|LCE8iUnWaa	I think the best way to make a decision is to make an informed one. Can you take some time off from work to go a week or two from your job to go see South Africa? While there you could scope out what your life would be like if you moved there. From reading your question it sounds like he is going to be there a couple of months and then he moves back to NY. So for a couple of months if you both love each other you will find some way of working it out.<br>  I think he is being a little selfish, especially if leaving this job might mean that you will not be able to find another job with the current economy.|`|bfc067ab537555ada57edd464a8dfb97aa	Drop him after 4 years he isn't going to marry you.<br>  Move on with your life, he is, can't you take a hint?
ifC1aFHxaa	As I read your question I'm convinced that you like the drama. "He won't let me" is a lie. <br>  Stop telling yourself this lie and simply cut off contact. Delete his number and change yours. <br>  A relationship is a two-way deal and you have choices and power here.<br>  I think you are suffering from some pretty low self-esteem and are being played by this "friend" to satisfy his needs, whatever those are. <br>  If you want more, really want more, you're going to have to ditch this bundle of fun and find a healthier friendship.|`|bFOqf40zaa	try to find another hot guy and think about him a lot.|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	just wait don t rush wait for the right time
fdtHELqcaa	tell'em how you feel and really give me my ten points jajaja j/k na but just tell'em how you feel|`|jIsAIwCgaa	let him know how much you value him as a friend and tell him that you dont want him to lead on the friendship then leave you.|`|3585617e66b6e408b3a748ee15238f75aa	Sounds good to me.|`|8P64hgL3aa	I would call that an intimite relationship.  I can't believe you don't consider this a relationship because it definitly is.
UsJDUm1Haa	it all depends. if your in love and think its the right time then you will do it. if you wait to get married then thats your choice :]|`|UYfeRLxwaa	Well, as nice as it is to imagine that fairytale lifestyle (meet "the one", spend the rest of forever with them and have great sex). But I think it is a good idea to test out the person before making a commitment. It would be a real shame if you married the man and found out that you both were sexually incompatible (it happens) and you both end up unhappy and unfulfilled. Sometimes, love can't be all there is when marriage is involved.|`|HKkbqlIuaa	There is no right or wrong answer here. This is a personal decision, and it is different for everyone. I personally did not feel it necessary to wait until my wedding night. I found the man I wanted to be with, and that was enough for me. However, if you do wait, I am sure your future husband would appreciate and respect that. =]|`|mnsN5iYGaa	Do what you have to do. If you have to study and go to college, then go for it. You will have plenty of time for sex later during or not during the matrimony.|`|EIJm83Psaa	Yes, Do what makes you happy. It better to find a guy who willing to wait with you and not have it be base on sex. Get you life together cause that one time you have sex you could end up pregnant.|`|srAP6Vzvaa	Wait. Women who remain virgins till marriage are truly Honorable and Dignified Women. I hold them in the highest of esteem.|`|y0GOP487aa	Yes! Do your future husband a favor, keep your virginity!|`|ThjUoWN6aa	sure! I say waiting is a good decision.|`|rZhUcLFmaa	If you have someone you really want to have sex with now, do it.<br>  <br>  If you're just not a very sexual person -- and your not sure you want it -- then why not wait for the time being.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	i think that is old school<br>  but if you think thats right then go ahead and do it there is nothing wrong with that !|`|9ko5WUFkaa	If it's right for you - go ahead and wait.<br>  <br>  But having sex wont make any difference to you getting your GED and going to college.  Millions of people have relationships, sexual or otherwise, and still get a good education.<br>  <br>  However, I think it would be really sad to marry someone not knowing whether you are sexually compatible or not.  Many divorces happen because two people don't match sexually - it's not the most important thing in a relationship but it is important.  Really, can you imagine spending your life with someone that you never want to touch or them touch you?  Even if you love them, love without sexual intimacy is more like the love between a brother and sister, not romantic love.  I know it's not a risk I'd be willing to take before deciding to commit myself to another person. <br>  <br>  You wouldn't buy a $500 dress without trying it on first, would you?  But you'd enter into a life long commitment without knowing if it fits properly in all aspects?  Waiting until marriage is like buying that dress - sometimes you get lucky and it fits just right and looks great but more often it's not quite right, or terribly wrong.  If the dress is wrong, you can take it back or just accept losing the $500 but you can't get back the time you spend with the wrong person.|`|Q5KFND17aa	its really up to you, but if they really suck in bed then theres no turning back....<br>  and sex is VERY important...well to me and lots of other people anyways.|`|XS3PexPIaa	Get a prostitute while you wait.|`|I59qE0WNaa	yes indeed..
hnpw7xataa	Hi L <br>  This is not an easy question because from a  guys point of view it could mean allot of things.  If you look at it in a platonic way any girl can be a girlfriend in that sense. Someone to be friends with with not having the pressures of sexual tensions. Then you have a girlfriends relationship of girls and that is so hard for any guy to figure out that no guy can ever understand it. Then there is the relationship girlfriend , the hardest but most rewarding type of relationship. This type of girl is special because you can be your self and yet be full of passion and love for each-other. This girl has to be more then just a  girlfriend she has to be your friend and your equal and yet be herself and have friends of her own. This girl has to be your lover and yet your enemy at times refusing to give in to your  child-est little complaints. She has to be Tender and understand but be able to hold her ground when she knows shes right. But then she has to be your lover and you both enjoy your feelings with each other minus the worlds and let Passion take control.|`|zs4Rpa6Vaa	um a friend thats a girl..>.< lol no seriusly!! i think a girlfriend is some one u have strong feelings for that u want more from her then just a peice of a$$..i mean come on there are hookers for a reason. a g/f is some one who u r loyal to and that u like to spoil wit gifts and kisses and hugs and etc. and girlfriend is the person u wanna be with forever.. unless somthing changes and feelings get mixed up. hope it hellped|`|n5YJS2Z7aa	someone who will never leave your side, your best friend, someone who you can pretty much talk about anything with.|`|4uOc515Laa	1.

7iEk06aDaa	I am  amazed that your parents would even consider kicking you out because you have migranes. They are no joke. My mother suffered with migranes and she would get them about 20 days out of 30. Have you had an MRI done and a CAT scan to rule out tumors?  My mom finally found whats called a beta blocker to control her migranes. I don't understand why they would call the cops if your such a good kid. Do they mean to drag you out of there? This is confusing me and I wish you would give more detail as better to help you.|`|AA12041870	Have you ever seen a chiropractor?  I had severe migraines for years.  I went to see a chiropractor in 1985 as a last resort, never believing that it would work.

They seem heartless at your current situation.?? But your number one issue is to find someone who can cure your migraines.?? I have known two people who had migraines but their symptoms where different.?? I would suggest that you have your doctor send all ex rays, MRI and other info to a doctor who specializes in these things.   I don't know where you live, but Duke University specializes in these areas.   Have someone like them look at your records and give you an opinion.   Hopefully they will find out what is causing your problems then your parental problems will go away.  I wish I could help you more, but your unreasonable parents are not going to go away.   You need to get better and then start your life away from your parents.   It could be that the stress from your parents is could be making your migraines worse.   Good luck.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	it amazes me how stupid parents can be. i truly think you will get to the bottom of your illness and be cured. if your parents do kick you out there is a bright side. you will find a way to finish college, and with your grades obtain a high paying job. then when they come grubbing on hands and knees you can tell them to hit the road. i have twin 17 y/o daughters and would not kick them out for any reason. good luck and nice job on your grades, you sound like a great girl.|`|FG0iPPIsaa	I dont no what to say. Dont ever feel like you shouldnt have been born because you sound like an amazing person. If you feel so down you should consider talking to a counsellor about this and they will help you feel better about yourself. I cant understand why your parents would want to kick you out for being ill but try to think about the future. Your going to a collenge of your choice and by the sounds of it your smart and will have a wonderful career. Try talking to your parents and ask them why they are treating you this way. I cant judge your parents but no one should be made to feel this way.|`|iTLutsayaa	Ask a neurologist to find you a medication that will help your migraines. You may have to try different ones, until you find the right one. Also pay attention to your caffeine intake. It may help your headache go away when you have one, or (less likely) make it worse. If you drink a lot of coffee one day, but not the next, the lack of caffeine can give you a terrible headache. If your headache is caused by muscle tension from your neck, then you may want to avoid caffeine entirely. If an aspirin makes your headache worse, then tell your doctor, as it may indicate brain bleeding  (aneurysm), which can be fatal (aspirin thins the blood and causes more bleeding, causing your headache to get worse).

f5a8d99afbb73cd0703df99b87996901aa	My 5 year anniversary is next month too!  My hubby drives a truck so we won't be together on the actual day :(  I've been out work since last summer so I know what you mean about being poor.  I have skimped on expenses enough to afford for him to buy a couple of new fishing rods he's been wanting. We'll take a trip to the river and spend the day fishing together.  Memories you make along the way are more special than any material gift you could give.  Take lots of pictures.  Happy Anniversary!|`|dUahG6H1aa	I do love anniversary too! So therefore i understand what u mean when u say that u truly love him. I think that he knows that u love him and he really doesn'tot care about a gift from u because u are already something special to him. <br>  So dont stress about getting him something special because u are already special to him.|`|0dICLCRZaa	well depends on where you live you go out on a nice walk on the beach at night and watch the sunset. and then maybe go out an get dinner some where. and go home and get busy.|`|DtkLsetkaa	Get him something he wouldn't expect.  For my ex-husband (lol) and our first anniversary, I had our wedding music framed as a background for a black and white pic of us from when we first met, with a little plaque on it.  I think the whole thing cost me 30 dollars.  For our earlier celebrations, I would get him goofy things that would make him laugh, more than sappy things that would make him swoon :)  He always seemed to really enjoy that stuff.  I would go back to your earlier days together and get him something fun from back then.  Maybe go back to the resteraunt where you had your first date. Or get him the DVD of the first movie you saw together?  Those are the things that mean the most :)
71VRvldJaa	No, I don't believe that.  Love needs time to develop and grow.<br>  You can be infatuated or you can fall in lust if it's a physical attraction but it definitely aint love!|`|DKfScL8taa	Yes I do. I have "fallen in love instatnly" a few times. but that wasn' real love at first sight. Maybe it was puppy love at first sight. My husband was most definitely love at first sight.|`|3BwPtNi2aa	Love at first sight is visual stimulation not emotional . I don't believe in love at first sight but rather lust at first sight.|`|524ec041944e55e9bc315c82317825aeaa	love at first sight is real as life|`|AA11198190	lt often feels that way....simply because you have met someone new,and you are attracted to them.....instantly.<br>  But it usually is not love.....|`|4rJYZ4JYaa	haha all the time|`|2svonkw1aa	no. it's lust. there is no love at first sight. only lust and attraction. it can turn to love but it's not until you get to know them.|`|udsWW6y5aa	Lust.|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com|`|4QiUnFMgaa	yes!|`|7HYJG7q9aa	ya y not crazyer things have happened|`|jW6E3ffHaa	It hAppened tome it could happen to u|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i do believe in love at first sight.|`|s0GU6ULMaa	It's the appearance that draws our attention<br>  <br>  and the personality and heart we fall in love with..|`|qeSXDEMZaa	Yes, It happened to me and I wasn't a believer. If you feel like it often than it might not actually be love, it could be to feel that comfort of being loved and what not. You'll know if "the love at first sight" is for real, I realized as soon as it happened to me and I am still with him 3 and a half years later!|`|nPjMHT0Saa	Hey, you see its not real love, i have a friend that had the same problem every guy that gave her the slightest bit of attention she'd go home and keeps thinking about him that he is probably in love with her and such, but its not true love, its a phase you know, I know it feels so real , but real love is not something that we can put like basics and rules for , like if you feel 1, 2 and 3 its love, once u meet the right person , there will be chemistry and u know small hints and ull feel it for real u know !<br>  I really hope this makes any sence !|`|edpKlRnhaa	A lot of times if you feel like your falling in love it's just because the girl/guy you are falling in love with is really hot.. To tell you the truth I do believe in love at first sight, but usually the people you fall in love ..with absolutely hate you..lol... Hope this helps..|`|AA11655703	No. It's impossible. Love is not a feeling. It's a commitment to the other person. How can you know that you want to make a lifetime commitment to someone you've just seen? Why would you want to? What you are feeling is lust, which will fade away.|`|b8QM7NY6aa	Honestly, no but it could be, see i know exactly how you feel, coz i'm one of those love at first site junkies. Truth is it never really is real love just infactuation. sorry :(|`|OJpjktj6aa	Yeah, I've been there before.  I spoke to someone for a long time and then met for the first time.  You just feel an automatic bond. Its rare, but it can happen.  nothing is impossible.|`|XUD9AfERaa	maybe your an emotional person that takes people for who they are and see the personal values rather than looks. In which you connect and become attached emotionally.|`|Giun40wPaa	There's no such thing as love at first sight. Well, at least that's what I believe. <br>  It's all just infactuation.(in love with the persons looks)<br>  If you don't know someone how can you truly love them?|`|MJkiui20aa	its not LOVE its a crush.<br>  and yes i do believe in love at first sight<br>  but not deeeeeep love.|`|uKVZVID6aa	I dont believe it.for me important to look their good heart.|`|hpKJP2Ciaa	no|`|VLa0RlLDaa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I believe in lust at first sight and infatuation but not love.|`|xNRlvvZZaa	yes i do perhpas its all a dream<br>  <br>  but without this dream life is useless
2pxGPcxaaa	those type of guys see women only as sex objects. They are perverted, porn freaks who probably still live with their mom.|`|f8531989672c18c4535bcda561ab4073aa	He is just trying to show out for his friends. I think it is a little over the top. It is disrespectful and offends some women.  Most of the time the type of guys that do that.Are not the type that makes a good  person to date or have a relationship with. there just fishing .. never really looking for one to keep . just seeing what is out there one hookup  with one night at a time .|`|e8Z2FVofaa	I'm a guy and when I see a girl who is hot or something like that I just let my mind do the work.  Cat calls to me are inappropriate behavior and rude as all get out.  I give dirty looks to people who do it around me.  If it's one of my friends I tell them what I think, and tell em not to do it around me ever.<br>  <br>  If I were a gal, I'd just ignore the jerks.|`|74gPuaXMaa	Those guys aren't making fun of girls, they're cocky trying to play the game. In reality they fail worse than the mysterious guys in the long run.|`|5372aOmFaa	some guys are just lame.. a guy in the bar i work at told a girl she is prettier than pockets on a tee shirt..
QODJNf1oaa	Well, maybe you can find a better way to get him to help himself. Try talking to him about it nicely, suggesting you both go for walks together, or join a gym together and be on his side through the process. Even though you are the one suffering here, it sounds like he really needs some attention from someone in the mental health field that could possibly get him back on track.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	The obvious solution is to tell your spouse how you're feeling.  You don't have to come across as insulting.  You could even put it like how much more turned on you would be if there were some weight loss and some muscles.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	It sounds like he probably is clincally depressed.  Can you talk him into going to marriage counseling?  Through that, he could get the help he needs and not feel like you're attacking him and telling him that there's something wrong with him (which could make it worse).<br>  <br>  It also seems like you're being shallow.  If it were a man saying this, the women on here would tear him apart.  Did you expect him to look perfect for the rest of his life?  Looks fade.  We all gain weight as we get older, we all get old and wrinkly.  One day, you too will become old and ugly.<br>  <br>  This is the person you promised to love forever, and now is when he needs you most.  Depression is a disease, just like cancer or strep throat, and it is not his fault.  He needs your support if he is to get better.<br>  <br>  And you know what?  Sometimes I don't feel like having sex, but a lot of times I will do it anyway because I know it will make my husband happy and seeing him happy makes me happy.  And almost always, I end up enjoying it.  It just takes me a little while to get my engine started.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You're wrong.  Depressed people can and DO get better.  It's a lifelong disease that you have to work at, but with the right therapy and medications, people get better.<br>  <br>  I like the idea of the two of you exercisring together.  Start easy, take your child and take walks together.  Get some fresh air and some sunshine.  Sunshine is a natural anti-depressant and will make both of you feel better.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	Tell him how you feel and watch what he does.  If he doesn't care enough about you to clean up his act then your relationship is as rotten as you think it is.  <br>  <br>  If in fact it is that bad I think you should reevaluate your position about divorce.|`|W0qFAIVuaa	No person should have to have sex with someone the don't disire.I wish I could help.But I see no solution.Do you have people you could stay with while you reorganize a life without the fat slob.I'll bet he stinks too.|`|bIimm8fSaa	You had to love him at some point to marry him, right?  Well, find that person again.  Sit down and talk to him.  Tell him it's important that the two of you have a serious talk.  Let him know you still love him, and you want to be with him, but you want the person back you married.  Then help him.  Cook low fat foods for him.  Exercise with him.  In a marriage you are a team, so be his team mate and help motivate him.  Stand beside him all the way.|`|xQnkYyocaa	Tell him nicely that he needs to address these issues. Maybe you could join a gym TOGETHER. That way he doesnt feel picked on. Not to be rude, but nobody is perfect! Work on this problem as a couple.|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Treat him to a make-over.|`|4e78695008f60b02690030274e8f9ee8aa	If you are not happy... your child will not grow up happy.<br>  Your child has to see a healthy relationship in the house in order for him to have  a healthy relationship in the future.   <br>  <br>  I don't think you should tell your husband he grosses you out etc.  But maybe in a loving moment tell him you want him to take better care of his health.. and the gaining weight might make him sick and you don't want to loose him.  Maybe he needs to hear that.  Perhaps he is not happy with you either and that's what is making him like this.  If you reject him because of the way he looks, that is a big crusher to a man.<br>  I know you did not tell him but I'm sure he notices you rejecting him.   Are you saying if he is skinny you would have intimacy with him? Or is the love just gone?|`|PWN5rqgxaa	dont talk to him about being disgusting... talk to him about taking care of himself for you and the kid... tell him you love him and you want to be sure hes going to be around for a long time with you and would he please go see a doctor and get started taking better care of himself... you will probably have to make the appointments and commit to doing those things with him... eating right together  exercising together etc
Qv2bUOqaaa	Just start saying that you are busy and slowly stop talking to her. It is possible to ignore someone and be cordial without them knowing you dislike them. If she asks to come over, or borrow your things.. just say you're busy or that you really don't like to share your stuff. If she gets aggresive, have someone else back you up. I'm sorry she's doing this to you. Best of luck!|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Stop being a wimp.  Why don't you just give her your allowance too. She probably is just grabbing a snack while you do her homework for her. She probably criticizes your clothes and wonders why you bought it in "that" color.  You doesn't like your make up, and tells you next time to buy the good stuff becasue thiis shade doesn't look right on her.   Oh, and you are out of juice and potato chips.<br>  <br>  It is your parents' house.  Tell her they don't want her there if you are too chicken.|`|seqEdwwnaa	if you dont really like her...then your not friends with her....just tell her to stop coming over
H9Bzw0VNaa	I guess because a smile means ur interested.  Its like a question: You smile (Are you interested?) and they either smile back (YES) or don't (NO).  Simple as that..  women don't see it as an act of kindness, just as a guy tryin to get laid.|`|To85W1Rgaa	i don't know why they would do that. most girls i know would smile back or wave or something.|`|AenRh1eRaa	when i smile they smile back|`|f25peTSXaa	usually their not sure if your checking them out.... how can youuu tell btw?|`|WYPEG8l7aa	Because they aren't into you.

FHiZ0a6Uaa	That's fine but u need to look deep inside yourself & make sure that u can truly be only a friend with him & not be hoping for something more. If u can honestly say "yes" then friendship would be great but most ex's have a hard time dealing with memories of when you were a couple  & this tends to cause trouble|`|uIAHkm0Naa	i think it could work out- my exes are some of my best friends : )

eNulfbs7aa	ooohh....your in sooo much trouble..I would get a passport and get out of the country...forget illegal ( which it is) she is going to kill you...save your life and get out of here now..that is just scarey...|`|FyqCMrCdaa	Nah your fine..lol yeah thats illegal man. Invasion of privacy. Proof beyond reasonable doubt might i add. lol|`|SRzL2Wexaa	Wow, you're creepy.|`|1WUnsLNyaa	Well besides all the "personal" reasons that happened between you two, she obviously isn't meant for you. You should be with someone that you trust. You shouldn't be so paranoid or she's not girlfriend material. And yes it is illegal. Just imagine if you had someone watching you all the time and had no idea. If she found out you were doing this, most likely shed run|`|nJ9lGMmQaa	This is very disturbing. You have no trust for this girl and that is what a relationship is built on. I don't know why you feel this is necessary, but it is so wrong.|`|wsvkYamfaa	wow id hate have u as a bf!!why dont u trust her and yeah it illegal invasion of privacy!!if u dont trust her why are u with her!! if she finds out ur screwed!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ITYz2WKaaa	i think it is illegal and second off all you look like a stalker. If you don't trust her or something then talk to her and see what's up, because if she finds out you might be in trouble.|`|xVEcaOveaa	yes thats illegal!!|`|GqZezanmaa	dude.. ur invading other's privacy...<br>  u better pray that she doesnt find out or shes gona kill ya
HKkbqlIuaa	No it is not. This is only okay when it's been a short, relatively meaningless relationship. If you are planning on ending it, you owe them the decency to tell them. It's very selfish to just avoid them. It's almost like stringing them along until they finally give up on you. If you want to dump them, then have the b*lls to do it to their face. Wouldn't you like for someone that had spent almost a year with you to at least give you that much. They deserve it.|`|yBnmqLZ7aa	Just get it over with, don't ignore the guy that's mean. Just tell him you don't feel the passion like you used to and want to break up. Guys hate it when girls play games with them. Don't be mean and let the two of you get on with your lives

GmTMVmASaa	could be another case of, if you can't be with the one you love, then love the one you're with.<br>  but yea it can turn into the real thing.|`|vQtRvX7jaa	hi.<br>  <br>  well, you have to follow your heart. <br>  if your heart tells you that this person was just the only choice because no one else came along, then maybe its time to end your relationship.<br>  <br>  but if you feel that you have actually connected. and you are really starting to fall for him, then go right ahead and fall. ?<br>  <br>  don't be afraid to fall for him. <br>  maybe God meant for him to come along as the only one. <br>  maybe not. <br>  <br>  take a chance.<br>  <br>  "we come to love not by finding the perfect person. but by learning to see and imperfect person, perfectly."<br>  <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK! ?|`|1Z13L9h2aa	Well yes that could be love.<br>  The thing is, there will come a time when you realize he's not really what you're looking for. So if there's one lesson in loving that single people should keep in their minds is that they should never settle for someone available. Just because he is available you go grab the opportunity to have a relationship with him..that is so wrong and that's not how true love goes.|`|wrHh16tcaa	Yes, it can be. You are very lucky to have him, most people spend most of their lives lokking for that special person and in the journey end up gettng heartbroken, you are lukcy you found yours without pain.|`|a0Vg5vMyaa	lead tu love beecuz u dntz kno if hee feel sumtin for u|`|IW592N5Zaa	if you know that you'd take another over him then it isn't love...but in time it could trun into it. you can learn to love him.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	could go that way. but, make sure you are not doing it for self-gratification!!
T32iPt8saa	yea give him a call, cant hurt i mean your his gf. but rember if something happened and he is still out there he might not have any signal or he is busy packing or something <br>  just dont act on anything until you know all your facts <br>  you can text him and he could reply when he can so you dont bug him if thats what your worried about|`|GdPCE9wbaa	Give him a call|`|AA11715395	give him a bit of time.. I'm sure he'll be pleased. If by the end of the weekend you haven't heard anything, then call. Sunday night.
xz0QrA6caa	Looks like he just wants you to want him.  He sounds like one of those guys that needs attention.  He might not really want to break up with you but he might like the reaction he gets from seeing you upset.  Usually in cases like this the guy will eventually ask the girl back and be very glad to see the girl get so happy and excited to be taken back.  If you don't take him back that would hurt him a lot being that I think he is looking for attention and reactions from you|`|rQ7dI88Maa	Yes, you did. By ignoring him you're letting him know  that you will not be a part of his games.You have a backbone and will not be taken advantage of.  Good for you! He keeps hurting you because it's allowed. I'd breakup with such a character. He is no friend or boyfriend. Move on to someone who respects your feelings.|`|09uvIdllaa	girl of course you did the right thing ..he breaks upp with you then 6 days later he expects u to b nice to him! you did the right thing &+ I think u should keep ignoring him because If you do that then he will notice ur not paying any attention to him cuz thats wat he wants ATTENTION FROM YOU|`|2zY0j133aa	wow! that is so mean!<br>  he waited up until the day after val. day! where you expecting a nice V-Day?<br>  ignore him! you need time for yourself to move on. you going to say is going to make nothing but the moving on process  is hard.<br>  and ohh, by the way don't try to be friends with him!|`|0MuQoVzPaa	Yes you did the right thing! Don't go back with him no matter what! He is a jerk and he is playing silly games. And yes he wants a reaction from you.|`|DWW9Ri8Jaa	It does not matter whether you did the right thing or not. What matters is that you do the right thing at the right time.|`|3MylpuxPaa	i hate text messaging relationships|`|3dcdb1c14873af05666b96abaeb32ba4aa	yes he is playing games|`|MnmNl6Hiaa	stupid kids shouldn't ask stupid question quiet wasting your life over such stupid things and grow up|`|4uOc515Laa	yes.|`|db642d0583d7a6d17185a02354906b18aa	yes he is, because you let him.|`|M0KLWw54aa	he's a jerk!|`|kO5YwDlBaa	he is sick & selfish. had he truly loved u he would not have hurt u....period!|`|ieTOMSbWaa	yeah, he sounds a spinless cock?|`|1dV9DyMfaa	he is playing games with you girl...<br>  and you did it right...ignore his *** cause that's what he deserves!|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Straights my mate ...in that big sea of love on the GOLDEN glove  Think that Rourk  deserves that baby ...just maybe ?|`|BJERgbM5aa	Sure you did right.  I think he knows he made a big mistake. Why?  He went to your aunts house & the excuse was to see your cousin.  He could have text the cousin/called the cousin/met the cousin.  But he went there and made sure that you knew he was going there.  Wanted to see if you would show up.  In his mind, you showing up means that you are willing to see him again.  Then, he reminds you of 'your manners'  -  'come up and say hello'.  A desperate attempt to get things going again.  Ha.  You definitely did the right thing.  Ignore him.  BUT, if you want to go back with him, first he must learn his lesson and pay for his bad judgment.  Go Girl.|`|c5UAa65qaa	The only way he can keep playing mind games with you is if you worry about what you think he does or doesn't want you to do.  If your instincts tell you to ignore him, great; listen to them.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	he's playing mind games and you wouldn't want to marry that cos he'll just get worse.<br>  he was cruel to break up with you before Valentine's too and was a coward doing it over the phone!!<br>  yes, he wants reaction, don't give him any.<br>  <br>  move on and forget this jerk|`|AFGxrXSyaa	he wants you to chase him. dump him hes bad news. go find someone that will love you.|`|UinOWcMUaa	kick him to the curb-- no one needs drama in their lifes :)|`|EmMxNWyLaa	yes, he is a jerk|`|FwdBKodSaa	What you should do is ignore him as much as possible. Then he will play returning to you to which your best reaction is to send him away. Only then will he learn the lesson that he should never play with anybody.|`|JGOeJOFDaa	He's playing games. <br>  <br>  But "why does he keep hurting me" is the wrong question to ask.  He's hurting you because you let it hurt.  Take control of the situation. Stand up for yourself. And move on.|`|TrEYixLXaa	Looks like he is playing games, or trying to get some sort of reaction from you.  Just act indifferent, works like a charm :)|`|hHndD5SEaa	Yeah hes definately messing with your head - you did right to ignore him and the best thing you could do is continue to ignore him... dont allow him get to you<br>  xx|`|a984cQjKaa	yeah, he sounds like he's trying to play games with you, so good for you for ignoring him.  keep up the good work.|`|d861778018432f5f26321e9fa06ec7faaa	He is playing mind games and it looks like he is winning. You should have said hello|`|A0IvDqsGaa	yes you definitely did the right thing. He sounds like a complete a$$ and you need to get rid of him.|`|rNiTscBVaa	hell yeah you did the right thing and you shouldn't txt or talk to him at all anymore
FzFSzilmaa	different cultures have different ideas about things... but you were too young to be left alone at a weekend...<br>  <br>  your choice as to whether you should love/respect her...<br>  <br>  personally, i'd hit 18, then disappear from her life...|`|d30f07a15879f4c7bb74b100b34135afaa	Get over it.  She did the best she could.  When you are a parent, you will understand that raising a child is one of the most difficult things to do--wonderful, but difficult.  I'm sure she did the best she could.  Get on with your life, and when you are a parent, as my mother used to say, "don't do what I did--learn from my mistakes".<br>  <br>  Sound hard hearted?  Yes it is, but life is hard.  You will find that from adversity comes strength.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	i don't care if she was from mars, she was wrong.  forgiveness is up to you.|`|r3uKj1Azaa	Was she slapping you hard? Not too long ago that was considered good parenting, obviously it isn't now but it isn't the biggest crime in the world as long as it isn't hard. Clearly if she was doing it hard enough to bruise and more out of anger than as a form of discipline - then that's a whole different story!<br>  <br>  That is too young to be left alone, have you tried talking to her properly about it? Maybe she regrets leaving you alone, she didn't really think it through properly that's for sure.
UAfAtaVwaa	It's hard being in a relationship with someone who is insecure, especially if you're insecure yourself.<br>  <br>  The reason why that person is probably skeptical about relationships is probably due to the influence they've experienced. It could be that their parents or their closest family members or friends have failed to pull through a successful relationship, so they've probably turned it into a negative thing. Being surrounded by so many examples of the bad effects of love, the person would probably be reluctant to start anything new with anyone. It's the fear of being rejected.<br>  <br>  But just remember that the whole point of the successful relationship is that both sides are willing to try. That alone will be strong enough to make things last. She/he can't judge their future from stories told by others.|`|OntO6wE4aa	It all depends what side of love the person who's giving the opinion is. It depends on what stage of love the persons in who's giving the opinion. People who gives a negative attitude about love and relationships has some issues of their own. They have a love so good that you can't achieve that level with the one your with. Ones who have had love go bad and see your mate as the same kind of person who did them wrong. Stay away from negative divorced people. No matter how many times your heart has been broken give love a chance. When you receive it the rewards will be alot greater than being alone with the people who said "I told you so". There are people who can see that your being abused in a relationship better than you can. Those people you should listen to. They know you can't be happy. If your spiritually, mentally, and physically happy then let people think what their going to think. good luck|`|DgFhlJvYaa	Some people think differently on this topic. Not all relationship's are doomed to fail. It take's 2 people to make things work out & if only one person is tryin & the other one isn't then it will fail. Both people have to work on thing's in order to make it last. Some people say nothing last 4 ever but in some cases it's wrong so you just have to decide who is worth the time & who isn't.|`|HkImCOSuaa	The only people who think relationships are doomed to fail are ones who did fail and havent tried again. My boyfriend and i have been together for 2 year and we are great.. were not doomed to fail we are perfect for each other.|`|oHSsJ4Koaa	because not everybody has a perfect relationship even if they did have the perfect man... people don't want to loose something they have in common with.. or it would ruin them.. not every relationship will go right that's why people think it will fail..|`|HrDcaocMaa	Because they let outside influences affect them so damn much...  If you ignore everyone around you and truly follow your heart, than you will have a very loving and long-lasting relationship.... ?|`|kO5YwDlBaa	they either knew of or have had bad experiences.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Honey ...us oldies ....we boldies!!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	I met my husband in Pogo. I am in Oregon and he was in Kansas. He came to see me and it our fate was sealed. We got married 6 months later. Going to be year number 7 on January 6th. Yes it can work if it's meant to be.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Look at the world. <br>  <br>  Look around you.  Your friends, your parents, etc.<br>  Look on TV, mags, <br>  Look at the salaries of divorce attorneys<br>                      <br>  The odds are stacked against you|`|263NkN3paa	In life precedents play a great part in forming a general or universal mindset.So since there have been innumerable incidents where loving relationships have not succeeded into lifelong committments, the general mindset has become negative.People in love feel insecure about the fact that whether their love/relationship will actually blossom or succeed.<br>  I however feel that one should try and do away with these negative thoughts because each and every relationship has its own entity and does not borrow from something else.There are particular factors(different in each case) which run the relationship.So if a person does away with the general statistics and tries to make his relationship work,there is no reason why his relationship won't succeed.He just needs to do away with his insecurities.But let's not forget the hand of destiny-if you're meant to be together,you will be.|`|TrEYixLXaa	I also think that relationships are doomed to fail.  That's cause I had my heart BROKEN.  I fell in love at 16 for the first time & ended the relationship at 19.  I am now 24 & the heartache is STILL there.  So, the people who usually think relationships are doomed to fail are most likely the one's who have had their heart broken into tiny pieces.|`|AA11447210	Because statistically the odds aren't in their favor long term. However, plenty of relationships do go the distance. It doesn't really matter what other people think (with regard to adult relationships) but whether or not the parties involved are looking at the situation realistically and if they feel ready to work hard to keep it together for the long haul.|`|AFGxrXSyaa	they believe that because they have either had a failed relationship or just follow celebrities who mostly dont last long. but for most it does.
NLEmQZSsaa	First of all, no matter what you tell her she's going to try and get you something special. I'm the same way. My husband gives great gifts, but when I ask him what he'd like for xmas or his birthday I get, "nothing, I don't need anything."  It makes it very hard and makes me hate the xmas holiday.  So the best way to go about it is. If she asks you what you want for your birthday have and answer for her. If you really don't want her to spend a lot find something inexpensive and tell her that its what you REALLY want!  She will feel like she made you happe and you will be genuinely happy!|`|l7fyLFFtaa	I agree with Laura. Your girlfriend was so excited by the gift that she got and that made you feel really good as well. If she goes out of her way to get you something nice then she gets that gift-giving "high" that you just experienced. Everyone wins. <br>  <br>  For a lot of us it's easy to give but difficult to receive. I love giving gifts but when someone gets me something I feel embarrassed. Strange. <br>  <br>  I remember when my girlfriend got me a DVD player. This was 7 years ago so it was a big deal. I had never had a DVD player. I thought it was the coolest thing ever. I knew that I wasn't going to be able to get her a good enough gift to match that no matter how much money I spent. She told me that her joy came from the look and excitement on my face and that made it all worth it. She also said that if I were to buy a gift for her to try and match the gift she gave me it would cheapen the whole thing. In other words she made it okay for me to just except the gift, no strings attached. Then she told me to cook HER dinner for once. I did. It burned. She never let me cook dinner again.<br>  <br>  If you really don't want your girlfriend to get you anything do what my girlfriend did. It worked and I loved her even more for taking that pressure off of me.

e7307c17e7293ec6e48fd95beeea15abaa	Ok, sex is the most intimate, method of communication between a man and a woman.<br>  Unfortunately, most of us don't learn how to "Talk," until we look into ourselves and realize that making love is just that, making love. not just f*cking. Making love is an art, and art takes time to create. Foreplay is a part of that. It should be mutual, between a man and a woman, there should be no grand expectations other than both partners trying to please the other. No competition, no comparisons, just 2 people sharing feelings. Sex is love in motion.<br>  Men should work to learn what pleases his partner and women should do the same. Ask,  keep your senses alert to what actions, looks etc please your partner.<br>  Don't expect earth shattering orgasms, every single time. <br>  Make love.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	wait i thought for women foreplay was a one way street.|`|5mTKspfYaa	if you don't communicate with your partner that's problem numero UNO.<br>  <br>  If you're not into foreplay thats problem number TWO<br>  <br>  sexual relationships can be great if there is communication and compromise.  maybe you like one thing more, he likes another think less... and so one.

Does he feel the same way? Maybe you should get marriage counseling. Or if you are on the wilder side, try a swinger meetup for a little while. There are tons of things you can try to spice things up for the two of you before being tempted or actually having sex with someone else. Try role play, as in dressing up in different characters so it's like being with someone different. I don't know any other suggestions. Just think outside of the box, but stay true to each other. Keep the lines of communication open so as not to hurt each other.|`|ceeade679167ec316fc6cfc5f38dcb7baa	This is normal feeling. I am sure everybody feels this way including your spouse. Wanting another person does not mean you don't love your spouse any less. Humans are just animals that have desires. Talk to him about what his fantasy is regarding sex. I bet he would like stuff that you did not know about. Just remember to have a open mind and not become jealous.

It's if it turns into regret or an overwhelming desire to take action or you have a specific, attainable guy in mind that you have problems.<br>  <br>  What exactly do you think you'd get out of being with another guy that you're not getting from your husband?  Maybe there's something the two of you could try to satisfy those urges.  Think it through, talk to him about what you'd like to do differently, and go from there.|`|sGP6s7uraa	See, this is the problem when you either marry too young, don't "try on any shoes" before you get hitched or both.<br>  <br>  Talk to your pastor/preacher/whatever religious figure in your life and tell them what you're feeling.  They will be able to give you more sound and religious advice.|`|SovaFpN8aa	1) Don't tell your husband about this curiosity. You are responsible for your own actions, so don't act on this curiosity with someone else.<br>  2) Try different positions or sexual activities with your husband, change up your game, maybe your love life has become too predictable.<br>  3) Talk to your husband about a little role-play. Get all sexied-up and go by yourself to a bar. He will come in a little later and act like he doesn't know you, and hit on you and pick you up. Make it a fun game. Have sex somewhere kind of daring (car, restroom, outdoors, etc...) with your husband.<br>  4) Sometime, when your husband is gone, rent a pornographic movie, and get a sex toy, fantasize about what is going on in the movie.<br>  5) DON'T CHEAT ON YOUR HUSBAND, DON'T EVEN FLIRT WITH OTHER MEN - that would be the recipe for disaster.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	It's a normal feeling. Don't let yourself freak out because you are curious.<br>  <br>  The only thing that will make it truly horrible is if you act on those feelings with anyone but your spouse.<br>  <br>  Try to get adventurous in the bedroom, try new things, new experiences, etc. You all might discover new sides to each other.|`|bIimm8fSaa	If it makes you feel any better, it's like this.  In the beginning, it's exciting.  But after that, it isn't the same if you don't love the person.  It's so much better when you are in love.  But if it's something that is really bothering you, try role playing.  Then he can be whoever you want him to be and you can be whoever he wants.  Good luck.|`|kjgonYlgaa	This is completely normal.  You may even fantasize a little but don't take it beyond that.  Talk to your spouse about this, you may be surprised to learn that he too has wondered this.  How long have you been together?  Why don't you give fantasy role play a try?  Make up the characters and the scenario and see how that plays out?  I could be a great way to spice things up.
PAY58zPNaa	its definitely a good idea to wrap your arms around her during the movie, only if you think she is into you, if she doesn't like you, don't bother, it would make her feel awkward if you do.|`|aRcHbMXoaa	You obviously like her

Maybe as you have said you will be there for her you can say to her that you will take her to the doctor and simply be there for her. I wish you the best and your friend also|`|seqEdwwnaa	tell her to get a pregnancy test...thats really the only way she will know
UAfAtaVwaa	I totally get what you mean.<br>  <br>  First off, kudos to you for finding the strength to move on with your life, and i'm glad you're happy with your singlehood.<br>  <br>  Your girlfriend seems to maybe have rushed into her relationship with the guy too quickly. Let's call him A. Though they seem happy now, she's probably at the stage where the initial flame for A is slowing down, and her head is much clearer than it was after the break up. So now she's thinking back to what actually happened and why it happened. The problem is that you two probably didn't have any closure. <br>  <br>  So she comes back to you and being a girl [i say this because i'm like her in a way], she loves the idea of having two guys in love with her. She wonders if you still have anything for her because it'd boost her ego a little, and girls hate it when guys get over them after liking them for a while. The reason why she's giving you mixed signals is probably because, like i said before, she's only JUST got that post-break up haze out of her head, and she's confused about whether she's really given up her feelings for you, or they never actually left.<br>  <br>  Once again, it's due to the absence of closure. Basically, what you have to do is find a neutral place that's peaceful, and sit her down and talk. Before you go into it, remind yourself that you're not going to interfere with A and her, and you're in the process of moving on with your life. Remind yourself of the reasons why it didn't work out in the first place. You and your ex need to discuss what actually led to the break up. Start with a casual topic like what she's been up to, and then slowly work your way into the good things that you appreciated in the relationship, and the less happier times. Do NOT dwell too much on the past though, and don't hold any grudges on things she did to you before. You must establish the fact that you're willing to be friends, and you'll give her as much time as she needs, though you WON'T be her fall back guy. <br>  <br>  My advice is to just move on. You can't date a girl who's uncertain about her feelings WHILE she's still dating someone. You need someone who can think rationally in the worst situations. Plus, she has a boyfriend now, and SHE says she doesn't think she could handle seeing you with other girls?!! Sounds awfully selfish, and it shows she's greedy and doesn't want to let you go to anyone else.<br>  <br>  Sorry it was long. Hope it helped.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	my basic rule on being friends with exes:<br>  if even one of you has romantic feelings still for the other then, "no".  As long as one of you still holds a torch for the other then you aren't at a place where you can be "just friends" right now.  Some people do get there, some people never do.  <br>  <br>  The reason I say no is because the one with the warm fuzzies, may not tend to his or her romantic life and may be holding out hope for a reunion that may never come and then that one has wasted a good portion of time that you can never get back.<br>  <br>  You both need to be at the same level of emotion before you can try being friends.<br>  <br>  If keeping her in your life will keep you from moving on with your life then just say good bye and keep your fond memories.  Sometimes you need time apart before you are ready to be friends.  It doesn't sound like either of you is interested in picking back up where you left off but neither of you is at a place where you can be just friends yet.|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	though you had FUN with her, you must realized that she is NOT the only female on earth that you can have fun with. She has moved on and so should you. I have never (personally speaking) maintained friendship with ex-es. It's too emotionally draining. Ignore her messages. She made a decision and so should you.<br>  Every time i broke up with someone, I hurted. And, then when the next GOOD PERSON came along, i wondered what I was doing worrying about the ex for! <br>  It just wasn't meant to be. But, there are plenty of other girls out there!!|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Unless you have children together there is no need to even be in contact much less be friends. I'd simply forget about her. She's yesterday's news.|`|PY51kBTjaa	The best advice I can give is cut ALL contact with her, if will be hard at first but you will soon forget about her and still will miss you|`|hNwqqn3Waa	I, personally, think you have already answered the question. You have fond memories and bad... carry on with your life, be happy for the moment, look to the future. There are many women out there and there is at least one just right for you.|`|n6IBfiDPaa	She has moved on with someone else, so you should you.<br>  Once you have been to a certain point with somone, and you break up, you cant be friends. There is way too much drama<br>  It sounds like she is missing you, and she is unsure what she wants. If she is with somone else, she really shouldnt be talking to you like that.<br>  You are not going to be able to move on, until you cut her out of your life.<br>  I understand that you still care about her, but thats also the problem.<br>  If you are still friends with her, then she is going to get very jealous when you do start seeing someone else, and it will probably end up with you fighting with her. It could also damage the relationship with the new girl.<br>  I dont think its a good idea to be friends with her. You dont have to be down right mean or anything but let her know that you need to get on with your life and you cant do that when she keeps popping back into it saying those things.|`|IaMByOjFaa	Well you know she still has feeling or else she wouldn't be asking if you miss her.  So if you guys stayed in contact it would hurt your friendship to see each other with someone else.|`|QI11kXKNaa	Tell her to get lost. Better yet, tell her nothing at all. Change your cell number, your IM address, whatever. For this chick to do what she did is the lowest of the low. From what I gather from your all of your questions, she had this guy in mind while you two were together. So the next time she calls, give her the coldest, most brutal rejection you can muster. If that's too hard, then just change all of your numbers and vanish on her. I don't maintain friendships with ANY of my exes, and neither should you. It's a pain in the rear, and jealously and suspicion runs rampant. So do yourself a favor, either tell her off or vanish from her contacts. You'll be glad you did. Oh, and have great fun in college with all those gorgeous ladies.
ChmuSKpVaa	get her a gift card from her fav. store at the mall.... or if she likes twilight, it is suppost to come out in early march if you can wait that long. lol, good luck.|`|5WiMATg2aa	jewelery/perfume/gift set/gift voucher for somewhere like river island or topshop or just some clothes from a nice shop.|`|A6CuFmBtaa	SHOES :)      ...every girl loves shoes!|`|ymWkGqm7aa	A nice bracelet or necklace? Something from Claire's Accessories? A gift voucher for New Look? :)|`|LoMzPHIHaa	jewellery, voucher (impersonal I know but at least you don't buy the wrong thing), ask her what she wants
p75ZEmjXaa	If you want to be with someone else, you should tell your husband.  If you don't have anyone else in mind, just tell your husband you have been feeling a need for space.  Who knows, you might end up falling in love with your husband eventually.<br>  <br>  I appreciated reading your question because I think that is how my wife feels about me.  When we married she was 33 so she had lots of previous lovers and was probably feeling at the end of the road.  She acted like she loved me... then after a year of marriage we had a kid, then another, and she has basically been cold since then.<br>  <br>  Your question is a tough one.  Personally if my wife really feels the same way, I'd rather just keep going the way it is.  I don't want a divorce, I like our family, and I like my wife.  We would probably need to see other people and have activities on the side.  I'd actually rather not ask her about outside lovers until it actually happened.  For all I know, I'd never meet anyone to have an affair anyway so why cause trouble with the hypothetical discussion.|`|asxqampCaa	So you never got over some guy who nailed you first, then you married the guy who could support you financially and father good children.<br>  <br>  You are a user, a liar, and a betrayer.<br>  <br>  Stop painting yourself as the victim - you have wasted the best year's of some good man's life.<br>  <br>  I think there's a term for what you do - oh yeah I remember it now - <br>  <br>  conniving manipulative b*tch.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Love is not passion; don't confuse the two. Life is full of the mundane and how you deal with it says a lot about you. To expect that you  will always want to hump like teenagers is unrealistic. That is passion. Love is much deeper. Think about your life without him, better or worse? <br>  <br>  Lack of passion is not the lack of love.....indifference is the lack of love.|`|mCM363I9aa	so what? if he's a good husband & father I wouldn't worry about love.<br>  You may find "love" with an abusive man who becomes a bad stepfather to your children. If you have a good man by your side, find a way to love him.<br>  <br>  My mom left my dad (good man, good husband) for a man who would come home drunk and hit her in front of us. There is a lot more to that but I'm too ashamed to say it.<br>  <br>  I must also mention that my brother became so traumatized by mom's new life that he won't commit to anyone and is an alcoholic.|`|ceeade679167ec316fc6cfc5f38dcb7baa	Do you know what love is? Do you watch to many movies? Love is not always full of passion. I am guessing you have been with him for 7 to 10 years. You are getting that itch. Scratch it and then go back to him for the rest of your life. You will realize that love is more then passion.|`|nnKGREvVaa	i think you are very sad news, and i dont want even to imagine wat your kids are going to go through because of your slutish ways, let alone the poor guy, u are such a disgrace and i can tell you i was about to fall in the same trap your husband is in- cAN U TRY GOING TO CHURCH????|`|4JrDGW7Taa	So you are not "in love!" Please read the following:<br>  <br>  Is There Such a Thing as ‚ÄúFalling in Love?‚Äù <br>  It was many hundreds of years ago, in the Middle Ages that minstrels and troubadours first crooned about "falling in love." Today, their notion of "falling in love" is being propagated by Hollywood and the media. Let me assure you that there is no such thing as "falling in love." When we become intimate with another human being, we set conditions. I find the notion of "falling in love" not only totally false but also, by those who believe in it, a detriment to a successful relationship. For reality is much more obstinate and trying. <br>  <br>  Let's talk about the real conditions of a relationship. Caring for each other, enjoying a healthy bond similar to friendship, will help meld two lives together and create a primary bond. Then there is intimacy, the sharing of something of a private nature with another human being that gives one a sense of belonging, and will help make us feel more secure. But more than anything, it is our willingness to compromise, to make adjustment to conflicting interests and needs, that is a "must quality" to a successful relationship.|`|AA10097443	Well... Your heart belongs to he who holds the torch. But remember.. all people war with in them self's about love relationships.. You talk about being happy...you are happy... when you look into your children's eyes do you get watery eyed and feel up with emotions..i bet YES.. what you see is both of you and your husbands hard work day in and day out..providing..Now the matters of the heart  only you can control that..As my Grandmother always said: Each tub must sit on its own bottom. Tell him..why to hurt him.. when you hurt him you hurt your kids..You have made your bed..and IT IS NOT GREENER ON THE OTHER SIDE. sorry i am straight forward..:D Smile love comes to those who wait!.|`|H3WHxCgaaa	If you want the love fires to stay burning - you have to stoke them...Nobody retains that teenage, in-love, passion in their relationship forever.  It's a farce!  You can have passionate moments, love your spouse and feel giddy from time-to-time...but it just won't be like that every day.  Life gets in the way!  You buy a house, you have kids, you work...the marriage gets pushed off.  The passion gets pushed off.<br>  <br>  I think that you should try some date nights; a trip away (without the kids!!!) - start to spice things up in your marriage!  If you guys don't do it - nobody will!  Before you have the final curtain call - give it another try.  You were in love with him when you married - you may have to dig deep - but you can get it back...<br>  <br>  Add:  Try watching "The Story of Us" - you may understand the point I'm trying to make here in a better way.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	Someone from your past?<br>  <br>  If they are in your past, how do you know things haven't changed. In fact, like it or not they have changed.<br>  <br>  Like it or not, that teary-eyed passion comes and goes in fits and spurts. It is one of those challenges that marriage is always presenting.<br>  <br>  I think you are in love with your husband, I think once you "lost" him, you would probably feel even worse.<br>  <br>  But ultimately you have a question to ask yourself: "should I stay or should I go?"<br>  <br>  Either decision affects your children's lives, your life, your husband's life. Either decision can have both positive and negative outcomes.<br>  <br>  So you have to consider those outcomes, consider what are you willing to live with.<br>  <br>  I've never been a propponent of staying together for the kids, but real marriage is work. Real marriage means staying together for the entire family's sake.<br>  <br>  Because even divorced, you are still family. You just aren't a very nice family.|`|N5v2j6hPaa	Do you really want to break up a family and aleave a wonderful man that cares so much for you?  do you think I get all watery eyed and feel tons of emotions every time i look at my hubby of 20 plus years.. lol...that's only in harlequin romances lol...<br>  <br>  .... Being in love is a choice.  (oh i will hear different...but think back to prearranged marriages)....You can make yourself fall in love with this man.   <br>  <br>   If you want to do a test....why dont you picture the whole divorce thing....the splitting everything ....telling the children, daddy will see you on the weekends...etc...<br>  eventually your hubby will find another woman that he is just as crazy about. and yes this will happen...  dont think he will pine the rest of his life for you....not being mean just stating a fact....<br>  <br>  the marriage wont work if you don't work it together...|`|pJJyH3vhaa	I'm so tired of hearing this BS "I love him but I'm not in love with him". WTF is that supposed to mean? You either love a person or you don't. There's no in-between. Men don't say confusing, illogical stuff like that, so why do women use this line?<br>  <br>  As for your ex-b/f who carries your torch, forget about him. It's the past.|`|HYbmegQraa	As a Man I understand what you're saying, you can love someone but not be IN Love with someone.<br>  <br>  You have to think very seriously about what to do if there is no Love in your marriage whatsoever then you have to then think about your children and the Love for them.<br>  <br>  I wish you all the best.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Yes I fully understand what you are saying, I too have got married only loving someone and thats not a good reason for a lifelong commitment, I could not respond to him in the way he wanted me to and so we had a break down that lead to me divorcing him.<br>  We are still friends because of our daughter but I have truly fallen "in love" and am getting married in June to a man that has shown me what love means.<br>  I get all the highs of passion with my man, I miss him even when we are together as I know he will have to go soon, he is truly my soul mate and when I look into his eyes I see me.<br>  You are stopping yourself experience true love by staying with this man, however much you love him you are not in love and as you so rightly say there is a world of difference.<br>  Your children will adapt whatever happens in their lives, your husband sounds like a good man and will be there to support his kids, you need to get out and have your life as contrary to popular belief it does not ALL revolve around the children, you have a right to a life too as long as it doesn't affect them.<br>  Divorce, find your love and be happy we are only on earth once and its not a rehearsal so make each day count.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	Whaaat? If you want to know the secret of marriage, it's this: love is a CHOICE. And you already say several times that you "love him very much" but you aren't "in love" with him. Come on now.. That's baloney. In my opinion it would be ridiculous of you to divorce him. But I know a lot of people will say "life is short. move on." etc... <br>  <br>  I think you will be making a big mistake if you divorce a perfectly good man who you LOVE, and is the father of your children, for no real reason. Married people seldom get teary eyed every time they look at their spouse. I'm not saying it doesn't happen, but married life gets boring for everyone sometimes. You think every married couple "feels the love" ALL the time for each other? Then you are living in a dream world. Your poor husband. <br>  <br>  Get marital counseling and figure out what's really wrong in your relationship.
lvOR401haa	Yikes - this love thing is hard isn't it?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't tell her anything more for the following reason:<br>  <br>  I myself was the one to send a similar message to a friend of mine, who I had realised liked me and I didn't see him more than just my good friend.  Knowing he was shy and easily embarrassed, I gently let him know that I loved him as a friend before he said anything to me.  It wasn't for my benefit, but his.  <br>  <br>  I am not saying your friend did this for the same reason as I did, but to tell a guy that you love him like a brother is quite clear - it means she dosn't like you in THAT way.  <br>  <br>  Some could say that she said it because she wanted you to respond and confess undying love, but I would have never told a guy I liked I loved him like a brother.<br>  <br>  Now, it's up to you.  You can tell her and risk the friendship collapsing to take the chance on her giving you a chance.<br>  <br>  OR<br>  <br>  You can kept it to yourself and stay friends with her.  <br>  <br>  It will all depend on how much her friendship means to you, and whether you can handle not being with her as a bf, seeing her date and all that.<br>  <br>  If you feel unable to stay her friend, then perhaps tell her why by explaining that you love her like THAT and that it's too hard for you to be around her for now because of what she said.<br>  <br>  It's a hard situation no matter what, so I send my warmest best wishes your way and hope it's all good in the end
IWKnavZsaa	you haven't talked to him in two months... did you think he was going to wait for you!?|`|0gQzs5t2aa	he was obviously looking for a bit of fun! was he drunk ?

LJ2OqF1saa	I would ask him why he is contacting you now.  It is not up to you to help him.  Once you find out why he is contacting you now, 1 month b4 the wedding, then you move from there.  <br>  <br>  Being first love does not mean that this is the guy for you, sure you have a history, and now a child together, but he left the 2 of you, and moved on and lived his own life.  It may be that he is looking to spend time with the child, or possible seek custody.....so be very careful.   Don't sleep with him.....because how would you feel if it were done to you, by this I mean....if you were the woman that he was going to marry, and the guy went out for one last lay with someone he has had a long history with.  I would keep whatever conversations with him....simple and platonic|`|l8Q3n8WUaa	girl just leave him alone!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! he wasn't there for ur child so why should u be there for him now dat hes getting married?!?! screw him n just forget about him!!

Sounds to me like you did the typical young lady approach and jumped in with both feet and your whole heart headfirst and now that you have grown and matured some your feelings have evolved too.  Follow your own advice and walk away. You are not wrong and he's not perfect--don't doubt your own instincts (they will get you through life and they are never wrong) and remember there is no such thing as a perfect man (or woman for that matter). Be honest and straight forward about how you feel, be very clear--first with yourself then with him. Let him know that you value you're time together and will treasure it but this is just not for you anymore. Let him know this not a "need some space then come back later" thing--be kind but firm. You will respect yourself for it in the long run and so will he. Afterward take time for you to heal and deal with all of the natural emotions; don't jump into another relationship anytime soon.  You mentioned wanting other guys--sounds like you need to date around but not commit to one person.  Be very clear with prospective gents so they don't get the wrong idea. Put yourself first and foremost,  once you've figured out how to do that then you will be better prepared for a true adult commitment quality relationship--it's about balancing give and take.  True love is about helping each other achieve what you want as individuals through supporting one another unconditionally then you are both more apt to be supportive of the relationship.  If you do all the giving and he does all the taking then the tables turn (which is what it sounds like has been happening) that's not likely to change--instead you will burn out and become bitter and miserable. You can;t make yourself feel something that isn't there,  what your wanting is out there somewhere...it just hasn't come your way yet and won't/can't until you are free to find it...  Good Luck and take care!!!
AA11121801	Any people who are more lustful than loving will find marriage to be binding. But marriage is for people who love each other so much that even after no sex, they still treasure each other's presence, support, care and love.<br>  <br>  Lust can go off anytime--after all does the guy think he can do it 24/7 all his life? At some point whether its same woman or different women, he will get tired of lust and want some companionship. That's what marriage provides--love, care, companionship, romance, and sex too.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	That guy is an idiot, and will probably never have a lasting and fulfilling relationship.<br>  <br>  What that guy is talking about is "lust", not love.<br>  <br>  The spark and excitement can still be there, but you have to be wiling to put the effort into it.  Granted, I've only been married nearly 5 years, but I still get butterflies in my stomach when I'm about to see him after work.  I still get tingly when he kisses me.<br>  <br>  It's about something deeper than "lust", it's about true love.  It's about finding the person who is your other half in every way.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	the guy said that because he wants to keep playing around and isnt ready to commit.... marriage is a commitment to being with someone because you want to... not just for sex or excitment... its a promise to always be there good times and bad|`|y4SUDnpaaa	News Flash.....not all marriages are like that. You can have the kind of marriage you want and deserve if you are willing to put the work needed into it and make it your priority. What would you and your friend suggest as an alternative? A series of short relationships that end as soon as the spark  and excitement of sex is gone.The intensity of sex with a new partner always wanes after some time is passed. That is expected in people mature enough to be married. You replace that excitement and intensity into building a home. You don't give up on good sex you just find ways to keep it fresh. The happiness of sharing your life with someone you love, sharing goals, trust and feeling safe  gives your sex life a much greater intimacy, openness and satisfaction.I've been married 20 years and there have been many times I've cried after lovemaking because there was such an incredible feeling of closeness, intimacy and love that it overwhelmed me. Beats a short time of excite every time.|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	My marriage is not dull, possibly because I married an intelligent, insightful, and interesting woman.<br>  <br>  You say "only" have sex with her, yes, but the up side is that I have a constant source of available sex, and most single people don't.<br>  <br>  We do exciting things together, but I actually very much like feeling comfortable.  I feel no particular need for drama in my life.<br>  <br>  I don't sleep more than I did 22 years ago, when I married her.  <br>  <br>  What temptation is not there?  If you're saying I don't find my wife sexually tempting, you would be wrong.  If you saw her, you would agree with me.<br>  <br>  I got married for lots of reasons: love, companionship, a partner to have children with, a source of support, friendship, a person to build a life with, etc.
63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	It is hard to describe to people who are unmarried or only married a short time.  But here goes.<br>  <br>  Life is about learning and growing.  It is about choices and dealing with the consequences (good and bad) of our choices.  Life is not about how we look, but who we are.  It's not about finding excitement in life by trying new and better things (sex with different partners, new adventures, etc), but finding excitement and enjoyment in everything you do.<br>  <br>  This all sounds corny, but looks fade as we age and you will run out of the new and the better.  <br>  <br>  Marriage is one of the best and hardest things I have done (along with becoming a mother).  You are forced to learn and grow together and overcome many obstacles.  It is hard work.  But, it is one of the most wonderful things when after you have put in the work (and had lots of fun in the process) you come to a place where you find out how much you cherish and adore your spouse.  You have each others backs and have been in the trenches together.  You have shared all of the joys and sorrows of life together.  There are so many shared memories and the deep love is unbelievable.  No one knows me like my husband.  And the sex is beyond what you can imagine.  Sure, our bodies have changed, things sag, etc.  You would look at me and have unkind thoughts.  I really don't care.  I know who I am, what I have, and I am happy almost all of the time.  I have great sex, a loving home and lots of laughter.  I have learned so much from my wonderful husband and he has learned from me.  I am so much better for having spent time with him.<br>  <br>  That is what can be gained from marriage if both people work at making it a good one.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Well, the guy who said that to you is a loser.  Only lazy slobs let their marriages get to a point like that.  Myself, I love being married and I can't wait to see my husband after work and vise versa.<br>  <br>  Sounds like the guy above put no work into his marriage, and neither did his wife.  It also sounds like they didn't know how to have sex properly!<br>  <br>  Don't let idiots like that color your image of marriage in a bad way.  Marriage is what you make it!  I think it's the most wonderful, fullfilling relationship a person can have.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	You get out of relationships what you put into them. If you work at maintaining interest and freshness and new ideas and experiences, the relationship grows, thrives and is always interesting. If you just maintain the status quo, that is where you will be stuck. <br>  <br>  PS, I have seen much worse english on here!|`|2svonkw1aa	NOOO! the whole point of love is that you want to be with eachother every second of every day. that's the beauty of it. you never get tired of your loved one|`|FnGebaOLaa	lol!<br>  you should not get married to who you are with!<br>  You need to find someone you WANT to sleep w/ forever!<br>  who you WANT  to have sex w/ forever!|`|NLEmQZSsaa	I say the guy who said this to you is an idiot!  Why spend time with a guy who thinks of marriage this way?  Find a guy who wants to live life with you.  Maybe he is talking about his parents and thinks they are bored and unhappy.  Do not waste your time with this guy.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You get married because you WANT to be with that person everyday for the rest of your life, only have sex with them, and are comfortable with each other even if you just want to sleep<br>  <br>  If you don't feel that way about a person, then you shouldn't get married.
7edl5u1oaa	I am waiting as it is very important to me!! Virginity is sacred to me and i want to share it only with my husband!! That's how its supposed to be, in my opinion!|`|2MVG5StDaa	I don't believe there is anything wrong with holding out until marriage.  I actually think that's the way it should be.<br>  <br>  I wished i had done that when i was younger.  The world would be a much better place if everyone would just clean up their act and be sensible in this area.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	Well since I am 44 and never married there was NO WAY I would want to wait.<br>  Can you imagine?  A 44 year old virgin?? LOL!!!<br>  <br>  I think you should have sex so you can see if you are compatible.|`|FzFSzilmaa	i didn't... seems such a waste... :D|`|qw7BmBq6aa	I wish I had, because the other men I had slept with certainly wern't worth my time in the end, and certainly wern't worthy of what I had to offer ;)  it makes me sad at times to know I couldn't give my husband what he deserved (my virginity).|`|O36qjj7Oaa	I didn't wait for marriage to have sex but i did wait until i met the right guy.<br>  <br>  When my husband and i met he was 25 and i was 21 and we were both still virgins and we lost our virginity's together while we were dating.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	This is Marriage and Divorce--I doubt you'll find a lot of V's here.<br>  <br>  If I could do it over again, I would have kept the V card for marriage.
ub2Dtzn0aa	You need to chill out. What is the rush? IF your really in love then you know how special it is to feel that way and your not going to want to leave because your not hearing it back. Would you feel better if he would just say he loves you but not give you the key to his house(showing major trust)? <br>  It sounds like you are acting like its a rebound relationship. Your major concern is getting him to be madly in love with you and thus making you feel wanted and getting the attention you crave. He sounds like he's being honest with you, and if you read some of these questions you'll see thats a lot harder to find than someone to tell you they love you to get in your panties. <br>  The time between your last relationship means less than how serious that relationship was, how intense it was, the factors that lead to its ending and what you did since that ended. You may very well be in rebound mode and your fortunate to be with a guy that isnt taking advantage of that and seems to really care about you. He's thinking for the both of you right now, step back, cut him some slack. The only foolish thing you can do right now is pressure him to lie about his feelings in order to satisfy your ego. Your love is not unconditional at this point so its not really love is it? You only will love him if he agrees to love you? Thats not what love's about, and you know this. Control yourself and enjoy the present moment and the future will take care of itself.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Just talk to him about it and be COMPLETELY HONEST about how you feel. Don't hold anything back. Let him know that if he doesn't care about you as much as you care about him then you're gonna have to let him go because you DESERVE someone who feels the same about you and will treat you with the same love and respect.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	He's not in love.<br>  <br>  He's too chicken to confront you about it and end it. It might have something to do with sex, but more to do with the point that he doesn't want to be alone. He's given you his key, which usually indicates a specific level of intimacy and love. But here, I think he just doesn't want to be alone--that is his greatest fear, and as long as you are around, he doesn't have to face that fear...ever.<br>  <br>  Give him his key back, give him a clean, healthy break. Both of you go find yourselves someone to love who'll love you.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Do you do more than have sex? Do you go out and have fun together? Has he introduced you to his friends or any family? <br>  <br>  Cut back on the sex and see if he still hangs around.....
BaNrweQ4aa	falling out with your best friends is just literally the worst. you need to give us details about what the fight was about and why they won't talk to you. try talking to your best friend - and asking what's wrong and apologising for what/if anything you have done wrong. your best friends can't stay mad at you - because they are your best friends. just ringing them? texting? just really try and get to the bottom of the problem and talking things over is usually the best way to solve things. if it's a silly little squabble; just let it pass over and all will be ok. if you think it's more than that - keep trying. try really hard - after all.. they're just best friends aren't they :) good luck and tell us what happens :D|`|1HLPznZhaa	Sounds like a cat fight , something peculiar with girls..What was the fight about ?

WyCmQBuvaa	Yes all of the above.<br>  <br>   Request it with the court. If uncontested, it should be granted 6 -8 wks.   You will need to send a copy to every agency.  Each agency has it's own procedures and forms.<br>  Birth Certificate - State where you live<br>  Social Security <br>  Bank Accounts<br>  Insurance - Life, Health - doctors, hospitals, where he got his shots<br>  Wills or Living Trusts<br>  <br>  Any legal document with his name on it.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	This is strictly your business to make your own decision..so whatever you decide to do..go through court..since you change your child's name..then you need to change the name of all paperwork..showing the court ordered name change as proof that the child's name was legally changed through the courts.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	I think you need to change it with the social security office first.  You should be able to find all of this information on the internet.  Your state government should have a website on what to do.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Social Security and on his birth certificate.<br>  <br>  Since he is less than two those are the only two legal, identifying documents he has.<br>  <br>  Then you can change it with your health insurance just to make sure that everything gets paid right.
rQ7dI88Maa	If he's going to get upset either way, don't tell him at all.|`|IPS3hWweaa	Don't tell him at all. Why bring any additional drama on yourself. What a whacko.|`|AA12261142	if u have custody it is really none of his business  if u get your kid baptized|`|mCM363I9aa	you will only make your situation worst between you and him, if you really want to have your son baptized why don't you wait until he is old enough to decide on his own. Keep the peace between you and your ex for the sake of your child.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Tell him after...you have sole custody, so you can do whatever you want.|`|GQUaFGHLaa	If your ex is a trouble maker then don't tell him anything at all. Keep it to yourself.|`|0ulKsvXlaa	Why do you need to tell him ?<br>  What they eye doesn't see, the heart doesn't bleed over !|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Sounds more like a dedication than a baptism, as it is a more grown up decision for one to be baptized.  Anyway, Since you have sole and legal physical custody.....then do it.....you don't have to tell him. I would not want him there causing a scene in such a place as a church.  Just do it and don't tell him nothing, he does not control you or the child, this is why you have legal possession of the child.|`|MVnGhbi1aa	Even with sole custody, he is still your son's father.<br>  <br>  The minimum amount of respect he deserves is to know what is going on in his son's life.<br>  <br>  He might be against it, but it is still a huge event in your son's life. Imagine not just the hurt he feels from his wishes being denies, but also the chance to witness it.<br>  <br>  Minimize that hurt. Invite him to the baptism. Invite him to be a part of it. If he refuses, then it is all his fault. You gave him a chance. At least give him that.|`|4DDSD9Syaa	I wouldn't tell him, what difference would it make. You have sole and physical custody. Or if you want tell him afterwards.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	There's no point in baptizing a baby, he doesn't understand.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	I'd tell him after. Don't let him make a scene. If he wants to take you to court over it, I'd laugh in his face!|`|ndQkhqZeaa	At this point you don't even need to mention it.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Well, I think it's wrong to baptise a child too.  It's forcing religion on them.  You should really wait until the child can make the choice for themself.  Being baptised is the public display of your belief in your religion, stating "I BELIEVE IN GOD!" if your child is only 20 months old, they have no idea what religion is.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend you wait and educate the child as you raise them, then let them decide if they want to be baptised.<br>  <br>  For all you voting thumbs down on my statement, you're crazy.  It states clearly in the bible people only became baptised once they believed.  The child is clearly not at a level where they could believe in Jesus and the sacrifice he made for all of us.<br>  <br>  Most churches that are smart won't baptise kids until they are ATLEAST 7, and even then they prefer the age to be 10-12.<br>  <br>  You should tell him before, it's not like you reproduced all on your own, he has a right to know.  He may even want to attend the baptism he may surprise you.|`|Zl6BTG30aa	The first thing you have to do is make sure that your ex is not abusive. If he is, either way you'll be in trouble. If he is, see if you can get a restraining order, that way he can't go near you. Then, it wouldn't matter if you told him before or after. hope this was helpful =)|`|tLuALLwQaa	By not telling him you tell him you fear him he is your son so if you want him baptised do it tell him your going to do it invite him with the rest of your family chances are he wont show anyway but by keeping it from him you are saying I am scared of you dont say that. good luck|`|TZpFcx47aa	Dont tell him at all.

Hes not lasting as long. so essentially. in the beginning, awesome sex, hot passionate.. later its more for his benefit than yours.  Imagine if every time you had sex he came and you didn't.. I don't know about you but after a while I wouldn't be as interested. It also has alot to do with resentment and kids. It doesnt always last forever, just a short or long spell.<br>  <br>  <br>  Why are you asking by the way. are you a home wrecker cause you sound like one.|`|AA10097443	Lets face it..women are complex and so are men..with that said.. people bore easy..if a women gets bored..she shuts the sex program down...I have found that its like a flower don't water it don't give it light..the next thing you know..it dies.

The women who say they don't enjoy sex are NOT the same women complaining that their husbands aren't into them...<br>  <br>  The truth is that humans, in general, must choose to be happy, because most of us do not naturally possess the ability.  SInce you wish to generalize women, I'll say that women, in particular, are "worry warts" and we tend to get something into our heads and have a very difficult time shaking lose of it until it is "resolved."<br>  <br>  Men, in general, are not well-equipped by nature to deal with women on this level...|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I am married, and I love having sex with my husband.|`|LMIbr1aeaa	I am married to a woman.

In my opinion, as I've given it a lot of thought over the years, is that wives resent husbands (just as husbands resent wives) for little things and they have something that men really like and want, so....why not withhold it.  Well, after a while....they just don't care anymore...don't want to be bothered.  Oh, and when you don't care anymore and are "doing it"....it's pretty gross actually...all that huffing and puffing and moaning and groaning...it all starts with the woman making sure that the man isn't going to be enjoying what she's got.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	What woman says she wants to have sex, then says she doesn't?

So by the time we have a second to ourselves we just want to sleep.  But we are always hugging and kissing and it is a great thing.  I am actually planning a surprise get away weekend that he knows nothing about just so I can give him the special attention he needs.  <br>  Now I do have a friend that after she had her baby she said she was not attracted to her husband sexually at that time we did not have the 3 month old yet and she was like you understand I was like hell no we are always all over each other.  And she could not understand why but I guess each person is different.  I guess it is a good thing our sex drive is a perfect match but now we just need the time to get it in.  But besides the weekend we said we were going to start planning hooky days were we would take all the kids to school and day care and not go to work and just enjoy each other.  So we will find away to spice it up again.  LOL|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Some people (men or women) will lose all interest in sex when their stress level hits a certain point. In their minds, they will not want to have sex with their partners because they feel some type of emotional disconnect between them and their partners. It could be because he doesn't do enough house chores or because she has gained weight and always watches TV. Whatever it is, some kind of disconnection is the focus of why they do not want sex. In reality, that single issue is simply an excuse used that covers a much larger reason. It is an increased stress level, which has impacted both the person's mind and their physical body. They actually get themselves stuck and locked into a sexless state and feel disturbed, bothered, or irritated if they are pressured to act in a way that is not in accordance with their depressed (and sexless) state of being. It's a very self-defeating act, but it is usually a subconscious thing. Anyone who has ever enjoyed sex knows that having sex again or even masturbating can make them feel better. Why would they not want to do something that will likely make them feel better? It's just something that happens when one gets stuck in a rutt. It can happen to a lot of people. Of course there are others who work the opposite way. When they get more stressed, they feel the need for more and more sex to relieve the tension and anxiety they feel. They crave the release and focus on it more than usual. There's a lot of things that we as humans do that don't exactly make sense, but we still do them and many times do not even realize what we are doing or why we do it.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	You're confusing two different kinds of women.  They aren't the same women.<br>  <br>  Here is the approximate breakdown of women by category:<br>  10% Like sex and have it all the time, giving and getting, no complains from man or woman<br>  20% Like sex but are stuck with a weird guy who doesn't give it to them, or a man who is tired of the woman's emotionality and is put off by them so much that he can no longer get it up.<br>  50% Could take it or leave it.  They were excited at first when married but then the novelty wore off and they started seeing the man's faults and getting turned off.  So, it takes little favors and effort on the guy's part to get them on again.<br>  20% Don't like sex and/or get satisfaction from blue balling their man.  They really can't be moved in any case, so no matter what the man does, he gets no response and ends up frustrated.
d7bJIgqlaa	My husband and I have been married for 10 months.  We are going to start trying for our first around our 1 year anniversary.  We talked about both wanting kids and that we wanted to travel some first.  However, talk about a timeline before you get married...one that is flexible.

He already has kids but he never got to raise them because he was so young, neither of his were planned.|`|AA10886262	a year after we married, no we didn't discuss it; we divorced 6 years later; I would highly recommend that you DO discuss this before you become engaged or at least before you marry, and I would highly recommend waiting two or three years after getting married before you start a family.........too many adjustments occur just from getting married, and everything changes after you have children.....|`|T4N6a7MQaa	I was married to my second wife for a little more than two years before my son was born.

gYWDrHVFaa	Stay out of it!  Let her boss do the dirty work.|`|nfQhsRvfaa	Just tell her the truth. That you've heard rumours about it but you're not sure if it's true. Then maybe she can at least start looking for another job and get one lined up before she's drowning in bills she can't pay after getting laid off suddenly. I would hope my friend or coworker would tellme if something like that were going to happen. It's compassionate and helpful.|`|6487bd61ef059cac042d49119a814a4aaa	Don't tell.  The messenger is always the one who gets shot.  Besides, maybe it actually is a rumor.  Stay out of it.|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Not your place to tell her......do not spread rumors!|`|djUMvICoaa	I think you're better off on this one not saying anything.  If it's wrong, how will you feel?  What will it change if you do tell her?  Even if it's true, tell it like it is if she finds out you knew, you didn't want to pass along anything you weren't sure of.  And that seems to be the case here.|`|8xGUGVHkaa	Let her manager tell her. If something happen that you don't know like they decided to keep her then you could lose your job.|`|tdulyzXXaa	I can imagine how you feel. But you have no idea how she may react so it's best that you don't jeopardize your own job by telling her.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	Just tell her you heard it, but wasn't sure if it were actually true or not. That way she can get a head start with looking for another job. I'd want to know if everyone else knew but me.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Keep it to yourself.  You heard it through the grapevine?  Where I come from, that's called a rumour, and you don't upset someone unnecessarily over a rumour.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	Don't tell the DOLT anything. She just may blame you and include you in the ROARING GUN SMOKE that's going to be laid down on her last day.
1JBf1vRMaa	well i see your problem ..<br>  i have to say that nothing is wrong with you hun..<br>  all that is going on is that you have basiclly been waiting for your mr.wright .. which is the best thing to do..<br>  you shouldnt feel left out by not having a boyfriend straight away ..<br>  i think there is some one out there for everyone but you just havnt found yours yet..<br>  and when you find him dont let him go !|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	Nothing's wrong with you, you're just confused and lonely.  Instead of finding cheap and meaningless sex to affirm who you are, try picking up another activity to build your confidence like a sport or club!  Identify yourself, give yourself worth, and then when you can value yourself other people will too!   Building confidence takes work, but you're worth it, and you'll be awesome when you get through this!|`|KsPbIxq1aa	i think you just have a few insecurities. i don't think you have to have a boyfriend but i also don't think you have to have sex with a guy to make yourself feel better. i also think it has to do with being played by guys. i think maybe if you try to find something you like and your good at to distract you and take up your time maybe that will help. it's hard to answer a question like this because i don't really know you, but i hope i have somewhat helped. sorry if it didn't.|`|FR1SoLteaa	I know your feelings, I am 21, never had a girlfriend.<br>  Sex is sex, it brings people together, but people use for other things. <br>  Your not a whore, your lonely and don't know how to take care of it.<br>  Do things that you like to do, hopefully you will find somebody.|`|AA12110937	list of things that maybe be wrong:<br>  1.your not over your previous relationship<br>  2.you have low self esteem<br>  3.you want commitment from a guy<br>  4.you have nothing going on in your life right now that intrests you<br>  5.or...your just plain horny!<br>  pick whatever it is and work on it..<br>  (ps dont take life so seriously...)|`|m84Ml3Opaa	First of all there are alot of men out there that just want to hit it and quit it. From what I'm reading you may need to work on your self-esteem issues. I was the same way for a long while. Feeling like sex would make someone want me. But I find that the girls who are the easiest to get in bed are the one's men never get serious about. Most men want something they have to work for. Don't do things you'll be ashamed of in the morning. Sex will never be the way to win someone over. Respect for you and your body is what you need to start with. Men have started wars over women, so obviously its something you just shouldn't give away.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	You need to see a counselor, to get to the root of your problem. They can help explore why you feel that way, and then help you make it better.<br>  <br>  Your behavior is very dangerous, you could get any number of nasty STDs, some of which can make you sterile, some of which are incurable, and one that is fatal. You could get pregnant. You could be raped or beaten.<br>  <br>  Please seek help soon, before something terrible happens to you.|`|rV1uAtt3aa	Many times when people don't feel they received the supportive, accepting love they wanted from their parents, they substitute physical love for emotional love.  In essence, they are seeking approval/love through sex.<br>  <br>  I suggest you see a counselor to get to the root of these issues so that you will be able to find a healthy relationship in your future.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|AA11447210	Sounds like you're rather insecure. You've got to learn to love yourself before you can expect anyone else to.<br>  <br>  Understand your self worth and don't have sex with people for them to provide you with fake emotion...have it if you are responsible and want to have it. Not because for a little while you feel wanted (when that may not be the case)...and stay away from cheaters. Bad karma on you and them.|`|50245e5074843d3b781e05bd05ac05baaa	you just need to learn to be happy with yourself. Until you do that the cycle will just repeat. You can't really rely on others to make you happy if you are not happy by yourself.|`|RKw56KZaaa	You're awesome. The world needs more girls like you.|`|RZl7aPxnaa	you do this as you said, you are lonely. you feel as if this would be love, but it is not love. you should try and change the way you are doing even if it may be hard to do. that is if you want to really find a guy that you will really love. do not sleep with them, if you hold back as to get to know them and let them get to know you as this way he will begin to have feelings for you as to also show you respect as time he will then love you as you will also love him. but to just sleep with a guy will never bring you love, for once you have done this, they will then be gone. as this way you will only get a taste of what love can be. you must learn to say no, even if you do not want too. but think of your future, do you not want this love to stay with you from now own. and not just get a taste of what it could be. you need to change your ways, as to take time and do not rush anything for this way you can let love build up in both of you. and in time could be something for life not just sex, but as two people that love each other and will always be together. but this must be your choice, or it will not work out.
p7Z5H8ftaa	yeah some guys like shyness. the only thing annoying about shy people is their normally too self consious to have a normal conversation with and it gets awkward. so long as your not the awkward type hell yeah you guys just wont be having kinky sex very soon|`|AA11447210	Yes...you may like them but your shyness may cause them to feel otherwise and they may not feel the chemistry toward you because of that (if you are aloof and withdrawn).<br>  <br>  Being a shy person myself, I can tell you it can be a hindrance. However with some people I'm very relaxed and at ease right off the bat...if that doesn't occur, even if I'm attracted to that person, chances are we wouldn't be a good match in the long run.|`|37ana68Haa	yea dont be shy lifes to short to be shy i learned that the hard way just be confident you are who you are and there is no changing it so just be you and stop being shy|`|5es7ct2Baa	yes|`|VWDYRlV0aa	yip|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	yes, but if it is there, it will come out on its own :)|`|OGkPeww1aa	To a degree yes. If you start shy and become confident that may be an enormous aid. It will show you had the courage to get over it, and you were interested enough to reach out. Now if you can not even talk to someone, theres no chance to even have chemistry unless she is like the same way......In the end, if you are too shy, force yourself to talk, and you will become comfortable with that person.|`|wrHh16tcaa	yes, it can. Sometimes shyness can give off the impression that you are not intrested and you want them to back off. It also depends how the person takes it, other times shyness can make the realtionship interesting because it gives a mysterious vibe. Some shyness is good but be careful to not over do it.:D|`|jztZxJ5paa	well i don't abought all of that but i do now if you realy like someone you shouldn't be shy  you should tell the pearson how you feall|`|QFrjFl1uaa	You can not create chemistry, it's eigther there or it isn't...just be who you are, once you are comfortable with yourself you will natuarally come out of your shell and spark some chemistry ;)
a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	The decision has been made, if they are not happy about it that's too bad. You can start with, "Fiance tell me you were aksing about brinigng the baby to the wedding. I just wanted to let you know that our decision stands. We would love to have you there but unfortunately was cannot and will not accomodate the baby. We hope you can find a suitable sitter by then." If they don't come, it's their loss, not yours. Stick to your guns!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|mvKDbb2uaa	Oh man!  I'm so sorry.<br>  <br>  You will have to unfortunately open up this subject.  Tell them that your decision stands that this will be an adult's only reception.  Although you love *baby,* you both (you and your fiance) have already decided on this.  You would like all to have a good time and give parents a night out as well without the kids.  <br>  <br>  My advice though is to NOT have them bring the baby for pictures.  I say this because it weakens your argument a little bit and ultimately you may find yourself at your reception with the baby in the corner anyway because by allowing them to bring the baby along for pictures is almost like saying "I don't want to have kids at my reception, but bring him to pictures and we'll see."|`|hkwBR1moaa	Having an adult only wedding and reception is fine.  My only arguement would be, if you don't want him at the ceremony, then why are you having the baby brought for pictures.  That's like saying we want your child to be in my picture but don't want him taking part in anything else.  That would upset me.|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Sad as it is, if it's your decision, stick to it, and just tell them again.<br>  Does your fiance really not want his sister there? I think that's quite odd.|`|w1necKzYaa	You made the decision to have no babies at the wedding you knew that peopl would be pissed too damn bad now deal with it!|`|AA11380378	Plain and simple:<br>  <br>  Tell them that the issue has already been discussed and that there will be no negotiation in the matter anymore. Tell them that you have been very clear about it and want this issue to be put to rest once and for all. Tell them that no exception will be made as they are many people in the same situation that everyone has been more than happy to comply, be cooperative and respectful. Tell them that you cannot invite just one and not invite the 20 other children from the other couple's. Tell them that if they wish to stay at home, that's their choice as you will carry on as planned. Tell them that you will not take their emotional blackmail anymore. Tell them that this is nothing personal and they are making it personal.<br>  <br>  PUT YOUR FOOT DOWN! You are right. Do not give in!<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	1.  this is your wedding.  if you want it adults only, then it's adults only.  If someone refuses to show because of this then--oh well, too bad, so sad, you will miss them but the wedding will go on EVEN IF it's someone you bent over backwards for at their wedding, EVEN IF that someone is a member of your wedding party, EVEN IF that someone has blood ties to one of the pair of  you getting married that day.<br>  <br>  2.  His family is handling this exactly correctly.  HE is the one they should approach about having the baby there NOT YOU.  HE is the one who should continue to tell them "no children, adults only."  NOT YOU.  You do not open your mouth on this subject to them unless and until one of them speaks to you about it.  <br>  <br>  3.  And this is also a lesson to you on how to deal with ticklish family issues in the future.  HE handles HIS side of the family and YOU handle YOUR side.  When HE tells HIS family something the two of you have agreed on then the message is coming from HIM that the two of you are united.  This isn't a whim on your part.  The same goes when you are dealing with your family.  When the message comes from your spouse then your spouse is controlling you from your family's perspective.  When the message comes directly from you then they still might not be happy about it but you delivering the message to your own family says that you and your spouse are united and in agreement.|`|cGbTJobeaa	Sounds like the sis is working her manipulations on mom and dad.<br>  <br>  I think it is fine to have an adult only reception.  When we got married, we had an adult only reception and the ceremony was open to everyone.  About 5 or 6 couples brought their children (including out of town guests) and arranged for babysitting during the reception.  We have some awesome family photos on the altar of my whole side of the family...including the children.  One of my favorite pictures is one of me sititing on the altar with what is affectionately referred to as "the third generation".  The parents were all fine with this...they were just happy that I was open to their kids to attending the ceremony.<br>  <br>  Let me guess....was your in-laws reception adults only? Are they the types who were understanding of "adults only" and then became militant "my baby goes everywhere with me" types once they had kids?<br>  <br>  You're already paying for their babysitter. So, the baby will be taken back home and be with someone they know and trust.  I think that is sufficient.  Tell your fiance to stay strong!|`|crxbob5jaa	"[Mom and Dad], I know you guys are having trouble understanding our reason for having no babies at our wedding. And I know that [Fiance] has talked to you about it. But I feel like it's only fair that I explain what is going on.<br>  <br>  I love [Baby Johnny] so much. He's the sweetest ever. But I also realize that a wedding is an adult occasion and is sacred. A small child doesn't understand the significance. He's only there because his parents brought him. It means nothing to him. And child shouldn't be expected to behave like adults because they are not adults. He will be happier & safe if he's allowed to play someplace else. And the rest of us can enjoy the wedding. <br>  <br>  There is a time and place for everything. And when we have a baby, I want you to remind me how I feel right now so I will respect other weddings. I just ask for your understanding. Thanks"<br>  <br>  <br>  Heck, I'd write both the parents and the baby's parents a note explaining it and sign your name. If your fiance would let you since it's his family. Maybe a note from you would cause them to realize they will have to discuss this with you instead of the usual way they seem to have to bullying him. It might work.|`|zmqN0M86aa	Yes, put your foot down.  Everyone else is complying with your request, right?  It wouldn't be fair to them if you made an exception for your fiance's sister.  You know what happens when you make exceptions.  Another person will find out and asks you, "you're letting so and so do it, why can't I?" and before you know it, everyone will be bringing their baby.<br>  <br>  Tell them what you said in your question that the decision has been made and is non negotiable.  They don't have to come if they don't want to.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I went back and read one of the first questions you asked about this.  I just have to say that the part where you said your fiance's sister was whining about how she was going to explain to your future nephew that he wasn't at the wedding cracked me up.  Babies don't know what the **** is going on.  Like he's going to care whether or not he attended a wedding that he would have absolutely no recollection of, LOLOL.|`|znq808AKaa	This is YOUR wedding! And your decision should be respected! Wait till it is brought up again - believe me it will be - but let them say the firts thing about it. Then firmly but politely say "It is not debatable, the desision of NO BABIES have been made and we would like you to respect that." That is all you say. Don't say ANYTHING more about the topic. Stick to your chioce!
lemCTR2Waa	Rely on your intuition in choosing the right friends. Your network of people around you are good sources of information about others as well. Value their thoughts and opinions, you will be surprised how diverse theirs can be but in the end you will deicde which one to believe.

Hope i helped! =0)|`|oTIG31j2aa	you need to know if they will be there for you if you needed them and if they helping you in getting what you want and if they believe in your ability and if they making excuses if you herd them once|`|8eQLNUzWaa	its easy best frd means when ur doing wrong they will give one slap and they want to change u they want to be with u they want to share there valuable moments with u

What's good for the goose is good for the gander.  It isn't fair for a female to be judged in that way anymore.  life is short and she is feeling it equally llike you are, then seize the moment.  <br>  <br>  Besides, maybe she wouldn't be easily persuaded by just any ole man..maybe there truly is chemistry with you and her "easiness" for lack of a better word is simply just a one time thing because it feels so right with you.  Ya never know!|`|X8n4Qnkeaa	wow. a little judgmental aren't you? how bout you stop trying to take her to bed if you're so turned off by a girl who you love wanting to sleep with you?|`|VXQFT341aa	Not when im with her. I would be worried when she isnt around. Might wantto get checked for STD.
XkPgw7ZRaa	Dear Emily,<br>  <br>  I feel there is nothing wrong with you.  You like your private life.  Sharing your strong feelings for your bf tells me you have passion to share.<br>  <br>  Maybe you read a lot and enjoy being with yourself.  <br>  <br>  Take Care!<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|b4199464cc3098e9c0df20d7671bd92baa	No. You're probably just conservative that way and feel content with one special person in your life. Imagine if we were all the same? I'm pretty much similar to you though, and I'm 20. <br>  <br>  If you feel like you need to socialize more, there is also nothing wrong with that.

You can get so much out of being alone and it can be very fulfilling. The next time one of your girlfriends ask you to go out, you should definately go!

If you ignore your friends too much, they might stop inviting you places. Personally, I think that when you're in a relationship, it's good to have other friends, too, so you don't become too dependent on the person you're seeing.<br>  <br>  But that's just food for thought. Nothing wrong with liking your own company, if you're happy that way.|`|a984cQjKaa	if you're happy with the way things are, who's to say there's something wrong with you?|`|KqWivPpAaa	well, you might need to learn to type a little better, but besides that i don't see anything wrong. maybe you need to lighten up on yourself. enjoy the time you spend with your old man and take it easy... thanks the eagles lololol|`|qNDh5U0Haa	Based on the information given, no.

iPNOVR6Gaa	As a man, I can tell you that the penis can be a pretty tricky organ sometimes.  My guess is that all three things you've mentioned affected his erection: the emotions that being with you again brought on, the reduction in sensitivity due to the condom, and the effects of alcohol.  Try not to let it bother you at all - it happens to just about every man at some point in his life.  (And those who disagree with that last sentence probably just haven't reached that point yet.)|`|xQnkYyocaa	It was probably a combination of the alcohol and the condom. It's not your fault, as I have some of the same issues with my bf. If it doesn't work once, you just have to keep trying. It will eventually happen. Take condom off next time and suck it. It should get hard!  Good Luck!!|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	If you're intimate enough to have intercourse with him you should be able to ask him this question yourself.  Perhaps he's connected with another woman and feels guilty for sleeping with you?|`|AA11101968	The alcohol can ave something to do with it, but also the condom itself can restrict blood flow.  That being said, don't stop using a condom fo that reason!|`|8747ad5946dec06c50e2f01268404c87aa	Could be the booze/beer.<br>  Maybe you smell different to him. Many of us get excited over smells as well as sights.|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	The problem is the condoms. They are like making love with a glove on.|`|1MGXHYq9aa	Drunk sounds right|`|DEGClROKaa	pun intended haha..<br>  ok on the serious note... alcohol makes a lot of guys limp so it should be that. Although it could be a combination of reasons... one he may have contracted an std hence wearing a condom and he couldn't get it out of his mind which messed w/ his erection... or as you said its been a longggg time and maybe he wasn't feeling confident enough to live up to his previous performance ( you did say it was the BEST sex ever) ummm idk.. don't feel put off by the last incident... go ahead and initiate it.. just lay off the alcohol next time|`|H24DtUKOaa	Alcohol inhibits sexual capacity.<br>  Apart from that, you can't imagine how hard (pun intended) it is for a guy to sustain an erection throughout sex for a relatively long time with a condom. It makes very little difference for a girl, but (sorry for being graphic) imagine if your clitoris was covered by latex. It wouldn't be too fun!<br>  Maybe take the COC pill? My girlfriend does and the sex is amazing<br>  Good Luck<br>  Max|`|o6ntWzM1aa	he may have been drunk or high on crack. or maybe just nervous. if you do him again he is going to try and get you pregnant so that he can control you. this is good advice so do not boink him!!!|`|uKr6TFxNaa	either too much alcohol or he was with someone else all day and was used up|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	it probably had more to do with him being drunk then anything.  but that will happen from time to time with men.|`|zhk8o514aa	Alcohol tends to do that.  Be sober next time you have sex.|`|y4SUDnpaaa	Sounds like the perfect situation to keep a guy from performing at his usual capacity. First time to use a condom with you, the getting comfortable with each other again after a long separation and the biggest erection killer.....being drunk. Give it a few days and I bet everything will be back to normal. To not make him not feel like a failure tell him it is  understandable list  all the list all the stress factors and especially being drunk as  more than enough to make that happen to anyone|`|AdeD0xMuaa	It's probably because he was drunk.|`|OHfZFR31aa	You posted this already. He was drunk and possibly tired and/or stressed|`|AA11447210	Could be either of those reasons, or something else (medications, medical condition, too much alcohol, drug use, lack of real interest, etc). <br>  <br>  If you aren't on a good form of birth control, you are playing russian roulette with your body in not requiring your lovers to wear a condom...not to mention risk of acquiring an STD.<br>  <br>  Most guys can get plenty aroused even with a condom on...the arousal occurs in the brain as much as stimulation to their 'organ'.<br>  <br>  Why is a fling with a former lover in Marriage & Divorce?

mvKDbb2uaa	I didn't get married there, but I did see a wedding take place there.  From what I saw, there were chairs set up but it was a small ceremony and quite short.  As for the reception, I would suggest finding a catering venue.  Right in the park is The Central Park Boathouse, which is beautiful (I wish we had looked at that before booking the place we got married at) and Tavern on the Green so those are two options that are right within the park and your guests can walk to.

He loved his dad and wanted to have a relationship with him but how can you have a relationship with someone that doesn't want to have it? Its hard working with someone to have something good when they don't care about it they just care about what they want to do with their lives. Your best bet is to do what you want with your life. Hang out with friends, manage a hobby, and listen to music. Keep yourself focused on what you want to do with your life and the day you get to do what you want without having to worry about if someone is putting you down. Or try to find a job. That will help manage some of your time. Helping you avoid having to be around the negativity.
f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	this is always a tough situation.<br>  <br>  if you want to stay connected with her so that you can keep tabs on her to make sure she's alright and to let her know that she has a safe place to go then you may need to suck up some of your loathing for her fiance to keep close.<br>  <br>  instead of putting her in defense mode and setting her up in a position where she feels she has to defend him from you.  Try asking open ended questions about her relationship that require her put a bit of thought in her answers.  When she complains about something he does or his father does  then you respond with something along the line of "how do you see that he is different from his father."  "how do you see any of this changing in before you marry him."  "How do you see the rest of your life unfolding with him?"  <br>  <br>  contact your local women's shelter for tips on how to handle her so she doesn't cut you off and read up on domestic abuse.  <br>  <br>  I also recommend the Gift of Fear by Gavin de Becker.  She might not be ready to read it, but you should and keep it handy so you can give it to her when she's ready.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	I would do what you can to make sure you friend is safe...but, them more you help her, the bf will hate you more because you are taking her away from him.

She had issues in her life from day 1. her mother left her to be raised by her grandparents so she could move off to another town w/a boyfriend (who was also an abusive reject of a man), and she was raised very liberally. They were her grandparents not her parents and so she had no structure. She craved attention from boys negative or positive. she never knew her father till she was 13 yrs old, and then the next year he passed away unexpectedly which just opened a whole other can of worms. <br>  she sought out acceptance from guys that were JUST HORRIBLE! i hated watching it, but i stuck by her through all the BS. All through high school i watched her decline. She started dating this loser that i had hoped was a phase, but he was just as messed up as she was if not more so. <br>  he was controlling, verbally and emotionally abusive, lazy, callous etc. I tried so very hard to get along w/him but he didn't like me. there was nothing i could have done, he wasnt going to like ANYONE in my ex best friend's life that could possibly shed some light on the fact that she would be better off w/out him!<br>  <br>  They lived together for a few years, he promised her a wedding, a life together and children but he never paid for anything. sure he worked...off and on, but she was the one that paid for the bills, the apartment they shared, food, and went to school full time. his money he kept for beer or expensive clothes or going out w/his rowdy group of friends.<br>  <br>  I got so tired of playing the nice person in all this mess. nothing i said ever sunk in for her. she felt i was being unfair to him, judging him etc. i couldn't win. i eventually realized that this was something that she was going to have to experience and learn from on her own, there was not much i could do about it, short from killing the weasel w/my bare hands, which i was tempted OMG!<br>  <br>  I had to go on w/my own life and stop letting this thing consume me. it hurt but it had to be done. we still talked, we would hang out from time to time and of course she would vent to me about her problems as she always did, and expect me to have all the answers for her. i was her miss. fix-it in a way. <br>  They eventually did break up after about 5 yrs together and she met and married an okay guy and they had a child. they still had some issues, but most couples do. he wasn't my first choice for her, but she loved him and he wasn't abusive in any way....just a bit of a momma's boy- meaning 2 nights a week he would stay the night w/his mother instead of being w/his family!...but that was something she was dealing with.<br>  <br>  our break up came after all the mess w/the terrible boyfriend. she changed, she became judgemental and uptight and as hard as i tried to ignore it i just couldn't handle the constant hostility from her anymore. people change and sometimes they grow apart. i decided that i had had enough of her dramatics and that since i had my own family now i didn't have time to deal w/her constant tantrums and problems she wanted ME to fix for her. she moved, and shortly thereafter we moved and our phone number changed, but i didn't keep in contact. <br>  <br>  Every once in a while someone from back home will tell me how she always brings me up when they run into her, being very nasty about the situation saying i abandoned her, that i chose my husband and children over her...which is ridiculous, i just needed space from her drama. <br>  <br>  Sometimes you can't fix everything for your friends, sometimes they need to go through their own stuff to find the light at the end of the tunnel. sometimes they do, sometimes they wallow in self pity.<br>  now of course if your friend's boyfriend is being abusive i'd be calling the police, or a local battered woman's center for advice, but if he's just a typical jerk w/issues she might need to go through this to learn something. we've all had our fair share of jerks.|`|R7b150Iyaa	Whew!  I made it through the novel...lol.<br>  This is a tough situation to be in because you're damned if you do and damned if you don't.  If you say nothing, let her marry him and pretend to be happy for her and then god forbid something happens (to her or their future children), you will never forgive yourself.  At the same time, there is only so much you can do as a friend and so much you can say without alienating her and losing her from your life altogether.<br>  <br>  If she complains about him, say gentle, non-threatening things like " I want you to be happy and I haven't seen you happy in a long time" or when she complains about how he texts and calls her all the time, you can say "that's not healthy" or something like that.<br>  <br>  I am in a similar situation with a friend.  She has been with the guy for almost 8 years, since the summer after high school.  She lost her virginity to him and the second time they had sex, she got pregnant and decided to keep the baby.  As soon as the baby was born, the guy started doing coke and drinking heavily, stealing from his son's college fund to support his drug habit.  My friend and him would break up every week and always get back together.  He proposed to her two years ago after coming out of rehab, and although he supposedly doesn't drink or do drugs anymore, he is still a bad and controlling person.  He does the same things you describe, call her constantly and accuse her of not anwering her phone.  He also got jealous after she hung out with me and my FIANCE as if she was going to cheat on him with her best friend's husband to be.  So unfortunately, your story rings way too true for me.  The good thing is, they haven't started planning a wedding yet.  The bad thing, the guy is not there for her even though they are broke and her father is dying of lung cancer.  At the same time, he can't even hold down a job.<br>  <br>  The difference with my friend is that she always complains about him and I have always made non-harsh comments to her about how she deserves better and that she shouldn't be treated this way.  So basically she knows everyone around her hates him, but she is still choosing to be in this situation.  It is very unfortunate, both for my friend and for your friend, because that's how dangerous situations like domestic abuse develop.<br>  <br>  Whew!  Mine's a novel too.  I also agree with Invisigoth about the types of questions you should ask her.  I'm pretty sure she already knows you can't stand the guy, but because you are her maid of honor, you can express yourself and say "it's hard to be happy for you when I see you miserable all of the time." or something to that effect.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped.  Good luck! =)|`|afI03mJXaa	I have never been in this situation with a friend before, but I will tell you this, being that you are her friend probably her best friend you are going to have to risk your friendship to get your point across. Sit her down and tell her, look you are my best friend and i love you and care about you very much. Now what i'm about to say is something you may not want to hear or like, but i think that you try and get help before marrying this guy. Let her know your reasons.This guy has serious trust issues and even though his father was very abusive doesn't mean that he is abusive. If he saw the abuse and everything else this could be why he is so insecure and not trusting her. I would suggest that you let her know that you are not saying that she shouldn't abandon this guy completely, but maybe they should consider getting counseling together. He needs to let go of the past because it is affecting the potential future of your friend and himself. He needs to understand that him isolating her is only going to push her away and everyone else. He has issues and this is something that you need to understand and try and help point them in the right direction. He can change and things can get better, but they both have to want to work at it. And if they cant work at fixing their relationship then they will definitely not be able to work at their marriage. Good Luck and God Bless|`|bI7wMCJXaa	If you can't support your friend in her wedding be honest with her and tell her that you don't feel comfortable being the maid of honor in her wedding and tell her why.<br>  <br>  I have never had a friend in the situation your friend is in. I was in the situation. And what happens is she will justify what he does, what he says. She might think something is wrong but will make excuses to herself about why what's going on is okay or blame HERSELF for what's going on. If he hits her she will blame herself for making him angry.<br>  <br>  Abusers come in many forms and he's one of them. Express your concerns to your friend just pointing out the things she's said to you that disturb you. This will have more impact on her than hinting ever will. Because to her if you see the same things she sees she can't make the excuses and justifications anymore. Encourage her to see her own counselor and to also go to couples counseling.<br>  <br>  He's an abuser and has all the signs. Your friend is in danger. His goal is to isolate her from her friends and family so he is all she has. Sounds like it's working so far. Don't force yourself to be her maid of honor if you can't support her marriage but let her know that you love her and no matter what you'll be there - and mean it.<br>  <br>  From personal experience when in an abusive relationship and you wake up one day and all your friends are gone and you have no one but your abuser you stand there and wonder - be alone or be with him? I didn't have a single person that I thought I could reach out to so I didn't and I tried to handle everything myself. I think I may be one of the fortunate few that managed to escape intact.

SHE NEEDS TO GET OUT OF THIS JEALOUS, ABUSIVE RELATIONSHIP BEFORE ITS TOO LATE!!!!!!!!!!!! { i hope i made my point}.|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Wow... First, I'd suggest contacting a local women's welfare center and get some trained help with this, because it sounds serious.<br>  <br>  All you can really do at this point is talk to her, which you say you've tried.<br>  Always try to re-inforce that you do this all with the utmost respect and love for her. But you'll probably have to tell her you can't be her maid of honor, because you can't support an obviously unloving and possibly dangerous relationship.<br>  <br>  Try to re-enforce what a loving relationship should be like. (No baseless threats and accusations, no control issues. She should never have to ask permission or justify her obvious actions...)<br>  Also firmly tell her, she cannot fix this man, she shouldn't be with him to improve him, because it will never happen. People can only change themselves, and it seems like he's not doing that since he blames all his problems on his upbringing.<br>  <br>  Fully expect her to get angry again.<br>  <br>  I was in a similar relationship, and though I knew everything that was wrong with the situation, I still didn't want to hear it.<br>  Just keep letting her know how much you love and worry about her.<br>  And like I said first, try getting proffessional help. Call a hotline or something. They will probably have better advice for you.|`|tyl9aSu9aa	I've been in a similar situation before (to your's, not your friend's). In her case though, my friend was being beaten and choked and still didn't get it, and I made the huge mistake of beating her over the head with the fact that I didn't like her boyfriend. Granted, whenever she needed to get away, she'd come to my house, where she felt safe, but as soon as he apologized, she went straight back home to him.<br>  <br>  One day, she disappeared, and no one has seen her since. I truly believe this guy killed her, and the police have never taken me seriously about it. That was four years ago.<br>  <br>  The worst thing you can do is keep telling her how much you hate him. I'd say it's probably okay to drop a little, "Why do you let him do _______" when he does something awful, but if you keep telling her how terrible he is (and from what you said, he certainly is), you're only going to push them into a neat little unit.<br>  <br>  She's not going to see him for what he is until she's ready - and she may never be. What's really telling is that she won't trust him to have a gun in their house - it sounds to me like the gloss on his ability to make her think he's a nice guy is cracking, even just a little bit. <br>  <br>  It's important that you slip in a lot about the fact that he doesn't take responsibility for his actions or feelings. Ask her why she thinks he does that, and if she thinks he does that about her. If he has this kind of resentment for his own family (who does sound kinda screwed up), chances are good he's building the same kind of hostility towards her, and that's dangerous.<br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is be supportive of her without being supportive of her relationship. It's a fine line to walk, but a lot of women stay in relationships like these long after they shouldn't because they think they can't do any better, or that they deserve this kind of treatment. <br>  <br>  So remind her she's great, be there for her, and ask her leading questions to get her to think carefully about this guy and the way he treats her - it may just be that that'll be the last push she needs to see him for what he really is.<br>  <br>  No matter what, though, make sure she keeps her foot down about the gun thing. If he brings it into the house, tell her she's got a safe place with you, and then be ready for her.|`|r5wLhpgqaa	I think you should voice your opinion to your friend. Yes, she might be pissed, even stop speaking to you, but it is obvious to me that she might be having second doubts. And that this man is not the one for her. She is going to have to be the one to decide whether to leave him or not. He sounds like he has serious issues and he doesn't need to marry anyone until those issues are dealt with.|`|hkwBR1moaa	She is asking you to stand up for her and support her and the marriage.  If you cannot honestly support this marriage, you should step down as maid of honor.|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	He is clearly a classic abuser and will either hurt her or worse in time, she needs to stop this relationship and no way marry this monster because once she does, it will quickly escalate as he will feel "ownership" of her and will seek to alienated her from family and friends so he has his victim all to himself. She will attack you if you say anything because she is afraid of him and feels trapped and she knows you are right but she feels helpless to do anything out of her fear. You can write down all you've said here, make it a personal letter, and give it to her and ask her to please read it, and that you wrote it out of concern for her. You can also add that the info is from what she has told you about him, it isn't as if you're creating all this on your own, you're going by what she told you.<br>  But you're right, she is already afraid of him and particularly concerned re the rifle...and following in his father's footsteps, very bad and dangerous combo.
xKgZAp1Oaa	Honestly getting over people just takes time. You have to find something else to think about, avoid him too, because seeing him and talking to him will just make you think about him more. and who knows sometimes when you stop paying attention to them..they start paying attention to you.|`|jEU9wcr1aa	Just occupy your time with something else. i have been in the same situation and its not easy.

AA11785140	Hmm.....you could probrably pay more attention to your appearance, what you wear. You don't necessarily have to behave obnoxious and slutty to be noticed. Sometimes....the mysterious....quiet thing could work to. My friend sounds like your friend, bigger, louder, dresses erotic...etc... and loves the attention she gets while im always way much more conservative. I still get a lot of attention anyway because...ppl find me intriguing. They say we are such a contrast how come we are even friends... I take care of myself, im smart....and stick to my own style. I indulge in conversations when ppl hit on my friend and say witty things that catches their attention. Trust me, after the novelty of the appearnce wears off...ppl actually like to have interesting conversations. This can be your winning point!|`|hPj1UJ8Raa	You are jealous about the attention, aren't you? Just be yourself. You don't have to react like that. If she gets attention because of her loud voice or her being slutty, you should be thankful because people don't see you like that. Again, just be yourself. Every individual is unique. XD|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	hey, I been having this problem too in school... I had try my very best but nothing turn out...

How long have you been with this boyfriend? To be honest, I think this boy is bad news. Talk to him properly, ask him why he is doing this. If he hasn't changed, then this shows that if anything else bad happens in the future with him, that he just isn't willing to change. <br>  <br>  Tell your Mum exactly what you have told us. She is your Mum and will understand, perhaps she will give you advice too if you want it from her.|`|5a2555ac452eb9763d0bd3b6614cf0eaaa	you need to talk to ur boyfriend because maybe he knows something that you dont. and your mom doesnt need to be really concrened because you are not doin it if it true what is being said about the friend.

c7d7ca36abf02ecfa04a421e9a75aaa1aa	Age doesn't matter, but it ties into maturity (which, therefore, is often reflected in the girl's age).<br>  <br>  Self-Awareness is huge.  A girl needs to be confident, but not over confident or cocky.  She needs to know what her strengths are and what her weaknesses are.<br>  <br>  She also has to know what she wants- out of life and out of her man.  Guys suck at reading a woman's mind to figure out what the f.$# she wants all the time.<br>  <br>  After that, much of it comes down to personal taste.  Some fatter, some thinner, blah blah blah.  Guys, these days, are a lot more flexible than we used to be.  But, just about every one of them would require the things I mentioned above as a minimum.  (I'm 45).|`|0ox8VKwKaa	I like girls that have a good positive self image and self esteem. Next would be their personality. I like a sense of humor and mostly a positive approach to life. They say chemistry is what attracts us to one another, but friendship is the glue that keeps us together. So common interests would be important too.I think women have easier access to their emotions and therefore are available for deeper levels of intimacy, which I enjoy.Age is usually about someone in my generation. There are plenty more but these for me are the important ones.|`|briRpzL1aa	Im 34, so I do not know if that qualifies as old... I typically date women who are 24 to 28...<br>  <br>  - Someone will a big smile and truly loves life<br>  - Someone who is willing to chase, and not just be chased.<br>  - Someone who knows who she is, what she wants, and goes after it.<br>  - Someone who is not obsessed with money.<br>  - Someone who wants a family one day.|`|K4ulbvUpaa	I figured id answer this since im 25 and my fiance is 38, older men look for a younger looking girl w/ a mature mind and sense of thinking.

exEuXXkiaa	well many people believe that true love does exsist and personally i do..... my definition for true love is sharing equal love between two people that you can be your self around and be envolved with and share good times... thats true love :] live strong love often|`|AA10671142	yes true love does exist. when you find the right person, you will know it. you want to be with that person all the time. you can talk to him or her about anything and not have to worry that person will make you feel bad. when you have a problem, you can go to him or her. I guess someone never found true love because they are giving thumbs down to everyone|`|vJIZkbRdaa	Yes i think that it can be felt|`|Wpulf29Maa	True love really does exist....I've found my true love. True love is a strong, warm feeling inside of you that you feel towards someone special in your life. It can't ever be taken away by anyone. You would do anything in the world for that special someone. You would want to be together 24/7 and never want to leave. True love makes you even want to die with or even for that person. You would give up everything in the world for the person.|`|91b8bd7dcb7f20d9dbddb636a06c5227aa	When a person is in love with another they want to spend all their time with that person.  They may think about how it would be to be married to that person and many  other thoughts.   They want to please the other person and do for them.  I think if you are in love with someone and married that love grows beyond putting in words, if you have chosen the right person.  You can love many for many different reasons and there is no comparison to being in love.|`|A0IvDqsGaa	i used to think it existed, but i am not too sure anymore. But you are in love, you know it. There is no questioning it. If you question it, then you aren't. Basically the thought of this person consumes you all day long, and just hearing his name makes your heart race. You know what his voice sounds like even when he is not around. You feel comfortable and natural around him, like he is your best friend. Really there is no good way to explain, it differs from person to person, but you just know when you are. You can feel it. Like i said before, if you question it, then you are not.|`|GY97evsBaa	Really really liking someone isn't the same as love...<br>  <br>  it depends...<br>  <br>  i really duno<br>  <br>  helpful, i know<br>  <br>  (:|`|djUMvICoaa	You think you really, really like a guy, that's infatuation.  Love comes after that to the lucky ones.  That only comes after you find how compatable you are what interests you share, if you feel comfortable in the relationship, how you are treated.  Something has to be nurtured before it can be loved.  You both have to take care of the relationship before you're really in love.  Otherwise you are settling for the infatuation you have and that's the best feeling you will get from that relationship, for infatuation can be shattered.  Some say true love exists, and I guess when both parties are working at it that would be my best defintion of true love.|`|AA11394554	you only know what true love is after you have lost it when you lose it the first time then you know what it is its hard to explain but very true.<br>  someone said it is better to have love and lost than never to have loved at all my reply to that is( try it ) love hurts and that is a fact if you feel that you are in love then go with it one day you will just know whether you were or not at the moment if you think you are then be happy with that.|`|LjxQv5TBaa	you just know. i seem to find out i really love someone after everything ends. when everything in your relationship is good and happy and you never think about losing them is a good sign you may love them. but if and when you do lose them you will really realize how much you loved them. but "really liking someone" and "love" are completely different things. and you will eventually realize that|`|2sBzrxxfaa	To me, True Love is a Feeling that makes your Heart beat rapidly. Where you can not stop stareing at that person, a smile forms and then you kinda blush.<br>  <br>  Weird for a guy to Blush, but yes it happens!<br>  <br>  Girls seem to "feel" True love more than Guys, we just notice the affects of it.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	true love is more than a feeling, its sacrificing being selfish and doing everything you can to put the other persons wants and needs ahead of yours|`|b8QM7NY6aa	We never really know we just think we do, if you're old enough go on have fun and enjoy it while it lasts, oh and by old enough i mean 21 and above.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	What's up,  Nice question, , I think you have to figure this one out yourself. Do what works for you.|`|tXrtRFoNaa	love is when you want your partner to be and do every thing they want too|`|fQo6ZVm7aa	That is a very( iffy) question. Yes True love does exist but it is so hard to find, someone is always after something money,sex,bring you down, and etc. Love is not as real and strong as it use to be and everyone was there fro each other for the right reason. My parents have been married over 20 years now that's is true love but im sure they went threw a lot to get where they are at now. Today everyone so quick to give up and now you have females trying to be male players and males being the same old dogs! So its on your situation you have to be very careful and look at the lil things the lil things allays lead up to the big things. Beware of sign's and things of that nature. Someone can give you a definition for love but love is indescribable when you come across it you will know!|`|rjC7b0Sqaa	True love to me is feeling appreciated, my thoughts and feelings respected, giving space to one another and just respecting that space.  Not being jealous, overbearing, or controlling.<br>  <br>  Listening to each other, cuddling, lots of kissing and .........!<br>  <br>  Expect problems but that yelling at each other or ignoring each other are never effective communicating tools.  <br>  <br>  Just love each other and touch each other often,(hold hands, arms around each other, just be loving).  This is my definition it took me 20yrs to find my true love but I finally have and this is what works!|`|k0hhiATsaa	love can b alota things...and alot of different ways<br>  <br>  true love...like i used to think<br>  no<br>  true love like we all want<br>  no<br>  <br>  but true love like 2 people that care about eachother...mabye even alot<br>  <br>  sure<br>  <br>  p.s. in-love is easy..."true love" in my opinion takes all different kinds of love together(including in-love) that sustains through change of itself...ups and downs in different aspects, felt by both(or all) the people(or puppies)|`|6a20a722662e646b9861b6c3014628a6aa	The first time I fell in love I felt like I wanted to spend ALL my time with him, and when we werent together, all I could think about was him.

GhsqaXsdaa	I had a similar problem, my ex threat end to kill himself if i wasn't with him. It was really scary. If you love her, do what you feel would help her. What i did was told my school that he was going to commit suicide, (because if i told his parents they wouldn't care, there dumb a**'s.) And now hes fine, hes still my friend and he thanked me for telling his guidance consular. <br>  <br>  Now i don't really think it's the same thing with you, you love her rite? She must love you if she threat end to kill herself rite? Talk to her, face to face, and ask her whats up. Ask her why said said that online, and tell her how you feel. I know it sounds dramatic but sometimes that's how you have to be. <br>  <br>  Hope everything works out :)|`|zNFqe8Iiaa	Dont if she doesnt treat you the way a girlfriend is supposed to treat her bf then forget about her...

Probably best not to be involved right now if she is this troubled.<br>  <br>  My best guess is that you are young, possibly contact her parents or a sibling or a councelor at school and share her suicide threat and let them help her.<br>  <br>  That way her family can help her and you have done a very responsible thing and did not ignore a suicide threat aka a cry for help.<br>  <br>  If you love each other, that love will still be there after she gets help.<br>  <br>  Cookie|`|4JrDGW7Taa	Yes, this relationship is absurd. This is not what communication is all about. Sentences must communicate. If you are not certain what the other party means - if she is playing games - you can simply ask "what do you mean?"

3jQsbszpaa	Well if you both already know that you like each other than why not go for it he sounds like a great guy and you sound like a nice girl I think you to would do well. I would just tell him that I still had a thing for him and see what he says and if he still has a thing for you then your good to go. Good Luck! :-).|`|KPXwwwMMaa	Any advice we can give you on what to write him/say to him isn't going to be as effective as anything you make up. He likes you... and he chats with you all the time to hear what YOU have to say. You can't really say anything wrong, unless he isn't really that into you. Just be cute, and girly and flirty, and you'll be fine.<br>  <br>  If you're interested in something long-term, you might test the waters by asking him where this relationship is going. It's a very valid relationship question. Ask yourself that question, too. It sounds like you like each other, but since you live 1.5 hours away, what exactly would you expecti in a relationship? <br>  <br>  But be careful: If you guys decide you're 'dating' from 1.5 hours apart, you'll likely get really revved up to see each other, and have fireworks whenever you do get together... then in the downtime, he'll find somebody to keep him busy when you're not there, and eventually dump you. It doesn't always happen that way, but i've seen it happen most of the time.

OSK0tQPSaa	You cannot change her mind. I had a friend like that and he refused to listen to anything i had to say about it.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Back when I was in school, my friend wanted to try Qualudes.  I couldn't talk her out of it.  We were safe but I just didn't want to do it. So we each had a pill in our hands, and said ready, one two three and we swallowed them.   <br>  <br>  Mine was still in my hand, I never did it.  I was by her side the entire night and made sure she was ok.  She had no idea that I wasn't drugged.  It didn't matter.  She had a great time, passed out.  She was safe.  <br>  <br>  You will never change anyone's mind who is set on doing it.  They will try to make you look stupid.  Give up.  Pretend like you are taking it.<br>  It is a trip to watch them trip.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Don't be a sheep and follow the crowd. There are lots of dangers of taking drugs and they lead to taking harder drugs.|`|OKPFeBtYaa	Having a bad trip sucks.  The problem is, you don't know what's going to happen.  It depends on your personality, any subconscious issues that you've buried inside may come bubbling out.  You could spend the whole night huddled in a corner, crying and rocking back and forth.  I've seen that one before.  Especially teenagers.  You've got a lot of hormones and emotional issues at your age.  Acid will not make things clearer for you most of the time.  <br>  Also it lasts a long, long time. (10-12 hours, depending on how much)  Maybe you'll have flashbacks in the future. Of course some folks take it once and go nutso and never come back.  Maybe you'll have a fun trip, and a good time, but that is just one possibility out of many.  Many possibilities are not good.  Especially if the friend has some emotional problems or insecurities.  And don't do coke either! Not at your age.  Stick to cannabis, don't kill yourself with overpriced garbage.|`|znvx2NMQaa	well all i can say is if she is that ******* stupid to try something that is obviously dangerous even the coke bit then let her do it and suffer the concequences.<br>  <br>  no condolences for stupidity.|`|ztZI0MHcaa	15 AND DOING DRUGS?!!<br>  THAT IS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.<br>  i agree with Grace T, stop while you can, and those 'friends' are bad influences on you, they can make your drug using habit worse, ditch them and get new friends.|`|2BesFBv9aa	With acid you have no idea what you are really taking...as with coke!!! Acid can have horrendous side effects especially if people have an underling problem..depression, history of psychiatric problems in the family can come through to someone who is vulnerable and takes acid!! I nursed a 17yr old who took acid...he could no longer see out of one eye and his pupil had blown..He was extremely ill. As were several people who I've nursed in A&E who ended up on life support machines after taking both coke and acid!!<br>  Stay away from both of them.. I know you think you are getting a great buzz and high from them but what for? Why are you taking these at 15? I may sound old and boring to you but believe me, I'm neither. I just know they are a bad mix and just as bad on their own. Please don't take either!!<br>  I'm honestly here to help. Mail me if you need more help|`|q1qACJxLaa	that disgusting, a 15 year ld doing coke. get out while you can and egt new friends, your friend is obviously very bored with her life and cant have fun with out drugs. ditch em
FXCoGD44aa	Is a marriage proposal out of the question?<br>  <br>  If it is...<br>  You can take a day or weekend trip somewhere nice. Make some hotel reservations. Depending on what you like, you can go site-seeing, 6 Flags or whatever suites your taste.<br>  <br>  You can get her a spa day package at her favorite Salon and Spa, complete with a massage, facial, mani & pedi.<br>  <br>  My boyfriend and I recently took up dance lessons together. It's really fun and it keeps that "spark" in our relationship because it feels like a date every time we go.<br>  <br>  Is there a little puppy or other animal that she has been wanting so bad? If it's appropriate you can always surprise her with one with a big bow around its neck.<br>  <br>  If all of the above is out of your price range, you can always make her breakfast in bed with some roses. <3|`|iP863XM6aa	Well, my boyfriend recently got me a white gold locket and on the back he had it engraved : I love you baby..<br>  <br>  You could do something like that and put a picture of you guys inside? I found it really sweet and i wear mine all the time :)|`|dd479dba6e1b55e5264b83b0e92db845aa	roses<br>  piece of jewelry<br>  the newest perfume  maybe <br>  "versace bright crystal" or<br>  "vera wang - flowers"<br>  day at the spa certificate<br>  box of "godiva chocolates" + champagne & strawberries|`|AA11982696	Do you guys live together?

It's nice that even after 3 years you wanna surprise her for no reason with something, that's awesome! Flowers are always nice, but its kinda the whole "been there done that" thing too. My husband (when we were just dating) went out to Michaels craft store and picked out an arrangement of their dried fake flowers and  put it together himself in a vase with stones, etc. and gave them to me for no reason and said how he put them togther and liked them so much b/c I would have them forver and they will never die. (I still have them of course, and they look AWESOME) My husband is artistic so I had had him draw a pic of the 2 of us, make me things, etc. and it always seemed so genuine and sincere b/c he took the time to make it and not just simply buy something.  Good luck, and just make sure it's from the heart.|`|bCgW89MLaa	Flowers to her work!  Yes she might be a little embarassed, but it's a great feeling to know that everyone knows how sweet you are and hope much you love her.  <br>  <br>  Otherwise make something.  Something that takes time and effort and thoughtfulness will mean mounds more than anything else|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Take her shopping for new clothes. I know you may not enjoy this for your sake but you may discover that she enjoys getting your thoughts on outfits she picks out.  <br>  <br>  Also, get her a certificate for a hair doo.<br>  <br>  I know these these things work<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|Jb2PZpMVaa	Aww that is soo sweet.<br>  <br>  im 23 and if that happened to me i would have loved to have got, maybe some flowers, with a little card on them telling me how much my bf loves mee.. i would love him soo much for that ! <br>  <br>  Hope this helped ! <br>  <br>  Good luck ! <br>  <br>  xxxx|`|p26GhFcCaa	i say take her out somewhere nice where you can have really nice day together!<br>  <br>  Flowers are sweet but they just die, and is rather effortless.|`|CnHYgd7baa	awwwwwww. that is soooooo sweet. even if you don't get her anything just telling her how much you love her would maake her more than happy. good luck
wWzK6eJaaa	I would tell him how much I wanna torture his marshmellow fatness. I would pick him up by my favorite tweezers and drop him into an ant farm and watch them crawl all over his grossness, like he let the chic do to him...Then after the ant mess is over i would put him in the sink, filled with cold water and slowly add hot water until he burns and falls apart like he did to my heart...ps i was with him for 6yrs..LOL|`|2WfHLUyOaa	hahahahaha lol id take off his pance and ask him how his tommy winky got so big all of a sudden...hahaha good question|`|fouEsSofaa	I'd hold the jar over the hot stove and watch him dance the "Hot Foot" and "Toasted Buns".|`|AA12107238	I wouldn't bother to even capture him in the jar.

By the way, in case you cant tell I dont like him very much.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I'd get one of my neices Barbies, my son's monster truck and put them in the jar.  I'd say Barbie this is X, X this is barbie   Have fun|`|8arOL9Jdaa	I am really good friends with all of my exes so I would help him get back to normal size and then maybe go grab lunch with him|`|W0qFAIVuaa	Male here.But she would go in the jar with a urine sample and offf to the lab.Tell me about your thoughts on your x.|`|rrWhhiMEaa	Keep him in there and ignore him.

Once she breaks a toe kicking you, she'll get over it fast!|`|znvx2NMQaa	obviously she doesent want u to breed.|`|d0WK1j47aa	lol, yeah i definitely went through that phase. still in it:)|`|XqaAm12Yaa	I don't know if it's curiosity or not but I know a remedy for that. She obviously does that because she thinks you can't get her back the same way. But you should know that you can. Moreover, unlike her, you have as many as three options to choose from: <br>  <br>  1. You can kick her in the crotch. Of course it's not gonna hurt her as much as you, UNLESS you hit her clit. Yes, if you hit the clit she'll drop like a sack of potatoes and will be in pain for quite a while.<br>  <br>  2. You can punch or kick her in the lower belly. This way you will hit her ovaries and she'll enjoy the same sensation that guys enjoy after a ball shot.<br>  <br>  and finally something that she can't do to you:<br>  <br>  3. Punch her in the boobs or, since she grabs your nuts, give her a nice tit squeeze. Her pain and reaction will be the same as yours after a nut punch.<br>  <br>  Well, as you can see, with women you have many more options to choose from, so make your choice and teach her the hard way. And trust me, one lesson (=one blow) will be enough to solve this problem (-'|`|Rczat6jHaa	That's weird!! I've never heard of anything like this before. A lot of girls at my school do it to the guys. But they just kick not GRAB!!!! That's gross!! You're her brother!! Maybe it is curiosity. Tell her to stop because that is completely inappropriate.|`|C9105PwHaa	To her its probably pleasurable  and yes its a phase|`|NiRFYhVDaa	maybe she enjoy your reactions when she do that anyway since she is younger try explaining to her|`|tzy4kOEraa	maybe she whats to know how it feels and shes afraid to do it to some else|`|fOK3tPRVaa	ok i kick my bro in the nuts but grabbing that's disgusting
pn2t0gejaa	It's nice that other people see life like that .I moved1600 miles to be close to two of my boys and have to fight to see them .I move my wife and our four kids and regret it very much .ex just wants $$$$$$ and to be able to say i am not here for them.and makes plains when it's my weekend for them to have fun so they don't want to come over!|`|iZDsMCghaa	Its great to see someone else feels this way. Divorced couples are a many these days so it isnt rare to bump into one and its so common for women to try to keep their kids away from their fathers.Cant these women see the divorce is between her and the ex not the ex and hr and the kids? Its horrible. This isnt to say there arent a huge  percentage of men who are true dead beat dads but some arent and these women are using the wrong weapon against these men because their kids are doing alot of the suffering for it.<br>  I do ant to say one thing though in regards to these "poor ex husbands". They have a voice, if there wasnt any abuse involved, they have every right and many men just sit there and accept it instead of fighting for their kids.|`|i1rDJY2aaa	My husband and I are currently dealing with the exact same thing with his ex-wife. We have been to court about two dozen times in the two years we have been together.|`|mCM363I9aa	it goes both ways, you will see the ex husband or ex wife making it difficult, but who are the one's who suffer? their children.|`|5EOLbVzQaa	yea see this is why i a glad i got a good man who is a great father who has no ex wives in his past.|`|TrEYixLXaa	The sad part is that the children are the one's who suffer.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	I see what you are saying, but it goes both ways...there are many crazy ex-husbands and ex-wives.|`|1pjyJq1iaa	be a support, but don't try to save the world, your arms are only so strong. This is the very reason why we are so in need of a Loving God. Jesus is our refuge and strength. Seek Him and lean not on your own understanding. <br>  <br>  This isn't about finding a church or religion, it is simple belief in God and admitting our wrongs in thinking we have all the answers for our lives.

AA12159712	The important thing here is if you allow him to move in, that lines are drawn about sharing responsibilities for sharing expenses, bills, furnishings, etc. And that agreements are made on allowing other visitors, etc.  Duties on cleaning and maintaining the apartment should be deliniated as well.  Agreements on keeping what each had that was brought in at the beginning should be stated.  These are all little things that always seem to come up in court later if things don't work out and have to be resolved only too late by a judge in civil court. So you need to start this off with "eyes wide open" to all possible things that could happen.|`|pR0pJNJkaa	I usually feel people should take time to learn who they are dealing with. At the same time, my fiancee and I moved in after 3 months and we are getting married next month. We are in absolute love. For us it was a great decision. Steve Harvey said in his new book "Think like a man, act like a lady" that women need to be like a job and keep the guy on probation for 90 days before giving him any benefits. 3 months equal 90 days.|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Omg yes! Definately too soon. Def wait a year to move in with him and til you know him more. You don't know someone until you live with him. At least wait til the honeymoon period is over (6 months).|`|AA10266072	2 months seems kinda quick.  I always found that you don't even really know somone until after the third month.  That's when they start getting comfortable and really start being themselves.|`|deZArjX7aa	It's definitely too soon.|`|tkUCHhAdaa	Not in this economy, just make sure he pays for half, otherwise your just a sugar mama.|`|RyYV3aXlaa	make sure you've got a place to fall back on if you move in with him . and then go for it have fun.|`|CceiP7q5aa	way too soon in my opinion|`|E92T9c63aa	Your instincts are right:  it's way too soon to be moving in together.  With only 2 months of dating, you don't even know the "real" him yet.  Why does he want to move in?  To save money?  For convenience?  If you really want to give this a chance of becoming a long-term relationship, then wait at LEAST 6 months before you even think of moving in.  Although, you should know that the divorce rate is higher for couples who live together before marriage.

884v4VhGaa	I'd actually tell him now, rather than wait until he gives them to you. Just let him know that you found some rather shocking swimsuits when you were putting away the ironing. <br>  <br>  You don't really need to say anything more - the idea is to start a conversation. He will likely, at this point, explain what they're for. He might also avoid the topic, possibly to keep them something of a surprise.<br>  <br>  Either way, when he says that he got them for you to wear,  just point out to him that it's not the sort of thing that you're really comfortable wearing. You can give him examples in terms of what you normally wear if he doesn't understand how revealing they are. <br>  <br>  If you're comfortable with it, suggest that if he wants you to wear something that revealing that you can do so in private, when it's just the two of you (i.e. some nice lingerie).|`|aSvOaAjiaa	They are not for you, they are what he wears in private, there is still a lot you need to know about your hubby to be!|`|sbeoF50gaa	I don't want to sound weird but maybe you should take a picture and see what people think of you in a bikini. I know what you mean though. I could never wear a bikini, I don't think I even owned a swim suite after the age of like 8? The picture idea, you could post on this site called hot or not people rate what you look like, and you could chop ur head off if you don't want people to know who you are. If you get a high score maybe this will give you the courage to wear it in public. OR you could buy some of those wrap arounds they look nice and cover you up at the same time. But if you're going to marry this guy, you shouldn't feel uncomfortable telling him anything. :) he should be your best friend.|`|AA11380378	You man likes to wear girl clothes LMAO!!!!|`|03n14OLLaa	I haven't wore a bikini since I was six because i'm so pale. I can barely stand to be in a bathing suit at all. Perhaps you could tell him that you will wear them but only for him and only when no one else is around. Good Luck!!|`|crxbob5jaa	If he gives them to you, then wear them when it's just the two of you. You don't have to wear them in public to make him happy.|`|wADnvKGFaa	He obviously loves your body and thinks your are so beautiful ( and I'm sure he's right!)  If you cant bring yourself to wear the on the beach, then why not just wear them in your hotel room?  Best of both.  Im sure he'll understand.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	It could just be a honest mistake on his part - he bought them thinking you'd like them.<br>  <br>  Just tell him you don't feel comfortable wearing them - if he's a decent guy, he'll accept your choice.|`|5acf40d2aa61e65eff15834add1f7bd5aa	Are you sure these are for you?????

The truth hurts.. and i'm sorry for that. You cannot dwell on the past, or else you will miss out on what's present. hurting yourself isn't going to accomplish anything, just pull the wrong kind of attention towards you. Separation anxiety is a big issue with more and more ppl everyday. You will never fully understand why she did what she did. It's not how hard you're pushed down, but how quickly you can get back up. <br>  <br>  In other words(just being blunt), grow up and stop being a child. This is the real world. ppl will do whatever they can do to make themselves happy... and step on whomever to get there. <br>  <br>  Sorry for your pain, but get out there and get your "game" going.|`|n5YJS2Z7aa	i think it's more than obvious that you do. but, you know, sometimes it's better to forgive and forget.|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Yeah you probably still have feelings for her, or you are just lonely and kinda obsessed with her. Sometimes a man can mix up those things. Anyway...have fun. Go out with the guys, find some girls, watch tv etc...Here is an article that might help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.isnare.com/?aid=194282&ca=Relationships" rel="nofollow">http://www.isnare.com/?aid=194282&ca=Rel...</a><br>  <br>  And don't ever do the same thing to a girl, at least not without a good explanation, because you know how it feels...<br>  <br>  P.S If she ever wants to get back with you again, give her a second chance, everyone deserves it, but only if she seems serious about it. And of course if she hurts you again, forget all about her.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :)|`|ErvhPYlbaa	Of course you still have feelings for her!  These things don't just go away the second we break up!<br>  <br>  I think it's sweet that you feel this way... it seems like most guys move on way too quickly.  This means that you are truly capable of giving another girl the WORLD!  All we really want is someone who loves us and wants to be with us.<br>  <br>  You are smart to not take her back.  She doesn't deserve you anyway.  I've been through sooo many breakups.  A few of them have literally turned my life upside down so I know the pain you are talking about.  <br>  <br>  Keep your focus.  Do things to improve yourself, and it's okay to admit you still have feelings (this is NORMAL and you are a HUMAN!), just don't act on them!!|`|EVZtirRuaa	Don't take all these seriously. Just think it happens with all and move on. And, even after that you feel like you can't get her out of your mind then you should talk to her about it. May be you think she has dumped you but in reality, she is the one who is hurt but is unable to tell for some unexplained reason?!?|`|bT713RWqaa	i have been broken up from my ex since april 2007. we haven't spoken since july of last year...<br>  recently bumped into this ex this past october....<br>  <br>  we had a miserable relationship...very unstable......but when it was good, it was really good.<br>  <br>  there is no time limit on when you should be over someone. especially if she meant a lot to you, and the relationship ended on bad terms.<br>  <br>  generally speaking...it is very normal to feel this way i guess....missing someone... but no worries..one day you will wake up and you will feel ok...|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I would say that you're still grieving the end of the relationship.  You may miss her or you may just miss being in a relationship.  I think getting over someone takes time.|`|0JGFv5PXaa	your just taking a longer process in moving all, its ok man

JJMa25NWaa	Uhm, it seems as though you're a girl typing this question. That's fine, but if you are a girl, you have to make sure she rolls that way and likes other girls. If not, you should really try and find someone else. If she does like other girls, then just start off with hello. Do you know what activities she's into? If you do, maybe you can get into the same ones and you guys will surely become friends. Anyway, to lose some weight, just eat five to six small healthy meals a day. Not three big ones. Jump some rope, its fun and you burn around 11 calories per minute. Jump rope is easy and a good cardio exercise. Hope I helped..|`|DhwcHdfVaa	aww, thats so sweet :) <br>  <br>  Maybe get a friend to intervene or something, or leave her a letter in her mailbox? <br>  <br>  I bet you dont need to lose weight but if you do, just make sure you eat 1,500 calories a day, don;t eat any carbs after 5pm and try walking for 30 minutes a day. <br>  <br>  Or you can go on a meal supplement for  afew weeks such as optifast, in which you can lose 10kg in 3 weeks. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|rV8aWISGaa	jsut bring up old memories. tell her how much fun you used to have with her and ask her if she would like to hang out some day soon. <br>  <br>  try eating healthier and jogging. do some exersising everyday for thirty minutes. goodluck!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Karen,<br>  <br>  Can you talk to her?  Is she in to girls?  Do you get that feeling from her?<br>  <br>  Go for it.  Let her know you are interested.  Can't hurt.<br>  <br>  If you want to talk more, get back to me.<br>  <br>  Anthony|`|n5YJS2Z7aa	it's actually quite simple. you first have to overcome your fear of talking to her. after that, just try to be her friend. ask for her number. eventually, she'll get the idea and she'll invite you to go places, you guys will talk a lot more. try giving her hugs. after you guys are good friends, ask her out. it almost never works if she doesn't even know you.|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Well if she likes men, you are probably not going to get very far. But just start complimenting her and try to find out what she likes to do for fun. That way you can go hang out together. If you want to lose weight, you need to measure your food. Eat like 5 times a day, small meals. (two of those being snacks) like protein shakes, vegetables, preferably organic foods. Cut out all soda, and sugars. Run, do something that will raise your heart rate. If you can hold a conversation while you are working out, you are not working hard enough. Hope that helped.|`|5IsWhzHCaa	Go for a run every morning.<br>  <br>  You say you used to be best friends, why can't you talk to her? <br>  Just say something like ''You look nice today, did you want to do something later?''<br>  <br>  P.S Where's my sugar and honey?
xMCuUvd4aa	You probably need some counseling.  I have heard of instances where rape and abuse at a young age has impacted the sexual proclivities of people.  I don't know if it is because you were exposed at such a young age to fairly taboo sex, or if there are suppressed guilt feelings.  <br>  <br>  You should speak to your OB/GYN and get her recommendation for a good professional counselor.|`|AA12159712	It's not unheard of to like older men. Especially when they are more experienced, can provide financial security, and usually know and understand how to treat women better than younger men do.  That's all the usual good reasons. Your reason sounds rather unhealthy and rather warped. I think you need to talk to a professional psychologist before you try doing what you think. Especially if your abuser from childhood was someone close enough to you to befriend you and then abuse you. This could set you up for a very unhealthy look at relationships.|`|53e949fcb6f622d9410af657fd269e0baa	ive been in similar situation. i was sexually abused as a child and im into older guys but not that old..and the thing with me is im kinda sex-addicted..like i have to have it very often and theres barely anytime that im not in the mood for it..|`|FzFSzilmaa	more like a father complex... you need comfort, security... happens a lot...<br>  <br>  if you are over 18, then don't worry... enjoy the relationships with us older men... we do with younger women... ;)|`|Oz5F8Alfaa	it is normal to have fantasy of having sex your way. In your case it is not normal, because you have an unsolve past in your desired which is not a healthy way to think about sex.  It is best to seek for counselling and straight your thought out that way you can get rid of your past and move on.|`|JIjuNh9Maa	im in the same situation as you. except when i was younger and sexually abused, i liked it. i didnt think it was wrong because i didnt know what was going on. and i like older guys now. i know the two are connected but i dont think there is anything wrong with that.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	thats a tough one. maybe at the time it did not feel like abuse and felt good.|`|HosJ3bNgaa	WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!...|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Hi there, I am going to send you an email ok. I hope its helpful.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Talk to a professional my dear. You have desires that are not healthy and need to be resolved. Don't continue that pattern of abuse at your own hands. I am sure there are support groups for people in your situation and they will be better able to help you. <br>  <br>  Good luck!
RyYV3aXlaa	now we're even we don't understand girls either. (some of us claim to..but we really don't) as far as what type of girls we like them all, pretty ones are at the top of the list.|`|dHDe64FUaa	I do not really like girls, who use slangs.<br>  I especially hate girls who are extremely quiet and shy. I had girlfriend who was like this, I realized I liked only her body, she was so boring, and annoying. <br>  I love women who is women, and who have confident to talk to males. That is woman I dream and going to get.|`|aR1OiJ7Waa	big ****|`|nYEwK5FNaa	The guys mind is underestimated when it comes to a woman. I have a girlfriend of 4 years. She means everything to me. She is beautiful both inside and out. The best smile, eyes, laugh, voice, body, personality. When she walks into the room even if you don't see her enter the room you know she is there. She gives you that connection that vibe. She shows you that she cares and lets all the guys know that she is taken. Not clingy or obsessive, but in love. You just gotta feel right. <br>  Great sex also helps to relieve the days stress =] but that's not all that its about. Think about who makes you feel special and make them feel special, it has to be mutual.|`|briRpzL1aa	-Someone who loves life and always sees the bright side of things.<br>  -Someone who has a life of her own, and goals/ambitions of her own.<br>  -Someone who does not need me, but enjoys being with me.<br>  -Someone who does not struggle about having a family or not one day.<br>  -Someone that even a simple smile makes me the happiest person alive.|`|5aXKo6uCaa	a great personality and style and a sense of humor|`|yrVti01Uaa	a nice personality, sense of humor, some looks, but not too much, and one that gives me some space from time to time.|`|waOy76t2aa	1. attractive girl... average or above average body!!! <br>  <br>  open to new things and fun to be with...<br>  <br>  a girl im compatible with.. we should get along well... who understands me and accept me with all my faults and issues...lol..<br>  <br>  NON FUSSY GIRL definitely!!!!<br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  ~wytch|`|zfWmQst5aa	Outgoing, and honest. looks don't matter that much as long as you're not 100 over your target weight and your face hasn't been hit with a bat 500 times.<br>  <br>  btw target weight: If you're 5'0 you should weigh around 100 give or take 10 pounds either way, after every inch add 5 pounds same rules apply<br>  <br>  bye bye|`|AAivZMMOaa	me my self, i dont like comitment.. if  the girl shows that she is ready for the biggg comitment, then...... i just left her..... its scary... lil tips for you, dont show too much interest to your boys.. the less interest you show, the boys will crazyly chasing after you.. trus me.. im a boy...|`|tkUCHhAdaa	The Cylon type, preferably Number 6, my wife is into her.|`|PY51kBTjaa	Girls that are into music, have good style and a amazing personality does it for me|`|kgIccwR0aa	if u talking abt da outside appeal just be sexy in clothing wise....interior no one iz perfect da one dat luvs our faults iz da 1 for us.|`|5es7ct2Baa	nice a like nice girl's|`|ATKiSyP8aa	Someone with some sense of spirituality<br>  Someone with motivation goals & optimism<br>  Someone who mutually would go the extra mile for you<br>  Who listens to things on a mans' mind.

VP7KAe12aa	Well you live somewhere else know I'm assuming because you left that school. <br>  So I think there wouldn't be no problem adding them on Facebook. I mean there are a lot of people who just add random people, and you never know Chris maybe when they look back on how bad they treated you that they may regret it and may want to become friends with you again.<br>  <br>  You aren't running away from your past infact you seem more cuirous on how they would look like and if there personality is different. I know I would atleast. Go ahead and add them if you feel unsure you can always block them or take them off of your Facebook friends part.<br>  Goodluck Chris!<br>  <br>  Summer
hHndD5SEaa	Because guys you know wont exactly go around broadcasting the fact that they're virgins etc etc...<br>  Here - people can be anonomous - no one need ever know who they are so they can say and do as they please.... its not like that in real life<br>  xx|`|gAuIixm6aa	Because they stay at home reading and stuff.

HosJ3bNgaa	say hi ask her how gym is going and write back to me cause i need to know if she gose to your school|`|JhvqUvlsaa	You can't force a friendship. If you left a Valentine in her locker then I would wait and see if she responds to that. If not don't worry; if this is meant to be, that you two become friends then it will happen. And as far as what to say to her; just act natural. Say, "hey, you're level 8 in gymnastics? Wow! How do you get to level 8? I'm only a four!" And ask about her favorite tv shows and movies and stuff.<br>  <br>  Just let the pieces fall where they may; if it's meant to be that the two of you become best friends, great; if not there's someone else for you out there. You really can't force a friendship; you got to let them just happen.
RzNdGmI9aa	They do it to make themselves look more interesting.  It's like how people put in their profiles that they like all sorts of activities, then when you meet them, you find out that they only tried it once.|`|LW3L08xIaa	oops. didn't think that was a problem. i think that where a person has been and who they talk to have a lot to do with the personality of a woman. so when putting up a profile, the topic of who and where comes up. sorry if it offends you mr. hotshot.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	I've seen quite a few men whose profiles fit that description as well.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry guys but a drunk shot of you and your pals groping the waitress at hooters is not enticing (fwiw:  the waitress didn't look too thrilled with them either.)|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	never believe everything you SEE!!|`|AA11447210	Ah, but you're looking at it all wrong.<br>  <br>  Pics of oneself should definitely be included, but photos of friends and travel show a LOT about who a person is and what they like. Say profile that allows 12 photos and they are all of the person gives you 12 different (maybe) looks. What does it tell you about them? That they can hold still for a photo and you get an idea about their wardrobe.<br>  <br>  Pics of friends shows you they have friends (a good things) and the kinds of things they do with their friends. If the pic is of them and their friends getting rowdy and drinking, and you aren't into people who drink...that could be important to you.<br>  <br>  Pics of trips shows they have traveled or like to travel. If you like that also, bonus. Maybe you'll see a location that you have also visited and can base a conversation off of that.<br>  <br>  Pics in profiles should be varied. What a person does in their life outside of work shows a lot about them. There may be a pic of them doing volunteer work...that tells something about them. A photo of their pet tells you they like animals or are at least close to their pet (that's something you should know). If their pic is of their adored cat, and you are allergic, there could be an issue.<br>  <br>  My online profiles have pics of me that clearly show what I look like, but also of cruises I've been on, adventures with friends, and anything I consider something a potential partner should know about me (I like to travel, my friends are important to me, etc)<br>  <br>  Everything that happens to you helps make you who you are. If you want nothing more than a list of stats and likes/dislikes you aren't going to get nearly the amount of valuable info you can get from all those pics.|`|hHndD5SEaa	Im not sure why they would need to put pics of their friends up on a dating site either...

zwbldiV0aa	It's not what we think that matters. If you don't want to do something becasue it makes you uncomfortable then don't do it. <br>  <br>  Anyone who tries to manipulate you into agreeing to things you don't want to do isn't thinking of your well being.<br>  <br>  You are way too young to have this much stress worrying.Find someone who really loves and respects you and has patience and understanding.|`|ECrHTZbDaa	I think you already know what you need to do.  Trust your feelings on this one.  He may be a wonderful person, but 27 and still living at home?  Continuing to touch you when it makes you feel such guilt?

Good luck.|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	no, do not stay in this relationship...and yes, he is too old for you...you should not feel pressured or uncomfortable in a relationship...he is in a different place in life than you are...have fun at 18, don't be tied to this guy|`|UNFxjNHkaa	get rid of this guy - he has no respect for you whatsoever.

He's wrong for not respecting your wishes about the fondling issue, that I definetly think.  But I can also see that he may want to advance the relationship further, he is a man and is 27.  But don't ever do anything you don't want to do. Don't ever feel forced to go further because you won't enjoy it because you'll just regret it later.  I think you should really rethink your relationship.  Seems to me like you need someone that wants to take things slower....and there's nothing wrong with that.

Some just overcompensate or hide it well.  Truth is, if you are too nice to people they don't value you- slightly aloof and unavailable is always the way to go!  Let's put it this way:  the people you are running around trying to keep happy- I bet they seem slightly unavailable to you!  And yet the people who you don't have to do all this work for in your life - what about them?  So it is all about playing a little game to keep people interested, at least until you've reached a certain point where you can be totally relaxed and take each other for granted.|`|bwyBXDMHaa	I see how people act at my school and it seems like everyone acts like that. they care to much about what people think of them and they try so hard to just fit in! I on the other hand try as hard as i can to not do this. I don't want to be like any of them. I want to be my own person. Be who you want to be not who your friends think you should, just to be cool. I also agree that people are never happy with you. that is one reason why i gave up on trying to be like them. I was never good enough so what the hell was the sense! you shouldn't have to fake being someone that your not...<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Wow, its also great to see people who are 17,18 see that people they go to school with are immature. I have been trying to get this accros to my fellow classmates for years! They just get on my nerves so much!
8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	If he isn't trying to leave, just get some help for your depression, stay in school and start planning...<br>  <br>  Leave when you can do it right for yourself and your child if he will not work on the marriage with you.<br>  <br>  Do not make an impetuous emotional decision about this--you have a child to support.

0udjgaoBaa	You need to go out and do things to get him off of your mind...Go hang out with friends and do things with your family..As you get older you'll have a routine for breakups we all go through them.I was with my ex for 7 yrs we got together when we were 16 and it took me almost 2 yrs to get over him but in the meantime I went out and had fun it helped.|`|sI7gq3B1aa	:'( awww,   guys always act fine lol its awful aint it when you crying and they are lafing its just their way of looking tough. hell be hurting inside but if he likes this girl theres no way you can stop that. or stop them getting together other than her word. but at least she said not yet anyway not sooo soon. ask her to come over and say your not angry with her she probs doesnt want to come ova as she may feel its her fault.<br>  <br>  but you have got someone who will comfort and love you, your family. spend some time kicking back and maybe when your back at skewl you will feel better. dont keep relying on him for company though becuase you wont be able to move on you will be clinging on to him. <br>  <br>  good luck and hope you are ok youll be fine  xxx|`|i4bjQbPcaa	It takes time.

You should just say how you feel to him and see what he says back. If you guys are really friends then you should be able to work things out. : )
9XYir1euaa	Well, I have the exact same problemish. What I suggest is that you continue to be friends with her and still hang out but not so often, and when you do hang out do something or go somewhere you enjoy. That way if you are getting annoyed by her presents you can focus your attention on the atmosphere around you. <br>  <br>  For an example: bowling|`|4b67623de920c421c21d4a2a84b84023aa	are you guys best friends? if just friends maybe just continue that and treat her that she is just you friend|`|ReborK5Naa	suggest doing sth more original and surprising for once in order to do sth different so you won' be waiting to leave!!!

3jQsbszpaa	The best thing you can do is ask him. And if your too shy have someone you and he both know ask him. I hope this helped. Good Luck :-).|`|YHwaJOCTaa	i know exactly how awkward that feels, especially if this guy seems oblivious to your feelings. i'm kinda in the same predicament myself.<br>  i think it would be best to just go out and tell him, if you're really sure of your feelings for him. if he reacts badly and doesn't let you explain, he's not worth it. however, it would be better if you did something and told him, as there are bigger chances of a relationship developing than if you just did nothing.<br>  also, you could have more fun together :D<br>  good luck.|`|dzHbx8Zxaa	just sleep with him and see what happens|`|Fe9isgq0aa	I think you should ask him how he feels about you and say the reason i ask is because i like you a lot and want more.. than to just be friends|`|satZYrlkaa	Well I think you ought to ask him. That really is the only way you'll find out. If he feels the same way, great. If not, then if he is a true friend he'll remain your friend, if not, then its probably best to move on.<br>  good luck

They're rare though.  If you are to do this relationship justice, know that remaining friends and really getting to know each other is the key to a lasting relationship.  You'll change a lot in the next 10 years.  Job, education, independence.  Many marriages don't last because people grow apart.  If you want this to last, take it slow and don't let your relationship change your plans for your future - school/job.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|ZldKA17Iaa	yes i think its possible !|`|3lWXXwnNaa	I believe that certain people are meant to be together, and by the sounds of your feelings it seems as though you both feel that same way and seem meant for each other. I feel the exact same about my boyfriend, I feel sad when he's not around almost like part of be is missing. Good luck!|`|Lwx2syewaa	it's definitely possible to be meant for each other... but remember to take it slow -- if you're going to be together forever there is no need to rush.<br>  <br>  i'd say my bf and i are meant to be... we're older and have been dating longer, but we never rush because we have forever with each other right??|`|ktq7lF81aa	No, there is no greater being watching over every single one of us and constructing our lives.<br>  <br>  It's simply a good match, but don't be fooled, one person can have thousands of good matches...

AA10612715	The key to any relationship is trust buddy. By telling her she can't go to those parties says to her that you can't trust her. And pretty much it has been stated by any relationship expert the person that can't trust the other in the first place is the cheater<br>  <br>  You are being very selfish.<br>  <br>  You are not wierd to tell her to be safe and not go crazy. I tell that to my girlfriend all the time. My gf is still in undergrad and I am in grad school now so we are apart but before she goes out I tell her to be safe and call me if she needs anything. Most of the time she will not cal but I still know nothing went on cause we have a trusting relationship and can trust the other party.<br>  <br>  You need to have some of your own fun. you shouldn't have to rely on your partner as the solperson to have fun with. My current relationship works out and has been my only one to work out as we each allow each person to have their own space to party and be themselves with their friends. Even when I was at undergrad with my girl we would most likely start the night out with our own group of friends and then meet up later. Granted we both had the same group of friends we each gave other the freedom to do what they want and then meet up at the night.<br>  <br>  If you can't trust your girl maybe you shouldn't be with her|`|AenRh1eRaa	huh really? for frat parties, u can usually get in if you got girls with u. <br>  <br>  but yeah, sucks man =(|`|ymqRux3xaa	I used to date a sorority girl when I was in college. I wasn't a frat boy either. As a member of the sorority she would go to mixers, parties and even dates with other frat dudes. She would go out, eat, get drunk and call me at the end of the night for a booty call. I was a poor college student paying my own way through college. I didn't have to spend a dime but I got all the benefits. Badda-bing!
ND1nFEWSaa	send him a card in the mail, write on it;<br>  I would like you to take me to the movies, friday night i am available  sign your name|`|XCJSTQbkaa	go and talk to him when you see him. stop the car and talk. dont just DRIVE by lol
J9IXHDbRaa	First thing I do in the am is put on a sweatshirt over my normal winter clothes (long underwear "silks," and my long-sleeved sweater / knit shirt etc.).  If I still get a chill, only then will I turn up the thermostat... but usually I don't need to, because that extra layer really helps.<br>  <br>  IMO, I don't think he was being unreasonable... but I do understand where you're coming from.  Try this:  instead of going right up to 70 degrees, try 68, then 69 first.  Compromise is the answer here...|`|doM7kDUDaa	have more sex<br>  that will keep you and him both warm and with more money in your pocket.  Times are hard ,  save save save, and have sex more|`|bqkfu6Diaa	As much as he would like to think it's all in your mind, it's actually not. Just a few degrees in temperature can make a huge difference. There was a study done recently that showed companies have the best production rates when they keep the work environment temp between 70 and 74. When the temp was a few degrees colder or warmer, productivity went down. Temperature really affects people whether or not they can see the number displayed on the thermostat.<br>  <br>  In this day and age, there is no reason why one should have to suffer with 67 degree temperature inside their home when they have the technology and ability to increase that temp to 70 or even 72. If he's trying to save the planet, he's just being silly. If he is concerned about energy costs affecting the family budget, perhaps it is time for HIM to compromise. He can do things to reduce energy expenses at home other than punishing his family with frosty temps in the winter. How about switching to a less expensive energy provider? How about checking all windows and doors of the house for possible air leaks? How about adding insulation to the walls? How about replacing the light bulbs with those new energy saver light bulbs? How about investing in solar energy? How about a tankless water heater ($300 tax break if you buy one, btw)?<br>  <br>  Personally, I have switched all the light bulbs inside and outside the house to those new energy saver bulbs. It was a one time expense 3 years ago that has already paid for itself, so now it's all savings.<br>  <br>  It's one thing to bundle up outside, but one should be comfortable inside one's own home. If not, one just might find someplace else to live.|`|pn2t0gejaa	well that sucks for you . we keep it at 76 in winter b/c my wife is very small and gets very cold. but in the summer she lets me keep it as cold as i want b/c I get very hot. we also figure out it only cost about $500.00 more a year that's a small price to pay when you do it for love|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	70 is room temperature.<br>  <br>  You're right. Fighting about the thermostat is silly.  You both need to learn to be more flexible.|`|52e1044b00e7fe6ffc7e96609443787daa	Personally I'd freeze at 70 degrees, but that's just me. I don't think he's being controlling by wanting to keep it at 67 - maybe he's just trying to save money on the electric bill? <br>  <br>  Just explain to him that it hurt your feelings. You'll be over this by tomorrow.|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Can't you both compromise and put it at like 68?  Sounds so petty to fight about.|`|5r2Csdzwaa	If you are paying the heating bill, then you get to turn it to what ever you want. If that DOLT husband of yours is taking care of the bill, I would suggest you look at the monthly bill. Once you see just how high it is, you might think twice.<br>  <br>  There's an opportunity cost to turning up the heat by just a couple of degrees. The difference may be enough for you and your family to buy additional groceries or help pay your rent / mortgage or car payment. <br>  <br>  Seems like he's adapting in the summer by wearing lighter clothes. Have you thought of using a space heater, closing down unused rooms or zoning your living area by closing bedroom doors. You would be amazed at the increase in temperature by taking these steps. We did these things in our home and it made it much more comfortable WITHOUT turning up the thermostat.<br>  <br>  Which is more important in these hard times? You walking around with it slightly cooler in your house (which can be addressed by additional clothing) OR keeping food on the table, a roof over your head or transportation?<br>  <br>  You will quickly adapt to a colder house if one or both of you loose your job. At that point, it's a matter of survival. <br>  <br>  Logic should prevail on this one. It has NOTHING to do with control and everything to do with having more money on hand to survive.|`|f6YsGOynaa	This sounds like the toilet seat argument...it's really a silly argument, but the hostility is a sign of some deeper resentment.  Why don't you ask him what he's really upset about, and what his rationale is for keeping the thermostat so low?  Perhaps he's worried about the heat bill being too high?  Or maybe he really does get hot at 70 (and believe me, it's easier to dress in layers than it is to run around nearly naked in the winter).  <br>  <br>  However, I would say that if you're sitting around and shivering, or if your fingers are so cold that you have to wear gloves, he really should let up a bit.  <br>  <br>  At the very least, you need to sit him down, and 1) tell him that his tone of voice was not appreciated, and that you're not a child to be scolded when you touch the thermostat, and you'd appreciate more respectful treatment in the future  2) ask him if there's a real need to keep the thermostat so low (i.e. heat bill, he gets too hot).  Then take it from there.  <br>  <br>  This is not a thermostat issue.  It's a communication issue resultant of a minor power struggle and a general disrespect on both sides.  Stop acting like spoiled children and communicate with each other.  You can work it out.|`|onbwN4csaa	I pay all the bills.<br>  <br>  I seen my wife  sitting with sweat shirt on and shes<br>  shivering.<br>  I said Why didn't  you turn up the thermostat.<br>  she said that her first husband did not allow her to touch it.<br>  <br>  I said you are not married to your first husband your married to me.

No i don't think you're being unreasonable. I believe you two should compromise-some nights he sets it and some nights you set it!|`|ppF6oSCQaa	The best way to handle this is to go ahead first and put on more clothes and make sure he sees you doing this.

My husband works in the heating & a/c industry.  Trying to keep your house at 70F during the winter is silly.  It's just like the people that try to keep their a/c at 68F in the summer.  All you are doing is adding wear and tear on your equipment (not to mention heating costs) by trying to keep the heat up.  <br>  <br>  Get better clothes.  Invest in some long underwear - yeah, long underwear and some good slippers for around the house.  As for getting cold when changing?  I mean come on, your clothes are off for all of 2 minutes...deal with it!  Why waste the additional energy to heat up the house 3 degrees and then be gone all day...<br>  <br>  I keep ours at 68F (live in CT) and, if we have company over or it's super cold - I'll crank it to 70F once in a while...<br>  <br>  Suck it up!|`|fTiXy11caa	wow, does he typically act like this or is it a first time thing?<br>  I can't believe he is making this a big issue.<br>  I don't see the issue here being whether to turn the heat up or not -<br>  He isn't your Father, he doesn't need to be giving you instructions.<br>  <br>  you are a big girl, you can choose to turn up the heat and put on extra clothes as you see fit. <br>  <br>   If he was complaining about being too hot, it would be a different story,but I didn't notice that anywhere in your post.<br>  Be on your guard and watch out for future behavior of this type.<br>  Controlling personalities just get more controlling over time.  <br>  get marriage counseling fast if this behavior becomes frequent.<br>  If you let it go, it will kill your love for him....|`|p75ZEmjXaa	I know a guy who worked for Johnson Controls for 10 years.  He told me that 30% of all office thermostats are not connected to anything and that they install them so people feel in control of their office.<br>  <br>  He also told me that his wife used to complain it was too cold and she would bump up the dial a couple of degrees every day, from 68 to 70.  One day he opened the thermostat (old mechanical kind) and he bent the needle a little bit, so that 68 degrees looked like it was pointing to 70.  The next day he told his wife "ok, we can have it your way, i've turned it up to 70" and she was very happy and she never brought it up again.

My friend told me a good quote "dont assume, it can make an a*s out of u and me."  <br>  I dont know the situation, but maybe this person just got occupied, or started an epic conversation with someone.|`|SkXyNqcraa	Really, you put that much effort it something so unimportant?<br>  Perhaps they were busy and didn't have time for your shinanigans.<br>  You should really comes to terms with the fact that not everyone wants to talk to you, all the time. It will make the rest of your life much easier.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best regards,<br>  <br>  Dezmonic|`|y0GOP487aa	Yes I suppose you have a right, but its someone online who you don't know to well, so don't take it like the world is ending.|`|iiMQhey6aa	yes i feel the same sometimes<br>  its normal to feel hurt when someone lied to you..<br>  but dont take a grudge<br>  i mean your friend prolly just dont want to talk to you AT THE TIME..<br>  dont over think it :)|`|g9TxgMlwaa	If you want to.. Hey.. they told you they didn't wanna talk anymore.. Maybe they were just trying to let you down easy.. Go find someone else that likes you|`|hdAQKx4Raa	Give him the silent treatment for a while.  Make him miss you.|`|3Xh1w8SMaa	No. Were you talking about stuff that doesn't really matter? That's usually the case|`|ee3b6fc9cb5ff6641a1f0394b22e892daa	why are you spying on that person.. seeing if they really do get offline.<br>  you must really want this person.. =/|`|jXAbTovcaa	no sometims they just feel like doing something else instead of  chatting with you so they give an excuse i do it all the time though =P|`|el8yX5q3aa	You have no idea who he was talking to or why and it isn't your business.  This person was done talking to you and wanted to talk to someone else so he lied.  Lying is bad...cowardly...I agree.    Have you done this to someone else....or something similar? <br>  <br>  I would doubt ANY  friendship when someone can't be honest with you and say....Look..I have someone else I want to talk to right now..can we talk later?  <br>  <br>  BUT he didn't do that.  You were kind of sneaky to watch for him.....and then made a judgment.  Truth is...he was done talking to you...he said goodbye...then he talked to someone else. <br>  <br>  It could have been about homework or work or something.....maybe someone was crying on his shoulder...you do not know.|`|JZkCVHJAaa	maybe something came up with the person they are chatting with or the just plainly didn't want to talk to you anymore and if that's the case don't worry about it perhaps the conversation was dying anyway and life is really too short to get hung up about stuff small like that but its normal to have hurt feelings|`|RZfDrdIRaa	Are they ACTUALLY chating or was it just a failure to go offline!?!?!?! do you seriously have the hots for this person or what?!?!?! sounds to me to be a bit paranoid... but then again, I'd probably ask the same question!!................Don't sweat it!.....really.. People can appear on-line when the're really not!!!|`|cj8iM1Olaa	I'd have hurt feeling if i was deemed unimportant and not interesting and boring too.|`|RD05jXYwaa	i don't know but when it happens to me i feel all dumped on too.tmm you and me maybe? nah i am to old for you!|`|391b730ced14177f22c062a6648285ceaa	yes he/she dont wanna talk to you.
jCeylLsIaa	Assure him of your obedience (and obey him, of course). "Wives, obey your husbands; husbands, obey your wives". Guess who said that...I pray that you guys succeed more in life. May what God put together, not be put asunder.|`|QBFbvO21aa	sweeite first of all we all want to please our men.<br>  but just don't be a pushover or go out of your comfort zone.<br>  if this is something you want...men love constant sexiness, compliments, etc....<br>  but i tend to find out the more you kiss their *** the more the throw you on the back burner, so stay strong..and hot. so he knows what a damn good woman he has and feels he has to work for u too.<br>  plus guys love massages...rub him down before sex, be on top so he can rest sometimes, and sorry to say..act like a porn star on special nights. :]|`|JPApIxo1aa	let him satisfy you,<br>  and that will satisfy him|`|0fygxRHLaa	give him a nice fruit basket|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Well Tulip, there is many things you can do, but to fulfill one of your husband fantasies is probably one of the best ways to show him your love and willingness to please him.  You have been married long enough to know what that fantasy consist of, so start working on making it happen.  Your husband is very lucky to have you in his life and he will appreciate everything you do for him.  Good luck.|`|utbfT0APaa	Only you and God know what is right and best in the marriage.|`|2Hh0RuxLaa	Walk up to him, put your arms around him.  nuzzle his chest and tell him exactly what you said here.<br>  <br>  Ask him if he wants to spank you.  Ask him if he wants to be spanked.<br>  offer to let him tie you up.<br>  <br>  Tell him you want to worship his balls with your tongue.<br>  <br>  Honey there are LOTS of things to do to your man.   ASK HIM !!<br>  <br>  (and you're a good woman btw)<br>  <br>  LD|`|XJdGqqHcaa	hey its four years so you must be knowing what he likes. as being a male we like certain positions and love foreplay which is required now as you have spent four years together. try 2 buy clothes which will turn him on.|`|y4w6ybr3aa	Or you can have him give you a nice fruit bowl..lol|`|f1006988bdbdd7ae5e5276623f046308aa	fruit baskets are good. Or if he is a horse  say it with oats
yPX1E3Bbaa	the email sounds very decent. like he's talking to a friend. but if its me, i'll definitely be worried.|`|abx5VNsOaa	The "any time", "goodnight " & the "sweet dreams" references would be a red flag that something needs to be asked of him.|`|FnGebaOLaa	um... wait for a few nights and look again!<br>  DOn't assume, or tell him about it untill you know for SURE<br>  if you want to be all about it check his phone.
CUB3wUdiaa	well the six years only matters if youre under 18.  but as far as him having a girlfriend, you may want to step back and wait.  if he drops her for you, whats to stop him from doing the same thing to you.  not that he will but that will always be in the back of youre head, trust me on that one.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	be careful with older guys usually most of them like to take advantage of the younger ones. but he might just be the flirty type if he breaks up with his gf for u then he likes u!|`|TtMKPBR3aa	oh boy! since he smiled at you that alone tells you he wants to drop everything and be with you!|`|f8bdbf58f085a611413f7039f0ff211daa	Sorry but I agree with Ryan and Vote for Pedro. I've been in a situation where a guy has a girlfriend and he either cheats on her with me or he dumps her for me. I've learned.<br>  <br>  Guys will be guys. The things that they do now, it says something about them. So if he really is flirting with you or likes you, he would dump his girlfriend for you, right?! Most likely. So now you guys are together (hypothetically speaking) and what happens when he finds this girl that he likes? He will do the exact same thing he did to his ex-girlfriend to you. It wont change.  He has a girlfriend and I think you should let them be. Dont try to break them up because in the end, it will bite you in your butt.<br>  <br>  Oh and also, just because a guy smiles and looks at you a lot, doesn't mean that he likes you. He might just try to be friendly. Or if he sees that your looking at him, he might just smile just because. I'm not trying to sound mean or anything.|`|PE7OS0f6aa	He probably thinks you're sweet, or innocent, and that makes him smile.|`|P7mYy4CFaa	If he has a girlfriend stay away from him,,,and if he is smiling at you while he has a girlfriend already then he will do it to you too. hes bad news|`|KashRDx2aa	do nothing.|`|j1Js4uuTaa	Sweetie, most guys 6 years older than you are no good. Unless you're dating hugh hefner and getting fame & the joy of living in a mansion out of it, I wouldn't go for it! I would stick to 3 years limit at the most. Otherwise you're just on two completely different levels. If he has a girlfriend, and he really cares for you, he wouldn't be with his girlfriend right now. If anything he's just looking for a good time. Don't fall for it.|`|0O6jbsSZaa	First off,,,,, yes he likes you....... i can tell becuse guys will not go out of there way to talk to a girl they are not "interested in""......... just like most girls wont..... would you go talk to some ugly younger nerd??????.....BUT<br>  <br>  ok...... do you want to know what this guy is thinking.....<br>  <br>  ill tell you what he thinks of you.....<br>  <br>  he thinks,,, wow, this girl is hot for a young chick.... and shes young and i can tell she likes me.... i can have sex with her nice and easy,,, <br>  <br>  He thinks.... good,,,, a hot young girl i can have easy sex with becuse im older and smarter....... and on top of it... my girl freind wont even find out... woot!!<br>  <br>  my buddy had a hot 15 year old girl move in down stairs from him (hes 20)........... she loves to have sex and ****.... and he had a girl friend.... who hes was dating for 3 years.... a very pritty girl............ my buddy tryed very very hard to cheat on his girl-friend with this young hot slutt..... sadly, his little brother in law got to her first....<br>  <br>  THE MORAL OF THIS STORY..... STAY THE HELL AWAY FROM HIM,..... HE JUST WANTS TO USE YOU FOR SEX YOU SILLY BEAN!<br>  <br>  p.s im a guy,..... i have lots of sexual experiance..... i know how all guys think... (no matter what lies they tell you)....<br>  <br>   all i want to do is have sex.... thats all i care about... with out sex, only the most desperate guys will stay with a girl..<br>  <br>  .. its a fact sweaty..... its okay to "give it up" ... but not to an older guy just using you.|`|35EDYBKQaa	Have you seen "He's Just Not That Into You"?<br>  They say that if a guy really liked you, he would do anything to date you.<br>  That's not the exact words but it was something like that.|`|rTaaIXSuaa	Back off. He's taken.<br>  I think you are reading too much into his actions. <br>  He is just being friendly with you. I don't see how his smiling at you or his wanting to talk to you means he likes you.|`|HGl8ddWjaa	If he really likes you, he would dump her girlfriend and date you|`|f17RMVa3aa	back off. he's just being polite. <br>  <br>  don't think all the guys who try to talk to you and smile are madly in love with you, just chill|`|bAnyRNZUaa	How old are you...I'm sensing young.  6 years is WAY too old if you are anywhere near high school.  Leave it|`|k1AZtmM1aa	That's kinda scary|`|s4toXmgWaa	it sounds like a lot of trouble. The thing is, if he already has a girlfriend that already complicates things no matter what the age difference. Theres two things that will cause trouble:<br>  <br>  1: Your and his ages. To be honest, i dont even see much of a problem in people dating people older and younger as long as it to seriously persue a relationship. the problem is if he is, for example, 23, and you are 17 or 16, thats a whole different story. Not to be offensive or anything, but you do sound like a very young woman, and I will say if you are underage you might want to stay away, it might cause a lot of legal and personal trouble for you both. Otherwise, it shouldnt be much of a problem.<br>  <br>  2: He's already with someone. If he is trying to fool around then think about how he would treat you if you were in the place of his current girlfriend. To be honest, i've cheated before and it does feel awrful, but at the same time its also an issue that I am constantly making sure to fend off for my curent relationship. he might not think the same. either way if he actually cares about you, he will break off his current relationship on his own accord.<br>  <br>  However, to me it just sounds like he's being polite. If he starts being more flirty than just friendly i would ask you consider what I said above just to make sure you can avoid alot of trouble and possible heartbreak in the future. Hope it works out!|`|tKKlhSgqaa	Well me and my boyfriend are 6 years apart and we have been together for almost 3 years. We we first started talking he also had a girlfriend but he broke up with her for me, so i say if you really like him go for it. But it is depending a lot on your ages too.|`|rey7cUdsaa	do you really want a bf that is going out with 3 girls? <br>  <br>  you would probally rather have him all to yourself<br>  <br>  i think you should move on :) there are TONS of other guys<br>  <br>  good luck <3|`|6xMXZ3zNaa	I would drop him.  6 years older plus a girlfriend. If he was single or dumped his girlfriend go for it. But he isn't so leave him be until he does.|`|4t2rM4raaa	What do you think a guy that is flirting with you while he has a girlfriend is going to do if you start dating him...?|`|ThjUoWN6aa	i think you should respect his relationship's boundaries. And if he wants to be with you, or express how he feels about you, make sure he has broken it off with his girlfriend.|`|QzAdkugBaa	He's out of bounds honey. Either wait a few years when he's not with his gf or find someone else.
AqXadhUzaa	Yeah! Definately. Its scary because you think you know yourself but then you realise that you have no control over who you are...|`|AA11388175	yes, my husband...<br>  when we first got together, i hadn't been with anyone that could "keep up with me", (yes i AM high maintienience), and it was a shock when he COULD keep up so very well!|`|4UAZ6O2Daa	My Girlfriend. After 3 relationships (among both of us) & we never thought we would find true love ever, let alone find soulmates in each other.<br>  <br>  We might have an age difference (She: 35 in May, Me: 23 in under 3 weeks), but this has been the best moments in our lives ever.|`|tsn34pS4aa	when i was 13 i went on a trip to washington, dc. met 70 kids from other states, one of which i started a relationship with and in turn changed me forever. im 21 now and wonder how i would be if i hadn't met him. probably a lot less talkative and confident.|`|HeltFMCNaa	yes 24 years ago now shes going to be my wife. shes was worth the wait|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	yes, my bf.|`|VLa0RlLDaa	Yep i sure have.<br>  Yet i wish we were still together.<br>  <br>  But its amazing when it happens gives you hope.|`|SEi4V7eKaa	Oh yeah.
lZmf4KFdaa	Yes, you were.  She is trying to protect herself.  The only reason you want to talk to her is just to rub salt in the wound.  You are a player and you know it.  So she is trying to get over you, so you need to leave her alone.  Sometime in the future after she has moved on, maybe you can be friends.  But up until that time, just leave her alone.|`|IUXriZQJaa	That's about what it means, and she is being a lot nicer about it than she should.|`|SRzL2Wexaa	I guess you were.|`|T6Dgmxmoaa	Yeah, leave her alone. You obviously hurt her and were a "d ick."|`|IrrAZay5aa	Yeah, you messed up!! I completely agree with Bob S. Not only is she being nice but she has tons of class.
c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	It's more than okay. It's definitely your right, this guy sounds like a jerk and you need to be straightforward and totally blunt with him. You deserve better than to be played around with. It sounds like you're handling it well.|`|WL1cX9rTaa	sure is.. do what you want. his feeling shouldnt matter at this point. he didny care about you before. so why would you be so caring now? theres billions of boys out there.. you can find s good one.
kiJUCYMcaa	me i would prefer a gentlemen, they would treat me better|`|svg71dazaa	I like the gentlemen as they treat you right. The bad boys only end up hurting you and using you. Yes, i am generalizing but yip that's the way i see it.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	A blend of both is very important. You need the adventurous side of a badboy, and the protecting/providing side of a gentlemen.|`|m3Y3KkRmaa	What's your defenition of bad??? Cos for me is someone who cheats and gets in a lot of trouble...<br>  <br>  hmmm.. I like a agentlemen. The guy who's nice and sweet. Holds the door for you.But who is up for anything! Someone who likes to try new things. Someone who is mature and deep. Someone who has strong opinions and I can learn from him!!! But someone who makes me laugh and also has a playful side to him. But not bad cos they will end up hurting you!|`|hHndD5SEaa	Gentleman for me please!<br>  xx|`|J14tPA9Eaa	try both<br>  <br>  gent outside<br>  g inside|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I say.. BOTH<br>  <br>  I like a wonderful gentleman, that knows how to treat a woman, but i like some excitement and have a little bad side! NOT all the time though!<br>  But to me its a true on ;)|`|GQlHjv5Xaa	both, you want the bad boy because he's fun and unpredictable, but you want the gentleman because well... im not sure but al#tleast he'll treat you right aswell as being exciting :D|`|lNmtjtHsaa	I would say both. Trust me I have had my expericine of bad boyfriends and I liked them but I needed a man at the time.|`|qKY3GZEJaa	badboy ;)|`|rLHhZMlbaa	somewhere in the middle...i think of a badboy more as a player|`|2GW5UDJPaa	Its going to be both mate.|`|83IkY4Ioaa	i can confirm that my guy is a blend so they do exist!|`|greVjlVpaa	little bit of both
2fyVDaguaa	i would re-record with a better tune. youre off a few notes
8P64hgL3aa	Some guys only pretend to be perfect before getting married and after they do, they go back to their real person. that's why before getting married it's recommended to go out with someone for at least 6 months to a year and really testing them and getting to know them. Oh and this applies to girls too. They seem perfect and once married they become these evil tigers.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Did you marry a foreigner or somthing?|`|HKkbqlIuaa	Well, I haven't had this problem, but we aren't technically married yet. We've been together for 2 1/2 years (we're engaged). We have made it a point to talk about all major issues such as religion and children. Although we don't necessarily agree on anything, we have agreed on some compromises that will work for both of us. I am sorry you feel this way. If you and your husband talk about it, I am sure you can come to some kind of compromise on these things. The only thing is religion. That is something you can't really ask someone to change. Well, I hope everything works out for you.
QI36SaLhaa	Buddy You just got to think it all out how things could go with each of them and if you want a long realtionship or if you want to spend a lot of time with her and see which 1 of the two girls would you be happy with and will fullfil your needs good luck buddy
j0G4Zz0Yaa	well if i said no thn dnt call or txt me at all<br>  <br>  but if i said yes you could contact me as much as you like as long as im entertained by the conversation i guess<br>  <br>  shht if i didnt want to talk i just wouldn't asnwer it or txt back...you'd catch on...hopefully|`|rLHhZMlbaa	it depends. but i prefer calling!
ZjM0ghSnaa	I usually just look at the guy that i think is cute or glance over. I definetly wouldnt want to be caught, so I wouldnt look at all. If i did, i would imediatly look away lol. If a girl doesnt look back, that doesnt mean she's not into you. Girls look like theyre not paying attention, but they are:)|`|f25peTSXaa	thats not true<br>  if i catch a guy staring at me<br>  ill glance back really quick to see if i passed "screening"<br>  haha and i get happy if i did<br>  honestly i dont checkout guys much<br>  if i do i just glaance|`|g1xY5l2Gaa	sure il check out guys at places like that lol im be like ooh hes hot or hes cute<br>  but if ur checkin a girl out an she looks back at u an smiles (not awkwardly)  thats good<br>  <br>  but even if they dnt look we still notice if someones staring lol|`|KX8oWwDzaa	I VERY secretly scan the area using my peripheral vision... (guys are not so good at this)... Then if I see someone who catches my eye, I'll stare until they notice, then act like I never saw them, lol.|`|AulaPWqbaa	mmm, at the mall, you'll always see me looking for a cute guy. <br>  I'll look, & if he sees me looking, i would just say "hi"|`|c630401eb9baa68dddde8641339b6a29aa	Sometimes if I see a cute guy I'll look at him until he looks at me too... then I make eye contact and smile (:|`|psB5SKjbaa	i just kindah look....and will be like "ohhh...he's cute/hot"....<br>  <br>  but that's pretty much it...<br>  i guess
To85W1Rgaa	he probably likes you. go ahead and ask him out. the worst he can do is say no, and then he isn't worth it anyway.<br>  hope you find what you're looking for!|`|5f6fbccb8643408cbd62a8431b3e5c44aa	just ask him out. he likes you.|`|EALy7X7Gaa	i def. think hes flirting with you and is showing that he likes you too. flirt back and see where it goes from there|`|B7idbFNVaa	When a guys joke around you, playing around you, or trying to EMBARRASSED you, IT MEANS THAT HE LIKES YOU.  This is a TYPICAL BEHAVIOR around FRIENDS or CLOSE FRIENDS.  But what I DON'T KNOW is whether he SEE you as a FRIENDS or something MORE.  BUT am starting to lean toward as FRIEND.<br>  <br>  Well, you should ask him "why is he acting STRANGE around you then lead him to question about whether he see you as a FRIENDS or something MORE like a girlfriend."|`|PE7OS0f6aa	Maybe he's starting to like you.  Only time will tell, but strat returning the signals.|`|f17RMVa3aa	ohhh i hear wedding bells :)<br>  <br>  haha jkk<br>  <br>  dude just go for it i bet he really likes you but make him work for it but make sure he still knows you like him|`|Mq9GSSHhaa	He's acting like a jerk to get your attention. Guys do that.|`|ThjUoWN6aa	i think he's starting to like you. I've learned, although staring is a major annoyance, it's also a sign of attraction.  If he can't take his eyes of you, girl, you're doing your job! :) The whole teasing thing, i think is jus an excuse to talk to you. I say you should start teasing him back! Don't let him have the upper hand! Goodluck!|`|XPdXlkc8aa	He really likes u, believe me I was like this, I used to be friends with this girl and then I stopped talking to her for a year and a half, then I started looking at her and caught her looking at me, so go for it|`|QzAdkugBaa	I think he might like you. Either that or he's being a jerk and testing out his flirting skills.<br>  <br>  You can tell by trying to figure out if he seems to be acting naturally and uncontrollably, or deliberately. Good luck!|`|35EDYBKQaa	I think he likes you.<br>  Go for it.|`|y0GOP487aa	Trust me, he likes you!!!!|`|4bAZW3F6aa	aww....he likes you
sjERiFeNaa	you dont need to convince anyone. ur actions and the way you lead ur life should be proof enough for this person. <br>  just ignore wat they think. its not worth it, and sometimes ppl dont let go of the past. we cant change that babe..|`|P26ekyGWaa	you shouldn't waste your time for a bunch of morons. they can think whatever they want of you but they will NEVER will be like you and you should feel happy.<br>  and you are what you are, if they don't like like it then forget them.|`|5tz405Iaaa	talk to them one time - maybe do something together, show them you grew up or what ever, one time is all it takes, but mess it up again and it could be gone for a while - if it doesnt work then screw them and who cares about them - you shouldnt have to go out of your way to please them.|`|uXAZhWmXaa	well u don't need 2 convince them. if u reallyy  want 2 show them u hav changed show it 2 them by ur actions<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  hope i could help u
C7C3vVeYaa	Your gunna get aids all run from the poof.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	Move on.  It's pretty clear that she dumped you so that she could have sex with her ex without cheating.  What, you weren't good enough to lose her virginity to, she had to lose it to a guy she dated for 2 weeks?  That's enough for me to say enough is enough.
a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	I would feel like if he really wanted to see me, he would stay at the same party as me. (I have a niece named Nallely. Where are you from? My niece is Spanish.)|`|VajrBj7Saa	it doesnt really matter|`|bAnyRNZUaa	I can see your point, but what you are missing is that guys enjoy things differently and focuse more one-on-one then girls do.  While it might be fun for you to just have him around, it won't be as enjoyable for him to watch you mingle with your friends.|`|3QSiLT2baa	I know I'd be upset. u______u
yBnmqLZ7aa	why do you care if you're the one who broke up with her? You probably broke her heart and now she doesn't want to talk to you. Or, she's busy and since you two aren't together anymore, you ARE NOT the priority in her life.
bMIDDAKmaa	she will never be able to marry u?|`|AA10722993	She can't make you spend money unless you let her.  This relationship will never go anyplace, and she has told you so.   She is only using you.  Find a girl who cares about YOU and not your wallet.|`|AA10776535	You better dump her before you have to file bankruptcy.|`|KX8oWwDzaa	A guy should pay for dates and stuff, but you have to watch out for those girls who want you to buy them everything. She can buy her own cloths, she's a grown woman... I mean, maybe if you two were married, and you had tons of money that would be okay, but that's not the case. She should feel guilty about spending all your money when you don't have a lot.|`|YgGi07Rpaa	She's using you its SO obvious, why is she dating you when she can't even marry you?|`|AA11656721	Your girl sounds like a high maintenance person.  If a person loves another they don't take advantage of them.  The couple in real love would share expenses, especially now of days with this difficult economy.  I think you honestly need to think about your relationship.  What does she bring to the table?  Are you the only one giving and she is the one receiving?<br>  Then perhaps you need to end this before you end up broke and heartbroken.  She may leave you when your broke.  You never know.  What is her true motive for dating you, especially since she is never going to marry you?|`|u3arsCiNaa	You can't spend a lot of money again for her!<br>  Even if you love her very much,you can't spend our money again for her!<br>  She doesn't love you!<br>  You have to realized is it your deed are true for yourself?<br>  She is just playing your love and she only think about your money and herself!She even say you may not marry with her because of her religion!<br>  If she love you,she would do everything for you..|`|93546fdb2e067ecf5800cd861c95c57daa	Well it's obvious that this relationship isn't heading into marriage but the worse this is you're letting her take you for a ride... the money train ride. <br>  <br>  You shouldn't feel guilty saying NO because if she loves you for you then spending all this money wouldn't matter. <br>  <br>  Let her know that you love her and that you want to save your money and if she gets mad then you know you got a gold digging girlfriend.|`|WGHjb9tBaa	You need to run away from her as fast as you can.  I understand you're attracted to her and all but you can't let a girl use you like that.  She's got issues.

tcFg1gWjaa	Depends who your with|`|KX8oWwDzaa	It's not that we don't have the same sex drive, it's that most young men are no good at sex.|`|FyqCMrCdaa	They dont man. They like to act like they do cause that is what is socially accepted. Some woman have different views on it though. You have to gain their trust though cause women put up with a lot of harassment day in and day out. That screws up things for normal "gentlemen" but thats how life is. :)<br>  <br>  PS young men are good at sex. :)|`|wol6ECnQaa	There are a lot of possible causes that's behind a woman's decrease in drive. This includes stress, side effect of the medication that they're in (i.e. Prozac), hormonal imbalance, and upbringing. But don't worry, as most women mature and reach the age of 30 to 35, their sex drive increases and their respective husbands at this stage sometimes find it hard to keep it up with them since this is the time when their drive decreases mostly because of stress from work.|`|6fwEF5ATaa	Go for older women. They are usually hornier when they are around 30 to 40|`|53sVKcOeaa	HAHa i'm so glad my girlfriend (16) is a sex freak. Shame hehe|`|vfCB41Usaa	Waiting is for losers, nothing will change, trust me. A lot of young woman do have high sex drive it just depends on who there with. I met a woman that didn't do much with his boyfriend and would rarely kiss him, but when she was with me, she said she was having an orgasm but just being on top of me and moving around. <br>  <br>  I had girls wanting it the same night or the same day i met them.<br>  Its all in their heads. I'm 21 now, but I had girls as young as 14 and as old as 40 want it. If you want things to change do what I have done all my life. Workout and dress nice, go to hollister if you have to. But don't try to get big muscles, try to do a lot of cardio, like the treadmill, jump roping, and all that. You want the lean look. A look that shows woman that you can hunt all day for food without getting tired, a look that you are a leader and you have good hygene. Because girls still have it wired in their brains that they have to reproduce with a lean man, that can walk for hours for food or run from danger, and not get tired. and also have good leadership skills.
1iXvphNYaa	It is a date. You're both meeting to have a potential wonderful time together. Of course, that doesn't automatically mean gf/bf. I get that much. Its still a date. Doesn't have to get serious but one should be wary of ensuing expectations. It's only natural. Because if you're asking to spend your time with someone that means something.|`|PAY58zPNaa	well if its only two of us, and we are both into each other and love each other a lot, then i would call it a date.<br>  if it is like two of us or possibly with some other friends, but we are just really close friends, i would prefer calling it a casual hang out.|`|MxSL6G2Uaa	nope.<br>  but then agaiin.<br>  i'm only 15|`|AuWPMH44aa	i wuld say she into u and wants u|`|iq1EgWkdaa	If both the girl and the guy agree that it's a date then it's a date.|`|2pxGPcxaaa	yes

kUE3Ddktaa	If it were me, I wouldn't alter the train of your gown - a slim-cut dress like that isn't meant to have a really long train, it will look odd. <br>  <br>  If you want to add some drama, wear a cathedral-length veil for the ceremony. You should be able to find one in a lace or tulle that complements your gown.<br>  <br>  Images: <a href="http://images.google.com/images?source=ig&hl=en&rlz=&q=cathedral+veil&um=1&ie=UTF-8&ei=ANqeSaTpBNeitgeBiJSIDQ&sa=X&oi=image_result_group&resnum=7&ct=title" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?source=i...</a><br>  <br>  Then, when it's time for the reception, you can take off the veil (or switch to a short one) and you won't have a bunch of fabric bustled around you.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Believe me you dont want a huge train dragging behind you all the time, I have the dress of my dreams with a 5ft train embroidered and encrusted with sequins and crystals all around the edges, its an amazing dress with 5 layers including under the train.<br>  I have decided not to wear this dress and have ordered another one, this huge train is amazing to wear in church but what about the dancing at the reception ? I have tried and tried to bustle it up but since its 5 layers thick and not one layer there was not one suitable option for me. <br>  Think about the rest of the day and how uncomfortable you would be, especially your first dance with your new husband and the dancing after all the speeches etc.,|`|1hciyvKdaa	the link does not work, so sight unseen, can you add fabric to it, like from under it so it flows longer and look like it was made that way. Can you get netting, and sew right at the point where the train is and cover the entire train and let the nettnig be longer? Cant see the link sorry.|`|uF5Xgtgraa	By the end of the night of my wedding day, I was sick of my longer train!  The bustle broke, it was getting stepped on, and in general got in the way.....<br>  <br>  If I had my time back I would have went with a much shorter train! :)<br>  <br>  Stay short! :)|`|AA11380378	The dress is beautiful as is. Trains are passe (very 80's) and people do not do that anymore. They are not practical and people get sick and tires of them. I sugest you leave the dress as is.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|znq808AKaa	Personally I like the train as it is..|`|jVx7pmCgaa	trains are gorgeous, I don't know if this is possible with your gown but the train on this gown is detachable and hooks in the back where the zip ends or you could make it hook into the end of the corset depends on the back of the gown.<br>  <a href="http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?keywordText=marilyn&keywordType=any&page=0&pageSize=12&style=J1200SA" rel="nofollow">http://www.maggiesottero.com/dress.aspx?...</a><br>  So the idea is that for your photos and ceremony you have your train and then take it off and just have your little one for the reception. No bustle or anything necessary.<br>  Talk to the dressmaker doing your hem, and the shop you bought the dress from to see if you can get extra fabric ordered in, most bridal designers do this.<br>  Good Luck|`|68tZ5fmWaa	The link doesn't work.
c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	I believe the main problem with marriages is selfishness. Most people have the mindset that it is "all about me" and how I can benefit from this situation. People need to lose the "What have you done for ME lately" attitude. Love should be selfLESS.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Even among religious people disagreement abounds regarding the purpose of marriage and the problems with the institution today.  Largely, the disagreement is influenced by one's gender...  The notion that marriage would be as the Creator intended it if women were subserviant to men seems to be what I hear people saying, but I disagree about this.  I think the husband is supposed to love his wife as Christ loves the church and if husbands did this, marriage would be fine today.<br>  <br>  It is not in the fallen nature of men to put their wives above all else.  They must strive to do this and when they do it, they are on the receiving end of respect from happy wives.<br>  <br>  If you believe in a Creator, do you also believe in an end?  The Bible says it will be as the Days of Noah, and in those days, every man did what was right in his own eyes...  I think we're there.|`|efcbee2cde20c31e3cc06fda525c8a6baa	In todays society, marriages are harder to keep because of the ease of getting a divorce, the fact that two have to work to survive and have no time for each other.  In the 50's women stayed home and ran the house while the husband worked for the family.  The couples had time for each other to nurture their relationship and let it grow.  Now, no one is home anymore, they are doing their own thing, its like they live in the same house but are never together.  As far as the creator of what marriage should be, he only has a small part of it.  It takes a lot of work to make a marriage or any relationship work these days.  Who has the time??|`|PeqdWE3waa	If allowed we would have lived together first; because just the overall drama and the actual wedding itself, did not help us as a married couple.<br>  If we had been able to live together in the first place; we may not have gotten married.<br>  We were too young to get married<br>  We were both too spoilt by our individual parents; which meant there had to be compromise in our marriage and my ex believed I was the one to do the compromising ie., work full time; do everything for the household including what he called his marital rights (it was after all just a piece of paper) but I was made to be the underdog in my marriage and was miserable for 16-1/2 yrs. Something I will not allow to happen to me again.|`|qw7BmBq6aa	Yes absolutely.  Too many people think they can live life their way and it will go perfectly.  It never will, because that is not the will of God.  People's hearts have become so selfish, and so closed off that they may never see the right path of life ever.|`|QGuxbItCaa	What is wrong with marriage....women becomes b!tches the minute they get married. By the way, there is no creator.  Maybe a crater on the moon.
l7fyLFFtaa	Tell him. This is the guy friends fantasy - to have his friend who is a girl like him. Trust me, he'll be thrilled. If you two are really good friends and hang out all the time then he has thought about the same thing. On the other hand, if you're just casual friends and usually hang out in groups with other friends then he may or may not be into you.<br>  <br>  Either way, ask him if he ever thought about what it would be like to hook up with you. Test the waters.|`|cj7NTUGVaa	It depends on the way you tell him;<br>  <br>  If you don't come on aggressive about it like " HEY! I know we're friends but we should date! " Don't do that lol.<br>  <br>  Just say I think that my feelings have escalated to a point where i like you as more than a friend.That should do the trick!<br>  <br>  Buenas Suerte!(Good Luck)<br>  Keep in touch:-)
Wy0lUjP9aa	He is probably hot and cold because he doesn't want to make drastic moves because you already have a bf. So he doesn't want to get in between your relationship. He wants to learn more about you is what he is saying. But I think if you really like this guy, then it is time to leave your bf and then get with this guy. But ask the other guy if he wants to be with you first, because you don't want to leave your bf and then this other guy doesn't want you and you will be heartbroken. If you ask him if he wants to be with you and explain why you are asking this. I bet you any money that he will reply with that because you are making moves.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	it means he wants in your pants|`|7HYJG7q9aa	idk dudet thats really wierd but he prob doesnt want u as muchas u want him cause he is on and off and wat about ur bf does he make u happy cause if not then let him go and if this other kid makes u ahppy then go wit him but if they both dont do that then y waste ur time
3e0IjGsYaa	I sat here shaking my head in thinking that there ARE actually questions like this on this site...ok...well...my personal thoughts on this, is that girls, especially in their teen years, haven't had enough experience in this area. Of course, that's not to say that they won't tell you that - they won't! A girl that is with a guy she likes, is, in that particular situation, is most likely going to tell you what you want to hear, which is "I have lots of experience giving HJ's!" This is partially because of the fact that she may see it as a way to keep you around, and she's scared she may "lose you". I know this, because I've experienced it and did the same during my teen years. To be honest, unless the girl is a slut and slept with the entire football team...twice, I highly doubt she's going to know exactly what to do. Same thing goes for guys when you're in that situation. You gotta think of when you first started engaging in sexual activity - can you honestly reply that you knew EXACTLY what should be done, how to make it feel good for the woman, etc? I'm not doubting that you prolly told the girl you were with that you knew what to do, because you were afraid of rejection. Same thing goes for these girls that have been in this situation. To be completely honest, I didn't really know how to please a guy in that area until I hit my mid-later 20's...and now, well, I know exactly what to do to make a guys' toes curl! <br>  <br>  I wouldn't say it's that the girl doesn't enjoy it, but just doesn't know exactly what to do to make it feel good for you. Most girls at that age get their hand on your tool and use it just like that...like an ape shifting a manual car! lol. I'm going to revert back to the statement I just made about your first few times...since you prolly really didn't know exactly what to do...perhaps the girl you were with gave you pointers, tips..? I would suggest carrying a small incunspicuous bottle of lube with you at all times...you can get the small sample pkgs at some of your adult bookstores. Keep it in your wallet - alongside that "emergency condom". Next time your girl is about to give you a HJ, pull that baby out and show your girl, or you do it yourself, put some on the shaft...this may help out on some of the pain that you are experiencing. I know you may not want to, cuz you may feel she should know, but put your hand over hers, and show her what feels good to you!<br>  <br>  Hope all this helps!|`|WZ0jWRasaa	Well, you see we don't have a penis. How the hell are we supposed to learn then, hmm? I can tell you, most guys when the attempt to rub down there do not do a great job at all. I guess only you know how you like to be touched. <br>  If you want a super hand job, find an experienced girl and actually 'teach' the girl Communucation is important, even if it is awkward, and she'll learn from it and you'll enjoy it more.|`|kWaAlV32aa	I must say, it's not my favourite sexual activity. It's a bit boring and one-sided ...|`|QGuxbItCaa	Do be shy. Tell them what you like.|`|eXvfnnMdaa	I know right?|`|dkzsbUy9aa	im a guy and my girlfriend does it good and thinks its fun, unlucky|`|Rgj6kTOwaa	i think basically its because like with handjobs u urself can do it to yourself, perfectly and no exactly what to do and what gets u going, were as say with a ******** u cant do it to yourself so when a girl does it it feels amazing because you dont know otherwise! if this makes sense?? its the same for girls, when a boy is playing with us using their hands normally it feels good, but nothing amazing and we generally think we cud do a better job ourseleves but then when they go down on us its amazing because we cant do a better job to ourselves!! some girls will be lazy about it because it doesnt really do anything for us (sorry) but if you want a girl to do a better job of it then dont come out and say it but kind of guide her to do it, as she is touching you cover her hand with yours and either speed up, slow down, hold tighter etc until it feels right, and also as she is doing it kiss her, and make her get turned on a bit more and then she will enjoy it! hope this helps!|`|lUYeHIWpaa	Honestly, I don't think most girls enjoy it so much, at least not when they are so young as you are, I know I didn't.<br>  I think it's important that you try to tell any girl you are with what you like and what you don't like. It is more rewarding to do something for a person (girlfriend/boyfriend) if you know that you are doing it right in a way that they enjoy. Don't be shy just tell. And if you feel that you just can't tell how you feel and what you would like the other person to do; then you should maybe consider not having sex with that person at all. Sex is about trust and good sex can never come out from being with a person that you barely know.'<br>  Good luck!|`|0gQzs5t2aa	iits boring !|`|iuq9Kjlcaa	Hand Job?  You mean a manicure?  If so, yes.|`|IWKnavZsaa	Maybe to get what you want, you have to tell them how YOU like it.|`|KCpGsN2faa	We aren't mind readers, tell a girl what u want. But do so in a nice, non-arrogant non-assholeish way. If she does something right, let her know. If she does something not so good, say something like "Yeah, that feels nice, but I like it better when you do this." I dunno if most girls dislike hand jobs, I honestly prefer to give blow jobs, but if my man wants a hand job, I am happy to give him one. One question though, if they are giving you pleasure, are you returning the favor? Cuz if not, chances are the girls are going to be less enthusiastic about pleasuring you if they aren't getting anything out of it. Seriously, don't feel stupid for telling a girl how to please you, another thing you can do is ask them what feels good for them when you are pleasuring them, and then they will most likely ask the same thing, if they don't, then just go ahead and tell them.|`|ft8t98Pnaa	Why would you feel awkward telling a chick what you like? How are we supposed to know how you like to have it done? We arent mind readers Each guy is likes something different... if you want it done right... then speak up!|`|5nfqY9T7aa	Well, 18 is pretty young, so maybe they didn't know what they were doing, or felt awkward doing it.<br>  <br>  I enjoy it, and the guy is usually pleased ^-^ No pun intended. <br>  <br>  Maybe next time try giving some suggestions.  That can even be sexy during the process ^-^  Kinda turn it into dirty talk.|`|ISbCiVjGaa	Well tbh, I have only been with one guy but I do belive I put effort into the ones I have gave him :/ <br>  <br>  Thing is if your in a commeted relationship u could js edge her on a bit..you know hints like more..faster..harder..w.e etc instead js sitting thier like :)|`|fe1b76b6a20dce1bd151bf45adbc8d6daa	what the hell? your penis isnt exactly attractive and what makes you think we enjoy doing sh*t like that? get over yourself! and your penis!|`|IWDFArMIaa	moat girls don't enjoy giving guys hand jobs.

You didnt say anything and he got defensive? He is cheating on you sweetie.. you need to get out now...|`|eXvfnnMdaa	hes cheating on you, he shouldnt be uncomfortable talking about the voicemail if he wasnt.|`|uG3GQvGqaa	It's common among people who feel guilty about something, he automatically went into defense mode because he thought you were going to question him. He starts attacking you, calling you insecure and saying you're ruining his night to put the blame off on you. He's trying to make you feel guilty for something totally justifiable, you've been dating 8 months! You have a right to be curious, even to the point of anger. It's good you kept you're cool though, my advice. Start watching his behavior, don't accuse him of anything, just look more carefully. He's hiding something, don't let yourself get hurt. Good luck!|`|2S2onP86aa	Don't be a coward. You are considered his girlfriend right now and hearing another girl in his voicemail saying this, you and anyone else will think that he has something going on with her, or used to at least. It's common sense. I say you confront him no matter how stupid and immature he acts. When he changes the subject, tell him, stop changing the subject and tell me. I have the right to know. I am not to pressuring you, but I've been quiet and said nothing the whole time and for this you accuse me for ruining your night, what am I to you anyway to tell me this?<br>  <br>  P.S: Say it calmly and not in a mad tone, this way he will surely response to you. Unless he's THAT immature.<br>  <br>  Wish you the best.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	i think that's all messed up. sounds like he's hiding something and i don't like it.
ieTOMSbWaa	i was in a relationship like that for 15 years. you make excuses for them. It was never going to work. I thought i was happy but it turns out i wasn't at all. Your best to walk away completely. I tried a few times but ended up getting back with her. In the end she left me and tried to kidnap one of our 3 children. Turns out she got herself pregnant with another fella and went to the police to accuse me of mental and domestic abuse. everything was dropped cause it never actually happened. Sometimes no matter how much you want to be with someone your just not compatable. Good luck i real do feel for you.|`|FnGebaOLaa	ahhh! omg me too!<br>  only I don't HAVE friends, or a job, and if I DID he would make me get rid of them!<br>  WATCH OUT!!!!!<br>  he will deny it one minute than the next be all pissed about NOTHING<br>  if you have any money get therapy, he might have a mental issue that can be delt with! <br>  This is what I PLAN on doing!
a05818703edf627a70c2368c5b12f69daa	when a man changes his bank password, and becomes distant, but is still telling u he may renew your vowels, or he may want a divorce, it means he just isn't sure.sometimes outside influences are to blame, family can influence people. he is trying to keep u there just in case he changes his mind, doesn't really love the other woman,he doesn't want u moving to where he is because u would be able to see whats really going on.so your life must be put on hold until he either leaves u or comes to his senses. he seems to be seeing another woman, this is how my ex acted, not sure of the future, wait and see attitude. and the distance he put between us, as if he were disconnecting from me. i never saw it coming, as things were just fine between us that whole month. he clearly doesn't want u where he is.|`|nX1QW5GCaa	Unless he's been recruited by the CIA, this sounds awfully funny.

So if it doesn't then he can work it out with you.

Prepare to divorce.|`|JF0SIngqaa	it sounds like he is having a hard time deciding what he wants. His marriage or freedom. I think there is more going on then you are aware of and it might be a good idea to hear what is father has to say. He may not want to get in the middle and therefore say nothing. Something is defiantly going on. I would not sit back and wonder. Its not fair to your boys and you..

Its pretty self explanatory. You are a rebound. He knew his relationship was going to ****, and he used you so he wouldn't have to be penniless and without a home. So, you can either tolerate him, or leave him. He gave his wife every thing because he still loves her and he didn't want to go to court and fight over every thing.

Dispite the fact she had the affair, that she denied until she found out she was pregnant, she then tried to kidnap 1 of the kids and reported me for verbal and domestic violance (untrue by the way) So i would be proud of him for that not angry he must have balls to do that. If he hasn't let go of his ex though after all this time i would get rid of him. Its gonna be hard but it might make him choose finally either you or her. Do you really want to be second best for the rest of your life?
8AqePkCqaa	No its the business of motherhood probably. depending on how old your kids are it takes time to adjust. bring her flowers do little extra things to help her. Get gramma and granpa or someone to babysit have a night out. reel her in again like you were dating. also suggest women viagra too. pamper her so she knows you care. little by little it will come back. Ive had 4 kids my sex life was dead. now they're all above 18 and my boyfriend and I have it every day better all the time. put foreplay and pampering to get the ball rolling good luck|`|GVqjcrCyaa	jimmy: im wondering the same thing except its about my man. in the begining it was a couple times a week now im lucky if its a couple times a month!!! I dont understand, but i have come to one conclusion. my man as well as ur women have somthing going on, pick the right time though maybe when the kids are asleep or early in the morning, some women like it in the morning and some prefer it at night. find out what she needs from you and then go from there...GOOD LUCK !|`|VUYcQgSpaa	i m a women and i had recently second baby i m tired in the end of day so you can talk your wife and see in what she is satisfy maybe she tired enough so u must talk with her|`|H8JCTQ3Laa	how about...<br>  <br>  instead of asking us, ask her!!<br>  <br>  go for it, dude<br>  <br>  g'luck!<br>  <br>  :)|`|AqXadhUzaa	Why don't you ask her? <br>  <br>  Im being serious. Y!A isn't going to help much. You need to talk to her about it. Maybe she is tired, or maybe she doesn't feel attractive after having the baby. You need to talk to your wife.|`|nUq4A3Xcaa	It isn't so much what you're doing wrong, but maybe what your're not doing at all and I don't mean in the sack.  The 2nd baby is a lot of added responsibility, especially if there is only a couple of years seperating the kids.  I think you will find (even if she is an at home mom), if you initiate helping out more with the kids, giving her an evening or afternoon just to herself, not you or the kids, just peace and quiet alone, once a week--she needs that to help her remember that she is still her own person and more than just the kids mother and your wife.  Also, find a sitter or parent that would be willing to take the kids one evening--example Fridays for a few hours so that you and her and have date night. Things will get back on track.
gJNxfoJHaa	i study in an exclusive school and what i notice is.<br>  <br>  the popular girls are the ones that are confident. they aren't shy around boys or at anyone. they party.. but that DOES NOT make them popular. <br>  <br>  they dont impress alot of people. some people dont like them cause most of em' are just mean but the others are really nice :)<br>  <br>  another way of making someone popular if they are the "class clown" its like they dont have to try hard to make someone laugh<br>  <br>  :}|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	I'm in an exclusive school where the rich people's daughters go. (I'm not that rich but we can afford to go there) <br>  Anyway, I don't want to brag about things. But I noticed that exclusive school is very different from the normal ones. They're not better, I say exclusive school is worse. There are a lot of bitches, but they are considered so "cool". I don't know why. They're pretty I guess, but some aren't. I guess it's about their social life, maybe they go to parties very often, they have a lot of popular friends. <br>  <br>  I don't know. I think it's just like that. If you're friends with the original popular ones, I think you're most probably going to be popular also.|`|eW3QCsKFaa	Well not to be conceided but I'm popular without trying. I think it's because of who I'm friends with.. But I've always been friends with them so I didn't really have to do anything.<br>  <br>  But I am not sure what makes them popular. The most popular girl in my school is really pretty, blonde, flirts with a lot of guys and is a b!tch. But she's only had one boyfriend.. So I don't know. I think it's just human nature. Her group of friends has a really tight, inseparable bond and I think people just thought of them as superior to them.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/articledetail.jsp?ContentId=ART994" rel="nofollow">http://www.beinggirl.com/en_US/articlede...</a><br>  <br>  I just browsed this website and it looks very informative to me. Not so much as to how to be popular, but more so what it is.|`|JOtgNWrLaa	the popular people really aren't all 'that'. there is a lot of bitchiness in such groups. its the smaller groups, the people with a close circle of friends that have the better friendship.<br>  <br>  a good friendship is one based on mutual trust and respect. i often see a lack of that in the 'popular' groups. hope you make the right choices!|`|hLjTyAYXaa	Its high school and everybody experiences it.

a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	Fireworks are always awesome, you can do a nice display for only for $10-$15k, if that's in the budget. <br>  <br>  If you need a less expensive "wow" factor, try a roaming shillouette artist: the guy walks around with black paper and tiny scissors and cuts out shillouettes for your guests and posts them on white cardstock as a souviener. I had one at a corporate function some time ago and it was a huge hit! <br>  <br>  Also, a roaming close-up magician can be fun if you want a bit of interactive fun. <br>  <br>  A photo booth can create a gathering place as well as memories for the couple and guests. One wedding I attended had a booth that did strips of 4 photos. There was a table with a book and the bride and groom made a sign asking each person to leave one photo for the couple and take the rest. That was cool.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TceoMfrDaa	It depends on what time of year you are getting married. But my best friend had her wedding on the beach. It was slightly casual guys had on white shorts and navy blue coats with Sperry shoes. And the bride and bridesmaids had on beautiful summer dresses by J.Crew. Everyone came in dresses and casual suits. On the beach they that a cookout with lobster, clams, corn, and a pig. The little kids were running around in the sand the band was playing there were lights. It was beautiful and fun at the same time|`|mQSk7fB6aa	Casino games are a fun idea, playing for chips only, not money (but you could redeem chips for drinks or something) and can be enjoyed by all ages.  The games are cheap enough to get hold of - most decent toy stores will stock basic games like roulette and craps mats - and all you'd need is a willing volunteer to run them.|`|dfMDTTUAaa	get the waiters to do a dance!

Serve drinks with little umbrellas, use things like coconuts and tiki torches to decorate.|`|7S1bMK2Caa	Rent a photo booth!!|`|sGP6s7uraa	We're not having a DJ (not in budget) so what we're doing for "entertainment" and in lieu of a guest book is putting out decorated card stock with different questions pertaining to the Bride and Groom and having guests "answer" and then sign their name (and best wishes if they want).  We're going with "What is your favorite memory/story of the Bride?" "What is your favorite memory/story of the Groom?" "What is the best piece of advice you can give to the new couple?"<br>  <br>  We have alot of (elderly) family joining us and thought that this would be an opportune time for them to mingle with his side and my side of the family.  We also hope it would give them an opportunity to reminisce of our childhood and/or adulthood.|`|03n14OLLaa	Are you doing a reception inside or outside? A beachy reception is a good idea, use beach chairs and build sandcastles (A LOT cheaper than ice sculptures), and put umbrellas in the drinks. This will provide for a more casual, laid-back atmosphere. Congrats and good luck!
l7fyLFFtaa	I hate to say it but you deserve to hear the truth, when someone says they won't date you because they just got out of a bad relationship then it usually means they are not interested in you like that. She just wants to be friends but is afraid of hurting your feelings if she tells you the truth.<br>  <br>  This doesn't mean that it will never happen between you two, it just isn't going to happen now.<br>  <br>  This is from my own experience.|`|9iXGakohaa	Wait some more and gauge how she is feeling and how she reacts to you. Maybe you could start acting like you are interested without really pushing her so she doesn't get upset.

l7fyLFFtaa	I used to do the same thing. After about three months I would break up before I could get dumped. (abandonment issues) Then it happened to me and I realized how damaging that belief was in my life. When it happened to me the girl asked me out again about a month later telling me how sorry she was and how she made a mistake. I was happy to get back together with her. I would just caution you not to seem desperate or needy. That is a huge turn off for guys. Other than that I can't see why he wouldn't get back together with you.<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6h0eCVwpaa	Well....tell him how sorry you are, how much you love him, and explain him everything. He'll probably understand. But be careful!! ALWAYS !!! I'm not saying that he is a bad guy, don't get me wrong, it's just that the sometimes the guys who seem really nice are the ones who are just hiding under a mask, to get girls and then they hurt him....but you know the guy better, so just go and talk to him.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped, good luck :)|`|9iXGakohaa	Just approach him about it.

4QddVQ55aa	Being a Marine's wife is hard. Honestly, I think it's the hardest job in the Marine Corps, but that's just my opinion. <br>  Is she ready to get stationed to places she is going to hate probably hundreds of miles from you?  Is she ready to be alone probably for 7 months to a year?  Is she ready to handle the stress of not being able to talk to him for up to 2 weeks at a time when he's in Iraq? Is she ready to support him 100% because most of the decisions he makes is not going to be his choice...like the hours he works, where he gets stationed.  That's just the reality. I'm not trying to be harsh or negative. <br>  20 years old is very very very young.  Believe me. I know. I got married at 19.  My husband joined the Marine Corps at 20.  In saying that, young couples do it all the time and make it work. And they are doing just fine. My hubby and I are a good example of that.....but it take very hard work and alot of dedication. So....|`|S0iqDSSPaa	If she isn't willing to accept him if he comes back injured then she has no real reason to marry him anyway.

If they decide that marriage os the right thing for them, all you can do is give them your approval and support. It doesn't matter if YOU think they are ready. What matters is that THEY think they are ready. And while the Marines don't have groups for future wives, they do have support groups for wives. She would not be alone in her marriage.|`|GrCj35muaa	If they decide to get married, it is up to them and no one else. You can't tell her she isn't ready because she probably won't listen. Also, the wives benefit very much as far as medical and financial goes. The chances of him getting hurt isn't as likely as say 4 or 5 years ago but to be honest, I don't think any woman could handle that sort of thing very well.

71VRvldJaa	Contrary to public opinion, you can still be intimate and not have an orgasm.  How nice that you have a girl who will actually admit she hasn't had one.  The majority of girls will lie and fake it!<br>  I was married for 6 years before I had my first orgasm.  The key is to not put pressure on yourself to try to MAKE her have one because that will put pressure on her to HAVE one and both of you will end up stressed and frustrated.  A good, successful, intimate sexual relationship between a loving couple doesn't just happen.  Just take it slow, learn about each other's bodies and explore all the "nooks and crannies".  Some day when you least expect it, it will happen.<br>  Also, I'm sure you'll get answers that will suggest "toys" and other artificial methods.  You don't need toys to have an orgasm....you need a loving, caring partner who will be patient until it happens!|`|x7uYAPaSaa	Its properly the fact that she does/did lack confidence that she never has.

AA10057192	If it makes you uncomfortable to know these things about your parents' financial issues then you should tell them not to tell you about them. I personally have always had to pry these things from my parents... but that's because they would get angry at me for no apparent reason (like "mom, can I have some lunch money for this week?" "Ugh! Fine, take all my money". That was pretty much my adolescence in a nutshell.) <br>  <br>  13 is pretty young to have to deal with your family's financial woes, especially smack dab in the middle of the worst economy in generations. Good luck, nothing drives families apart quite like money.|`|Sxlcyua5aa	Parents are not perfect.   You need to realize this.   They only know what they have been taught by their parents and what they learned through school.  Just talk to them and tell them how what they are saying is affecting you.   Then they will think twice before talking about their financial situation in front of you.   They are just worried like most americans, because we have never lived through a time such as this.   The news on TV is enough to scare anybody who listens to it.   Just remember that nothing is ever as bad as it seems.   We will all get through this.   We will all learn from this, and we will all be better at our finances after this.    Your main priority is to do well at school and to go to college.   Choose a career that will put you in a good financial position once you are an adult.   Just use this opportunity as a wake up call to improve yourself so you will not have similar issues in the future.   Use this time to your advantage and learn from it.   Take a deep breath, blow it out, and let it go.   There is nothing you can do right now that will change the situation, so don't worry about it.   Good luck.|`|AA11303010	OK no it is not wrong per se-they are trying to keep you in the loop, trying to increase your understanding so that you too will one day have a grasp on finances. A kid without anxiety should be able to join that family conversation/concern with minimal issues.<br>  However they don't know what a strong reaction you are having, so you need to talk to them pronto. What they are DOING is not bad, but the fact that they are doing it to someone who has such a reaction to it IS bad. But honey, they can't fix that unless you tell them, OK? Just take a deep breath and tell them the truth. <br>  BUT I also want to say, that when they stop, you are probably going to have anxiety still. This is inside of you, it just so happens that right now they money seems to be bringing it out. More than likely when it's not that, it will be something else. There are medications that can help with panic and anxiety so talk to your parents and your doctor.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	maybe you are over reacting to their problems..its better you know some of the problem than not..anyway its up to them to make solutions|`|HO5lWoNDaa	I think they are doing the right thing by telling you. After all they are just being honest with you. Perhaps you should find a way of dealing with your anxiety such as a sport or hobby, this will keep you busy, allow you to make new friends and realise that there is a life outside all the adult financial concerns.<br>  <br>  Remember, there is a huge credit crunch on at the moment and alot of people are finding things difficult and money a bit tight right now so please do not think that your family is the only one just managing to cope.<br>  <br>  Just think, imagine if your ended up homeless, I am sure the first thing you would say to your parents is "why didnt you tell me"
eSKPkbayaa	You could make something. I'm sure she'll appreciate what you've made cos its your time you spent making it for her. It could be a cake or muffin to a huge hand made card.

You are going to have to accept the situation as it is - they are a package deal.  When the little voice goes off in your head - fire back at it with a - "Children deserve to be loved and blood does not make a family."  Eventually you'll accept it - if you can't then you should move on...|`|7i6qj4OXaa	Trust me it's far worse for the child's mother than it is for you.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	, You have to do what works for you. That's my suggestion|`|0U2f9dwLaa	I am a divorced women with kids and have dealt with this situation many times, but from the other perspective.  You need to try to accept that his ex and him will always be connected through their kids but his heart belongs to you.  Being jealous will do nothing but make him run in the opposite direction. Trust me i've seen it happen many times. She probably only is interested the well being of her child.  I know it's hard but try to look at it from her side.  She may be jealous worried that her daughter will become closer to you.  Try to get to know her.  My ex's new wife and I are actually friends.  It was hard getting to this place but it is so much better for everyone especially the kids.  Sure we don't agree on everything but we make decisions together.|`|xQnkYyocaa	You should have love for this child like she is your own. Thats what your boyfriend would want. Yes, she has a mother, but you can be a good friend to this little girl. Dont be jealous, this little girl can make things alot better in your life. Children brighten our lives. Love her, care for her, and don't worry about her mother, she feels same way about you.|`|paBZp7dwaa	His daughter was concieved in a previous relationship, so remind yourself of that.Don't get jealous of the fact that he has a child try to get to know her and remember you are his future.|`|DIihJrUiaa	Just keep reminding yourself that his romantic relationship with her is in the past and he has chosen to be with you. He sounds like a good father and a good man so try to have some faith in him.|`|TWCQCSfRaa	Get used to it.  He shares a child with this woman.  As long as this man is in your life....so is the mother of his child.  Keep remembering that you're his number one.  She had him once but now he's yours.|`|N5v2j6hPaa	if you have to cope then you might need to rethink this relationship.  You are talking a lifetime comittment to his daughter and he will have to have some sort of relationship with the childs mother for atleast 14 more years.  <br>  <br>  Would it matter if this child was one that he (no woman in pic) adopted?  Would you be upset still that you were not the childs mother? No you would probably go crazy over her..  What Im stating is, will your resentment eventually turn to the child because of his past relationship with her mother?  ... just understand what your getting into...and you and your bf need to talk about how you are feeling before it grows more than it has.  <br>  <br>  Now to the lighter side...It sounds like this man loves you enough to bring you into his most precious things life (his child)....let his past go...he is with you now, enjoy being a mom without all the aches and pains, weight and labor lol...thank his ex everyday for giving you time and trust... to spend with this wonderful child.  Maybe you might see things different...|`|SOv6I9Wfaa	This is a tough one and you just have to suck it up. Your 'boyfriend' is no boy - he is a man and he created a child with someone who isn't you. That child has first call on both father and mother. That bond and that duty will and must always come first with him. When you get involved with a man who already has a family, that part of his life is not going to go away. However, you're the one he is living with, not his daughter's mother, so there seems no need to be jealous on that score. Maybe it's time you thought of having a child of your own?|`|ieTOMSbWaa	Fair play to you for admitting that yu feel that way and you have told him. Its natural i hve a step daughter and always woundered if when i had more if i would love them anymore than i do her. I dont.

Even if you think they know it, be sure to tell them what a good job they did on things, tell them you're proud when they accomplish something...but don't just tell them how proud you are over random crap...they'll probably realize what you're trying to do and not put much stock in it.|`|4JiqK2jtaa	If shes a girl:<br>  Shopping, Flowers, Money, Dinner and a Movie, Throw a party for her and her friends. that stuff...<br>  If hes a boy:<br>  Money. buy him sonthing like a video game or a movie he wants. tell him how proud you are of him.

150esu4Daa	First of all, I am so sorry for everything that you have gone through. Your life has not been easy and you deserve so much better. You seem like an amazing guy and they are lucky to have you in their family, even if they don't recognize that. I really think you should talk to your dad and also your step-mom about it. It sounds like they are very aware of the problem and may have some encouraging words for you. <br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that it is not you that they don't like. They are all upset about what your dad did that ultimately brought you into the world, but they don't dislike you. They don't even know you to be able to dislike you. It seems like they are not very good people either, you've dealt with your fair share of bad people and you deserve way better grandparents than these people! <br>  <br>  I also think that you should talk to your school counselor. You've been through a lot and someone who has some more knowledge about this would probably be a good person to talk to! Hang in there! Good luck!|`|nzY94B7waa	I would not take it too personally.  Some people are just mean and nasty.  You are very lucky to have a loving dad and step mom.  Just be sure you know that YOU didn't mess up his college education.  You didn't ask to be born.  I seems your dad understand that and is taking responsibility.  <br>  <br>  Good luck with everything.|`|wj1dd6NMaa	Tell them how you are feeling when you next see them.|`|fTZbCIeFaa	This is a difficult one... its really hard when family members make you feel upset. My advice would be to be as nice as possible to everyone, try and find similarities between you and them, then you will have something to talk about. Don't just say hello and goodbye, because maybe this is making them feel like YOU dont like them. Be well behaved and kind so they dont have anything to complain about. If nothing else works confront them yourself about the issue or if you feel up to it, talk to one of your other siblings that they like to talk to them. I hope I helped :) Let me know how everything works out.|`|IggGQ4GEaa	I don't really have any advice but my sympathy goes out to you. I hope your situation gets better.|`|VP7KAe12aa	I know what I'm about to say is mean I'm turning 16 this July and I'm going through the same thing but alittle differen't. <br>  <br>  You need to talk to your dad. Tell him start up that this isn't right. I'm shocked you haven't exploded with angre! I would have. It's not your fault that your dad decided to have unpretected sex with your mother. He is the one who screwed up his colledge career you grandparents need to understand that not you.<br>  If you grandparents are nice to your other sibilings and not you; you should just ask them and say: "Why is it that I come here all excited to see my father for once and see my grandparents but when I arrive you all hate me? Dad I understand this is ackward because you've never been in my life before but I'm your child you need to remember that."<br>  Your dad seems like he doesn't know what to do. Your grandparents (sorry for saying this) seem like complete as***** who don't understand that you are there grandchild. <br>  <br>  My grandparents disowned me because my dad cheated with another women. He divorcered my mom to live with this other women. And my grandparents blamed it all on me.<br>  It seems like grandparents don't understand the fact that we are there childerns childern. That they need to give us respect or no one is going to be at there funerals.<br>  <br>  I'm sorry that I went all out on this. But it sucks alot for you that you have to go through all of this. I can relate buf time.Talk to your dad telling him that you love him but he needs to do something about all of this. It's not right for your dads brother and mom and dad are treating like you caused **** when you never did. It was your dad's decision to have sex with your mother to make you. <br>  <br>  Sorry to hear about this. Add me as a friend if you want.<br>  Good luck and I mean this,<br>  <br>  Rebekka

Seems like a bit of a contradiction there....|`|FsXTyGH9aa	Yes of course he has to find you attractive to get an erection but that dosent mean he really likes your personality..although im sure your very nice!LOL <br>  But because you and him are friends he must really like you because otherwise he wouldnt have dont that..|`|CceiP7q5aa	all guys are different.. you did the right thing stopping..|`|53e949fcb6f622d9410af657fd269e0baa	no they dont have to like you..ever heard of booty call? lol|`|AA11786477	In general, men or women don't always HAVE TO like the person to have sex with them. (sadly)...<br>  however, there are exceptions. There are people out there who have to be in love or at least like you to be able to have sex with you. <br>  As far as him getting an erection, that sometimes is difficult for guys to control even when they sometimes mean well.<br>  I'm glad you waited. Good decision!|`|A6CuFmBtaa	Generally guy's can just screw anything to put it bluntly yes.<br>  Although some guy's - the better one's, do have to have feelings for someone. Some guys get excited easier than others and at this point i dont think anything other than sex go's through theyre mind! Tell you what though if I could read a mans mind I would be a rich woman! haha xx|`|pciAGe5jaa	hell no dnt do that gurl that i stupid it dnt mater if he do like u.|`|8AqePkCqaa	guys will screw anything that walks. go for it to keep yourself til your married. but watch out guys will tell you anything to get you in bed then drop you like a hot potato. thats what they live for most of them sex how many girls can they do.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	, Are you going to  surf the web to see if you can find other people with a similar question, sometimes the answer might already be out there. That is my thought|`|2d7abd371ab87a4f15f55617bc710705aa	a lot of guys dont have to like seriously like you. they just have to like something about you or your look, and they can get aroused easy.|`|ivsYJPx3aa	Emilou ....

2add0927fd432feba092329128fecbcdaa	Being a husband and a father go hand in hand. You didnt just betray her you betrayed your children as well.  You shifted the ground under their feet so you could make yourself happy. I get it you both were unhappy but thats no excuse. First you get the divorce and then you get the girlfriend. so to answer your question. yes you are a bad father cause you but that slut ahead of your children and thats never a good thing.|`|POHWTDPRaa	Not at all. Your wife's husband and your kids' father were two different people who both happened to live in you. It is two different relationships.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	No, it doesn't.<br>  <br>  Your marital relationship is between you and your wife.  Your parenting relationship is between you and your kids.  They are exclusive of each other.|`|2cb46ea6e0285a7d419967ceaef6f993aa	No, it does not. At one time I was married to a man who was a horrible husband, but he was a good Dad.  My sons are grown now, but they realize now that both of their parents love them, we just could not stay married and he treated me horribly. (having affairs, verbal, mental and eventually physically abusive.) Both of my sons, who are 20 and 22 now, have told me at different times, "Mom you are so much happier now, than you ever were with Dad."  You didn't say how old your kids are, but my boys were 14 and 16 when we divorced. I even let them live with their Dad, even though the court said otherwise, because I thought he was a good dad. <br>  I'm glad that you admit you were a pig for starting an affair before you were divorced. Unfortunately, your wife will be bitter about that for a while and the kids will realize that. (I've been there I know how she feels).  Just continue to be involved as much as possible with your kids.  Good Luck to you.|`|ed3eK4mHaa	Unfortunately, if you really loved your kids, you wouldn't have deceived their mother. Other people will try to soothe your conscience with, "oh you're the best daddy, yay you," but you wouldn't be posting this if you felt like you were a great guy.<br>  <br>  Good men are honest and faithful to their wives. If you didn't love your wife, you would have divorced her first, then started this thing with the other woman. Your kids are hurt because of selfishness.  I feel bad for them.|`|svzGz9STaa	I think you're asking the wrong question. The question that I'd like to see you asking is, from today forward, how can I be a GREAT father, in spite of my situation?<br>  <br>  One way is to spend as much time as you can with your children. I'm a divorced dad, too, and I have never in 10 years missed a single opportunity to be with my son. Whether that's at baseball practice, scouts, school functions, etc. Before I married my new wife, she understood that when it came to scheduling, he comes first. I had to miss out on several of her family events because it would have meant not seeing my son, which didn't go over well with her family, but she understood. Every minute you spend with your kids is an investment in their future. Study after study proves that children of divorce do overwhelmingly better when they have a meaningful relationship with their dad. For example, the National Education Association had a long study that showed that the more involved a father is in his children's schoolwork, the better grades they get and the less likely they are to drop out.<br>  <br>  My ex-wife would tell you that I was a terrible husband. But even she would have to say that I'm a pretty good father.<br>  <br>  I encourage you to continue doing what you're doing, and not worry about whether she considers you to have been a bad husband. Whatever happened in your marriage was the fault of BOTH of you, not just you. She's using your one big mistake as an excuse for you being at fault for the whole failure of your marriage, but if you weren't even sleeping together for years before this happened, obviously there was a lot more going on, and she surely has to take some of the blame for that.<br>  <br>  In short, no, being a bad or good husband has absolutely no bearing on whether you're a good dad.|`|veZLfnGFaa	No it does not.  There were several reasons you did what you did.  If your wife had been more loving and the romance hadn't left,  you probably wouldn't have been so vulnerable to another relationship.  I hope people don't judge you by the way you judge yourself.|`|CWVBfaPwaa	you want to be there for your kids. like you said you're at every practice/game/lesson and you see them every other weekend. i dont think you did anything wrong. why teach your kids that it's ok to live a life like that? I think you did the right thing and you're a good father. you shouldn't even have to question that!|`|hKyOUVXIaa	You didn't even try marriage counseling, you went out and found a new woman  to act like a bandage for your little owwie.  Shame on you. Your kids will learn by your bad example.<br>  <br>  Yeah your wife is mad, as she should be.|`|1K3IiAUWaa	You did what you did.  OMG!  You are not the first man to do what you did.  Regardless of fault in the marriage you still have a responsibility to your children.  <br>  <br>  Yes children know mommy and daddy aren't happy.  So no matter how society/religion perceive this situation, be judged, then move into a new relationship with your children that can be wonderful instead of fraught with judgment, conflict, etc.  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Our children are sponges and mimic our behaviors good and bad...so be very careful and be honest.
VCz1CtiLaa	I had that happen to me, it's very insulting and hurtful, maybe just talk to them about it.<br>  By the way, none of us are friends anymore.|`|AA11447210	Why would it be unfair? If they get along well, they have every right to hang out together whether you are present or not. The fact that you introduced them doesn't give you the right to control their relationship with each other.<br>  <br>  You can still make a point to spend time with either or both of them, as you choose. Don't be jealous because they get along well...they may have more in common with each other, than either does with you. Be happy you helped each of them make a new friend. ?|`|YHwaJOCTaa	maybe they're not doing it on purpose, and you get caught up in your jealousy. you could talk to them about it, and make a conscious effort to hang out with them, not just stare after them as they head off to hang out together. i know how it hurts, seeing as i experienced this kind of thing before, but it got all patched up because of another friend of ours who practically forced us to talk. the three of us are still kinda friendly, but not as close to each other as before. i think it was communication that helped us stick with each other for all those years until we were separated, though.<br>  good luck.|`|n4ugXhZVaa	No its not my friends were doing that to me i wanted to kill them i was so mad but man that just aint right you need to start hanging out with other people so that they think you dont need them and theyll start calling you|`|mldo1vxYaa	Well everyone has the right to be friends with whoever they want, I understand it may hurt as you introduced them and you feel they are leaving you out, maybe suggest doing something all three of you together.|`|hPj1UJ8Raa	It's hurts, yeah but you are not her shadow to follow her everywhere (vice versa). Try talking to both of them about the matter. Don't fight because that can lead to separation as friends. Calm down. XD|`|hgbfzGSMaa	I think you mean "fair".  Well, not really, but it's a danger whenever you introduce people that something like this could happen.  They obviously found that they have some things in common, and well, three's a crowd.<br>  <br>  Look in a new direction and acquire some new friends, too.  Sorry, it's all part of life.
vSHkZWUoaa	honor
x1Jh7sCoaa	both of you need to show how much you appreciate eachother otherwise you will slowly kill the chemistry<br>  remember when things were sweet - wayyyy in the beginning, i bet you were much nicer to eachother then - try and go back to that behaviour and seduce him all over again.  also more spontaneous sex will make the little things not matter (sorry but its true)|`|Z9oDWMP3aa	I think that when someone picks fights over "nothing" then they are actually angry about something deeper.  He must be carrying around alot of frustation and is taking it out on you.  It would be easy to say that you need to communicate more but communication is 2 ways and he might not be willing.  If you can, try to have a calm conversation about it when you are both in good moods.  Oh, I wish there was an easy answer!!!|`|4DDSD9Syaa	Maybe he's looking for attention. And that is the only way he knows how to get it from you. Or ask him if he is Pmsing....lol<br>  It also seems like he is trying to bring some spice into your lives. Cause after you get angry he tried to make up for it. <br>  Sit down and ask him what his deal is. What is lacking in the relationship cause his approach is not right.|`|e4SflIigaa	You seem to be the problem.... I have a great husband but i would kill for him to wake up in the morning and make me breakfast..<br>  I think you're over reacting and realise how lucky you are|`|RTCKiu03aa	what you need is guy time and woman time you meet up with mates one night he does the same another night he is missing his old social life i think|`|KhyKVLN8aa	Hi, I've had the same problem over coffee of all things.  People show love in different ways and maybe him making you brekie was him telling you he loves you adn you not eating it came across as a rejection of that love.  I agree with an earlier post it defi seems to be something else bothering him, maybe he just wants to be cuddled adn asked whats up.  I know it cant be very nice for you (as it wasn't for me) but I would just say 'look honey, i want you to know that i love you and want to understand whats bothering you'. He'll prob come up with 'its nothing' but keep at it, i guess, Hope it works out!|`|O8TA4tMGaa	Here's a piece of advice I got out of the book "The Four Agreements" by Don Miguel Ruiz:<br>  <br>  "Whatever happens around you, don't take it personally... Nothing other people do is because of you.  It is because of themselves... When you take things personally, then you feel offended, and your reaction is to defend your beliefs and create conflicts.  You make something big out of something so  little, because you have the need to be right and make everybody else wrong.  You also try hard to be right by giving them your own opinions.  In the same way, whatever you feel and do is just a projection of your own personal dream, a reflection of your own agreements.  What you say, what you do, and the opinions you  have are according to the agreements you have made- and these opinions have nothing to do with me... Whatever you think, whatever you feel, I know is your problem and not my problem.  It is the way you see the world.  It is nothing personal, because you are dealing with yourself, not with me."<br>  <br>  Don't take your husband personally.  He is saying and doing all those things because of him, not because of you.  He's coming from a place where he's acting up out of his own need to be right, to feel good about himself and his own life situation, or whatever other reason.<br>  <br>  The whole issue is this: you have a choice here.  You can take it personally or choose not to take it personally.  Believe me when I tell you that the moment you stop taking his stuff personally, he'll stop doing it.  Why?  Because it no longer gets a reaction out of you and, if, by some slim chance, he keeps doing it, he's the only one who'll be in a tiff because you aren't taking anything he says or does personally.  <br>  <br>  When you know it's his problem, anything he says or does will be a present you give back to him unopened.|`|bqkfu6Diaa	Sounds like he is way too stressed out. Things that normally would not bother him are for some reason getting to him. If he really sat back and looked at each situation, he might realize that it's not a big deal after all. But being irritated and in his current frame of mind, these trivial things actually seem to be quite bothersome. Unfortunately he will probably not understand this if you explain it to him. He might listen if someone else does. Do not take offense; it's just human nature. My suggestion is to do things that you know will make him happy and put him in a better mood. And when he gets upset, remind him that you want him to be happy and are constantly trying to do things to cater to his personal happiness and satisfaction in life. If he won't listen, just back away and see if you can have the discussion another time when he is more calm. He may see what you are doing and become appreciative. He may choose to ignore it and continue on his path of destruction. That part is up to him. If it stays bad or gets worse, you might need to visit a marriage counselor.|`|uP08b6K4aa	You need to sit down together and discuss this as calmly and rationally as possible without placing any blame on if you're to get the answers you seem to be desperate for (and I don't blame you!).<br>  <br>  It sounds to me like he's insecure in some way, that he has to put you down so that he can feel in control of that situation, in the event that he's not entirely sure how to deal with anything going on in his own life or with his emotions.<br>  <br>  You could also just come out with the question "Are you truly happy with me" and see what his reaction is, if he says he is, then it's time to explain how much these remarks are hurting you and confusing you as to how he's feeling.<br>  <br>  I hope you can sort this out.<br>  <br>  Good Luck x|`|xNkmK0SHaa	You have very few choices:<br>  1. Marriage counseling.  Personal counseling if he won't go<br>  2. Accept his attitudes and problems and expect them to get worse in time, especially if you become pregnant<br>  3. Get out now and save your time and energy.|`|w29tsXLUaa	There seems an underlying depression here. He has issues on his mind. He picks on you because of it.  The issue may be nothing you have or have not done. He has worries.<br>  <br>  My advice is that you both have a lovely night in quietly and discuss this issue.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	Maybe go on a romantic with him so you can learn how to appreciate each other again.|`|p75ZEmjXaa	He's doing that because he doesn't feel loved and he's trying to engage you with some controlling behavior.

1Z0Lmrk1aa	If it‚Äôs strictly platonic and you know about it then its all good. But he should not have kept this from you . The problem is you found these emails  by snooping right? As much as you‚Äôre in the right to question him about this other gal, it wasn‚Äôt cool to snoop so tread a bit lightly but to inquire about her.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Sounds like he is having an emotional affair. Possibly. Confront him about it, let him know it makes you uncomfortable and unsure of his intentions. If he chooses to continue the communication with this woman and basically chooses her over the mother of his child, then you have your answer.<br>  <br>  Just don't give him an ultimatum. Do NOT say it's her or me. That NEVER works out well. Just tell him honestly how you feel, but let him make the choice on rather or not to break it off with her. Or at least tone it down.<br>  <br>  Wish you the best!|`|0udjgaoBaa	What an a**! I feel your pain my man did the same thing when I was pregnant mainly because I wasn't giving him what he wanted at home Hello I was pregnant sorry I didn't feel like doing the nasty last night.(sorry I had to vent) But as soon as I had the baby he calmed down because I am the type of women to please my man and he can have whatever he wants and he didn't want to loose that or his son. As for some advice break every form of communication that he may have with any other women and have child support papers laying around everywhere maybe that will make him think about his actions a little better.|`|yotUSWcIaa	I think its okay for anyone to help out anyone - so long as that's what it is.<br>  <br>  If he has nothing to hide, then he shouldn't have a problem with you knowing, although he may be a little embarrassed. Ask him about it subtly, so that he says it and not you. If he continues to hide it then confront him about it [if YOU want to]. You'll get to the truth that way...<br>  <br>  And with a lot of people, it's easier to help work out someone else's problems than your own, and can give you a sense of purpose, I suppose.<br>  I hope all goes well :]|`|JIjuNh9Maa	you should confront him about this. those comments definitely seem flirtly to me.
8HmULotpaa	This is a common problem for ADHD kids.  All the normal 12 year old punishments wont work.<br>  <br>  The best punishment for an ADHD young teen or pre teen is actually a time out.  10 minutes sitting on a chair or standing in the corner.  ADHD kids hate to be bored or stay still, but it also gives them a chance to calm down and get it back together.<br>  <br>  One thing that has worked well for severely behaviour disorders 12 yr olds.  Is to remove ALL priveldges.  That means he gets No TV, no computer, no bike, no phone, no friends over, no dessert, no DVD's, no going out no anything.  Insteas he needs to EARN his privledges.<br>  <br>  The problem with a lot of teens is that they feel they are entiltied to so much.  If you reward them for good behaviour it doesnt mean much because they get so much and get to do so much anyway.  If you take something away it doesnt matter that much either, because they get so much else.  <br>  <br>  What you can do is set up a points system in your house.  Points are awarded for good behavior.  Like showing good manners, starting on homework, staying on task for each 5-10 minutes of homework, olaying with siblings without fighting, making his bed, keeping his room tidy, getting through a day at school without being sent to the principal, following instructions the first time he is told and so on.  He can then exchange the points he earns in the day for privledges.  Decide before hand how many points he gets for each behaviour and how many it costs to exchange them.  He can use his points for all his usual daily privldges like TV time, bike riding, desserts or even save up some for bigger rewards like a trip to the movies.<br>  <br>  This was the emphasis doesnt have to be on punishing bad behavior it can be on rewarding the behavior you want to see.<br>  <br>  At first he will do all he can to sabotage this system and not let it work.  He is doing this on purpose so that you will think that it doesnt work and stop doing it.  If he refuses to behave or earn points dont worry thats his problems he just gets no provledges at all, eventually he will realise that life is no fun without them and start to cooperate.|`|1hciyvKdaa	OMG I know this so well, I can remember it like it was yesterday. There was nothing ever I could do ever. Go get a book on adhd, read it, if you like it and he can understand it, give it to him and ask him to read it to learn about himself, and how he needs to help with this. I bougth a book recently at half.com I havent started it yet, but I will be mailing it to my daughter if I like it. Her knowing about adhd alone, the diagnosis at age 14, helped a lot, not always but once in awhile it helped, she became more aware she wasnt a bad kid on her own, it was a chem imbalance.  I would educate yourself as much as possible, its so disrupting, so heart breaking, my daughter won herself a trip to her dads, who lived in the middle of nowhere, I mean super rural and going to a small school, and a calmer lifestyle, got her A's in school,  a better outlook on life, and for once she enjoyed school the schools we had were more advanced, so being the super smart one, (they already are smarter but) made her into a great young lady, she even went into ROTC and got the most awards out of any student theyd ever had. Its tough, I was lucky, I missed the heck out of her, but she needed that major head spining change, and it worked. She is actually giving birth today to her first child, boy I hope that child isnt like mom, I dont know how that would work at all.|`|q2AsDnjpaa	I can't believe there is no punishment that effects him.<br>  <br>  Withhold something he likes<br>  Give him something he doesn't like <br>  These are the two forms of punishment.<br>  <br>  <br>  Take away all his toys,tv, games, etc<br>  Give him only vegetables for dinner<br>  don't allow him to go anywhere but school and home<br>  make him spend more/less time outside.|`|T7qgrOJzaa	Talk to a professional.

You already have one poor child who will grow up in a dysfunctional home. Don't subject another innocent to the drama and mistakes you continue to make.

Even if you or others felt is was a mistake to hook up with the brother, you shouldn't take that out on the baby. What's done is done! I know a lady that had a baby by the same man her mom did. So this is not that bad. Don't worry about others, if you want to keep the baby do it.|`|qeVqBMVraa	i agree with Liza G
TfR9sEa1aa	I am not a "guy" but I wanted to give you my opinion. I am sure you have heard this before " Guys don't realize what they have until they loose it" and that is what I feel has happen with you. A man can have strong feelings for a women and at the same time afraid to commit that happens daily.. but, if there is sexual feelings involve and it happens once so often than leaves for couple months than comes back to play the I love you came.. than No he doesn't TRUELY love you. You see when guys have it good and they think they can get away with things they do it and that's what he was doing with you. now that he sees that you are happy and you can't have any more sleep overs he is all of a sudden confessing his love to you. Yes, he could of realize how much he loved you , because now he can't have you. or its simply hes mad that he cant have sleep overs any more. Guys are very black in white but if a man truly loves you you will defiantly know that he does. So, in all honesty he had his chance with you he didn't want more than sleep overs and now that you found happiness move on and forget the past. Everything happens for a reason don't jeopardize your relationship with a guy that showed he didn't want to be serious. Guys will play the game until he gets you and than fall right back into his old ways, why because he really wasn't in love. Once he is EVERYTHING STOPS.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Interesting,  manda, sure why not?|`|wV3Fs9Ebaa	maybe he didnt know how much he truly loved u<br>  it must be true if it was for so long<br>  he also could hav been shy<br>  if u feel sorrow and want him bak<br>  go to him and talk<br>  tell him how u feel|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	Sometimes we take things (or people) for granted - and do not realize how stupid we are until we have (permanently) lost it.<br>  <br>  I guess it could be just being stupid, really.

She needs to work on her self confidence, which you can help with but you don't need to force it. Just don't let her put herself down and compliment her hair or shoes or whatever from time to time. Eventually she'll believe she's pretty too.|`|sr0vZPQqaa	Can't be bothered to look for link but perhaps she is not pretty so you won't be able to convince her.|`|130df77840211884c0142ac3fabd5beeaa	ehhh average.|`|DVu4MivPaa	what boosted my confidence with girls was that my best friend that i've known for a while recently broke up... and they were talking on aim and i found out that she liked me... while trying to look for the girl i like<br>  Have so much more confidence now i'm probably gonna ask her out soon <br>  wish me luck|`|jCqcb7b2aa	she's fine, she's not ugly that's for sure.|`|zNqOc8lBaa	Good looking.|`|OBtCS10Paa	The same way that you would convince anyone that they pretty

If you're keep getting hurt, then you probably fall in love with the person faster and more deep than they do. One suggestion is to NEVER do more or feel more for someone than they do for you. Also lower your trust level. People in this day and age are mentally unstable and their lifestyles are not morally acceptable. So it's hard to find the right person. Just wait and you eventually will.|`|k1AZtmM1aa	Stop dating and enjoy being single.Being single is'nt something you need to fix.Look at some things you can do while you are single.What can you focus on other than a guy?I'm not saying dating is bad,it just does'nt sound like they are really serious about you yet.it takes guys alittle longer to really want a serious relationship.I think a guy that really wants the best for you,and not to hurt you|`|vsOHewLMaa	that seems tto be my prob also..always back stabbed by friends and everything pretty much....but yea...its just tht u trust anyone so easily.. i used to be tht way..i stilll am..but ppl are not worth told anything or trusted now days...everyones temporary...its for liek ahanginout reasons...or relationships for sex kinda stuff or show offf..and all..i dunt know...i have repeatedly been backstabbed by everyone ecxept my family.|`|C7C3vVeYaa	Because you are a pussy and you cant take rejection.

It all depends on the person. She may take it as more. <br>  <br>  Here is an excerpt from www.meaning-of-roses.com  :<br>  <br>  The rose, as the archetypal flower has endured in its beauty and significance for hundreds of years.  What is it about a rose, irrespective of color and size that makes it so special, so touching? In addition to its beauty, the rose is perhaps the only flower that has so many diverse meanings. The meaning of a pink rose is as beautiful and as graceful as the delicate blossom.<br>  <br>  Pink is not just for girls, and it is not just a pretty color. Pink roses have deep significance when it comes to affections given and received. The most widely accepted interpretation of pink roses is grace and gentility. An admiration for beauty, refinement and enduring grace is what the pink rose connotes.  The receiver of the pink rose can rest assured that he or she is admired for possessing a certain respectability and decorum not commonly found in others. <br>  <br>  The meaning of pink roses, as expressed by their lovely color is happiness and joy. Being themselves a joy to behold, pink roses express fun and happiness. The pink rose denotes that the receiver is a pleasure to behold, a pleasure to have in company. Thus, it is an indication of deep joy. They indicate happiness or pride, a heart-felt appreciation. <br>  <br>  The pink rose, because of its happy connotation is very popular in bouquets that decorate the bridal bower. Symbolic of joy, pride and deep affection, they make wonderful tokens while celebrating birthdays, anniversaries or significant achievements. Its visual appeal and delicate appearance gives off a sense of harmony and warmth. Like the becoming blush on a bride's face, the pink rose expresses happiness and enthusiasm.<br>  <br>  Where there are no overtones of love, pink rose seeks to communicate gratitude - a very beautiful and touching way to say a simple "Thank you"! The pink rose when used to express gratitude, appreciation and recognition is a source of joy and delight.<br>  <br>  The pink rose, though beautiful to behold and wonderful to receive also has its share of unfavorable overtones. This negative meaning of the pink rose found it's beginning in the ancient Roman Mythology. Apollo turned Rhoanthe into a pink rose when she unfairly tried to become the protectress of women. In this scheme of events, pink roses depict pain, long standing suffering and death.<br>  <br>  But the pink rose is generally looked upon as the flower of sweet thoughts and gentle emotions. It indicates an affection that may turn into deeper love. Innocent love that has not yet blossomed into passion, a deep affection that has not yet reached its pinnacle is what the pink rose expresses. <br>  <br>  Pink roses please all our senses. They look beautiful, smell great and have a depth of meaning in their gentle blooms. The next time you need to express joy, affection, pride, gratitude, a gentle romance or even good luck, use a pink rose. This glorious flower in its beauty and delicate shade expresses innocence, and a simple joy in that innocence. As opposed to red roses that speak of deep passion, the pink roses are a gentle reminder of affections not yet awakened, the gentle beginning of a wonderful relationship.|`|XSXLWN1yaa	it's depend on that girl how she look at things. it's also depend on the characteristic of ur girl.not all girls love flower but generally girl love flower and they will love more when their beloved one give the flower especially during the valentine. but not all the girls are alert on the  meanings of flower's colour. my suggestion is tell her your feeling. g.luck|`|3QSiLT2baa	Depends what kind of flowers. Some people take it as a different message than others. And it ALSO depends who it's from.|`|To85W1Rgaa	for me, getting flowers would definitely clue me in to the fact that a guy likes me. i would totally love to get flowers sometime- probably most of us girls would.<br>  nice job, you're very romantic. she's lucky to have you!|`|yiEUOwK0aa	it all depends on the other aspects of your relaionship.<br>  what other things do you do together? do these things suggest that she might like you more than a friend? <br>  <br>  p.s. its always been said, your best friend will make the best life-long partner.|`|lTUXdbCTaa	In most cases, girls definitely see flowers as a "more than friends" kinda of thing.

Probably anything but that right?? <br>  <br>  Hmm, what I would do is just kind of come about it casually. I would just tell him that you want to talk to him about something. Then just tell him, you know the wost thing that could happen is that he'll say no, but you'll still be good friends I'm sure. <br>  <br>  Also if you're moving very far away I don't know if it would even be such a good idea to even say anything to him...|`|AvY17Y8Taa	Try to tell him about 1 or 2 days before you move, that way if he has feelings for you, he would contact you.

HSyRWWPcaa	Although a breakup with a with a girlfriend can be really depressing, it does not need to mean that the relationship is over. Even if the breakup should suddenly leave you feeling confusion and loneliness, you may still feel really eager to heal the wounds and jump right back in to that relationship with your ex. If you learn how to react following a break up, and you become aware of how not to strain the relationship even further, then getting ex back will be easier than ever.<br>  <br>  It can seem hard to keep up a cheerful attitude throughout your day following a breakup, but it is believed by relationship experts believe that an optimistic and confident attitude can go a long way. Here are some of the ways that a confident attitude can answer the question "how can I get my ex back?"<br>  <br>  Keep your confidence - If you are asking "how can I get my ex back?", then you should remain confident. Rather than going around feeling gloomy, try to find ways that you can keep yourself occupied and happy. Keep the depression out of your demeanor. Allow your ex boyfriend or girlfriend to know that you are strong and that you are more than capable of handling such an emotional situation, and also that you are capable of surviving on your own as well.<br>  <br>  Remain socially active - If getting your ex back is your primary focus, surround yourself with well wishers, positive attitudes and good friends. Show your ex that people appreciate you, and that they love having you around. As more people begin to feel good about your presence in their lives, your ex will begin to see you in a completely new light. He or she will realize that yes, you are a good person that they simply cannot a|`|WLsS5vxsaa	If you decide to get her back here is a website you might want to check out: <a href="http://www.exbackguides.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.exbackguides.com/</a>

zwbldiV0aa	Oh boy...I hate to see this.<br>  <br>  Your father is really concerned about his fiance's feelings. She obviously is the one who is being immature here since she expects that you flood her with attention even in the presence of your Mom.But you can't really blame her, she really wants to feel accepted and loved by her fiances children which is understandable but she shouldn't be running to your father to complain so that it causes a riff.<br>  <br>  I'm thinking that maybe you could have approached her and made an effort to give a "better" hello BUT I know that you were thinking of your Mom's feelings and it would have felt awkward for you to do that.<br>  <br>  I feel for you because you are trying to please everyone and you really can't. <br>  <br>  We expect that our parents will always behave in such a way as to never hurt us but truth is they are human and they have insecurities and worries and needs to be accepted just as we all do.<br>  <br>  Just let things cool down. I suspect your Dad is getting the heat by his fiance and he ended up taking it out on you. When you talk to him next just tell him that you like his fiance but sometimes it is awkward for you to show her attention in certain situations. This does not mean you don't care or like her.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! :)|`|WDs4fRoxaa	He is misdirecting his anger because of the court matter.<br>  <br>  He is p*ssed off over that, and then he misdirects his anger<br>  toward you to make her feel comfortable.<br>  <br>  It is best for you to be straight forward with his woman if you<br>  want this drama to be over with.<br>  <br>  eg. "I said hello to you in the court. I was not going to get up<br>  and have a conversation with you & get thrown out by the Judge.<br>  I am sorry that you felt like I should have hugged you, but I was<br>  not going to make my mom uncomfortable"<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|JlDcVTVsaa	I would just ignore it.<br>  Your dad will still love you no matter what.<br>  I would just act normal next time I see them, and then if his fiance acts bad, its her loss. <br>  you didnt do any thing wrong, and if she wants to keep doing this she will eventually make your dad tired as well. <br>  so I think you should just act normal and show your dad that she is the one who has problems and not you.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|UNFxjNHkaa	yes, he's being a jerk.  You're his child - you are what should come first, before anything or ANYONE!  Explain to him that you were doing the right thing by not talking in court and How dare his girlfriend make dirty looks at you.  She has no right|`|71VRvldJaa	Yes, under the circumstances you describe, I do think your father was wrong.  <br>  It probably had to do with the fact your mom won in court and they are upset and angry about that.  <br>  I was married to a police officer and I used to go to court with him quite a bit just to sit in and listen and watch.  It would have been most inappropriate for you to stop and give your dad's fiance a hug on your way out!    It almost sounds like the fiance is insecure and is wanting you kids to take sides and she's certainly not going to make any inroads with any of you if she is yipping to your dad all the time about how she thinks she should be treated.<br>  If she continues with this type of behaviour, she's going to push all you kids away and unless your dad is really dense, he should be smart enough to figure it out.....and act appropriately so he doesn't lose his children.|`|Ww5HHN6maa	yeah your dad was wrong, but keep in mind that your dads women has a hold on him. and that may be hard for you to understand, but he obviously believes that the other adult in the situation would never lie to him. it has nothing to do with his bond with you or him loving you. but you have a right to be angry with him. but i would just go right to the source. her. duke this out with her. sounds like this will be a long battle for you. good luck ;)|`|zLXmOXkBaa	Yup, sounds like he was being kind of a jerk.<br>  Your dad's fiance sounds like she's trying to make you like here more than your mom, or trying to get you to pick sides.<br>  <br>  I thought a grown woman would have stopped that kind of childish behavior in high school......I guess not. She needs to grow up.
yPX1E3Bbaa	i understand your situation but honestly i am not saying that you are wrong. but it would be helpful if you just ask your husband to help you instead yelling at him.|`|MsPvIqoraa	o no you were not wrong at all he should have took her and told you to go back to sleep thats what i would have done i guess you should probly sit down and talk about it i hope this helps|`|aez3cIkvaa	If he is away all night working and then gets to sleep all day with the kid at daycare, then he definitely needs to step in and help instead of watching TV like a boob.|`|AA11198190	Seeing you also work as well....he should have taken the initiative and helped out with your young daughter.|`|fmIDB4ZFaa	I see this a lot.  So many men feel that it is the wife'sresponsibilityy to take care of the baby.  <br>  He needs to step up and start helping out.|`|w87jwOaOaa	Been there, done that.  He's a guy.  Most men don't do well with babies.  I know how frustrating it can be when you don't get your sleep.  It will get easier as your daughter gets older but more than likely you will be the one that is the major caretaker of your child.  He will just want to be there for the fun stuff.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You weren't wrong...you just married an inconsiderate man.  You had every right to expect help and he didn't step up.  Let him know however you can that you are disappointed with him and consider his misgivings unforgiveable.|`|atzw0IP4aa	Try to talk when you are both happy and calm. Just say that you are so sleep deprived that you didn't mean to yell, but you need more support. And set up a schedule. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.wrybaby.com/detail.aspx?ID=64" rel="nofollow">http://www.wrybaby.com/detail.aspx?ID=64</a>|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	I'd be calling him every hour on the hour all day from work so he finally sees what you are going thru.....
2sBzrxxfaa	Well there guy, I would have just told her from the beginning how you felt. But it is still a good sign that you two are still close after all this happened. If I were you than I would let her know how you feel and see what comes of it, if she asks about what happened before just tell her you were afraid to tell her the truth.<br>  <br>  Good Luck, but just avoid all the touching on a friendly date!|`|BzUMSGgwaa	just tell her.
f61c6ad75081d1de726d4e9737429211aa	You should use it as a unique opportunity to (without leading him on), to complement him on something that you consider an outstanding trait about him.  This will cushion the blow when you tell him, in some creative way, your interests in guys are directed elsewhere.|`|wMxJDXcRaa	It's really important to get things out in the open before it goes too far. It's also not fair on him if you choose to keep quiet and let him believe that he stands a chance with you. That's leading him on, and you will definitely end up being enemies, so tell him how you feel...and be diplomatic!|`|lhrMI9f5aa	Well if he asks you out take him somewhere where you are alone and just say 'look i like you but only as a friend, I like it that way and would rather it stay like that.' And make sure you say it in the right voice tone and look at him, don't be staring at the ground, he would think that you have something on your mind or are unsure, if that happens he might be continuous at asking.
7d768c46ae3bc8900df03faec5161f4eaa	No one said that it was easy... but you knew he had MS and you married him anyway.  Now that he's scared and lashing out at you, you want to bail?  <br>  <br>  You don't mention it here, but have you tried counseling?  Would he go?  You might have to leave for a short time to prove to him how serious your intentions are.  I would hope that before you do anything serious, you give counseling a shot.<br>  <br>  Now... that being said... if you don't have kids and if your husband really is that abusive, then certainly there's not a lot to fight for here.... so YOU need to decide what's best for you.<br>  <br>  Good luck... God bless|`|6PhSENcXaa	Was he like this before he got diagnose with MS?  If not then he needs help by a professional to learn how to cope with. If this all started after his diagnose then get him help, he needs it.<br>  I'm Chris's wife and what most people don't know is Chris was diagnose with MS 5 years ago.  He did not take it good what so ever, it was hell in this house for about 2 weeks. But Chris being the man that he is he never ever abuse me in any way.  But he did go for professional help in learning to deal with this.  Chris also has ADHD, anxiety, bipolar disorder and sleep apnea. Check out all your options and do what is best for you.  It's unfortunate that he's acting out the way he is.  He needs help soon..<br>  With the help he is doing great now and working like hell to fight this MS. And he never complains about it what so ever.  <br>  I'm not saying that it's easy for him because I know for a fact it isn't.  We both worked up till last year and we were both able to retired at 48 years old.  Which has helped out greatly.  <br>  If this is something that came about after his diagnose of MS then make him get help. But if he doesn't want the help then it's best that you leave if he's abusive.  Don't leave him just because he's got MS that would be wrong.  But if he's abusive, phyically and verbally then yes you have good reason to leave him.  Having MS is not and excuse to abuse some one or anyone.|`|KwNpyp3saa	He may be angry because of his illness. He probably feels frustrated with the effect this illness is taking on him. Have you considered marriage counseling? How about going to a support group of family members who have MS?<br>  <br>  Here is what I found for you.<br>  <a href="http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.nationalmssociety.org/index.a...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.mslifelines.com/understanding-ms/index.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.mslifelines.com/understanding...</a><br>  <br>  I hope these help you. After you tried these and still feel like leaving then you did all that you can and should take care of yourself.|`|yuTue84caa	You can't stay with someone just cause they are ill. Being with someone that doesn't make you happy is going to make you ill. You have to do what is best for you and that sounds like you need to leave. Maybe just take a break from him for a while and get your head cleared and see how you feel after a few weeks of being on your own.|`|R0U4qy6haa	have you ever thought that he is not lashing out at you but at the disease-he feels helpless and does not know how to cope with it- unfortunately it seems like we always take it out on the ones that we love-even though we do not mean to do so-just trying to offer a different point of view to this for you|`|oeEsnwSMaa	Sorry, that you both are going through some changes, counseling would really help.  but I would not keep taking that abuse, he is doing it on pupose, maybe he wants you to leave, but you can't take much of this for very long I wish you luck|`|uec7RIhbaa	time to go sweetie.  you've done your utmost to help him - well now it's time you both help yourselves.  staying with him will make you miserable and your own health may suffer - you're obviously not making HIM happy so i say get gone and see if at least one of you can't have a decent shot at having a good life.  you are clearly not leaving him because of his illness - you MARRIED him (because?) in spite of it and it is he himself, not his disease, that has destroyed your marriage and your own chance at happiness.  get out now and don't look back, you deserve a second chance.|`|RTCKiu03aa	from the way you wrote  it would not have looked good on you if you left him as soon as he fell ill seems to indicate the relationship was on the rocks before he was ill and perhaps you stayed with him to avoid criticism from others but its your life and sometimes hard decisions have to be made ask what will it be like in another five years and then you will have your answer|`|d89qNyb6aa	do not feel guilty!!!!!!<br>  You have nothing to be ashamed of.You are NOT leaving him because he's ill but because of the way he has changed towards you.<br>  I f you stay with him because you feel guilty,you will only end up hating him.<br>  I wish you lots of luck and a VERY happy future xoxox|`|9tf9VF9naa	talk to him. get out of this mess adn move on. you deserve better.|`|AA11180444	You probably will feel guilty.  He could be a miserable SOB because he is in alot of pain.  How do you feel when you are in pain?  Pain effects the way we do things, the things we say, how much sleep we get and so on.  You need to talk to him about this.  If you want to remedy things, tell him that you'd like to go to counseling, and you want him to get something to help manage the pain (meds or pain therapy).  Tell him that if he cannot maintain counseling and pain management, that you will file for divorce.|`|AA12254128	Talk to Him I mean he is really hurt because he just found out he was diagnosed with MS. Communication is the best key. If your afraid seek help with other family members... If you have to get away for a while then go then he will come to realize that your the only one he gots in his life to stick through this hard time... The abuse if it is really bad then leave but for a while so he calm his butt down... and let him come to you... Well hope all goes well Good luck|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	You have to do what's right for you.  Please keep in mind that this is the illness taking over and he may not realize what he is really saying.  If you cannot stand it anymore then leave.  You deserve to be happy.|`|nPa5QFOeaa	its not your fault he is ill. it sounds like he is angry at the fact he is ill and is taking it out on you. <br>  <br>  i would write him a letter, explaining everything you feel and why you are leaving. dont be angry in the letter, just explain your feelings. stay with a friend/relitive or a hotel/b&b for a couple of nights and see what happens. <br>  <br>  he might realise how close he is to loosing you and change his ways. if he doesnt then you should leave. <br>  <br>  being told he had this illness clearly left him feeling angry and resentfull and sour about life, dont let him bring you down with him but if you can help him to change you should.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	leaving as in making a point to wake his *** up and see if he will change... that could be the right thing<br>  <br>  leaving as in divorce is never the right thing... only a last resort|`|7dfa1a36a3ba55081399e73bed8603f1aa	Honestly, I think that even if he did not have his illness he would have become this way. People like this tend to be abusive/aggressive with or without their illness. I think that either way you would end up leaving him. You should not feel guilty, because MS is a very common disease. He has no right to take it out on you all you are trying to do is love him and care for him. You half to do things in life that make you happy to. You need to think about what is best for you for once. Do not worry about him. Maybe this will show him you are not bluffing you are strong enough to go out there on your own. Good Luck!!|`|FasxVeohaa	Well I am sorry to hear this, But just because your sick doesn't mean you have to be angry at the world. That is what it sounds like. Many people can live a pretty good life if they take care of themselves when they are sick. Besides that you deserve better and if he is disrespecting you it is time to really go. Let him be miserable by himself. They say misery loves company...So that is what he is trying to do bring you to be miserable too.Get out and don't feel bad.|`|ieTOMSbWaa	Sorry this aint what you want to hear but ............... you married him what 7 - 8 months ago. You knew he was ill. Help the poor sod. People respond to disability in different ways. My uncle had MS, one day he was cycling the tour de france race for britain. He was very active, good job a really lovely bloke. He felt ill and was told he had the flu after 3 months he was diagnoised with MS. he changed completely for a few years. He was paralysed couldn't even pick up a drink, and it took him 5 minutes to ask for a drink, he become a nightmare, he would swear and shout at his 70 year old parents had no respect for anyone. we stood by him as you should and did when you married him and over the years he come to terms with it and my uncle returned.Its hard for you, but you can put him in rest bite, you can walk to the shop to get some freash air if you want to. You have choices, his are limited. Stand by your man because now he really needs you. Yeah if he is like this still in a few years leave him, but be proud that you stood by him and did your best. Can you really say that now though?
WnbaA1S0aa	It sounds like you worked hard for your current job and it means a lot to you. Would you lose your job if you went away for a couple of months? If that's the case then I would not go. Your husband needs to take this business trip and it will only be for a couple of months. I know it seems like a long time but I'm sure you guys can pull through it. <br>  If your job is secure and you can go then why not? It will be a nice holiday for you. It really depends on your circumstances. It may also be a good test to see if you still feel the same after being away from each other for a little while.|`|h616Cte9aa	Be adventurous, go with him. I moved to The Philippines with my wife and I love it!!! I would never consider going back to the states to live.|`|hkwBR1moaa	Go with him.  He is your family now.  If it's only for a few months, then it should be okay.  Who knows, you might fall in love with SA and his family and want to stay at forever.  Your job in the saloon is just that, a job.  Your husband is your husband forever and he owns the business.  Give it a shot!  When else will you have the chance to do this?|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Your family is your fiance now so leave the past behind and go with your love. I would not hesitate in your shoes, he loves you - be with him.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	It's only for a couple of months right? You stay in NY and he goes over to South Africa.<br>  <br>  Your relationship seems strong enough to weather that gap apart, and you can still call/e-mail each other on a daily basis.|`|w1necKzYaa	Go with him it will only be a few months! try something new I would kill for the opportunity to do such a thing!|`|03n14OLLaa	I grew up in foster care too, so i know what you mean when you want to stay in one place for once. Tell him that stability is important to you and that moving half-way across the world doesn't seem all that stable to you. He should understand. If not, consider what is more important to you: love or familiarity. Perhaps you could make a deal with him to move back after you have been there for a year or so or how ever long makes you comfortable. You never know, South Africa could be like an adventure!|`|n3Agaj6naa	If it's only for a few months I think he should go on his own.  The time will pass faster than he thinks.  (He is planning on moving back to NYC after that few months I hope?)<br>  As you said you worked hard to get into your salon.  If he's only going for a few months it doesn't seem wise to give up your career ambitions only to have to come back and start over.  You could ask your boss if they will give you a temporary leave of absense for a few months I suppose.<br>  <br>  I dont see why he's so concerned about this.  I'm assuming you both trust each other, so whats a few months apart?  I'm sure you can phone each other and do video chat - it's not a big deal.  Besides, think of how many long distance relationships last more than that!<br>  <br>  The only reason I would encourage you to go is if you've always had a desire to live on another continent or in SA specifically, but that doesn't sound like the case.  Sorry but your guy has got to grow up a bit - of course he'll miss you but he shouldn't force you to leave your job that you've worked so hard to get!
9Ni21lHpaa	Honey,you've been with the guy for 4 years,and he wants to marry you.If he needs to go back for a few months to keep the business going how about you 2 sit down and discuss how many months he needs to go away for,he said a couple of months,not forever!<br>  Another thing is,looking at how you guys are going to be married and the current economic crisis i guess he is working really hard to make sure u guys are financially secure yea?That's 2 businesses that he has to run!That shows his determination and guts and wanting to make sure u guys are well off!(its a lot of hard work 2 businesses!!!)<br>  Sweetie!Isnt it marvelous that he says he WONT go without you?He isnt going to have fun there!he's working and in order to keep a happy relationship (the long distance thing can be worrying 4 both partners)he wants u to go with him!!SWEEET! <br>  Another thing is,you grew up in foster homes,and though ure friends are here HIS family is there.I guess you might have to work at changing your mindset just a bit.His family is important to him and since you are marrying him,that means they become YOUR family too.Isnt it wonderful that you now will have not only ure friends that you count as family but also another family that has mom,dad,uncles,aunts,sister,brother cousin that sort of thing?You will get to know them better,and seeing u so dedicated to being him,will move you closer to his family perhaps?You love him so much,show ure dedication to him (and a new family) move for a couple of months.Move to SA for a couple of months,look 4 a job there.How about u have some1 substitute for you at work in NY for a couple of months?Sweetie,jobs come and go,a good man and family dont.Goodluck.|`|d7TV40xfaa	That is a tough situation. <br>  You really just need to follow your heart. <br>  There isn't anyone on here that can help make that decision. <br>  It is a huge step, but think about the step that he made to come to NY. <br>  You just need to think rationally about the situation and think about what is going to best for the both of you.|`|sbWz5qyRaa	A couple of months is really a short time and you'll always be in contact either through phones, email or snail mail.  Our military is always separated from their families for several months to over a year.  If possible, plan to visit him midway through his absence, send cards and pictures.  If you truly love each other you'll be able to overcome this separation.|`|XfuHpwfjaa	You have developed a career in NY and you should follow it.  I would tell her very bluntly to go ahead and take care of his business for 2-3 months in South Africa and that you will be waiting for him when he returns<br>  <br>  My friend Mildred sent me.|`|n5YJS2Z7aa	well, if it's only going to be for two months, then just tell him to go. I mean, it's gonna be hard for the both of you, but it's not going to be for the rest of your lives. you'll figure it out.|`|ETfgBxUbaa	tell him if he loves he would anything 4 u it works 4 me|`|rkEOMr6Haa	If you worked hard to get into a top salon, don't give that up for a couple of months of living in S. Africa.  That is more like a long trip, not a move.  He should understand YOUR job may be lost and then you will be back, so then what?  Send the friend to tend to the shop.  It wasn't really wise to open one business in NY and another in SA.  I can't imagine it is cost effective to commute.  Good luck.|`|s8SZAMz1aa	You are in such a pickle. Here is what I think. he loves you and does not want to go to SA without you, don't you think he should have thought of that before opening a shop in SA and deciding with his friend that he wants to move there? Did he at least keep you in the loop and hinted that he might one day want to move to SA?<br>  You career is in NY when you go to SA you will be leaving your career behind and going to start a new career which will be a loyal fiance of a tattoo artist. Girl, think this through. Remember in sex and the city when Carrie left her career to move to paris? <br>  If you are moving to SA, find a reason other than him to move there. If the only reason you are moving there is to support him and be with him, girl you will be terribly hurt in a foreign country. Plus remember he is your fiance not your husband just yet.<br>  Good luck.|`|2ZfceSlXaa	Let him go and first see if that is what he wants, Then this will give you time to see what you want to do. If at the end All is working out for him there and you miss him that much,Your answer should be clear. <br>    My Friend Mildred Sent Me|`|OHfZFR31aa	If you are really in love with someone, you will follow them to the ends of the earth. Look at this as an adventure. Tell him you are willing to go for a specific amount of time, maybe 3 months, but that if you are not happy you'll move back to NY. I know lots of couples who have moved to their partner's country and ended up loving it. I would love to be able to go to South Africa for a few months, especially with someone who had friends and family there who could show me around,<br>  <br>  But do your research as there are going to be issues with you getting a visa since you are not married to him. You would only be able to visit South Africa for 90 days under a Tourist Visa and would not be able to work during that time. That's something you really need to consider and he needs to be aware of.|`|JlDcVTVsaa	Could you ask for some months of without payment from the salon you work in?<br>  if you can do that, then you can go with your finance and he will really appreciate it, because he needs his business to work so that he can provide for his family ( i know you can provide for your self, but men think they have to make money for the family) <br>  and then after you come back, you still have your job and every thing will go back to normal again.<br>  <br>  its like having a really long holidays.|`|yy45iAbtaa	let him go for 2 months to get the Business going and then tell him to come back.i would not quit my good job to move to s africa.|`|63e59b702150659952a33a58d86bde05aa	If it's only temporary, why can't you look at it as an adventure and go?  Think of what you will see and learn.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	You are looking at all the negatives of this situation and none of the positives. If you go with him to South Africa, you will have the opportunity to see a totally different part of the world, learn new things and experience a different culture. While you are taking advantage of this awesome opportunity (that few people get) you will also be showing your love for him and your commitment to your relationship. And if your friends are really that close to you they will still be here when you get back. Plus you could invite them to come visit you there and they could benefit the same way you are. <br>  <br>  I actually envy you this opportunity. Having travelled extensively throughout Europe, I would love to be able to experience the culture of South Africa.|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	I don't see what you have to lose by going to another country with him.  When he opened a business in another country you should have expected it.  I think you should be openminded about it and go.  The worst that could happen is you hate it and want to come home...before that happens make sure you have available funds in an account for the ability.  Friends shouldn't hold you back from doing something different and unique.  You have an entire life to live...be open to some new adventure.  Good luck
ymqRux3xaa	I think I answered this question before. Anyway, I'm going to give you an honest guys perspective. He is obviously in a great position. He has no commitments with you so he can freely go around with whomever he chooses. He may only want sex from you every once in a while because he's getting it also from someone else. He likes variety. He can roam free because he is not tied to a "girlfriend". Why be tied down by one woman? He's not afraid of commitment. He just doesn't want it and doesn't need it. If I were you I'd go out and meet people. Try online dating. Don't be tied down to some dude that is not commited to you. You should be with someone who appreciates you and not with someone you can't even trust since he won't even pay you back. Sounds like something a loser would do.|`|IPbbIPh4aa	I'm not being horrible or funny but are you sure he isn't gay?
LguXFbvsaa	It sounds like you're in a tricky, and somewhat hazardous situation. You seem to have feelings for him, and hope that things might progress out of friendship and into something deeper. The situation certainly does sound like you're dating, yet you haven't mentioned him saying anything that would imply that he wants to have a girlfriend, or that he wants YOU to be his girlfriend. <br>  <br>  If he was really interested in you, I would assume he would have made it clear by now. If you get anymore emotionally invested, you could be setting yourself up for heartache/disappointment. You should probably discuss these feelings with him... but the fact that you're on here asking and not asking him says a lot about how comfortable you feel doing so... If you have any instinct that he's not interested, I would guess that that instinct is correct. You've made yourself available, and he hasn't taken the bait. He might just be looking for a friend "with benefits"; or a girlfriend without the title... some people like to have their cake and eat it too, and eat other cakes while they're at it. <br>  <br>  If you think he might feel something... bring it up. Talk to him about it and how you feel, and the vibe he may inadvertently be sending off. It's okay to want some clearer definition in a hazy situation. Just ease into it... it  doesn't sound like he's looking for a serious relationship at the moment.<br>  <br>  If you suspect that he is not interested, you should slowly back off until things get more platonic - more normalized. Your situation with him is causing you confusion, and no one deserves to live in that kind of purgatory.|`|4bedkpvLaa	get more friends by joining a swingers club or something it will help.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	He's not using you for anything? It sounds like he's using you for sex.|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	he's just a friend that is using you for occasional sex.
NuUdCz0Laa	I find your wisdom refreshing and appears that you have more maturity than your age indicates.  Your friend is speaking without knowledge of life, so do not take it as an attach, it just shows they have not grown to the point you have in life.<br>  Keep your standard alive, and you will find someone with the same work ethic and attitude, that will produce a very happy relationship.  Good luck.|`|c9a60fdb57c6d0b3e097f61fc57c9d3daa	Tell your friend that it's not wrong for you to seek companionship.  In saying you're looking for someone to take care of you and your children actually says to me that you have no regard for them.  You can't just bring anyone in the house regardless of what they can provide.|`|t9htoO50aa	Is this person really a friend? There is nothing wrong with wanting someone who will provide  for you. There are a lot more qualities to look for though. You want someone who has a steady job.Someone who will love you without conditions. Someone who loves your children.<br>  Don't let anyone with a negative attitude discourage you.|`|WbKBHh8Haa	Never settle for less than you want.  You need to stand by that, and someone will come along.  Good luck|`|Hzf3QK9faa	There is absolutely nothing wrong with wanting a husband who is a good provider. People marry for lots of different factors not just one, we aren't one-dimensional like cardboard. Security is one of many filters people pass prospective partners through whether they are conscious of doing so or not. Actually I once wrote a piece called "Love or Money" based on something to that effect a holy woman said at a bible study we attended. She was applying that filter to what brought people to Jesus. If it is okay for her to ask which brought us to our Creator it is more than okay for good provision to be a caveat for a chosen husband.<br>  I would be insulted too, like take a walk in my moccasins for a mile before you throw around your opinions, friend. However, I would also forgive because Jesus expects nothing less of me. God bless.|`|AA11447210	It's not wrong for you to want a husband who is as good a provider as you are...it's not kewl to want someone to provide for you so that you can do little or nothing.<br>  <br>  Perhaps your friend mistook your meaning and thought you wanted to be a couch potato, instead of meaning you want someone equally responsible so you two can provide for and support each other.|`|SovaFpN8aa	It's not wrong for you to have standards of what you want in a mate. Too many people have low or no standards when they get married - just read the next 20 questions asked in this section!<br>  Your standards are yours. Maybe your friend was testy because your standards do not describe him.<br>  I want my daughter to be in a loving marriage when she grows up, but I also want her to be able to take care of herself.<br>  No, nothing wrong with want you want. Good Luck!|`|NNHdkLDWaa	Because as women get equal rights you can not expect the perfect match up in every way.<br>  <br>  Maybe your lover has a great job, maybe some woman got the great job instead of him. You would not be the first woman to stay very lonely because she waited for all the planets to line up.<br>  <br>  Just like not all men get a housekeeper women need to become flexible too.|`|786cdd812ce5aab02a737d9a44746cdbaa	Shucks no, it's not at all unreasonable for you to want a husband who would also be a good provider for the family. My problem is with any guy who refuses to be a good provider to the family, a good father to the kid(s), and a good husband to his wife.|`|f7f0fd5f021b5d1e4672cdbda2a11ffeaa	Sounds fine to me, you want an equal and there is nothing wrong with that at all. That is the way relationships should be.  You should remind your friend that you aren't like the women in his past and that you resent his insinuations!|`|7u8hX3Hkaa	That issue should be a non issue .<br>  <br>  When the RIGHT MAN comes along , the two of you will <br>  automatically know what to do and how to do it in order to <br>  consummate your relationship . Love conquers all things .|`|fnBPI4OAaa	I want that too! Nothing wrong with that. Don't steal him from me though! :P|`|UdVkkJf2aa	no its completely fine.|`|bIimm8fSaa	There is nothing at all wrong with that.  After all, you have to think about things like that.  What if something happens and you can't work?  Will he be able to provide?  And if you are a hard worker, then there is no reason you should have to settle for a bum that wants to sit around and spend your money!  If you were already married and something happened and he lost his job or unable to work, that would be different.  But we all want a husband that is going to be able to provide for us.  Tell your friend he's just jealous that you are better than all the women in his past.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Oddly enough, men are wired to be providers.  They thrive on providing for their families.  That's why so many have problems when their wives earn more.  (not saying it's right, just saying why).  Men become focused on money, and what they overlook is "provider" is more than just money, it's taking care of children and the home and the yard and keeping the cars clean and running, etc.  <br>  <br>  No I don't think there's anything wrong with wanting to find a husband who is willing to be a co-provider with you.  In fact, I would wonder why anyone would settle for someone who isn't willing to pull their share of the work.|`|tLuALLwQaa	Your question is a very old on,Men fell like if they work 40 hrs a week<br>  that is all they should do.(let me refrain that last statement please).<br>  some men do then what money they get they want to spend on "cool"<br>  things. House work what a joke pick up after them selves forget about it. I am 37 and been married for 9 yrs to the love of my life.I work 12 hrs a night swing shift  my wife is a manager at a store we both cook wash clothes clean house. I belive that as soon as you get all them little "bullshit " things out of the way the more time you have to do what is real and that is love oneanother.I am not bragging I have heard of men not picking up after themselves , bitching about doing dishes etc etc. So no! you are not wrong for looking for a man to help you. Good Luck in your search!|`|qJTS4WBoaa	yes. It's the real world. Women work now. Women have fought so hard for all these years to earn equal status as men, have the same pay rate, same jobs, and fight in the military.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, you can get a roommate to help you out with the bills without having to get married and still keep your equal status and be independent.|`|pJJyH3vhaa	Well, cut your friend some slack if he is bitter about women in his past. Don't take it personally. Maybe you should sit down and explain to him that you're different.<br>  <br>  It's ok to want a good provider as a husband, as long as you are also a good provider.|`|1TgBkiSWaa	It's completely fine I understand what you are saying and what you ask is not wrong its pretty right but when you fall in love and he's not a good provider whats gonna happen then??? He is perfect fr you but he doesnt work Thats when you listen to your heart|`|PWN5rqgxaa	you understand marriage is a 2 way street with both partners sharing the responsibilities... your "friend" is a jackass who was trying to rile you up or something|`|znvx2NMQaa	its completely normal.|`|4e78695008f60b02690030274e8f9ee8aa	Oh my goodness!  I totally know what you mean.<br>   I have a cousin who is a hard worker, has a little girl, so she comes home from work around 7:30 spends a little time with her daughter and husband and the night is pretty much over because everyone has to go to bed.  She works more than 40 hours a week to pay the bills.  He does the cooking in the house which is nice but that's it.  He says he is a writer.  He hasn;t published anything in his 30 years of writing.  After 20 years they are separating.  So, you knowing BEFORE getting into a relationship that you want a man that can provide is right!  Still, I think both can provide, perhaps your friend misunderstood and took your comment to mean that you want to sit home and be taken care of... which now a days is not a reality.  Both husband and wife need to help out.  Unless you marry someone who makes lots of money and wants you to stay home. :-)<br>  Hope you meet the right person. Most of all someone that makes you happy.|`|AA11370204	It is ABSOLUTELY NOT wrong for You to want a husband <br>  who would be a GOOD PROVIDER!  Hate to say it, but You should consider this friend NULL and VOID!!

nUq4A3Xcaa	Educate yourself on his condition, so you can have a better understanding and velocity of the disease--is there anything that can be added to his diet to help as well.  Encourage him, not nag, in a way that will be positive in him knowing how much better it will make him feel.  Let him know how much you are looking forward to the baby and knowing how much you will be able to count on him to help out, etc...|`|H93JbQS0aa	tell him if u dont take medication ur child wont either, do u want to stay sick and not see ur baby! he will shake up lol|`|bZGv0dvnaa	tell him that "u want our baby to be fatherless...."  that for sure should be an eye openner.....|`|W0qFAIVuaa	Tell him as soon as you see him take his pill your offf to the bedroom.If that don't work he is hopeless.
c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	i think it would be ok. you already know she doesn't have any romantic feelings for you. but if she's as immature as she sounds then she will have a hissy fit and be jealous that you're flirting. go ahead try it though. she might realize that she doesn't want to share you.|`|09zVUMBRaa	I would say, at the very least, it's confusing.  You said you had feelings for her & yet you'd flirt w/her friends in her own dojo...|`|AA11275616	no, flirting with her friends is the last thing you should do! she'd be jealous, which doesn't mean she wants to date you either. she'd probably get the impression that you got over her too quickly, or that you were trying to make her jealous so that she would throw yourself at you, that sort of thing<br>  <br>  do you want to hurt her feelings? if you go to her party, go as a friend to her; i mean you can have fun at her party without flirting, no?<br>  <br>  there are plenty of other places where you could flirt, just avoid doing it in front of her|`|ESsQeH8Aaa	Let me see if I have this right ....<br>  <br>  You said, "I couldn't be a great friend if I liked her"    ???    Does that mean you have to hate someone in order to be a great friend?<br>  <br>  Also,  you said your feelings for her are a problem?    I have never seen a time that "liking someone" was a problem.<br>  <br>  I get the feeling your leaving out some detail that would make this rambling of yours actually make some sense.<br>  <br>  One other thing.   Your calling this a "friendship".   Due to her reaction at the resturant, I think YOUR the only one who calls it that.  She might agree with you to your face, but that's not how she feels.|`|jzdhqxPTaa	Yes it would be rude, and embarssing for her and yourself. Her friends will think your a jerk, when your probaly not, and they will lose respect for you. Thats if they are true friends...so yes, it is rude, and ignorant and I would consider it to be immature.<br>  Move on frm her. You don't/won't/can't work, find a girl that will work...and not a friend of hers.|`|eVF7mhE9aa	She sounds like she is afraid of being hurt. Maybe she thinks she's keeping her guard up by not dating you. If she's that emotionally unstable, then maybe you should really start seeing other people. She had her chance, and now its time for you to get your flirt on.|`|AA10950152	In the words of the great Humpty Hump, "do what cha like"....|`|kynzqmWgaa	she doesn't like you so it shouldn't matter. flirt with anyone you want.|`|DKiftd4Naa	She'll probably pitch a fit out of jealousy- but she'll get over it. Mostly because you're her "steady Freddie". You're the one who she can count on to want her and make her feel loved and secure. She needs you to want her because she cares about you and she doesn't want to be alone. She thinks if she "strings you along" you won't leave her. Some girls think the only way to keep a guy friend is to lead them on just enough to keep their attention and affection.<br>  <br>  Girls need security especially when they're in their 20s. Maybe she just doesn't want to let down her walls, be "intimate", or get hurt. She wouldn't talk to you if she didn't care about you or even love you, she just doesn't want a romantic relationship and fear of heartbreak that comes along with it. She may not want to give herself away- she could be flat out selfish and insecure but I'm giving her the benefit of the doubt.<br>  <br>  If you want to keep her as a friend and date other people- that perfect. Just don't change anything. Keep calling and hanging out with her. Ignore her jealous nonsense. When she comes around just trust yourself to make a decision then.|`|LguXFbvsaa	You sound really confused and emotional. You're all about this girl... but you're dating another girl... but you want to flirt with her friends. Figure out what you want, man! In all sincerity, she knows you like her so much, and she probably utilizes that knowledge to build up her self esteem when she's feeling low and unattractive. If you flirt with her friends her big ego will probably just convince her that you're doing it to make her jealous. And anyway, she's probably already told all her friends about you. "The guy that's soo into me", "this guy - he likes me so much", "He calls me all the time, but I just want to be friends". They're going to think you're girl-crazy. And they, I'm CERTAIN, view you as marked territory. They know you've been intimate with their friend... and they don't want to make themselves out out to be a jerk... or be out with one either. They might even all rally round and giggle about how silly that thing you said to so-and-so was. Hmm... ultimate humiliation: multiple rejections by one group of people who all know each other. Smooth.<br>  <br>  Be single and stop worrying about chicks and their opinions of you. The girl is just using you for when she's lonely; as soon as some Mr. Charming stud comes along you'll be having tea with her like a gal pal and hearing about how sweet the thing he did the other day was. He's so dreamy.<br>  <br>  Desperation is a stinky cologne, mack.|`|M9pObdviaa	this is from my point of view if you flirt with her friends shes going to think you want to make her jealous and even though your not friends you both shouldn't dislike each other. im not trying to be rude but i hate when guys say if i cant be with you then lets not be friends it just goes to show you cant always get your way and avoiding it doesn't make the situation any better. If you flirt with her friends she may want to rebel against you by doing the same with some of your friends and i dont think you would like that and the hate would just continue. i think you should be friends but limit your self talk but maybe only 30 min like twice a week just to see how she is doing. Dont try to push your problems away because they will always find a way to come back.<br>  <br>  hope this helped and i hope everything goes well between you two|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Actually, I don't see anything wrong with it. If she just wants to be your friend, it is selfish of her to try to keep you dangling like that. Plus, if she really does have feelings for you, you will definitely see them come out if she notices you have other interests besides her. Go for it!! Show her that YOU have wants and needs just like she does.<br>  P.S. ..... when you get there, make sure somehow, without being too obvious, that she is still JUST wanting to be a friend before you go being a player.|`|SFu6L2Ghaa	Well I'm a girl so..  I should know this..  She'd think tat yu are trying to make her jelous... And she mightget jelous... But seriously I tihnk she likes you as a friend... a Special Friend...:)<br>  Good luck...|`|IcXmZc6saa	why only her friends...there must be other pretty girls out in the city..flirting with her friends and not with her might her...and moreover reading your qn and situation it seems like there are chances...she likes you.first flirt with her and if it doesnt works flirt with her friends or anyone...|`|eaPHafi6aa	you should be able to flirt<br>  considering she says she doesnt like you<br>  but dont overdue it <br>  just incase shes just in denial and really<br>  does like you...<br>  you'll never know|`|OxnFnyqPaa	WoW...<br>  First of all you are not committed to her as a boyfriend, and what you want to do is not considered rude at all. In fact it's called living your life! <br>  If she reacts in a way like you're expecting, then you should tell her that you have expressed your feelings for her and she just wants to be your friend, so you've made up your mind to see other people.<br>  <br>  Good luck and hope this helps! ^__^|`|5nfqY9T7aa	I think a little flirting is okay, but don't over-do it.  You could hurt her feelings and/or get yourself in trouble with her or her friend's boyfriends.
6fwEF5ATaa	Its a major mistake to schedule flirting. Flirting needs to be spontaneous.|`|vwgmh3v6aa	Well, to be Honest i don't think it would be a good idea for you to flirt with her friends, but you could always try and see what happens. This could make her feel jealous and she might come running back to you, or this could make her feel very uncomfortable about you and not even be your friend... its up to you to make that decision.|`|5lfWWusPaa	flirt with her and ask her out one more time if she says no walk out of her life (thumbs down shocker)|`|mRgRDhMQaa	Yes, if she says she doesn't have feelings back it might because she just doesn't want to at the moment. You should flirt spontaneously with her friends and maybe she'll see how she really feels or things will stay the same. <br>  <br>  good luck.
JOQJwcR6aa	If you have to ask this question then you yourself know the answer.Nothing that's right gives you a bad feeling so if you have a bad feeling than don't do it..and for your uncle i would want to be a friend of his ,which he probably doesn't have any..if you feel that strongly in wanting to date your friends ex then there should be no problem to ask your friend this same question to see if they are o.k. with it but once you go there you can't take it back. Just know you may end up losing a friend now is that worth it when there are plenty of girls in the world to choose from..and nothing last forever so if you and the girl don't stay together  you would have lost and friend and also a girlfriend now that sounds sad to me..if i were you i wouldn't go there i'd just stay as far away from the my friends ex as i could..good luck and God Bless you and you friends relationship :)|`|sedCwxOsaa	yea, cept my Dad married my mom, the younger sister of the girl he WAS dating.

m1Yr8EMAaa	No, my husband is a man. He wouldn't let his family down.|`|SsfnitjXaa	My husband will be out of his job March 1st.  A man is defined by his job, loosing it is not the same for him as it is a woman.  You did not have to be there when he was axed.  Being lazy has nothing to do with not looking for a job.  Depression is the problem.  This is where being a wife comes in.  The two of you tackling this problem together.  When one is down the other is the cheerleader.<br>  <br>  Pull together and you can get through this.  Loosing a job in today's economy is not any-ones fault.  Companies do not have a heart, wife's do.|`|MD8YPVvpaa	If he's bad at the looking for the job, but not bad at the interview and the working part, help him out. Put his resume out there for him. Monster, Yahoo!jobs, other sites like that. Depending on his job field there are plenty of ways to get his resume out there. Look up companies websites and send his resumes to the via the websites. If you are willing to move out of state, then look at larger companies in the US that hire for all sorts of positions. Most of those large companies even pay for your move!!!

"I second that emotion."<br>  <br>  Perhaps this is how he was raised; to show women respect.  My girlfriend's son is 14 and is very much into girls.  Recently she sat him down and explained to him that how he treats girls, good or bad, is going to affect them for the rest of their lives.  At this age (and the next several years) when boys treat girls as just something that's there to gratify their urges it can mark them for life (in a bad way).  She spoke from experience.<br>  <br>  Could be that this is his way of showing you respect; he loves you for *you*--not sex.  Maybe he's afraid that if he "makes a pass" at you that you'll respond with outrage.  Maybe he's one of the few remaining guys (and girls) that genuinely want to save sex until marriage; a commendable and worth-while goal.<br>  <br>  Yes, I know, you're talking about making-out and not sex but the former tends to lead to the latter.  Take Adam L's advice and have a frank discussion with him.  And always remember this:  ultimately the girl dictates how far things are going to go.  Once you start down that path most guys will take things to the next level and then the next, if you let them.<br>  <br>  The very best of luck to you.|`|FR1SoLteaa	grab him by the balls, tell him to pucker up, and give hime the most hardcore kiss you can give him.

The last thing they are going to want is a young guy who they assume is immature. <br>  I am not saying you are immature but most young guys of your age are. <br>  I am only 20 and even I will not date a 17 year old. <br>  I will not even date an 18 year old.... <br>  It just depends on the woman and what she has been through. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!<br>  <br>  Oh and make sure they are not married when you hit on them....<br>  Their husband might get mad.

It might be the way you're doing it. <br>  <br>  First thing:  I hope you have a job.  If you don't, you'd better get one. Women that age can still get plenty of sex.  You can't expect them to wine and dine you on any regular basis.  Most guy between 27-35 can offer a woman just as much sex as you can, AND take her out.  <br>  <br>  Women like subtlenes. You might think going up to them and letting them know you're 'hot' might do it for them, but you're probably wrong. It might get you a couple of desperate ones, but it won't wash with most of them. They already know they're attractive, and they know that's why you're sniffing around. They act happy because they enjoy a compliment, admire your nerve, and think you're cute.  Cute, as in, like a puppy...who's forgiven for sniffing their crotch. WOMEN like to know you LIKE them.  You'd probably get further, quicker, if you start off offering to mow their lawns, or shovel their walks/driveways, instead of staring at their boobs and touching yourself.  Work it a bit,BEFORE you hit on them.  <br>  <br>  Then you need to learn how to keep your mouth shut. A lot of people might treat her differently if they knew she was dating someone as young as you.  It could affect her job, or her relationships with her friends and family. You should learn to keep things to yourself UNTIL YOU KNOW IT'S OK WITH HER.  That might mean passing up on the urge to let all your friends know you're 'getting some'.  That's when maturity really kicks in. <br>  <br>  I've got a feeling the offense has something to do with the way you approach them.  <br>  <br>  And you're not 30.  I haven't thought of a 17 year old GIRL as datable since I was around 22.
2S2onP86aa	I get that a lot, too. <br>  It's whether you figure out a solution and fix what's making you feel this way.<br>  Unless you want to completely forget about it, then try to go shopping, have a nice dinner with your best friends, watch a comedy movie to cheer you up, nothing dramatic or whatsoever. Eat ice cream and chocolate. Um, take a nap for an hour or two. Have a nice hot bubble bath? Shop online? It's fun, too. Go grocery shopping but for candy?<br>  Take a walk? <br>  <br>  I hope I helped.|`|IPS3hWweaa	I like to watch movies, maybe something funny, especially with a close friend who likes to laugh a lot. That always helps.|`|UNFxjNHkaa	i love art - so i usually paint a picture<br>  <br>  or<br>  <br>  play with my cats<br>  <br>  or just simply go for a walk!

08y8R0Zxaa	I think he is really trying to tell you he's interested especially by the clothing situation. He probably ran out of ideas so why not? The smiles suggest he likes you so jump for it, even though the clothing thing is a little weird. HAHA GOOD LUCK!|`|XkPgw7ZRaa	Dear Hum.......<br>  <br>  I think he is trying to capture your attention.  You need to get moving before you lose his interest.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Anthony|`|9iXGakohaa	Most guys that I know wouldn't copy a girls clothing to show they like her. I think you're reading too much into the clothing thing, but that the other stuff seems to indicate he likes you.|`|hCJzZ5rnaa	Why is he wearing girls' clothes?|`|7HYJG7q9aa	ya i think ur reading too much into it becuase i dont think alot of guys would do that but if he is a guy that would do that then y it is something haha|`|xqEOb4BXaa	hi you can try this one:<br>  dating-tips4you.blogspot.com<br>  it really worked for me|`|NAMrOZRiaa	Just ask him, or try and spend more time with him, find out if you have things in commen.|`|Gb8cl8n2aa	don`t jump into conclusions like that..wait and see
AqXadhUzaa	I am like you, except Im only beginning to start my "change". In my opinion, if they are true friends they will stick with you. I only have a few friends too, but I like them because I get along well with them and have shared times in my life with them. I don't like them because one is confident, another one is good at sewing, and another one is well educated. Thats not how we choose our friends. They are not going to say to you "Erm, you'r confident and tough now, I can't be friends with that" - That would be just wierd. Your still you, just improved. They should love you more !
p1RdTbP2aa	Seriously the best revenge is being happy. Because if they see you again and your smiling and having fun they think what they have missed and maybe even regret it. Don't let the fact that he's won again get you down just try and face each day as it comes.<br>  hope I helped:)<br>  good luck:)<br>  ???????????????|`|CnHYgd7baa	go out with your friends and have a good time. i bet you could find a guy a million times better than him|`|viR8Sf01aa	Leave him as soon as possible. He doesn't deserve you. It may seem like you can't do it, you can't live without him, but you can. A guy who treats you like this isn't worth it. He really is a jerk. There are plenty of other guys out there, you just have to get out of this ridiculous relationship. Good luck leaving him.|`|80be183cc25c83d67c39e72c49dc6fc3aa	been there... i know its horrible. i have been dumped a lot of times... but guess what i learned. those guys are just useless jerks who use girls to bring up their ego. u rock! get that in ur head already! he's not worth it. u r! so just pick up ur self and walk ahead... u have one less burden off ur shoulders. it's not that easy... it'll take time. grief is a process that a third party can stop... only you have the power to wake up and be happy again. :) sometimes i wish all the guys who makes us girls sad will just vanish lol! (ignore that last sentence... just an evil thought lol! ) anyways just do what makes u happy... :) good luck with everything... remember... once a girl is sad... all the girls in the world is out there to look and take care of u. :)
0e7e2273a98e965ef6963c7287e9faffaa	I got my sister to do my hair for me but I went and had my make-up done professionally. To be honest I could have done a better job of it myself, i wouldn't waste your money if I were you.|`|AA11380378	My MOH helped my with my hair and my best friend did my make up (she's a make up artist). My make up was simple, you want to look like yourslef and not to go over the top or look too over done. I wore my hair down, I had a beach wedding so updos were not an option.<br>  <br>  Some people do need expert hands to help them with their hair and make up in order to look their best. I feel very confortable doing my own (I used to be a model) and learned alot from the pros, but some people may not have the experience and expertise.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|PqGCeIelaa	My wedding dresser was on maternity leave so I had someone else do it, just have a practice run done so you know what you want and what you don't want.<br>  I also had my make-up done. There isn't a differences in the make-up per say, there is a difference in how you should look. This should be the day that you should look absolutely beautiful inside and out. So pay the $40 to get your makeup done with good make-up that they have at the solon. Also find a picture(s) of a look that you are going for, how you want your eyes to look what colors you want to have. The more detail you give your make-up artist the better they can please you. <br>  Good Luck!|`|F8iYNurEaa	It varies from person to person. I am going to book a special bridal package with my regular hairdresser which includes a trial and the hair being done on the actual day. Most hairdressers will offer a service like this. Alternatively, you could practice on yourself or get a friend/family member to do your hair for you. <br>  <br>  As for make up, again you can get a bridal package (trial and actual day), you could do it yourself or get someone to do it for you. Alternatively, my friend went to a department store and booked an appt on the Estee Lauder counter. The EL woman then did a trial on my friend and showed her what colours would suit her (and be suitable) for a wedding and showed her how to apply it professionally. My friend bought some of the products that were demonstrated and her make up looked beautiful on the day. <br>  <br>  Bridal make up is generally natural looking rather than being overly heavy. Soft colours are better otherwise you will end up looking harsh. Soft browns, pinks, corals all look beautiful.|`|b1xQKDEraa	Im having my regualr hairdresser do my hair, as I feel more comfortable with her and she wont charge me the earth...in fact she is doing it for free! Some people get wedding hairdressers, I say if your hair dresser is available, get them to do it as you know the quality of their work etc. with regards to makeup it depends what you want, If you dont want much on then you can do it yourself or get a friend to do it. If you want a radical change then get a professional. Make up shops e.g. bobbi brown, mac, aveda etc will do free make up trials so you can get a feel for the type of make up you would want.|`|03n14OLLaa	Depends on the season, where you're getting married, the time your getting married, the dress you're wearing and if it's inside or outside. I'm getting a profesional to do both my hair and make up just so I don't want to mess it up. Good Luck!
Hapc1N9haa	My bf's lovely, he rubs my belly when it hurts, rubs my back or strokes my hair.  He's really sensitive when I do have my periods which is really great, he's just awesome, he knows how difficult it is for me!  Oh yeah and... he puts hot water in my water bottle!!!|`|3jqcLj7Saa	Leave her alone! She is going through something you will never understand and she just does not feel good. Nature is taking care of her ability to bring life into the world and she can't help whats happening. Support her, love her but keep you hand and everything else to yourself during this time of the month. Again as a guy you'll never know what is happening to her and don't ask just support, support and love, love, love.|`|r7GMWkPraa	i like it when my boyfriend punches me in the uterus.|`|bJf1yc3Laa	I'm a heavy flow type...so he donates blood for me.  Then we finger paint.|`|4USvZW6vaa	i think that a massage will be a good thing..|`|s8cZsSX0aa	lol this is an easy one. When my girl has her period, I simply say if you need anything holla at me, I'll be in the garage. <br>  <br>  Heres a tip for all you guys when its that time of the month. <br>  <br>  Should a woman ask "DO I LOOK FAT IN THESE?"<br>  the only answer is "Sweetheart, my love, my only reason for living, you look beautiful, and stunning in anything you wear."<br>  <br>  If she ask "Where do you think you are going?" <br>  The only answer is "Sweetheart, my love, my only reason for living, I was just going to go out and by you some flowers to show how much I love you."<br>  <br>  If she says "If I die would you remarry?"<br>  the only answer is: "Sweetheart, my love, my one and only reason for living, just the mention of living without you drives grief into killing me."<br>  <br>  Kinda see a pattern here, when its that time, tell her what she needs to hear and steer clear at all costs. If she wants you to do something for her she will ask. So all these guys who say I would draw her a tub filled with hot  water, scented with lavender, you have obviously not been with a female long enough.<br>  <br>  By the way:::::::This should be done everyday, regardless if its her time or not.<br>  Always tell her you love her when you leave the house or are ending a phone call with her.  Even if you are fighting.|`|frN73zikaa	Nothing, period time is not a special day. lol<br>  And beside you are still too young
7iEk06aDaa	Don't worry, your having normal feelings that are not uncommon with teens your age. You are coming on adulthood, and it's natural to feel the need to seperate yourself from your parents. We've all done it, we've all talked in one word sentences to our parents, and at 15, friends become overwhelmingly important to you. You can relate only to them, and talk only to them because you can be yourself. Everything your feeling is a normal part of reaching manhood and separating the child part of you from yourself.|`|0FXVTZf7aa	You're becoming a young man, maybe he's pushing you to stand-up for yourself.|`|AA11680669	As a parent of a teenager sounds pretty normal to me!<br>  <br>  It's about the generation gap, yepp do your really think adults take pleasure in listening to the hoo so vacious drivvel that come from teenagers as we have seen and heard it all before.<br>  <br>  And do I expect my teenager to listen to the boring vaicous drivvel I spout out becuase of course you know it all already.<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong it's not a dig at you it's just I would be more worried if you preferred spending time with old folks.<br>  <br>  Seldom talk to your dad? LOL show me a teenager who does.<br>  <br>  Once you've found yourself then you can start to tell him you really don't want to go to the Mall (unless your still to young to be left alone in the house)<br>  <br>  Chill out as long as your not suicidal your emotional state is pretty normal.|`|AA12041870	You must be a young teenager.  You are not alone in the way you feel.  Someday, your opinion will change.|`|LiqV0tGhaa	You need to start talking to your dad.<br>  <br>  You could start by asking his advice about how to punctuate a sentence; that stuff about Capital letters and full stops.  <br>  <br>  .

Tons of people on those.)<br>  Age 18.|`|CFFxtileaa	Yeah I would, <br>  I'd rather go out with a guy who has a nice personality than a guy who is gorgeous but not nice, personality comes first in my eyes and it sounds like your a nice guy, so thumbs up from me,<br>  <br>  From Kitty xx|`|skh0azhhaa	Aw, you sound really nice and attractive =] Sorry, I'm already taken but I'm sure a lot of people would find you attractive.|`|4GSdV8Fiaa	16!

The skater type is definitely hot and Hurley, Billabong etc. is great. <br>  <br>  It was cool how you wrote a bit about your personality as well as your looks.

Anyways, finally after months of fighting and fighting and bla, she actually fell in love with me. And pam pam, i dumped her few days after she told me so.

iPNOVR6Gaa	If it were me, I would probably take the opportunity to go to a movie in which my wife was not interested, but that I wanted to see.  I'm a huge movie fan.  Since you're a woman, maybe He's Just Not That Into You, or maybe Confessions of a Shopaholic, for example.|`|YENiEvoJaa	Hang out with your mom or other available person you haven' tconsidered. :) Or , go out by yourself somewhere where you can watch a band play so you don't feel bored/alone/awkward or hey even see a movie! You don't need company at a theater you're not goign to talk to them anyway lol|`|SovaFpN8aa	If I were in your shoes, I would head to a bookstore. Go to Borders or a similar type store that has a coffee bar. Enjoy some coffee, scan through lots of different books.

Or lock yourself in the bedroom and rent some movies.  Rent the chick flicks we love and that our husbands really hate watching with us.  You know, the ones that you know is going to make you cry, so that's why you watch it!  Take your tissues and snacks to the bedroom with you and forget they are even there!  Enjoy your alone time.  While you are at it, take a long hot bubble bath that you probably never get the quiet time to take.  Shave your legs, do your nails.  Seriously, I would take advantage of it.  You know where your husband is.  You know he is safe.  You know your daughter is safe.  Enjoy some alone time.  They won't even know you are there.  In fact, hit the bedroom before they get there and only you and hubby will know.  Have fun.|`|aEpPt9koaa	All of your friends are sick? You don't have at least one friend to hang out with tonight? What about parents or relatives? Can you spend some time with them tonight? Or if your like me, go somewhere by yourself. I go to the movies by myself sometimes just to relax, get away, and have some me time. You could do the same. If none of those options work why don't you just stay in your room when the guys come over? That way they won't even notice you are home.|`|zFb022Iiaa	Guess that means it's you time.  Early evening manicure/pedicure, the book store.  Maybe before that you should stop and see someone that you haven't in a long time, or take soup to one of your sickies : ) Does the heart good.
dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Never marry someone just for money, or because you are being pressured to do so.  Marriage is a huge committment, and if your friend marries some rich guy just so she can take care of her mom, she is going to find the rest of her life to be one big resentment. <br>  <br>  Her mom wants her to have a good life.  A good life cannot be bought.  A good life will mean she has to do things that are fulfilling and make her happy, not feel burdened to marry someone she doesn't love.|`|c5UAa65qaa	Your friend's mom might not know about the affair, but she of all people should still be aware that a marriage can't be happy if one of the participants' hearts isn't in it.  That's true no matter how much money is involved.  If the rich guy's money isn't enough to earn her affection, then he can't give her everything she wants.  She should gently turn him down and look for more satisfying ways to support herself and her mother.|`|aEpPt9koaa	If you don't love someone let alone like someone then under no circumstances should you marry them. I don't care how rich the guy is. She shouldn't do because she will never be happy. Sure she might be able to go shopping everyday but she won't be truly happy.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Do not marry for money, you will always be unhappy.  Money doesn't buy happiness.|`|yOHCXiaMaa	Who is she living her life for?  She is not a slave where she has no choice as to what she does with her life.<br>  <br>  Your friends Mom, is not as stupid as your friend thinks.  She probably just thinks she has no choice as she is getting older and is afraid she can't find someone else.. or she would rather share than let go of the man she loves. <br>  <br>  Never base your happiness on someone else.   She won't change her feelings for this guy and it would be wrong in God's eyes to marry someone you have no intention of fulfilling his word with.  She would be miserable and it would damage your friend mentally.  A loveless marriage is about as comfortable as a pair of shoes 3 times smaller than your feet.<br>  <br>  My parents wanted my sister to marry a guy like that so she could have stability, money and live good.  My sister  told them since they wanted it so bad maybe they should adopt him as one of their kids and then they would never have to worry about old age.<br>  <br>  As far as the Mom, maybe your friend needs to get pictures and proof of this second family and sit her down so she can face the truth.  But be prepared... she may get mad cause she popped her fantasy or she may fall apart.  Either way she is better off without having to pay some other bimbo's bills.  I wonder if the other woman knows about this family?  HMMMMM makes you wonder.
veeC7Rvvaa	This is going to sound harsh, but I think the old record of ''i'm apathetic blah bla bla'' is getting old and boring now and it's time to shush about it. <br>  You keep repeating how you can't express your feelings but you manage to write a long essay of how you want him back? <br>  You probably enjoy the i'm emotionaly scarred playrole because it makes you feel more emo/goth and special and unique..<br>  <br>  This guy values your friendship and has said it in 10 different ways that he doesn't feel the same and that he doubts he'll ever do, so leave it that way and maybe it's a lesson for you to open up ..<br>  We realise what we had once we've lost it, so I wonder if your feelings towards him are genuine or simply to prove something to yourself and others (e.g, the other girl).<br>  Just because the other girl(s) are annoying, doesn't mean that they are because they express their feelings or not, it's irrelevant.<br>  <br>  Thing is, go figure out yourself and stop trying to get his attention by playing the opposite of most girls.. it's just a way to get his attention.<br>  <br>  About the dream, you both sound like teenagers, and teenagers have wet dreams all the time.. so it's nothing important.|`|Xmp4261Xaa	i was having trouble fallind asleep, but thanks to this, im just about to close my eyes. i only read your first 2 sentences, and decided i was going to get a headache. i rather watch SHAMWOW commercials than answer this immature question.
iP863XM6aa	Well, unless you guys get serious, i think her fun and friends will remain first. One thing you learn about guys: they come and go. If she were to put you infront of her friends, then shes taking a chance at losing friends when she's still not sure if your a keeper or not.<br>  It doesnt mean you cant trust her though.. if she starts feeling more connected to you, then she'll probably start wanting to hang out with you more often. If she still wants to go out and have fun, then join her.<br>  <br>  Just because she's 19 doesnt mean you cant trust her. Maybe she's wondering if she can trust you...|`|9EkFrApiaa	i would not trust her....she is young and wants to have fun.  good for her!|`|a984cQjKaa	it's not that she's untrustworthy, it's that she's still a child.  let her have her fun and find someone who's looking for the same thing you are.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	Why would you expect her to put you first?  Are you married?  Of course 19 year olds like to have fun, who doesnt?|`|KqWivPpAaa	dude, she's 19 years old. she's gonna want to have fun, maybe you need to be a little more open minded. dont be one of those guys...|`|wSKLLtryaa	Uh, yeah. She's still a teenager!|`|BwGOjB1Raa	Dude, I'm 20 and i do that to my girlfriend.  I'd hate to use a generic answer, but she's still young.  Of course she's gonna want to go out.  It doesn't mean she's not trustworthy.  She's just living the life of the average outgoing person.|`|4uOc515Laa	yes... dude shes stil 19(teenager) we only care about friends and fun...<br>  ok not like that!dont even think about that..|`|OV0P8N7kaa	Are you serious? When I was 19 I was dating a guy about 24 y/o all I was thinking about was hanging with my friends, taking every thing could from my guy. 19 y/o are not very mature ok! So dont execpt too much.|`|QQv8f1vRaa	maybe the fact that she likes u is part of her jus wantin to have fun and experience new things|`|81jCGbj8aa	chicks before dicks. thats the way it is for girls. completely normal.|`|PzZcR5keaa	i do that to my bf...my friends where there before him and thats the way it is goin to stay...sorry buddy...|`|4GSdV8Fiaa	do you realize the girl can't even drink?!|`|AXgEyWTpaa	duhhhh she a partyierrrr|`|fy6HuAc2aa	yea, thats normal. But, shes still wanting to have fun and be a teenager. she doesnt want commitment right now.
xzwZ3lt3aa	I'm not positive, about Ontario, but here in BC my girlfriend did that too. She was supposed to send the marriage certificate in after the wedding. Unfortunately alot was going on at the time, and she didn't find the certificate until 8 months later when they were moving. Her marriage is not valid. The marriage here must be registered within 6 months. No exceptions.|`|8b006ad2547d67b6ee6de41af44054b9aa	Something is wrong ! How come they don't have that marriage certificate ? It should have been issued by either the civilian authorities or by religious authorities, whichever performed the ceremony. If the marriage was never registered by religious authorities, they are not even legally married.
JOtgNWrLaa	oh my gosh i can totally understand. there are two girls in my friendship group who ive been friends for abt 4 years but i just want to drift away with. cos theres nothing worse than pretending to be someones friend when you arent.<br>  <br>  what i do is, i just talk to them less. MUCH less. its almost at just hello and goodbye. and me and the other two girls in my group kinda go off as a 3 and leave them as a 2. and we often hang around with differnt people. its harsh..i know! but i think these little things will make it much easier to drift away than actually 'dumping' your friend. that will be much harder - confrontation isnt easy! good luck|`|1cef39ebabe50607ed105c0fda68d316aa	just tell her you do not want to be friends any more, but tell her why, & tell her you will be nice & wave when you see her, do not be mean to your friend, remember every one has feelings,|`|FCCywzrAaa	hi am richard from ghana<br>   you know what i think. <br>  why dont you follow your <br>  heart. do what you think will <br>  make you happy not what <br>  other people think. it's  good <br>  to share your problem with others <br>  but they sometimes leads you <br>  astray . FOLLOW YOUR HEART.

Stop beating around the bush it'll just make it worse when its time to finally come out and say the friendship is over with.|`|oPY3I1hOaa	just tell her how annoying she is and that you dont want her to be you r friend anymore. and make it loud and clear so she could understand your message.|`|maQWDeutaa	just tell her how you feel thats what i do.|`|ymWkGqm7aa	She's using you! So just ignore her and go out with your friends.|`|SoLSd9Lyaa	I dumped a friend before, I told her "You know what, you're such a backstabber...back off" I told her all those stuff. I know it hurts but I was really mad at her..so we ended up mad at each other. Now, each time I see her, we just ignore each other and that is bad. I think you should just pretend to be cool and patient. I'm not saying be plastic, but it's the best way, just let the friendship pass away without hurting each other.|`|OKFE62fWaa	Easy, if you have the courage to do it just tell her "I don't want to be friends with you anymore", incase she asks "why?," just say "because I just don't like u anymore", incase you don't have the courage then tell her through a phone :P|`|zGySmCgjaa	i don't think you should dump her...yet...maybe you should talk to her about how your feeling at first and see if that makes a diff..but if it doesn't, just say "ai don't think we can be friends anymore"..|`|6hIUaIkEaa	dont dump her....instead just tell her what u feel... either she'll understand that she's actually annoying you n will not trouble u the way she used to do...or....ummmmmm....if she's smart enough...then she'll understand that its BBYE tym....!|`|PpYl2dFVaa	call her and tell her to get on yahoo and read your question that will work
1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You can be supportive and helpful.  You can guide her in the right directions.  But after your bits of wisdom know when to leave her alone and let her handle her sorrow herself.  If you love her leave her alone about sex.  It will come again once she seeks help in her own style on her own terms.  Since you don't seem to know it now is not an appropriate time to be trying to concieve a child.  It sounds as if your concern is geared mostly to your lack of sex.|`|0wdEcNk1aa	It is not that she doesn't care how beautiful you think she is. It is that she cannot see herself that way right now and can't believe that you see her that way either. She is a mother, a student, a wife and under huge amounts of social pressure (just count all the diet commercials on tv to get my point). <br>  <br>  Help her stick to the healthy eating plan. Keep helping in the house but make sure both of you take at least half an hour a day to get some exercise. That can be as simple as a family walk every evening (if you have to let the dishes go, oh well). The fresh air and exercise will do wonders for her stress level, her feeling of well being and her sex drive. If you both stick to this, she will maintain a healthy weight throughout any subsequent pregnancies.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	Having weight problems can get us women depressed, if we do not feel good about ourselves, then there is no way that a woman can believe that you think we are beautiful.  It is that negative self talk we do to ourselves, and yes it is destructive.  I will tell you what helps me, keep from getting so depressed when I have those feelings of being unattractive, is getting out and exercising, it can be a simple walk with the family, or the two of you sharing a walk alone together.  Exercise stimulates not only your metabolism, but the serotonin in your brain, which controls depression.  I began exercising a few weeks ago, and honestly I feel great, I have a positive attitude, not that I don't get to feeling a little blue from time to time, but overall I feel much better, because I know that I am doing something for myself.  Now if you get her a membership somewhere.....UMMM, make sure that the 2 of you are involved with it, because if you just get her a membership, then she may say to you or to herself....."he thinks I am fat too", and then she will get upset.  If she is pregnant, then that is going to cause a great deal of mood swings.....but she can still exercise, and walk to keep her body healthy, she needs to get a home pregnancy test and see if she is, b4 starting at a gym or the Y.....But the Y is a great place because it has stuff for kids there, it is family oriented.|`|Uxe1GjP0aa	Does she really want to be pregnant again, would be my question.<br>  But if she does, what she needs to do is talk to her doctor about avoiding gaining too much weight due to her pregnancy. It can be easily taken care of, carefully.<br>  There are exercise routines for pregnant women. It's not a disability to carry a baby.|`|tCI8ksvdaa	There are many causes for depression.  Far too many for any suggestion of diagnosis here.  How long has it been since she gave birth?  This could be a cause.  <br>  I recommend you stop trying to conceive for now.  This is a stress she does not need if she is depressed.  Recommend she see a doctor about the depression (psychiatrist).  Be supportive and be patient.|`|AA11180444	You are doing just about all you can.  She may have hit a plateau with the diet and you can jump start that easily enough.  One hint to dieting is to not eat red meat twice in a row, whether it be twice in one day or once one day and once the next.  Eat more chicken and fish.  <br>  <br>  As far as gaining weight while she is pregnant.  If she eats healthy, there is a chance that she can gain minimal weight and after she has the baby, actually be smaller than when she got pregnant.  I only gained 13 pounds with each baby, and was smaller after having kids.<br>  <br>  You need to do more laughing.  It will relax her more.  Do fun things with her, like picnics on the living floor, or play some music and ask her to dance.  Think of things that the two of you used to do that was always fun and made you both smile.  Rent some comedies, or even some stand ups....they can be funny as heck!  <br>  <br>  Here's another option, come right and ask her if there is something that is blatantly bothering her.  And ask her if you can help her in any way or think of ideas on your own.  <br>  <br>  Maybe she needs to think about this.  Why have a baby when you are depressed?  Is that suppose to "fix" things?  It only gets more stressful and depressing once the baby comes.  You need to tell her that for the sake of the new baby, she needs to be happy and healthy (not depressed) before she gets pregnant.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|XfuHpwfjaa	Sit her down and talk with her in detail about what you feel are the problems that she is encountering from your perspective.  Go through each one as you bring it up and help her find a solution to each individual problem.  Make sure that you help and reminder her with the solutions.|`|RLoilwCNaa	It sounds like she is every woman in the world. Maybe get a YMCA membership so that she can go to an excersise class once or twice a week. People always feel better after they excersie. Maybe invest in a treadmill or stationary bike.|`|AHhaLVQ8aa	tell her that you want to help but you don't know how can she please give you some ideas how to make it better,by the way don't get discouraged now your doing fine just don't give up keep trying|`|2NUJsWIoaa	its her hormones. Just don't stop doing what you are already doing! She will get better soon!!<br>  <br>  By the way , you sound perfect!! ...Are you?!!!|`|4IekQKFAaa	hey:<br>  I am a wife and have the same problem,but I have joined a gym and I'm taking baby steps.If u tell her she looks beautiful no matter what,it will feel untrue,coz we women knows that no matter whats guys say they really love a sexy woman.So I console myself by asking my hubby what we would do when I turn thin and amazingly he answers me.<br>  <br>  So support her quest for fitness and get her some medication for depression.<br>  <br>  If she is pregnant,only a test can prove it!<br>  Goodluck|`|e4596390515e8d11a71ef13fed732cc9aa	Been there, done that!!!!  You may think she's beautiful thin of heavy but she may be embarrased of her size, belly, etc. that she doenst want you to see it.  If you two are trying to conceive again why is she dieting.  She might gain weight but once she is pregnant and has the baby and if you two plan to have no more children, she has a long time to shed the extra pounds.  Just continue to support her.  Ask her how she's doing daily and just listen.  Dont comment or try to understand (no offense but you wont) and let it be at that...  She may feel very guilty for you doing all the things around the house and she cant do it.  Deep down she may want to but cant.  Depression is a terrible thing.  It cannot go away by itself.  If she wasnt trying to have a baby again or as soon as she's finsihed having babies, she needs to visit a dr. about it.  Suggest to her to go see a dr and go with her for support.  If she is totally against it tell her you are there for her and when she's ready for help you will be ready to take her.
ioJvfVgdaa	well i think he loves you and you should give it a try... but if you just prefer being best friends with him just say that it would ruin our friendship... and i think he is a bit weird for getting in the shower with you.. how old are you by the way and how old is he?? dont let your friends tell you who you should be with because its up 2 you......<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|dHcP602caa	He probably likes you...<br>  If you don't feel the same way, you need to tell him how you feel, be honest with him. If you do feel the same way, well then, great!  <br>  <br>  But that is a little weird that he got in the shower with you...kind of creepy, if you ask me.|`|f0f91b1f61307e94f9c53fd86e2c1295aa	i agree with willbewill, you led him on and he responded. This is largely your fault. You should say your sorry for leading him on and also ask him to apologize for the shower thing, and you explain that you like him, but only as a friend and you'd like it if things stayed that way.|`|owxYkIySaa	NO! That's not crazy. That's cute. Its okay if you were scared and nervous about the shower part, that was wrong of him. But at least you know that he likes you!|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	Sounds like your friend has feeling for you.  You need to tell he that you don't have the same feelings so, he doesn't get the wrong message.  Be honest and upfront with him.|`|4mdUJ9LHaa	Well, he OBVIOUSLY likes you. But the things he's doing is just perverted. You need to tell him that he cannot come into your shower! You are opposite genders, and you deserve your privacy. If you like him then go for it. But if you don't LIKE like him, THEN CONFRONT HIM (whoops left the caps lock key on), and let him know, he just is not the guy for you, but that you really value his friendship. Let him down gently. Best of luck, -Brook
WyCmQBuvaa	Tell them that it is a golden puppy and will lay golden eggs.  It takes a little while until the egg laying organs mature.   Etc.<br>  <br>  It is your parents' house.  Respect their wishes.  When you are all grown up you can get a whole kennel of dogs.  You can be the one to buy the food, you can be the one to get the shots, you can be the one to get him neutered, you can be the one who's furniture he chews up, you can be the one who's neighbors complain about barking, you can be the one to sue when he bites someone.<br>  <br>  Are you going to get up early to walk him?  Are you going to pick up his poop?  Are you going to groom him?  Who is going to watch him when you are at school?  What is going to do?  Sit around?  That is not fair.  <br>  <br>  Tell you what, make you a bet.  I bet that you can't take care of an egg for 2 weeks.  It would be cracked or abandoned the first day.|`|7iEk06aDaa	Dogs bringing in diseases? LOL, that's a new one on me. It sounds like they are pretty much set in their answer and until you move out, there will be no dogs for you. I never trusted people that don't like animals. Even though I feel bad for you, I don't see any way around their decision.|`|SRpcbiuaaa	im so sick of dogs, sure they're cute  when they're pups, but they grow  up  to be big  stupid ugly dogs that dont shut up. get a cat instead so you  can post random stupid vids of your cat being curious ....well most of this of  this is how i feel about my dogs anyway<br>  but as for you, maybe show them one your friends pups or get better  grades|`|RYZ8CVZTaa	you could do little research on caring for dogs and convince them that u have responsibility.|`|jVUEohsNaa	I want to get another woman, but my wife won't let me.<br>  <br>  I guess we can't have everything we want.|`|SvdFzKs4aa	if they dont want you to have a puppy you dont get a puppy sorry|`|UiUX4tPtaa	puppy is not a toy, so do not experiment and bring him home without approval. try once again to talk with parents to see you as determinate and responsible person that will take all obligation for the dog. they do not bring disease, only love and many many funny moments and joy in life.|`|4ujEpNLsaa	Start with a hamster or something then maybe eventually they will let you get a dog.|`|1939q5Tgaa	get over it.
7iEk06aDaa	I think that your decision to cut off all ties with your parents is the correct one. There comes a time when enough is enough. No one needs to except being verbally abused by ANYONE. Her accusations that her beatings were somehow the result of your being there as a child are ludicrous. Your parents made the choice of staying in an abusive relationship, and you had nothing to do with it. To tell you that it was your fault is selfish and untrue. She is co-dependent on your dad, and it would be healthier for you to just step back and live your own life. Good luck.|`|mvgszvXoaa	I am sorry your mother said that to you!  I am more then aware of how it feels to be slammed by your mother & its something that I honestly dont understand how anyone would treat even a stranger the way I get treated, let alone your daughter.  <br>  <br>  My situation is slightly different (my mother is an alcoholic) but the verbal abuse has been present my entire life.  My father was extremely mean to me when I was younger & then the older I got my mother started using me as her punching bag.  A lot of the abuse was done when she was drunk but now that she's sober the abuse is still there!  <br>  <br>  How I deal w/ it is I REPEATEDLY have to remind myself that the only thing I can control is my actions.  Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I have it in me to be just as nasty of a person as she can be but I don‚Äôt want to be that so I have to constantly work at controlling my anger & when she lashes out I just let it roll off my back.  It still hurts & still causes a lot of distress w/in me but at the end of the day I know I treated her the way I wanted to be treated and that‚Äôs all you can do in these situations.  <br>  <br>  I don‚Äôt think you need to cut ties w/ your mother plus I think that would cause the same amount of distress for you as having her in your life but I do think you need to distance yourself from her.  It comes down to being more selective w/ her just like picking friends & knowing which friends you can trust more then other ones.  Its sad that it has to be that way w/ a mother but sometimes that‚Äôs how the cards play out.  Eventually (hopefully) she‚Äôs get the clue why you don‚Äôt involve her in your life the way you use to & maybe she‚Äôll catch on to being a better person towards you by the examples you lead her to w/in your own actions.  <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!
R0U4qy6haa	if you love someone there are always things to talk about -and i find my girl very exciting to me every day that i am with her-it has never gotten boring-we have been together for three years now and we do everything together-we do not need a boys night out or a girls night out we have each other to make us happy and smile
Vp83Fuakaa	Maybe he like to keep the relationship with his students professional .his facebook acccount might be for freinds and family that live far away and have personal things not ment for a school setting|`|ymWkGqm7aa	lol why would he want to accept? So little kids can find out about his private life? Don't think so!|`|0U2f9dwLaa	A lot of schools have policies about what is appropriate for a teacher/student relationship.  He may feel communication outside school is inappropriate and be waiting until he is officially no longer your teacher to add you.  I really don't think he is hiding anything.  A teacher shouldn't have anything he has to hide on facebook so I doubt that is it unless he i just a very private person.|`|f9yORGumaa	Teachers are strange, but it probably has something to do with business ethics (as someone else also stated).<br>  <br>  I have a strange teacher as well. She told our college class (that starts at 8 in the morning) that we CHOSE an early class and she doesn't want to see any yawning going on!<br>  <br>  I told her, "I can't guarantee that I won't yawn in class because yawning is an involuntary action my body takes when I don't receive enough oxygen."<br>  <br>  She didn't have anything else to say about that. hehe.|`|fAI3E5qeaa	you're not allowed to have relationships with your students outside of school by law. your teacher could be charged with not nice allegations. like pedafile etcc.|`|jcX7g2Mcaa	he is probably trying to get you to look forward to the exam and do well in it|`|Rn5Xcs7paa	i think it might be against some kind of rules to add kids on facebook because he seems as if it would be okay after he moves to another job, so maybe he's just trying to do the most responsible thing...|`|eSKPkbayaa	He most probably wants you guys to lay off the facebook and STUDY.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	its all about ethics
ytGaDM7Haa	hard to say. I don't know about most girls but I'm kind of shy and conservative/modest so if I liked a guy I wouldn't be able to maintain eye contact with him for very long. I'd most likely look down or away pretty quickly but keep looking back and forth (hence the fluttering eyelashes). Unless I was absolutely sure that I liked him and he liked me then I would maintain eye contact to kind of signal that I'm yours. Otherwise, to stare back is usually a negative, like "I know you're looking at me, wtf do you want?", or maybe not quite as mean. But basically it's to make the other person uncomfortable, exert power - force them to look away first.<br>  I could be totally wrong though.|`|3BMBZtDxaa	If I make eye contact with a guy and keep it, and it's not like a dirty stare or something, then it usually means that I want them to come up and talk to me. <br>  <br>  I usually find the guy cute or want to get to know him better so I keep the eye contact hoping he'll come up to me or notice.|`|98cJg2pCaa	Either she likes you or completely hates you.<br>  <br>  Depends what kind of eye contact it is.|`|ZYyzCeoeaa	No way, for some reason i do this with some dude, and if i'm honest i don't even like him. It just happens i guess. Unless she goes out her way to stare at you all the time when she sees you then i'd be like maybe she likes you. <br>  <br>  Now it's just one of those uncertain things that only talking to her can you solve the mystery.|`|Rs5QTZ85aa	Oh, there is definitely something there ;)<br>  <br>  Although, when I'm maintaining steady eye contact, I'm usually glaring at the person...but don't mind me!<br>  <br>  I think you should try talk to her, sounds like she might like you, either that or she's too stubborn to break eye contact.|`|veeC7Rvvaa	Means she fancies you. Say Hi and give her a little smile!<br>  <br>  Sometimes, eye contact happens accidentally but not like 5 or 6 times on a row like whats happening in your case, so I think she's interested!|`|SsAxq5z9aa	It means she wants to sleep with you.<br>  <br>  Is that what you wanted to hear?|`|AA10720869	Ohh, i love these types of eye contacts. I do it to this guy in my Biology class to let him know I'm interested in talking to him. It took a while for it to happen, but he eventually came up to have casual talk and now we're good friends. How about you talk to her? Eye connection is really important! I think steady eye contact just means the urge to say something, without actually saying it.|`|nISWmpq2aa	look, i think u really like that girl and if u didn,t then u must not have been thinking of her and asking questions?? But anyway, my advice would be give this some more time. U try to ignore her once and notice her gestures, if u feel like that she missed u , then go 4 it, she's urs. But if she even ignores u the second time, then it would be very clear that she noticed u ignoring her and felt bad and so she is doing the same, this will prove it on the spot.<br>  Best of luck<br>  Reva|`|jJ9JGCNTaa	I usually do it when i guy is so f****n cute i just can't stand it, so you must be.Or when a guy won't stop stareing at me i just look at him,were you already stareing at her? it could be either way. good luck|`|am7Ykwqiaa	If she smiles whilst maintaining eye contact, she likes you. Maybe she is shy, go talk to her.|`|WuxsTx1taa	it means she likes you,<br>  flirt see what happens<br>  <br>  :)|`|ff821ce78a4a75250794e181494a8cf9aa	It means she thinks you're hot! I make eye contact with guys I find good looking, so I assume that's what THIS girl thinks too!|`|1keW9Dofaa	If I keep eye contact with a guy, it's because I want him to talk to me!|`|Xdz5I3wWaa	I think the reason he had that eye contact with you is because she likes you. Let posit a question : Does that girl know you and likewise you know her? If yes, maybe she has feelings for you and convey it through eye contact; or you did something against to her or said something about her; or one possible reason is that you are familiar to her that is why she stares at you that way.|`|rV8mHGO3aa	Its her yelling at you saying "TALK TO ME"<br>  She's allowing you to be the one who takes the reins and make the first move!<br>  So, next time smile, take a deep breath and say <br>  -Hey I'm Frank! (substitute name for your own, you dont want her to think you're a untrustworthy...puahha) <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|TWQD3Kexaa	Yes i do for guys i think, but it depends what country there in some people do it differently if they are in a different country, where do you come from?|`|dEAXvTXoaa	could mean she likes you, but i like to make eye contact as i walk past guys i dont know because it makes me feel quite powerful hahaha|`|p1eAG1qJaa	maybe she is interested in you:)..or wants you to see her too..:)..or is checking if you have an eye contact with her back:)
hkwBR1moaa	Absolutely not.  I would be excited for her.  I picked her as a bridesmaid because I loved her and wanted to share my day with her.  Not because I wanted my pictures to come out great with skinny gorgeous people.  Although all my bridesmaids are gorgeous in their own way!|`|RA3p25Qoaa	I wouldn't be mad or upset or anything, I would be a bit surprised because all my Bridesmaids are single. But if their pregnancy happened under terms they were happy with I was be happy and excited for them. I wouldn't take away bridesmaid status. If dresses need to be altered so be it. If they can't make the wedding because of complications or their due date they would be missed and I would make sure the MC announced that they were unable to attend and send warm wishes to them.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	It would definitely depend on what dress I picked and how far along they were.  I mean some dresses are fine--a nice chiffon empire waist dress, but some dresses (like the one I picked for my bridesmaids) are rather corset like and there is no way it could be let out enough to be comfortable.  I'd feel terrible even asking someone more than 7 months to stand up to begin with so if they were going to be close to due date, I'd understand that they couldn't.<br>  <br>  But if we are talking 1-5 months and it merely looks like they gained 5 lbs, aren't even showing, no one is even going to know.  Of course I'd still want them up there.<br>  <br>  But I would also be very understanding--a lot of people can't afford the costs once they start thinking about the budgeting concerns of having a newborn.<br>  <br>  I'd only ask someone not to be a bridesmaid if they were 8-9 months along.  Women at that level of hormones would feel terrible about letting ME down so they'd try to force themselves to and I don't want anyone to be miserable standing for 2 hours or concerned that their due date is my wedding date.|`|jK9H6PHiaa	I also was in this situation. My friend after asking her to a bridesmaid held it from me until she was 4 months. Including she was due on my wedding day!!! I was ok with it figured shed have the baby early but she also said she wouldn't walk down the aisle and stand shed HAVE to sit. She also couldn't buy the dress (I was buying everything else) so she backed out on me.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Why the hell would I be mad?!<br>  That is such a blessing!<br>  I dont care, she can just buy a maternity dress that's the same colour|`|caa265fc73cd7f24fe83d9a186ac1af9aa	I wouldn't be upset.  Nobody can put their life (or reproduction) on hold because they are in my wedding.<br>  <br>  I would just hope that if the timing of the birth were really close to the wedding that they would opt to take care of themselves & just be a guest if they could make it rather than stress about being a bridesmaid.  And thats not to say I wouldn't want them to be a BM, I wouldn't care if they were 6 or 7 months prego and still a BM - - but if the timing was super-close they may not be feeling well enough to attend, to travel to be at my wedding, or to stand during the entire ceremony as a BM.|`|AA11380378	Yes, no, yes, no, yes no.<br>  <br>  Unless you have been in that situation, it's hard to judge. When I got married, my BM SIL announced her pregnancy 3 weeks before the wedding. She could have waited 3 weeks, you know? I was very happy for them, but out of the sudden, it was all about the first grandchild tec. etc. etc. I won't lie to you and say that it did not bother me some, but I handled it well. I wished them the best and carrried on. It was my day to shine and I did : )<br>  <br>  I would have only asked a BM out if they would be very pregnant by then. It is just best if not. Being aBM carries a responsability and if they unable to carry on is best to decline the honor.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|2o3BHgCCaa	Only if we had already bought the dresses. I would hate to ask her to buy another just to fit her growing belly.<br>  Or if she was due the week of the wedding, I don't want to worry about her giving birth on the altar.<br>  I wouldn't be angry, just upset that plans were made more stressful because of this.|`|sGP6s7uraa	This happened to me.  I was disappointed but she assured me it would be ok (my wedding is in May and she is due in June).  I was skeptical but I thought it would be ok.  Wrong.  I called her 2 days before we bought the BM dresses and she backed out.  I had NO TIME to find another BM to replace her.  I was pissed off then; pissed at the situation she left me in AND the fact that she waited until the last minute to tell me she couldn't be there (something about travel restrictions for her).<br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong.  I am truly happy for her and her husband but she didn't need to wait that long, ya know?<br>  <br>  EDIT - No, they can get knocked up all they want just don't back out at the last moment.  I was all for her being in the wedding with her big ole' pregger belly.  I was really excited because she was going to stand beside me during my day.  Plans change, though.  I'm still a bit bitter but I'm getting over it.|`|afI03mJXaa	No. Why would you be upset for? If it was in the early stages then the dress should not be affected, but if it was in the further stages I would ask her if she still wanted to be in the wedding due to the pregnancy and discomfort, but be mad no. I would also congratulate her.|`|Slr6jtMGaa	No.....it wouldn't be any of my business.....unless it was with my fiance....which would never happen.......the only thing that would bother me is the dress size.....but that's not bad....i know many people who had bridesmaids/ maid of honors who were pregnant.....if you care for them and really want them in your wedding....then you should let it go......My sister is pregnant and i'm letting her be my maid of honor....|`|6UmRmaeWaa	Nope the chicks at the dress store can pick out a nice dress she could fit in based on how far along she will be. It will work out just fine I would not be upset at all. If you are having them wear matching dresses then her fault she's going to have to fit in that bad boy ;)|`|HvbIE03saa	Why the hell would it matter? Seriously, unless you want to be labeled a Bridezilla Diva, just congratulate her and make sure she has a good seamstress to alter her dress.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	No-  Brides can ask a lot of their bridesmaids/maid of honor, but that can't ask them to put their lives on hold until the wedding.  She will probably have to order the dress in a larger size and have a seamstress alter it a week or two before the wedding.  Unless her due date is near the wedding or she will have to travel to your wedding, she should be able to participate.  This is an exciting time in her life too... so congratulate her, offer your support and tell her to let you know if she feels like her responsibilities in your wedding become too much.|`|50mZOWw3aa	absolutly not....in fact im in that situation right now.....i'm getting married in august and shes due in july.....i mean she wont have a lot of time to get her dress fitted but it will work out.  this is what i did when i found out she was pregnant.. i tokk her in the early stages to get her dress and had her get it 2 sizes bigger just incase she couldn't loose all the "baby fat" right away...then we got her due date which as i said is in july and she'll have about 2 weeks to get her dress fitted...i was like you at first, didn't know what to do, if she was gonna back out, the whole nine yards, but we worked it out...i hope that this will help you out, but if its your maid of honor, talk to her about it and see how you can work it out...<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|Iyc5vrEcaa	No. These people are your friends, you should be happy for them. It would suck if they couldn't be in the wedding anymore, but oh well, nothing can be done.|`|ECe1rgsdaa	No, why should their lives stop just because I am getting married?<br>  <br>  I actually did recently find out that one of my bridesmaids is pregnant and I am very happy for her! The baby will be my neice or nephew because it is my fsil who is pregnant! :)<br>  <br>  The only thing I am worried about is her comfort during the ceremony, as she will be 8 months pregnant, so I will have a chair nearby in case she needs it.
VRSUyeqbaa	it's mainly because you don't have them. <br>  and yes, i pay attention to others girls breasts, and i do make comments from time to time.|`|XJ0Nux6Naa	I dont pay attention to other girls boobs. but some girls compare boobs, we joke around.<br>  <br>  but its probably because youre growing, and youre getting sexual lol and boobs are a sexual part of a girls body. its pretty normal, though its disrespectful to girls. i mean, i had a guy staring at my boobs while he was asking how i was. i replied "yep, theyre okay, how are you?" and he blushed big time.|`|0a159327e13fba9624dbea2f61dd926eaa	i only pay attention to them when they are really very nice, they should be average sized to slightly smaller than average, very firm and supple, not too small/perky.  also the right shirt makes all the difference.  if she has great breasts and a nice face, i have a tough time hiding my interest in the girl when talking to her|`|4bedkpvLaa	its because they are the best and most beautiful part of the female body. I eman they are just really awsome beautiful and sexy.|`|FzFSzilmaa	cos they are on show for your amusement... :D also, it is "look, but don't touch"... so you want to touch...|`|j0G4Zz0Yaa	hell naa thats gay but i mean we do joke about them like all my friend s talk about how i dnt have big boobs and how my sister has enough boobs for the both of us<br>  <br>  but girls feel disrespected when guys say it...its just not good mannered|`|MQQTmQFBaa	Chest is the place which differentiates man from woman. I am not really fascinated by the presence but depends on how a woman carries them on... <br>  <br>  I just think they are part of woman body|`|8WYFLp1Baa	I don't understand why guys like them so much. They're just lumps of fat basically.<br>  <br>  I don't pay attention to other girls boobs. Some girls compare their boobs to other girls though, like 'oh my gosh, I wish I had her boobs' it's nothing sexual though, unless they're lesbians.
d2vENVGlaa	that's commonplace in australia, dickwad. how else would you show how much you appreciate your fellow fuckfaced friends?|`|WYPEG8l7aa	haha yeah|`|uAyYRXnvaa	It's very common in Australia.... of course it all depends on the tone and closeness of the people as to whether it's an endearment or insult.  I think people from other countries often get taken aback by it.|`|10456fcb36c09d510c3f73faba95f075aa	Yes, it's just playful banter. Of course they are not "proper", and I wouldn't say that they are terms of endearment, it's just a bit of fun. As long as those involved aren't offended by it, what does it matter?|`|t3G5xSbIaa	ya why not i call ma friends bitches cuz ima girl tey're hirls too its not offending when ya use it in da right way hun.|`|1QiPrFyfaa	yeah why not it's just a laugh.<br>  if i called you betty swollocks would you get offended?|`|pvd3V8ppaa	yes|`|s0GU6ULMaa	i guess guys are different. <br>  <br>  some girls do do that, except using other expletives and obscenities. <br>  <br>  i think its becoming more popular lately. i dont like to do that but. maybe im not normal but i- even though its a joke- dont appreciate it. and dont feel right calling my friends that unless we're fighting or w/e.|`|9K8Zksfwaa	if its two dudes, yes. girls would take that as a challenge to a fight.|`|K1rUaOqWaa	yep.|`|seqEdwwnaa	yes...they do say that kind of stuff all the time....its just showin ur love :)
AA10496297	Blusher veils and birdcage veils are not the same - see references below. Yes I believe you could do either - but for the dress I would suggest  a short (or blusher) veil for the ceremony at least - and maybe a small hairpiece or comb for the reception,|`|R7b150Iyaa	A blusher veil is the same as a bird cage veil.  That said, the model in the picture IS wearing a veil, she's holding it up with her right hand.  I think you can definitely still wear a veil with that hairstyle.  Because the bun would be on the side of your head and not in the back, the veil wouldn't cover it.  Just have the veil put in about the center of the back of your head, to the side of the bun, and it'll look beautiful.  Pretty dress, by the way.<br>  <br>  Good luck and congrats! =)|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	I love the bird cage veils, that would look the best with that hairstyle because it can be pinned to side also.  <br>  <br>  Do you want a longer veil to cover your face?  If so, I'd go with the blusher veil.  If not, you could just have a veil pinned on the back of your head and will still look great with hairstyle.|`|n3Agaj6naa	I think the hair and the dress complement each other beautifully!  I definitely like the accent that the model has in her hair, (which might be nice for you to wear during the reception), but I do think the hairstyle can work with a blusher veil.  Go try it out!|`|XRzSxgUnaa	most birdcage veils only come down past the eyes, blusher veils cover the whole face and extend below the chin. <br>  <br>  I think you could wear a veil, if you want to do it its your wedding! i think the bird cage veil would look better with the hairstyle personally|`|y2nC8BUGaa	Go with birdcage.  It wouldn't look as weird with the hair.|`|ifgzHzA3aa	The model in the picture has a veil on.  i think it looks fine.|`|hkwBR1moaa	If you look at the hairstyle picture, the bride is wearing a veil.  It looks to be a longer veil and it looks pretty.  I say go for it.  And not a blusher veil.|`|EjyD1sXeaa	you could always try one on with the dress and your hair in a bun before you buy it.<br>  personally, I think a veil completes the look and you have a beautiful dress.<br>  whatever you do have a lovely wedding and enjoy your marriage|`|5270639c059ab08c1b3431555f150db7aa	Gosh the dress the bun-woman is wearing is SO beautiful!<br>  Yes, you can have a veil, but I wouldn't go as long as hers in the pic. I suppose it would be attached to your crown at the back, but because of the style of your dress, don't get too fancy.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	A birdcage veil would look best with this hairstyle as a formal one would look odd.<br>  Lovely hairstyle by the way but personally I would do a fascinator like the model has in the pic.<br>  Good luck.|`|sGP6s7uraa	If you're deadset on doing a veil, I would do a blusher veil.<br>  <br>  I believe so.  I've always heard them referred to as "blushers".

AA11180444	If you interact with that person quite frequently you would know.  If the person is not so transparent than you gotta give them credit for at least being cordial and not letting it be known.  If this person is like that, then maybe you should at least return the same.  Someone who hates you, will not willingly accept you being nice to them.  Nor will they enjoy being ignored.  Take your attitude towards them in one of two directions and see what happens....be nice or just ignore them.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	You can only judge people by what they do. In fact it only really matters what they do. What they say or what you think they feel have no real bearing.<br>  BTW - We all judge others by what they do and we judge ourselves by our intentions.<br>  I'd simply proceed with caution.<br>  Good luck!|`|WDs4fRoxaa	Their actions are worth more than they could ever say.<br>  <br>  If they hate you, it would be obvious.<br>  <br>  Best wishes|`|WyCmQBuvaa	You don't.  You keep them at arm's length and always be polite.  You interact - sounds like a job.  <br>  <br>  What does it matter if they have good or bad feelings towards you?<br>  If you want to find out, ask them out for a beer after work.
iTLutsayaa	Since you have already told the insurance company the truth, it would seem suicidal, to now call them up with a lie. Your mother should wonder what kind of man she is married to that would encourage you to lie, and wonder what lies he has told her.<br>  Do not have doubt about yourself. You must resolve in yourself to be strong. Don't let that turd-head intimidate you. If he continues to give you a bad time, then call the insurance company up, talk to an agent. Tell him everything, and ask what you can do to get daddy wienie-smoker off your back.|`|a94f95d3f6f56d95bbd9f49f3ff665a4aa	honesty is the best policy|`|DcVoq5Tuaa	if they find out you lied, say good by to your insurance and hello to a jail cell.<br>  <br>  Play it Straight, stick with the truth.|`|KhC2zSvnaa	If you lie, they are going to see right through you because of the police report. The insurance will cover the damage because it was poor weather conditions that caused the accident. The insurance should not need anymore information from you.|`|wXyoo8mNaa	Stick to your guns,insurance fraud is a felony.|`|AA11377139	I eyed through your question. Being annoyed is human. Its worth to keep the truth alive to an extent but it should not let you go away from your step dad after all he is your dad.<br>  <br>  Be calm and try to make your dad understand that it was not your fault, though there were some damages caused. I hope this will help you.<br>  <br>  Sometimes little acceptance of blame saves big things which do come into notice in the later stage of life.<br>  <br>  Be happy my dear.<br>  <br>  Thanks|`|c1e3ef2ea6e3667009deb9df9340bd00aa	No I wouldn't lie, ask your stepdad, would he like for you to start lying to him. If you have told the truth then trust it, the only thing lying is going to do is, if they check the police report and all the other reports, get you into bigger trouble. Stay with the truth, lying is a crutch once you start you have to tell another to prop the first one up on.

6JAXZlG5aa	Maybe u should break up with your boyfriend because if your just friends with him than that's tech friends with benfits.Also having just sex with someone comes with conquences if you get feelings for the person if they tell people also have to worry about stds it's your choice but cheatin never works out karma! Just follow your heart and be careful always use protection|`|eNEgKxfJaa	Cheating is never the answer... if you feel like that then you shouldnt be in any kind of relationship... rather play around a bit. then no feelings get hurt. <br>  <br>  if you cant be with someone who is impotent then what are you doing in this relationship?? if you love him you wouldnt even consider doing something this low.|`|6aaCfPJiaa	go for it.|`|1b9b2144f2dfcbf2ab89c159c0722b98aa	Sex has never caused any problems.

71VRvldJaa	Yes!  I've been there, done that and I'd never do it again.  It wasted 3 yrs of my life!......3 yrs I'll never get back!|`|EVZtirRuaa	Depends!! On one hand "Distance make heart fonder" and on the other "Out of sight is out of mind". Both are true! But definitely, the latter one happens more and there's no escape from it. Distance always gives birth to lack of communication, unavailability of one of the partners in the right time and as a result doubts, emotional fluctuations, arguments - overall the journey becomes rough and rocky which eventually brings the dream relationship to an end. Also there are temptations and other priorities that seem to replace and occupy and as a result time becomes the biggest factor.<br>  So in order to survive in a long distance relationship both the partners must give 100% and by this I mean, 100% committment to stay in touch through regular mails and to make sure to talk over phone even for 5 mins a day no matter what happens. But, this is an idealistic situation. So, the best solution would be to just try to be friends again - atleast you wont lose your love in the end or allow insecurity (the greatest threat) to creep into your life. Just have fun and be happy that you guys have known each other in this lifetime and try not to expect anything. <br>  And Since, all these criteria seem a little too unrealistic in real life so, in the end, generally the relationship dies. I am seriously hoping that this won't be your case. Wish you all the best!!|`|jkapPqaCaa	it depends on how you and your bf/gf get a long, if you trust him/her then it might work. but if you'r worried that he/she might do something then it wont.

For the short time you're at work if your husband can't attend to your children then you have bigger problems than your work situation.  If you're trying to return full time show them commitment by going even though your children are ill.  Your husband and children will be fine without you.|`|JF0SIngqaa	If the children are sick I would not let them have the shots. If you feel that you should stay and help him then I would. It sounds like they all are ill and need to be seen by a doctor, I would do what I felt best for the children.|`|2c441ddbdb5c2e594351cb0212be0fe9aa	No you don't need to miss work. He can handle them for that short of a time. There's really no need for them to have to have both parents at home for the type of illnesses that you are describing.|`|XfuHpwfjaa	Are you telling me that you don't think you husband is capable of taking care of your children.  Go to work and bring home the bacon.<br>  <br>  My friend Mildred sent me.|`|w87jwOaOaa	Go to work, let your hubby handle it.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	I'm sure your husband can handle everything.  Your love for your children is admirable, but since your the only source of income, I would feel obligated to be at work.  It will go along way in making your boss feel that your a good employee and he made the right decision in giving you a full time position.  Good luck and I hope the children all get well soon.|`|IPS3hWweaa	No, don't miss work, right now is not a good time to be missing work unless you absolutely have to. Just leave the kids with your hubby, he'll do a good job.
djUMvICoaa	If they like sports, what team they like and why.  If they like traveling, where have they been, what they liked there and what they didn't.  If they lived elsewhere where was it and why did they move, how do they feel about it now, good or bad?  What do they do for a living, again how much they like it or don't and why.  What advice they might give you if you were looking to enter that  field.  What schooling they had or had to have and where?  If they like being asked a lot of questions by an unknown?lol.|`|bZGv0dvnaa	wanna come in?....|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	are you single
OntO6wE4aa	Even with friends their are boundaries you don't cross. You have to question your friendship when he hurts you at every chance he gets. You have to get him alone and communicate to him your feelings. If he doesn't then cut him off for awhile to show how serious you are. It sounds like he's your ride home. Choices by you have to be made. Somehow he feels he owns the right to do what he does to you. Does he give you things? He may want you as his woman and feels that some message he's sent or sending is going over your head an is showing frustration by cutting you down. What ever the reason is be strong about how you want to be treated. You saying nothing shows you as weak about how you really feel. Take care of business. Express yourself. Get your respect. Other people don't know what he says isn't true. Get support from your friends, not to gang up on him, but to show him that he doesn't have an audience any more. good luck|`|cLdGiQFXaa	I'm guessing he is mad at you for something, but to embarrassed to state wht it is. Or he has a big crush on you and doesnt know how to show it, thus embarrasing you and insulting you.<br>  <br>  My Advice is to talk to him and ask him why, or have one of his close friends ask him, why are you doing this to her?<br>  <br>  hopefully it works!|`|0YhzBgu2aa	it sounds like he likes you|`|RRL138Tlaa	Maybe he like u and don't know how to say it in a different way.On the other hand he may just like to be the center of attention and like to show off in front of friends to make himself be notice. It sounds like he only pick on u b/c he know u not going to get mad and u allow him to do it. i bet he wouldn't try this to ur others friends b/c they probably will kick his a&& and never be his friend again.Some times kids like this r called bullies.They only pick on people they know that they can do it to He is young and have a lot to learn about hurting people and close friends.When u keep doing things to hurt people and then say u r sorry then that person should not repeat the same thing over and over again if they r Truly sorry.Sorry means that he know that he have hurt u and he will not do it again b/c real friends  will respect ur feeling.If he continual to do this then it's time for u to distance ur self from him b/c one day u may give him a taste of his on medicine and he will be embarrass and this can cause a real bad argument between u two.|`|RkNIs0rSaa	beat him up after class.  LOL.. no don't do that.  Tell him that he is hurting your feelings and that if he doesn't stop you are not going to hang out with him anymore.  The key is if he does do it again you have to keep your word about the consequence.|`|4uOc515Laa	He likes you... When i like a girl i almost do the samething but i do it around a group of people i absolutly know of course.|`|6a20a722662e646b9861b6c3014628a6aa	he is just soooo immature to the point that he has to pick on you to say that he likes you.|`|CnHYgd7baa	maybe he likes you and wants to get your attention. or maybe he is just a jerk. lol|`|3FUzRANPaa	probably likes you<br>  <br>  that's what i used to do when i was a kid but not that severe|`|kgIccwR0aa	he probably has a fing 4 u and dats his way of showing it.da best remedy just go blank on him.|`|mnasIFdZaa	th way to get this one is to definitely tell him straight to STOP doing that. say something like "how many times do i have to say that i do not appreciate you embarassing and treating me like this. i can handle a lot of stuff but you just keep going on,and its starting to piss me off. so just stop doing it." say it really seriously, otherwise he will keep going . he needs to know how you want to be treated, coz thats just rude!<br>  if he has a smidge of feelings for you, he will feel more bad if you said something of that manner to him, so then he'll try and make it up to you, because i dont think he wants you literally on his bad side. <br>  he sounds weird to me<br>  anyhoo toodalooooo!|`|ojLxFfxAaa	From what I can tell, this dude is so into you especially with him wanting you to poke his cheeks cause it feels good with your soft hands. Woow! marvelous. However, he has no right to embarrass you and disrespect to you w/ or without the company of others. My suggestion for you is to tell him how you feel and make it clear to him that you will end this friendship if he does not change the way he treats you. At this point, he will start being nice to you and treat you the way you deserve as a friend or he will tell you why he was acting this way all along and then you can decide if you want to date him.<br>  <br>  P.S. I had the same experience with a guy through high school. This guy wouldn't stop being a jerk to me and once I ended the friendship, days after he asked me out...so for some guys, that is their way of expressing their feelings but keep in mind YOU SHOULD NOT BE MISERABLE FOR ANYONE!!!|`|3jqcLj7Saa	when he starts his teasing avoid him, turn him off and walk away, soon he will realize something is wrong and ask. when he opens the door let him know you do not like being the butt of his jokes and how much it hurts. ask him to stop or keep avoiding him when he does it again. sooner or later he will get the picture. No one likes being put down in front of there friends.|`|uIuatdkyaa	I get that so much from my guy friends as well! Don't worry about it, I don't know why he's doing it, but he definately isn't the only one! I'm guessing they maybe do it, so that they don't look stupid around you, because they are making you look stupid in front of everyone else, if that makes sense. I don't know, sorry I couldn't be of more help!|`|LS4HKzxfaa	Well it sounds like he really likes you.. But sometimes close friends when you are really close and you enjoy time together, u want to get even more closer but theres nowhere closer and so you act like this.. want to hug him all the time, tickle etc... <br>      Just try to act the same way and see how will he react.. Just make jokes about him all the times.. And make laugh of him. And then just say "aww you know, im in the loving way" or "you know i don't really mean it" and let him know, how u feel like! Or just try to talk to him..<br>                                              Good luck :)|`|peckUVpzaa	A very immature way you express when you like someone. This usually applies to 11 year olds but idk how old you guys are. I'm 15 and guys who are 16 tend to stare at the person they like or try to joke around but in a decent way to make you smile rather then annoyed. It also depends on the guy I guess as as well.|`|RsUEC74qaa	He's immature,when a guy likes a gal,he always teases her,if he knows he can't get her,but like 10 year old behave like this,i say if he insults you,you insult him too,or stop talking to him,he'll stop himself !

gpL7W3jAaa	Do you already have your venue booked? If so, it be pretty hard to change the date without losing any money you aready put into it. I find it very disrepectful to both you and your fiance that all these people can not make it...especially his parents! A vacation is more important to them then their son's wedding? You need to talk to them and tell them how upset you are. Especially to the bridesmaids. They agreed to be in it knowing the date of the wedding. <br>  <br>  If I were in this situation, there is no way I'd change the date just because people were so unthoughtful to planned a vacation during the same time.|`|q8eue7CRaa	It sounds very strange that you found out this week - are they in on something? Are they going on the same trip? Are they trying to hint something???<br>  If your relationship is fine, keep the date and move ahead (and re-think these relationships with the flaky family/friends). It's shocking that the father would not be at his son's wedding. Something HAS to be up.<br>  Talk to them and find out what's going on. They should cancel their vacations - it's ridiculous!|`|crxbob5jaa	Leave it to him to decide. But I'd go ahead. It's the people who are flakes, not you. They are being extremely rude. There is no way that they can already all have obligations on Oct 22nd. I'm sorry, but there is more going on here than them having other obligations. Somethings strange.|`|wADnvKGFaa	Holy crap!!  What is wrong with these people???  I am so sorry, but there are only 2 options for you.  1)Keep the date and have these people not there.  2) change your date.<br>  <br>  Don't worry about the photographer because there are tons of good ones out there, but the family and wedding party bailing is crap.  I would try to talk to all of them and see if they cant move the vacations.<br>  <br>  Sorry that's all I can offer you.  Good luck|`|qhPQvwzGaa	if everything is booked and paid for i would go ahead with the wedding, vacations could easily be cancelled if they have travel insurance.<br>  <br>  if these people already knew your date well in advance and still went ahead making holiday plans then to be honest there not worth having at your wedding.|`|hkwBR1moaa	That's a lot of people backing out.  Not to sound mean, but are these people unreliable?  Do they not agree with the marriage?  You would think they would schedule vacations around the wedding.  It sounds like you gave them plenty of notice.|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	They dont sound like they have considered you in any of this, its all very well being really big on family but they have to be big on it too !<br>  I would get married to my love when it suits you and then have a blessing/renewal of vows next year and tell everyone in plenty of time so that they can put you first.
Hapc1N9haa	Just ask.  I am SERIOUS! Just get straight to the point, bite the bullet and do it.  You need an answer, obviously you like him and you have feelings for him so be brave and ask, maybe he's shy, he sounds shy.  This I know from personal experience, I had to tell my partner the truth about how I felt about him because I just needed to know how he felt about me also and yeah we've been dating for 1 and half years.  But the thing is even if he doesn't feel the same, it's closure.  You know how he really feels so you can move on with your life, otherwise you will always wonder and life shouldn't be like that.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps...<br>  Sammy :)|`|3HGAZDL6aa	maybe he's worried that if you meet in person you wont like him, thats why hes making excuses, its hard to know if either of will really like each other till you actually meet!|`|AA11957513	i dont think he loves u u better try for someone else
O1lm79EFaa	Eww wow Have I ever been in this situation. ONE too many times. I am Brazilian as well and my bf is a mix of middle eastern. he has tons of Middle east girls who desperately want him despite the fact that they know he's in a serious relationship with me<br>  <br>  Girls he didn't even know from across the world would make comments on his and our pictures... and I would be like You've got to be kidding me??!. I use to be really feisty lol So i have to watch my tongue because the things I wish I could have said back, but I didn't want to stoop to their level.<br>  <br>  They are definitely jealous. AND I honestly cannot blame them. I would be jealous too.<br>  <br>  SOOO what you say to them is " Bye girl, Fly girl Don't even f*cking try girl!" and you keep doing you because it's obviously working ;)<br>  <br>  <br>  Brazilians do it better. He already knows ;) If you're dating a brazilian raise your glass, if you're not raise your standards<br>  <br>  <br>  AND I also think a lot of them are so desperate to get married that they HATE to see a good guy (one of theirs) get away. they hate it even more when he upgraded and went to something better ;)<br>  <br>  best damn question on yahoo answers in a long time!|`|DW5Eqc8vaa	They are jealous|`|e5f4c192231c92a0d059825b151f7553aa	A part is cultural.<br>  Moroccans specifically believe they are the pinaccle of gods creation.<br>  <br>  There are some exceptions (you found one, apparently) but in general they think that one of them dating a lesser being is blasphemy.<br>  <br>  And, since it`s girls you are referring too - i`d guess you are just too pretty compared to them. (i know some females from Brazil, and some from Morocco - Brazilians win hands down) - so good old fashioned jealousy is definately a factor.<br>  <br>  But, just ignore them. They aren`t worth the effort, and from a mans point of view, you`ll be prettier anyway - and you cannot change that.

3jQsbszpaa	yeah you should definitely get her one and as for the type of phone that depends on how much you want to spend. if cost is no object i suggest the G1 if you want something more cost sufficient I would get her the samsung blast, Gravity, or the Sony Ericsson.

bAKbAKdzaa	you shouldn't tell your boyfriend in hopes that he'd beat kenny up. that's just not right. but. it is against the law for a guy to hit a girl. no lie. it really is. you should probably get your friends' opinions on what to do.<br>  <br>  if you only want to tell your boyfriend to make him "take care of the situation", then that's just being petty. i know. it sounds harsh. but honestly, that's the truth.<br>  <br>  [xoxo]<br>  <br>  jessica mae|`|TceoMfrDaa	Don't tell your boyfriend. That would be the worst thing you could do, stay out of Kenny's way for a while, it will be hard cause he is in your class but don't talk with him. Eventually you could talk to him about it but the situation is still hot and anything you could say to each other could only cause things to be worse. The word has probably gone around by now what he did, and it might be the case that your friends and other people wont like him because he did punch you. Trust me Im a junior, I can totally relate.|`|uXAZhWmXaa	well even though kenny bgan the fight i think u could hav just ignored him but u didn't do that . even he punched u well that's not right n how can u let a boy punch u,,u r a girl remember ? if u were so interested in fighting with him u too could hav slapped  him<br>  yes u shouldn't tell about this 2 ur bf this wouldn't b right after all the fight took place between u n kenny<br>  <br>  i hope i could help u out|`|rMmSjJ18aa	well u shouldnt have said anything rude about him<br>  <br>  i think u should just aplogise and if tats dosnt work then just walk away and forget it<br>  <br>  (p.s  ask a friend (before u go to say sorry) to come with u and stand beside u and if he says "ok i forgive u " then ask your friend to say "now kenny wat do u say to ______(ur name) ?"<br>  and he would say sorry <br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|JOtgNWrLaa	no! dont tell your boyfriend. that will get you a bad reputation. something like this you should handle independantly and maturely. dont start any fights. just ignore kenny. be stern and make it clear you're not taking any more crap from him.|`|yPX1E3Bbaa	well its your fault for saying rude stuff to kenny. but kenny also not suppose to punch you coz its not cool to punch a girl. so i would say you guys are even. how's that?|`|tL1UrAUYaa	iwant your yahoo id

cj7NTUGVaa	More than likely;<br>  <br>  She does like you but she's scared to fall in love with you so she keeps telling herself that you're lying about the way you love/like her. So she wants to back off and because she has a boyfriend she is playing it safe by not saying that she likes you or not saying she doesn't. Keep trying but don't try too hard. Make sure she knows you want to be her friend and lover b/c right now she just thinks you wanna be a lover.|`|VwcVGDzsaa	Number 1 what the hell did you lie about that crap for, she probably couldn't care less were you have been. If she likes you then it wouldn't of mattered.<br>  You lied to her at the beginning so now she will be pretty sure you will lie again so the only options you have is to get her on her own and tell her exactly how you feel and prove to her that you wont lie etc.<br>  Good luck|`|KgD3VhKYaa	I think she likes you still but has a boyfriend and that makes it more complected. Tell her you are there when she needs you and decides what she really wants and then you must back off. You will end up getting hurt if not.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|QzUldfjFaa	she wont trust you because you lied.|`|vlbCNihAaa	I think she finds it hard to trust you now but i don't think it will last forever. Do little things to show she can trust you again. If you share a problem with her and ask for her advice then that normally brings people closer together. The more you tell them things the more they are likely to tell you things, then hey presto, trust is back. Well that's only what i think. And i don't think you should back out of tomorrow, she'll know its because of her boyfriend, then again you could just feel like a third wheel, invite someone perhaps? Go along. You should still tell her what you think of this boyfriend when the trust is back, she may take your advice after all.|`|CnHYgd7baa	she don't trust you anymore but you have to prove to her that you are trustworthy. also tell her why you lied she might forgive you them. do not hang out with her and her boyfriend 2moro you don't want to look clingy and that's kinda awkward. good luck
xbzCxo8yaa	Good morning,<br>  <br>  I am 42, married with children of my own and I thank GOD each and every day that my dad was there for me for 38 years until he passed away; as a matter-of-fact, I was a daddy's girl. <br>  <br>  I think the relationship between a dad and his daughter is soooooo very important and doesn't meant it has to be the biological dad.  My parents always told me that once you nurture and/or rear a child, you are a parent.<br>  <br>  My husband is not the father of my oldest child and my oldest son went through a great deal of stress when I got married and had other children.  However, my husband stepped in and became his dad and it worked out wonderfully.<br>  <br>  I wish more parents understood the importance of not abandoning their children, tried harder to be in their lives and realized that you can be a parent without being with the other parent, your committment should always be to the children you were blessed enough to bring into this world.<br>  <br>  I hope you have a wonderful life and I'm sure you will choose a man who will be the father to your offspring that your dad wasn't to you.<br>  <br>  Good luck, stay strong and GOD BLESS|`|AA11180444	Yes it can.  When you have a father in your life, you look up to that man.  You have someone you can admire and respect, therefore you KNOW what is a good man, even if he isn't (abusive, alcoholic).  It is what you know as normal and comfortable and may chose a man like the one you know as "normal".  If you don't have that, you may look for what you decide is a good man.  I hope this makes sense.|`|ov9bpT3Taa	Hey you, ,  This is an interesting question,  you just have to do what's right for you!  That's my thought|`|6XKlW3lyaa	it certainly does something.|`|A6CuFmBtaa	Yes I do believe this, I have never met my father and since I was old enough to understand my mum has not been in many relationships but every one she was in was a complete let down, because of this it becomes part of how i perceive men. Thankfully now my mum is happily married and I am happy in a relationship also but I think if you let the idea take over you it will. Stay strong honey and don't let the past haunt you :) xx|`|3b352647c1451744c77be95b0723c695aa	It is possible, not necessary. <br>  What having a father brings to one is obviously a role model; show them what a long term relationship is. <br>  Also, you feel that you can identify yourself to someone when it comes to mannerism. <br>  Having said that, your mum might have been able to fill in a huge gap by telling you about him or by her own experience if she was in a heterosexual relationship. <br>  <br>  So, not having grown up knowing your dad is a shame, but it doesn't have to spoil your future. You too have expectations, ideals, it's a question of balance between what you'd love and what the man you love has to offer you.<br>  <br>  Good luck..|`|i4bjQbPcaa	I only think it affects you if you let it affect you.  <br>  <br>  There is no reason why you can't have 'normal' relationships.  One of my friends never knew her father and grew up with just her and her mum.  She has never had a problem with relationships with men.|`|BA0wMRuGaa	I did see my dad growing up but I personally didnt develop a great relationship with him. His lack of effort just made me feel really unwanted. He never worked either so its not like he didnt have time to see me.|`|uuJwIg9Paa	it does affect to some extent|`|YPCFzVMfaa	yes deffo...it can sometimes make you think guys are untrustworthy but dont let the lack of your dad affect how you are with guys....i dont :P|`|ifC1aFHxaa	Yes, this is very common. <br>  When a girl lacks a father figure it is very common for her to see all men as potential mates, which can lead to being far more sexually suggestive and "flirty" b/c that's how you might deal with the opposite sex. <br>  You also have no opportunity to observe a healthy relationship between a mom and dad, which makes it a lot harder to know what to do when there are arguments or decisions to make.<br>  HOWEVER, history is not destiny. You can change your family history by learning to make good choices in who you date and learning how to be a good mate to someone.<br>  Good luck, friend!
AA11934996	I am a romantic guy, buying flowers for my girlfriend, drawing a bubble bath, making a romantic meal, going for romantic walks and other random stuff like little surprises for them to find and open.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I am single at the moment and have dated women in the past who did not like these romantic gestures so it can be difficult for us old romantics to show our true colours.|`|Mt4t34KOaa	Endangered species.And craving for protected species.Its not that they don't want to be romantic.Just that the ORIGINAL guys, who are all initiative,assertive and "knows what they are doing" kind of guy, they are quite extinct by now.ALl of them prefer to act gay, get stuck in friend zone, shop with their favourite girl and do that kind of stuff like a GIRL.Cause its only these type of guys who are TRULY confident can do some stuff to do with romance.The others, don't, even if they got the idea, cuz they dun dare to do it.|`|7HYJG7q9aa	nah dudet maybe ur looking in the worng place for romantic guys maybe u have to chose if u really want a guy who is super hot or wateva or a guy that aint as hot but more of what u want in thier personality cause alot of girls want the whole package and a perfect guy but most times ur ganna have to settle for less|`|zGthY1Jeaa	No they arent.

Remember , being able to love someone is about how unself can you be from within your heart.<br>  <br>  Second of all they have lost the ability to truely communicate with each other. I dont mean partying and having a great time. Im talking about getting to your soulmate for who they really are, asking them about their dreams , and really caring about if something is bothering them.<br>  <br>  Third and most important is usually about men only. Men these days have lost the ability to become physically intimate. I hear so many women complain that their men dont hold them or hug them just for the sake of feeling their warmth and becoming close to them. These days when a man gets physically close to a woman, he isusually trying to find a way to get her into bed.. True love is so much more then just how good you can screw a woman|`|441GSyaMaa	I'm not really romantic for some reason at the moment, but I'd consider myself to be a good romantic person.

nPjMHT0Saa	Hey, You know sometimes the other person is the kinda person that has difficulty confronting other people when they hurt them u know, like maybe u did something that was not on purpose, and somehow she felt hurt but she's been having a problem telling u what u did  she didnt wanna make you sad but with time maybe she expected u to notice, u cant be quiet because the silence will kill the relationship eventualy, so u need to make the first move go to her and tell her that u need to talk seriously and ask her to be like honest with you and I think that things will workout eventually, but u know sometimes people just fall apart for no apparent reason so you just do ur part and see what happens !<br>  Goodluck ;)|`|Lfc9Zav2aa	Maybe its time for you friendship to take a rest. Maybe you should hang with some other people and wait for you friend to notice your not begging for attention anymore and for her to realize if she wants to be your best friend she has to work on the relationship.|`|JOtgNWrLaa	people change, you both may have. circumstances in her life might be different, so she might be behaving differently. you can try to talk to her about it, otherwise dont let this hold you back. find new friends, people that are more like you.<br>  <br>  i understand how it feels to drift apart from a friend that you considered your best. but theres nothing worse than hanging around with someone who you have to think twice about. maybe you could just give her time. if this persists, i suggest u move forward.
Lfc9Zav2aa	Sometimes through time friends drift away and their status changes from best/good friends to just friends. I wouldn't move on keep them as a friend but look to elevate another friend you are hanging with to Best/Good friend status. Good Luck|`|TceoMfrDaa	Don't be held down with her. Friends sometimes need something new and it sounds like that's what your friend did. If you are having a heart to heart moment with her, remind her that even though you aren't as close anymore you are still always there for her. Sooner or later she will see that the new friends she made aren't real friends and she will come back to you.|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	i would move on. there are plenty of people out there that will take the time to listen and to talk to you and not ignore you. who knows maybe your friend will end up coming back to you once she realizes that you are moving on. what ever your decision is you have to stay strong and not let this get the best of you.|`|hkUzSsRZaa	I say move on darling. She forgot about you! Get a new bestfriend because this girl is not a bestfriend. Maybe she's not that into you anymore because you guys never hang out anymore. If you really want to be friends call her and ask her over to your house, for a sleepover or something. Friends need quality time together also. <br>  <br>  ~Good Luck, Lexi|`|JOtgNWrLaa	im sorry to hear about this. it can be hard to lose a great long-term friend, but for others, they can get bored of the same people and want to move on. i suggest you move on. dont make it appear you are dependant on her. move on, but maintain a friendship to a certain degree so you dont forget eachother altogether. good luck

MAYBE YOU HAVE THE LIFE THAT SHE WANTS.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	it could be very well that she sees you doing all the things she has never done and is very jealous. parents should want their children to achieve Better than what they had but not all people are mature enough to act that way no matter how old they are. you can try talking to her about it but i doubt she would admit to her jealousy. good luck sweetie.|`|Hp18CSwLaa	well, sounds to me like your mum's jealous of you. She probably had a really crappy childhood, so she envies how much you enjoy yours. <br>  <br>  On top of that, she hasn't done anything with her life (like you said) so she sees the potential you have, and she envies you even more, because she knows that you, unlike her, still have a chance to make something out of your life. She sees that you have what it takes to grow up successful and have everything she never had. And if you really were mature to bring yourself up (good job by the way), there is no reason why you shouldn't do just that.<br>  <br>  The next few years of your life are going to continue to suck, but remember that one day, you'll turn 18, leave your house, become successful, and never have to look back. your life will be your own, and you will be free. but for now, you really just have to deal with it. I'm sorry, but that's the hard truth.<br>  <br>  If i might offer a piece of advice though, even when you leave her, no matter how much you might hate her, remember that she is, and always will be your mother. Even if she hated you, she fed you and clothed you. You are indebted to her in a sense, so while you don't ever have to see her again, at least make sure she doesn't starve. put her in a home or something. you at least owe her that.<br>  <br>  and finally, remember this when you have your own kids. if they suffer from you the way you suffered from your mum, you'd be just as bad as she is.<br>  <br>  goodluck to you.

yHI6rfeUaa	Welcome to the real world.  This is the world where there is insufficient time to do all that you feel you must do.<br>  <br>  The solution is to manage, allocate, and budget your time.  Time management is the key.  Not everything at work is #1 hot priority today and not everything at home is # 1 hot priority today either.  However, today there are high priorities at work and at home.  Manage yourself to address today's highest priorities and complete them.  Tomorrow, reasses your priorities and address tomorrow's highest priorities.  Not everything will be done - only the critical few will.  <br>  <br>  For example, everyone wants a nice, clean car.  However, if you wash the car rather than get the week's groceries is the car wash the critical matter when this means no groceries for the week?  <br>  <br>  Manage your time|`|jROpVbrhaa	Put family first, thats the foundation of a marriage.And time management.|`|JPApIxo1aa	put ur family first,<br>  or u will really regret it,<br>  best of luck
kjgonYlgaa	the courts always favour the mother.  And depending how young the kids are when you hook up,  well... you could be in for many many years of this.  I've learned to look at issues as being funny,  like does she lie awake at night thinking of different ways to inconvenience our lives.  this is something you will have to deal with forever, even with the courts deciding, she will always be there.  Why don't you just look forward to the day when the kids are grown  up and they come to realize (on their own) what a jerk their mother is!  It may take years, but I promise you they will figure this out.  Meanwhile be their for them and your spouse, he will at times get very frustrated and need you as a sounding block.  Never speak negatively about her in any way around the kids, they are little sponges.  Go to their plays and events,  you are a part of their lives now.  enjoy them as they grow up,  you learn many things from children.  Just remember that their mother will always be their mother. And hair is just hair. You will do many things that she doesn't approve of , without ever causing harm to her kids, she will rant and rave but take it like water off a ducks back.  and continue to be a wonderful step mom in you family, because that is what you are.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	If they need haircuts, take them for haircuts.

But unfortunately, my two step daughters mother is the same way.  But she's insane as well.  She will call one minute wanting to know if we are getting the girls.  Before the conversation is over, she's yelling and screaming and threatening.  She hangs up, ten minutes later calls back like nothing happened.  My daughter is a hair dresser and she styled their hair once for a wedding they were in of their uncles.  Flower girls.  Because my daughter styled their hair, she was so mad she shaved their heads!  I wish I could say it will get better, but I haven't seen it get better in 5 years and reading some others answers, I don't think it will.  What you need to do though, is get a good attorney who can put a stop to some of these things.  One that can get him weekly visitation rights.  And rights to all school activities.  I'm not sure what state or country you are in, but I do know that my husband is allowed to be involved in school activities and there is nothing she can do about that, other than show her A$$ in front of the school and embarrass the kids.  Therefore, we stay awake for their sake.  But being allowed to do that is a court standard order.  So get a good attorney and stop some of her childishness.  I wish you the best.

y4SUDnpaaa	I am so  surprised at the number of negative responses you received. Basically telling you it is your place to be in the home raising the children, even if your husband has absolutely no regard for you, the children  or the family needs, like buying a motorcycle instead of the car he promised   for you to grocery shop, take the kids to school, the doctor or to a park, there are numerous reasons a stay  at home mom legitimately needs a car. Then squandering, what should be family money on thousands of dollars of guns and the icing on the cake he slaps you ( which is definitely abuse) you while your're in the hospital holding the newborn and in the presence of your 8 year old because you objected him going motorcycling with his friends.If he hits you again don't hestitate for one minute before calling the police. They may have ideas on how you can get help while waiting for the divorce and the money from him. He is not a good husband, father, family provider and is an abuser if it thinks the occassion calls for it.. I'm in favor of stay at home moms raising their own children but not at this cost. You know you need to get away, get a job and child care but don't see how that is possible. You have to make it possible.  Do you have family or friends who could take you in and watch the kids so you can get a job? Seems only one of them is not of school age so the others would be gone most of the day.File for and get a divorce as soon as possible then you'll get childsupport which will help you immensely. You will likely  also qualify  for  spousal support until you get a job since you've never worked and/or job training  There are lots of lawyers, the women attorneys are especially aggressive, that will make your husband pay your attorney fees since you have no money of your own. I personally know of two cases where all of this has happened, spousal support and him paying your attorney fees. If you know anyone whose used a divorce attorney start with that one and schedule a conference, he/she can answer your questions. I may be wrong but I'm not sure they charge unless they take the case and you want him paying the fees. I  know that's alot to do for someone in your circumstannces but you have to start somewhere for a better future for you and your children. If he hits you again do not hesitate for one moment for calling the police. They'll take his sorry a** to jail and have lots of advice for temporary things for you and the kids until you get on your feet and you will. You're the only one who can get you and your kids out of this nightmare of a marriage and you have to keep at it until you come up with some kind of plan. You have to get you and your children out of this miserable situation. You'll get through it somehow, I know it. Getting a divorce is the key to most of your immediate financial problems. Also when you're single you'll probably qualify for some government assistance...........if you do don't be too proud to take it, it will only be temporary.|`|zhk8o514aa	Why from your story of course your husband is a jerk.

That's great! However, did you two not discuss how the house would be run?<br>  <br>  Yes, you have more time to spend on cleaning. Yes, some things should be up to you. However, that's no excuse for him to do NOTHING. <br>  <br>  I think it's time to sit down and have a money talk. You need a car. End of story. There needs to be some give and take, but it's also not fair for you to just take the victim approach. You aren't a blameless victim, and once you take that ground you are going to be in trouble. <br>  <br>  Talk to him about this. Give him a "bill" for your work and explain that while you don't work outside of the home, you are in a 24-hour, always on-call work enviornment. <br>  <br>  Before this goes any further, TALK TO HIM.|`|KwNpyp3saa	If it is your job to take care of the kids, when are you going to have time to get a "real" job? You are absolutely right. It is too expensive to put the kids in day care. They are his kids too! It is his responsibility to take care of his kids and spend time with them. Make sure you and the kids can go to doctor visits. <br>  <br>  I think he is being very immature. He promises things for you, which are practical things, and chooses to buy things for himself. You should see about going to marriage counseling. If he doesn't want to go, you should go without him. If things don't get better you should look in to services that provide attorneys for people who can not pay and see what your rights are and maybe getting divorced. Maybe he would think how expensive it would be to pay child support for four kids. I hope things work out for you.|`|eUUcriANaa	This is not how your husband should treat you. I would have left him along time ago. He should put you first and if he is out buying guns and harleys and you don't have a car well guess what I would do while he was at work I would sell them and take the money and buy me a car. This guy is a jerk! I have been married for 28 years and my husband treats me very well. Your husband is selfish and you need to wise up,. There are plenty on men out there that would take care of you and your children. Do not settle! Tell him to shape up or ship out. Stand up to him and tell him you are sick of his crap. Bewst wishes.|`|9tf9VF9naa	you husband is a selfish jerk 100%. you both need counselling. i dont think talking will do anything good. ask for a salary  at the end of the month for everything you do.<br>  and  please dont get pregnant again|`|tCI8ksvdaa	I am amazed you are still married and not divorced.  I think you are stupid if you don't divorce him!|`|0wdEcNk1aa	Your husband is a jerk. His controlling the oney and denying you a vehicle is his way of controlling you and keeping you in "your place". Normally I would tell you to consider divorce, but with 4 young children that would be irresponsible and harmful to all five of you. <br>  <br>  So, think outside the box. You need money but can't afford the daycare. How about be a daycare provider? You could supplement your income substantially by taking in 2-3 children to watch every day and that would not stretch your energies too far. Not only would this give you money to get teh things you and the children need but it would give you some to put aside (in a separate account) so that you can have a nest egg for when you CAN leave his selfish controlling butt!|`|AA11180444	Well....what about state help to pay for daycare?  I'd tell the husband that if the state cannot help pay for daycare you cannot get a job or else this....if you get a job, he pays for the daycare.  Ask him to help you get a job and resolve the daycare expense.  It does take two incomes to make it these days.  He should want to help you out, as much as you should want to help him out.  You get a job to help pay for things that you want too, and he help you resolve the daycare issue.  He is trying to better the family by working full time and going to school to get a better job, maybe you should try a little harder too.  Men think all we do is sit home all day...<br>  <br>  Well if you had a job you'd be essentially doing what he is doing, doing two things to better the family, taking care of the home and working too...like he is working and going to school.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11923501	Selfish jerk.At what point would you quit having his children.The thought of you bending over backwards sounds good.The 100 dollars a month on beer I defend.The harley and guns when you have nothing to get the kids to and from school is ridicilous.|`|DNCpCjqjaa	Your husband is a jerk and probably likes making you feel like you have no control.  If I were you I would try to get somewhere to stay and maybe find some kind of job if anyway possible and try to find a babysitter for your kids that aren't in school and once you get some money you won't have to be dependent on your husband...just see if it would be some way possible to leave...it's not like he's giving you anything now anyways...or have a serious talk with him and tell him how you feel and it's ridiculous what he's doing!|`|gYWDrHVFaa	He sounds like a big jerk to me!  Stop having more kids with this man!  Why don't you go to counseling so an outsider can give him a clue as to what an ahole he is being.  He apparently doesn't even see what he's doing to you.<br>  <br>  You NEED a car in case of an emergency.  Can you talk to his family or mother and maybe get them to smack some sense into him?|`|hIzQyflqaa	i would leave him! i hate it when men think that it is your job to do everything in the home, especially when you have the stress of basically bringing up 4 kids on your own! perhaps it would be better for you to be a single mum, he sounds selfish and he is the bread winner so should be supporting you financially, the fact that he doesnt even buy his children clothes is disgusting! my husband never buys anything for himself if things are needed for me and my son, he will spend maybe Ôø°10 on himself in a month on a treat like a CD or summit and the rest goes on bills and his family!|`|15ad66d7bc3151bfa1bbf08f596456caaa	Divorce his but - make him pay child support - you will get the house until the last kid is 18.  The child support alone would be good money and then you can get state assistance - get a job and get a life that will make you happy.  Tell him to get out - if he hits you call the cops and have PFA put on his sorry A$$.|`|PWN5rqgxaa	you are an amazing mother and a very devoted wife...  he needs to wake the hell up and realize he is father to 4 kids who need things besides beer and motorcycles... and wake the hell up and find out what an amazing woman he is married to before its too late for him|`|XfuHpwfjaa	Your husband is an ***.  He is a typical self centered, selfish, abusive jerk.  I would pack my stuff and move out as quick as I could.  Please find yourself another man.

There is his version, your version and the truth somewhere in the middle.  <br>  <br>  First thing I want to say to you.  IT IS NEVER OK TO HIT!  <br>  <br>  Have you ever heard the saying, "We teach people how to treat us?"  Somewhere along the way your husband got the message that it was ok to indulge himself at you and your childrens' expense.  So change the message. <br>  <br>  It sounds like you have given all of your power in this relationship away. You will have to begin taking that power back a little bit at a time.  It has probably taken years to give it away and will take some time to take it back.  Taking an abrupt approach to reclaiming your power will create so much conflict you will re-think your decision to empower yourself.  <br>  <br>  If you want him involved, get creative.  As mothers we can be quite creative at getting children to do things they don't want to do.  As cliche' as it sounds, you have to train your husband!<br>  <br>  Stop blaming and name calling and searching for someone to validate your feelings of entittlement.  Your feelings are your feelings, right or wrong.  You married this guy so there must have been something you liked about him!  <br>  <br>  Get some help.  Learn how to communicate better.  Learn how to take your power back.  Learn how to value yourself and others.  Resourses are countless.  Counciling is available on a sliding fee.  Go to any book store and there is an endless number of books on relationships and self improvement.  Probably not what you wanted to hear, but if you want things to change you have some work to do.<br>  <br>  One big thing to remember is that you are teaching your children by example.  Your children are absorbing their environment, so unless you want each of them to have relationships just like yours I suggest you get busy and start changing things.<br>  <br>  I hope there is something here you can use.  Sorry to disappoint you if you were looking for a pity party or a husband bashing session.  Get out of the problem and into the solution. (Much easier said than done!)<br>  <br>  Take a very close look at the abuse.<br>   <br>  Best of luck to you<br>  Cookie|`|5mTKspfYaa	you're marriage is in turmoil...  you need to do several things.  Number one - see a marriage counselor and hope that they tell you it's not over yet.  It doesn't sound like there is ANY romance left in this relationship.  Think about why you fell in love with him.  Has he changed, why?  Stress?  Have you changed?<br>  <br>  Do you make time JUST for you two, away from the kids?<br>  <br>  YES you have the right to ask for things, and it sounds like youre a prisoner in your own home.<br>  <br>  Number two: yes, think about getting a job.  How much money would you make and would it pay for child care and a vehicle.  If not - SELL THE HARLEY - and get a car that will get you to and from work<br>  <br>  Number three:  refer to number one....<br>  <br>  YOU DESERVE TO LIVE LIFE|`|GelhbRdvaa	C'mon now girl....what is your responsibility in all this. Sounds like you're playing the victim. You had a little something to do with deciding to have 4 kids right?? <br>  You married a very immature man who puts himself first. You do have some options though for extra income. As long as you're stuck at home, as you put it, why don't you do some babysitting on the side. It would be a good first step in earning some money of your own.|`|TZpFcx47aa	WITH him you dont qualify for state care. Without him, you would qualify for lots of things. He is abusive. There are womens shelters most everywhere that could get you on the right road to child support, state aid, job training, free child care, you name it. Commit your mind to NOT having your kids see an abusive home. If you dont have a friend or relative who can take you and your kids away from there, then call the non emergency police numbers. They may be able to get you and your kids a ride out of there and to a shelter. And remember to clear this ?? of yours out of your history and cookies so he cant come looking for you. good luck.|`|aXB3DjtZaa	Your husband is a f******* d*** head. That is not fair in any way. I would flip out on him. I would never be able to live that way. I don't no how you did it for so long. I bet you can't but i would get ride of him. He sounds like the guy my dad use to be before my mom left him.

AA10057192	Well, there was obviously a reason that you trusted him enough after meeting him online that you would feel safe doing so in real life. If you're confident that you made the right decision in that regard then I think you shouldn't have a problem telling your parents about him.<br>  <br>  I would suggest asking them if they think it would be ok for you to date a guy you've become "friends" with online instead of telling them you're already dating. It is usually better not to lie to your parents, but in this case they probably wouldn't even think that your relationship is serious anyway. <br>  <br>  In the end though, it doesn't matter that you're a minor because your parents really can't tell you who to associate with And if you think they're going to be unreasonable about this then you don't have to tell them anything. <br>  <br>  I'm not a parent myself, but I have a lot of experience with my own crazy parents. As far as that other answerer goes, they may be a reasonable parent but that doesn't mean yours are.|`|GegQJNzSaa	My 24 year old daughter has been talking to the same guy she met on my space for 3 years.He is the same age. I have seen pictures of him and the things he likes to do,the troubles hes had. His choices he has made. He seemed ok. Then my daughter said she wants to move down south to be with him. I said,have him come up so the family can meet him.He left for the south today after two weeks of visiting the family. We all feel better knowing him,and she has our blessings. My kids always talked to us about the things going on in their lives,never did hide too much. They actually think they have reasonable parents! If my daughter was 18 I might have a problem with all this. But my daughter has been on her own for a while and can take care of herself. If something were to happen she could take care of herself again! How old is this guy? That will have alot to do with this. If he is your age it might not me so bad. Let your family meet him.
j4H4o6W4aa	I think is time you sit with him and define the type of relationship you both have!! so nobody will get confused!!! and it is pretty obvious to me that he likes you but maybe he wants you to tell him that you like him too...so go my friend!!!|`|118f5b8cbe4a93ac9b9bce5079cd3898aa	he's playing hard to get.  play back. don't be needy or clingy.  guys hate that.|`|S0QQ6D92aa	i don't really think he ignores you does he? maybe he's shy...|`|M0KLWw54aa	u should ask him wat's with him|`|Uo2fZM78aa	He's an a s s!<br>  be done with him.<br>  hes just gonnan use you,|`|1hciyvKdaa	Men will always treat you the way you allow them to, end of story.

A guy that's really into you wouldn't be put out too much by a lot of text messages.  But I would cut down on them anyway, they send a message that you are desperate.  Are you?  Wait until you get into college, there are going to be so many boys it'll be like being on Fantasy Island.  Someone is going to be caught up in who you are and you won't have to go chasing after him, he'll be chasing after you.  Don't set your goals to low, you have a long time in which to find Mr. Right.

You immediately set up a challenge and he has to win you. but you need to leave it a few days so he knows you're serious. its a game .. girls dont like games as much as guys do - trust me on this one! if he's in any way keen he'll bite!
aDhZIhQcaa	My daughter (she's 29) went through this same situation, 4 years ago.  But they met in court, during cases that involved their estranged spouses.  They now, have been married for 2 years.  LOL  It seems to me that you are interested in this woman and may not even realize it.  Just don't use her and hurt her.  She has been through enough.  And there are children involved.  What I don't understand is why you would even care what your prospective ex's would even think about your relationship with this "other" woman?  Do you still harbour feelings for your ex and that is why you want to give her a payback?  And if you do, don't lead this woman friend on.  I personally, would just go with the flow.  You don't have anything to hide, do you?  And why be embarrased or uncomfortable when it is obvious what choice your wife made?  One thing I can tell you is, don't lower yourself to a level of getting in the mud with anyone.  Be the better man and rise above any vindictiveness you may feel.  Your ex and her new guy won't be hurt, but you will cut your nose off despite yourself, and any children's that are involved, too.  Good Luck|`|AA11297232	Two wrongs don't make a right.

And thank him for taking her off your hands and giving you something much better.|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	I would go for major payback (as long it doesnt mean you loose money or access to your children).<br>  Tell her you have been having loads of affairs with women!|`|BJERgbM5aa	If it's really over, it over.  No matter why or who is seeing who and doing what.  If it's really over, end it.  Forget payback.  Never works.  In domestic situations, payback usually kicks you in the a**.  End it.  BUT, when there's thoughts of payback, it can mean that there's a chance for a reconciliation.  When you're really alone and calm, think about that.  And also think about talking to the 'almost' ex about that.  Maybe she's open to talking. Either way it goes, it would do you both (and the kids) a world of good.  Good Luck.|`|mobG2SVZaa	Im getting divorced not through an affair but to be quite honest with you i couldnt care less what she does and what she thinks about what i do<br>  <br>  just get on with your life and enjoy yourself|`|iPNOVR6Gaa	Sad that you're not over her.  The opposite of love is not hate, it's indifference.  Your desire to get back at her proves that you still have feelings for her.  Rather than telling her that you've been having sex with that woman, I think you'd be better served telling her that, unlike her, you are capable of having a friendship with a member of the opposite sex without having sex with her.|`|nBQeSu2faa	Don't do it...just get the divorce over and done with.  Of course you must feel very hurt but why make things any worse. Remember there are children involved and you really need to make this passage as easy as possible for them. Just one more thing..it's good that you get on with the other wife but DON'T be in a hurry to get into another relationship,give yourself time to recover from the break up of your marriage.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	Payback is never the way forward trust me it is not. <br>  The best revenge you could have would be to move on with your life and not give your cheating soon to be ex-wife another chance.<br>  <br>  Concentrate on the children as they are the ones that will suffer if you and your Ex wife are at loggerheads.|`|zYLVruzMaa	Go for the payback.Its like winning the lottery.Good luck to you mate.Im on your side

Continue to talk to her till you reach a comfortable stage then once you get to know her (face to face) let her know you have a crush on her. Remember the early bird gets the worm so be confident and when the time is right let her know how you feel.<br>  Latez -Gail|`|Ks0BrqHBaa	keep talking to her. who knows maybe things will work out. but when you do talk to her stay as friends while she ges used to her new surroundings. once she gets used to the people and the places that are around then try and take it to the next level. don't rush into things it might ruin your chances with her.|`|siNDaB31aa	the age difference is not a problem.

He was jerk to you before and now you are so desperate for his affection and attention.  <br>  <br>  Listen to your sentence.<br>  <br>  EVERY time I walk by him, he HAS to touch me.

He has no right to put his hands on you when you have told him to stop.|`|6wxgyGy5aa	I think you need to tell this guy that he's crossing the line by constantly touching you.

AA12287411	It sounds like she guesses correctly that <br>  "friends" isn't enough of a starting point with you.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	you are lucky to ask this online rather than in person because etiquette dictates that you get a firm bitttch slap across the face to bring you back into reality over a question like that|`|OWqz9EuFaa	not the same, but pretty damn close. maybe you should move on.........?|`|8FbOtXAXaa	You have to understand that she only looks at you as a friend and I know it's tough to talk to her again and see that she has another boyfriend when you liked her so much, but you would be wasting so much time and energy on thinking about her when you could be out doing fun activities and meeting a girl or girl friends that way. First of all I would just focus more on getting involved with school or sports or anything that you like and meet other girls that way. Spend more time with your friends and go out and have fun. Hope this helps you out.|`|eVF7mhE9aa	I noticed that guys crave a certain kind of attention and it doesnt matter how ugly or hot the girl is, if she gives you the attention, you automatically like them. Anyway, just think of her like another girl dating another guy and go find someone else.|`|COhYuTj3aa	Damn.......This is one of those moments where you gotta step up to the plate.

Ask him how he feels.|`|PpYl2dFVaa	possible its lust for you
iP863XM6aa	Well, if her best friend knows, chances are she does actually know but acting like she doesnt so that you guys dont end up all shy around each other and stuff. <br>  The fact that she's always trying to be close to you indiciates that the does in fact like you. If she didnt, she'd probably try to stay away from you to give you a clue. Now that she's getting close though, it probably means she likes you two and is probably waiting for you to make a move. Talk to her, ask her on a date or something... I think your chances look good :)|`|9EkFrApiaa	Have confidence and ask her out.|`|KqWivPpAaa	dude, no offense but you need to grow some balls. just tell her you like her in your own way and after you get that out of the way, go at your own pace. fear + time = no girl just do it.|`|ZrrGygBPaa	BE A REAL MAN AND ASK HER|`|82bMFhs4aa	well just askk her how she feels bout you|`|c34fe6942e88ad410cb5df6ea2560fe4aa	i think she might know .. ask her and see .. thats the only way you are going to find out ^_^|`|2BesFBv9aa	Sounds as though she does like you, and if her best friend knows That you like her, then I can guarantee you that "she" knows too! So I guess it's time to "bite the bullet" and ask her out.

KVITKXuvaa	She is interested 100%|`|veeC7Rvvaa	She seems flirty, whether she's interested in you as a friend or as a potential lover is something yet to be unraveled. Go ahead and message her and don't go around calling a girl you just met babe.. makes it sound as if you call every girl ''babe''. I wouldn't take a guy who calls me babe straight away seriously, because he would sound like a player to me.. ladies man.. and I wouldn't even believe him if he said he loves me later on, because of how easy and fast he stepped out of the line in the beginin by calling me his babe when he doesnt even know me that well.|`|80aDsO21aa	I wouldn't jump the gun and said she's interested in you for more then a friend. Whenever I get a text I always text back as soon as I get it, she might be like me and has her phone in her hand at all times. I flirt with everyone (in a non whoreish way) but that's my way of being friendly and I do it to people I'm not interested in. It's up to you to make the next move to see if she wants you more then a friend.|`|0DdSoi4Maa	Well if they were quick responses she's not playing hard to get & I know when most girls like a guy they play hard to get.  I would just keep texting & see where it leads.|`|6JAXZlG5aa	If she tested you back and flirted she's def likes you.You should hint at hanging out be like maybe one day your free we can chill should hang out with her once or twice just 2 makes sure you really like her|`|WuxsTx1taa	i'd say its def possible shes interested, ask her out to the movies and see what happens :) goodluck|`|5erRkNIFaa	She is being friendly...

sGP6s7uraa	Since the money WILL BE DONATED to charity, I think that is a wonderful idea! Just make sure you tell your guests that the "proceeds" (not sure exactly what you can call it) will got to St. Jude's in honor of your grandmother.  Note of caution: my cousin did this (for her own monetary gain though ~sigh~) and about $30 was stolen (really sad considering it was close friends and family!) from the bag they were keeping it in.  My suggestion is to decorated or find a lock box to put the money in so this doesn't happen to your fund.  Best of luck to you and your future husband!<br>  <br>  <br>  ok, who's the troll...?|`|WyCmQBuvaa	I think it is a beautiful idea.  You are remembering your grandmother and she will "be" there. <br>  <br>  I have no clue what the dollar dance is.  Just make sure the guests do so they have singles to donate to this worthy cause and don't look like a putz or something.<br>  Congratulations.|`|AA11380378	Any solicitation of money on a wedding is tasteless, regardless of what you will be doing with the money.<br>  <br>  If the cause is so "close" to your heart, use your OWN money, not your guests.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|crxbob5jaa	Sounds wonderful to me!|`|yZ7vjv86aa	Sorry, hon, but this is not a good idea for many reasons.<br>  <br>  I'm an advocate of cancer research myself, but your wedding is not the place to solicit money for any reason.  It's a wedding, not a charity event.  Besides, if you want to honor someone, you should do it with your own money, not someone else's.<br>  <br>  Find another way to honor your grandma on your special day, either with a prayer, mentioning her during the toast, or perhaps having a picture of her displayed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|a3422bad6666b60894e80bace0f14387aa	It seems I am in the minority on this one but I will state my piece anyway. If this was a charity ball for St. Jude's, it would be okay. However, when I attend a wedding I am not there to donate to charity. This is not a fundraiser, if you want to host a fundraiser for St. Jude's, seperate it from your wedding. The idea of doing both is extremely cliche to me. If you want to donate your own money to charity in your guests names, that's fine, but don't solicit donations from your guests, that's just not tactful.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0BX1yFGuaa	I totally agree with Blunt!<br>  <br>  I am a huge advocate for St. Jude's CRH myself but I did not show my support through soliciting my wedding guests.<br>  <br>  I showed my support through many volunteer efforts and community fund raising efforts for St. Jude's.<br>  <br>   A dollar dance is never a good idea no matter how you spin it.|`|P0zhfe4Raa	I think it is a great idea, because the dollar dance has been like a tradition in weddings. Even if they dont know where the money is going to everybody wants to dance with the bride and groom. Good luck you are a very thoughtful person (:|`|xuiSfzgraa	I think it is a wonderful idea. I would have your DJ annouce that it will be going to a charity, so that your guest know before hand.  But I think you might even get more participation from your guest if they know they are donating to a good cause.|`|PRg9UgOlaa	I agree, make sure your guests know that all the "dancing money" will be given to charity. I was just at a wedding where they auctioned off the first dance in the dollar dance. Maybe try that for a little extra $$.|`|mQSk7fB6aa	If it's for charity, and you make it clear beforehand to your guests that this is the case, then it's a wonderful idea.|`|hkwBR1moaa	The purpose of a money dance is for the guests to shower the guests with money to help out with expenses.  The guests are expecting to give you and your fiance the money not a charity.  While donating to a charity is a good cause, your wedding is not a charity event.  So if you don't want the money for yourselves, then cut out the money dance altogether.|`|0AShsMsoaa	if i wanted to go to a fundraiser i would buy a ticket to a charity fundraiser.  when i have a nice outfit on, have already bought you a gift and am spending the day at your wedding, in your honor, that is enough.  expecting me to honor your grama by giving you more money is not appropriate.  not even close to being part of a wedding.  money dances and wishing wells point you out as ignorant and clueless.  do not have them at your wedding.  if you must, mention your grama in a toast, briefly.  please, for petes sake.

You now have the child's feelings to think about. If you get back together and its a messy break-up, the little boy/girl will have no trust for guys in later life as she would have never grown up with a father figure who is always there.

If you get back together and its a messy break-up, the little boy/girl will have no trust for guys in later life as she would have never grown up with a father figure who is always there.

C7DOTjhqaa	In my opinion, you should thank your lucky stars you avoided any deeper involvement with this one.  Let her go, and look for a girl who shares your values as far as drinking and partying are concerned.  She is trying to play you now that she realizes her control over you is waning.  Let her go.<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|6fwEF5ATaa	Pursue her again, but as a challenge this time. <br>  <br>  Call her tell her its you and tell her to meet you like right outside. Then hang up immediately. She comes out, surprise her with something. Tickets to something she really likes, or a gift she really likes. <br>  <br>  Then tell her this is your goodbye gift then give her a kiss. Walk away. Call her again a few months later, see how things are. If she's still the same then there is not much sense wasting your time.|`|5FdFIyguaa	sorry after reading ur long post i forget ur question <br>  okay <br>  as in my opinion u should dump her and search for a new one|`|MtsfAnXVaa	i never read one word of that but i'm just going to say, maybe you should find her and be like whats up b!!tchhh?|`|IPbbIPh4aa	Dude, maybe you are moving too slow? You said you had been dating her for a few months before you told her you liked her o.O Maybe she was looking for you to step it up a gear and go back to her place for "coffee"! Move in for the kill!!!! :) So thats why things probably went sour in the first place (when she went looking elsewhere for some male attention). Then she hits you with that classic text "don't you like me anymore :(" (sad face lol) this is when you start running! She is obviously loving the attention you give her and wants it ONLY WHEN it suits her! thats totally unfair, you sound like you have a fairly good understanding of social interactions but I think if you really wanna be with someone then you need to presue it harder (lol) and go get some booty, thats probably why she didn't seem keen after a while of the same old texting and chatting, be spontaneous (women love it) and do something daring. Good luck man, and remember there are ALWAYS more fish in the sea! BOOM|`|Zj9pycyUaa	umm basically when you get to about 19 more then one dates mean your dating so if she was seeing somone after all tht time of texting and dating its basically like cheating on you so if i was you i would just move on and find somone else|`|tg0LPOKfaa	this could go on and on and on u know! u trying to fix things with her, is it going to do u good in the long term if u fail? she wouldn't hide things from u if she was sincere. i am sorry but STOP hurting yourself!:)

Love is pain, tragedy, and hate. Love is psychosis. Love is fooling yourself. Love is being too weak to accept the fact that you are alone, completely, and the only thing that can be Truly understood and verified is the self. Live in your own world and realize we are all aliens and no one understands or cares about anyone else. It is all a bunch of lies. It is preconditioned responses we are taught we are supposed to have and feel. No one feels empathy or compassion who doesn't choose to. Those are easily led and controlled sheep. Don't be a sheep, be a wolf.<br>  <br>  Wolves understand we are in the wild, there is no civilization and all the feelings and emotions are meaningless nonsense. But they are a vulnerability.

Don't get too attached because you will want to actually meet them in person which will be the problem.  Have you ever had a real boyfriend?<br>  <br>   if not, this could be normal behavior.  You are absolutely right guys are fun but they can be trouble and bring a lot of joy pain and heart break so be careful. <br>  <br>  *Do not attempt to meet any of these men or boys even if they came to you<br>  <br>  And i dont think they are serious either when they say i love you too.. so they know you are just teasing when you say i love you. they just want to have fun as well.

Never write anything you don't have to! <br>  If it comes to NEEDING to tell, then I'd talk to your mom alone when your teasing siblings aren't around and tell her exactly WHY you weren't truthful - you are afraid of how you will be treated.<br>  Might not work, b/c it sounds like the way your family operates is to cut each other down pretty regularly and your mom is probably a part of that.<br>  Good luck, dear.|`|AA11715395	My family were like that too, the only girl of the family. Just tell them, they'll get over it eventually and find something else to entertain themselves.  Don't even worry about the MSN thing, if they bring it up, say it's just a conincidence..|`|RP6Xmvxsaa	just tell the truth don t hide anything that s your own family they are the one will help you if you are in trouble|`|x7uYAPaSaa	I went out with a guy, and i never told my parents that i was going out with him for over 6 months. Eventually i sat down my mum first, and kind of hinted i was smittened by this guy, and he liked me back. He came back from a visit, and i asked my mum and dad to pick him up from the train station. We came out the station holding hands, and they pretty much got the message then and havent mentioned anything since.<br>  Make small hints to your parents before blurting it out<br>  Hope it helps a little|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	Please dont do something STOOPID and get pregnant will you ! I hope you are not having sex since thats illegal at your age and you will only give your parents somethin to get crazy about if they find out.<br>  I personally dont see any harm in having a boy for a friend or a girl for a friend, tell your mum you have got friendly with this boy in school/your class/whatever and say you dont want her to think you are "dating" but just going out as friends. She cant complain about that can she ? introduce him to them and let your parents see you are sensible and trustworthy.|`|bFOqf40zaa	if ur parents r strict prepare to say goodbye.  If they don't then they won't care.
AA11441704	become a good friend...........ask her to meet you some place etc........|`|KCpGsN2faa	Make cupcakes/ cookies (or even buy them) and spell out on them "Will you go to prom with me?" If you ask her in a unique way and she says 'no', either she is pretty heartless or she already has a date.
TU34il8Taa	aww he seems like a really good friend ure lucky to have him so maybe next time ure playing 20 questions ask him if he would eva go out with u and that will answer ure question, when my guy friends and me play 20 questions that is something i ask them all.|`|MsPvIqoraa	yeah i would have to say he likes you thats the first things i notice about a girl and if you talk all the time he prolly already thinks about you so make him feel confident guys are scared of rejection hope this helps|`|AA10663684	wow, i so dont miss the high school drama, sorry
RC8Pxx8eaa	If you have a maid then you have some status in society, you can deny everything and you will be believed, not her. My guess is she wont say anything anyway, who would she tell ? If she told your parents she will have to say something embarrassing for her so I am sure she wont say anything, ignore it and it will go away.|`|hHndD5SEaa	I can assure you shes not going to tell anyone! Shes probably more embarassed by this than anything and wont want to risk her job|`|d5sAojVmaa	Don't worry about it, its something that people do. If it gets brought up and your parents find out then just tell them the situation. Or if your that afraid of her telling your parents then talk to her and simply say it wasn't meant for you to walk in can you not tell my parents the situation. I think your being more paranoid about it then you should be. but you know i'm not the one in that situation.|`|ifC1aFHxaa	She's not going to say anything. This is as embarrassing for her as it is for you.<br>  Maids see a lot already and I am pretty sure this is really nothing new. I am also pretty sure that there is a lot of gossip among themselves, but telling on you? Please.<br>  Learn to lock the door, pal!|`|15e58edf21f33dd475298413b3cd6d8caa	is she fine ? lol  if it bothers u that much get her alone alone & say im sorry that happen but it was my private moment (like when you take a sh_t ) let me know if she falls in love with you ?  lol|`|898830adaaee3711055b572d5b56d3e8aa	Do that again.

AA11441704	C'est bon idee.|`|3047dd6618622823b544c55daf1b8a58aa	I would say, don't do that. She will see right through the pretence. <br>  <br>  Perhaps you could offer to take her to see a French film. Or take a French language course together, or French history course together, or something like that. <br>  <br>  So, you can say something like, I see you're very interested in French culture, maybe we could etc etc<br>  <br>  If you can't afford to take her to see a French film, you could hire/buy a French dvd from a library or wherever, and then offer to watch it with her, but be on your best behaviour. Don't try to kiss her or touch her or anything like that, or else she'll think that you're only trying to get some!<br>  <br>  If you're old enough, you could even go on a French wine tasting course together. Basically, anything that involves French culture may interest her, and that way you're both just hanging out, and it will smooth things a bit.|`|JrWWvnMBaa	That's a really good idea. It also shows you have found out about her interests which a girl would really like. However, make sure to do it right, you don't want  to go up and ask her if she has a gran or you think shes fat!|`|rwGTRUj0aa	If she doesn't know what it means in french then you'll just have to explain it to her anyways. might as well do it in english. you dont want to start out a relationship having to explain something to her and making her feel dumb.|`|37c233fdcf66a7d0f3a3f1d9528d7a4caa	It could be cute.<br>  <br>  Just make sure you say it right.|`|pd9GW1Meaa	omg, thats like so totally cute :)<br>  <br>  go for it, oh and give her a rose , oh now thats so sweet <3

Obviously he thinks you will want him back if he throws it in your face that he is making a permanent commitment to someone else. He sounds like a needy jerk, I would hold your ground and stay away from him. He probably won't even get married if you aren't jealous|`|b4199464cc3098e9c0df20d7671bd92baa	He is hoping you would stop him.|`|RLoilwCNaa	What a jerk. Good riddens.|`|7HYJG7q9aa	ya he prob is jealous and very desperate|`|1JtnI4SEaa	Probably because you do have kids together so he thought that you should know in order to help explain it to them, and because he might want them involved in the wedding. Also, because he knows that he can use this as a way to mess with your head. Just tell him congratulations and don't pay him any attention.|`|6a20a722662e646b9861b6c3014628a6aa	he is just trying to get a reaction outta you. maybe he thinks if he says that you will come back with him.

wzM5WB8Xaa	Almost every girl alive loves chocolate, but in order to stay hot, we balance it out with eating things like spinach, chicken breast, and fruit. Of course, if your definition of hot means having a few curves, then probably chocolate, pasta, and salads that really aren't that good for us.|`|ASLbRwQ8aa	none so we dont get fat|`|viR8Sf01aa	McDonalds.
uzxwqKl9aa	The answer is NO, you should not be Facebook friends anymore. I speak from experience. I was "friends" with my boyfriend after we broke up. Want to know why it took forever to get over him? Because I could see his every move on Myspace and Facebook! I would check his comments daily to see if there were new girls and when there were, it broke my heart all over again. Knowing where he was all the time made me want to be with him more. If you ever want to move on, this sort of thing is very unhealthy. If you really loved her, Facebook will only make you long for her and you'll snoop around in her life.|`|VEgv5NhSaa	delete, always the best solution on facebook<br>  <br>  if she does find out say that someone hacked into your account ;)|`|UJJ8ObnXaa	It doesn't tell them if you take them off your list so it doesn't even matter really|`|t3G5xSbIaa	lsn if u entirely moved on and there's no sourse of feelings between u guys u can be friends and still talk but u gotta check how she's doin 1st!|`|eNEgKxfJaa	who broke up with whom?<br>  <br>  if she broke up with you then talk to her honestly and tell her that you really need to mourn the relationship and that you want to move on... and you cannot do that with still being in contact... for a healthy break up, all contact needs to be severed unless it was completely mutual or something... <br>  <br>  i understand that you dont wanna seem mean but you also have to consider your feelings and that you need to move on from this...|`|eVF7mhE9aa	I think of ex's like some sort of cancer.

Aren't you worried about hurting MY feelings?<br>  <br>  You shared some space with this female.   Ok.   I get that.   You thought of her as "special" at one point in time.   Ok.  I get that too.  But didn't you break up with her 2 weeks ago?   Doesn't that put her back in the same category as what I am in?<br>  <br>  The "just another person out there" category.<br>  <br>  I do believe it does.<br>  <br>  If seeing her update her facebook status is causing you some discomfort, then DE-FRIEND HER !!!    Because I guarantee you, SHE isn't feeling an ounce of the pain that you are.   And since she isn't feeling that pain, why do you insist on wallowing in it?<br>  <br>  Grow a pair of balls and take her off your friend's list.|`|vKvNDPbDaa	if it hurts you, yes delete her.  if it bothers her she will call you and you can tell her why.

Although sex with the person you love is the ultimate sexual experience, a man who talks about sex from the first date is simply horny and looking to get laid.  Love has nothing to do with it.  So don't try convincing yourself this guy has love on the mind.  It hasn't even entered the ballpark.

AA11121801	You can go to stores like macy's, kohls, jcpenney, or even walmart if you want inexpensive clothes and more to see some good babydolls, and chemise night gowns. Some of them I think come with panties but i don't know about bra. <br>  <br>  You can go to victoria's secret for some sexy lingerie. Ask the sales ppl in the shop for help and recommendations, they will be happy to help you more accurately seeing your size and taste.

I doubt he'd like to be accused of anything when he hasn't done anything wrong.  Trust and communication are two of the biggest components of marriage.

IezZuF9oaa	A kiss is a lovely trick designed by nature to stop speech when words become superfluous.<br>  "1., Great breath. An absolute must. You have got to brush your teeth thoroughly and get a bath before you meet Mr. or Mrs. Right. If you are a smoker and your partner is not, then try to refrain from smoking, as non-smokers hate to French kiss smokers. Just imagine kissing an ashtray%u2026 If you take your date out for a dinner, you should have a chewing gum or mint with you to take immediately after the dinner.<br>  <br>  2., Comfortable position. Make sure that you stand close enough to your partner or - even better - sit down side by side on a comfortable couch. You cannot really let you go if you are in an uncomfortable position.<br>  <br>  3., Relax!<br>  <br>  4., Hold your lover. Put your arm around your partner and hold gently. You can hold the shoulders, the neck or even the face, as it feels just right.<br>  <br>  5., Start with a normal kiss. You don't want to rush too fast, just start with a gentle normal kiss with your lips closed. I suggest you also close your eyes, it increases the sensations and your partner can feel embarrassed if you are staring at him or her in the middle of the action. However, this is optional.<br>  6., Open your mouth. Do not take too much time with the normal kissing, as it can make your partner feel that this is as far as it goes, which should be avoided obviously! This is a common mistake, do not fall in this trap. Gently open your mouth and draw your tongue across your partner's lips.<br>  <br>  7., Move your tongue inside your partner's mouth. Softly open up your partner's mouth using your tongue. Then place the tip of your tongue on the tip of his or her tongue. Do not force it, just play with your partner's tongue by circling it with your own. Do it lightly. Explore!<br>  <br>  8., Read the emotions and adapt. If your partner seems to like your kiss, just keep on doing passionately. Explore other areas of the mouth as well. Little more experienced kissers can try sucking the top or bottom lips, which is a very seductive kiss. But be careful, don't bite!<br>  <br>  9., Breathe through your nose. Well, don't forget to breathe in the heat of the moment so the kiss can last longer. But beware, always breath through your nose. Also don't forget to swallow.<br>  <br>  10., Kissing is not all. You may very well want to increase the sensation by using your hands too. Rub along the waist, the back, the arms and run your fingers through your partner's hair.<br>  <br>  11., Enjoy! :)<br>  <br>  1. Emotions.<br>  When you kiss someone you are in love with, your kiss will be TRULY special. The combination of physical and emotional pleasure is the key to an amazing kiss.<br>  <br>  2. Comfort.<br>  <br>  It is your nerves that you must control, as they are the killers of the pleasure of kissing. When you're worried about the result of a kiss, won't enjoy the moment like you could and should. Relaxation is key!<br>  <br>  3. Forget about everything.<br>  <br>  Relaxation, finding a comfortable position and clear heads are important. I tell you, you will never really enjoy kissing in a car or in a crowded place, where either the comfortable position or the intimacy is missing.<br>  <br>  4. Imagination.<br>  <br>  Very important. Great kissers adapt to their partner and try different kinds of kisses. If your kissing inventory has only two styles - a normal kiss with closed lips and the famous French kiss -it may be high time to discover other possibilities. Be imaginative and inventive.<br>  <br>  5. Rhythm.<br>  <br>  Start the kiss gently, then become greedy, finally allow a break for breathing and catching his or her eyes. Remember, kissing is sometimes called a "dance of the lips" and every dance should have a rhythm!|`|41519dcd613e198147ae134a0f6e6e78aa	It can best be shown than explained in  words !|`|d5c7ca66e3aab5e96442c48cd1fde13aaa	spread a spoonful of honey on your gf's lips or cheeks<br>  kiss it, u r sure to get a sweet kiss|`|JetaJF6Maa	its not a method to how to do it <br>  but if u want to do it  nd do it wen ur really prepared <br>  just go close to him/her nd the filling just come within u nd u kiss thats all|`|7kF26l4jaa	(no tongue)<br>  all lips<br>  the best kind<br>  <br>  step one<br>  look into eyes<br>  step two<br>  lean foward<br>  step three<br>  go like 90% and then go slowly and kiss<br>  simple|`|AFGxrXSyaa	suck on his or her finger.|`|vRXtz76Iaa	A sweet kiss?

TIVrZ2I8aa	I know it's hard but....you are going to have to "hold on loosely but don't let go".<br>  <br>  Try telling him how you truly feel about him.  His gf is new so there shouldn't be too much trouble if he chooses to be with you.  I hope you don't just want him now cuz he has someone else to take up his time and energy?!?

It's not an everyday thing that a guy say's that to you. Even if you 2 did date & thing's didn't work you can still keep a good friend ship with him. You should call him & tell him how you feel. Dont be scared, the worse thing he can tell you is no but even if he does you can still be friend's & there's nothing wrong with that. You have nothing to lose tellin him how you feel & in the end it might be worth it. You just have to decide if your willing to take thing's all the way.|`|djUMvICoaa	Sex ruins more friendships than anything.  But when you're not ready for it it is even worse.  But I don't know how this guy could do what he did after a 3 to 4 year friendship.  That is strange, but at your age it may be that he felt he was ready to move on, he had some conquest under his belt that will help him with his next one.  I'm sorry you had to be betrayed like that.  But him jumping from one relationship to another doesn't say a lot about him anyway, I think there's another girl that's going to get hurt.  You may be better off without him even if it seems pretty lonely now.  You will get over him in time, someone will come along and when he does you'll make some better choices.  Best of luck to you.
1JtnI4SEaa	How old are you guys? Chances are she is still trying to find herself and her own personal style, so in the meantime she mimics you and your friends. Help her find her own style. When you go shopping point out things that would look cute on her and urge her to buy them. She will eventually stop copying your style once she feels comfortable with her own. In the meantime, you should feel flattered that she would chose you to copy...it must mean that she really admires you.|`|ktDZjbH7aa	HONEY IF U DONT WANT TO TELL HER TO HER FACE,,WRITE HER A NICE NOTE OR TEX HER,,AND SHES PROB ONLY COPYING YOU CAUSE SHE REALLY ADMIRES YOUR TASTE,,,JUST BE NICE AND TELL HER SHE NEEDS TO FIND HER OWN LOOK,,,BUYT JUST REMEMBER,,SHE MUST LIKE U ALOT TO WANT TO BE LIKE U,,,,PEACE
am7Ykwqiaa	Obviously his libido is placing strain upon your relationship. If you feel that you're being taken advantage of, you probably are. You've done the right thing and talked with him about how you feel. If he hasn't shown you any understanding and you're still feeling pressured, maybe you need to consider separating.

Besides you said yourself often times you don't see him for days, imagine if he was there & how worn our you would be if he wanted it each & every day, 2 to 3 times a day.  Just be glad he's still attracted to you sexually & that he has a libido like a rabbit, several years from now you'll be back on YA asking what to do about his sex drive as he only wants sex once a week.  Either way you'd still be complaining, had it turned out that his sex drive was slow you probably wouldn't like it either because than he wouldn't be giving it to you as much.  Take advantage of it while it last, as he ages it will decrease & you'll wish it hadn't.

k3DdIDGoaa	Well to me, this girl sounds like shes only interested for fun, and you did say you didn't like her a lot so i assume u like her and at the same time you don't like her that much. If you want to get her out of ur system,then i pefer u just try to not make contact with her, this involves no eye contact or even knowing shes there. This should help you lose slight interest in her. Or if this doesn't help and you really like her then you should say hi to her often (note that if you don't wats the point of this then), play hard to get, everytime shes near you just walk away from her, making her want to see you even more, also you said something about her friends not liking guys, maybe her friends are not interested or not attracted to guys making her the same, this should be a reason to get her out of your system before she attempts to embarrass you :O|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	huh?|`|SBXmPn9saa	No...please throw it away that ugly feelings,you know it will only make things harder for you when you keep thinking to be dead.

It seems like she wants to be with her boyfriend and not you (sorry). I think chatting and talking on the phone are different things btw. I think she just wants to you to be a close friend with her.<br>  so if you really like her i suggest wait il she breaks up with him.|`|W2rCKPbBaa	shes got 2 guys at a tym...or maybe she wants u to be her friend nd disagrees that chattin and talkin on phone is one and the same thing..chattin must be much easier for her without gettin her boyfriend's feelngs hurt..maybe not talkin to you is worse dan upsettin hr boyfriend|`|Ri4NUuLtaa	thanks for answering my question, so I'll answer yours. And this is just my opinion.<br>  <br>  I think she's just confused, so she's maybe blocking out her feelings. If you ever get to see her with her bf, see how she acts around him, without being too noticeable that you're staring. If she acts kind of shy, maybe she's still thinking about her feelings. If she only says yes every time the bf asks her something, then that also means she's thinking. Does she talk about her problems with you more than her own boyfriend? All I'm trying to say is that she probably is still unclear and is confused, so don't pressure her. And if you have your gut telling you she likes you, then you probably do have a chance. But just wait patiently and if she needs comfort, be there for her like a friend if she doesn't accept you. <br>  There is always other fish in the sea ;) <br>  and this is just a silly side note, but we female can be weird at times, but sometimes, it's your test ;)

It's not real love, they say. Puppy Love, they call it. Those people, I think, have very short memories, and no longer recall the realities of their first love experiences. While few expect teen love to last a lifetime, that hardly makes it less real. Half or more of all adult love doesn't last a lifetime either. <br>  <br>  Teen love is very real. And powerful.

Clck489haa	Honestly-if he keeps up his player ways, your relationship just won't work. It doesnt seem like he really loves you or respects you if he continues to meet girls and knows it makes you uncomfortable. Talk about it with him and think about it...its your decision in the end. Best of luck!|`|2f7214f6ad7889e2dcde8b7609919286aa	Once a cheat always a cheat you said it yourself he is not willing to give up his player ways not even for you. Let him go. You will find a man that honors and cherishes you and wants to make you happy. There is nothing wrong with guys having girls at friends but to be so insecure to feed off of such things is not good. He moved on after 3weeks come on your better than that...|`|b8QM7NY6aa	Don't  please, if he's such a chick magnet it's obvious he's a player, don't let the i love yous' cloud your womanly insticnt even though it's hard to let them go and we all know it is ladies, it's for the best for both our mental and spiritual health. ;)|`|2sBzrxxfaa	Well there, a famous Quote: Once a Cheater always a Cheater!<br>  <br>  You need to move past him, if he was able to find someone within a few weeks after breaking it off with you. What is there to say that he would not do it again, and again, and again......<br>  <br>  You need to find someone that you respect and that respect you! Try this little experiment, go out with him again. If you catch him "eyeing" other girls than tell him to his face that he could never change and walk away.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and I hope you Find that special person!
lvOR401haa	Awww honey - are you ok?<br>  <br>  10 weeks is nothing - don't pressure yourself into losing the weight so fast.  Celebrities and their size 0-ness like 5 minutes after birth have a lot to answer for *grrr*.<br>  <br>  Is there any chance you're suffering baby blues?  That could explain the way you feel.  I don't know how you felt before you had the baby about yourself - so it may be a longer term feeling.<br>  <br>  Either way, talk to the nurse next time she is over and ask her advice on Post Natal Depression and who to speak to about it.<br>  <br>  You have a man who is with you, a beautiful (I have no doubt) son - that's the important thing here.<br>  <br>  Give yourself some time to lose weight and keep check on how you are feeling to see if it gets worse.  All the best - hugs
cQiNs0yRaa	how will she get to know you better<br>  if you don't hang out even a bit?<br>  there are two options<br>  . either you need to be patient and see how things go<br>  . or you can invite her out but not as  a date, more like maybe go for lunch sometime or go for a drink as friends<br>  <br>  and there are two possibilities<br>  . either she does like you but is shy and reserved<br>  . or she doesn't like you and is afraid to tell you<br>    and really just wants to be friends<br>  <br>  you need to give us some more information<br>  about her overall behavior when she's around you.|`|fnBPI4OAaa	Well you already have your answer, get to know her better.|`|8mHRTQmPaa	If she likes you she will smile a lot, laugh, tease you playfully, hit and touch you all in fun though.|`|1b9b2144f2dfcbf2ab89c159c0722b98aa	She doesn't like you, but keep trying anyway.

He is my best friend and knows all there is to know about me.<br>  <br>  I didnt want love when I met him by the way, I was just after friendship.

This is the stupidest question I've come across on YA! LOL!<br>  <br>  Of course not!!! Do you even know what S-L-U-T means? I will define it anyway, it means a person that would sleep around just for sex with as many boys as possible (also known as slapper, tart, slag etc.) lol. A virrrgin means that you HAVE NOT had sex. So what if you haven't? Maybe you don't want to loose your virginity over some toss pot w*nker that treats you like sh*t? I bloody don't, I waited for mister right and found him. <br>  <br>  My point is don't believe what everyone tells you.

You obviously wouldn't (if your clever).|`|CrZxYK5raa	No your a better  person if your a virgin.<br>  you don't want to be a slut. guys might<br>  not be to happy that your not going to just <br>  give into what ever they want. but that is a<br>  good respect. you have to respect yourself <br>  if you want a man to.|`|rpsQMsl4aa	thats the most retarded thing ive ever heard...your school is wack... their probably saying that so it would be easier for the guys to get laid...|`|3FUzRANPaa	Probably because you don't enjot the feeling of sex<br>  <br>  Ps what are you|`|8Loq9Skraa	The girls that are saying that are slvts!

And who the heck comes on Yahoo Answers to brag about being a fake model anyway? Get over yourself and go back to your trailer.|`|Ml3PLvzWaa	Maybe he is trying to make you understand how he feels by showing you.

Your in a relationship, but having an emotional connection with him.<br>  <br>  you're obviously not into your boyfriend.  life is too short, jump ship and be single.  date this other guy since your so curious

YjUztskvaa	he must liked the other girl more than you that's why he picked her. stop sulking, just get a move on.|`|qy07K2k5aa	I think you should wait and see how him and that girl are getting on first, then make a relevant decision. For example, if they're getting along really well, then you know you're out of the race, but if they can't really get along in that sense, you stand a chance.|`|Mrg4DpK1aa	its just one of those things that happens, while you were just waiting on him to make a move another girl was a little more brave and asked him out herself, next time try to stand up and ask the guy.

eS63CfSLaa	Hi Mac,<br>  <br>  I really can't say that I have insight to what is going through this girl's mind. I'll just ask a few questions first?<br>  <br>  1- Did you 'over' text her to begin with?<br>  2- Did you 'over' compliment her? Tell her that she is beautiful, amazing, you've never met anyone like her etc etc.<br>  3- Is she VGL (very good looking)?<br>  <br>  If you have answered yes to any of the above, this is probably what is happening. Taking into consideration the fact that she recently came out of a bad relationship, she is probably feeling just a bit overwhelmed by all the attention. Don't get me wrong, girls love attention, though occasionally even complimentary attention can feel like a bit too much. She probably doesn't trust you. She also probably thinks that you are being disingenuous. So back off with the compliments, for the time being. If she is VGL then she is used to being told that she is hot- why should you be any different from all the other guys?<br>  <br>  If her ex never complimented her or was abusive (passive/ active), she is probably feeling very insecure at the moment.I'm trying to read through the lines- she mentions that "her flaws will push you away". She might also feel that she was the reason for her previous relationship ending, or even that she made him treat her badly. Blame is a heavy burden to carry around.<br>  <br>  All I can advice is that if you really want to have a relationship with this girl:<br>  1- give her space, be patient (good things come to those who wait)<br>  2- don't ask questions (she will talk when she is good & ready. Take heart in the fact that she is telling you what she thinks the problems are)<br>  3- be honest & open (trust is earned) <br>  4- be yourself (girls can tell when you are putting on a show)<br>  <br>  I hope this helps. All the best.<br>  <br>  Love & Blessings<br>  <br>  x|`|AA10720869	Maybe she's not ready, and haven't moved on yet. Did she show any interest in you ? Most of the time, these phrases sound like excuses. And i, personally, tend to use them to try to explain that i'm not interested. I don't know if that's the case with you guys... but just bear in mind. Good Luck!|`|JrWWvnMBaa	She sounds insecure so just be really relaxed with and around her and dont put any pressure on by not asking her out for a while.|`|FGMDbhoJaa	She sounds insecure don't bother yourself with her.|`|p1eAG1qJaa	well..she says her ex-boyfriend was an asshole..then it means she is still thinking of him..in a way..does she scold him often?if so..she is definately not over him.try asking her again.|`|VUV5fFhEaa	she is insecure... leave her alone, let her live her life. and get your own. <br>  *not being rude*|`|80aDsO21aa	Well, to be honest with you whenever I'm talking in person or through texts I will flirt and sometimes whenever the guy admits to me he likes me or wants to try to move things further I quit talking to them much and barely text them or avoid them if I see them somewhere and I do bring up how my flaws are horrible which I do think so but if that pushes him away then it's a win for me. So maybe she either wants to be single and be able to flirt around since she got out of a relationship.|`|sedCwxOsaa	she started doubting herself it sounds like and hasn't stopped<br>  self-deprecation is sign of a poor self-image<br>  I had a poor self-image and I'd think I was fat when I was skinny<br>  small and stringy when I'm 6' 200 lbs<br>  It doesn't make a lot of sense<br>  but then again it doesn't have to, it's how I felt<br>  I got through some it just by confronting the falsity<br>  talk too much,"You've haven't told me your favorite color, how am I going to get that out of you if you clam up now"<br>  I'm fat, "Give me more hugs"<br>  I'm skinny, "give me more hugs"<br>  I can't, "but you do and I want more from you"|`|AA11441704	You need to talk to her.......|`|QU37MZi7aa	not all women can easily find a new BF after the break up of the previous one and can't even forget the past, so as to mention those asshole words... etc. etc. even myself that i was over with my EX few years ago, i still can't barely control saying dirty words like he was only a gimp w4nker if i find something fishy with my new one. which is making a signal that he could be like him too. and not because of insecurity also. feelings and emotions do differ from each other, so as to differ also on the time when s/he can fully forget the past and facing the new one this time without bothering him/herself thinking the previous asshole! lol.|`|YjUztskvaa	you're just wasting your time on her.<br>  she's obviously not really into, she just enjoy the attention.<br>  find a girl who makes sense and doesn't make things complicated.|`|Tb5OoHrQaa	does she still talk about him a lot?....if she does then shes definitly not over him<br>  <br>  as for how shes acting...shes either puttin on a show to avoid you....or shes insecure.|`|AA10706358	Look I won't say much but here is something I am 100% sure about :<br>  <br>  MOVE ON !|`|nISWmpq2aa	I think she is a type who likes to be in company of many but is not ready 4 accepting the truth. She lets her heart sweep high first but when it comes over a decision she lets her mind take all the control.<br>  i think this might have troubled her ex. But as a girl she might have tangeled with her decision and again tried to make a contact with him.<br>  cos if she hated him so why would she be talking of while being with u??? I think she is a complexed and confused girl whose not fixed on her decisions. Even if ur linkups move on further there might be many mishaps. So my advice would be to leave her and have a fastrack life on , provided u do like peaceful life without tensions.<br>  Best wishes.<br>  May God Help U Takin Thr Right Decision<br>  Reva

It is for procreation, not for recreation. And that's a common mistake of persons. It is in the Bible that one can only have that if she/he is already married. Reserved your virginity to your husband! Be a sacred living. Do what is right for you not doing what others are doing.

Don't say or do anything that will hurt her feelings, because you should "never burn your bridges".  Find someone else and ask them to be your partner before she has a chance to ask.<br>  <br>  Another thought-tell her you would rather not be her partner, because you just do not compliment each other, that you can't put it into words, but you would rather not.  Be vague, that you don't understand why, but finding other partners would be better for you both.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	You must be blunt and to the point saying you do not feel working together will be beneficial to you both or the project.<br>  If she freaks out then stick to what you have said and walk away.|`|VhrUtQc2aa	I would go up to her and tell her i would like to talk to you,<br>  take her to the side and tell her that you like her as a friend but I cannot work with you any more because you freak out over everything and i am not comfortable with that.<br>  <br>  And Maybe tell her about her giggle when you were interviewing someone and how uncool that was to you and unacceptable.

28d07970c3adc9d81a00eeb71a258aa1aa	Infatuation is a foolish or all-absorbing passion. It's almost just the same with crush.  You are just probably physically attracted to someone or amazed by his/her intelligence. It's just in the surface.The crush however is a simple, non-threatening way to like something about someone. It's short. Crush lasts shorter than infatuation. You may have hundreds of crushes or infatuations. There are no difference at all.|`|HQp1MGgvaa	i would say a crush is someone that you feel warm fuzzy feelings for, you can talk to them, see them out with other people. have fantasies about them. <br>  <br>  infatuation is when you can't stop thinking about him/her. you don't want them with anyone else but you. in one word....obsessive. Could land you in jail.
IcXmZc6saa	look, first of all,all  boys and girls are really different in their natures,tastes,likes and dislikes.and if they have all these things very common then they usually turn out to be very good frends but not lovers.friendship is very good in a love relationship,but if u treat her like one of the those of your guy friends then their are very few chances of getting her heart.and moreover be a little romantic,use sense of humour and show sensibility,she will definitely fall for u.and if u hang with her just to make friendship with her  then its ok to hang with her like one of ur guy friends...<br>  its not a bad thing....but dont do and say all the rubbish and bad things with a girl that u boys discuss with each other...there are some topics which should be left out with a girl..watch out for all those.|`|9LMLhypVaa	from a girl stand point...<br>  i kinda like it when my bf treats me differently around his friends...like normal lol. but then there's other times i don't mind. just be sure to make sure she knows that you think she's special when both of you are hanging out with your guy friends...telling her she looks cute or something sweet is is always good =)<br>  <br>  good luck =)|`|Zj9pycyUaa	very very very bad she will start getting offended thinking you think shes just one of the guys|`|w7CtbbQdaa	does she like it?  that's the only important thing.  ask her.|`|txax0vQ3aa	Hey dog, i think u made a big mistake, ur Gf must be above any friend, u gotta treat her like a princess, u know what i'm sain' big dog??Try and be more gentle...|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	you should be asking her.|`|UJJ8ObnXaa	You should probably ask her, but i think that most girls like being treated special.
6jhDL35Gaa	You should ask yourself this question.<br>  Why should I have to explain anything to my EX boyfriend? If we are over, and it is over, I don't have to explain anything to him because he's a non-factor in this or whatever else I have to do in my life! What you did with this other guy is between you and this OTHER guy. Not your ex. He was the rebound guy and it was good for your soul at the time. Now you are still having regret over it. Your ex bf is still your ex and that won't change. Concentrate on yourself getting better emotionally then make an attempt to go out and find someone new. Stop trying to be promiscuous and focus!|`|c99a5407fb7bfb892111f9e9314b6dcaaa	forget about both guys. work on yourself. you need some serious self esteem.|`|TtMKPBR3aa	how can anyone understand what you did when you can't even figure it out

Be the person who has big heart
JvbvGtrBaa	u should just tell him you have a crush on him. <br>  that you want date him <br>  if hes not feeling the vibe or coming on as strong i don't suggest persuing him, it's going to break your heart to look at him at school. u might as well get over him and date someone else. <br>  but if all goes well hes just as interested if not more then go for commitment.|`|k3DdIDGoaa	You know guys these days, they could be doing this for fun, but maybe replying him while he's offline isn't the best way to talk, cause you have to wait like a day til he replies or something. Also you should try telling him why he hasn't been sending you messages or just ask him if he has been on msn lately to reply to those comments.|`|1b9b2144f2dfcbf2ab89c159c0722b98aa	you should keep being persistent and clingy. guys like that. also add in a bit of stalking.|`|kynzqmWgaa	maybe he's busy.
1b9b2144f2dfcbf2ab89c159c0722b98aa	Probably because he doesn't think you like him so he's trying to find another girl instead.

You know with marriage everything changes when you get used to someone especially when you know that this is same person you are always with every time. May be he is facing some problems like work is stressing him and he comes back home tired. the best thing to do is to ask him and get the right answer from him also study him and know his moods. Express your feeling about the whole issue.|`|pP5xDLkhaa	NOT REALLY BUT     *  Simply take one organ in each hand, and squeeze, gently at first, then harder & harder until he gasps and make a high-pitched whimpering noise. At this point he will tell you absolutely anything you want to know, no matter how incriminating, in order to stop the extreme pain that he will be experiencing! I've used this technique a few times, and its absolutely infallible!<br>  <br>  <br>  LOL|`|lPXscuKSaa	No man is going to answer this question honestly. Some will be flippant and others will make jokes but the truth is that it is a secret man thing and not for women to know.

They really do feel emptier after he "finished". hahaha <br>  It doesn't necessarily mean that your man has been cheating but it could mean he had masturbated and wasn't honest... My ex's would always feel like that right after the shower.... I definitely know he didn't have a girl in there with him. LOL<br>  Good Luck!|`|hpuJBcasaa	When i haven't had it for a while my balls just swell up and go massive as they are filling up with love juices. <br>  I would suggest touching him up and feeling to see if they are growing bigger, if they are like footballs then you are ok, if they are like pea's you might have a problem.|`|fWBLCPX2aa	You can not tell by any private part that your husband is cheating unless you catch him.

Mqee6u8jaa	after about a year yeah they say it's normal for you to argue more because your afraid that you'll become bored with each other and someone will leave, they say once you hit the 3 year mark your pretty much good. but you guys are probably arguing because you can't trust each other. <br>  <br>  i'm gonna assume that you guys spend quite a lot of time together because that's normally how it is. what you need to do is Exactly the opposite spend more time apart so that you can appreciate each other more when the other is  not around. and you'll learn to trust one another because you really have no Choice but to trust since either of you will be around to see what the other is doing.<br>  <br>  i've recently have been through this we use to hang out a lot and would argue about things that dealt with jealousy. but now we take some time to do other things rather then be with each other, which makes us realize just how great it is to have that person around. then the trust starts to built because you realize that when he's not with you he didn't do anything to hurt you and he really does care for you.|`|6uRYYQz6aa	Well, me and my boyfriend were EXACTLY the same as this. <br>   Until one day, we broke up.

But its not over silly things anymore.|`|noX4xlvKaa	You might be spending too much time together have some space so then you cant fight then when you see each other again once you've had some time to yourselves, you wont fight because you've missed each other.|`|UTxt6tOGaa	Its impossible for 2 people to spend a lot of time together and not clash at some point,<br>  <br>  If your arguing over silly things and the jealousy isnt nessacary then maybe you need to think about whether you really are gonna be together forever.

WzKrZoHQaa	You are what is classed as "Vulnerable" in yr state.  You must call the Council now and ask to speak with Emergency Housing Dept.  If the house is in joint names then it will be difficult.  He could be helping yr cause if he evicts you - but even an eviction notice has a legal 2 months notice so he can't just chuck you out onto the pavement girl - you have rights too - more so as you are looking after a toddler and are pregnant as it is.  You will need to take yrs and baby birth certificate and any proof of income - even if he claims money for you on benfir you will need to know how it is paid.  They are very helpful but they will help.  Good luck Hun.  Maybe continuing with the pregnancy is not a good option - consider speaking with Brook Advisory service OR if you are between 13-19yrs old call Connexions centre in yr area they have all these answers too.|`|AA11996507	And you would ask this question of a bunch of strangers on the internet instead of your local council person in charge of housing because.....?|`|hfr9rLjkaa	Yeah if you have split up and can prove you have no where else to go they will house you in a hostel until they find you a house for a more permanent basis...Good Luck! xx|`|lIO4uiJmaa	The Council has to rehouse you , but you will have to take what you are offered, which might not be very nice or good accommodation or in an area you want to live in.<br>  <br>  Your ex has no rights to continue to support you as you are not married, but he has to support the baby when it is born.|`|BEqAhXBlaa	you will go onto the housing list if he evicts you which means you will end up in a grotty B&B until you get to the top of the list|`|BELH7wtxaa	add me and let chat , let me chance to reply ur question in peronally <br>  <br>  modern_fashion_london_2002@yahoo.com

I mean i dont understand y u would even consider being with him if he is so ugly to u and that is such a problem.<br>  <br>  but i will ask u this would u rather have a good looking guy that doesnt treat you right or an ugly one that does anything to make u happy.|`|sARTaNLNaa	see he is your boyfriend you love him the way he is, and moreover what really matters is how he feel about you..how he loves you and how much do you love him...i dont think looks really matter when you are really in love with someone!|`|vuRejUo3aa	You should feel shame uttering the word "ugly" regarding boyfriend. He can't be 'sweet'(!) to you because to understand sweetness one needs a highly open, broad mind & heart. It would be nice for him if he could quit you being intelligent on time.|`|6iLDFgj2aa	It's not about looks, it's about personality.<br>  Many girls spend ages looking for the right man but once they have found him, their not grateful for what they have.<br>  He loves you so you should love him.|`|1MLBtDDcaa	You obviously dont appreciate him if you would consider breaking up with him because he is ugly.<br>  Dont be so shallow.|`|ff821ce78a4a75250794e181494a8cf9aa	Seriously, who cares that your man is ugly??

It's only fair to him to let him find a girl that IS attracted to him.|`|0PsnnVb6aa	wat exactly do you mean by ugly??? if you like him nd accept him as he is i think you should bring out his other qualities and make him feel good about himself...like his sweetness|`|AA10119142	I wonder if he knows what you are asking behind his back how he will look at you|`|nQix64Puaa	i go with eric, and why wud u even get in relationship with him if u cant get over his look thing?
cQiNs0yRaa	here is what i would do if i were you<br>  <br>  . tell her that you love her at least twice a day<br>    as many times as you can<br>    in a sincere and tender way<br>  <br>  . focus on her feelings ie making her feeling loved <br>    every day. she sounds like she needs support at this time.<br>    for women, support means mainly emotional support,<br>    they turn to food for comfort, and that's what she's been doing.<br>  <br>  . only when her emotional state is stable and beautiful<br>    will she start seeing herself and life in a more optimistic way<br>  <br>  . so you need to be a decisive factor for it<br>  <br>  . people  whou are  slow to get back up on their horse, aren't really<br>    lazy, sometimes they are simply too  sensitive and they need  time <br>    to  pull themselves together because things and feelings overwhelm <br>    them<br>  <br>  <br>  show her emotional  support<br>  be there for her emotionally<br>  try flowers, cards, kisses, sex , hugs, tenderness, <br>  focus on tenderness, that is my advice|`|YjUztskvaa	talk to her and tell her to fix her life if she wants to continue the relationship.  don't give in to her whims, tell her that you get stuck with someone who's got no goals and plans for the future.|`|XakZ3N1xaa	Find her a better BF who will support her instead of criticizing her.|`|rUhf56dwaa	Maybe she is depressed? Losing a job can knock at your confidence.

gWN7cZzmaa	don't rush it. everything will come when it comes. be patient you will get that kiss when you least expect it and its going to make you a happy girl.|`|tHFY2hg4aa	Your first kiss can be special yes. I will never forget mine. I think it is very possible that you could have a bad "first experience."<br>  Bottom line is, if you want your first kiss to be special, don't waste it on just anyone. However, that doesn't mean it has to be this guy you talk about. It's possible that there is another guy out there that will curl your toes.
0AYPgUQIaa	It's not unbelievable because you are not an innocent sweet pie, it is unbelievable because girl these days have sex at the age of 13-15. Some even earlier.<br>  So if guys hear about a 21 years old virgin, they are wondering how that is possible.<br>  Of course you are right to wait for the right person, but there is such a thing as "too choosy".<br>  Maybe there is a reason you didn't find the right person yet, and you shouldn't look for that reason in others but yourself.|`|AA11108018	No it is not difficult to believe your a virgin.  There are to many woman who are in such a hurry to lose it . It is refreshing to know there are still girls willing to hold on to it until they are married.

k9YaLawCaa	One sided love is very hard. It hurts really deeply and stays with you for years. I am late 20's and it has happened to me, you kinda get over it but, years later it still leaves a pit in your stomach when you think about it. The best thing is to accept it, take some things from it, like good memories and move on. You'll survive.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	one sided love is the worst thing ever in history. <br>  <br>  as charlie brown once said "nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter like unrequited love"|`|AA10408380	It sucks. It hurts, especially when the other one knows u love them, but they play with ur heart by acting like they love u, just to get what they want, and then they throw u away like a dirty rag once they're done with u.<br>  <br>  it's better not to fall in love, but once u do, it's wise to be careful. Be a guy but use ur feminine charms. Then u might be able to save urself from certain agony in the end.<br>  <br>  I know, guys go through this too, but u guys get over it faster, this is y girls get this advice|`|DVRSCYU1aa	Well ppl say dat its cheat bt ..rarely it may turn out to be gud ,coz may be u dont like d other bt d other loves u alot ,so dat does nt mean dat they wil cheat ,..cheating cums due to  misunderstanding ,lack of trust ,..and so on...........................|`|8oKazGVGaa	i think one sided love i crappy because they get what they can out of you an then cheat or just break up with you after they get that|`|AA11814313	I love the moving on thing do it if you can if not maybe when u r ready you will.  But only stay if their remorse for what they have done is more than your hurt.|`|GY30B5iZaa	HI,<br>  First of all your question talks about one sided love,and for me if love is one sided(and I am expecting it was from your side) then the question of  him cheating you doesn't come ,does it? Coz it was never love from his side in the first place.<br>  I know what it is to fall in love,and i also know what it is to love someone with all your heart and yet not get anything from that person in return,coz I myself have been through it , but its really important to be rooted to reality.And this my dear is a reality check.When you know that its one side,why cry over it?Does he care ,or better does he even know? No,right?Then why should you waste your tears .Have a control over your heart.And its important to move on,coz as they say,"there is no use crying over spilt milk".<br>  Gather yourself around,focus on your life,start living your life again.Its OK to mourn,and be upset but start your life again.You can do this by doing new things in life.Get a new hobby, network and socialise again,and you never know when you might meet someone interesting.<br>  Cheers!|`|AA10720869	Love isn't 'love' anymore if it's one sided. Second chances can be given only to those who didn't mean their actions. Cheating is not one of them. as Paramore says, "People never change". Cheaters will always be cheaters. I think you should slowly grasp that and move on....Good Luck.|`|hYZIYla0aa	It is not worth it,if you are not married, this is the time to go.No man is worth pitting up with that>All you need is for him to bring home a disease.Aids,HPV,gonorrhea,etc...|`|6sPsYqSYaa	Move on move on move on!!!<br>  <br>  Once a cheater always a cheater<br>  <br>  You can do way better<br>  <br>  x|`|nwHtQfd2aa	one-sided love is no love at all. the other person would always take benefits out of u. so just move on and find let this feeling be a past for u.|`|BgYP1h98aa	i feel i miss every thing in this world

You created this by ignoring a growing problem.<br>  <br>  Time to draw a line, but you need to be well informed, don't go off half ******.  <br>  <br>  But first, reduce his allowance, he gets 15% from now on, another 45% goes into your PERSONAL account, and the balance is spent on bills etc.  Any extra expenses come from his allowance, and your account, 50/50.<br>  <br>  Tell him if he pisses you off, you are gonna turf him out on his ear.|`|8pup9oWhaa	I'm sorry but your husband sounds like a d!ck.

If your in the UK this wouldnt be much of a problem for most bosses, but if your in the USA, i wouldnt know, but movies sure make out that you've got no leyway at work!.<br>  Also, do you have a family member you can stay with?

If you want him to dance, you have to change the steps, because he isn't going to. <br>  Try going to counselling on your own, to get some practical advice on how to get your marriage back on track. <br>  <br>  If mum and dad aren't helpful, find someone who is. Make friends with other mums, or try going to church, it's like a wonderful big family in the one I attend.

Boy...you are stuck with a lazy pig ignorant man aren't you.<br>  <br>  The advice is simple I'm afraid and you have already touched on it - you need to lay down the law and be strong enough to say enough is enough and move on.<br>  <br>  Sorry but..he has had it to easy for far too long and you are allowing him to do it and get away with it.<br>  <br>  The bottom line here is - he will not change now.<br>  <br>  Only YOU can decide here - put up with it or move on and get out. What you have on your hands is abuse - he is abusing you without any scars - mental abuse is just as bad and just as tiring and hard to fight.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Aww he sounds like a selfish pig.  Sorry but if he wants money to buy the things he wants then he should get himself a part time job.  <br>  <br>  Set up a bank account for the children and get the child benefit paid in there.  That money can be used to pay for clothes for the kids as well as days out etc.<br>  <br>  You are the working parent so you are entitled to the tax credits and your wages.  Get a bank account only you have access to and get these things paid in there.<br>  <br>  Give your partner an allowance and he can spend this on what he wants.  Not a big one, just as much as you can afford after paying the bills etc and kept something for yourself.  <br>  <br>  He is not doing much in the grand scheme of things, basically sitting on his bum at home.  He doesn't do anything around the house, or think of taking you out anywhere.  He needs to learn to change and not take advantage of you.  <br>  <br>  Good luck x|`|lPXscuKSaa	Well you got that lot of your chest kid. You aint gonna change him you know that. Maybe for about five minutes but not for long. So what are you going to do? From the way that you talk no matter how he behaves you are going to stay with him cos you are to scared to be alone. As I am not emotionally involved I can tell you in black and white. Take the kids and start a new life. Women have been doing it for thousands of years. Tell a few porkies and go into a battered wifes home for a little while until they give you a home of your own. My sister did it and now she is as happy as can be. It's up to you.|`|y497a31Iaa	oh dear, stuck in a rut arent you<br>  <br>  he obviously doesnt appreciate anything that you do and takes you for granted in everyway possible.<br>  i think the best thing to do is to leave for a bit, is there anywhere you can stay like a relatives or friends? <br>  that might give him a wake up call as to what he would be losing if he doesnt buck his ideas up.  and if he doesnt change or is not bothered by your absence then im sorry but thats telling you something.<br>  <br>  i hope this works out for you, but if it doesnt then you are so better off without him anyway! but as kids are involved then i believe you should at least try to resolve it for their sakes first.<br>  <br>  Good Luck!
y4SUDnpaaa	I can give you an example. I was married 19 years and then divorced. We married two young, I was 18 and he was 22, and we just grew apart. but he's a good man and the father of our two daughters. I still and always will love him because of the time we spent together, the kind of man he is and because he gave me 2 wonderful children. I love him like a brother or old friend. On the other hand I remarried and am totally in love with my husband. There are both love but worlds apart in what they mean.

When you walk in crowded areas, don't let your head sag, don't hunch over and don't let your eyes look straight down. Keep your head up, stand tall and look straight ahead. If you make eye contact with someone, smile or say hello... you don't have to stop and have a coversation with the, just keep walking.

Stop asking questions like this.  It kind of defeats the purpose doesn't it?<br>  2.  Get a map of your area. (Local only) Lay it down on the table.  Close your eyes and then just point to something on the map.  Where ever your finger lands is where you have to go.  When you get there, you have to talk to at least one person that lives in that area.  Keep a journal and record your journey, the person you met and what you talked about.  Every week end do this.  <br>  3.  Make a list of possible careers or jobs you are interested in. Call or go to a local business, such as a florist, and interview a person that works there and see what is all about.  <br>  4.  If you have a thrift store in town, go in and try on the most outrageous things you can find.  Pretend that you are an upcoming pop star and need to find your "look"  Take pictures. <br>  5.  If you have a garden center or shop in your town, go there once a week and buy a flower and plant it in your garden at home. Ask the people at the shop questions about the plants.<br>  6.  Take a karate class.  Self esteem galore. You will gain discipline and can kick some *&^ if you are ever assaulted.<br>  <br>  Any of these things will keep you busy, entertained and you will gain so much knowledge.  You get to know your town, the people that live there, and you will never be at a loss for words when someone asks you, "What did you do this week-end?"  Life is an adventure.

3e0IjGsYaa	I'm from a Christian background, so my answer will most likely be different from some of the rest. I'm not sure how old you are, but a young lady should always dress in a way that reflects that she has respect for herself, and in a way that shows the guy you demand respect from him.<br>  <br>  What I'm trying to relay here, is that, if you dress in a way that's showing off your body, ex: too much skin showing, low v-neck shirts showing off your chest area too much, etc., the guy may think the wrong things about you. Whereas, dressing ladylike, where you hide the things that make him only wonder, will make the "nice guys" flock your way, vs. just the ones out for a piece! Does that make sense?<br>  <br>  Now, this is not to say that if you DO dress inappropriately, that guys aren't going to show you attention...but in the long run, it's gonna be the wrong kind of attention that you're seeking...and in turn, may hurt you worse in the long run.<br>  <br>  As a young lady, you should make a guy try to imagine what you look like, and in turn, it can make a guy want you that much more. <br>  <br>  As far as how to get one: just be yourself. learn to love yourself first, and then you're able to love others. have confidence in yourself...guys notice this in women - they are attracted to it. Of course, there are men out there that notice that your confidence isn't too high - these men may do one of two things: 1) Not show interest in a relationship and run the other way -or- 2) Show interest in you, but for the wrong reasons. The guy that does this should be a sign to you that he's not looking for anything more but a good time...he will most likely use you for what he desires, and afterwards throw you aside! Remember, guys in this position will tell you EVERYTHING that you long to hear just to get their way. If you should meet one of these types, the only advice I have for you is to: Run, Run far far away! ;)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|djUMvICoaa	Are you trying to get a boyfriend or trap one?  Don't dress any way you haven't before.  You should never lose yourself trying to get a man.  Be yourself, be friendly, be honest, and be caring.  But don't give up who you are to be with a man.  It may take a little longer before Mr. Wright comes along, but that's the good thing, he will come along and you don't have to settle for Mr. Right Now.  A pleasant smile and a nice laugh will be all you will ever need to attract the right kind of guy.  The ones who go after how you dress scare me, they are usually skirt chasers, and you don't need one ot them.  good luck|`|aSx2kEb8aa	i have the same question cee<br>  <br>  how can i get a girlfriend<br>  <br>  im 21 but still have no girlfriend<br>  <br>  hope i can get to know u well<br>  <br>  email me|`|7ff91aea1d5f9f19f507ddbc78ae0251aa	maybe if you get off of the computer and live life that would help|`|oQEqF4alaa	Well basically your saying you just want one and wont care about him unless you have one. But if you really want one you have to like them like if they go to school and you like that guy talk to him and maybe he might have feeling for you to, but you have to make sure he is giving you signs of "i like you". like if he wants to hang out(sometimes means just as friends) or go on a date or even if he keeps talking to you.|`|eXSy6IwMaa	just be YOURSELF!  never act of who you are not. because, guys would love girls who are what they are! be friendly. talk w/ guys not only w/ girls.. <br>  <br>  honestly, i do feel the same way too.. my friend say that, maybe i should be the one to do the first step.. [ you know what i mean? ]<br>  <br>  i mean, ask the guy that like out or open up a conversation w/ him. then, impress him. by your ownself.. never use methods of someone else.. use your own.. and, there will be a possibility that, you'll win his heart and he'll confess to you later on.! ehehhe... :D|`|n8Gmn4Puaa	Hi.

Or you WILL lose him.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	No one of any intelligence would suggest an OTC drug in lieu of seeing a doctor...<br>  <br>  I think you should stop thinking about and investigating sexual solutions and start thinking about and investigating relationships and emotional commitments.  Marriages take work and sex is the barometer.  When you're having trouble with this, especially as a woman, it is a signal that all is not right in the relationship...<br>  <br>  Look for non sexual solutions.  Non-sexual body massage.  Holding hands and talking on the couch.  Eye contact without words.  Take off the pressure, sex should come naturally.<br>  <br>  Your husband's complaints about your "libido" tells me your husband is being self-centered and thinks you're some kind of sex toy for him.  He has a responsibility to you emotionally, but whether he is old enough and mature enough to realize it is another story.|`|wzqahEqiaa	Check out Natural Family Planning.

Maintain a diet that is high in B vitamins (or take a B-complex supplement) and zinc and magnesium. These are crucial for your sex drive. Get plenty of exercise. The endorphins that are released when you exercise not only make you feel good but also boost your sex drive. If you can afford it, puchase some progestorone cream (runs about $40 and available online and in health food stores) this is a hormone that your body should be producing naturally but is often lacking. Follow the directions to the letter. At your age you would use it only two weeks out of the month.<br>  <br>  Also find something that stimulates your sexuality mentally. Now this is very individual. For some it would be porn, for others historical romances, for others reading erotica. Sex starts in the brain so implant the ideas! <br>  <br>  Hopefully these suggestions help.|`|UUtTDAJraa	The first thing you need to do is figure out why your sex drive is low and try to help get it back.  I was in your situation and it's not fun without being horny and feeling in the mood when needed.  I also felt like my orgasms (if I would even get one) were really weak.  Probably because of my sex drive.<br>  <br>  However, I tried exercising and dieting but nothing seemed to be working.  I thought I was screwed.  I then found something just as amazing as the vibrator.<br>  <br>  My friend at work told me about this stuff she took to raise her sex drive.  It was a natural herbal supplement and was I lucky to of found it.  Theres no side effects and the sex drive is just tremendous along with orgasms that are blasting.  The stuff is called Hersolution pills.  At the time I saved money on them at herenhancement.com<br>  <br>  What I did was tried out for 3 months and that was really it.  I found taking them every other day or so was the best to stretch it out. After the months were up, I was back to normal with a beating sex drive and my orgasm strength in increased so much.  <br>  <br>  Well good luck and I hope this helps.|`|IqBCEEckaa	i understand you don't have money for a doctor, but it doesn't cost anything to call and ask them your question.

Although it is effective, I would not recommend it.  <br>  <br>  Everyone's body is different and even if all signs say it is "safe" it may really not be.  Also women tend to have a cycle for their sex drive and for most women their highest peak would be around the time of ovulation.  This is no surprise since it is natural for our bodies to be pregnant...this is just mother nature's way of trying to ensure reproduction.  I know that at least for me, by the time we can have sex again, my drive is totally gone.  <br>  <br>  Since NFP is the only method we can use at this time I am not trying to convince you that it does not work.  I just want anyone who is considering this option to realize it is not as easy as the website or even the NFP "instructors" say it is.|`|FzFSzilmaa	sex IS a big part of an adult relationship... there are many factors (including drugs) to affect libido..<br>  <br>  some people find that alcohol helps make things better... or there is something called HORNY GOAT WEED (from most health food shops) that work on men AND women...<br>  <br>  you could also try exercise.. swimming, martial arts, etc... that gets the body working properly...<br>  <br>  or your husband could try lots of foreplay on you... or erotic massage..
d7TV40xfaa	They may not be the promise ring that you are thinking of. <br>  I have promise ring from my boyfriend, and it means that eventually i will get a real ring and get married someday, just not right now.<br>  <br>  The promise ring that he gave them, may be for purity. It is a ring that is a promise to stay a virgin until they are married. Some dads get them for their daughters sort of a reassurance.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	It sounds like he bought her a purity ring, meaning that she has promised that she won't have sex until she is married.  <br>  <br>  I personally find fathers buying these rings for their daughters creepy.  It's the daughter's body and her virginity.  The father cannot "purchase" or "control" it with jewelry.  If chastity until marriage is important to the daughter, then she will make the commitment to herself.  Otherwise it just seems coercive.  Also, studies show that most adolescents who take purity pledges still have sex before marriage and, when they do, they are more likely to have unprotected sex.  Thus, putting themselves at risk for pregnancy and STDs, including HIV.|`|45ca9f20886ed179a7577d9c3b53a67faa	To promise she will not have sex  before marriage I would imagine.|`|03n14OLLaa	A promise ring is simply a symbol to remind her how important it is not to have sex until she is married.

You can try to talk to the parent you are closest to and just tell them you are noticing they are having some problems and express your feelings.<br>  I know you don't want them to split up.

You are beautiful!<br>  <br>  The way to get guys to like you is to be yourself.  I know that sounds so cliche, but it's soooo true.  Guys can sense insecurity from a mile away.  When we aren't being ourselves, we come across as being indecisive, CLINGY (they HATE this!), immature, easy to manipulate, and too easy to "catch."<br>  <br>  The best way to get them to like you is to be confident.

Just stand up straight, be genuine to people, smile a lot, and have a good time!<br>  <br>  I wouldn't worry at all if I were you!  ;-)|`|58624ad5fd2dd57e6a4e665efe1fee92aa	Your face and body are fine with me.

Paris Hilton does it...and look how popular she is.<br>  <br>  2) This is your best choice.  BE YOURSELF!  you are a beautiful girl! And if you really want to be the "cool one" don't be afraid to make people laugh! be your normal goofy self and let go!  <br>  <br>  I have been there.  Trust me.  I am 22, and am now with the man of my dreams.  But i was once that girl who wanted to fit in.  I tried it all.  the "shy and flirty girl," the "look at me, look at me, giggle bit*h," even the "i wear black because it reflects my inner turmoil goth girl."  NONE of those worked.  So i went back to my jeans and t-shirts, and being the "fat kid" (because unlike you i am a big girl) that made everyone laugh.  You will just be the skinny kid that makes everyone laugh.<br>  <br>  Most girls think i am insane when i say this.  but please just be yourself.  I beg you, don't let boys and society change who you are.|`|xTD6XWffaa	just be who you really are and please do not swear or even try to be a ****** to get attention have a great personality and always paste a big smile on your face even if u dont feel happy it shows boys u are very nice and approachable  <br>  and plz do not go for looks but personality|`|phAqOpzZaa	I think your beautiful...no need to rush into things you cant just get a guy like that it takes time to get to know the guy...don't rush have fun w/your friends and enjoy your teen life as much as you can...god knows i wish i did...|`|I8uHjiw6aa	JESUS CHRIST<br>  YOUR BLOODY GORGEOUS?<br>  <br>  just wear a cute outfit,<br>  and guys like it when you hug them.<br>  (:|`|4beMwp92aa	yourrr so pretttty !

7096c009cbfa017c4e16a7e737f601dcaa	You don't have to make a big deal about it. Just keep on loving her as a friend and keep making it clear (in a loving way) that you are not interested in a sexual relationship with her. Good luck.|`|8PA58u3kaa	I You don't really have to do anything you haven't done already. If you've already stated that that is not the case and they still don't believe you, then like you said making a big deal out of it won't help so just continue on as u always have and eventually it will be evident in your behavior and they will be forced to drop the idea|`|veeC7Rvvaa	You are making a big deal of it this is why they keep teasing you. They know it's not true.. don't worry sweetheart, they know you're not arrogrant.. i could tell so from the way they tease you. Just laugh it off and turn the table on them by saying that they fancy the bi girl, too.|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Just laugh it off.  The more you rise to it the more she will do it.<br>  <br>  I love how comfortable your friend is with herself to laugh about her sexuality.  Take a leaf out of her book and just laugh things off|`|CjdCuWb1aa	wtf does fancy mean?<br>  <br>  and don't let it bother you.<br>  it's in the past. done. you can't change it now.

Maybe you could pull her to the side and talk to her? And it sounds like they're just teasing you, although if it gets serious, you can always tune them out. If she fancies you, that's that. If she doesn't, then you might get teased for a while. Also, if you let your friends know (seriously) that you were kidding about that comment, they might just listen.<br>  Good luck.<br>  *Results may vary. :)|`|dFrIXwNdaa	Just tell her to believe you and say "if you don't believe me that is your problem not mine" and if she still doesn't believe, well I have no other ideas that was my best I am sorry if it doesn't help. but I hope it does help with this situation. And like one of the people that answered before me it is in the past.|`|2vtwUAg4aa	I think you should talk to your friends and tell them how you feel.

Your friends SERIOUSLY need to grow up!<br>  <br>  xox|`|TELgi1siaa	your going to have to ask her out right if she does fancy you|`|JOtgNWrLaa	oh my god, your friend is being so juvenile. just tel her to think what she likes. and make it clear that you dont fancy her, i.e. when shes around, dont behave in such a way that they might think you fancy her, e.g. looking at her/hugging too much etc. this will probably pass. and im glad you are not affected by your friend's love notes. they probably are a joke. i go to an all girls school. people pass notes saying 'i love you' etc but its in a platonic way. im sure her love for you is platonic. and remind her you are staight :D so dont let anything affect your friendship :)|`|eKdRjaySaa	It's highly possible she does like you, but from your language I'm guessing your around 14-15 years old? ... Just a guess? Anyway...<br>  The best thing to do is continue about your business as per always anyway, I'm sure she understand you're heterosexuality and will keep boundaries? Alternatively you can take a more selfish option which may help, and do something like... Flirt in return, and see HER reactions, and body language... And see if it is true or not, then you can just discuss with her that you are and always will be only friends, that's what you're wanting I'm guessing?...<br>  -Body Language - See if she mirrors you<br>  -Eye Contact - Notice if she looks at you when you're not looking<br>  -How she acts towards other peers?...<br>  Just look at all those areas, and you'll have your answer...<br>  Be flattered though...<br>  And take it easy and relax... You'll always have awkward situations like this, from my experience, (I'm a guy btw so don't relate it too much to you)... Anyway, from my experience, I've found it always dies down... Boundaries and friendships - Google it :)|`|m1Yr8EMAaa	Just shake your head and smile, don't comment on it. If she sees that it aggravates you. (and I'm sure she is just messing with you) she will keep doing it. So ignore it, no reaction, no fun.|`|BaNrweQ4aa	i think your bisexual friend is just being a bit immature about this to be honest. if you are comfortable with her sexuality then good :) i think she is just trying to highlight her sexuality a lot more - and is asking for attention to be honest. you are obviously straight; and you made a tiny joke about it. big deal? everyone is allowed to make jokes. how did she find out you said that anyway? it's just your humour - and your friend should be familiar with that by now. SHE'S the one that should be dealing with mess like this, because she used to send you love notes. that's quite weird. that was a joke too - but you didn't start questionning her about that did you? because you know her humour. maybe she should think about what she says; and how she acts before she starts making you feel uncomfortable. she's not innocent in all this. next time she makes jokes or sends love notes or something; just don't play along with it. she can't take your jokes. why should you take hers? hers sounds more believable anyway - not yours. don't get frustrated about it. it will blow over and just don't care what anybody else thinks to be honest :D you're not up yourself'; it was a harmless joke. it's okay to make a big deal on here - because yahoo answers is for people to help you lol don't worry about it :) hopefully some things in there will help; or just make you feel a bit better anyway :)|`|4mdUJ9LHaa	Well, I really have been in that situation before. One of MY friends is bisexual. What you need to do is confront her. Ask her, do you like me? Tell her, if she says she does, say, I am sorry but I don't like you. I really do like you as a friend, but not as a G IRL friend. I had to do this with my friend, and she is still my best friend today! She will get it. Best of luck! -Brook|`|Mqr9xDxYaa	go along with it so much that it sounds stupid|`|V5TC4x6jaa	Just play along like you have been " yea she did fancy me and it was great dont be jealous you know you want her too" you know make a joke out of it.|`|36731eb87ae27985e56325cb4449a98baa	just ignore it when you get out of the school no one  is going to care or even remember for that matter.

Guys like to be the one that asks the girl out. You will come off as desperate and easy.

That's so impersonal. <br>  Good luck.<br>  *Results may vary. :)|`|skh0azhhaa	Don't. Never do the chasing. Plus, do you actually know this guy?

Haha. Some friends you just need to know as the friend you trust not to trust. It sounds stupid, but thats my opinion. Tell him the things you wouldn't mind people knowing, and maybe he was having a bad day. You never know. Then maybe you could start like tellinghim stuff again after a while?

If she is still living at home with her parents then the they have the right to claim her because she lives in their household.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	It may be that if she is living at home, her parents may be claiming her, which will prevent her from claiming herself.  She needs to talk with her parents to see if they are still claiming her, and ask them not to, so that she can do this for herself.  however, if she is living there, and they are still providing for her, and her children, then to me, they are entitled to that money.|`|bIimm8fSaa	She seriously needs to check into this.

You cannot get or need a divorce if you were never legally married.|`|WyCmQBuvaa	Yes, immediately.  According to the IRS, section 23 part 4 paragraph 3a ab of the gudelines for child keeping,<br>  "The party to the 2nd party must be parties to all those that are present with in the rules of state of your being and jointly returns are deemed illegal if a child is involved, conceived or claimed on forms 1777c, 1778b and 1776x."<br>  Hopefully you can get a divorce before April 15, so  you don't have to pay penalties and interest.|`|IuJjYz6gaa	Of course not.

I am going through the same thing. This guy i work with stares at me constantly, we flirt all the time, tease each other, have a great time, etc. But he has a gf that isn't going very well. Basically he is probably just keeping you around for fun until his gf thing gets back on the right track. Thats what my guy did. He got me so wrapped around his little finger, always starting conversations and everything when things were bad with his gf. Now that things are better with his gf, he barely talks to me. Just be careful. Keep in mind that he has a gf, and until he breaks up with her, if he does, he is off limits. Don't hope for something that may or may not happen. You only end up hurt, like me. <br>  <br>  Or maybe he really does like you. I am not a good person to answer this question i guess considering i am a little bitter about the subject. Just don't make yourself to available to him. You have to remember he does have a gf, and its not you. Like i said before BE CAREFUL.|`|d5sAojVmaa	Well it seems like he isn't getting something that he needs out of the relationship that he is in right now. He seems like maybe he has found that in you and is wanting to see if who you are is what he needs. Or, it could be that you are fun to talk to and you are interesting. Something that he may need in his life right now, something interesting. Best thing for you to do is talk to him. You spend hours talking to him anyways right!?!?|`|oHSsJ4Koaa	look when u are talking about the flirting online... i think he meant that as a joke.. guys do that, why would he be flirting with you when he has a girlfriend and i think he would break up with her to flirt with you so just think about if he really like you as a Friend or as a girlfriend|`|EJWphb88aa	wait and watch babes.. he will make the 1st move towards you very soon.. and accordingly u should be the best judge to date him or no.. on the other hand you said that he has a girl friend with whom things aren't working smooth, so u are presently an option for him.. but what about tomorrow... wen things wont be good with you he will start gazing and flirting with someone else.. be very careful...|`|Gb8cl8n2aa	just take it slow and steady ask for his past details from him and his friends..and take the whole stuff slow..|`|rjC7b0Sqaa	In my opinion it is never wise to try to get involved with someone who is already involved with someone else!  No matter how bad that relationship may be, you will always wonder if he will do the same thing to you.  <br>  <br>  Also not a good idea to get involved with someone you work with, if it doesn't work out their might be awkward feelings toward each other or even jealousy/anger.|`|lpaUM0ceaa	If this girlfriend isn't working with him, and you see him looking at you, if he looks like he is dreaming, you know like mouth open, then he probably does like you. If he is still with this girlfriend thought, before you make a move, you should wait for them to make up.|`|8o15QBiAaa	try to find out whether he's really in love with you or his girlfriend, coz u may not want to be branded "boyfriend snatcher", do you? otherwise he may be playing with you and wasting your time to get hooked up with other more caring guyz who may be interested in you|`|aBNf7KLsaa	i would ask for your "Friend" to come over|`|AA11715395	you almost sound like you're describing me!<br>  I had an uncannily similar experience, although it turns out he had a wife, not just the girlfriend.. but things weren't working.  We got together about 6 months ago, and we enjoy each others company, but I'm still not sure if he is the player.. or not..<br>  Work out how you feel, don't admit to it straight out, he could be playing you, but give it a go - if that's what you want, and see how things pan out, but prepare yourself and protect yourself from a would-be player.. just in-case.<br>  Hope this helps a bit..<br>  <br>  Good luck by the way.
BwGOjB1Raa	First off, you should truly go with what's in your heart.  Think about it, even if we told you to accept her apology and you did, that doesn't mean it would be sincere.  Go with what feels right.  Ask yourself a few questions:  Do I still love her?  Do I think sh'ed be able to trust me the same if we did get back together?  Would she believe me if I told her I would never hurt her?  Would we be able to get past this situation without it affecting us in the future?  Just think on it before you decide what's good for YOU.|`|tP2NScAiaa	you should accept her apology, give her another chance and just forgive her.<br>  people make mistakes.<br>  at least you know she cares, right?|`|hHndD5SEaa	tell her what you've told us - it sounds to me like you two want to be together - ok so she made a mistake and assumed something about you - but Im sure a lot of people could have made that mistake... talk to her.<br>  xx|`|KM50wTbHaa	i would just explain it to her. Its only normal for women in general to feel like she did. Before explaining though, accept her apology.|`|DWW9Ri8Jaa	Sorry, that is too big for me to read. Anyways, thanks for the points.|`|JPApIxo1aa	everyone makes mistakes (thats huge but) <br>  if u still have feelings for her atleast give it another go what have u got to lose?|`|aTzcqC4Naa	tell her all this. be honest. it should work out if you want it to and she really means what she says. i don't know if there would be trust issues though.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	she did that without knowing the truth...confront her why she did and if you still care up to you to give another chance but if your not sure let her go coz she may do it again..jumping into conclusion|`|d85aff64e15a29d3e932afd79e40640baa	Tell her exactly what you've said above.  If she loves you she'll listen.|`|CP5T4G5Maa	Only you can answer that one.  Do you still love her?  Sounds like she needs to work on her communication with you and that's something you should point out if you do get back together.<br>  I you were happy when you were together, why not give it another go? She seems genuinely sorry for how she behaved and may not be so quick to judge you next time, might be worth it?
iPNOVR6Gaa	If you put this much effort into making your marriage work, you wouldn't have to worry about it.|`|zFb022Iiaa	If you didn't have a prenup and she wants to push it then you guys share current assets (minus gifts) it doesn't really matter what was pre-existing.|`|8103f5a386f35ec2420460c4f3b3dcabaa	When parties divorced..they both have lawyers to work out the differences..property..investments..it is called ' divorce settlement'..per state laws/per guidelines.|`|JYgJD0Rwaa	It depends, if you live in a community property state then all assets and debts from each spouse will be split 50/50 during the divorce unless a pre-nup exists. That almost always includes what you had before marriage (hence the purpose of a pre-nup)<br>  If you are not in a comm. property state then the assets and debts will be split evenly between the spouses, usually allowing each spouse to keep what was theirs before marriage and split what they gained during marriage fairly between the two of them.|`|4e78695008f60b02690030274e8f9ee8aa	Lots depends on state laws.  Your best bet is to ask these questions to a divorce lawyer.  Sometimes consultations are not that expensive.  BUT, go with all your questions written down so you don't forget things when you are there.<br>  <br>  When I was divorced, my husbands 401K or pension can't remember was calculated, but instead of taking it out and cashing anything in, they added the amount to the sale of the house.  Like if we had to split 10K of the profit of the house sale.. he got $3K, I got $5K plus a couple of thousand from the 401K half.   If he had to remove his 401K money they would penalize him with fees.  So we found fair ways so we both would be ok.  The one thing I did not have was health insurance and he did, so I was allowed to still be in his health insurance and he was nice to keep paying the dues.. even though he could have technically just pay for single premiums... but in order to keep me he had to pay for family premiums.  He was fine with that... I did not request alimony or anything else.  Now, all our monies were acquired together so it's different than your case.  A lawyer helps tremendously.  Just ask how much they charge for divorces etc.  If you both are good people and it's not going to be ugly,  a divorce is simple and not expensive.|`|fc9ecb5a900817a0bcf8f6fa3590baf3aa	I would think it depends on where you live. Some states are community property states and some are not. Your best bet would be to go find a lawyer.|`|WypJADCuaa	If you go a file for a divorce before she does then you might come out ahead... Or get her to agree on a fair amount... If she files she will get 1/2 of what you have.. Trust me my current husband went through the same thing before we got married...He had investments 15 years before his second marriage and accumulated investments while married and ended up having to give her 1/2 of what he had before and during their marriage.
nCWjdyddaa	What someone else would do isn't the point. It's their house, they call the shots. I really don't believe they're going to kick you out, though, they're just very upset because they didn't think you'd go through with it. The fact that you and your brother were giggling and having a good time while you did it made it worse.<br>  <br>  Just tell your grandparents that you didn't realize it would upset them so much, and you're sorry to have upset them. That doesn't mean you're sorry to have shaved it, just that you're sorry it upset them.<br>  <br>  You seem to have some respect for your grandparents, and I do applaud that. But the idea that you have the right to do what you want because you're 19 is unrealistic. The bottom line is, they can choose whether or not you are there. So, if you want to stay, you have to make them happy. It may stink, but that's the way it is.|`|IggGQ4GEaa	That was just totally foolish of you to do something like that. You should have respected your grandparents authority and obeyed their wishes until you were on they're own. If they want to kick you out, I think it's totally within their rights. You are over 18 and chose to go against they're wishes and now you are going to have to pay the price:(|`|oVxr5B3Eaa	No, unless she did it on purpose to piss me off. Actually, my mom told me i'd get kicked out of the house if I ever cut my hair. I never went to a hairdresser while I lived at their house, and eventually got a friend to cut it in grade 9 when I couldn't take it any more. Seemed to go over just fine. <br>  But yeah, that is unreasonable. Do you still have the hair? If so, you should donate it. Tell them the reason you really cut your hair was to donate to cancer patients, and maybe they'll accept it a little more because you did it as a good deed. <br>  I think they'll get over it. Your hair will grow out (noticably) soon enough :)<br>  Good luck!|`|wj1dd6NMaa	I think you should re-post this question again.<br>  Because somehow only idiots have managed to answer it.|`|AA11303010	Honestly, we aren't there to hear your grandparents side of things. It SOUNDS to me like they made it clear they were against it, and you did it anyways, so...well...yes they can kick you out. They can kick you out for anything, it's their house. Would *I*? I don't know. If it were done to intentionally be rebelious, then probably I would, and it does in fact sound like you were doing it out of rebellion (rebellion against stereotypes, granted, but that does lead me personally to believe that you are a rebellious person if you are willing to actually shave your head to spite others opinions-so I am inclined to ask if your GPs haven't perhaps been experiencing rebellion with you for some time now? Just food for though!)<br>  Bottom line you are giving YOUR version of what they said, and as we all know that may or may not be accurate. They may have been more direct with their "no" or they may have assumed your intelligence to read into their implied "no"-my son is an adult and I rarely expect to have to hold his hand and dumb down every response I give him. He is intelligent enough to know whether I am OK with something or not. I think you knew they didn't want you too and did it anyways, and you did it for wrong reasons (to spite public opinion on the matter), so I would probably back them if they wanted you outta there. You are very wrong about ONE MAJOR thing-it's your right to do whatever you want, true. But that would assume you are in your OWN HOME, which you are NOT, my dear. So your little "right" just flew out of the window. That is not a right that ANYONE has while living under the roof of another, I don't care if you are 8 or 88<br>  PS-please tell me you at least cleaned up your mess afterwards.<br>  For the record, I am a southern baptist, and I have a nose ring and I am taking my son to get a tattoo next birthday. I have no notions against things that are different. But if my son had done something I was outwardly against, we'd have problems. And he's 19 just like you. He respects my home and opinion, and I let him live here because he knows the level of respect people who are being kind to you deserve<br>  <br>  ETA-you do an awful lot of justifying for someone who came here to ask others opinions. Obviously you think you are right and have a retort for anything one who thinks differently might say about it, so why bother asking-you obviously think they were wrong and have no room for any thought that you too may have some blame. Obviously only your grandparents are wrong in your mind, and you were righteously justified and remain on a pedestal of correctness and goodness-get a job and grow up, or stop soliciting opinions that you really don't want-What I am doing is not justifying-YOU are justifying -meaning you are explaining away your childish tantrum by saying why you were *JUSTIFIED* in acting poorly, because you obviously think your reasoning makes your actions OK. All I am doing is explaining why I think you were wrong.<br>  And newsflash cupcake, MILLIONS of kids work and go to school. My son is one of them. He knows how to be a responsible, contributing member of a family, rather than just use "well, I'm goin ta skoooooooollll' as an excuse to act like an indulged brat (ie YOU)|`|b9ff940610f4c3ac65317b30bae44184aa	They are definitely overreacting.  It could be they are worried about the unsolicited attention or assumptions this will bring you or themselves. Assumptions like being a lesbian or a skinhead or being failed grandparents. It could be they are simply old fashioned. <br>  <br>  It is slightly radical for our culture, although men do it all the time. <br>  <br>  The short answer is no. I would never threaten to throw my daughter, if I had one, out of the house for shaving her head.|`|zUdxoRbyaa	my daughters would never get kicked out for anything. we have always talked things out.|`|NiRFYhVDaa	no its your decision..but why you have to do it beats me|`|237f7b8deabaa8cf367ed76288106f19aa	first of all keep in mind that your grandparents are old fashioned. Plain and simple. Their ideas are going to drastically differ from yours on many ideas. It is respectable to them for you to adhere to their beliefs while they are helping support you.To them this is something they Truly believe and is not something stupid. Another thing is, think of this... The concept of a woman shaving her head is taboo. It is often associated with going off the deep end. (ex: the way people reacted when Brit Spears shaved her head) When a woman does something this drastic it appears that there may be bigger issues that what meets the eyes. I have a hard time believing that you only shaved your head for "convenience" I know I have said a time or two how I would love to shave my head to just not deal with it anymore, but there is that part in your brain that stops you and reminds you that it might not be the best idea and I didn't follow thru. I feel that your grandparents might believe there are more issues involved than just a whim to be bald for convenience.  They may possibly believe that you have dipped into drugs, alcohol or some other substance that would skew your judgment. I think that it would be wise to take a deeper look into your life and see if there are any other issues that may need to be delt with. You are still young and have a lot of life to live, so just be safe and be aware of yourself. Just because you shaved your head doesn't mean your crazy, just expressive. But find out what is really causing such a drastic expression.
yOHCXiaMaa	WHY do people get into things that are not theirs.  Hon, that picture could have been taken as a joke or maybe to prove to the higher ups that she is not doing her job.  CRIPES!<br>  <br>  Insecurity is one of the biggest causes of divorce.  You should first apologize for getting into HIS belongings.  Then say I see you caught one of your co-workers sluffing on the job.  Did she get into trouble for it.  That way it doesn't put him on the offensive.<br>  <br>  Last, HON if you don't want to know something then don't go looking for it.  A picture on a phone is not something to get excited about until you know for sure he's doing wrong.  You ruin the stability of the marriage, the trust in the marriage and you tear up your own heart wondering about something that was nothing.  Now a picture of her in her drawers, or worse, naked is another thing.  Even a cameo can give away feelings if you look at their eyes. (Windows to the heart)<br>  <br>  I know people believe, when they get married, they have the right to violate another's space.  But how would you feel if he all of a sudden dumped your purse out and started rifling through it.. got into your cell phone or found your daily diary and started reading it.  All people have the right to privacy.  Its that little space that gives them the strength to share the big space.  I'm not trying to embarrass you but make you understand that you are two individuals, living in the same enviroment and there has to be boundaries that one does not cross.|`|SsfnitjXaa	I would down load the picture and post copies of it all over the house, on the mirror in the bathroom, put one in his wallet and multiple copies all over the bed.  <br>  <br>  This is totally disrespectful.<br>  <br>  Then I would phone her and ask her why she send him her picture.<br>  <br>  You have problems and it has nothing to do with paying your bills.|`|NuUdCz0Laa	Having spend many years with paramedics and even now my wife works for a company that runs an emergency services program.  Paramedic teams spend so much time together, that relationships are formed, some sexual and some friendships.  It is difficult on you, I understand, but you have to realize that he only spends a few hours a week with you, one on one.  He spends twice or even three times the hours with his partner.  So, although he may love you, he has grown closer to his partner than you.  I would have a talk with him and voice your concerns and allow him the opportunity to state his case.  The only way this relationship will work is with trust and commitment.  Good luck.|`|NqbBjS0raa	I really see no good reason for having her picture on his phone. People keep loved ones and good friends along with close relatives pictures in their house, but personally on them it looks out of place. I would address the issue and point out what significance she needs to be with him on a picture 24/7. That's the point I would bring up and say I have only loved ones in my wallet, and relatives close to me. Need I say anything more?.......|`|zFb022Iiaa	Doesn't sound appropriate, when I just saw the header to the question I was thinking well if they call a lot as part of their job, many people have the headshot in their phone directory that displays when they call.

I can see it happening, to send someone or something, but not him keeping it.|`|AA11447210	You will do nothing but stew over it if you don't address it. Tell him how you feel (don't accuse) and that seeing as you two don't see each other much and it's stressing you out, the picture was unexpected and causes you to feel uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  See what happens...talk about it. Hopefully a pic of a coworker on a sofa won't be more important than calming your insecurities during this time of relationship stress. He'd be a fool to intentionally add to it.|`|W8aiAWe2aa	This sounds harmless like he took a sneaky photo of her asleep possibly as a joke.|`|1K3IiAUWaa	I noticed a picture!  Give me a break.

You are not part of that!<br>  <br>  Ok You did what you did.  Do you really want to confront his supposed inappropriate event with you own.  Consider this.  A co-worker picks up your phone and takes a picture of a male where you work for some insignificant reason or another.  To you it is nothing.  If the situation were reversed, and your husband asked you about that photo, what would your explanation be.  And better yet, would you be ok if he jumped to conclusions like you did.|`|AA11297232	Most likely took a photo to show her what she is doing while she is suppose to be working.

She sounds horrible, but maybe because she's very down so try to understand and comfort her. Also, don't go through this alone. Have a talk with your dad about this. He should do some cheering up too.|`|NqxWZEYgaa	Erm... I think your mum does not mean it, really... don't ever think of killing yourself... Committing suicide is a very stupid thing to do, yu know?

DWFMM23Caa	its true, you do "just know".  <br>  <br>  other than that your body will tell you, you will get really excited when you see them, you might go red, your heart might skip a beat (but in a good way) your hands might get sweaty, you will feel warm and fuzzy when your around them, you won't have to say a word to each other and just enjoy each others company, you will love being in their arms or them in yours, you will say nice things to each other, you might have secret language that only the two of you understand.  <br>  <br>  when you are apart they will be on your mind all the time, you will look forward to their phonecalls/text messages and you will jump everytime the phone rings/bleeps in the hope that it is them. you will dream about them, you will daydream about them.  if something happened to them or anyone close to them you would feel their pain because in some way you would be connected to them and have a special bond.|`|GvTg2jDfaa	If you havent known them for more than five years...you simply cant.

2BesFBv9aa	Oh wow. You poor thing. Look I'm afraid to say it seems as though she's made her mind up. You have tried everything and its clearly not worked. The best advice I can give you is to give her space, alot of it. Everything you are doing and have been doing may just be too much for her. She probably needs time to think and with all the attention you are giving her you may be pushing her further away. I know you hurt alot right now, and I know the pain is horrendous. But ts kinda like the saying goes "if you love something set it free if it comes back it was meant to be".<br>  She may have made her mind up completely, and you may just hae to accept that, however hard it's going to be. If its been 2 years then it looks like she has made up her mind. If you're still living together, stay at a distance but be her friend. If you're living apart, seriously give her space. <br>  I'm so sorry about your predicament, I hope you get some closure from it.|`|f9Wq6AyFaa	You sound like a very caring guy. I wish my husband would be a little more thoughtful. Have you tried talkint to her about how she makes you feel.Most guys don't talk about their personnal feelings.

Slow down and take the time to talk.|`|58JgbttAaa	well unfortunately there's really nothing you can do. she doesn't want to be with you well then f-her, after all it is HER lost so all you can do is be strong and move on. i'm pretty sure in the future you will find someone who truly loves you and deserves you!|`|c5UAa65qaa	Do you know what happened to make her fall out of love with you?  Romantic gestures won't help if they don't satisfy whatever she's missing, or if they come across as acts of desperation instead of genuine affection.<br>  <br>  Talk to her.  Try and go to counseling: preferably together, or by yourself if necessary.  But if she's genuinely given up on the relationship, you may have no choice but to do the same.|`|FIG58FVpaa	Unfortunately, you really can't make someone love you and you definitely can't buy their love with flowers and candy.<br>  <br>  I have no idea how long you've been married... but chances are good that this is something that has been growing and growing for awhile (at least the past two years) and if it's to the point where she felt she had to tell you and had to do something about it.<br>  <br>  The two of you really have to have a discussion about what to do next. I feel bad for you, but it sounds like you're headed for a divorce. :(<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|WVcUweTEaa	You can't force anyone to love you back, you can't control anyones emotions but your own.<br>  <br>  You need to let her go.<br>  <br>  You need to have more respect for yourself, focus and take care of yourself (and children if you have any).<br>  <br>  Sounds like she is taking all you are giving to her, but giving you nothing in return.  She will continue to take until  you make a drastic change and stop kissing her azz.  Maybe once you stop focusing on her and start focusing on yourself and your future either she will come running back to you and kiss your azz or someone better will come along and brighten your life.<br>  <br>  You need to really take the guy's responses on here as your guide on what to do...many of them have fantastic suggestions!|`|tvK1xjzkaa	You can't make someone love you.

She's obviously not interested in making things work with you anymore, and you can't make her love you again, so I would let her go. Tell her that you love her, but if she's unhappy in the relationship, you don't want to be in love with someone who doesn't feel the same way. You owe it to yourself to be with someone who loves you the same way you love her.|`|wWzK6eJaaa	Ik this sucks but you cannot make some one love you, as much as we try to change the other persons mind, its impossible. Especially since most people are stuck in their ways. I dont think it was right for her to be with you for the past two years if she didnt love you, plus y would you want a woman who plays head games.

May sound harsh but it will make it easier on u in the long run. Never make something not meant to be go on and on.

End it asap.|`|u1Oi6tGHaa	Don't waste any more years of your life on someone that will never be satisfied with you.  I had the same situation.

When a woman has made up her mind that she doesn't love someone, it's done.  There is nothing you can do and it's like sailing a sinking ship.<br>  <br>  My wife did the same thing but we were only married for less than a year. We separated in April last year and she was already dating a new guy by November last year. I know EXACTLY what you're going through.<br>  <br>  Dude, it's going to hurt...a lot. But the worst thing you could do is stay.  I moved out, I'm not even in the same town as her.  I don't talk to her at all.  Focus on you, you're career.  I've been trying to get back into shape, learning guitar and I'm taking some time just to get to know myself again.  Do some great things for others - help your buddy move, walk their dog, stuff like that.  Creating some good experiences will give you some strength.  I know that last November I cut over a foot and a 1/2 of hair off for Cancer Kids. I felt great about it. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong. I still think about my wife every single day and I don't think I'll ever marry another person. I may very well find someone but that's not a priority.  Whatever you do, DON'T rebound. <br>  <br>  I know I have my really rough days where I feel so unmotivated and want to be alone.  I'm not trying to scare ya but I'd rather you enter the situation with an open mind.<br>  Good luck buddy.

JhvqUvlsaa	Get into a romantic mood (watch a movie with her) and afterward get all lovey dovey and take her hand and start moving towards her. If she's into it, then pull her close and gently kiss her. If you start getting hard don't worry about it; move that part of your body away from her if it is uncomfortable for you. It's natural you know so don't be embarassed; make a joke about it if she notices and mentions it.|`|yte0BzXKaa	Your scared of getting hard and her feeling it?<br>  How can kissing someone make you hard?<br>  <br>  Anyways, i don't think she'll have a problem if she feels it.

3b6eEugsaa	If you aren't happy then you need to end the relationship. You can't be guilted into staying with her just because you discussed marriage with her. <br>  <br>  Think about it- it's better to do it now than to get married and then divorced.<br>  <br>  YOU need to be your biggest concern in a situation like this. It's not selfish- it's just looking out for yourself.|`|mfcVhbYhaa	I think the best way to let her go is to make her think you aren't the best guy for her right now.<br>  Just don't be good like you used to for a while, I am not talking about being a bad guy or something. Just do the stuff she don't like.<br>  That would be the way SHE would break with you and You won't bother so much too.|`|ZUwBvmNzaa	Theres no easy way to break up with someone. But the longer you leave it the harder it will get, im not saying do it now but i would say do it in the near future.<br>  Your 26 and still young and so is she so it wont exaclty be the end of the world. I think if you've given it time and told her and she cant change then things arnt working. I think you should talk to her about it first.|`|myBoF6Dvaa	Whoa...Crisis.<br>  Don't immediately tell her :<br>  "Hey hunny, I think you're really effing annoying.

It will be a huge relief for both of you- eventually.|`|P3iNXNx2aa	You can't change a person|`|9FoFYfvdaa	just be like..<br>  dude..<br>  ur freakin annoying..<br>  ur 23..<br>  stop acting so childish..<br>  my bf tells me im annoying all the time..<br>  lol..<br>  =]|`|nLy4TcjZaa	tell her that she is annoying and dump her.|`|bAzI8VWfaa	try to work it out as best u can just tell that shes annoying u again every time she does it<br>                                     i say this good rate|`|ZtyqiUwCaa	maybe your to mature for her and she is probably out of ur league like she needs a funny guy|`|7ocvtrZnaa	I think you should just have sex, just do it.|`|jaOEtAHKaa	There's nothing more tender than a woman's heart.... Why cant u adjust????|`|QHpq3QpAaa	Break up with her, she'll get over it.|`|b455e7e5ef382907322ac029d8e12a86aa	I think you are ready to move on.  You can't change people--you can't even get them to change little annoying things in their behaviour.  When you are in a relationship, you've got to be able to at least tolerate everything, and I mean everything, about them.  If she's not what you thought she was, then it's time to let her down as easily as possible.  That's not to say that it's going to be easy--you just have to be as tactful and polite as possible while she throws a fit or begs you to reconsider.  But if you do decide to break up with her, be firm about it.  And for God's sake, don't be one of those people who want to try to be friends, or want to get together for a little booty call once in awhile.  That sends mixed signals and she will start thinking you might want her back.  Nope--sounds like you are not ready for marriage with this one, and it's time to hit the road.  Do it, and don't look back.  There are plenty more out there, and it's time for you to go fishing.|`|8j7FCEOraa	Why would you be engaged if you have so many problems with her?<br>  She tries to 'fix herself'??? Excuse me, she doesn't need to fix anything! Being with someone brings out the best in both of you, it doesn't mean you have to change who you are!<br>  <br>  Dude, you should just as immature as you are making her sound<br>  <br>  Talk to her, communicate like a real adult does and tell her your not ready.|`|IVjspiStaa	tell her, communicate. talk with her. this will make your relationship stronger. gl|`|vSHkZWUoaa	yes, just break up with her|`|6c1639b085f1a5fa992d7054377ac71faa	time to break it off.|`|qszeZXwWaa	I think u should just tell he that u want a breakup, and that one day she will find someone better than u (no offense but that's the way to console girls).

And then both of u will only get sadder.|`|yotUSWcIaa	Tell her exactly what you just typed.<br>  See how she feels about it, how she reacts, and how you react to that. Come to an agreement - some kind of trial maybe, or break it off. You've got to decide on that. Hope you make the right decision. =]|`|AVYuZ9uIaa	be honest but don't be brutal, and if you decide to break up then break up. don't call her when your lonely or indulge in booty calls (it only makes things complicated).|`|CJvHQl5vaa	Gently break up with her.  Don't chew her out, don't make her feel negatively about herself, just break up with her.|`|yMTCaB8qaa	WHAT? you wanna marry her when you don't really like her! well just tell her the truth!|`|V6dz395kaa	slap her across the face! no, don't do that. Break up w/her in the most kindest way u can.|`|uIg6an6Jaa	then break up with her.....|`|eWObKmBSaa	Tell her the truth.  If you do not feel like being around her now, what if you do marry her, she won't change overnight.  Looks like you both have some sowing the oats, as it goes to do.  You are not yet, finding your interest in life and marriage too early will bring babies too early.  Sounds like at 23 she also is too young, let her go away, grow up and go your way.  But do not talk marriage again, that is a girl thing that they can get carried away with.  Be honest, if you are not feeling the same, believe me, marriage will not change either of you for the positive.  Tell her the truth, then split, you two.
CkN4pgpCaa	Ummm... no, you are not wrong for leaving her out of the wedding.  She is clearly jealous and slightly insane!  <br>  <br>  You can tell her that you and your fiance agreed on a certain number of attendants and there wasn't room, or that he wanted your bridesmaids to be friends that he knows, but honestly- you don't have to give her any reason!  You should not have to justify this to her.  If she isn't as insane as she sounds, then you can ask her to still be involved in the wedding... as a reader or guest book attendant.  But if she is that insane.. then just stay away and be glad that she won't be standing next to you on your big day!|`|qRIMM2ycaa	Why are you asking who's wrong?<br>  <br>  She's not a close friend, and she hopes you choke on your cake... Clearly not someone you want in your close loving circle of family and friends.<br>  <br>  If she asks why, simply say her response should be proof enough of why she wasn't chosen.<br>  <br>  Or you could be polite and explain that you didn't want to get out of hand, and only chose your absolute closest friends.|`|5gtbGwMPaa	Wow!!  I wouldn't have asked her to be in my wedding.  The bridal party you select is usually close to you and share "intimately" as close friends or relatives.  She must have thought your relationship was closer than what it is.  She sounds a little nutty- she's in the wrong.  Good Luck on your special day!!!!|`|xvPsAonzaa	It sounds like she feels as if you are one of her "best" friends, but you may not feel the same, or don't have enough room for everyone that you'd like to have.  I would give her a call, or better yet send her a personal note with an explanation.  I guess that's why us guys try not to get too overly involved in the planning, we're not real good at dealing with these emotional situations.<br>  <br>  Good Luck and All the Best!|`|CsfskhO1aa	No, i think you and her have diffrent definiontions of the relationship you two share<br>  you need to analyze that<br>  and let her know<br>  "although ive known you since forever, things change..and so do people"|`|SflneyGEaa	With a response like that I would say don't invite her to the wedding at all! If you're not that close then you have no reason to have her in the wedding.|`|CLdM1OsLaa	No. <br>  Why if your not close with her. <br>  She should just get over it. <br>  Its your wedding it should be perfect;; the way you want it, and that wasn't including her.|`|kYGIAu5Kaa	who is getting married? YOU? then that is your answer right there. The only person that can be correct in this question is YOU and YOUR SO..|`|6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	Perhaps you are a closer friend for her than she is for you and she is hurt to find out that you don't feel that way. Obviously weddings are important to the bride, but they are just as important to your friends as well because not being put in the wedding party is a low blow. Maybe you should try talking to her about why you didn't put her in and she might be able to see your reasoning. Your friendship means a lot to her as shown by her words for you. <br>  Just remember it is your wedding and if she cannot accept the fact that she is not in the wedding party than she is not someone you want around anyway because she will just bring you down. But I would definitely try to talk to her about it and see if you can reach an understanding. She may not like it, but it's your day, not hers.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	wow.  what a beoch.  I hope you're not going to invite her as a guest or have anything to do with her ever again.  you have to show her that kind of behavior isn't acceptable.  she really showed her true colors.  yeah I've been surprised to be left out of peoples weddings and others I've been surprised to be included but I never said anything one way or the other.  how inconsiderate of your feelings?|`|de947568c9e8173e12d8a9930bab48abaa	I think you need to remove this psychobitch from your life permanently.|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	you're not close.  I don't get why she would expect to be in the wedding.  Given her incredibly immature reaction, I'd think twice about even inviting her to the wedding.  <br>  <br>  you weren't wrong and she's proved to you that she would just create unnecessary drama if you did have her in the wedding.  Chances are this friendship was over long ago and this was just the final killing blow for her.|`|w1necKzYaa	it is your wedding you can have whoever you want as your bridesmaids!|`|8j7FCEOraa	No, if shes not close to you then why should she be there?<br>  Furthermore, if shes going to act like a stupid spoiled brat you have even more reason to not want her there.|`|AA11380378	Some one who delivers a treat and acts so childish certainly would not make it to the guests list.|`|cGbTJobeaa	She may not know you as a couple, but from her perspective, she has maintained a 17 year friendship with you.  Apparently the bond between you was closer from her perspective than yours.<br>  <br>  As for her choking wish.....sounds like you just saved yourself $100 since you won't be inviting her and her guest to the reception!|`|a984cQjKaa	if you're not close, then no, you're not wrong for not making her a part of the wedding party.  in fact, i'd tell her that her outburst has caused her to be disinvited from the wedding entirely.  if the little psycho was invited in the first place, that is.|`|sGP6s7uraa	You're not wrong for not putting her in the wedding.  She's just being visicious and catty.  It's your day and you should have your closest friends/family there beside you.  The ones who know will be there for and your FH and support your wedding.|`|iKYNUni0aa	heck no your not shes being ignorant and selfish its your day and you choose who YOU want to be in your wedding party|`|ZYCYiTT7aa	What lead her to believe she should even be in the wedding?...That sounds like she feels closer to you then you are to her. She is really upset about something to say such harsh things, That's Nuts!|`|VCz1CtiLaa	No, if she was your friend she would understand and never say something like that. She sounds like a real b**** and you're smart not asking her to be in your wedding|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	no your not wrong her feelings were hurt but tell her to look at it this way you saved her alot of money she doesn't have to go buy a dress she'll never wear again|`|vtW3qPZmaa	Not wrong at all - it's your choice.  And if I were you I'd choose not to invite her at all.  She sounds like a psycho.
veZLfnGFaa	He's avoiding you.  Talk to him and see what the problem is.|`|jztZxJ5paa	well ask him over the fone or something maybe he is just being stupid or maybe he is tring to tell you to leave him alone well i now i would never do that to my friends|`|YHwaJOCTaa	if you really want to repair the friendship, you have to make an effort and talk. don't mess it up by sounding accusing; talk with him rather than to him. sometimes all it needs is good communication.<br>  hope i helped a bit. good luck.|`|k8zvtOifaa	Only way to find out is to ask him. Good luck.
djUMvICoaa	I'm kind of torn on this one.  It's like yes, you've had the good, bad and ugle with him, yet for some reason you still carry his torch.  He says the same for you.  It could work, it may be worth checking out.  If you do, try to keep your eyes wide open and take it slow.  If you can do that it may have some chance.|`|HsltRUOGaa	I can't tell you if it's a good idea for you to think about getting back together with him; but I will pose one question.  If he is so gung-ho about seeing you and wanting to prove his undying love for for you why doesn't he come to visit you?  He doesn't have any kids and you do so traveling is easier on him.  I know he's in the military but my fiancee is a marine and they get loads of personal leave time every year.  I would make him come to you and then you can evaluate the situation from a more comfortable perspective.  Good luck with this!|`|gYWDrHVFaa	Leave it be...chances are you are both very different people now.  He is divorced that many times for a reason!

HvbIE03saa	Since she hasn't been in for long, she should be able to with drawl from classes without it appearing as a W on her record, it will probably appear as a D (dropped class), but shouldn't be a big deal. As long as she's not at the school on a scholarship or have financial aid that is dependent on her taking a certain amount of classes (like the GI Bill) then she should be fine. <br>  <br>  If she's not willing to talk to any supervisors, maybe you can call on her behalf and ask how she would be affected?
yLkP0y4taa	there's only one answer for your question...ask her to go to the cinema or eat somewere and talk to her! ask her if she does love you or she is just maybe trying to make you become jealous by talking and hanging out with other people. =)|`|nYEwK5FNaa	Give up on her. She is immature.

2o3BHgCCaa	STD's aside, you should only stop wearing a condom (if either of you aren't on other birth controll) if you have a solid plan for children.<br>  <br>  The STD side can be taken care of by both of you going for a test beforehand. It is free at most sexual health clinics.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	well if you're getting married you should both be clean and be sure the other person is telling the truth.  it's nice she trusts you but is she trying to get preggers?  I say use condoms until you're married and then start having babies, not now.|`|ef3e8a055f877ac48bf7cb67749b1830aa	Sinc eyou are in an exclusive relationship, try one of the other options.  You can get a shot that lasts for 3 months, you can get several different brands that last for 3 months.  And then there are hundreds of once a month brands.  She needs to go to the ob-gyn to talk about what option works best for her.<br>  <br>  Your other option is just to be pregnant when the wedding rolls around but I'm not sure if you are both ready for that.|`|RA3p25Qoaa	If you two are engaged I think you should already know each others sexual history and any STI issues that may be a factor. That is a conversation that needs to take place prior to becoming sexually active with one another. <br>  <br>  The birth control pill is a wonderful thing. It can be a ladies best friend or their worst nightmare. It can be forgotten or not be as effective depending on what other medication you may have to take.  That's why I'm a firm believer in Condoms and Birth Control pills together. That way both parties are taking measures to prevent pregnancy. <br>  <br>  If the pair of you as a couple have decided not to use condoms you need to have the " baby talk" are you both okay with the chance of pregnancy?  Are you financially ready if a pregnancy does come about?  If you don't want kids yet look into other forms of birth control go visit your doctor or sexual health clinic and find out what you can about other forms of birth control. <br>  <br>  If the issue is the feel of the condom is the issue there are many brands and styles out there. <br>  <br>  If you in an adult committed relationship your sex life is your own business.  But personally I think before you decide to give up condoms there needs to be some conversations taking place. When it comes to sex it can't just be one person making all the decisions|`|RC8Pxx8eaa	I would till go in covered unless you want a pregnant bride, you take the lead here and I thought it was rather strange that the phrase "She has assured me that she has no problems with std or anything." and the word "fiancee" would be uttered in the same sentence.<br>  Why are you marrying her when you dont know her sexual history ?|`|f6ab3ae3fee781c3975ea305670f972faa	STDs aren't the only thing condoms help protect you from and STDs aren't the only consequence of unprotected sex.<br>  <br>  Are you positive that she is on some kind of BC?  how do you feel about becoming a father sometime very soon if she isn't?|`|8j7FCEOraa	I accidentally thumbs down KillerApple<br>  So, for the record, I completely agree with her!|`|ZYCYiTT7aa	That's cool if you trust her! You asked to marry her, so you should know if your ready to stop wearing protection! You should both go get checked out anyway before the wedding to clear up any confusion on both ends. You both will enjoy the freedom from condoms.. Good luck on the Wedding!|`|6UmRmaeWaa	I would hope she doesn't have and STD your engaged! I would only worry about making babies be careful if your not ready to reproduce yet.|`|iKYNUni0aa	u both should get tested first and find an alternative contraceptive if you dont want to use condoms i dont see anything wrong with not using a condom if you in a monogamous relationship|`|AA10958492	I'm going to be completely honest with you.

Good luck! :)|`|CkN4pgpCaa	I can't tell you if your fiance has an STD or anything... that's something you have to decide if you trust or not.  Are you ready for children?

Are you staying for his benefit or your own?<br>  <br>  I've been in a situation very similar and you can't change a person. All you can do is give them advice, set some rules for YOURSELF and follow them. Don't let your behavior enable his. His parents do that enough.<br>  <br>  Good luck! Follow your instincts and do what's best for you.|`|XVDfCFXBaa	really the only thing you can do is don't enable him and show him tough love. if that don't change him then honey move on. you won't get where you want to be in life if you stick with a loser. they will ionly bring you down.

I would call the police, well actually meet with the police, and tell them what she is doing as far as giving heroin to your cousins, because basically she is dealing it when she does this.  Anyway you can see what they say, or you can also video tape her doing this, where she is providing the drugs to your lil cousins, and show the video to the police.  Heroin is very addicting, so your cousins are probably addicted and will need help by going ot rehab.  I would suggest making a copy of the video....not to post anywhere, but the police will keep one copy and the other you will need to show to your cousins parents.  But I would not hit her, because she could press charges against you and you could end up in jail.....there are other ways to get her, that will work better than hitting her.....plus you are not helping your cousins.....getting her out of their lives is helping.....but you can bet if they to are addicted, they will find a supplier.....they will have to go to rehab.|`|HvbIE03saa	If she's so heavy into heroine, how bout you call the cops on her next time you know she's carrying or using. Seeing her hauled away in cuffs is a sweater revenge than YOU being hauled away in cuffs for assault!<br>  <br>  Otherwise, just try to avoid her as much as possible. If she's at your house or your mother/mother in laws house without permission you can call the cops for trespassing.|`|uskqX5bNaa	WOW.<br>  I'm a lot like that too.<br>  People shouldn't mess with us.<br>  Um, well the way I look at it,<br>  you could just ignore her,<br>  or prevent her from coming around.<br>  I mean does your brother in law know that she is doing<br>  all of these things?<br>  maybe he wouldn't want to hang around her so much.<br>  Well good luck!<br>  Don't hurt her too badly!
mfbKe04Xaa	sweety there is no such thing as a superwomen or superwife...you need balance...i too am very acctive in the church...but i will not take on more than i should....i have kids and a wonderful hubby but i set homemade meals to like 3 days and easy meal to others and go out to eat remaining days..you need balance or you will drain easily....talk to your hubby and spilt the work.....but overall that is just the real world..you have to pay bills in order to survive...let your hubby go with his friends that way you will have a chance to unwind...go with a friend or alone and take time for yourself...and sometimes you can't do it all hon....just look for balance....you have to clean or no one will do it, you have to cook or no one will eat...you have to run errands....no one will do those things for you...talk to hubby and if he dont do it...cut your load in half....you'll do fine...|`|RmVSz5j2aa	I would make him clean the house and do the laundry every now and then. if both of you are working then there is no reason why you should do everything. i do everything around the house, but i'm not working right now either. makes a difference.|`|J9IXHDbRaa	sheloves_dablues NAILED IT.<br>  <br>  "Your husband is your partner, not your master..."  <br>  <br>  What is it, exactly, that he does to help you with this situation?  It's his house and home too... why does it all have to fall on to you to do?|`|6XKlW3lyaa	So what is he doing around the house?  He can't expect you to do all that if he isnt out chopping wood for the fire or fixing the barn or something.|`|fc1n9vBjaa	Marriage is a partnership, not a dictatorship.|`|AA10561878	remember it's 50/50|`|CWVBfaPwaa	You shouldn't have to do it all! He needs to help! Stop doing his laundry and he'll either have to wear dirty clothes or wash them himself. Stop cooking for him. He's a big boy, he can cook for himself. Once he realizes how much you do for him maybe then he'll help you out around the house. good luck!!<br>  BTW I'm a stay at home mom, I do, do most of the housework (which should be expected since I'm at home) but my husband still helps me out around the house. If I don't feel like cooking he'll do it. He helps the kids with their homework if I'm busy doing something else. He'll put laundry away if I ask him to.|`|CjFH2Gq0aa	First of all, this is the 21st century where women as well as men keep up with the house chores and cook. So, I don‚Äôt see why you have to do all that when you have a husband. What else does your husband do then going to work? And yet he wants space. That‚Äôs a lie. It sounds like you guys barely even spend time together. Maybe he needs that time to meet other women. Be though. Don‚Äôt buy all that. To have time to yourself, you need to give him some chores too. Who asked you to get marry so early????|`|Ir9jGOo2aa	I think you may need your clarify your question.. Are these things your husband is requiring of you, or do you just simply want to do all these things?  You are young, however you made a choice to be married and a lot of responsibility comes along with that.  I agree with many of the others, ask for help you can't do this all.  Your marriage will become a burden and you will not enjoy it.  Don't forget to squeeze in time for each other, take a small inexpensive trip /get-a-away. Plan a relaxing day off with just each other, no chores, or errands.  Enjoy your marriage, do what you can and the balance will come in time.|`|d7bJIgqlaa	I've been married for 10 months and you're right that marriage comes with alot of responsibility too.  It is a partnership though and he's going to have to give.  Your note sounds like he EXPECTS this of you and MAKES you do it.  If that is the case you need counseling because you are not to live your life controlled.<br>  <br>  If on the otherhand it just came across wrong and he's really a great guy who just doesn't do much around the house then you can jump in the boat with a lot of us youngins with husbands.  :)  My husband does a lot of handy work and likes to build things for the house, but that is it.  We have had some fights where I just cry because I couldn't believe marriage was about cooking and cleaning constantly.  I learned that he has to be asked to do things.  Since our many arguements things have changed some... we hired a maid, I love to cook, but when I'm tired he will do it.  I have to ask him to help clean up after dinner.  He isn't good about picking up after himself at all.  He unloads the dishwasher on his own.  I ask for help with laundry.  He doesn't mind to help at all, I've learned, he just doesn't know what to do.  I hope your husband is the same and will catch on to a few helpful chores.<br>  <br>  Also, a written honey-do list will do wonders!|`|zjH9MDYyaa	God said that when two people get married they become one person SO since you are one together you need have the responsibilities split a little bit maybe he can run some of the errands for you or take turns doing the shopping and maybe each of you can have one night a week that you guys can go your own ways and he can chill with his boys and you can have a little me time i also plan all the meals ahead for the week and pre cook as much as i can in one day that way it cuts your cooking time in half and when you do your cleaning maybe make yourself a rotation and have different chores for different days im going to be 20 in a month and my husband is going to be 23 soon and we were married when i turned 18 and I felt overwhelmed just like you but once you get a system down and learn that he doesnt expect you to be superwoman (and if he does theres a problem) things get a lot easier|`|mvKDbb2uaa	You've listed what you do, but what does your husband do?<br>  <br>  Being married means sharing responsibilities.  You and your husband should be sharing that work load and he should really be sensitive enough to that to offer the help.  In addition, you have to take a step back and assess what you are doing and taking on and may find that you need to cut back on a few things and let go some of the things you've taken on.  Time to yourself is important, so don't neglect that.  Talk to you husband and tell him how overrun you feel and that you both need to share some of these responsibilities.|`|dd2d386096f95b4c9c13d046234f4dddaa	Sweetie,<br>  <br>  Cooking and cleaning are not your "responsibilities as a wife".  Neither is shaving your body every day.  If that's what you think marriage is all about, you are dead wrong.<br>  <br>  Your husband is your partner, not your master.  If you both work, you both have to take care of the homefront TOGETHER.  You've been running yourself ragged for 7 months.  It's time for your husband to step up and take responsibility for his half of the marriage.|`|CCFhjtNBaa	Why are you doing it all? this isn't normal except for weak women.|`|7w2kCTDJaa	If your husband lives in your house with you, why is he not doing any of these things? He is not too good to wash dishes or vacuum or do some laundry. Honestly, you're not his mother or his maid. If you are doing every single thing household wise plus working full time plus all the errands, basically you are supporting yourself & letting him live with you. If you don't speak up now & force him to participate in the household duties, you are in for a lifetime of misery & resentment. Why should he get to have all that free time while you are working your butt off at home? This is hardly fair. <br>  <br>  If you guys have kids, who do you think is going to be doing everything involving childcare PLUS everything else you already do? You need to tell him now that you doing all this work isn't going to fly. And mean it.|`|Whd6tqLzaa	First of all ask your husband to help you out with household chores. Secondly, buy some pre-cooked, pre-cut meals or part of the meal, so that you don't have to spend too much time in the kitchen. Even though you cook, cook some extra, freeze it for next week or another day. Thirdly, don't take a bath and shave yourself everywhere everyday. Take a quick shower, save the shaving for the weekends, why do you need to shave yourself everyday? Save the groceries and paying bills for the weekend.   Take turns, have your husband do it every other weekend. Paying bills don't take every week. Choose a day in the month and pay all your bills at once, even if its early. You can save a lot of time this way.|`|tOdjjeAmaa	I agree with sheloves_dablues...<br>  <br>  She's absolutely right. If you both work full time, the housework and cooking are his responsibilities as well. When my husband has the day off and I'm cleaning, you better believe his butt is helping me!! He doesn't really mind it either... that's how it should be! And I'm a stay at home mom!! I get a lot done. I take care of things. But I probably wouldn't if I had a full time job and church meetings to study for as well!! My goodness. Make him do something to help. You don't have to shave yourself all the time if you don't want to. Sheesh.|`|T4N6a7MQaa	Dear child,<br>     Your husband is using you like yesterday's news. You work, he works. You keep the house, he plays. See a pattern here? Marriage is a 50/50 proposition. It's give and take. You're giving and he's taking in your case. Don't allow this any longer. And stop shaving your pubic hair. Women have pubic hair. Little girls do not. Which do you want to be?|`|c95b6cf1e21b1025509e8470848d6b6aaa	Life is full of choices. Choose the most important things to you and do them first. Personally, I know people obsessed with clean houses. They're children are afraid to play with their toys for fear of making a mess! My house is kept up, but by no means spotless. Laundry, once a week. He cooks more than I do. Shaving everyday?? Never gonna happen! Pick your battles.|`|PBOWJYQ6aa	We don't do all of that by ourselves. We tell them to help or get out. We let them know that we need a little "me time" so they need to pick up dinner. And when they are as selfish as yours, we starch their underwear!|`|ULUpOqplaa	You need to smack him in the head and tell him that it is an equal partnership and a free ride for him.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	I don't....my husband helps too. In a marriage both give 100%, and it appears that you are the only one giving 100%, and he is giving nothing.  <br>  <br>  You being so young you do not understand this.  I for one feel that you are too young to be married, and that your husband is controlling you. You will end up being unhappy, because who you really are will be lost, by being controlled.<br>  <br>  As far as spending time with his friends....tell him that you too would like to spend time with your friends as well, and that the only way to do this is if the 2 of you join efforts and share all the responsibilities of the home and other stuff.|`|OBCvewW2aa	I'm a single mother, I keep the house immaculate, I cook every night and I keep up with myself.  It's not so much a problem because no one is looking over my shoulder EXPECTING me to do all these things.  It's ok if I leave the house in a rush one morning and don't make the bed or (lucky me) forget to shave my legs.  Maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself.  Just because you're somebody's wife doesn't mean you have to morph into June Cleaver.  You're only 18, act it.  Have fun, enjoy your marriage and leave the bed unmade every once in a while.|`|hjc2y3TMaa	First of all, you are very young and very newly married. Usually you warm up to all those tasks, you don't just jump head first in to doing every single adult responsibility all by yourself. Especially as you are just transitioning from your own childhood and being within your parents home. I myself had quite a bit to learn before I could get any routines down. Yes, he needs to help. He needs to make dinner some nights, you may need to cut back on some things (such as church meetings) and tell yourself that you do not have to be perfect 100% of the time. I hope this helps but I have 3 children and I stay home and it's not always easy. I also find that there is a period of adjustment after each big change in life (or each child in my case) and it can take up to a year to get into a groove. you will find your pace and remove what you need to from your to-do list. BTW, married men don't need to leave you home to hang out with friends. That is the occasional night out for a FATHER or MOTHER not for a guy who just got married and has no kids. If he wants to be married and act grown-up then he needs to pull his own weight and be a good husband to you and be there for you at night and be there to make your marriage strong in the beginning like this.|`|z1C75GIaaa	They are called responsibilities, they come with the words "I do"  when you get married.... I can see how at 18 you would be overwhelmed. So, plan it out... Slow cooked meals are the best,  you can leave them cooking during the day while you are at work... Clean your house on Sat as suppose to everyday during the week, plus if both of you work and are never home, then it shouldn't be as dirty.  Pay your bills on line if you have the option, it's a time saver.... <br>  <br>  Oh, and a word of advise, don't have any babies until you have some type of system, if you are overwhelmed now, just wait until you are a parent.
ZIDLsJiDaa	It would be better and simpler to get married here then travel for your honeymoon. I'm married to a Brit (we got married in the US) and one of the reasons we married in the US was the process was much simpler.  In the UK the requirements and public notices were really more of a hassle than anything.  The waiting periods alone would easily be at least three weeks or so before you could even get married (Including a 7 day residency requirement needed in the days immediately before you register your intent to marry).  So unless you have a fair amount of vacation time available it's really not practical.  To see the legal guidelines check out the link below.  Enjoy a wedding with friends and family and have an awesome honeymoon anywhere you wish.|`|CkN4pgpCaa	In my opinion, you should marry in America and honeymoon in Europe.  While I don't think that everyone under the sun needs to be at your wedding, your family and close friends should be.  They might be really upset that they can't be a part of your big day without spending a fortune... and while you may have some really cool wedding pictures, you won't have your friends and family in them with you!  Or the memories of sharing the big day with them.  If you honeymoon in Europe, you can still see the sights, eat the food, and experience everything.. and have tons of awesome pictures and memories there with your new husband.  <br>  <br>  Just my opinion, but I think you'll be missing out on a lot by leaving out your family and friends.  But you should go with whatever you feel in your gut!|`|Drw4Gg1Daa	I suggest that make a pros/cons list for each choice.  How will you feel afterwards?  What's most important to you?  I knew that after the wedding day, I'd probably regret spending too much money, but I knew I wanted my friends and family there.  So I decided against my dream wedding, because it was just too much money (that I don't have).  I ended up planning a budget wedding for a quarter of the price (invited 100 people) and used the rest of our savings to buy a house where my husband and I can enjoy many years of our life together.  For me, our financial security and future was more important than a dream wedding.<br>  <br>  Either way, you should definitely go to Europe for your honeymoon.|`|YyiESOpFaa	if theres a way to have your closet family and friends come, then i say go for it.|`|CLdM1OsLaa	Yeah, its suppose to be your perfect moment why not.|`|LOMoovuqaa	Go with your dream wedding!

Follow your heart!|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	just have your honeymoon there.  a destination wedding to the UK is very $$$$ and you'd be cutting your friends and family out of it.|`|AA11312653	Parents are usually wanting to be involved in their children's weddings, to have a chance to "swan it up" and show off when their beautiful daughter or handsome son gets married. They won't be happy about it if you take their fun away from them. <br>  <br>  The honeymoon is about wallowing in an orgy of self indulgence, The wedding is about family and guests.|`|8arOL9Jdaa	Travel weddings are getting more popular, but by choosing the travel wedding you wave all rights to wedding gifts. However, a wedding here could be just as amazing because you will get to spend time with your friends and family. Additionally, wouldn't you want to travel for the honeymoon and not the wedding, it would make the travel for the honeymoon so much more meaningful.<br>  <br>  You also need to talk to the groom, is he very close to his family and friends? If so, he will probably want them to be at the wedding. So a travel wedding is still an option just think if it is actual feasible for family members to pay for the travel, and would you be ok without the wedding gifts that help a lot of couples acquire necessities in their first few years of marriage?<br>  <br>  To me, family is most important so I would stay at home and travel for the honeymoon, but that is my opinion. Best of luck and congratulations|`|AA11380378	I would rather have a nice wedding with my family in attendance and a luxurious, relaxed honeymoon, than a  wedding abroad, alone on a crappy hotel; but that's just me.<br>  <br>  Good luck<br>  <br>  PS/ Have a dream, not a nightmare|`|8cf66894663c74e69b5ed17db7228d97aa	Do what you want-actually, right now might be good in terms of cost-everyone is hurting and you could get some great prices. Runaway like an elopement and get married and honeymoon, then come home and celebrate in a fun reception with family and friends. I'm sure they would love to celebrate with you and you could get the best of both worlds.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Look into the realistic-ness of your dream wedding. Also, factor in that planning a destination is tough - let alone in another country! Sounds like a LOT more work. The compromise would be getting married here so everyone can be there and then have your honeymoon in Europe. Maybe years down the road, you could renew your vows in London!

Where does it state that women have to be asked by men? Take responsibility for what you need.<br>  <br>  If you're not wlling to ask, you have nothing to complain about. If two people really want to get married, they get married. It does not matter who does the proposing. Because people who are truly ready for marriage are already thinking in terms of "we" and not "him" and "me." Marriage is a natural step, it's an idea that just makes sense one day.<br>  <br>  If you are "anxiously" waiting and he's not delivering, it might be best to reexamine your relationship.

Make life without you a reality.  If he's REALLY that into you then he will do everything to win you - including a proposal.<br>  <br>  Move on, live your life, it's to Fing short to "WAIT" around for ANYBODY|`|1da4a2d0455c0102329b9db0565c3a34aa	You don't have to be the ones waiting to be asked.

Stay interested in your own life and pursuits, because when the marriage does happen, those will save you from being the lonely wife.|`|AA11447210	We don't "have" to wait, and you just made that point. If we (women in general) don't want to do it ourselves then we CHOOSE to wait for the guy to do it.<br>  <br>  You either make the move yourself, or choose to wait until he does. Maybe he's not ready...maybe he's not sure how you feel. <br>  <br>  Men don't always know when they are going to ask. It's a BIG deal to ask someone to legally bind themselves to you and share a significant portion of their life. It's a huge change from not being married and not as easy to end (as breaking up a non-married relationship) if things don't work out.<br>  <br>  Why not talk to him in general about the future...what does he want?

rQ7dI88Maa	First, talk about her. Everyone likes to talk about themselves. Compliment her on an outfit she's wearing. Write down and memorize some questions regarding stuff you have in common to talk about. Is their something newsworthy in your area? Chat about that.  As for losing weight, try to eat less and get more exercise. Don't sweat it. Most people are understanding when they see someone is nervous or shy. You'll do fine!|`|tkUCHhAdaa	U love a crush? let me guess, you stalk her, you have imaginary sex with her, and u smell a piece of her clothing that u stole from her before you go to sleep. <br>  <br>  Simply: <br>  1.)

Its not love, and if by chance, which is very slim, u ever get together, it will be ruined because u apparently have this visualization on how ur relationship will be withouteven knowing the person.<br>  3.)

If you don't talk to her much, you don't know her that well.  Major crush - yes, love - no.<br>  <br>  I'm not saying that to be mean, I am saying stop pressuring yourself over it right now.<br>  <br>  Just try to strike up a conversation with her, things like:<br>  <br>  - How are you today?<br>  - Did you have a nice weekend?<br>  <br>  Etc...easy simple things to get talking, and go from there.  Try not to let it fade out - try to find out something she likes or is interested in and chat about that.<br>  <br>  You may find that once you talk to her, you don't like her so much as you are too different etc.  Right now it seems you're basing this on her face and not who she is, so until you know her better - relax, breather and find out more about her.<br>  <br>  Love comes after that - but it's fun to get to that stage :-)<br>  <br>  Good luck - this is an enjoable stage of dating so go...enjoy!

He betrayed you broke your trust and hurt you beyond belief.<br>  <br>  Why did you take him back?

If your boyfriend left you, then it was likely for one of two reasons: Either the relationship was becoming stale because there was not enough of you in it, or the relationship was getting too claustrophobic because there was too much of you in it. Either way, one of these causes is going to lead to relationship suicide. If you are asking "How can I get back together with my ex boyfriend", then you need to start looking at which of these led to the break up so you can act accordingly. <br>  <br>  Whatever the issue is that chiefly contributed to the split, it was probably either something that you did, or something that you didn't do. It may be harsh to look at things this way, but that is simply how it usually works. The person who was broken up with either did, or did not do something and the person doing the splitting simply felt driven away. So now what happens, and how can you manage to get him to come back? The first step is to change whatever it was that drove him away in the first place. <br>  <br>  Check out the article below, "How To Make My Ex Boyfriend Want Me Back".|`|TGfwEtUPaa	Best way to get revenge...

O8TA4tMGaa	I really have to speak to you on this one because I've lived your exact situation and I'm a life coach so let me get straight to the point:<br>  <br>  Maya Angelou has a very important saying, "When someone shows you who they are, believe them!" <br>  <br>  I'm reading your post and I see that you are doing all you can to move out of his parents' house, that you moved into his parents house with the clear understanding that this would be short term and that you would only be doing this for a couple months so you can get back on your feet and be on your own.  That's what any married person wants: to live independently, to create their own family.<br>  <br>  The problem here is that your husband is now living with "his" parents and he's comfortable; obviously he would be; they are his parents but the bottom line is this: he didn't marry his parents; he married you and his commitment needs to be to you and your family (whether you have children or not is irrelevant- you two are a family).  In a marriage, you honor each other's feelings and if you're trying to move, trying to discuss moving, and wanting to move because of how uncomfortable you feel, shouldn't he be doing everything in his power to work with you to make that happen?  Of course he should!<br>  <br>  Now, remember what I said in the beginning; you don't go by what people tell you.  You go by what they do and, from his actions, I'm guessing he's really comfortable in the current situation.  He doesn't want to move.  If you go by what he says and not by what he does, that  one's on you so start going by his actions, not his words.<br>  <br>  The next point on this: <br>  What do you want?  Really, really ask that question.  What's in your best interest?  Yes, this is a marriage.  Yes, this is a partnership but it's not a complete partnership when you're miserable and he's not recognizing it or caring enough about your misery to work with you to make a change.  You have to love you enough to do what's best for you and hope that he'll choose to partner up with you in the end to build a life together.  <br>  <br>  Trust me when I say that in-law problems only get bigger with time.  Trust me when I tell you that if he's choosing his family over you now, the likelihood that that's going to change is very small.  And believe me when I tell you that by accepting this kind of behavior now, you are setting the tone for what you're willing to accept later.<br>  <br>  We teach people how to treat us.  What are you teaching him, in your actions, about how to treat you?  Are you standing firm on your conviction to move?  Are you making it clear that you need your own home and your own private space?  Are you doing whatever it takes (if that means you work 2 jobs) to make that happen so you two can afford to do it on your own?  This is your work and you need to  make sure that you aren't sending him the wrong signals.  This is not the time to waver.  We teach people how to treat us.<br>  <br>  The bottom line: life is too short to spend even one more second being miserable.  If you love him and he loves you and you two are committed to creating a life together, there has to be a part of both of you that comes together and figures out how to move out of his parents' house.  If there's not willingness on both sides to make this work, that's a whole other conversation.|`|5mTKspfYaa	sounds like you may have made a bad decsion, so so sorry.

Learning to communicate is tricky because everyone has a different personality and way of reacting.  My husband and I had a situation in our marriage that when I brought it up he would change the subject and not talk about it.  (We've only been married 10 months, so, it was early on too.)  I finally got so mad that we had a yelling match.  No fun, but some concerns of his came out.  I was mad, but over that week I thought about some of the things he said and didn't bring up the topic for a month.  Finally, we were out to dinner and I said here is my outlook on this topic, (he had to hear me out at a restraunt), I see where you are coming from with this and this that you said in our fight a while ago.  I am going to continue to talk about this topic because it is important to me and we have to talk to stay marired and make decisions together.  If we can't then we have a bigger problem...<br>  <br>  Somehow you have to get his thoughts out in the open.  Maybe some of them are valid.  He's probably afraid of how you are going to react.  Don't be offended by that...you have the right to react. haha!  Just get his thoughts out there even if you have to get him to yell them!  It is better than not knowing what he is thinking and why he isn't interested in moving.  Maybe he fears he won't be able to support you and give you all the things you want.  It could be something as simple (and kind of sweet) as that.  Men sometimes need to be reassured themselves.<br>  <br>  Push some more before you call it quits!|`|djUMvICoaa	I don't think you are fighting your husband as much as you are fighting his parents who have a lot of input into what he does or people he likes.  But he is playing it out like you said, it will be his excuse for everything.  What you should do is get an apartment, get out of his parents house now.  It will be his decision to either follow you or not.  At least an apartment will let you get some breathing room and not tie you down to a long term contract that you may have trouble committing to.  If by chance he follows, make sure that he is going forward with you, that he is involved with what is going on.  If he puts up any resistance from there I think you will be better off without him.  You don't have a scissors big enough to cut his apron strings.  good luck|`|YNDMwFEJaa	Just tell him either we go look for a place of our own or i will good look for a place by myself,cuz im not going to be treated this way by your parents.|`|cGbTJobeaa	A few things.....welcome to the first year of marriage.

Be confident and sound happy, be willing to help people. <br>  Most importantly be yourself!<br>  <br>  Try not to go to loud crowded places to meet people. <br>  What sort of things are you interested in?<br>  <br>  For instance if its music, go to music stores, go to a gig and talk to people before you go in and so on...|`|Hp18CSwLaa	clubs, bars, and pubs are always the easiest, but since that's not your thing, you could try doing some volunteer work. that way you can meet some people. you can also try going to church/prayer meetings if you're really desperate.<br>  <br>  other good places are bookstores, parks, coffee shops, and the gym.<br>  <br>  there's facebook and myspace if you're into that whole meeting new people online kinda thing.<br>  <br>  oh here's a crazy idea: join help groups like alcoholics anonymous and sexaholics anonymous. you can meet people that way too:D|`|jztZxJ5paa	well you can do wat everyone does try to get a job and go to the my space or you could find friends wright here just try and you will find a friend maybe even right here|`|sTMvGD8Kaa	the bar don't drink soak up the vibe and move on if it ain't right you soon find soles|`|Vrdi2gL6aa	facebook<br>  myspace<br>  mylivejornal<br>  a park|`|fJQsSF3Naa	Here?|`|GhLEsDwwaa	myspace.com =]
ZxV8FeiYaa	I;m not sure what grade your in but your basically describing an 7th grade version of me!...<br>  yes, this girl likes you!<br>  she might be mentioning her boyfriend to see your reaction,<br>  if you like her as well then ask her out, don't ask if she likes you because you heard or thought she did, just ask her out, any other way will get her acting weird or offended.<br>  if you don't like her then just don't say anything, she'll soon get over her crush and won't get as hurt as she would if she thought everyone in the school knows about it!<br>  <br>  please listen to my advice, I've been that girl so many times lol|`|dHDe64FUaa	She likes you, and nervous around you.|`|V6dz395kaa	I think she's nervous if her bf is gonna find out and get mad at u. But, she still really likes u. ;) You should really ask her out or something b4 she just totally forgets about u.|`|d5sAojVmaa	I'm not sure why should would act this way. Some people aren't getting what they need out of a relationship so they decide to try with someone else. Or she could just be a flirt who knows. I think the fact that you told her that you knew about her relationship scared her because maybe it was easier for her when she thought you didn't know and she felt like maybe when she was flirting with you that she wasn't being true to the person she is actually with. Talk!|`|tkUCHhAdaa	You creepy, weirdo, you saw something that was never there, she was just being nice to you, probably because she felt bad for you; you must be a "loser". If you want to avoid a possible order of protection against you, avoid her at all cost, you'll be doing everyone a favor.|`|SqDXxAeGaa	she sit and talk to you again, it'll take a while she's probably confused because she likes you but with the boyfriend at home just give it a while and she'll come around|`|5es7ct2Baa	ASK HER OUT NOW|`|Hu8sz5rmaa	You know that is a little weird, but i think shes just as confused as you are. Maybe she really likes you and the fact that you know she has a boyfriend frustrates her. Maybe she texted you saying she needs more time because shes trying to figure out if she wants to break up with her boyfriend so she can be with you. And the whole starring thing is probably done with her not even realizing shes doing it. If she never does change or do anything then maybe you should just forget her.|`|NrmdwT8Baa	Unfortunately if she likes you being just friends is difficult. If you like her back then you need to tell her you like her as well. Long distant relationships rarely work especially for people 18 or under. But if you like her then you need to confess what do you have to loose? You don't really have to go out yet but at least let her know your interested. But friendship is only more painful and it will end badly...<br>  <br>  Oh and i agree with hazel eyes...you could have scared her...|`|JnlYIzwdaa	ok my opinion...<br>  i think shes trying to decide who she wants....<br>  if shes akward and wont talk she prob needs time to know who she really likes!<br>  maybe she liked you and thought you didnt and she just kept it at her bf level and now that you told her you liked her maybe shes thinking if he likes me ad i like him....<br>  what can i do... should i leave my bf.. for a guy i really like and love to hang out with!?<br>  maybe! <br>  Hope all goes well|`|1Jh6nvIzaa	she's probably embarrassed that you told her that you think she likes you.. she'll come around, just give her time.. it seems to me that she's trying to break an attachment.. she might be trying to stop liking you other than a friend..she'll come around dont worry..|`|GhLEsDwwaa	she has a boyfriend.....and it is long distnace...but it sounds to me like she thinks your cute...but because she has a boyfriend there is nothing you can really do about it right now. let her make that choice. until then...good luck=]|`|YZafHtVKaa	she is verry biuty|`|MeOG2TPHaa	hey.<br>  i can sort of understand this kind of girl coz im not too different. but i think its like you said. she does like you, she doesnt talk about her boyf, coz shes enjoying the conversation that she is having with you and talking about him will lose the interest in the moment. i believe she is definalty interested in you and she has demonstrated this. After you told her how you think she likes you, its awkward, for many reasons, yo have both confronted the situation and whats developing. she is not sitting next to you etc, because, of the guilt about her boyfirend, and now that she likes you, and its too much at the moment. she most probably in a dillema, should she leave her BF, and get with you? or not? or be only your friend? has her feelings changed now that she likes you? are you a crush? etc...thats why she needs the time, to evaluate where she is at and how she is feeling! <br>  <br>  the hot and coldness she is giving out towards you, is just confusion and indecisiveness. but if she is STILL staring at you like this, its coz she does still like you. has a soft spot for you. so give her time, carry on as normal as you can. when she is ready hopefully she will let you know. if she dosent, then ask her again. but he caring when you ask dont presure her. but make sure you tell her you want to know soon coz you have to get on with your life and it will be unfair on you. <br>  <br>  so i hope it works out! <br>  <br>  tc<br>  <br>  peace! :)
HvbIE03saa	I'm with Maandpas...you were the one that put yourself in this spot. You decided to try to trick your parents, so they reacted appropriately. If you want to screw something else out then sure, sneak out and meet him...you'll probably miss out on something else you want to do when they find out. <br>  <br>  Or you can act like an adult, take the punishment and earn back their trust so you can continue to do the things you want to do.<br>  <br>  Kudos to your parents for acting like parents and keeping an eye out for you.|`|0d7c42bc05e5b089e4e0d1fe9ce315a8aa	It would be nice to have an age???<br>  But, if you are under 18 and living at home....you don't go you have to live with their rules.  Sorry.  My daughter feels same way.  Well, until she graduates high school and moves out on her own, She still has rules and no road trips with boyfriend unless it is a day thing.  And I know who is going, and where and what time leave and be back.  <br>  The only worry about your safety.  If you keep sneaking around it will get worse for you, dishonesty is not good with parents.  If they can't trust you, how will they every learn to let go.|`|LJ2OqF1saa	You are not going to convince her to let you go.....you were in the wrong.  If you wanted to go, then you should have not been deceitful.  Now you have caused your parents not to trust you......you are given trust, you earn it, so you will have to earn it back, and it will take some time.  You knew what you did was wrong, and if found out .... you would suffer consequences, in which you are.  Stop gripping about it, because you chose this, by not being deceitful.|`|QJslTCUBaa	Smart mom. :-)|`|tzy4kOEraa	sneak out and tell ya bf to meet you|`|1zvRAAl0aa	Tell her you could phone back a few times to let her know you are alright, or do a few chores letting her know you have some responsibility for yourself.
lFIuF9wZaa	I'm 37 dating a 27 y/o...it only matters if it matters to you...|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Sounds good to me, if you like this person then go for it honey.|`|eKuvx6f8aa	I think it's fine if you are happy w/him and the age difference has not caused any negative issues. I would suggest however,that you not jump into marriage quickly-i would suggest a long courtship first just to make sure that there won't be any issues on down the line.|`|sgRDJUXqaa	No, but you need to think about your life goals if you want this relationship to be long-term.  Do you want to get married and have children?  Does he?  Right now, he is at an age where a long-term commitment is probably on his mind (unless he's a playboy), so would you be ready to get married in a couple of years?<br>  <br>  I don't think 10 years is too big of an age difference, but you're both at different points in your life.  He's done playing around and probably wants to settle down; you are still working out your career and life goals.  Will he wait for you, or will you be ready for him?  Think about those things.  Age itself doesn't matter.|`|rI7J9M8taa	That's about the same age difference as my husband and I and we have been happily married for over thirty years.  Go for it!|`|QK7ssy2Xaa	Nah age is just a number. 10 years isn't that bad. As long as your happy and he treats you like a princess. It's not bad having an older guy anyway, bypass all those games.|`|CnHYgd7baa	way 2 big of an age gap|`|KHJ6zzp4aa	Nope i know someone who is 36 and dating a 23 year old and lots of other people with the age differencr doesnt reallly matter|`|xKgZAp1Oaa	I know it sounds cliche, but age is just a number.|`|kckLAUzhaa	no its a totally fine age difference|`|6XKlW3lyaa	Nope.  For a 33 year old, as long as your out of college, i'd say that your in the same category.|`|ky82orBzaa	wtf does it matter if you love him? Forget what others think and just get it on!!!!|`|deZArjX7aa	I completely agree with PerfectVelvet. As long as he's willing to wait for you to figure your life out, then go for it.|`|GTAbs48Eaa	yes 10 years to to much, keep it to the most 4 years|`|QUmqfjSuaa	girl you are grown, do you :].|`|qHvXt8zMaa	My perspective is that is bit more than the average couple but its fine by me and who whats to be average.<br>  <br>  Defintly not to big of a difference if you to get along and like each other then thats all matters is you two been together.|`|1Jh6nvIzaa	i dont see anything wrong with the age difference.. i know a couple that has a 19 yr age difference and they've been married for about 30 years..|`|Mm5NsrF8aa	yes and no...he is in a different place in life...I think at 23 you still have so much more to experience with someone closer to your age|`|XAkLPdhqaa	That's not a big age difference at all. If you have the right person, what is the big deal?
nYEwK5FNaa	Maybe its not them you're so horribly judgemental! You have never even talked to them and you can say all these hateful things about them! If you live in America LEAVE we need to get all the SHALLOW people out of this country. It's disgusting.|`|QUmqfjSuaa	yessssss godd.|`|tkUCHhAdaa	oh yeah, that a brilliant idea, they will definitely talk to you , especially if they speak another language,.....being sarcastic.|`|Hu8sz5rmaa	umm okay............. if you have another country to go to go for it. But its not worth leaving you family and friends for a girl.|`|kckLAUzhaa	yessss|`|j6jmzHSvaa	Where is your country? Depends!!|`|f8GW80mfaa	noooooooooooo
YiA8Pe0Vaa	Partner?<br>  <br>  Significant Other?<br>  <br>  Ha boyfriend or girlfriend isn't juvenile at all, why does it matter?<br>  <br>  Commitmate?<br>  WHAT?!?<br>  <br>  No offence, but I really doubt that will take on.<br>  Y'alright mate? <br>  Well, DEFINITELY less juvenile than BF/GF ;)|`|vSHkZWUoaa	yes|`|7ocvtrZnaa	That sounds pretty stupid if you ask me.
D4jZM26Paa	Yes, I assume the proposal for marriage is more important than a piece of metal to go on your finger.|`|76f80c73e4bfcb1026dd5ae2d1da3f18aa	no.  the ring symbolizes both committment and financial stability.  don't make any plans until you have some type of ring, doesn't have to be huge and fancy and expensive, it just shows he can prioritize his finances and that he values the relationship.|`|0F8hauikaa	It's not so much about the ring as if he is financially stable. If he bought a ring and you said no, then he would not get back the full amount he paid for it, so perhaps he's just being practical, which is a good quality. And maybe he would like to know what ring would suit you best, which would be considerate, yet another good quality. If neither of you are finacially stable, you should probably wait until you are, unless you're willing to do without a ring and other things you might want or need. Love can be wonderful, but unfortunately it doesn't pay the bills. Good luck with whatever you decide.|`|a6f8IoISaa	YES! If you love him it doesn't matter if he has a ring or not.|`|26cae2932c19d290ec2e4570f9542e0baa	You are shallow if you think that you must have a ring in order to be engaged. The ring is just the outward material symbol and has nothing to do with the commitment itself. Not to mention, countless women were married and engaged in past generations without rings of any kind (even wedding rings) and they took it seriously.|`|9fDkrrFyaa	If he had the ring, that meant he had taken the time to think about it for sometime. Selecting a ring is very intricate (he has to know what appeals to you) and planning the proposal too.<br>  <br>  He could have done better, personally i would not take it serious.<br>  But only you can decide if he is being genuine about it.|`|697ae04db2502a1d77e3c8fb84237406aa	When husband asked me to marry him, it was online, lol.  He took a zip tie and put it around his finger and i used a caterpillar sticker.  it was so sweet & romantic....i'll never forget it.  whatever your boyfriend does, if you feel special & honored by his "request for your hand" then thats between the 2 of you.  if you don't feel it for whatever reason, he didn't do it right; ring or not.|`|q8eue7CRaa	Did he talk about getting a ring for you? Was it said at the heat of the moment? And how old are you?|`|8e35cfeded3c3b900607388410347b4caa	Insufficient information.   Depends on the couple, their personalities, and the nature of the relationship.<br>  <br>  Back in the day,  I asked her, then took her shopping for the ring a few days later.  We're both practical and frugal.  I didn't want to spend a lot of money on a design she didn't like or get something she wasn't happy with for some reason.<br>  <br>  To this day, we're careful not to spring big surprise purchases on each other.    Even after this amount of time, tastes and preferences are not all that predictable for either of us.|`|ky3B42f6aa	If all that you are worried about is a ring, I don't think HE should take you at all.|`|Z3Mv1pxaaa	no not till you see the ring and tell him that|`|AA11447210	We don't know him, you do. A ring is just a symbol, it's not a requirement for marriage.<br>  <br>  Only you can decide if you think he's serious...or why not ask him if he's serious and if so, will you be marrying with or without a ring?|`|zwJbUbWMaa	Well it depends on how old you are (meaning you aren't a couple of 15 year olds), how long you have been together, and how serious the relationship is.|`|yMTCaB8qaa	depends if you REALLY like him and if he's REALLY serious but also funny in it! lol! and just accept it if you want to! i mean, do u REALLY like him?!?!?!?!|`|AA11380378	No.<br>  <br>  A man without a ring, three things come to mind: cheap and broke, immature teenager, wants to get on youu pants or all of the above.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	Yes,he probably can't afford one,ask him why he doesn't have a ring and you'll get your answer.|`|0b4b73030990eeb19bdc09b4a63e6cb7aa	Do him.|`|ZYCYiTT7aa	Yes!|`|bzgo59anaa	I think that all depends on how he asked. Did he get on one knee? (which of course is not a requriment) Did he say it while he was farting? like "hey ya want to marry me now?" or did he honestly speak the words from his heart? If you want to know what I think its this...... you must know deep down wether he was being seious or not. the question is wether you WANT to take him seriously.... and than my suggestion is this, if the answer is yes (although this may be hard) ask him!!! if your ready to spend the rest of your lives together you should have no problem settling for a cheap ring or no ring at all because if he cant afford a ring, Im sure there are other things you cant afford also, there will be times you go without that new pair of jeans you despreatly want or those high heels you would die for.<br>  and if you love him enough to settle for that tell him, let him know if he was serious, than love is what matters. (as long as thats how you feel)|`|V6dz395kaa	wow, um, yea. Congrats!|`|n6IBfiDPaa	Yes! The ring doesn't mean anything.<br>  Im sure he will get you a ring in time, maybe he is strapped for cash at the moment, but still wants to marry you.<br>  A ring doesn't mean he loves you any more. Its just a symbol.<br>  Him putting himself out there and asking you to marry him shows that he loves you.<br>  Def. take him seriously. He wouldnt ask you unless he was serious|`|lpeHQj3aaa	it depends? do you love him? do you know his financial situation?  have you discussed marriage before?<br>  <br>  it doesn't mean if a man didn't have a ring at hand when he asked you to marry him - that his not taking all this seriously.<br>  <br>  marriage is a pretty serious business for a man.|`|ajTo21jNaa	ring just an object!<br>  he loves you so much and can't live without you so he wants to marry you even you have hula hoops crisps ring or can ring!<br>  the matter of fact that he loves you and want to be with you rest of your both life with or without the ring!!|`|91f956efb63a51bcca06586fcc2fe99aaa	a ring or not do you love him and want to marry him? maybe he just doesn't have the money right now. if you love him a ring shouldn't matter. im married and only wear one ring. i wanted my engagement ring to also be my wedding ring. as long as you know your engaged or married then thats all that matters|`|hcpgD6hBaa	Yes, it depends on you. If you really love him, you can accept to marry him. Take him seriously, good luck to you.|`|TZWkf59Daa	if he was serious when he asked and did he say you will get a ring?<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlXbVwhCoS1mkvnU62jtJarty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&show=7#profile-info-2zumgG7taa">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a><br>  <br>  please answer!|`|2hcA3VP9aa	Yes, he probally wanted to wait so he could have you fitted for the ring to make sure that it is the right size.|`|6XKlW3lyaa	If hes at least 18... yes.  No one has money for the same kind of rings our parents have anymore.  And if its been running around in his head and it just came out... its probably because he couldnt hold it in any longer.|`|IVjOPymhaa	yes i am sure your not measuring your love or his by a ring.maybe he has his own way of asking you to marry him.everyone never does the same way .|`|Bf8PVFSSaa	it's not about the ring, it is about the man. If you are more interested in jewelry, then he should dump your a**<br>  <br>  Eat Funyuns.|`|iqsnt85Saa	the guy im with asked me to marry him w/out a ring.  i said yes and then he saved up and bought me one about a month later. If you think hes being for real about it then yes take him seriously. but you know him better than we do so only you can tell if he means it. but before you both go rushing into talk about it first and everything you both will want out of the engagement and the marriage that should fallow. make sure you both understand and know what the other wants and how they feel about it because you may have dif ideas on what it should be.|`|iF1ZCcYEaa	If he's crazy enough to do it without a ring, he loves you.|`|6dc34c97f58bec65f5badda7c239a77daa	If he is asking you than he is obviously ready to settle down. Regardless if there is a ring or not you should definitely take him seriously if you want to marry him. We are all in an economic crunch so sometimes things like a ring might have to wait for a bit. The ring is just a symbol, but as long as you love each other, that is all you need.|`|CsfskhO1aa	Depends on your situation<br>  the Economy sucks, <br>  and the only reason you want a ring is because, society says<br>  "a ring means your married"<br>  No, love means your married<br>  so, if he is low on money<br>  and was very sincere, a ring is materialistic<br>  but love is not<br>  so, eventually... you wil get a ring<br>  so yes... you should take him seriously <br>  but if he just said it casualy, while eating pizza<br>  give it some thought|`|uszV7NEFaa	If you love him you won't care. Did he say that he's planning to get one in the future?|`|j5vHW6wMaa	well, how about being practicall for a moment, if he's not prepared with a ring for a proposal, what makes you think he will be prepared for a committed marriage, if he cant afford a ring, what makes you think he can afford a wife let alone an entire family. i mean yes its every girls fantasy when she is proposed to but usually in the dream the guy has a ring. dont let your emotions overide the practical reality that this guy is probably a deadbeat if he doesnt have a ring|`|qRIMM2ycaa	I don't know, maybe you should ask him?<br>  <br>  Diamond rings have only been a tradition since the 1930's, and the tradition was started be DaBeers, so whether or not a ring is actually important or not, is entirely up to you and your boyfriend.|`|jCeylLsIaa	Kayla, what were you thinking of, girl? You're not marrying the ring! There's only one way to find out...drag him to the nearest church and tell him to put his money where his mouth is.<br>  <br>  Seriously...never ever forget..."wedding" is just an event...and "marriage" -- a sacrament.|`|5sq8vqQIaa	Of course, are you about him or the ring?  a hundred reasons why he might not have a ring.|`|KtK1dEu1aa	I would say yes. He could have been being spontaneous. Although if he makes excuses to why he doesn't have a ring after a while, thats when i'd start asking questions.
a984cQjKaa	you shall mind your own business is what you shall do.  it has nothing to do with you, so stay out of it.  if they're happy together  and they're good to each other and they get tested to make sure they don't pass on anything to their children, should they marry, then who are you to say what they can or can't do?<br>  EDIT: oh, and the bible doesn't say anything about a prohibition on first cousins getting married.|`|vSHkZWUoaa	let them|`|eWObKmBSaa	Back off, if you have talked with them, they won't listen.  Well, sounds like you tried and you can't make them split.  Blood relatives is real bad on the babies.  Back off and let them be.  DO, not give them hope, relatives have defective babies, same genes.
