94MyeH19aa	just google area of a trapezium and area of a rhombus, and the area of a hexagon and triangle, not hard if you have a formula, lol i cant remember what they are though. then you can work out which answer's right with the area that you got
AA10927246	You picked the correct formula (the first one).<br>  <br>  However, you've got one slight error.  A fifth of 20% is 4% per period.<br>  0.2/5 = 0.04 (not 0.004).<br>  <br>  So you should have:<br>  $1000 * (1.04)^15<br>  = 1 800.94351<br>  <br>  Rounding to the nearest whole cent:<br>  = $1,800.94<br>  <br>  P.S.  One could way to catch an error like this is to perform a "sanity" check.  If the annual rate is 20%, then you would make at least $200 in the first year, even if you didn't compound.  Just using simple interest that would be $1600 after 3 years.  With compounding 5 times a year it has to be more than that.  Thus $1,800.94 makes sense,  while $1,061.71 does not.|`|DzUxBehhaa	it is nt and not n+t and yes, you did it right.
XKhNw221aa	because all electrons have negative charges, and negatives repulse negatives (magnetically), at a subatomic level we actually never touch anything. cool huh.|`|GpNTIGAdaa	there made up of rando stuff|`|SDP4qopIaa	Here is a cool one for ya.  You never actually touch anything.  Like when you are typing.  The electrons in your finger tips repel the electrons in the keyboard keys.  The part of the atom that contains mass, the nucleus, never touches another nucleus.   Except in nuclear fusion and alpha particles.  But everywhere else in the universe, the electromagnetic force between atoms keeps the nucleus's from ever touching.|`|jbNYyB3Jaa	OK number one:<br>  1) you never touch anything. Blah blah, these guys already pointed that out, the surface of your body is made up of electrons (usually) which repel other electrons, and your muscles are not strong enough to overcome this repulsion (neither are the atoms). This is why your hand never passes through your door handle like a ghost.<br>  <br>  2) atoms are not the smallest particles in the universe. Atoms are made up of subatomic particles (protons, electrons, neutrons...). They are not the smallest particles in the universe either as they are made up of sub-subatomic particles such as quarks. I don't know of anything below quarks.<br>  <br>  3) if you take an electron from an atom or lend it an extra electron, it becomes an ion (which is a fancy name for a charged atom). Some ions are made of several atoms bonded to each other. Ions are not molecules in their own right. Add two ions together and you get a compound (Such as Na+ and Cl- to make NaCl - Sodium(/Natrium) Chloride - table salt. There are many salts and they are largely inedible.<br>  <br>  4) f you give or take a proton from an atom it becomes a completely different substance. in fact this is how nuclear bombs and nuclear power plants work.<br>  <br>  5) atoms do different things depending on how you look at them and measure them. Have you heard of the "double slit experiement"? If you ever study optics in school or anything like that, ask your science teacher if they can show you. Light produces interference patterns because it is made of waves. However light can be made up of particles instead of waves. Similarly, electrons, protons, even whole atoms and molecules can be made of waves and NOT particles, if you measure the right properties. This is not a quirk of human perception, it's the duality of all matter.<br>  <br>  6) Electrons are not "balls" and are not "lumpy things".  In science class you may be lead to believe that electrons (the atom's usual negative constituents) are like little balls flying around the atoms. This is generally untrue. An electron exists in many points around the atom simultaneously, and is more like a standing wave of probability around the atom than it is like an actual discrete particle. Even the Lewis diagram, an invaluable tool for learning about chemistry, is kind of misleading when it comes to the nature of the actual atom and electon.<br>  <br>  7) for each subatomic particle there is an equivalent "antiparticle". That's right, there is such a thing as antimatter in the real world. If matter and antimatter collide, both are annihilated.<br>  <br>  8) Matter (atoms) can not be created or destroyed. The can be transformed and moved a thousand different ways, but never really destroyed. Ultimately, if the universe is only "so big", then based on what information we have now it will always weigh approximately the same. (This is due to the first law of thermodynamics, which CAN possibly be violated as with say for example Hawking Radiation)<br>  <br>  9) You can sometimes know things about an atom that you've never measured, by knowing things about an atom that you are measuring. Quantum entanglement allows a particle to be opposite to its partner, no matter how far they drift apart.<br>  <br>  10) It's possible that atoms do not strictly exist when you're not looking at them (Can't find a source, memory fails. Look at Schroedinger's Cat and Wavefunction Collapse for a hint on how this could happen)<br>  <br>  11) the wires in your computer conduct electricity in part because they are lattices of atoms, and each atom can pass a electron on to the next atom down the wire.<br>  <br>  12) The first man to split the atom was a scientist from New Zealand called Ernest Rutherford. One of the heavier atoms is named in his honour. Rutherford believed that we would never be able to do some of the things that we are able to do today, and yet we do them anyway.<br>  <br>  13) You can change the properties of atoms today, after you lose them tomorrow. Retroactively. How atoms behave now depends as much on what you do tomorrow as on what you do now.<br>  <br>  14) In certain conditions, atoms can flow up and out of their containers despite density and gravity.<br>  <br>  15) Atoms are always warm. Atoms can't be without heat, and their temperature can't be zero degrees kelvin. So there is a limit to how cold you can go. Interestingly, if you have a negative temperature in Kelvins, then heat will flow OUT of you, making you for practical purposes extremely hot. Negative Kelvin temperatures show a greater than infinite temperature.<br>  <br>  <br>  So in summary, atoms don't need to go anywhere near each other to affect each other. Indeed they can't without being transformed into something completely different (as in a Neutron Star, Quark Star or Black Hole). Atoms are affected by our minds as much as anything else. Atoms can be distorted beyond reason both in time and space by our and their perspective (whoops, no source).

Period.<br>  <br>  Aspirin has anti-platelet properties which (in part, and as it pertains to "heart health") prevents or lessens plaques forming in blood vessels.  Just like platelets clump together at the site of a wound of your skin, they can clump together at a cut in your blood vessel, forming a plaque.  These plaques can get dislodged and get stuck in the artery, preventing blood flow.  This prevents blood from carrying oxygen to the other vessels and tissue in the body.  When these tissues are not supplied with blood, they can die.  This is called ischemia or a myocardial infarction (heart attack).|`|5dxjJppsaa	Aspirin is an anti-platelet drug that makes the blood thinner.

bxxmaycraa	If you simply want to do mechanical design using the software developed by others, you won't need a higher education in software engineering.  If you want to give the greatest leverage to applied mechanical engineering, mastering software engineering at the highest level possible for your abilities and time and money resources is vital.<br>  <br>  The greatest advances in applied mechanical engineering in the last 50 years have been in computer simulation.  Today, one can visually reproduce the finished product, any or all of its component parts, vary their sizes and/or shapes, rotate the structure to any desired position in any desired sequence, place stresses and/or strains as desired during the process, and essentially test the structure to failure by changing the transfer functions of the elements in response to these stresses and/or strains.  One can then relate the transfer functions to the cost of materials for the components, and/or the cost of their manufacture.  In this way, one can design for optimal effectiveness of performance in the field in the sense of an optimal and cost effective manufacturing process.<br>  <br>  Think the above through for a bit, and you can see that as computers increase in complexity and power, the software engineer who can work within a strong team of other engineers to extend the increased computational power to engineers in a simple, applied fashion will be leveraging his own efforts through their combined efforts to satisfy new or more complex marketing needs.<br>  <br>  Fascinating, isn't it?
VPhYOWxwaa	Because the entry and exit surfaces of the slab are parallel.

2lQ8DJAcaa	Welcome to Vredefort, a real Bermuda Triangle<br>  <br>   It's like being in the Bermuda Triangle," says Rodger Hart of the iThemba Laboratory for Accelerator Based Science in South Africa. The location is the center of the Vredefort Crater, about 100 kilometers southwest of Johannesburg. Vredefort is the oldest and largest impact remnant on the planet, created about two billion years ago when a 10-kilometer-wide asteroid slammed into the earth. Evidence of older collisions exists elsewhere, in South Africa and in Western Australia, but in those cases no geologic structure has survived the ravages of time.<br>  <br>  Vredefort itself is not obviously a crater to the untrained eye. Geologists estimate the total crater size at 250 to 300 kilometers across, but the rim has long since been eroded away. The most obvious structure remaining is the Vredefort Dome, which is the crater's "rebound peak"--where deep rocks rose up in the crater's center after the impact. <br>  <br>       According to Hart, the probable source of Vredefort's weird magnetism was a strong and chaotic magnetic field generated by currents flowing in the ionized gases produced at the height of the collision. Laboratory experiments confirm that impacts cause intense magnetic fields in that fashion. Scientists have calculated that a mere one-kilometer-wide asteroid, one tenth the size of Vredefort's, would create a field 1,000 times that of the earth's at a distance of 100 kilometers. Vredefort's intense but random magnetism was not apparent from aerial surveys. Those analyses showed anomalously low magnetism over the crater, like a hole punched in the prevailing magnetic field. All the magnetic madness on the ground averages out to nothing when seen from too high up. <br>  <br>  The results could have implications not only for earth geology but also for studies of Mars. The immense Martian basins Hellas and Argyre displayed virtually no magnetism when measured by the orbiting Mars Global Surveyor. The conventional explanation runs like this: When these craters formed around four billion years ago, the impacts wiped out the preexisting magnetization of the rocks. Therefore, at the time of their creation Mars must not have had a magnetic field, because that field would have been preserved in the magnetization of the basins' rocks when they cooled. Mars does not now have a magnetic field, but long ago it did. Thus, the standard explanation implies that Mars lost its field very early on. <br>  <br>  Back on earth, Hart has proposed a high-resolution helicopter survey of Vredefort's magnetism, from an altitude low enough to see the magnetic variations. That would produce a complete magnetic map--and make some sense of the crater's weirdness.|`|6e8af9deff7a2588bb4959771651cb16aa	Mike Phillips, aged 36, a student of Remote Sensing at the Medway University Campus in Kent, used satellite imagery and image analysis software to conduct the first accurate surface measurement of the world’s oldest impact crater, which is sited 120 km south-west of Johannesburg in South Africa.<br>  <br>  He travelled to South Africa to examine them on the ground, under the supervision of a local expert on the geology of Vredefort, Dr Rodger Hart of the South African Council for Geoscience.

nTKuRFlKaa	*Alloying one metal with other metal(s) or non metal(s) often enhances its properties. For instance, steel is stronger than iron, its primary element. The physical properties, such as density, reactivity, Young's modulus, and electrical and thermal conductivity, of an alloy may not differ greatly from those of its elements, but engineering properties, such as tensile strength and shear strength may be substantially different from those of the constituent materials. This is sometimes due to the sizes of the atoms in the alloy, since larger atoms exert a compressive force on neighboring atoms, and smaller atoms exert a tensile force on their neighbors, helping the alloy resist deformation. Alloys may exhibit marked differences in behavior even when small amounts of one element occur. For example, impurities in semi-conducting ferromagnetic alloys lead to different properties, as first predicted by White, Hogan, Suhl, Tian Abrie and Nakamura.<br>  <br>  -Unlike pure metals, most alloys do not have a single melting point. Instead, they have a melting range in which the material is a mixture of solid and liquid phases. The temperature at which melting begins is called the solidus and the temperature when melting is complete is called the liquidus. However, for most alloys there is a particular proportion of constituents which give them a single melting point or (rarely) two. This is called the alloy's eutectic mixture.<br>  <br>  -Alloy steel is steel alloyed with other elements in amounts of between 1 and 50% by weight to improve its mechanical properties. Alloy steels are broken down into two groups: low alloy steels and high alloy steels. The differentiation between the two is somewhat arbitrary; Smith and Hashemi define the difference at 4%, while Degarmo, et. al., define it at 8%.[1][2] However, most commonly alloy steel refers to low alloy steel.<br>  <br>  These steels have greater strength, hardness, hot hardness, wear resistance, hardenability, or toughness compared to carbon steel. However, they may require heat treatment in order to achieve such properties. Common alloying elements are molybdenum, manganese, nickel, chromium, vanadium, silicon and boron.<br>  <br>  Go through the source links.|`|I5B7lQNvaa	alloy is better looking.it is less prone to corrosion.it has better strenght

Not included are non-animal organisms; plants, fungi and lots of mostly single-celled organisms and their fewer multi-celled relatives (eg. seaweed).|`|L6jfhxgvaa	to sum up, it's all living things that have a pair of lungs. that includes fish as gills are their lungs.|`|sDdgyyXbaa	All animals belong to a group depending on their characteristics. The groups are Mammals, amphibians, fish, reptiles, birds and insects. Within these groups there are sub groups. A mammal is an animal that suckles their young and gives birth to a live baby. Warm-blooded. (Humans, whales, dogs) An amphibian is a creature that breaths air, lives on land and in the water and has a breathable skin under water. Cold-blooded. (Frog, newt) A reptile has dry scaly skin and breaths air. Some like to hang out in the water as well as on land. They are cold-blooded animals. (Crocodile, komodo dragon, lizards, tortoise and turtles) Birds are self explanatory and warm-blooded. Fish live and breath under the water. Cold-blooded.  (A shark is a member of the fish family but a whale is not)  Insects again are self explanatory. The process of grouping these animals into categories  is called classification. The classification of animals gives you the animal kingdom.|`|NQK5K9Pbaa	Its all of the living things on earth.

hWyQUVdYaa	Patellar reflex is one example. When you hit the patellar tendon, the intrafusal muscle fibers stretch and sends signal via Ia afferent fibers to the spinal cord, which then stimulates the efferent alpha motor neurons to the quad muscle forcing them to contract. At the same time, Renshaw interneurons(they are inhibitory) inhibit the efferent alpha motor neuron to the hamstring muscles, causing them to relax. This prevents stretching of the muscle.

This is not necessarily the same as involving a lot of maths, though. This will depend on what kind of quantity surveying you do. Assessing the cost of a construction project does not require a lot of maths, but other forms of financial analysis does. See the AACE's "Required Skills and Knowledge of a Cost Engineer" and "National Competency Standards for Quantity Surveyors" for more information. <br>  <br>  Whether the maths is complex or not, depends upon your level of maths. You will need to know the mathematical tools for financial analysis - interest rates and tax calculations, and also probability and statistics. In most cases you can use tools and don't have to delve into the mathematical theory behind it.

First: You exist. <br>  If matter-energy can NOT be created, how did we all get here in the first place? But here we all are 'existing'. This implies the very hand of God leaving every atheist staring in the mirror asking themselves, "But how?" <br>   <br>  II. Second: ‘Big Bang’ and other cosmological evidence. <br>  If you truly understand quantum mechanics then you will know that the Big Bang theory requires a creator by fiat. Think of the universe in reverse until it's small enough to be completely described by quantum mechanics alone. In order for the universe to start unfolding into what we see now, our universe's specific wave function had to be brought into existence as a certain possibility out of an infinite number of other possible wave functions that had to collapse or at least decohere. At this fuzzy nanoscopic beginning, this required a 'Prime Observer' to enable this and set the expansion of the universe into motion and those initial conditions became the very facets of physical law. What we refer to as this finely tuned 'reality'. This need for an 'observer' comes from the basic quantum mechanical concept known as Shrodinger's Cat. Also, we must remember that the universe is being said to have come from nowhere which implies an act of 'creation'.<br>  This ever increasing expansion of our universe is alluded to 11 times in the Bible:<br>  Job 9:8 ; Psalm 104:2 ; Isaiah 40:22 ; Isaiah 42:5 ; Isaiah 44:24 ; Isaiah 45:12 ; Isaiah 48:13 ; Isaiah 51:13 ; Jeremiah 10:12 ; Jeremiah 51:15 ; Zechariah 12:1 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_bang</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodingers_cat" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schrodinger...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function_collapse" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_functi...</a><br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decoherence</a> <br>   <br>  The Bible also alludes to the ‘Big Rip’: <br>  Revelation 6:14 ; Isaiah 34:4 ; 2 Peter 3:10 <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_rip</a> <br>   <br>  III.

I wouldn't expect the beings to look just like us, though, but they would need to be able to walk upright, have hands and feet and be about our own size so as they are capable of handling the discoveries of technology. Our nearest star is 5 or 6 light years away and to send a message will take that long to get there. Then, assuming it does get received, they will have to decrypt it and if they send one back it will take another 5 to 6 years to get here. By that time we will have forgotten all about them. But, wouldn't it be fascinating?<br>  <br>  Just think. Earth has already sent its first interstellar mission which has now left the solar system.

E5HXTHszaa	Stem cells are cells that have yet to specialize in to particular cells like muscles, organ or brain tissues, given the right conditions and environment they can multiply into specific cells. The theory is that we can take these stem cells and grow them into whatever is missing from your body and transplant it or insert the cells directly and they will grow into the same kind of cell in its immediate environment. The controversy comes from where they are currently obtained from, the main source is from aborted fetus.

AA10880755	Verbatim quote from Wikipedia.  I think it is 100% clear:<br>  "... a black body is an object that absorbs all electromagnetic radiation that falls on it. No electromagnetic radiation passes through it and none is reflected. Because no light (visible electromagnetic radiation) is reflected or transmitted, the object appears black when it is cold.<br>  <br>  If the black body is hot, these properties make it an ideal source of thermal radiation. If a perfect black body at a certain temperature is surrounded by other objects in thermal equilibrium at the same temperature, it will on average emit exactly as much as it absorbs, at every wavelength. Since the absorption is easy to understand—every ray that hits the body is absorbed—the emission is just as easy to understand.<br>  <br>  A black body at temperature T emits exactly the same wavelengths and intensities which would be present in an environment at equilibrium at temperature T, and which would be absorbed by the body. Since the radiation in such an environment has a spectrum that depends only on temperature, the temperature of the object is directly related to the wavelengths of the light that it emits."|`|oAAhbfnvaa	black bodys emit the same temperature light as their temperature in kelvin. i.e. a black body at 373k will emit radiation (light) at a temperature (colour) of 373k.<br>  <br>  They do not exist and are merely theoretical.

7lpS0h7Paa	Dietary guidelines encourage a considerable increase in carbohydrate intake compared with the present situation in Western countries. Recent developments regarding nutritional effects of various digestible and undigestible carbohydrates call for more detailed recommendations. The "carbohydrates by difference" concept emerged 150 y ago because of the lack of specific analytical techniques and still prevails. The concept of available compared with unavailable carbohydrate was introduced in 1929 to obtain a better measure of glucogenic carbohydrates in diabetes. Dietary fiber was first defined as the "skeletal remnants of plant cell walls," but the definition was later expanded to include all polysaccharides and lignin that are not digested in the small intestine. The gravimetric method of the Association of Official Analytical Chemists for total dietary fiber is based on this undigestibility concept.

iTS8qJfoaa	Hi there<br>  <br>  I'm a mechanical engineer working in Australia.  Many overseas workers come on a 457 visa (employee sponsored) or a working holiday visa.  Most engineering companies are more than happy to sponsor 457 visas for engineers due to a shortage of personnel.<br>  <br>  The best way to find employment is to contact companies directly.  If you don't have any experience, most engineering contractors here hire graduates.  Most 2010 graduate positions will start to be advertised around about now, with applications closing between April and July.  Some companies will advertise later.  It is also a good idea to approach companies directly with a cover letter and your resume, explaining your situation, even if they don't have positions advertised.  Nearly all companies advertise their graduate vacancies on www.seek.com.au or www.mycareer.com.au.<br>  <br>  The major contractors that I know of in HVAC/Building Services in Perth (Western Australia) are GHD, SKM, Connel Wagner, Basset.  There are probably some other big players but I am not in that industry.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.. all the best.|`|pXra2klxaa	I am not a Mechanical Engineer but generally, when a fresh engineering graduate (without experience of course) starts to look for a job, he will apply to a company that best suited for his profession in order to learn and gain experience.<br>  <br>  One may either start as an apprentice or on the job training in order to learn and gain experience. He need not be so demanding for a higher salary because no company will ever give high salary to newly graduate guy.<br>  <br>  Your eagerness and enthusiasm to find job and gain experience will bring you to success later on. Only for now as an advise, just don't be afraid to apply for a job and have self confidence that you can handle any tasks that the company might give you. Usually, a company is testing and observing their newly hired employee if he is really knowledgeable and capable of handling tasks and even bigger tasks in the future. Along with a bigger task is bigger responsibility and higher salary. Just be patient. <br>  <br>  Also, don't be frustrated if some companies might reject your application due lack of experience. Those are just trials to you.

Besides, we're humans - we'll send probes because we are that curious.<br>  <br>  I think a timescale of 60,000 years is unrealistic - it would be virtually impossible to make something reliable enough to function that long.  We have to take a step beyond current velocity levels.<br>  <br>  More likely we will develop engines that impart a significant thrust over a long time, getting the probe up to a sizeable fraction of light speed over a period of years.  The first probes will just do a flyby at their terminal velocity, but later ones will slow down so as to be able to navigate round the target system.<br>  <br>  The mission time will still be many years, but it will be on the order of 50 or 100 for nearby stars - likely an achievable goal.  Such probes will need to have the ability for self repair, so AI-driven robots will be a necessity.  AI will have to be fairly sophisticated anyway for the probe to make good choices in exploring the system.

This 'Project Daedalus' addressed many of the issues of such a mission.|`|620RqMV3aa	Yes,there is a probe named pioneer 10 which was launched on  On March 2, 1972, engineers from NASA's Glenn Research Center launched Pioneer 10 from the Cape Kennedy, carrying Earth's first space probe to an outer planet. This launch was just one of the many historic missions started by Glenn's former launch vehicles team. Glenn successfully managed the launch of Pioneer 10: the first spacecraft to travel through the Asteroid belt, the first spacecraft to make direct observations and obtain close-up images of Jupiter, and the first man-made object to leave the solar system and travel on a flight path into interstellar space. Until February 1998, Pioneer 10 was the most remote object ever made by man. Traveling faster, Voyager 1 has since acheived a greater distance from the Sun.<br>  <br>  Pioneer 10's first challenge was to pass through what was initially feared to be an impenetrable asteroid belt. The mission to Jupiter and beyond, managed by the NASA's Ames Research Center, was very successful resulting in the return of scientific data and images. It became the first artifact to leave the solar system on June 13, 1983 when it passed beyond the farthest known planet. It continued to search for the heliopause for another 20 years, exploring the very edges of interstellar space as it drifted onward in mankind's first journey to the stars. Pioneer's last, very weak signal was received on January 23, 2003. It is believed that its power source had run too low to transmit a signal. At the time, Pioneer 10 was more than 7.6 billion miles away from Earth.<br>   But even now after 37 years pioneer 10 is the worlds first man made probe to travell far out in space to other stars and did flybys to our solar systems' planets and in now out of our solar system and also has a message in form of pictures if it will ever comes across an extraterrstrial! Their communication to earth is ceased but they (pioneer 10 and 11) will continue is journey forever... <br>   And Hubble Space Telescope is the most developed telescope in space and can take pictures of distand objects and you can call it a hyper telescope! (I hope i have answered your question).|`|MMUGLjsPaa	1) I think your last statement sums it up.  We'd build larger telescopes first.  <br>  2)  Currently we don't have anything that will last for 60000 years in space.  However, if we could solve the problem of distance then we would have to wait 60000 years for information.  We all know current propulsion technology is slow.  Currently, a plasma drive thruster is being developed that has the potential of knocking the trip to Mars down to 6 weeks. Moreover, harnessing the solar wind is another possibility.  However for deep space you need something faster.  Currently, nuclear detonation is our fastest (theorized) form of propulsion.  A detonation far out from the earth could accelerate a space craft close to the speed of light making the one way trip more plausible.  Of course you have to figure out how to slow down once you get there.<br>  3) If you could solve the problem of distance then you could use current thermonuclear powering technology to keep the probe operating (just as the Cassini probe is powered now).

faSUWKVtaa	As the above poster said, there's a lot of variation. But here's the general idea when it comes to most mushrooms that you see, like the ones in the grocery store.<br>  <br>  The life-cycle begins with a spore. This spore is "haploid;" it contains one copy of every chromosome. When conditions are right, it grows into a mesh of fungal 'roots', called a mycelium. These are not like plant roots, and can extend vast distances - one fungus in Washington covers two-and-a-half square miles with its mycelium, making it the largest known living organism!<br>  <br>  The mycelium is made of strands of cells called hyphae. Sexual reproduction begins when two sexually compatible hyphae meet. When that happens, they unite. Since each of the 'parent' hyphae had one set of chromosomes, and each cell in a parent strand had one nucleus, it follows that, where this merger has happened, the mycelium now has two nuclei per cell.<br>  <br>  This 'merged' mycelium makes the fruiting body, which is what we call a mushroom. Eventually, on the gills of this mushroom, "basidia," club-shaped cells, are formed. In the basidia, the nuclei fuse. Since each nucleus is from a haploid spore, and has one copy of the genome, the fused nucleus has two copies of the genome, one from each of the hyphal strands that merged. So it's "diploid."<br>  <br>  To make spores, first, the merged cell undergoes meiosis. This simply means that the two genome copies are separated apart again, but in a way that rearranges them. For example, if one parental strand of hyphae had some alleles we'll call ABCD, and the other had alleles abcd, meiosis could result in the sets of alleles ABcd and abCD. This happens all over the genome, and is the big benefit of sexual reproduction. New arrangements of genes are handy for staving off disease.<br>  <br>  Finally, the daughter cells of that meiosis undergo one last mitotic division, making four progeny cells. These are the four spores on the corners of the club-shaped basidium. And the cycle begins anew!<br>  <br>  (The rusts, which are also basidiomycetes, do things differently; I won't go into detail here.)<br>  <br>  Whew! I hope that's clear enough.|`|BBht4bGsaa	There are quite a lot of variations within basidiomycetes in their reproductive mechanisms.<br>  <br>  However, you should start by understanding "alternation of generations" ("sporic") life cycle.<br>  <br>  An important thing to understand is that unlike mammals, there are both multicellular diploid as well as haploid stages.<br>  <br>  Just keep track of whether each stage is haploid (n), diploid (2n), or dikaryotic (n + n).  Then note when plasmogamy (n) + (n) => (n + n); karyogamy (n + n) => (2n); and meiosis occur (2n) => (n).<br>  <br>  There's no particularly easy way to go about it.  Mushrooms have the simplest cycles, followed by smuts then rusts.

So there are not going to be any solutions, any values of y, where -4 x - 13 is negative. There's no point with x = 4 for instance, since -4*4 - 13 = -16 - 13 = -29.<br>  <br>  For values of x where -4 x - 13 > 0, you have two possible solutions for y, a positive one with -4 x - 13 = 13 y, and a negative one with -4 x - 13 = 13*(-y). Both of these have the same value of 13 |y|. So we know answer E is true.<br>  <br>  Is answer D true? Put in any value of y on the left hand side, for instance y = 1. How many solutions does <br>     13 = -4*x - 13 <br>  have? The answer is one. 13 |y| has only one possible value, and the linear equation -4*x - 13 = something has only one solution. So D is false.<br>  <br>  Now you can decide between A and B. If A is true, that's the same as saying for every value of y there's at most one value of x (i.e. D is false). Since D is true, A is true and B is false.<br>  <br>  To choose between C and F go through the same reasoning with whether statement E is true.

Lj91uwsZaa	most frogs lay eggs in the spring so you would have to keep the female in winter-like conditions for several months to induce egg-laying.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	I'm afraid Chaotic knows nothing about the breeding habits of Amphibians.<br>  All Amphibians have "external" fertilization, and the only way a female frog could be induced to lay eggs normally would be to have a male frog in amplexis with the female.  This is when he rides on her back and grasps her around the chest with a vise like grip, and will NOT let go until she has found a good place to lay her eggs.  When she does so, he releases clouds of sperm over the egg mass.<br>  Without a male, the only way you may be able to get the eggs is to squeeze them out of the female when she's full.  But, I'm not sure this will work without injuring her.  She is not like a fish and is rather sensitive and soft in body structure.|`|9977764272d89791dbe653655d661597aa	Oh, ok, I was about to say something about the recent question I saw about mating a Snake and an Elephant together *shiver*<br>  <br>  There probably is a way of artificially inseminating a female from with male frog sperm by injecting it to wherever the female frog needs the sperm at.<br>  Actually, I just looked it up, and it may be simpler than you think. HOWEVER you somehow need to get hold of male frog sperm.<br>  Since frog eggs are fertilized after they are laid, you can get male frog sperm, wait for the female frog to lay the eggs, then pour the male frog sperm over the eggs (supposing the frog sperm hasn't died by this time) and you probably have artificially fertilized the frog eggs!<br>  <br>  However, seeing as this is a science project, this seems highly unlikely. I suggest somehow finding fertilized eggs, or at least just find tadpoles to work with instead.

AA11614478	Advil PM contains ibuprofen and diphenhydramine. <br>  <br>  Ibuprofen (Motrin) is an anti-inflammatory medication and diphenhydramine (Benadryl) is an antihistamine, but it's also used to help people fall asleep. <br>  <br>  I honestly hate diphenhydramine. It doesn't help me sleep at all and gives me anixety. I work night shift and so it's hard for me to fall asleep sometimes.<br>  <br>  If you are looking for something over the counter to help you sleep you can use just diphenydramine alone or you can try doxylamine (which is a drug they put in Unisom and other "night time" medication). I use doxylamine by itself and it works great for me. Those are unfortunatly the only two over the counter medications to help people fall asleep (doxylamine and diphenhydramine). <br>  <br>  If you are still having a problem then you may need to get on a prescription medication like Ambien. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|QykYW3R7aa	Advil PM is simply regular Advil (ibuprofen) with Benadryl (diphenhydramine HCl) added to it.

6FmmttYcaa	obviously room2 will take more time for cooling. the answer  is simple..."the volume is more". dont go into the aspect of liquid theory.just tune into laws of heat transfer...u vl get to know more...|`|X9BAbTQbaa	It would certainly cost more to air condition the the 20ft room if you were to cool the area that average people don't use if you went down that path! There is another condition that you did not mention in your question that will give you the answer that you seek, that is if you used the air conditioner to heat the room! In this case the room will have to be heated from top to bottom for average people to gain any benefit from the exercise.|`|YHFybwuXaa	You have to cool ALL of the air on both rooms from the initial to the final temperature, so in terms of energy it will "cost" more to cool down Room 2. <br>  Otherwise, if you put a 6-feet-tall ceiling and cool just that volume, it will work as an heat sink and the heat from the top volume will transfer to the bottom and you'll have to cool it again.|`|BTuncwFuaa	So the thermostat is at a height of 6 feet. The airconditioning cools untill the set temp equals the temp at 6 feet. <br>  <br>  The temperature gradually increase towards the top of the room due to convection (ofcourse we consider a steady state situation). Also air mixing by movement is neglected.<br>  <br>  As the air + ceiling layer in the large room will have a lower conductive coefficient than the ceiling layer in the small room, the small room airco will loose more power in terms of conduction. Also the heat flux in the small room from the outside is higher, as there is a bigger difference in temperature along all the walls. <br>  <br>  However this is compensated by a smaller surface in the small room which looses heat. <br>  <br>  There is no clear answer. My guess is when you have a higher volume to surface ratio for both rooms the big room will be easier cooled and vice versa. <br>  <br>  I suggest a finite element simulation|`|qYEs97Vxaa	If you draw a control volume around the room you work out the total heat entering and leaving the room. The heat load will be the same unless the larger surface area of the taller room increases the heat transfer through the wall into the room. But this may not matter as it is in the upper part of the room. The temperature that air exists the room is also a factor. If by convection warmer air exists from the top of the room then less cooling is required.<br>  <br>  I don't think the answer is obvious, it depends on the assumptions you make about heat loads and convection. In my experience living in brick house with a high ceiling in a hot climate it always seems to be cool then other buildings.|`|AA10008098	Good question.  If you could restrain the cooling to only six feet it would cost the same to cool both rooms.  However, heat rises and would radiate to the individuals in the room from the ceilings.  Comfort may depend upon removing enough heat (and humidity) from both rooms and that would cost more for the taller room.  A lot might depend upon how the intake and discharge of the air conditioner are directed and air velocity because moving air entrains and mixes with stagnant air.  There is very little difference in air density (warm or cool) relative to air currents.  You might observe air currents by releasing (cigarette) smoke.
2lQ8DJAcaa	The word fossil comes from the Latin word fossilis, meaning “dug up.” Today, the word generally refers to any evidence of past life, from insects preserved in amber to<br>  imprints of a dinosaur’s foot. To hold a fossil is to hold millions of years of history in the palm of your hand. The<br>  ridges, bumps, and curves of a fossilized clam are the same ridges, bumps, and curves that existed as it filtered water from the sea long ago. Studying fossils provides clues about the Earth’s past, its climate, natural disasters, changing landforms, and changing oceans. Fossils<br>  tell about history and, like all good history, they help you to understand both the present and the future.|`|De4vgWXPaa	<<like do they contain evidence of how the earth began>><br>  <br>  No.  The oldest dino fossils are something like 230 million years old or so.  The Earth began 4.3 billion years earlier.<br>  <br>  <<what thland was like at that time>><br>  <br>  That's rather like asking what the land is presently like.  It varies.  One generalisation that could be made is that the climate was generally somewhat warmer and drier 230 million years ago.  Another is that there was more or less only the single megacontinent known as Pangea, and that meant terrestrial animals could spread around more easily than today.<br>  <br>  <<or useful medicine etc>><br>  <br>  Dino fossils are bits of stone.  The former organic material has been replaced.  They aren't medically useful unless you're prepared to accept cures based on ground up bits of stone.<br>  <br>  The main value is, in combination with other fossils, they provide information on how the world used to be, and happen to be damnably fascinating.  It's a bit like getting a glimpse at an alien planet which, nevertheless, happens to have been the Earth.  The subject is also thoroughly addictive should you happen to catch the infection.|`|jgyq3wtsaa	it helps us to know about that creature and the creature which came before them and how the earth is at that time ,everything which we are not able to see because we are not there at that time.
PnaeoH3eaa	When you do partial differentiation with respect to one variable, you treat the other one as a constant.<br>  <br>  10(1 - e^-0.4A) is all regarded as constant when differentiating with respect to T.<br>  Then the 1 - e^-T differentiates to (-e^-T)*(-1) = e^-T|`|5p2odET8aa	The ONLY function of T in the expression is e^-T.

zdsvsNkSaa	Unfortunately, the answer is no, barring some new developments.  Besides BECs being terribly difficult to work with, BECs and other slow light media change what is known as the group index (which describes how wave-packets and pulses travel through the material).  Without getting into details, telescopes and most imaging systems rely on the phase index.  These systems do not change the phase index considerably.|`|YHFybwuXaa	This is mostly my guesswork, I haven't actually looked through.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure a BEC lense telescope would be useful, because (as far as I know) typical BECs come from very cold matter (i.e. you have to extract heat from it) like liquid He4 (He3 nuclei are fermions). <br>  <br>  I'm not sure what would be the rate of radiative cooling in space, but outside the atmosphere a satellite can cook up on the sun-facing side and freeze down on the sun-hidden side, so this itself is a problem.

4YxuxEIOaa	Stem cells are cells found in most, if not all, multi-cellular organisms. They are characterized by the ability to renew themselves through mitotic cell division and differentiating into a diverse range of specialized cell types. Research in the stem cell field grew out of findings by Canadian scientists Ernest A. McCulloch and James E. Till in the 1960s. The two broad types of mammalian stem cells are: embryonic stem cells that are isolated from the inner cell mass of blastocysts, and adult stem cells that are found in adult tissues. In a developing embryo, stem cells can differentiate into all of the specialized embryonic tissues. In adult organisms, stem cells and progenitor cells act as a repair system for the body, replenishing specialized cells, but also maintain the normal turnover of regenerative organs, such as blood, skin or intestinal tissues.<br>  <br>  Stem cells can now be grown and transformed into specialized cells with characteristics consistent with cells of various tissues such as muscles or nerves through cell culture. Highly plastic adult stem cells from a variety of sources, including umbilical cord blood and bone marrow, are routinely used in medical therapies. Embryonic cell lines and autologous embryonic stem cells generated through therapeutic cloning have also been proposed as promising candidates for future therapies.|`|PYK3FzbHaa	stem cells are just normal cells before they have developed into anything els.<br>  they can get them out and elternate them to become any cells that are needed.<br>  bone marrow, etc!<br>  they are clever things and save many lives due to their amazing way of  reating new cells - whatever is needed.<br>  i reckon that answers your question bang on!!!!!! x|`|gkxUYCq6aa	Stem cells are a blank cell that can become any other cell... <br>  check here for more info|`|jd14u32qaa	Before you're born, the cells in your body that will eventually become brain, liver, skin, etc. start out as generic 'stem cells'.

ZTVmUb4Laa	It's been a while since I've seen an episode, but I'll try...<br>  <br>  1. It is true that data is a machine and therefore capable of "reading" very quickly, but this doesn't mean he is capable of immediately understanding what he reads, particularly with regard to fiction that has been written by humans. One  reason why fiction is interesting is because it tends to elicit emotion from the reader... something data is incapable of understanding on his own. So Data can process most kinds of information at a faster rate than humans, but he cannot understand this information (something he very much wants to do as a sentient lifeform) unless he interacts with humans. A good example of this would be the Sherlock Holmes episodes. Data memorizes all of the Holmes' mysteries, but he doesn't really understand them until he recreates  one on the holodeck with human beings. Even then it's not really clear whether he does or doesn't...<br>  <br>  2. I'm sure he does think more quickly than humans. As for moving quickly... well, he does when he thinks it's necessary and/or  when serves a purpose. Else, he doesn't. He his a machine after all...  I would think that, like any machine, his life span can be shorted by improper usage. <br>  <br>  3. It's Star Trek... they travel multiple times faster than light and and convert energy into matter. If you accept that then this should be a piece of cake. <br>  <br>  4. See first answer. <br>  <br>  5. There is no reason why he would have to  excrete ingested matter. We know that is used at least some of it to "lubricate his biofunctions," which suggests that it would not be removed. If there's any left over I guess he would just have to convert it into energy...<br>  <br>  6. I've often wondered this myself. I don't think anyone really knows what his power source was. <br>  <br>  7. Several people (including data himself) tried to duplicate him, but never successfully. This was a topic in several different shows. One guy wanted to force Data to resign from Starfleet so that he could experiment on him... basically speed up the process of creating more Datas. Then Picard showed that Data is sentient and he was subsequently unable to do so...<br>  <br>  <br>  8. I don't think anyone ever said he remained "cutting edge." A '69 Camaro isn't exactly cutting edge, but it's still an incredible piece of engineering. <br>  <br>  9. 100,000 terebytes = 100,000,000,000,000,000 bytes  <br>  <br>  =100,000,000 Gigabytes<br>  <br>  A *hundred million* giga bytes is still pretty huge... but your right that it would have sounded even bigger in 1987. <br>  <br>  <br>  Sorry if I got a little touchy in some of my responses...

That is mostly for the benefit of the weather service, so they don't have 100 people calling in a tornado report just because they see a funnel shaped cloud.  <br>  <br>  From my experience as a storm chaser, if you're "too close" to a tornado, the cops typically don't want to be anywhere near you.

To function properly, the body requires between one and seven liters of water per day to avoid dehydration<br>  Future Provision of water is also depend on the safety of our water resources. Which are in danger due to pollution caused by industries and other sources? It produces pollutants that are extremely harmful to people and the environment.<br>  Many industrial facilities use freshwater to carry away waste from the plant and into rivers, lakes and oceans.<br>  Water pollution is any chemical, physical or biological change in the quality of water that has a harmful effect on any living thing that drinks or uses or lives (in) it. When humans drink polluted water it often has serious effects on their health. Water pollution can also make water unsuited for the desired use.<br>  There are several classes of water pollutants. Water pollution is usually caused by human activities. Different human sources add to the pollution of water. There are two sorts of sources, point and nonpoint sources. Point sources discharge pollutants at specific locations through pipelines or sewers into the surface water. Nonpoint sources are sources that cannot be traced to a single site of discharge.<br>  <br>  for other information check my source site|`|mUfStFbxaa	your state DNR

524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	1) Movement of stars predict the future:  He already knew that to be false.<br>  <br>  2) the 2012 predictions had not yet been invented in his days.  However, he would have easily seen that they were created out of thin air by people who are trying to make themselves sound important.  In his days, there were people trying to sell gas masks because Earth was going to cross the tail of the comet.<br>  If you don't buy my mask, you will die!!!<br>  <br>  But the stuff associated with the Big 2012 Hoax came after Einstein's death.  Even the "ancient predictions".<br>  <br>  The "end of the Mayan calendar" was invented in the 1980s by José A. who was selling books where he pretends to understand Meso-American calendars.  The Mayan calendar does not end; it merely reaches a round figure (same as when our calendar "ended" at the end of 1999, because the number 2000 had not been invented yet).<br>  <br>  Planet X was invented by charlatans to explain their prediction of the end-of-the-world for... 2003.  They had a book for sale on how to survive the passage of Planet X.  After 2003, they revised the book, used José's date and added features from Nibiru (invented in the 1960s by Zecharia S. and not due to return before 2085) and Nemesis (from a theory that was dropped in the 1990s -- due to return in 17 to 20 million years).<br>  <br>  The charlatans are the ones who prepared the fake documentaries for television and YouTube.  They also invented most of the "ancient predictions" (Nostradamus, Bible, Egyptians...) after 2003 -- otherwise they would have clashed with their 2003 predictions.<br>  <br>  They also invented many of the other doom-and-gloom scenarios (flipping of poles, for example), but some independent hoaxers also pitched in.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  The Mayans had a very advanced civilization.  They had a relatively good day-count calendar used for astronomy (that is the one that reaches the round figure on the date we call 2012.12.21).  It is quite an insult to their intelligence to claim that they are involved in this "prediction".<br>  <br>  In fact, the Mayans left writings describing events that they thought would happen in the future (and involve humans), well after the year we call 4000.  They use their calendar to date these events.  Obviously, they expected neither the world nor their calendar to end.<br>  <br>  The idea that the "round figure" marks a New Age was concocted by our astrologers (not astronomers) based on the Popol Vuh -- it is presented as a sacred book of the Mayans, but it was actually written by a Spanish priest during th 16th century.  It contains a mix of Mayan beliefs that had survived 5 centuries of oral recounting, and of European Christian biblical stories.  <br>  <br>  Conveniently enough, the original (known to have been written in Latin alphabet -- our alphabet, not the Mayans) was lost.

TnPiiwoAaa	The voltage varies depending on the legnth of the bolt of lightning (can be up to a gigavolt, or 1 billion volts in positive lightning which is up to 10 times more powerful than the more common negative lightning), but voltage isn't necessarily what kills you, it's ampage.

It relaxes most people (although it sends me into a panic attack which is why I will never use it again).  It alters thought patterns which can provide a creative spark and contribute to self-actualization.  Although to what extent is completely in the mind of the user.  It may feel like you are a genius and discovering/understanding all of these brilliant concepts, but to an onlooker you may appear "not too brilliant."<br>  <br>  Other cons: it's illegal so getting caught with it can land you in jail and ruin your future/reputation (which is unfortunate, considering it shouldn't really be illegal, IMO).<br>  It definitely decreases motivation in many people.  Statistically, it can serve as a "gateway drug" to harder drugs.<br>  <br>  In my opinion (even though I don't personally use it), it is no worse than alcohol and should be legally treated the same way, but the powers that be have no way to regulate it, hence why people are put in jail every day for doing nothing worse than having a beer.

86Ha3RlTaa	They may be small, but have a high surface area for their size. This is to aid oxygen exchange within the capillaries. <br>  <br>  The capillaries are very small and narrow blood vessels, slowing the red blood cells down, again to maximise gaseous exchange.<br>  <br>  We need them so small i suppose, to carry oxygen around the body efficently.|`|5dxjJppsaa	Red blood cells with their normal average size of 6-8 um are essentially small because of their prime importance in the transport of oxygen all over the human body. They are transported with oxygen bound to their hemoglobin pigments passing through very small capillaries. In order to reach these parts, the RBCs should be small enough. Aside from the very small size, RBCs have added characteristic of being flexible brought by the absence of nucleus and the presence of a flexible membrane itself.|`|AA10008098	Red blood cells are flexible.  In fact they must bend to get through tiny capillaries in order to exchange gases (carbon dioxide and oxygen) going from more concentrated to less concentrated within tissue and within the lungs.  Blood cells in the middle of a larger vessel are not in intimate contact with the gases.  A red blood cell lives only about 120 days and is removed from circulation when it is no longer flexible enough.  Donating a pint of blood reduces the average age of the remaining blood (probably a good thing for carrying extra oxygen).  Each fresh red blood cell is packed full of hemoglobin.

gCn6bXAFaa	Mushrooms evolved to fruit during/after rainstorms, they need the extra moisture to "inflate" the fruit like a balloon, raise it up high and get the spores drifting.  The wind may also help blow the spores around.  Anyway conditions reqd to grow mushrooms in a lab reflects this.<br>  <br>  Cubensis performs best at 90%humidity and 84-86 degF for the veg cycle.  This is where the mycelium colonizes the substrate.  In natures this usually happens underground or inside a big pile or rotting stuff so the Co2 can become quite concentrated in this stage.   <br>  <br>  Than the rain shower comes.  This is what initiates pinhead formation.   Humidity is raised to 95-100%, temperature is reduced to 74-78 degF.  Diffuse light is also required because mushrooms will only form where the mycelium intersects with the surface, rare in nature.  The substrate will now require fresh air (1-3 air exchanges per hour) for the same reason.<br>  <br>  Now the rain has moved through, the humidity has dropped to 85-90% but the temperature stays at about 74-78 these are cropping conditions and can be sustained for several weeks.

There is no way to speed up the excretion process.|`|1j60dOgOaa	I've had 22 jobs, from Google to Burger King to USPS, I've drug tested on majority of them. All the rumors about it taking 1 month to leave your system are false. The amount of misinformation on here is unbelievable. I would like these people to explain how I've passed tests 1 WEEK after smoking, MANY TIMES. THC stays in your fat cells, urine tests look for the metabolites which the THC produces, not the actual THC. So you need to get it out of not only your fat cells, but your urinary tract. Cranberry juice for urinary tract, exercise and low fat foods for your fat cells. Don't exercise the day of the test or the day before. It can stay in your system UP to 1 month, meaning 1 month MAXIMUM. This is where alot of non-smokers get confused and think it means 1 month minimum. You can easily find plenty of people on the internet who have smoked and passed in much less than a month, so I don't know how they explain all those people. Just look at the comments under this youtube video, all the people that took the advice and passed in much less than a month. I dont know how they explain all those comments, those people must not be real huh.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoD_YSR46I&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yZoD_YSR4...</a><br>  But if you are overweight it takes longer to leave your system. I'm 6"3 and only 150 lbs, so I'm very skinny and it leaves my system naturally very quickly. The only sure way to pass a test is synthetic urine. Those detox drinks are scams. All they are is creatine mixed with water and coloring. Look at the ingredients, theres no magic formula there. Its all about diluting and not all labs pass for dilution any more. In fact, most do not. So the people you hear passing tests with detox drinks were lucky enough to go to to a lab that still passes dilution. Ive been to many which did not, and I failed once because of dilution and had to sit there and drink water and retake it 20 minutes later. So diluting your body with lots of water, or detox drinks (the same thing as drinking lots of water) is not a good idea. Synthetic urine does work. Its basically urine in a bottle which is lab made. If you dont trust it, then just have a friend urinate in a bottle and buy a hand warmer to keep it at body temperature, its the same thing as synthetic urine really.<br>  <br>  I have a prescription and have had many jobs, employers don't honor prescriptions in California so you can imagine how many drug tests I've had to pass in my life as long as I've had a prescription. <br>  <a href="http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w106/JordanPar23/100_0274.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w106/...</a><br>  <a href="http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w106/JordanPar23/100_0263.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i174.photobucket.com/albums/w106/...</a>|`|hzoUwZGiaa	There is NO way to get it THC out of your system fast.

pep1yy4eaa	Organic means the compound consists of carbon, hydrogen, AND an oxygen molecules.<br>  <br>  C6H12O6 is thus organic, while others are missing the carbon and hydrogen.|`|797Bf914aa	To a chemist, "organic" means carbon-containing.|`|EJSdI25Naa	Organic chemistry involves the chemistry of life and is based on the element carbon, expressed in chemistry as C. The simplest carbon based molecule is methane, CH4. The two elements lend electrons to each other to build up their alternate rings. The electrons, travelling at the speed of light, can never be determined to be on one element or the other, but they do their job.<br>  <br>  In your list of three formulae, only one contains C so your question is very easy to answer. But write it out correctly:  C6H12O6.  It looks as if you are representing sugar. Is that right? Check it out.<br>  <br>  What happens when you put sugar in a saucepan and put it over the heat and left unattended? It burns. The heat will make the oxygens and hydrogens unite to form water  (6H20). These leave carbons swimming around, which will unite into carbon molecules (C2). What colour is carbon? Pure diamonds are pure crystallised carbon and are transparent and colourless. But the carbon you have in your saucepan is not diamond. If your burn a lump of wood, what colour will it go? Black. Charcoal. So the burnt sugar in your saucepan will also be black. (And hard to scrub off, too.) What is that black stuff?<br>  <br>  Organic chemistry is fascinating and so very logical once you  understand how everything all gets linked together. It is worth every effort you put into understanding  it. I hope you come to enjoy it and really excell.<br>  <br>  Best wishes from Barrie O.
eCjx7kLAaa	Typically, they start building upwards, and increase their imports.  Look at Monaco or Singapore for example.  Hong Kong, though not a country, provides a similar example.  These places all pack huge populations into relatively tiny chunks of land, and have had to find ways to deal with it without expanding their borders.<br>  <br>  Which actually brings another note, sometimes they simply attack their neighbors and take over their land.<br>  <br>  However, countries don't really have hard limits on population capacity.  They may have a rough limit on how much then can support without any imports, as a self-sustaining country, but that varies widely for each country.  Places like US and China have enormous capacity because they have tons of land and tons of resources within their borders.  Opposite goes for small or low-resource countries.|`|YOqbGO2Maa	Nothing special happens at that exact point. One person more or less hardly matters.

More people per square mile, means less living space, privacy, I am sure stress=violence will rise as mentioned before.

Interesting.<br>  <br>  By using the word hypothesis you are being asked to imagine a state where you don't have all the answers yet. This is a perfectly normal way of doing science.<br>  <br>  For example, one hypothesis about the Solar System's composition might be;<br>  <br>  "The Solar System is mostly made of rock"<br>  <br>  Well, every hypothesis has to be tested. So, to test this hypothesis you would simply study the make-up of each body. Is it rock? Or is it not?<br>  <br>  You'd kick the ground outside (yep, rocks), dig a hole (still rocks), look at the Moon (ditto), but then you'd ask what the Sun is made of.<br>  <br>  And you'd work out that the Sun is big and far away, and the only reasonable way to work out its nature is by spectroscopy - and it would turn out to be mostly hydrogen (at least, the surface you can see).<br>  <br>  You'd do the same to the gas giants, maybe using Cassini and Galileo data, and in that way you would refute the hypothesis that the Solar System is mostly made of rock.<br>  <br>  So, that's not a great hypothesis, but it's not a bad one, simply because it *is* testable.<br>  <br>  A hypothesis that cannot be tested is not worth investigating.<br>  <br>  Good luck!

zFsTSrOcaa	Since there was no major storm in Galveston in 1990, you must be referring to the hurricane in 1900.  Its overall path (but not its exact landfall) was predicted, but by Cuban meteorologists.  The US forecasters thought it would end up off the Atlantic coast.  It wasn't until the wind and surf were already rising that Galveston knew about the hurricane.<br>  <br>  No specific laws resulted, but much of the city of Galveston was raised by up to 17 feet, and a 17-foot seawall was installed around part of Galveston Island for additional protection.

PAlP6j7faa	I will try and answer this as easily as I can, but first you must be familiar with diffusion, osmosis, and osmoregulation.<br>  Okay take a deep breath:<br>  <br>  First: Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a selectively permiable membrane in response to a concentration gradient. A concentration gradient is the situation in which different areas have different levels of concentration. Osmosis is a special case of diffusion. It occurs whenever water molecules diffuse from a region of higher concentration to a region of lower concentration across a selectively permeable membrane. <br>  <br>  Second: Cell membranes are usually permeable to water. Water is equilibriated by osmosis throughout the body. This makes the concentration of water and solutes in intracellular (in the cell) and extracellular (around the cell) essentially the same. This creates a situation where the osmotic pressure in the intracellular and extracellular fluid is the same. This means it is an isotonic solution. <br>  <br>  Now we can start to understand why we can't drink salt water. Drinking water normally quenches your thirst. But when you drink salt water it seems to make you more thirsty. The water in your mouth creates a situation in which the cells in your mouth are in a hypertonic solution. Hypertonic is a condition in which a solution contains a lesser concentration of dissolved particles than the solution to which it is compared. Cells with this condition tend to gain water by osmosis and swell. Even though cell membranes are somewhat elastic, the cells may swell so much that they burst. Salt water not only dries out your mouth but the cells in your body too!! As it enters your body, the cells near it release water to reach equilibrium with the surrounding fluid. The cells shrink and may become damaged. This is a condition called dehydration, or excessive water loss.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!!|`|Sx8flPSAaa	salt water makes you dehydrate at a dangerous pace and eventually your body will shut down..|`|l5s7x31Laa	water and ions always try to reach equilibrium. meaning the ions will be evenly distributed in the water. When you drink sea water, the concentration of salt in the sea water is greater than that in the human intestines. So, the water in your intestines will move down its concentration gradient to reach equilibrium. This means you are losing water and will dehydrate. Without water in your system, cells shrivel and die.

NbdTgyLPaa	I think the most basic part of the guitar, at least when it comes to making sound, is the strings.  These vibrate at certain frequencies - which is what makes the basic sound.  But exactly how the string makes a certain note depends on the string itself, the effective length of the string (like when a finger is pressed on the string along the neck, making the part that can vibrate into a shorter string), etc.  The air cavity in the guitar also makes a difference on the exact sound that is made.  I found a couple of websites for you that go into more detail.  I'd say the first one talks more about the physics of the sound in the guitar while the second seems more about how guitars work in general.

YQZmc1ISaa	since when was NaCl an acid??? It's a salt consisting of Na+ and Cl- ions which are free to move in soltion so it conducts. HCl dissociates in water to give a solution containing H+ and Cl- ions. H+ ions conduct better than metal ions as they don't actually need to move through the solution from one 'side' to the other. It's a sort of chain reaction with H+ joining to a water molecule on one 'side' of trhe container leading to an H+ leaving another water molecule on the other 'side'. Hard to explain without a diagram so it's probably enough to say that the small size and high mobility of H+ ions make them better conductors than larger ions|`|bQ36mdBdaa	It could be related to the fact NaCl is not an acid, but a salt.|`|Ke094db6aa	HCl is a strong acid - that means that it will dissociate completely in solution, so that only ions are left.  Others are weaker, and will not dissociate -completely- into ions, and it's the ions that conduct the electricity.<br>  <br>  In higher concentrations, solubility is also an issue.  HCl is completely soluble in all concentrations, while NaCl will stop dissolving after a certain point.<br>  <br>  Strong acids and bases are good electrolytes (conductors of electricity while in solution) because they will turn completely into ions in water.  Weak acids and bases will still have some of the molecular form left, so even though they still conduct, it's just not as well.<br>  <br>  Ionic salts, such as NaCl, are actually very good electrolytes.  It's a small difference, really.<br>  <br>  (And just because something isn't a proton donor doesn't make it have a pH of less than 7.  I have no idea whether or not NaCl(aq) has a low pH, but Bronsted-Lowry acids aren't the only ones).

They can show incredible bonds with each other and with humans, but even these bonds can be forgotten in the blink of an eye in many instances.  Go to Sea World and you will find that the dolphins are not all that friendly.  I went there last year and at Dolphin Cove, where you can feed the dolphins, I asked a trainer if guests were ever accidentally bitten by the dolphins.  Her answer was, "Yes, all the time, and not always by accident."<br>  <br>  I worked at a zoo with a gentlemen who worked at Sea World San Diego.  He trained raptors and otters while he was there, and also had a short stint as a dolphin trainer.  He said he absolutely hated working with them and would never do it again.  He said they were like 5-year-old children, spoiled rotten and would throw fits if they didn't get their way.<br>  <br>  Incidents with captive dolphins are not all that rare, and they normally stem from normal pod behaviors that cannot be properly dealt with in a captive environment where there are small groups of dolphins.  They are very aggressive toward each other in their normal day-to-day lives, it's part of how they communicate (if you notice, dolphins are covered with scars and marks from other dolphins' teeth).  When they are "picked on" by other dolphins, their natural response is to take it out on other dolphins.  When they are in captivity and are being picked on by everyone, but there are not other "lesser" dolphins around, they only thing they can do is take it out on people.  This behavior has also been attributed to sexual frustration, because they really have no opportunity to pick their mates and breed like they would in the wild, breeding is very controlled in captivity.<br>  <br>  Dolphins of course don't always seem so bad, they have been credited with saving human lives.  But as with all animals, they are wild, they have wild instincts and behaviors, and they can go from playful to aggressive in an instant.|`|eiim3tJuaa	no<br>  <a href="http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/series/hunter-hunted/2606/Overview#tab-Videos/02394_00" rel="nofollow">http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/se...</a><br>  Hunter and Hunted: Dolphins Attack<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2006/06/12/susan_sarndon_recalls_dolphin_attack" rel="nofollow">http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/marine_mammals_news/sea_world_attack_reaffirms_whale_of_a_truth_captive_orcas_can_be_dangerous.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.hsus.org/marine_mammals/marin...</a><br>  By the same logic, people often think they can safely interact with dolphins at so-called swim-with-the-dolphin  programs.

YXVA3MpZaa	Water changes its density in respect to its temperature, but not on a linear scale, and not even continuously in one direction. a block of common ice will sometimes float in a tub of water because solid water can be less dense than liquid water at some temperatures. This is an extremely important property of water. At room temperature, liquid water becomes denser with lowering temperature, just like other substances. But at 4 °C (3.98 to be precise), just above freezing, water reaches its maximum density, and as water cools further toward its freezing point, the liquid water, under standard conditions, expands to become less dense. The physical reason for this is related to the crystal structure of ordinary ice, known as hexagonal ice Ih.<br>  <br>  hope this helped..<br>  good luck

That is, that they stimulate  synthesis of muscles. They have secondary effects. That is why they are forbidden for athletes. They can be dangerous for all people. Some steroids are prescribed by Drs.

fBgpqq2Eaa	Let L = length of fenced area and W = width of fenced area.<br>  <br>  The total amount of fence needed is L + 3W = 330 (solving this for L, we have L = 330 - 3W)<br>  <br>  The area is A = LW = (330 - 3W)W = -3W^2 + 330W<br>  <br>  We need to maximize area.  Since this is a quadratic (parabola), we can just use the formula for a vertex of a parabola.<br>  <br>  The vertex of a parabola occurs at W = -b/(2a) = -330/(2(-3)) = -330/-6 = 55<br>  <br>  Therefore, the width of the fence will be 55 (you will need three 55-foot sections) and the length will be 165 (you will need only 1 165-foot section).<br>  <br>  The maximum area is 55(165) = 9,075 square feet.

p0SOWgb5aa	I'm afraid if you're aiming to work with marine mammals you generally have an either or choice: either you accept that you are going to get paid rubbish but are happy nevertheless because you are doing what you love or you don't work with marine mammals.<br>  The only possible exception I could see is something like a Zoo vet. Vets generally get paid quite well and aquariums and rehabilitation centres are obviously in need of vets.<br>  <br>  A lot of people want to work with whales and dolphins but hardly anyone seems to realise that it's a very difficult field to get into, generally you don't go to college for 4 years and then get to work with dolphins, it can take years and years to even have a chance at being accepted for a marine mammal job. Of course you can luck out and get into faster but generally that is not the case.<br>  <br>  So what jobs are there working with marine mammals?<br>  Let's start with the one I would personally favour, working with marine mammals in the wild. There are several jobs that could involve doing that:<br>  research, rehabilitation, zoo vet or eco-tourism (ie. whale watching) but either way college would probably be on the list (not too sure about eco-tourism).<br>  <br>  1.1 RESEARCH<br>  If you want to go into research, you have a lot of education in front of you so, great if you have a lot of As to get you there.<br>  While you can get a job at a BSc. level, this is usually not the case if you are aiming to work with marine mammals as these jobs are very few and far between and highly competed for but a BSc. in a biology related subject is a good place to start anyhow. Subjects that I would recommend are :zoology, marine biology, biology, animal behaviour, animal science. One thing you need to be aware of if you choose marine biology however, it is not going to be about marine mammals. While marine mammals is what draws many people to this field, it is only a tiny portion of the big picture and you will spend most of your undergraduate time dealing with animals or algae significantly smaller than that.<br>  If you can, try and do an internship for credit for a semester or so, some universities will let you do that and it may give you the chance to work with marine mammals. I know Eckerd College work closely together with a dolphin research program and College of the Atlantic do a lot on fin whales themselves, so that sort of universities are probably quite recommendable for enabling you to get practical experience.Mote Marine Lab in Florida also offer great college internships, some of them with marine mammals (dolphins and manatees):<br>  <a href="http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendocs&id=283" rel="nofollow">http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendoc...</a><br>  If you want to work specifically in marine mammal research, you should then try to go for a related Masters, there are a few universities out there that offer Marine Mammal Science as an MSc. though, again, not many and they are usually difficult to get in, St. Andrews in the UK is renowned for it's program:<br>  <a href="http://bio.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx?psr=16" rel="nofollow">http://bio.st-andrews.ac.uk/pageset.aspx...</a><br>  Alternatively, look for a subject like Animal Behaviour and research the lecture staff of different universities to see what their research interests are, a lot of people will be reluctant to allow a marine mammal project as they are notoriously difficult and unreliable to do so it helps if you have a supervisor that is interested in what you are doing.<br>  Even with an MSc. though, your dream job is not guaranteed, it will most likely not be the first job you get after uni as experience in the field is highly valued and you may need to do some jobs you do not enjoy as much before even being considered. Some people do get lucky and as unjust as it sounds, knowing people pays off which makes internships and the like even more important, if you impress people there, they will be more likely to give you a good reference, or if they are actually hiring, they often prefer people they know, solely because they know how efficiently you work-or not.<br>  A lot of people working with Marine Mammals will go on to do a Phd. but it is not necessarily a prerequisite and you do not need to do it straight away, an MSc. however will probably help you and also usually ensures slightly higher entry level pay.<br>  A BSc. takes 4 years in the US (3 in Europe), an MSc. 2-3 (1 in Europe) and a Phd. varies, maybe around 3-4 years, shorter or longer also possible.<br>  <br>  1.2 REHAB<br>  If you want to go into rehab, you should probably go through Vet school, which I don't know much about and so won't pretend I do know about, lol. You may not need to go all the way, if you are a vet tech with relevant experience, you may be quite welcome in one of the rehab centres. There are quite a lot in the US and if you want to get into that, I highly recommend trying to intern or volunteer with one or more to gain some experience.<br>  I know in the UK there is also an MSc. course called Wild Animal Health, which I presume will qualify you for working in one of these centres as well:<br>  <a href="http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Education/Postgraduate/MScWildAnimalHealth/Index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Education/Postgradu...</a><br>  <br>  1.3 ECO-TOURISM<br>  I wouldn't be sure how to go about this one exactly but it's probably one of the ones that has the most varied routes into it I can imagine as you may not need a formal education in biology as long as your knowledge of the animals you are taking tourists to see is sound.<br>  There are some courses in eco-tourism as well though ( I know because I was half thinking of applying to one) but those are usually at MSc. level, it might be something you would consider if you are not too into science.<br>  <br>  1.4 Zoo vet<br>  I don't know that much about this one either but I expect it includes standard vet school. I think in the US that entails 4 years of college, and then another 4 years in veterinary school and then passing a veterinary medical board examination before you qualify. There are also requirements for you to take state board examinations if you are planning to practice in another state aside from the one you took your board examination in.See:<br>  <a href="http://careerplanning.about.com/od/occupations/p/veterinarian.htm" rel="nofollow">http://careerplanning.about.com/od/occup...</a><br>  You will probably need to undergo more specialised training, I know a university in London offers a specific course for exotic animals:<br>  <a href="http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Postgraduate/Masters/MScWildAnimalHealth/Index.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.rvc.ac.uk/Postgraduate/Master...</a><br>  <br>  2. CAPTIVITY<br>  With captive animals, I guess you do have numerous ways to approach it as well, though again, most people seem to think of one of them in specific when they talk about 'working with dolphins'. First of all, we have rehab/vet care again, to some extent there is research and there is what most people think about; training.<br>  Approach for vet care and research would pretty much be the same as described above I would imagine so I won't go over that again. So straight to it:<br>  <br>  2.1 TRAINING<br>  First off, let's clear up a misconception here, you do not need a degree to become a trainer, certainly not in marine biology. Training is not about science, it is about manipulation, you do not need a scientific background for that because it has nothing to do with science.<br>  SeaWorld and co do say they like their trainers to have a BSc. degree but fact is, most of them don't, at least not in anything related. They also prefer psychology over marine biology or zoology. You certainly will not need to take your education further than a BSc., what they value is experience and showmanship, so so you should be looking at doing a lot of volunteering, at zoos, aquariums, pet shops, stables, natural history museums....anything that is vaguely related, no experience is bad experience.<br>  There is one college in the US that offers exotic animal training, that is moorpark:<br>  <a href="http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_students/teaching_zoo/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.moorparkcollege.edu/current_s...</a><br>  A place that offers training experience relatively frequently is Miami Seaquarium, however the conditions there are more appalling than in most other aquariums holding cetaceans, so I’ would recommend you keep away from that, don't come anywhere near it with a ten metre pole, avoid it like the pest and don't ever set foot into it but that is obviously up to you, other places will probably value it as training experience:<br>  <a href="http://www.miamiseaquarium.com/visitor_info/jobs.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.miamiseaquarium.com/visitor_i...</a><br>  However can I just say I cannot stress enough what a disgrace that place is....<br>  I personally would recommend having a look to see if Epcot still offer internships with their dolphins, while I am generally not a friend of cetacean captivity, at least the exhibit is a higher standard than most facilities and the dolphins and trainers actually actively participate in research rather than shows:<br>  <a href="http://mentor.lscf.ucsb.edu/pipermail/biology-u-l/2000-August/000222.html" rel="nofollow">http://mentor.lscf.ucsb.edu/pipermail/bi...</a><br>  Something else I would recommend would be an Animal Care Internship somewhere like Mote:<br>  <a href="http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendocs&ref=College%20Internship%3A%20Opportunities&category=Education#hospital" rel="nofollow">http://www.mote.org/index.php?src=gendoc...</a><br>  As an Animal Care Intern you work with both rehab animals (they recently had a pygmy sperm whale) and their two resident dolphins (unreleasable rescues) Harley and Moonshine. While Mote does not do shows as they generally present their animals as close to natural as possible, they do do some training, mainly husbandry procedures as presenting parts of the body for inspection etc.<br>  They also have a highschool internship which is however run by the Sarasota Dolphin Research Program, not the hospital, during which students observe Harley and Moonshine and produce activity budgets and then go out in the wild to compare this to the behaviour of wild dolphins.<br>  As far as I know you need to be scuba certified as well, so you should probably get into contact with your local PADI or NAUI instructor<br>  <br>  Obviously check out the SW career site:<br>  <a href="http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/training/animal-training-careers.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info...</a>|`|h4wNRqf9aa	commercial whaling...<br>  <br>  <br>  helping animals rarely pays well...<br>  hurting them is a multi-billion dollar industry..

YYLybWHSaa	All algae use chlorophyll A but they vary their accessory pigments. <br>  <br>  Red algae use chlorophyll A and chlorophyll C plus beta-carotene and a number of unique xanthophylls. Phycoerythrin is responsible for the color of most red algae and is an accessory pigment. It passes the energy it collects to chlorophyll A.<br>  <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rhodophyta.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/protista/rh...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/Phycoerythrin" rel="nofollow">http://www.absoluteastronomy.com/topics/...</a><br>  <br>  The major accessory class of photosynthetic pigments are the carotenoids. They collect light in the red to yellow wavelengths chlorophyll a can’t. Then the carotenoids transfer the energy to chlorophyll a, making the carotenoids the second class of photosynthetic pigments or accessory pigments. They also absorb excess light energy and dissipate it in order to avoid damage in what is termed the Xanthophyll Cycle so their other job is protection. <br>  <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gloss3/pigments.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/glossary/gl...</a><br>  <br>  Brown or golden phaeophyta use chlorophyll a & c plus fucoxanthin (the accessory pigment that gives the organism its yellow-brown color) It is another carotenoid.) <br>  <a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/browns/phaeosy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/chromista/b...</a><br>  Green algae (chlorophyta)  use chlorophyll a & b plus carotene in the same proportion as plants.

Fmo4ZgYjaa	Hello,<br>  <br>  It's pretty straight forward.  You start with 39 J and then add 114 J.  The system now has 153 J in it.<br>  <br>  Now, after some work has been done (by or to the system), then the system has 163 J.  That is 10 more J than it started with, so work was done TO the system, 10 J's worth of work.<br>  <br>  If the final energy were less then 153 J, work would have been done BY the system, which caused the system to lose energy.<br>  <br>  Just think of a big jar of jelly beans.  It has 39 beans.  You add 114 more beans. Now there are 153 jelly beans.  Later, you count them and there are 163 beans.  That means that 10 beans (Joules of energy) were added to the jar (system).<br>  <br>  Good Luck on the Test.

V8jIAEmBaa	I'm puzzled that you've widely heard the SVD is flimsy. Everything I have heard is that it is a solid, durable, easy to use weapon. It is not too heavy at 9.5 pounds.<br>  <br>  SVD's were made under license in China, Iraq, and Romania, but I've heard that Romanian/Yugo SVD's are really just rechambered AK's. The Russian SVD has more accurate components, has short stroke cylinder, and uses the 7.62 x 54 Russian round. This is a fairly high velocity round, and should be effective well over 1000m (limited by accuracy, not energy). Reports from the Russian war in Afganistan were that rebels would engage Ruskies with machine guns using the 54mmR round from 600m+ with impunity because the AK's were unable to range fire onto the rebels from that range; while a single SVD would immediately cause a hasty retreat. Pretty clear the SVD is good past 1000m. I get 2.6 moa for 6" radius at 650ft. The SVD was a well regarded sniper rifle; in good condition it should make that out of the box with standard ammo. Realize that many AK's are shot out; after seeing 30+ years of hard service, the typical AK is almost unusable past 150m except on full auto. An SVD in similar condition won't be accurate either.<br>  <br>  The longer barrel adds about 50ft/sec per inch of barrel. It is only 24.5" on the SVD; I wouldn't cut down the SVD barrel. Long barrels have accuracy problems because they deflect when presurized, which is clearly seen in high speed videos. Heavier barrels reduce this motion, increasing accuracy.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't invest a lot of money in rebuilding an SVD, though you should certainly be able to get better than 1moa. <br>  <br>  Your cheapest alternative is probably a Remington 700 that is normally <1moa out of the box. Second choice  might be an AR style rifle. I used M-16's in the Army, and hate "black rifles", but in larger calibers, they are reported to make reasonable shooters. Try to get one with a piston rather than just porting gases into the receiver. Another possibilty would be to look at recent Chinese Type 85 (in 7,62x54R) or NDM-86 (7.62x51 NATO) or Russian SVD, civilian equivalent. Later models have sturdier receviers. Also consider the SVDS an updated version with shorter, heavier  barrel. I would like an SVU (bullpup version). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dragunov.net/svd.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dragunov.net/svd.html</a><br>  <br>  Consider hooking up with a gunsmith that accurizes rifles; a good one can quickly get you to 1moa or so at reasonable cost (sorry, you'll have to have match grade ammo). Now, the Walther with the .300 magnum is claimed to be better than 1/8 moa to 600m (bench rest in still air) - that kind of accuracy is gonna cost ya!<br>  <br>  These guys claim not legal to import SVD's, and only a few came in during the 90's. <a href="http://www.apachearms.us/2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.apachearms.us/2.html</a><br>  I might believe them, you rarely see one at a gun show. If you mod one, it will likely reduce the value. Consider something else if you can't stand a black rifle, maybe BAR, H&K SR9, or Springfield M1A. Check with some gunstores to see what they can get.

sNnWreZbaa	Tumors are usually caused by problems in differentiation and regulatory functions.  Sometimes causes include-- but are not limited to -- radiation or faulty mitosis/meiosis of cells can cause errors in the DNA, which lead to cells that have unlimited reproduction/division capacity.  Without this regulatory trait (by which the cells know to stop replicating themselves), the cells have no control and divide continually, causing a large clump of rapidly replicating cells:  a tumor.|`|pSOQTumdaa	there are so many different pathways to the  formation of cancer it is a lucky thing that more and more people don't form tumors every day.  google the following "pathways of cancer development" and look at the images.  there are so many pathways for each cancer formation taht if one thing goes wrong in normal development, it will either be benign or not.

An introductory course for scientists and engineers will require at least some simple calculus.<br>  <br>  You have to develop problem-solving skills.  The only way to do that is to do lots and lots and lots of problems.  So stay on top of your homework.  Don't get behind.

What you can't do is go into the course thinking you have dug your own grave.  Go in with a positive attitude remembering that many other people have taken the course and survived and you are just as good as any of them.  If at some point you find you are having some trouble go and see the instructor right away, DON'T WAIT.  Instructors realize that not everyone grasps subject matter at the same rate and generally are very willing to give you some additional attention.  Have fun and enjoy the course.

TL1Jkqunaa	Calcite is usually white, less commonly clear.  But it also can be pretty much any color due to small amounts of 'contaminants' staining it.  Because it can twin and often grows to fill confined areas its outward or gross shape can be almost anything, and cryptocrystalline calcite an mimic many other minerals.  It is very common to mistake less common shapes and colors of calcite for other things.  Its luster is also very variable, waxy and greasy are common.  ANd because it is soft its luster can change from one side of a crystal to another.<br>  <br>  But it is always the same hardness, 3 on the Moh's scale, and it is always vulnerable to dilute hydrochloric acid- but sometimes you have to rough up the surface to get a clean part of the calcite to put on the acid, it often has a sort of case hardened effect from reacting with things in contact or carried by water solution.<br>  <br>  Every field geologist has embarrassed himself by failing to identify this common and well known mineral.

i3PGjRRfaa	A 25 Watt bulb generates 25 watts of heat...............|`|EOqxenK9aa	A 25W light bulb gives, supposedly, exactly 25W off as heat. Well, some of it is visible light, but an opaque box converts it all to heat.<br>  <br>  So what you want to ask is how good the insulation is. A measure of that "goodness" is thermal conductivity, defined as:<br>  <br>  k = P * 1/A * x/ΔT, where<br>  P - power, A - surface area, x - thickness of insulation, ΔT - temperature difference.<br>  <br>  We'll do it all in SI units.<br>  <br>  1 cubic foot = 1 foot side = 0.3048m per side.<br>  The surface area of the box is (0.3048m)^2 * 6 (six sides)<br>  A = 0.5574 m^2.<br>  <br>  Now we know that the temperature difference across the insulation was say ΔT=57 K (Kelvins). Temeperature differences in Celsius are same as in Kelvins.<br>  <br>  We must also know the insulation thickness. You forgot to give that, but say it was 2 in = 0.0508m.<br>  <br>  So, k = 25W * 1/(0.5574m^2) * 0.0508m/57K<br>  <br>  k = 0.04 W/(m?K)<br>  <br>  The lower the conductivity, the better the insulator (duh).<br>  <br>  This is similar to hollow fill fibre insulation called Polartherm, or the best wood. But we don't know the thickness: if it was less, it was a better insulator. If more, then it's worse insulator.<br>  <br>  Certain nothing special to write home about. You need a way bigger box -- with such a small box, you're facing errors due to the edges/corners of the box etc. Run it with the biggest box you can find. It doesn't have to be cold outside to get your results, as long as the temperature is mostly steady, and there's no direct sunlight! Ideally, you want to put a roof above your box and run the tests during a rainy day.<br>  <br>  <br>  Ah - ha you wanted to know the temperature of the lightbulb? There's no such thing as "temperature given off by bulb". What do you want: the temperature of the bulb's filament (the hot, glowing thing that emits light), the temperature of the bulb's glass envelope, yada yada. The bulb doesn't have one fixed temperature.<br>  <br>  Just as you don't! The temperature under your tongue will be usually higher than the temperature under your armpit, and the highest temperature will be your core -- say the blood getting out of your liver.<br>  <br>  The light bulb will have many different temperatures depending on what part of the light bulb you're looking at. You can only approximate the temperature of the bulb's filament, but to get a decent temperature of *anything* else, you need to do pretty detailed modeling (FEM - finite element models on a computer).<br>  <br>  If you want to do some approximate modeling on paper/by hand, you must validate the simplifications (***-umptions) made in the model, otherwise you'll make an ***** of yourself.|`|a1d7afcc501bf19a8ce51cfbce1a8defaa	well it depends on the bulb size and the size of the filimant.  if it is large then little heat.... too small and a lot of heat

And it is a physical change as you heat it up.<br>  Email me if you need anyhelp<br>  Have a nice day|`|797Bf914aa	"The browning reactions which occur when meat is roasted or seared have often been referred to as Maillard reaction browning. However, lean meat contains very few, if any, reducing sugars. Furthermore, red meat undergoes more extensive browning than does white meat. The browning reactions in lean meat are most likely due to the breakdown of the tetrapyrrole rings of the muscle protein, myoglobin. Thus, the browning of meat is technically not a Maillard browning since it does not involve the reaction with a reducing sugar."|`|gUMHWrjMaa	cooking meat is DEFFINATLY a chemical change. The proteins in the meat are irriversably altered by the cooking process. <br>  <br>  Also, on the same point, cooking cannot be easily reversed - which is applicable to a physical change and so cooking must be a chemical change. <br>  <br>  as a parralell, look at what happens when you cook and egg, the white which contains many proteins is ireverably changed from clear to a white. the same happens in a piece of meat (though it is slightly different as different chemicals make up the meat of course) but the principle of proteins being alterd in an irreversable change is the same.<br>  <br>  hope this helps :)|`|a4WIK3o9aa	Cooking involves chemical change.<br>  Color changes and odor changes are often strong indicators that a chemical change has occurred.  Think about what you could observe as raw meat is cooked. The color changes from pink to brown and the odor definitely changes! Heat causes chemical changes in the protein structure of the meat.<br>  Physical changes do not alter the composition of a substance.  If you were to cut the meat into pieces the change would be physical.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you get a sweet reward :)|`|soojLVGSaa	Cooking it is a chemical change.

bae299c73e121a8a45067e0818073b1baa	Neither is better as far as your physics studies go. They are just two different correcting lens shapes that accomplish the same thing -- which is to correct spherical aberration in the main mirror to allow a wider corrected field than would be available if the scope's mirror had been figured into a paraboloid. Parabolic mirrors have sharp images that are best at the center but can degrade towards the edges. This aberration is called "coma".<br>  <br>  In a Schmidt-Cassegrain, the correcting lens (or "plate") is ground (or rather molded) to a complex curve thicker in the center and edges and thinner in between. In a Maksutov-Cassegrain the correcting lens is a *meniscus* (look it up) lens that is convex in the back and concave in the front.<br>  <br>  Because the lens cannot be manufactured molded like the Schmidt, Maksutovs are more expensive to manufacture. Maks have a reputation for sharper images, particularly of the Moon and planets.|`|17d2136cb28b3dcd96bfa98507022f5eaa	The main difference is in the corrector plate. The Maksutov's corrector plate is a thick deeply curved meniscus while the Schmidt's corrector plate is a thin complex curve. Maksutovs tend to have slightly longer focal ratios (f/12 to f/15) that Schmidts (f/10), so are better suited for lunar and planetary observing. Both do their job very well. Avoid the smaller Maksutovs (4" aperture or less), as they don't gather enough light or resolve well enough to be satisfying. I've owned an Orion 127mm Maksutov-Cassegrain and currently own a Celestron 6" Schmidt-Cassegrain, and recommend both of them highly.

qpmGLd7laa	Okay, the initial temperature of the metal is the temperature at which water boils, which is 100.0 C.  When you place it in the 69.1 mL of water at 19.8 C, it will eventually end up at 22.8 C, the same final temperature as the water.<br>  <br>  Now, 100.0 C - 22.8 C = change in temperature or metal = 77.2 C.<br>  <br>  I think the other data is there to confuse you.  The volume of the water is useless, because typically, it would be used to find the mass; however density varies with temperature, so you can't really use it to determine the mass of water at those temperatures.  Also, if you had to use any more complex equations, you would need the specific heat of the metal, which is not given....  I'm pretty sure all you had to do is realize that the initial temperature of the metal sample will equal the boiling point of water.

They have hair (sparse belly hair only) and give birth to live young. <br>  Mammals are the only creatures on our planet that make milk for their young.|`|QmrNZKYeaa	yes|`|AA10755943	They are mammals, but their reproduction is interesting:<br>  <br>  "The nine-banded armadillo nearly always gives birth to four identical young, just as humans nearly always give birth to one child at a time. However, just as people sometimes give birth to twins, armadillos will occasionally bear litters of three or five young. Despite the number, the young are always identical. They form from the same egg, share the same placenta during development, and are all the same sex. This regular production of genetically identical young makes armadillos valuable to medical researchers. (Other types of armadillo, like the giant or six-banded armadillos, give birth to varying numbers of young.)"|`|wXaGIPSPaa	here is a fun website that tells you everything you want to know about armadillos! <br>  <a href="https://www.msu.edu/~nixonjos/armadillo/" rel="nofollow">https://www.msu.edu/~nixonjos/armadillo/</a>|`|UOk0RLnzaa	An armadillo is a mammal.

AA10927246	I don't think there is a specific method called the "Cody Method". I believe what you are talking about is a specific problem involving the interior angles sum of polygons.<br>  <br>  In the example, Tia divides a polygon into triangles using the diagonals. Her method will divide a quadrilateral into two triangles. A pentagon will divide into 3 triangles. A hexagon will divide into 4 triangles, etc.<br>  Using her method, for an n-sided polygon you have (n - 2) triangles. Each triangle is 180°, so the sum of the interior angles is:<br>  180°(n - 2)<br>  <br>  Cody, on the other hand, puts a point inside the polygon and connects it to each vertex. So in a triangle you have 3 triangles, a quadrilateral has 4 triangles, etc. In this way, Cody creates n triangles inside an n-sided polygon. The only thing is he now has the triangles all meeting to form 360°. If he added up 180° times the number of triangles (n) he would get 180°n. But he needs to subtract the portion in the middle worth 360°. Using Cody's method you have:<br>  180n - 360...<br>  <br>  If you factor out 180°, though, you'll see this is exactly equivalent to Tia's method.<br>  <br>  180°(n - 2)<br>  <br>  So use either method, but the formula for the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon is:<br>  180°(n - 2)<br>  or<br>  180°n - 360°<br>  <br>  The answers will be the same.  See section 3.2 of the PDF below for more details.

Orqm4HO6aa	The voltage of power outlets is designated in _effective_ voltage. I.e. you calculate with about 120V, but the peak voltage is a lot more, approximately 160V, and that's what drive the voltage doublers/triplers. At least under optimal circumstances and no load.<br>  <br>  160V * 3 = 480V<br>  160V * 2 = 320V<br>  <br>  Looks okay to me. Hook up some load to the output and see if the voltage drops. If it doesn't drop sufficiently, put a potential divider after the doubler/tripler.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	could you tell us the input voltage? minor point...<br>  <br>  don't forget a 120 volts RMS AC voltage is 168 volts peak (120 x 1.414).

d6XAz5xXaa	I'm afraid that it probably was arbitrarily chosen. I've had a quick look at other languages to see if, for example, angular momentum starts with an L in them.  Not in French, Italian (closest to Latin I could find) or Greek.<br>  <br>  m is used for mass, so we can't use that.<br>  a is used for acceleration, so we can't use that.<br>  μ is used to denote reduced mass, so we can't use that.<br>  <br>  Some symbols are repeated in physics, but not normally if there could be some confusion between two different elements.<br>  <br>  One possible reason (and it's a bit far fetched) comes from the definition of L, which is r X p.  As it is a cross product the direction of L is perpendicular to the plane in which r and p lie, and L therefore reminds us of that as the two elements of the letter are at right angles to each other.

GiUTgnHMaa	HELP HAS ARRIVED!<br>  <br>  Vascular plants have vascular tissue (xylem and phloem)<br>  for fluid transport of materials within the plant. The<br>  non-vascular (preferred to unvascular) plants lack true<br>  xylem and phloem.<br>  <br>  and heres another perspective:<br>  <br>  The difference between vascular and non-vacular plants is that, vascular plants have tubes that carry water up the plant/tree, non-vascular plants dont have those in which case, they need to live near water. Vascular plants are considered the "flowering plant", non-vascular plants have spores and don't need to "mate" with another plant to make a new one, they just need to get their seeds off of them the right way. Vascular plants have a system of cells that transport water through the plant, non-vascular plants do not.

Thankfully, these have not been used in over fifty years. Sadly, they probably will be again.|`|AA11209233	Nuclear energy is immensely powerful.  Put way too simply, if you use this power for good, it helps a whole lot, and if you use it for evil, it destroys a whole lot.  <br>  <br>  Nuclear power plants are still so expensive to build that they may not be the cheapest way to boil water, but as the technology gets better, it's easy to believe that someday soon it could be.  (Boiling water and using the energy from that to turn a generator is the usual way to make electricity--the difference between types of power plants is what they use to boil it).  They are very clean--they don't spew pollution into the air and water.  However, the garbage they do produce is dangerously poisonous and needs to be locked away from people or re-processed into something else.  In addition, the danger from leaks and meltdowns is a bit scary, even though these problems are rare.  <br>  <br>  I think the biggest problem with nuclear power is nuclear weapons.  Like pandora's box, now that they have been unleashed, there is no way to contain them.  The knowledge is out there, waiting to be re-engineered by anyone with enough funding, if they can't simply hire someone who already knows about building these weapons.  When you give a country nuclear power, you give them a start on the technology and materials needed to make these weapons.  When a country that already has nukes makes new nuclear power plants, it makes countries that don't have them think that we are being stingy and keeping this technology so they will remain behind the times in science and industry.

urIm4YaBaa	Oxycodone is a pain reliever. <br>  <br>  To explain it in simple terms, opioids (like oxycodone) affect your nerve cells. The cells send signals to your brain by by releasing chemicals called neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitters alter other nerve cells by binding to parts of the cell's membrane.<br>  <br>  An opioid binds to the same sites as some neurotransmitters. They're similar enough to the neurotransmitter that the binding is possible, but not so similar that the cell they bind to is affected. Think of it like a key that's similar enough to fit in a lock, but not similar enough that it can unlock it.<br>  <br>  By binding, the neurotransmitters can't cause the cells to change, and thus the signal to the brain is cut-off. By binding to the areas needed to transmit pain signals, the cells can't send pain signals to the brain. Thus, we don't experience pain while the drug is in our system.<br>  <br>  Opioids are very good at what they do, but they are also very addictive. Be sure to take the medication only as prescribed, and only for the condition it was prescribed for.|`|q9BItD25aa	It's like a percoset and it is for pain.|`|AA12280249	Oxycodone is in a group of drugs called narcotic pain relievers. It is similar to morphine.<br>  <br>  Oxycodone is used to treat moderate to severe pain. The extended-release form of this medication is for around-the-clock treatment of pain. It is not for treating pain just after a surgery unless you were already taking oxycodone before the surgery.<br>  <br>  Oxycodone may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide.<br>  <br>  Oxycodone may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. Oxycodone should never be shared with another person, especially someone who has a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a secure place where others cannot get to it. Do not drink alcohol while you are taking oxycodone. Dangerous side effects or death can occur when alcohol is combined with a narcotic pain medicine. Check your food and medicine labels to be sure these products do not contain alcohol. Never take more than your prescribed dose of oxycodone. Tell your doctor if the medicine seems to stop working as well in relieving your pain. Oxycodone can cause side effects that may impair your thinking or reactions. Be careful if you drive or do anything that requires you to be awake and alert. Do not stop using oxycodone suddenly, or you could have unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. Talk to your doctor about how to avoid withdrawal symptoms when stopping the medication. <br>  <br>  Do not use this medication if you have ever had an allergic reaction to a narcotic medicine (examples include methadone, morphine, Oxycontin, Darvocet, Percocet, Vicodin, Lortab, and many others), or to a narcotic cough medicine that contains codeine, hydrocodone, or dihydrocodeine. <br>  You should also not take oxycodone if you are having an asthma attack or if you have a bowel obstruction called paralytic ileus.<br>  <br>  Oxycodone may be habit-forming and should be used only by the person it was prescribed for. Oxycodone should never be shared with another person, especially someone who has a history of drug abuse or addiction. Keep the medication in a secure place where others cannot get to it. <br>  Before using oxycodone, tell your doctor if you are allergic to any drugs, or if you have:<br>  <br>  asthma, COPD, sleep apnea, or other breathing disorders;<br>  <br>  liver or kidney disease; <br>  underactive thyroid;<br>  <br>  curvature of the spine;<br>  <br>  a history of head injury or brain tumor;<br>  <br>  epilepsy or other seizure disorder;<br>  <br>  low blood pressure;<br>  <br>  gallbladder disease;<br>  <br>  Addison's disease or other adrenal gland disorders;<br>  <br>  enlarged prostate, urination problems;<br>  <br>  mental illness; or<br>  <br>  a history of drug or alcohol addiction.<br>  <br>  I also know that this medication is used by people with drug problems.|`|nWyvrEX6aa	It is a painkiller.

GAel6aReaa	this is the first result for "sputnik" from google.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/" rel="nofollow">http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/</a><br>  <br>  The Sputnik launch changed everything. As a technical achievement, Sputnik caught the world's attention and the American public off-guard. Its size was more impressive than Vanguard's intended 3.5-pound payload. In addition, the public feared that the Soviets' ability to launch satellites also translated into the capability to launch ballistic missiles that could carry nuclear weapons from Europe to the U.S. Then the Soviets struck again; on November 3, Sputnik II was launched, carrying a much heavier payload, including a dog named Laika. <br>  <br>  Immediately after the Sputnik I launch in October, the U.S. Defense Department responded to the political furor by approving funding for another U.S. satellite project. As a simultaneous alternative to Vanguard, Wernher von Braun and his Army Redstone Arsenal team began work on the Explorer project. <br>  <br>  On January 31, 1958, the tide changed, when the United States successfully launched Explorer I. This satellite carried a small scientific payload that eventually discovered the magnetic radiation belts around the Earth, named after principal investigator James Van Allen. The Explorer program continued as a successful ongoing series of lightweight, scientifically useful spacecraft.<br>  <br>   The Sputnik launch also led directly to the creation of National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In July 1958, Congress passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (commonly called the "Space Act"), which created NASA as of October 1, 1958 from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and other government agencies.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  NAZIS????

The Soviet key designer, Korolyov, had a low interest in manned spaceflight. His last will especially called for unmanned exploration, which increased the schism in the Soviet spaceflight industry after his death. Because of that, The Soviet manned spaceflight consists of risky, but ingenious manned first missions, which just attempted to create political victories (Which caused the large gap between Voshkod and Soyuz program), and the similar ingenious unmanned missions to Moon and Venus (as well as some unsuccessful missions to Mars...

Even if two stars were to collide, they would be so far from our own star, the Sun, that the chance of any material from the collision reaching us is extremely remote.|`|524f656a521cc9375efb6821b1b2063daa	It's mostly "what not".<br>  <br>  The distance between stars is so large that when two galaxies "collide", it is expected that the stars would miss each other.<br>  <br>  Actual star collisions would be extremely rare, even in such a case.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  In astronomy, a star "collision" occurs whenever a star gets close enough to another, to cause a gravity shift that is bigger than the average background "noise" of gravitation pulls from all the stars.<br>  <br>  In the 1980s, there was a theory that tried to explain an apparent regular cycle of extinction on Earth, with the idea that the Sun had a companion (a brown dwarf called Nemesis).  In the hypothesis of the theory, Nemesis would have been on an orbit around the Sun, brining it close to the Sun every 26 million years.<br>  <br>  Based on the data used for the theory, Nemesis would be on its way out, and its next close pass would have been in over 20 million years.<br>  <br>  At the close pass, it would disturb the gravity in the solar system enough that objects from the Oort cloud (a reservoir of small bodies around the Sun) would fall towards the inner system and may hit the planets.<br>  <br>  Such an increase in impacts could pose a problem to life on Earth.<br>  <br>  However, the theory was dropped in the 1990s because<br>  1) the apparent regularity in the cycle of extinction does not exist (this was found with better paleontological observations), and<br>  2) the brown dwarf Nemesis does not exist: with the much improved infra-red telescopes, we would have found it quite easily (we find brown dwarfs located at hundreds of light-years and we would have missed one at 1 light-year? not likely).<br>  <br>  Since there is nothing else likely to come close enough to our solar system in the next million years, we are OK.|`|hnNyUuDQaa	I would say no.

PAlP6j7faa	Suppose you have found a region of space where you think there might be a black hole. How can you check whether there is one or not? The first thing you'd like to do is measure how much mass there is in that region. If you've found a large mass concentrated in a small volume, and if the mass is dark, then it's a good guess that there's a black hole there. There are two kinds of systems in which astronomers have found such compact, massive, dark objects: the centers of galaxies (including perhaps our own Milky Way Galaxy), and X-ray-emitting binary systems in our own Galaxy. The mass is measured by observing the speed with which stars and gas orbit around the center of the galaxy: the faster the orbital speeds, the stronger the gravitational force required to hold the stars and gas in their orbits. These massive dark objects in galactic centers are thought to be black holes for at least two reasons. First, it is hard to think of anything else they could be: they are too dense and dark to be stars or clusters of stars. Second, the only promising theory to explain the enigmatic objects known as quasars and active galaxies postulates that such galaxies have supermassive black holes at their cores. If this theory is correct, then a large fraction of galaxies -- all the ones that are now or used to be active galaxies -- must have supermassive black holes at the center.|`|IcyRHO63aa	well m8 that's why its called a black hole  its invisible and it takes over the black Color and dats why its called black hole but you can see things getting tucked into it you can see the waves off it if a black hole goes near the sun it will get some of the burning stuff from the sun and grws bigger and takes mre things|`|cwJrCcguaa	Like other things in space,Scientists first of all deduce things by mathematical calculation and also from the way the `Black Hole` effects other things around it, light for instance.

FLgDn3OTaa	Uh, I think this belongs in philosophy.<br>  <br>  It basically means that since the objects we see are too vivid to have originated in our mind then they must exist as a kind of external reality. This was famously argued by Descartes in his sixth meditation as he originally proposed 3 sources for the objects: God, the Evil genius, or the objects themselves.<br>  <br>  Since God is no deciever, he dismissed this possibility. He also dismissed the evil genius because a benevolent god, he argued, would not allow any kind of supreme malevolent being to decieve us. So he arrived at the conclusion that it could only be the objects.<br>  <br>  Then he goes on to explain that we percieve some qualities more distinctly than others, such as size, shape and texture. Even if our senses decieved us therefore, we could correct the errors using our reason. For example, we know by reason that amputated limbs do not cause pain, since the limbs are no longer part of us. The correct thing would be to say "the pain experienced in this particular body part could equally be caused by something else".
QKO4f5q0aa	The angle of the Earth's axis in relation to its orbit around the sun changes the points at which the sun rises and sets on the horizon.  During the summer months the sun rises earlier and sets later, at points that are more to the North, and it gets higher in the sky than it does in the winter months.  This makes the sun appear to move slower across the sky.  The angular change is actually the same: 15 degrees per hour.<br>  <br>  The other factor is that the Earth does in fact speed up when it is at perihelion (closest to the Sun) vs when it is at aphelion.  This makes the noonday shadow of a fixed spire change more day to day during the closest approach.  The perihelion this year was on January 4th.<br>  <br>  Edit: Fixed perihelion date.  Thanks, DLM.  Don't know where my brain got that one from...|`|QPWjtDzcaa	Astrogeek has the right answer.  All I would add to it is the research term "Kepler's Second Law."  Also, I thought perihelion this year was January 4, but that's a minor detail and I won't wager my life on it.|`|hnNyUuDQaa	It is not traveling faster. I am not sure the exact answer you are looking for but it could be that the sun does not appear as high in the sky in the winter which means there is less daylight. Or you could mean that when a planet it is close to the sun it will move faster then when it is farther away.

KSK22vHUaa	Order of operations is Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division, and then Addition and Subtraction.  When you plug numbers in, make sure you put them in parentheses so that you get the whole number where it needs to be.<br>  <br>  So plugging them in, this will become<br>  <br>  3(-2)^2 - 2(-2)(3) + (3)^2<br>  <br>  This way, when you square -2 first (because exponents come before multiplication), you get -2*-2 which is +4.<br>  <br>  It's important to put them in parentheses because (-2)^2 = 4 and -2^2 = -4.  It's different because the first one is negative two times negative two, while the second one is negative two times two.  It's a subtle difference, but it's important.

And all because of a Mayan calendar? Use some common sense, rather than being scared.<br>  <br>  The most interesting astronomical events in 2012 will be an annular eclipse of the Sun on 2012 May 20, a total eclipse of the Sun on 2012 Nov 13, and a transit of the planet Venus across the face of the Sun on 2012 Jun 06.<br>  <br>  Scientists don't expect anything out of the ordinary to happen in the year 2012, or specifically on the date December 21, except for the solstice, which happens every year.<br>  <br>  None of the "predicted" happenings for 2012 hold up under close scrutiny. "Planet X" and "Nibiru" simply don't exist. The Mayan calendar ends a cycle, but there were no predictions of the end of the world.

Any number of substances can be separated into their constituent parts using chromatography.  For example, various proteins in blood serum.<br>  The two main types are column chromatography and paper chromatography.  In the first, a vertical tube is packed with an 'inert' substance like silica, and the dissolved constituents move down the tube at different rates.  A dye is added to show where each substance has fallen to.  Paper chromatography uses a sheet of absorbent paper suspended vertically so that the bottom of the sheet is in a tray of solvent.  Capillary attraction pulls the solvent up the paper and the constituents are pulled up at different rates—sort of like the reverse of the column chromatography.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the process is speeded up by applying an electrical potential across a horizontal piece of paper.  This is known as Electrophoresis.|`|WOQAbVzbaa	Chromatography is used to separate different dyes out, so if, for example, a piece of fabric has been found at a crime scene, the scientists can take the dye out and separate it.

They make all these claims but cannot substantiate them with real scientific evidence. Parts of the polar icecap and glaciers are melting but other areas of the polar icecaps and glaciers are thickening. The environmentalists base their “proof” of the existence of global warming on the melting areas but are strangely silent, even militant to the point of violence, if anyone mentions the areas that are thickening, and those thickening areas are many.<br>  In the past, there have been many times when the global mean temperatures were warmer, sometimes much warmer and colder, much colder than they are now. Global mean temperatures are cyclical with the seasons but also with other normal cycles, as they have been for the entire history of the Earth. Scientific data from ice cores, tree rings and other indicators of global mean temperatures prove this. Human activity has never been the cause of these global temperature swings as the “global warming” advocates claim. If human activity was the cause, where were the SUVs, the power plants and industries in our historical past? They did not exist. If human activity was not the cause of these global temperature swings, what was?<br>  The energy output of the Sun is far greater in one second than human activity could produce in a million years. The Earth rotates around the Sun. Its orbit is slightly elliptical. The energy reaching the Earth from the Sun varies slightly as the distance from the Sun to the Earth varies due to its elliptical orbit. The Sun activity increases and decreases with fluctuations in the solar flares emitted by the Sun. Differences in these fluctuation rates cause increases and decreases of solar energy hitting the Earth. This causes fluctuations in the global mean temperature of the Earth’s atmosphere.<br>  In 2004, the energy from massive solar flares bombarded the Earth with solar energy. This solar energy caused heating of the Earth’s surface and atmosphere. Most of the energy of the solar flare eruptions dissipated into space. The amounts of energy ejected were massive, much greater than normal. Had the Earth received a full blast of the solar energy from one of the numerous flare eruptions in 2004, the consequences to life on Earth could have been disastrous. The higher than usual amounts of energy that struck the Earth’s atmosphere did have their effects, however, including some heating of the atmosphere.<br>  Then there is the eruption of volcanoes, such as Mt. St. Helens, ejecting dust and ash into the Earth’s atmosphere. The amount of dust and ash in the atmosphere varies the amount of energy that can cause heating or cooling of the Earth’s atmosphere. Volcanoes also eject the kind of compounds that environmentalists call greenhouse gases. A single eruption the size of the Mt. St. Helens eruption released more of these gases, dust and ash into the atmosphere than all such emissions by human activity since the beginning of recorded human history. And there are numerous volcanic eruptions yearly.<br>  The oceans are also a major source of greenhouse gases, as are trees. Trees and other vegetation take in carbon dioxide and give off other gases such as methane, a major greenhouse gas, and a host of other compounds, many of which are also greenhouse gases. Decaying vegetation also gives off methane gas. Studies of smog in the Los Angeles basin indicate that over 90% of the smog is generated by the vegetation in the area. To aid in perpetuating the hoax, however, environmentalists, aided by major news media outlets, censored and suppressed this study.<br>  Studies have shown that greenhouse gases produced by human activity accounts for around 1 percent of the gases in the atmosphere. The total elimination of human generated greenhouse gases would have a negligible effect on Earth’s global mean atmospheric temperatures. The elimination of all U.S. gasoline powered vehicles would reduce worldwide “greenhouse” emissions by less than 0.2%.” What would be the effect on global mean temperatures? None. Doubling of manmade greenhouse emissions above current levels would increase the global mean temperature by one degree Centigrade, which is within the normal range of temperature swings.<br>  It is the fluctuations of the Earth’s orbit around the sun, volcanic eruptions, the emission of gases by oceans and trees, all natural occurrences, that cause rises and declines in global mean temperatures, i.e., “global warming” and “global cooling,” not human activity.<br>  Satellite data taken over the past 25 years indicate no surface or atmospheric warming. If anything there has been a very slight cooling, on the order of 0.01 degree Centigrade.<br>  Recently, astronomers have noticed a thinning of the polar icecaps on Mars. <br>  Is this “global warming, Mars style” and do Martian SUVs, power plants, and industries cause it? Hardly, but the “environmentalists” think so. Some even blame it on us here on Earth.<br>  Global warming IS a hoax. Those claiming that “global warming” is real have an agenda other than saving the planet from human activity.

lIEUegRiaa	The main advantage to colonizing Mars is that we, as a species, will survive the end of the world (planet Earth). <br>  If we are stuck on one puny little backwater planet, then we are in a precarious situation. Any random asteroid could kill off all life. A superbug could kill off all humans. Pollution could destroy the ecosystem. Global warming could shatter our civilization. If we don't get off the world in the next 50 years or so, we might never be able to.<br>  Mars is also a puny little backwater, but isn't it better to have your eggs split between two baskets?<br>  <br>  The surface area of Mars is the same as the land area of Earth (currently, ie before the sea level rises 50 metres), so that is a doubling of the available land for human use. Not to be sneezed at. <br>  <br>  Physical strength might well be reduced, but in a lower gravity environment, there will be less day to day stress on your body, so your organs should work better longer. Besides, you'll be taller, as well as living longer. <br>  <br>  Going to Mars is not viable now. It's not going to help the economy in the slightest for decades. We might never even get there. <br>  <br>  Mars is our planet. Or it will be if we claim it before the aliens do. There's no one living there now, so it's fair game.<br>  <br>  And we aren't going to fix "our own Earth", not until it is too late. Nobody wants to reduce their carbon footprint. No one wants to walk instead of drive. No one wants to read books instead of surf on the internet. No one even turns off lights or appliances. People want to use as much electricity as they can, eat as much meat as they can, buy as many machines as they can. They don't care about whether their children will be able to live as long as them. People only care about themselves. <br>  Don't believe me?<br>  How have YOU reduced your impact on the world? DO you grow your own veggies? Do you walk places that are further than 5 minutes walk away? Do you put plastic in your garbage? How many trees have you planted in the past year?<br>  Exactly. No American wants to do that. To be American is to burn gas, use electricity and show that you are successful by buying stuff you don't need, because your neighbours have it and you want to feel good about yourselves.<br>  <br>  I guess the real advantage for the universe would be if we DON'T colonize Mars, and DON'T get off our little planet, because then we'll rot safely away in our little backwater, and never have the chance to pollute the universe at large.|`|U9DB9N8Daa	Mars is smaller:<br>  Unlimited amounts of space would not be a reason to colonize mars.<br>  <br>  Less gravity:<br>  Gravity would not be a reason to colonize mars.<br>  <br>  Getting the economy going:<br>  This would really be the only reason.

Basically, you want to make it look like y=mx+b. An example of this would be something like y=1/2x + 5. m is your slope. In my example, 1/2 would be your slope. b is your y-intercept, so back to my example, 5 would be your y-intercept.<br>  <br>  To graph, back to my y=1/2x+5 example. The slope-intercept form is preferred when you graph because it tells you everything you need to know to graph. Your y-intercept is 5, so start at the origin (0,0) and go up 5. Put a point at (0,5) on the graph. Next, you look at your slope. In this case, it is 1/2. The numerator (top number) tells you how much up (or rise) to go. The denominator (bottom number) tells you how much to the right to go. So, back to the example, start at the point you just drew (at (0,5)) and go up 1 (because the numerator is 1) and go to the right 2 (because the denominator is 2). and then draw another point (this would be at (2,6). Then, take a ruler or some other straight edge, and "connect the dots" with a line. <br>  <br>  x and y intercepts. Since you have your equation in slope-intercept form, it already tells you what the y-intercept is. Back to my example, the y-intercept is 5. Therefore, the answer is the point (0,5) for your y-intercept. For the x-intercept, you put a 0 in for y and then solve:<br>  0 = 1/2 x + 5<br>  -5 = 1/2 x<br>  -10 = x (I multiplied both sides by 2)<br>  So, your x-intercept is (-10,0)|`|DJpS9GDxaa	Check out purplemath.com<br>  It's very helpful<br>  <br>  :)|`|lFktjaU8aa	I don't know any websites about it but I know i can help, I just can't explain.<br>   just write the equation and let me..I'm a grade 4 student from Philippines
AA12139405	The graph gives you the arrival time of P wave and S wave. The difference in the arrival time multiplied with the speed difference is the distance of epicenter. The ratio of speed is 1.7 : 1. The average difference in speed is about 8 k/m for each second difference in arrival time of S wave minus P wave. The sensing time will increase depending upon the distance and magnitude. The longer the sensing time at very low magnitude also from strong earthquakes only.This what helped me to issue the warning 2 hours before Tsunami struck our coast.My earthquake alarm sensed the wave for an unusual time of 12 minutes .Therefore I said that I have sensed a very big earthquake which I never heard in the history.But local T.V.Stations refused to accept my findings. You need three seismograph to find the location of epicenter but to find only the disatance one seismograph will do.|`|LA0ztXpNaa	No, you have to use the difference in the time of arrival of the P and S waves (at the place where they were recorded)  to determine the distance from where they were recorded (for example, 50 miles). You need to do this with three different places and then you use a compass (centered on where the waves were recorded) and draw a circle 50 miles around the location (proportional to the map). Once you do that with each of the three locations, the intersection of the circles will be the epicenter.

AA10929714	This equation is actually quite easy to solve.  Start by finding the solution to the homogeneous version of the differential equation, i.e., <br>  <br>  d^2x/dt^2 = 0.<br>  <br>  You can solve this by inspection; this equation says that the second derivative of the function x(t) is zero.  That means the first derivative is a constant, and the function itself must be a linear function of t.  The solution to the homogeneous equation is therefore:<br>  <br>  x_h(t) = a + b*t<br>  <br>  where a and b are constants of integration.  <br>  <br>  Now use the method of undetermined coefficients to solve for the particular solution.  In this method, one creates a trial solution that is a linear combination of the forcing term(s) and all their derivatives. (This method only works if the derivatives form a finite set.)  If one of the members of the set is already represented in the homogeneous solution, then there is another step that must be done, but that's not the case here.<br>  <br>  In this case, the trial particular solution is;<br>  <br>  x_p(t) = c*sin(x) + d*cos(x)<br>  <br>  x'_p = c*cos(x) - d*sin(x)<br>  <br>  x''_p = -c*sin(x) - d*cos(x)<br>  <br>  Plug this into the original differential equation and solve for the undetermined coefficients, c and d:<br>  <br>  -c*sin(x) - d*cos(x) = A*sin(x)<br>  <br>  For this equation to be satisfied, d = 0 and c = -A.  The particular solution is therefore:<br>  <br>  x_p = -A*sin(x)<br>  <br>  The complete solution is the sum of the homogeneous and particular solutions:<br>  <br>  x(t) = a * b*t - A*sin(x)

VL9oXwFAaa	Flip-flop circuits are circuits that use a clock, and are able to keep track of things (i.e Memory).  They can also be called, Synchronous Sequential circuits.  They are much more useful than combinational circuits, both in time consumption to make, as well as design applications.  Typically you would use some sort of HDL (hardware design languge) to create these flip-flop circuits; such as verilog.  And you could then use what's called an FPGA board to implement and test your design.<br>  <br>  Combinational circuits are simple gate-to-gate circuits, that contain various IC's (integrated circuits), input switches, a breadboard, and perhaps a 7-segment display (or something similar).  These circuits are not used much in the real world anymore, however it is fundamental to learn them in order to create more advanced sequential circuits.|`|8Y7LQ6TGaa	flip flops are memory, they remember their state, either 0 or 1 (as long as the power is on)<br>  <br>  Combinatorial logic is fleeting. when the inputs to the logic go away, the outputs go away.<br>  <br>  .
2gjfFsYKaa	If a planet rotates, it's about an axis of rotation. This axis is defined by the rotation itself.|`|7o6FQsxBaa	A planet (or any rotating body) rotates about the axis of rotation.  But this is not an actual physical object, like the axle of a wheel.  Imagine if you toss a ball in the air with a spin -- the ball is spinning around its axis, but the axis is just the imaginary line that defines the rotation of the ball.  Planets are the same -- no physical axis, just an imaginary line that defines the spin.|`|6EXOZu6Vaa	an axis

It is also, incidentally, the ONLY rocket to have a 100% success rate, with not one of them failing during a launch. At liftoff, five F-1 engines burn kerosene with liquid oxygen to generate 7.5 million pounds of thrust between them, lifting the huge rocket off the pad. After two and a half minutes the first stage (called the S-1C) is empty, having burned around 4 million pounds of fuel and oxygen. It shuts down and is separated, falling back into the ocean.The second stage now ignited, burning liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen in five J-2 engines, generating 1 million pounds of thrust. The second stage (known as the S-II) fires for about six minutes. After that it is discarded, and the third stage (the S-IVB), powered by one J-2 engine, fires again to place the spacecraft in orbit.<br>  <br>  On a lunar mission, after a couple of hours in orbit to check the systems, the third stage fires again to send the spacecraft to the Moon. After a few minutes of firing, the stage is shut down and the Apollo spacecraft separates, turns around to dock with the lunar module, which was carried on top of the third stage just behind the Apollo spacecraft, then pulls it away from the third stage. With the spacecraft now on the way to the Moon, the third stage fires once more to push it away and avoid any possible collision with the spacecraft.<br>  <br>  The flight of the Saturn V is controlled by a sophisticated instrument unit, which sits on top of the third stage and controls the entire rocket automatically.
7332330fe5278c185ff934bc2bf5f6e8aa	The farther u go north is the north pole, which is really cold. I don't know the exact temperature but it is cold. As you go south, u start reaching the equator. The countries, cities, counties, and lanmarks close or on the equator is the hottest part on earth because of the equator sitting and going through tropical zones around the earth. Also as earth rotates, it's rotating axis makes the sun hit the equator more than anywhere else on the earth. The sun does reach the North Pole, but not as much as the equator, the sun barely even hits the North Pole at all anyway. Hope this helps!

Line up your finger under her foot, so that her foot follows your finger--be careful--it's very easy to get them both going in opposite synch, in which case you will just reinforce the opposite direction.  But if you can synch them up together (making your finger turn the way you want to see her turn, while always keeping the image of her foot and your finger aligned), then you can get your brain to see it the desired way.  Also notice that one way she is swinging her foot up in the back, and the other way it's up in the front.<br>  <br>  it's not HOW you look at it, it's how your brain INTERPRETS what you see, so you have to force your brain to reinterpret.|`|nDv2EtuGaa	Don't worry.

The wire size  and no of turns has to redesigned to a bigger size and lesser no. of turns. Kook for a book on  single phase motor rewinding.When you rewind the  wire size has to to bigger by 4 AWG size No. For example, if your motor uses No.28 magnet wire size, the magnet wire to be used is No.19AWG. The no. of turns used for the coils in series has to be reduced by the original number of turns divided by 4. The work has to be done by a good rewinding shop and might cost more than if you use a step up transformer, 110/480 volts.This transformer is available in industrial electrical supply stores.|`|c4b40d3f07535b46185ffe5fc8c3613eaa	yep, simple.<br>  You need to get a transformer to step the voltage up from 110-440 volts.<br>  These should be pretty readily available from suppliers near you, so search google rather than me posting links to suppliers thousands of miles away from you.<br>  <br>  You need to make sure that whatever transformer you buy is capable of handling the amount of power your motor requires.

It mentions it as home of Marduk (Not the home of the Annunaki, like Sitchin later claimed), and was very likely referring to Jupiter. <br>  <br>  This second myth also includes many concepts, which later appeared in the Christian Creation Myth.|`|QKO4f5q0aa	You are in the wrong section for this question.

R0Ogy5qlaa	It turns out that (r + s)^(k + m) is in Q.<br>  <br>  This is because in a commutative ring a form of the Binomial Theorem can be used.  So (r + s)^(k + m) can be written as a sum of terms of the form r^xs^y, where x + y = k + m and the terms may be repeated.  Note that for each such term, either x >= k or y >= m.  Either way, r^xs^y is in Q.  Since all of its terms are in Q it follows that (r + s)^(k + m) is in Q.

3PuKXEwZaa	It may be true that there are fossils missing. But there is much proof of evolution in that explains how the world around us operates.  If God is truth and evolution is truth then the two cannot contradict one another. Truth cannot contradict truth. Many Christians are against evolution because they see it contradicting the creation story of Genesis. The Catholic church teaches that PARTS of the creation story can be seen as allegorical and not literal. Therefore I think it is reasonable to have faith in both evolution and God at the same time. It is certainly not against Christianity to believe in science or evolution. Science helps us to understand God's creation.  The pope said that faith and reason are like two wings of a bird that lead us higher to God. A bird cannot fly without two wings.  We need both our faith and reason to understand God.|`|WVPYem5Vaa	Because it has been proven time and time again to occur.|`|a4edf2e40162015de63a4dff47980bbbaa	The odds of a dead organism become a fossil is very low.

For example the steps in the change from a land mammal to a whale is pretty well represented by transitional fossils. So is the movement onto land in the first place. Another pretty complete series of transitional fossils involves our own lineage.<br>  <br>  The fossil record isn't the only thing that supports the theory of evolution.

Therefore, these rocks have banded layers and/or they fracture into sheets. Mica does the same, but it is a mineral and not a rock. Rocks are mixtures of several minerals. Sedimentary rocks are also rather soft. Sandstone and limestone are very easy to carve with even bronze tools, which is why they were used in so many ancient monuments, like the Egyptian pyramids.<br>  <br>  Igneous rocks have volcanic origins. They tend to be very high in silica and often glass like, like obsidian. Pumice is a solid mass of billions of tiny silicate beads compacted together. <br>  <br>  Metamorphic rocks form when sediment gets subducted beneath a tectonic plate. Here it is heated by the earth's mantle and crushed by the weight of the plate above it. If it subsequently rises back to the surface it forms rocks with a clearly defined crystalline structure. Granite is the best example of a metamorphic rock with large crystals. However, marble is another metamorphic rock which forms from limestone. Limestone in fact is a fossil (all fossils occur in sedimentary rocks), but when transformed into marble, the Calcium carbonate shells of the sea creatures partially melt and reform as  crystals.|`|8d41beedea7b54aa494a0183d13589c0aa	I'll take a try at this one .

Apart from being conscious about the usage of power and water at home, one can employ pollution-free and cost-effective power solutions at our homes. Solar power solutions and wind power solutions are the two of the most efficient solutions that can replace the conventional power solutions employed at our homes.<br>  <br>  These solutions can help you combat power outages, reduce your electricity bills, and also help the environment. <br>  <br>  This article will explore the cost-effective wind power solution that you can employ at home. <br>  <br>  Wind power solutions work best when the following conditions are met:<br>  ? You have a house or farmhouse spread over a big area. Typically, wind power solutions are employed in areas that spread over an acre. <br>  ? The average wind speed in your area is around 11 miles per hour. If you stay in a place that has little wind flow, your system will not work. Consult an expert before installing the wind power solution at home.<br>  ? You need to draw water from external sources. You can install a wind power system even when you do not need to draw water from outside. However, if you need to draw water from outside on a regular basis, a wind power system offers the best solution.<br>  ? Your house needs a lot of uninterrupted power supply. Combating those power outages is easy with the pollution-free wind power systems. You need no longer worry about a break in your work because of a power uncertainty.<br>  <br>  A typical wind power system comprises of a tower and five blades to churn out wind energy. The length of the wind tower varies depending on the location of your house. You may need a longer tower if you are in low-wind zone; you can work with a shorter tower if you live by the beach. Using a wind generator, this wind energy can be converted into useful electrical energy to be employed at home for running various electrical appliances. You can even store the power generated for later use, making wind generators more efficient than convention power systems. <br>  <br>  If you are confused with the wind power jargon, here’s a piece of information for you. The terms, wind mills, wind turbines, and wind generators are used to refer to the same machine.<br>  <br>  I know this is a bit lenghthy, but it should help u understand wind power a bit better!

V8jIAEmBaa	You and OilField are both  mostly correct.<br>  <br>  Compressed air is measured at atmospheric pressure, so at 85psi has much less volume than 1.25ft3. At the pressure side of the orifice, the air has relatively low velocity. As it goes though, it loses pressure and increases velocity. Outside the nozzle, it is back to atmospheric pressure.<br>  <br>  You assume the entire pressure drop is across the orifice. This is fine for a first level course, but not entirely representative of what really happens.<br>  <br>  Speed of sound is about 760 mph. Unlikely you are over 0.8 times this, due to compressibility effects (speed of sound issue). You are not going to have enough energy in the compressed air to move it to the speed of sound. Thus, speed at center of orifice is probably absolute max of 600 mph, and air is still compressed somewhat when coming through. There is also friction at the orifice that will slow the air near the edge, so the speed across the airstream won't be uniform.|`|AA10332086	I suspect the 1.25 cfm you are quoting is standard cubic feet. You need to convert those to actual cubic feet for your calculation. <br>  <br>  Assuming the air is at 60 degs F then the actual volume of air is 1.25 times 15 divided by ( 85 + 15) or .01875 acfm. I'm rounding atmospheric pressure to 15 psi rather than 14.7 psi
Vr79EjBZaa	at this point... your better off taking any job you can find.  I was looking at some statistics and it seems that Teenagers were hit the hardest when it comes to employment.  <br>  <br>  Being 19 I cant find a job anywhere.  My dad runs a business and so far they are doing well enough to hire me for part time work.  I supplement the rest by doing photography on the side. <br>  <br>  I suggest looking to see if your friends or family can hook you up with a job. Good luck|`|sbMp44v3aa	It depends what you like and what you are good at.  Even at 15 there are a lot of opportunities out there.  The most common options would be retail - a store at the mall for instance, fast food, or something like that.  <br>  <br>  If you are a good typist you may be able to find a position with a temp agency doing data entry or something.  I had a job for 3 weeks when I was 16 doing data entry and made $15 an hour.
AA10375034	The egyptians looked at the shape of a mountain and thought that it looked like a staircase to the heavens. Also, the shape was great, but the shapes of pyramids and mountains are different because of architectural and engineering problems. (It would be risky to make it that shape and anyway, who can make a monument look like a real mountain?)|`|GwFJzMilaa	It was a sign of great power to have a tomb slanted as such.
