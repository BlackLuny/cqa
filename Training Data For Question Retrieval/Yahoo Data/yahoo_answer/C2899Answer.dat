a5ea5670347bccd43eb1324b846aff51aa	A gua potvel tem pequena concentra??o de sais dissolvidos, ao contrrio da gua salobra (ou salgada). Atravs do processo de dessaliniza??o, como o pessoal a j disse,  possvel transformar gua salgada em gua potvel. H duas formas de dessalinizar a gua: por destila??o (provoca-se a evapora??o da gua que, ao entrar em contato com uma superfcie fria, condensa-se, como acontece no processo da chuva) ou por osmose reversa.    A osmose natural ocorre quando duas solu??es salinas de concentra??es diferentes encontram-se separadas por uma membrana semipermevel. Lembra-se do conceito de membranas semi-permeveis? S?o membranas que tm a capacidade de deixar passar somente um lquido (a gua), ou solvente, mas n?o deixam passar sais nela dissolvidos.     No caso da osmose natural, a gua (solvente) da solu??o menos concentrada tender a passar para o lado da solu??o de maior salinidade. Com isto, esta solu??o mais concentrada, ao receber mais solvente, se dilui, num processo impulsionado por uma grandeza chamada "press?o osmtica", at que as duas solu??es atinjam concentra??es iguais.    A osmose reversa ocorre quando aplica-se uma press?o no lado da solu??o mais salina ou concentrada, revertendo-se a tendncia natural. Neste caso, a gua da solu??o salina passa para o lado da gua pura, ficando retidos os ions dos sais nela dissolvidos.  A press?o a ser aplicada equivale a uma press?o maior do que a press?o osmtica caracterstica da solu??o.    Os dessalinizadores s?o equipamentos que trabalham usando o princpio da osmose reversa. O problema  que os dessalinizadores s?o caros. Tratar grandes volumes de gua salobra  um processo economicamente dispendioso. Alm disso, envolve danos ao meio ambiente, pois os sais, resduos do processo, se descartados no solo tornam o mesmo invivel para agricultura, alm de ter a possibilidade de contaminar aquferos.     Ent?o, vamos economizar a gua potvel disponvel no planeta, t? Um abra?o.

The part of the cycle we are in today should have us cooling, also they happen very slowly (thousands of years- not like the dramatic warming we are seeing today). The other point, that the sun warms us, is irrelevant, we know this, and we have been monitoring the sun for centuries. There's nothing abnormal going on with it right now.

AS i have written in a similar question:  i have read that the global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm  to 379 ppm3 in 2005. and that CO2 atmospheric concentration in 2005 exceeds the natural range over the last 650,000 years which is just 180 to 300 ppm, as found from the ice cores.     on methane, another green house gas, global atmospheric concentration increased from a pre-industrial value of about 715 ppb  to 1732 ppb in the early 1990s, and was 1774 ppb in 2005. like CO2 atmospheric concentration of methane in 2005 also exceeds the natural range of the last 650,000 years which was just 320 to 790 ppb as found from the ice cores.    and thirdly, on nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide concentration increased from a pre-industrial value of about 270 ppb to 319 ppb in 2005. and it is said that more than a third of all nitrous oxide emissions are anthropogenic and are primarily due to agriculture.    so there is truly global warming. WHY WON'T THERE BE? with all these increase in green house gases... and it's sad that we are hastening the increase in global temperatures...    and it's pretty clear with the kind of weather too now... i do not know if changes are noticeable in all parts of the world but here in my place... januaries and februaries and decembers are supposedly just about cold days... weird though that it rains a lot now, it's still cold but 2 or 3 days of rain is usually followed by like 2 days of pure hot sunny days which i do not expect on these cold months... and it is just this year and the december that passed wherein there is frequent raining and then sunny hot days and frequent rains again... weird... climate change for sure...    and the greater the global temperatures increase, i believe crazier the weather and the climate itself will be!!! with the so much unexpected changes in the weather's status and severity... which can affect vegetation and animals and thereby humans because we are all interconnected in the food chain...    i have heard about this global warming thing when i was like 5 or 6 but it is just now that i am 21 and had graduated college and doing nothing recently, that i actually see this issue as some BIG DEAL... (probably because i got more time watching natGeo and discovery channel and be more informed.heheh)...and it is really a BIG DEAL too anyway...    =-)|`|QbvBRjKtaa	Only the intellectually lazy believe.
t0O71Olzaa	there are warming cycles and cooling cycles that occurs all the time. as humans we do not live long enough to see these changes personally ourselves. FYI solar flare activity form the sun is more of a hazard than man at his wost.   the point is you. just you. you can control yourself and no one else. period.   do the things for yourself alone. and others will respect you for it. but do not try to change them. respect them as well.    if you can use solar power if possible, cut down on gasoline use, recycle as much as possible. but don't put your life in danger like not using a heater to keep warm. remove all charges form the wall when not in use. turn off the extra lights that are not needed, not your security lights. and by buying extra coats to keep warm may seem to be a better choice, think again, it takes Energy too to make those coats. just think about the unintended consequences of things first.  what may be a good idea in reality will cause more harm than good.   it takes energy and resources to make everything. somethings take a lot of a single resource like paper; it uses a heck of a lot of water.   so think before you act or suggest. the solution may be worst than the problem.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	Stop breathing.

Keep your heating down to a minimum acceptable level. It is better to wear a pullover than cook inside your house. Changing the thermostats to time controlled makes a significant difference.  In summer, air conditioning need not be on full. Keeping this to a comfortable minimum saves a huge amount of power.  Use your automobile only when necessary. If possible use a bicycle in summer, it'll do you good in the process.  At your place of work, try instigating some of the above changes to lighting, heating and air conditioning.  Ask your Unions to start thiking in this direction, wage and working conditions are not the limit of their juristiction. Reducing the CO2 output of each company is also very important.   Should this affect future wage increases, this may be a price we all must pay. The savings in their energy costs will offset much of their costs.  These changes alone could save up to 20% of CO2 output !    More costly changes :-  Check the isolation of your house and, to reduce your own costs, find out what government grants are available for this improvement.  If these grants are low or non-existent, then lobby your politician into changing government policy to increase these.  The same is true with changing to better double (or triple) glazed windows.  As soon as it is affordable, change your old automobile to the least polluting possible. Currently, the cost of these are falling dramatically with discounts and special offers improving on a daily basis.    Other action you can take :-   Lobbying your government into reducing CO2 output by Power stations is also advisable. In Europe, the Energy companies have a very powerful lobby in government, that puts a brake to any changes. This MUST STOP. These companies make record profits every year and bribe the political system in their favour. So, as a voter, warn your MP that if he or she continues this policy, in the next election they'll be out of a job. The voter has the strongest lobby of all.  When enough people take this action, they'll have to listen.  This is democracy in action.  It is about time some of the indecent profits of the Power Companies are used for the good of all, not just the shareholders.|`|eJgEYi8Waa	One could re-roof with white shingles.

sSvPEf97aa	What's funny is that NOAA's Climate Prediction Center prognosticated that Alaska and the Mid West would have a warmer than average winter.  Seeing how bad they blew it, believers then state that no one can predict climate for 3 months, (that's weather) but predictions 100 years from now are dead on.    There has to be a time to give up this mantra and move on.|`|NfcaC4xCaa	What models are you talking about??    Models usually have an confidence level (how much error is within them).    Climate change (or as you called in global warming) is a natural occurrence and from ice core samples, mineral deposits and other factors they have been able to predict climates in the past. These predictions are usually reviewed by peers and then published. They have a lot better knowledge of climatology or statical analysis then you or me ... so should we trust that they have review the results, statistics and literature to ensure that it is credible?|`|0ulKsvXlaa	It is impossible to predict what has already happened, that is a contradiction in terms.  One can study things like the rings of very old trees, the layers in ice, coral growth ect. to see how temperature has varied over the last thousand years or so. With ice this can go back tens of thousands of years.  No matter who studied these things, or when and where, or how many times these studies took place, all results have led to the same conclusion.   The temperature of our planet now is warmer than any period in recordable history, including the warm "viking" middle age period.  What is of most concern though, is that this temperature is still rising at an astronomical rate.  It is predicted that the average temperature could rise AT LEAST another 3 degrees C in the next 100 years.  This is a catastrophy for us humans.  More dangerous than the CO2 is all the methane frozen in the vast Tundra that would be released when this de-frosts. It's release in large amounts into the atmosphere will dramatically increase the greenhouse effect and accellerate warming even further.     In addition are unbelievably HUGE deposits of Methane-Hydroxide under our oceans. Should these start to be released into the atmosphere because sea temperatures have risen sufficiently, then you can pretty much say goodbye to the human race.  A chain reaction will start that for us will be impossible to stop.  The more that gets released, the hotter it gets, releasing even more until the temperature on earth rises to a level we cannot survive.  Methane is one of the worst greenhouse gases known to mankind.  Scientists are urgently studying this Methane-Hydroxide, and the delicate balance that keeps it safely frozen under our seas.    If you wonder why there is so much fear about global warming then what I have described is a worst case scenario.   It is senseless to say that making our industry cleaner will make us uncompetitive, if there's nobody left to sell the produce to !!!!!!!  That's exactly what GW Bush said, the fool.|`|20f3291b9320a302e9070bf55325531daa	They already have.  http://www.globalwarmingart.com/wiki/Ima...

kqa9VFrfaa	Well U would need two layers for this like U said. For collecting the heat U want a solid material like rock, slate, tile, or those common roofing tiles made from tar and sand.  Then U would want to transfer that downward toward the living space.   Also have U seen the walls that are lined with milk jugs filled with water? South facing in winter of course. I have seen basements and green houses heated this way. The jugs of water let light in, which saves on electricity. They absorb sunlight all day to warm the water. Then at night the heat is slowly released.  This method could be applied to a roof if U had the correct underpinning and frame work. Good luck.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	steel that is painted black and an aluminium foil|`|fD7S54cKaa	copper plate painted black and a plane mirror .     copper has very high thermal conductivity compare to other metals .

I've heard they cause migraines, you need to call a hazmat team if it breaks and other ridiculous stories. CFL's are smaller versions of the large tubes that have been used for over 50 years in virtually every office building, warehouse, retail store, garage and school. They have always contained mercury, but contain less with modern improvements. There is no need to worry about mercury poisoning if you take a few precautions. Every case of mercury poisoning I've heard about in recent years has been linked to eating fish, especially large tuna found in sushi.     Just remember just because you read it on the internet doesn't make it true.|`|dUWqW27paa	Yes. When they go into a landfill and are crushed or you drop one and break it all of that crap that comes out is far worse for the planet than the energy you burn using incandescents.|`|5TKEtXERaa	NO  What everyone doesn't seem to get on cfl's is the mercury in them (around 4mg) is far less than the mercury that a coal power plant would put in the air using an incandescent. In other words with a cfl a power plant (most of which are coal based) has to generate 25 watts for that homeowner to have a fixed number of lumens. With a incandescent bulb to get the same amount of light the same power plant has to generate 100 watts or 4 times as much energy which in turn means 4 times as much pollution of which mercury is only one bad pollutant so even if the bulbs are broken and improperly disposed of because of their long life and the fact they use 0.25 times the energy of an incandescent they cause less mercury to enter the ecosystem.   The old style thermostats with a mercury switch that many people still have (some of the same that fear cfl's) contain around 750mg of mercury almost 200 times more than a cfl. If a cfl is broken yes it should be handled correctly but it is not a full blown emergency. Open a window, put the pieces in a ziploc, wash your hands, and when convenient take it to a recycling center that handles household hazardous waste. If their not broken take them to home depot.  Also roughly 50% of neon signs contain mercury(source) but if you absoulutely can't handle the mercury go with led. They can be used for task lighting and if you want to buy a geo bulb from ccrane it is the equivalent light of a 60 watt bulb and is guaranteed for 10 years which if you pay 12 cents per kilowatt is about the payback time on the bulb.|`|yec64oeoaa	no|`|CCqqTw6paa	nah they're fine|`|DtVkHxONaa	their perfectly safe   noet wrong with atall  ive used them for years with no  ill effect    its the ninja psycho killer sheep you have to watch out for  AAAAAAAAaaagh ....theres one !|`|fD7S54cKaa	the only dangerous material that CFL bulbs contain is mercury .

Burn baby burn.|`|Pi3Zv3E9aa	global warming is a natural phenomenon but i believe that humans are hastening the warming of the earth thru the aggressive use of fossil fuel that release green house gases and increase the levels of these gases in the atmosphere which increase global temperature...    if it's okay for humans to experience some ICE AGE again then go ahead but i think everyone is not cool about the idea of having an ice age because many will die... ARE we too selfish to the generations that will come after us, having them inherit some dead chamber of cold ice and reduced vegetation and source of food??     i have read that The global atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has increased from a pre-industrial value of about 280 ppm  to 379 ppm3 in 2005. and that CO2 atmospheric concentration in 2005 exceeds the natural range over the last 650,000 years which is just 180 to 300 ppm, as found from the ice cores.     on methane, another green house gas, global atmospheric concentration increased from a pre-industrial value of about 715 ppb  to 1732 ppb in the early 1990s, and was 1774 ppb in 2005. like CO2 atmospheric concentration of methane in 2005 also exceeds the natural range of the last 650,000 years which was just 320 to 790 ppb as found from the ice cores.    and thirdly, on nitrous oxide, nitrous oxide concentration increased from a pre-industrial value of about 270 ppb to 319 ppb in 2005. and it is said that more than a third of all nitrous oxide emissions are anthropogenic and are primarily due to agriculture.    so you see humans has so much contribution to the increase in global temperatures as seen from the data comparing the levels of green house gases (CO2 methane and nitrous oxide) during pre-industrial period with the levels during the industrial period. and the industrial period is characterized by massive use of fossil fuels u see... and the utilization of these contribute to the increase in green hous gas levels and thereby the warming of the earth...    and it's pretty clear with the kind of weather too now... i do not know if changes are noticeable in all parts of the world but here in my place... januaries and februaries and decembers are supposedly just about cold days... weird though that it rains a lot now, it's still cold but 2 or 3 days of rain is usually followed by like 2 days of pure hot sunny days which i do not expect on these cold months... and it is just this year and the december that passed wherein there is frequent raining and then sunny hot days and frequent rains again... weird... climate change for sure...    and the greater the global temperatures increase, i believe crazier the weather and the climate itself will be!!! with the so much unexpected changes in the weather's status and severity...  which can affect vegetation and animals and thereby humans because we are all interconnected in the food chain...    i have heard about this global warming thing when i was like 5 or 6 but it is just now that i am 21 and had graduated college and doing nothing recently, that i actually see this issue as some BIG DEAL... (probably because i got more time watching natGeo and discovery channel and be more informed.heheh)...and it is really a BIG DEAL too anyway...    =-)|`|1fee420808aabf67636dc09772eb45cfaa	Sure, many people understand that the climate has changed in the past, and changes naturally all the time.  You can see their answers here in reponse to your question.    The logical mistake they make is that they don't understand that the past change was often driven by naturally increased CO2 levels!  In other words, mankind is simply driving exactly the same natural process.      That's the danger of grasping onto the half-truths circulating around about global warming (particularly the half-truths that supposedly provide reason to be skeptical).  The other half of the truth is necessary to fully understand the situation.|`|mizPdbuAaa	Global Warming being man-made is just a load of rubbish spewed from power-hungry governments and greedy faceless corporations. Why do ALL respected scientists agree that its man-made? simple. Those that believe otherwise no longer become respected, so when we're told all respected scientist say its man-made, that's because they're all one-sided. The globatologist community is another example. You can't become a member if you don't believe that GW is man-made. therefore, our two-most "reliable" sources are in fact a bunch of one-sided scientists, so therefore we the masses are given a one-sided view.    Another reason is that this benefits the governments. They can impose stealth tax and congestion charges, whatever you fancy, under the pretense of global warming, and this increases their revenue. A lot of scientists and and scientific organisations are state-funded, so think of this like a product. The government is advertising global warming, and they have their own "in-house" scientist to back up the facts, and there's no independent scientist that can prove them wrong.    Pushing the boundaries of conspiracy and anarchism I know, but this can also be attempt on our governments to crack down on our freedom of movement. Soon we'll only be able to move on public transport, to certain, specified places, and we can be kept in certain areas.    Moving away from conspiracy, you will find that the Earth follows a 2000-year cycle, with peak height and cold every 1000 years. The Vikings didn't name Greenland because it had no grass, they named it because back in the early centuries after the fall of Rome and the beginning of Feudalism, the global climate was hot, so Greenland was covered in grass-unless of course the Vikings did have an impeccable sense of sarcasm-and there was not a single car in sight.|`|8ivnzNi5aa	There is a volcano in Antarctica called Mount Erebus.  This is constantly spewing forth all sorts of hot gases.  Also, there's Mount Kilauea in Hawaii, which is always popping off.  These are putting more pollutants in the air than all of the world's cars and factories combined.  Look it up in Wikipedia.  Also, what makes people so sure that global warming would be a bad thing?  The Earth has been through warming and cooling cycles more often than anybody can imagine.

The problem with your statement is that there has never been in the history of the earth the concept of a static climate.  The climate changes all of the time.    So this is not a question of has the climate change, but how much, how much are humans responsible, will the fute rise in temperatures (if any) be something that we should be concern.  Over the past century temperatures have risen 0.7 degrees and civilization has prospered.  Our standard of living has gone up.

The idea that we're causing the Earth ot warm up-- or is that cooling down-- wait, now it's stable.  Anyway, the past several years have taught me that this is all BS.  How many times do we have to go through cycle of heating and cooling to realize that nothing is wrong with the weather?    We may not like 42 below, and we may not like 92 above with the same humidity.  But just because the weather and climate doesn't do what we want it to do, doesn't mean there's a problem caused by man.      Climate is cyclical!  I've seen it.  Years of mild temperatures in the winter, back to freezing cold.  Years of heat in the summer, back to more mild temperatures.  This winter is no different than what they were talking about in the 1970's with "heading into a mini ice age and we're the cause of it."|`|sSvPEf97aa	Science doesn't care what you believe.

CO2 levels have risen 0.01% since 1800.  There is global warming on Mars too and no SUV driver.  The cover story on TIME magazine in 1975 was about the threat of global cooling.  Scientific consensus is an oxymoran.  The Argentinan glacial ice is expanding 10m a day.  This was Europe's coldest winter in recorded history.  The mean global temp has not risen since 1998.

ICE launched a $500,000 advertising campaign to, in ICE's own words, "reposition global warming as theory not fact.")    There are already two answers here, one says there is global warming on Mars, which is untrue, it's localized and based on one year (1).
