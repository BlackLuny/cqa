20090309155536AAzLrTg	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	!! =D okay i have 2 quick  questions... that i want  answered thoroughly?	alright i was wondering what kind of skateboard i should buy. Im begininer and have not even began yet but my boyfriends going to teach me. [sorry] anyway so hm.. what kind of skate board should i get? I'm going to do my research so tell me something i might not find out. Or save me time..tips. [not tricks jeez] :)    also.   i have an electric bass and i was wondering if i could exchange that for an acoustic guitar. I've learned how to play the acoustic but the bass and I are just two separate worlds. Especially since i  like acoustic sounds and like to sing along with the guitar.    Thank you for being so helpful anyone!

20090309162039AAt62vM	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Curious about these top contributors?	Okay, so I am on level 2 or something...have a little over 600 points. I've been here a while and answer some questions every now and then when I am bored. But I look around at some of these people who answer THOUSANDS of questions and are like on Level 8 and 9...that is crazy!!! Do these people just stay on all day? How do they have the time to answer so many? Is that very much of a life...sorry, but just being honest...Answers from top contributors themselves would be great, but if you aren't one go ahead and give me your opinion too!! :)

20090309172108AAnjEq6	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Answers	Will they know if I comment?	I answered a question and was chosen as best answer.  After choosing my answer the questioner asked me about something I had referred to in my answer.  This person doesn't allow email and, since the question is now resolved, I can't add to my answer to explain it to her.  I told her she could email me for an explanation using the 'comment' section under the question, but I don't know if she will see it.      Does the questioner get notified if someone makes a comment on their question once it is resolved? Otherwise I doubt anyone would ever look back for comments.

20090309165335AAyte3V	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Problems with Service	Do you find that you simply cannot reply quick enough to a persons question?	I want to answer so many questions but unfortunately people feel it is a race against time and feel the need to answer something without thinking their answer through first! Not only does this mean answers are rushed but it makes it hard for people like me who like to give 'substance' to an answer but no-one reads it if it is not within the first ten or so replys. How frustrating!!!!

20090309164437AA9P89p	Yahoo! Products;Yahoo! Mail;Accounts & Passwords	Is there a way to recover my Yahoo Email account without my Birthday?	okay basically i have an email account that is somewhat very old =/.       The thing is i can't access it because i sorta forgot the password. I tried extending it longer but the funny thing is that i confirmed the wrong password during registering a new password.      Anyways, i know the secret answer to my account but i don't have the Birthday, because at the time when i made the email account (the one that i forgot the password to) i put in a wrong birth date.      But it has all my information just like this account... just not the right birthday. I would run through all the days meaning 365 tries, but it could take awhile and it could banned the account that i want back.      so is there any way or who i can talk to about this?
