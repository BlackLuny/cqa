I have one on my Co Car and have had one on every car for the last 8 years, they don't use them to spy on you, it is in case it gets stolen.    Some people will wind you up and they are spying on you but they are not - or maybe they are!!!!    Anyway when it gets fitted watch where he fits the box and then unplug the antenna it dont work then.    Most of these things are not live tracking and only come live when pinged by the police / tracker company.    You should be paying the tax man a chunk of money for the privilege of doing personal miles - i do about 15K personal (fuel paid by company) a year in mine and dont think twice about it.    Get out and drive..........

SjDVMh3Uaa	I bet your local dealer can help you. Look in the phone book and give them a call.
8GDBr2U9aa	Didn't you ask a question like this 2 or 3 times yesterday? Do not paint a leased car! It doesn't belong to you. Would you paint your neighbor's house because you didn't care for the color? My guess is no.    Besides, the dealer probably doesn't care what you do. They've been paid for the car by the leasing company and have nothing to do with it anymore.|`|51d9e39c71aaaed7424c9ac49e9069c5aa	It's certainly OK to ask - the worst they can say is no.|`|mTwn8p79aa	The answer will automatically be no.    But, the real question is why do you want to paint it?    Is it just to change the color?  A decent paint job will run at least $4,000.  They'll never let you do the $200 maaco job with paint all over the edges of the windows and trim.    Is it because there's a problem with the paint?  The car should still be under warranty for this.  Take it to them and tell them to paint it.|`|379b18fddd29f1b64385008f275bdd61aa	The dealership doesn't care if you do. What makes a difference is the terms and conditions of the lease. Read the part about modifications to the vehicle. It will tell you what can and cannot be done without violating the lease. I would not recommend making any custom touches or modifications because they cannot be easily undone prior to returning the vehicle to the company that actually owns it. Remember...when you lease you are just paying to borrow the car. It isn't yours.|`|RbsRpcIyaa	As SkyPilot mentions, the dealership has no say in what you do with your leased vehicle.     If you've already signed a lease agreement, then you need to read it. It will tell you. However, coming from years of experience, it is NEVER a good idea to modify a leased vehicle.|`|TJMpKqFNaa	You can always ask, but I'm guessing you're right and they're going to say no.|`|wSZGdl7zaa	Everyone is missing the point on this question or I should say the question is misdirected.  The dealership is not involved now and does not care what you do to the vehicle unless they are the leasing company.  Leasing is a way of financing the vehicle and the dealership has been paid for the car by the leasing company.    The leasing company will care what you do to the car.  You can add accessories to the car but you can not change the color of the car.  If you were looking to paint the bottom six to ten inches of a of the body on a pick up truck, something that is a factory option, you would be ok.  Completely changing the color of a vehicle is a no no.      The only other possible scenario is if you were planning on buying the vehicle at the end of the lease, then it would be ok to paint the vehicle!    Please e-mail me with any further questions.  I hope this helps!|`|ksFD7EoSaa	Look at your lease agreement and it will spell out what your responsibilities are concerning this vehicle. One of the main things will be no alterations and if you do they will penalize you in a big way. If you ask them, it puts food for thought in their minds that you might just try it and a note would be put on your file to check paint upon return. Best to leave this alone until you purchase a vehicle at which time you can do as you like.|`|bEurYFcpaa	Well if you plan on keeping it, but even if they say yes...I have a feeling that they will charge you EXTRA when you go back to turn it in, and there won't be a darn thing you can do about it. However, if you mean to paint it like fix a bumper to the same color...of course you can do that.|`|WwXrTQgaaa	Yes you can ask.    Yes the answer will be NO!    They would have no control over the quality of the paint job. As far as they know you could ruin it then when your lease is up they're stuck with a car with a crappy paint job. Now you may get a great paint job but they're not going to bank on that.
qjg0g5WMaa	tractors are geared very low and a larger tire gives a bigger contact of tread area more load capacity and leverage also because of the super low gearing it gives a mechanical advantage to help increase speed evample 20inch tire will roll 60.28 inches 40 inch tire will roll120.42 inches thus you can use a much lower gear and gain a huge mechanical advantage and still maintain an useable speed while bringing the rpm into its powerband|`|0I9Fm00Naa	Because if the rear Tires where small you would have a low rider ?|`|Hqan62xzaa	Because the real wheels are the drive train and it prevents the front end from coming up as easy when plowing or doing whatever.|`|AXNkmdbKaa	Because that makes it look cool.  And gives better traction when earth cutting attachments are mounted on the back.  Especially on a two wheel drive tractor.|`|ksFD7EoSaa	The tractor was designed to provide immense pulling power and it requires a great deal of traction to pull those heavy objects. Thus you have very large rear tire that won't easily sink into soft dirt and light front tires that won;t dig groves into the fields as they go down the rows. This creates light steering and very heavy traction to pull with. To permit better steering counter weights are used to add more weight to the steering for better control.
gXSLhBzEaa	It depends.     If you entered the claim in through YOUR insurance you will have to pay the deductible to have your car fixed, then your insurance company will go after or subrogate against the other person who was at fault.  If your insurance company gets any money back from the other insurance company (who accepts liability for their driver being in fault for the accident) you will be the first person to get your deductible back.  Sometimes this process can take 1- 6 months or more to get your $500 back from the other insurance company.     If you entered the claim in through the other person's insurance, no you do not have to pay a deductible, but your insurance company will not be involved with the claim and you will have to do everything.     Hope this helps.|`|7BwKdVfTaa	No if she it you i don't see any way that you would have too pay for the accident.|`|QpOisCaQaa	Only if she doesn't have insurance, but she does so what you need to do is call her insurance and file a claim. You don't have to pay for anything and don't agree to.

Then comes your parents trust... either after you've taken the required instruction, just before your next wheel test, just after you've got your license, or after several more hours of instruction AFTER getting your license.  Or after if you can afford the damned insurance.      Yup, my parents are like that.  I'm licensed alright.

ogSUrN70aa	It's possible that you have a head gasket leaking on the combustion side of the cylinder head, that is, the engine compression is pressurizing the cooling system to the point that it forces water out of the overflow.  A good service garage has access to a device that will attach to the radiator filler neck that contains a liquid that will turn color in the presence of combustion/exhaust gases in the coolant/cooling system.  This will diagnose and confirm that suspicion.    A cylinder leakdown test will further confirm which cylinder/cylinder head is leaking.  Then you can get that classic back on the road.  I've got a soft spot for that year/model/engine.  My dad bought one new, and I kept it for years after he died.

PSQvGW4Uaa	No you don't get a warranty through little dealers unless the car is under the factory warranty still.    I would go to craigslist. The ability to talk to the owner straight up, find out what's been done to the car, what it needs, how it's been treated (juding from looks of the seller) is hugely to your advantage in finding a nice car. When you walk into a small dealership, who knows where it came from or what's been done to it and the salesman sure aren't going to give you a straight answer about it.  Also, prices seem to be much better off CL, and you don't have to deal with salesman.

AA11293043	I've thought about this one a lot, actually, and I don't agree with the answerers who assert an immediate and unrecoverable spin would ensue. Reasoning is as follows: an extremely high-performance aerobatic aircraft such as an Edge or Extra is already hovering around a thrust:weight of 1. Minus a wing including some fuel, that's shifting the ratio further in the thrust direction.    Now, depending on which wing you lost, you could use gyroscopic forces off the engine to compensate for loss of aileron to some extent. You wouldn't get your lift back, but you'd have at least something to work with. These kinds of ships have >huge    It would take a great deal of skill, but in terms of physics, I wouldn't be so hasty to say 'impossible'. In fact, if I remember correctly, that's exactly what the guys from McDonnell Douglas said when they first heard about Zivi Nedivi.    If someone wants to challenge my reasoning, go ahead. This is an interesting thought experiment and I will be happy to discuss further.|`|0I9Fm00Naa	You can kiss your %@? By By , You may be able to get away with it on a partial wing but i seriously doubt you would be able to survive With a total loss of the wing.|`|km9cQNAXaa	Certainly survivable in a Cirrus SR22 or any other type fitted with a ballistic recovery system.    Possibly survivable in the DH-82A Tiger Moth or similar biplanes if it is the top wing that is lost.      Ian M|`|mR5ZtjqWaa	The Israeli F-15 landed because of high thrust to weight ratio and lifting body characteristics.. This allows to plane to remain in control and manage level flight.    Somehow, I don't think a smaller private plane would fare well with the loss of a complete left or right wing. Small private plane wings develop somewhat more lift than fighter planes which rely on their higher speed to develop more lift, so the tendency of a roll would be, I imagine quite harder to counter than in the F-15 with large control surfaces and double rudders and high speed.    look at this:  http://www.metacafe.com/watch/128829/pla...    I did have the luck to ride shotgun in a CRJ  FMsimulator and one of the scenarios was partial loss of the wing. So basically, the outer 1/3 of the wing flies off, you lost hydraulic pressure and have to isolate systems or switch over. It isn't too bad (in the FMS anyway). Came faster than normal with no flaps, and you were fighting with the controls for the first few initial minutes. But as we got set up for approach, things calmed down and we worked into a rhythm that got the plane down.  Any twitch of any of the control surfaces meant instant and violent reaction from the plane and you needed to give a 30 seconds of intense concentration to tame it again.   Afterward, I asked the guy about a entire wing falling off, and he, as any good PR guy would say, said that it was impossible and left it at that. But as I felt it, if the entire wing went, there would be no way to prevent it from flipping and or rolling. Rudder was already fully deflected and aileron very close to fully deflected and stall tone blaring. A full wing loss would be very very bad. I don't know about the other planes, but CRJs are extremely sensitive to yaw and pitch, which combined with the loss of a wing, also means crazy roll tendencies.  So, no, total wing loss in a CRJ, not survivable.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	The F-15 is part lifting body too.  Unless you have a ballistic parachute as previously mentioned or some other lifting type body (15, 16, 22, etc.), no chance at all.|`|3DOSC68naa	Loosing an entire wing, there is no chance to survive, since the aircraft will spin in the air. Only if you got a parachute u can make it..  Also the F-15 is part lifting body|`|zlPAVkUBaa	You will come in with the plane, that is not the problem. The problem will be finding all the parts for the body bag.    Not plausible, not probable, not possible.|`|AA12330575	Any standard, piston driven aircraft that loses an entire wing will immediately enter a spin from which it would be impossible to recover.  Without a parachute, everyone on board would be doomed.  3500 hour flight instructor.|`|XsZsk55Jaa	The other posters covered it quite well regarding how much lift an F-15 generates from its fuselage.  Something not mentioned is that the F-15 employs differential tail (stabilator) in addition to ailerons for roll control which gives it absolutely amazing roll performance.  I doubt that any other aircraft in the world today has enough roll control to remain level missing a wing panel.
EmgiGg17aa	It has both.   The car has strut suspension( a tube with a coil spring on top)  Inside that tube is the shock.   Shocks stop the car from bouncing on and on after you hit a bump or pot hole or dip in the road, or step on the brakes.

If you want the car to be physically warmer inside for your own comfort than sure.    Nowadays people confuse warming up their cars for themselves versus why in the 70's and 80's when you warmed up the car for engine performance and safety.  All the reasons you used to have to warm up a car have been addressed through advances in technology and performance.    People now really only warm up their cars for cabin comfort, unless they have a really old car.    If your car is a Diesel (which its not) the answers would be different.|`|qZ0310yVaa	you sound like my wife yes you have to not long if it is warm|`|A5PhW8nraa	only if you want to but it really doesn't matter because if you don't warm up the engine it will warm up faster as you drive off|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Would be a positive thing to do.|`|ba7a44b7d91af5fa55ba04e5e48f373faa	well if you don't want to freeze to death before the heat kicks in,yes|`|4QdiXs03aa	When you come right down to it, warming up is a personal preference really. Once the oil light goes out after starting you are getting full oil pressure, I usually let the car run for about 30 seconds on cooold days, heh heh, just to make sure.|`|GpWT465Iaa	its always good and safe to do that. cuz some times your block can blow. so its better if you do
57129a726b95061531a862a37ebbea17aa	sounds like a dead short or a switch that is stuck in the on position like a brake light switch etc. just need to trace it down.
qjg0g5WMaa	yes fix it|`|uwRkw4vmaa	Yes, and in addition sounds light the auto tensioner has lost its ability to keep the belt tight.  There is a internal clock spring in the tensioner, if the problem was sudden, the spring probably broke, and if the problem happened over time (which is what I suspect) the spring is just weak and dose not apply enough tension to keep the belt tight.  Either case you'll end up replacing the tensioner, and you should replace the belt as well, because it has been slipping and will have high spots.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Yes, either the belt got stretched, or the tensioner let go, and thus making the belt feel loose.

hMkb7H31aa	Insurance rate is determined by the value of the vehicle - not just by the number of doors.  The value is dependent on the age, miles and overall condition.    In some cases, the location of the vehicle is also a factor in computing the insurance rate.  A vehicle located in NYC would have a greater risk for damage than one driven only in Montana.|`|f038db3294ca7b44e88aa5770e91bbdbaa	It depends on the individual model. Sometimes a 2 door version of a particular model might be more expensive to insure that the 4 door version of the same vehicle, sometimes they're exactly the same.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Yes, and there are other factors to consider.  Size of car, driver age, and so forth...|`|tRUoj8cPaa	No, it depends on the age of the vehicle and its value.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Sure does, 2 doors are considered a sports car and 4 doors are family cars. Because sport cars are more to insure than family cars to insure, you can expect a higher premium. on the plus side color has no bearing on the cost to insure, the insurance company doesn't even ask the color, so it is a myth that red cars cost more to insure than white,blue, silver and so on.|`|A2V7mB4waa	You can compare how the insurance quotes would change, for example here - carinsurance.enacre.net|`|UJe2PY4Caa	im not sure i just know that newer vehicles are more expensive to insure also insurance is more for guys
oCMrcnu0aa	For a couple of , you can buy a 'colour restoring' polish for a range of colours, including a black one.  It is very mildly abrasive, like T -Cut but also leaves a coloured deposit in the scratch, helping to conceal it.|`|0686da9d2bacf24803b5de82b803a52aaa	'Who left that bloo@y trolley there!?.'|`|8468bdfd89a4b2535048ee892787ee1aaa	Pass your fingernails through the scratches.  If you don't feel them, they can be polished out.  If you feel them, the panel will need to be repaired and painted.  I would recommend going to a reputable auto body shop for an estimate.|`|iaHM24Xjaa	Sometimes small scratches such as these can be got rid of by simply giving the area a good polish.|`|4biGrjPkaa	T-Cut for fine surface scratches.    Colour magic or black colour wax works for slightly deeper ones too.    If its just to hide them when you hand the car back, a black marker pen or boot polish but it'll be nearly impossible to make it look perfect.    Get the car really dirty before you take it back!    Or you could just come clean and tell them what happened, if you try to be sneaky about it and the garage find the damage they could make it a costly repair and charge it to you! Is the courtesy car on their insurance or yours?    hope this helps|`|M6pjHtx5aa	You can go to Halfords and they sell little bottles of car paint which you can put on and you wouldn;t notice there is annything there.|`|jGmMoPrsaa	Being a black car any bodge job will stand out like a sore thumb,i know i do panel beating and spraying|`|dAn9koABaa	try TCUT you can get it at halfords its good to remove scratches ,good luck|`|WwXrTQgaaa	try a black Sharpie marker|`|qjg0g5WMaa	go to a detail shop
AA10451854	Yes, and you need to work on your driving skills better, especially knowing when to make a left or a right turn, and stopping at the red light and stop signs.|`|r5K5KgLpaa	If you've failed the drive test X 3, you permit is now gone.  The examiner should have kept it following the final test.  You MAY NOT operate a car (even with an adult) until you've applied for a NEW permit.  This will require a new fee and passing another written test.    After failing the drive test twice, it should have occurred to you to call a driving school for help.  There ARE instructors that can point out your errors and help in correcting them.  You will NOT have to wait six months once you receive your new permit; you may schedule another drive test immediately.  HOWEVER, BE SURE YOU'VE PRACTICED with an experienced instructor BEFORE taking the test again!
OcCMzT0uaa	Bob Gardner's' book "Say Again Please " helped me tremendously when I was training.   http://www.amazon.com/Say-Again-Please-G...|`|65Rzxlv2aa	What's so hard about getting the approach, tower and ground frequencies off the ATIS and then calling them IN ORDER using the aircraft NC number for Identification... that's almost a no brainer.|`|c778305da00a53fc785eff6eb33cddecaa	Liveatc it's cool... but if you really want to "loose your tongue", I highly recommend: 1.Buy a set of walkies talkies. 2. Find someone in your family or friends. 3. Practice with them. 4. If they don't know anything about aviation, write all down for example the ATIS or something like that...    Hope it'll help you|`|FGlSULkxaa	I am not entirely sure of any online websites, but if you have a copy of a current FAR/AIM, (if you do not they are fairly cheap, or I'm sure you can find one where you are doing your training)  Chapter 4 Section 2 talks about Radio Communications Phraseology and Techniques. This should be a good help for you.|`|3DOSC68naa	By Flight Simulator X.  It has helpful articles but parallel u can practise|`|DvlwN9kdaa	Find what there is to say, and the correct phrasing, in the FAR and AIM.    Write down what you're going to say.    Listen to channels of interest on a cheap radio or scanner.|`|nLOl2nCcaa	Try this:  http://www.liveatc.net/  my instructor recommended it to me when I was struggling with radio calls and English being my second language... now that's a V1T|`|wt3gpKEqaa	As a military pilot I struggled with the fast and furious ATC. I found that I could easily forget calls or couldn't remember all the details in them.    I used flight simulator a lot to practice flights and say calls out loud, or I'd walk a flight around the hangar saying calls out loud at appropriate times. When trying to remember calls, I cut out the non-essential words and remembers things like: QNH 29.94, wind 240@10, cleared land on 23. Rather than the whole sentence.     Knowing what is coming helps, as does knowing what your next call is in advance. It's part of staying ahead of the aircraft. So when you're in a cruise at altitude, you know the next part will be descending, so prepare for what is necessary on the radio in your head as well as any checks. If your check pnemonic doesn't have an R for radio, add it yourself. If you then run through your checks, make the R at the end the time for you to prepare mentally for your next call. Of course though, always remember the golden words: "aviate, navigate, communicate".    A few links that might help:    How to talk properly:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voice_proce...    As stated above, knowledge of the FAR AIM helps. Here is a direct link to the appropriate section:  http://www.faa.gov/airports_airtraffic/a...
i5lk5eN2aa	Air is getting past the MAF sensor. There is either an air leak in the induction system between the MAF sensor and the throttle body or there is a vacuum leak somewhere.    *Edit note: A propane soldering torch will make short work of finding the leak. Start the engine and let it idle. Then turn the propane bottle on but don't light the torch nozzle and then run the torch nozzle along the air induction duct between the MAF sensor and the throttle body and listen for an increase in the engine rpm. Propane gas will be drawn into the engine wherever there is a leak and that will cause the engine rpm to rise slightly. If you don't find a problem there then do the same along all your vacuum hoses and fittings, including the brake booster hose and PCV hose. If you can't find a vacuum hose leak and don't get an increase in rpm then run the propane nozzle around the throttle body base plate and the intake manifold gasket. Be thorough and listen carefully for a slight rise in the engine rpm at any spot where the propane gas is drawn into the intake system.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	U change only one O2 sensor?  More and likely change the wrong one.  As most cars now, will have 2-4 sensors in the exhaust.|`|eCG0lpIDaa	Try cleaning the Idle Air Control valve (IAC) found in the throttle body. This causes the idle to sputter or die upon start. Also check your throttle position sensor - this can cause your idle to rev up at idle or while running. Use a good code reader and not the generic ones as they tend to be generalized and not pinpoint the exact fault - MIL code
cXCnszhPaa	This has happened a few times to my Ranger.  I finally discovered a weak starter solenoid, on the firewall between the battery and the starter.  Hope this works for you.|`|v4BTTvfZaa	It actually sounds like you have a bad/dirty connection to the battery.  Try making sure all the connections are good and clean.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	sounds like a flat spot on the starter next time you get nothing take a small hammer and hit the starter  a couple of times and see if it starts, you may want to change the starter. You may also want to check the wires making sure they are tight from the battery to the starter.
qjg0g5WMaa	believe the dealer they dont put seperate regulaters in newer cars take your alternator to someone else or buy a different one|`|uwRkw4vmaa	Just a quick input, telling me that the battery is new, dose not rule out that possibility that the battery is bad.  BTW I don't believe that there are 2 regulators, at least not for the charging system.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Change the alternator then.|`|F5IZpipXaa	you can get a free test done on the alternator or do one yourself with a multi meter, that will rule it out,good luck.

The condition and mileage is what matters.
jW8nfcA6aa	Don't worry about it, just give it a try. I know visual exam of spray pattern is a legitimate diagnostic process in some cases.I know it was part of the process outlined in my HAYNES Manual for my old VW Rabbit engine.   Try Injector Cleaner Additives first.|`|uwRkw4vmaa	Good thought, but please I beg you not to try it, it is very dangerous, gas is extremely flammable, and you are going to spray it in who knows what direction and how far.  As stated in the other answers that is done by re builders with flow benches, using nonflammable solvents, in a controlled environment.  There are other tests for injectors that are safe and recognized to isolate bad injectors.|`|EmgiGg17aa	they do something like that, but doing only 1 injector at a time and never above the engine as sparks from the starter would cause the gas to blow.  And then you got an engine fire on your hands.     Besides that, hanging it over the engine, you could not see the pattern of the spray.(just that it came out).  BTW: what pattern are you looking for?     Besides what you are still doing is faulting the carburetor>fuel injectors (potato-potahto) - (that seems complex);  instead of the electrical system(which is the "weakest link").  And the electrical is even more complex now with fuel injectors and antipollution and computerization.|`|04B3sGCNaa	it can be done, but its dangerous, when you mix spark, air and fuel you get fire and explosion. alot of injectors are under the upper intake, intern it needs to be removed to check, most injectors can be test by ecm and resistance, i have done it many times and all ways, if you try, enable the spark in a way that won't effect the injectors. or you will get false results,|`|AA10255483	this is a very legitimate diagnostic procedure, however as the others have stated can be very dangerous.  One purpose of the injector is to atomize the fuel into a very fine mist.  All u need is one good spark from static electricity and boom.  Although it is recommended to do a cylinder balance test by energising one injector at a time and noting the fuel pressure drop, or by checking the resistance of the injectors, those two tests can lead you to believe the injector is ok, but still have an issue with the injector leaking down, or have an altered spray pattern.  In this case, you either have to go ahead and replace the injector using deductive reasoning, or in the real world, pull the rail and energize the injectors one at a time to check for proper fuel atomization and no leak down.
DyEIc0K8aa	Check you battery and make sure the connections are tight... that is a common problem.|`|uwRkw4vmaa	First check the battery, give it a full charge, and load check it make sure it is in good condition.  My first thought would be as yours, the alternator, the people that tell you there is no alternator are wrong, something has to recharge the battery.  Although with that said, alternator are sometimes, the starter in reverse, so to speak, after starting the polarity is reversed and stays engaged with the flywheel, and becomes a alternator.  There is more involved, but you get the idea, something has to recharge to battery, and you are on the right track.  Best Luck to You.|`|qjg0g5WMaa	no fix your magneto|`|s3E3KfBsaa	Is it a chinese made scooter?

M6Wm5IBeaa	it could also be to do with your exhaust    i run a decatted exhaust system on my car, and it can smell very rich of petrol sometimes, but other times its not noticeable    my project car also used to smell of petrol when it was running, but it was constant (rather than intermittent) and it turned out to be a leaky fuel pump and the timing was out by a couple of degrees    this would make me advise you to check your exhaust system :)|`|WCBSGuplaa	Obviously there is a leak somewhere. Since petrol evaporates rapidly it would be difficult to locate the leak. Since you notice the smell when accelerating I'd suspect it to be toward the rear of the tank and toward or on the upper side: Possibly the evaporative emission hose has become disconnected from the tank.    Get on a private lane (or some place where there is little or no traffic) and see if you can force the smell to appear by accelerating hard. Then come to a gentle stop, shut off the car, get out and smell beneath it from front to rear on both sides. Also smell in the engine compartment. That may help you or the garage pinpoint the area of the leakage.|`|dMrO1Whaaa	because something isnt working properly|`|hvs0J4h3aa	I would have the fuel system pressurized with a smoke machine to see where vapor is leaking from.  It's most likely an o-ring seal that is leaking and causing vapor to build up in the underbody chassis or wheelwells, or most likely under the hood.  Take it to a mechanic immediately.

My next question is--how much practice have you had? If you've been driving around with your folks for a couple of months (at least a week) you should do fine. If you fail, no big deal. If you can afford it, take driver's ed. If not, just study and get some more practice time in.

Either way, you can access the cabin air filter housing by opening the glovebox all the way (squeeze the sides so it clears the stops).    The filters are around $15 at the dealer.    Whether or not there's a cabin filter installed, make sure you're also following Chrysler's recommendations in the owner's manualrunning the air on recirculate all the time will encourage mold and bacteria to grow.

You can check my Yahoo! blog where I have posted a picture, to make sure we're talking about the right symbol;  http://blog.360.yahoo.com/blog-OKVKas41c...    Once you adjust the tire to the proper pressure,    "The system will automatically update and the Tire Pressure Monitoring Telltale Light will turn off once the system receives the updated tire pressures.  The vehicle may need to be driven for up to 10 minutes above 15 mph (25 km/h) in order for the TPMS to receive this information."|`|AA12261615	that's the tire pressure monitor and even if you do set the tires back to the proper amount of air it probably will come on from time to time,they do this when the tire pressure gets hot sometimes and rises,and then falls again,it doesn't hurt anything though,once you air them up though it will reset and go off ,but it may come on a few times after wards,its nothing to worry about though,this just means it working right,good luck.|`|1886d90ec70dd5c091ff5046d0eb40edaa	In my Toyota Prius it means a tire is low.

Ht1aY8THaa	I would not recommend that a new driver buy a brand new off the lot vehicle. I would recommend a "newer" used 4 cylinder vehicle like a honda civic or comparable. A new driver does not need a lot of power but will need a reliable easy to maintain and cheap to insure vehicle. I would recommend a 2001 to 2005 Honda Civic, automatic.|`|txoXobsAaa	acura vigor|`|0zdt6udlaa	A beat up old hooptie like I drove in high school.

AWESOME.|`|spVdpcPEaa	well, for teenagers i would have to say any kind of sport compact car. sport compact cars definitely fit the lifestyle of everyday teenagers. honda civic is a good choice, but if you get a civic it better be the Si model otherwise its not gonna be no fun. i'm a teenager myself and drive one and i love this car. my friends have a subaru wrx, cobalt ss, and an rsx-s which i always race with constantly. also these cars are good on gas, so its not just good for getting us to school and our part time jobs, it also allows us to have fun and have the joy of high speed driving on the weekends with out having to empty our pockets by stopping by the pump all the time. to me, as a teen, having a car isn't just to drive, its a way of life|`|ExreocKyaa	I suggest looking at small pick up trucks ie: Ford ranger.Two advantages. under powered and only have 1 passenger at a time.|`|e53807be9e34b50fae02ba7c73274c6baa	Ford Taurus.

Now with that said, don't let them con you into renewing it with them. You have no obligation.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	You can just let it expire.  When they don't receive payment, they will get the hint.

AA11435704	The simple way to avoid getting the shock is to take a key, hold it in your bare hand and touch a metal part of the car. The static electricity will discharge through the key. You feel the shock when the electricity jumps from your hand to the metal. By having a firm grip on the key, there is no jumping at that point. The electricity jumps from the key to the metal and you do not feel the shock.|`|OF64jyPSaa	put on one of those trailing ground straps on bu mper or frame somewhere|`|AioBp16Eaa	Hi  It is just static .

You can try some of the suggestions about static sprays, dryer sheets, etc. or you can just keep one hand on the door as you slide out so the static charge will slowly drain off.  If you don't, when you reach for the door to close it, you get a giant spark, as you know.|`|EmgiGg17aa	It is a combination of things.  First cold weather is dry weather.  And static works in dry weather.    Secondly it is the clothing you are wearing and the seat covering material.   If you wear nylon jacket and the seat has a wool type seat cover and you slide the 2 materials past each other they create an electric charge  when you touch the metal door handle or any other metal- el zappo.    Change the seat cover or change what you are wearing.  Possibly spray on some Static stop on the seat material that they have for laundry?  I don't do laundry so don't know the name exactly.  That would help.  Static happens in the summer too.|`|3XlFlYeuaa	Its static electricity due lots of dry air.

Yq2CUhtYaa	The seller is always responsible.    It is illegal to sell a vehicle without a valid, passing emissions test.    If he refuses, it's up to a 10,000$ fine, and jail time, for a fraudulent sale.    UNLESS, you purchased that vehicle as a parts car, nonrunning car, etc.    http://www.cleanairforce.com/motorists/e...    Since someone wanted to see the code for this, click that link.    Then select "what if I am buying a used vehicle".    "If you are buying a used vehicle that will be registered in a covered county,* the seller must ensure the vehicle has a passing Georgia vehicle emission inspection at the time of sale if the buyer intends to register the vehicle in a covered county."    The same is true for practically all states. Haven't heard of one that is different so far.    California: "When a used vehicle is sold in California, the seller is legally responsible for providing a smog certificate."    Etc.    It is their responsibility, regardless of how much time has passed. A month, two, does not matter. Without a valid emissions test, it was not a legit sale, and therefore, you are not the rightful new owner, until it is remedied.|`|U9bQgfY9aa	The evap is easy to fix. It generally just means you have a leaky hose going to the charcoal cannister.    In a normal transaction in most states the seller is responsible. But buying from a tow yard is not a normal transaction and the vehicle may have been sold as salvage which would make it your responsibility.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	I'd love to see that vehicle code or other law that says you can't sell a car that has emissions problems.    The question of who is responsible for paying for emissions repairs is moot at this point.  You are the owner.  It is now your responsibility to get the car smogged.    Unless the tow yard promised you a warranty in writing (unlikely), then the truck became your responsibility once it was paid for and all ownership documents completed.|`|mYfkJFTVaa	Many helps. thank you for your question        http://www.toboc.com/forum3/default.aspx...

It's cheaper than a new car or any major repairs, so consider it a blessing you have a car.

vFvI16P7aa	Are you kidding me?  Why would it offend anyone?  Do the "kids playing" signs offend you?  It just means that unlike people who can hear, they cannot hear you coming and can't get out of the way.|`|XLXncQu9aa	No it is not offensive to those that are deaf.  It was put in place to alert drivers of those in the area that do not have the full senses as we who have our hearing.  The reason why its not offensive is because those that are deaf already know they are deaf, so that is no secret.  In addition to that they also realize that there are laws put in place to look out for their own well being.  I'm sure that they appreciate those laws because without them we would not know and there would be an increase in accidents because of the lack of care.  Deaf individuals don't mind it one bit because it is important that they themselves are looked out for, and they want to be treated with care rather than ignored.|`|7f3559ac6e13d1f4904fbf38bd395141aa	Nope.|`|wpgRMjgraa	Why would it ???????|`|3yvuMkzTaa	Are you serious??? It's lets you know that deaf people are around, & your horn is useless, so be extra careful!!!
r5K5KgLpaa	You'll need the owner's signature adding or changing the registration.  I'm almost certain to simply ADD another name to a vehicle registration, you add it to the back of the title.  You then mail in the title to the address shown and both a new title and UPDATED registration will be mailed back.  However, I don't know the fees involved.  Sorry.    A note - ALL DMV offices will be closed the first and third FRIDAYS of each month.
4bGQpFB3aa	It's a great education.    UAL 811 Heavy, a 747 that blew out part of the right side out of Hawaii years ago was an outstanding CVR tape to use for teaching CRM.  The best parts had nothing to do with flying.    Everybody was very professional and got the job done.  When things were calmer, the Captain directed the S/O (Engineer) to go down and see what had actually happened.  He went down the stairs walked to the middle galley and back, bursting into the cockpit with "It's a big f**king hole!".    Sometime later while they are slowly descending into whichever island they landed on, the Captian expresses doubt that this might not work.  Understand he's been fighting full assymetric thrust (3 left the airplane and 4 quit) more than 30 minutes.  He states, "...we might not make this."    At which point our trusty S/O plays highs-speed cheerleader, "Yeah we are, we're gonna make it."    Well, but...    We're gonna make it.    And you can actually hear him talk the Captain into the positive thought pattern to pull it off.  Beautiful CRM.|`|Yq2CUhtYaa	And I'm curious as hell as to why you'd want to hear that?

It was all the wheels basically. Not the car.
uPqtcXHvaa	Could be a couple of things.    1. Could be your emergency brake is on just a little bit.  I'm sure you checked that--but it could also be the emergency brake sensor is damaged somehow.    2. Could be your break pads/rotors/drums are worn.  Sometimes when they get soft it means that you're at the limit of brake travel. Any squealing going on?    3. Worse thing could be something wrong with your brake lines or the hydraulic pumps themselves.    Best thing I'd recommend is take it into your favorite brake/tire shop and have them inspect your brakes (which is usually free).  They can tell you what's happening and then give you the option to repair the issue yourself, if you're up for it.    Best of luck.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	it could be the brake light switch. maybe it needs adjusted or replaced.|`|AA10643879	Air in brake lines.keep pumping brake pedal repeatedly or bleed air out should turn it off unless there is a leak.|`|lXgCj1RJaa	Sounds like your brake pads might need changing; if they have a warning light wire attached that is what is bringing the light on; that could also account for why the fluid level was down.|`|IaHBKA1saa	The problem could be a few hundred different things: Bad master cylinder, bad brake cylinder at one of the wheels, bad rotor, bad drum, excess runout, leak in the brake line, bad connection, bad flare, power booster is leaking, power booster is dead, pedal is disconnected, cpu is gone, and around a thousand more. Take it into a mechanic and he will tell you whats wrong with it. It's not something you can fix yourself.|`|jTHJhy2laa	You most likely have no or very low fluid in the master cylinder.This is usually located on the firewall on the driver side inside the engine compartment.Look for something that reads "Add only DOT 3 Fluid"on it's top and that will be the master cylinder.If you do have low fluid in your brakes it most likely means a leak.Take the car to a mechanic and get it checked ASAP.|`|b5018c41eade53d7d315f669b34387a9aa	Emergency brake on?

Normally either in or in front of the catalytic converter.|`|EL8xktxjaa	On that model it is located on the driver side exhaust manifold. Be careful taking it off, the heat from the manifold will sometimes melt the sensor on the manifold, in like ways "WELDING IT ON". It can be a big problem if you break it off, You will need to replace the whole manifold. The best way to take them out is to run the truck for a while and let it heat up. That helps alot. good luck!
gF8bbLv1aa	It's mandatory to have a 4 year degree to be a Marine Officer. Go to college first. From there do ROTC or you can do another Marine program. I can't remember the name of it but you go to college and in the summers you go to boot camp. The program is competitive, but if accepted you get a guaranteed pilot slot. Your local Marine officer recruiter will know the name of the program. Both paths will pay for your school as long as do well. Don't worry about your highschool gpa too much, but you will definately need to do better in college.|`|4bGQpFB3aa	You will need a degree to become an officer, and then you get to go through basic again...  Pilot training is then a year long plus follow on for your weapons system.    There are lots of prior enlisted flying airplanes as commissioned officers, do a good job and let Uncle Sam help pay for school and you'll have a fine career.|`|EMjoB768aa	U have to go threw school to become a officer. If u want to be a team member u don't have to but if u do u get more money.|`|W83qBR3Maa	You sound just like me when I was young.  What I did was join the marines and planned on being a pilot later on.  What I recommend is figuring out what you want to do more - Be a Marine - or - Be a Pilot.  There are a lot of ways to become a pilot.  Pass the tests needed (which are very easy) and you can be a warrant officer in the Army (they fly the helicopters) and you don't need a degree.  You can join the Marines and then at the end of your tour become a helicopter pilot in the army by transferring over, they were giving a $80,000 signing bonus not to long ago for Marines who wanted to do that.  I would definitely think about what you really want before setting your mind on the Marine Corps.  I loved the Marines but I love flying even more.  Follow YOUR heart and be realistic about your abilities.|`|yR75rXThaa	If you want to be a pilot, you have to be an officer. To be an officer, you have to have a 4-year college degree (there is an exception where you can have a 2-year degree, but you have to have a 4-year to get promoted beyond second lieutenant). The same goes in all the military branches.    I submit this for your consideration however- in the Army, they also have what are called Warrant Officers that do most of the flying, Warrant officers are in rank above enlisted, but below commissioned officers. Warrant officers do not require any college degrees or courses whatsoever.    Most warrant officers enlist first and spend a few years in service before going through warrant officer candidacy and becoming pilots. It usually takes at least 4 years of enlisted service and then HOPING for a recommendation for a pilot slot.    There is however a "high school to flight school" program where you DO NOT ENLIST and enter straight as a warrant officer then go to flight school. You do not require any college and you are a helicopter pilot about a year after high school graduation! Do not let a recruiter tell you you have to enlist first!!! They WILL lie to you to get their credit for recruits. I've known plenty of warrants who have no enlisted time and entered directly as Warrants and went to flight school.    If you want to fly you must be an officer, commissioned or warrant. If you enlist, you will have to wait YEARS and manage to get some college time in while you are simultaneously in the military- not an easy option. Ask about "high school to flight school" in the Army if you want to be a pilot without going to college.
2yrEjfmLaa	usually around 2000 on up. That is not the rpm of the engine, only the alternator. The engine should produce around 1100 on up for the higher current output. they produce smaller amounts at idle.|`|kXUwDLgWaa	Try, how stuff works.com    An alternator, battery and voltage regulator are the three major components of an automotive charging system.

zotCYH89aa	Everyone always raves about Optima this , yadda yadda, Optima that.  Back when I was competing and using the car as a daily driver, I destroyed 4 optimas in 5 years, a red, a yellow, and two blues. I don't mind bad mouthing them because they didn't give me warranty coverage or even prorating credit on any of them. I had much bettter luck with die-hards and what's the GM factory battery brand.... you using it sitting around parking lots alot, or just a few minutes?   What really kills a battery is excessive discharge. Like leaving your lights on all night and draining it completely, that can take away half of its rated capacity. If I was in your shoes I''d buy a reasonably priced regular battery and a "priority start" or "battery brain" which automatically senses when the battery gets about half drained and cuts it so you can still start the car.

To be safe, you could probably just duct tape it down.

Safeco is based in Seattle, Washington.  You may recognize the baseball park that the Mariners play in as Safeco Field.  I believe that it was purchased in late 2008 by Liberty Mutual.    Travelers Insurance is based out of Harford, CT.  It offers financial services, life, commercial, home and auto insurance.    The quality of service that you receive from ANY insurance company will vary from event to event, and will depend largely on the individual persons that you are dealing with.  I would say that they are equally reputable in dealing with customers.

Second if it has been awhile ck. the owners manual for recommended type of oil ie 10w30 5w30 10w40 etc. Also ck. for proper recommended oil filter. Worst case scenario you may have a bad oil pump. Which may not be that expensive depending on your vehicles condition.
wqeAeSVYaa	It could have everything to do with your driving habits.    Do you drive mostly in the city?  Do you drive mostly on the freeway?  Does your commute have lots of traffic or stop lights?  Do you accelerate fast from a stopped position?  Do you let your car warm up before you drive?  Do you accelerate into red lights or coast to them?  Do you drive fast?  Or faster than the posted speed limits?    You need to consider these questions in order to determine why your fuel consumption is high.  If you want to test your fuel consumption, you can take your car out for a drive on the freeway on an early weekend morning, and see how many MPG you are getting.  That will be your baseline for the top end.  Then you can compare how your daily driving habits effect your MPG.|`|bLjGM9yNaa	Some simple quick checks :        Look over your receipt from the last tune-up and see what was      what your repair shop replaced or operations performed.

My Uncle has a 96 Tacoma with 140,000 miles, only thing with his was the steering pump went out. But it's a 4x4, stuff happens. My cousin has a 85 toyota pickup 1ton with 302,000 miles new motor at 280,000 miles. Honda is definitely good too but the luxury for your distance driving will be lacking for sure. Mazda is american...however a better quality Amaercan car but the high mileage will suffer. Mitsubishi....what can I say....not a lot to be proud of except the evo and not going to suit your driving needs. Nissan is also excellent like Toyota.

By the way, the chances of a radiator with no antifreeze causing a tranny to fail are incredibly small.    Make sure you have enough fluid in the transmission. Low fluid causes hard shifts. A blackish-burnt look can be a sign of failure, but not always.|`|zOIgzIy4aa	you might want to change that fluid and filter again. if it was that dirty in the first place then probably the filter is clogging up again.|`|MIyMPgC4aa	have you checked the fluid since? sometimes it takes some to fill the gaps and filter leaving it a little low|`|PE1k59pcaa	you might want to change just the fluid again, if fluid was that dirty and add some friction modifier to it.  its not uncommon that a gm trany will act up after you have changed fluid & filter if it was that dirty!! your lucky it still moves most don't afterwards.

VUqlQmJcaa	Try checking the fuel rail that supplies fuel to the injectors.  It may be leaking, if not then you are running a gauntlet of possible problems. Keep in mind smelling gas while you're driving is not only dangerous but unhealthy on many levels both for the cars mechanical reliability and your obvious risk of combustable fumes in the cab.|`|IaHBKA1saa	You need to take your car to a mechanic and have them look at it. It could be a bunch of different problems and all of them are complex. Since your car is pretty old it will be pretty fragile in certain places like gas lines or exhaust system components. This isnt really something you can fix yourself.|`|JkTGq2BJaa	Check to see if you got a leak in the fuel lines.

EmgiGg17aa	It is OK, provided you are not hard on the accelleration or climbing a hill or towing a trailer.   If you are slowly ambling up to 30 mph on a flat road or slightly downhill...it really does not hurt the car.  However if you are doing the other - you are "lugging" the motor = driving a 10speed bike starting in 10th   gear.  You are the motor on a bike.  Basically, you don't go anywhere fast and get worn out in the process blowing out the knee joint in the process.  Car engine is the same except it blows out the bottom end of the engine(bending piston rods, and wearing out crank bearings).     So, keep mind as to what the situation is.    On winter snow and ice, you want to accelerate slowly, and doing the missed gear thing will allow you to move forward without spinning the tires.|`|eESXiy7paa	no worries mate....a close ratio trans has small steps between gear ratios... manual, permits driver to select which ever gear is appropriate..won't hurt a thing|`|DV4xyeChaa	your car go ahead...cant see it hurting,,,maybe a strain on clutch but no biggy|`|Jhw53tCMaa	its not healthy for your transmission and will build much more wear on it since your are slipping past second gear, which means the teeth have to find the third gear and you could break one of those teeth off, which would cause your transmission to start slipping|`|AA11619843	first try getting some spelling lessons or use the little spell checker that's on the screen after you finish your question.    second.    your car, your money, your time,  when you have to fix things on it later down the line.  if you only do it once every 3.2654 yrs.    not a problem.    there's a reason why the factory made a "2" between the 1 and 3.
AA11823124	Usually the Turbo back exhaust is a performance modification and either deletes the catalytic converter or replaces it with a higher flow unit. Also the exhaust diameter can be bigger resulting in enhanced exhaust flow.
nP92OdBzaa	Sounds like your firing only on 3 cylinders. Could be a spark plug, the wires or the distributor cap or rotor.  From what you say about your car, you are really neglecting your regular maintenance. You should have a tune-up done.  And why are you driving around on a tire that is extremely low on air? Just go to a gas station and put some air in it|`|KuWLNfYbaa	Sounds like it is misfiring---running on 3 cylinders or even 2,Check your spark plugs,ignition leads,distributor cap for electrical shorting and correct functioning due to the snowy weather---shouldnt be expensive--30 or so|`|YsQQ30YJaa	Sounds like you might have a fouled spark plug.Cheap fix, just get new ones.  Otherwise you might have a bad rod bearing. In that case the engine is toast.The one thing that will kill a Japanese engine is not changing the oil.|`|Ht1aY8THaa	My guess would be a vacuum hose got loose, or your timing is off. I would also guess that either now or soon your check engine light will come on. If it is neither of the two things i suggested looking at, take it to an automotive parts store and ask them if they can run a diagnostic on the car. It should be free to do and it will tell you what is causing your engine light to come on. Good luck with your car.|`|hRrCAewyaa	Could be a variety of a couple things.  I would take it to somewhere ike Auto Zone.  They will put it on an analyzer for free.  My bet is that you have a dead cylinder due to a bad plug wire or something else in the high voltage electrical system.  It could also have an emission related issue but again, Auto Zone can use their analyzer and tell you what is going on.|`|9a3ff9a2a71f177aa3fcdaaa033b1902aa	not to be sarcastic but you need to change the oil, unburnt fuel makes the oil turn black, this also creates fumes in the engine that can be picked up by internal sensors causing the engine to start running lean (less fuel into the combustion chamber) starving the engine. The low tire can be slipping at this point also causing vibration.   So please fix the flat before you hurt yourself or someone. and try to keep up with the general maintenance.|`|wscyjkPAaa	I think the fact that you haven't taken your car to be maintained regularly is finally adding up.  You said the oil is overdue and before that it was more overdue AND you don't get your tires properly inflated.  I think you need to change your habits regarding automotive maintenance, who knows what other stuff you have done to your car.  Try changing your oil first or getting a tune up if the problem persists, get it checked.

AA11435704	The fuel does not transfer from one tank to the other. There is a switch that transfers power from the fuel pump in the front tank to the fuel pump in the rear. This will also make the fuel gauge show the level in the tank that you are using.     Check to be sure that the switch is working.|`|AA11914369	Quit asking parts stores what the problem is, take it to your local Chevrolet dealer and let them diagnose and fix the problem.
gXSLhBzEaa	Let me start by saying how very sorry I am for your loss.      Did your dad create an estate or have a will?   If he did, there is going to be someone in charge of his estate which might be your mother.      What you will need to do after meeting with the lawyer, is call the current insurance company that the car is insured with and let them know that your father passed away and let them know who the executor or executrix of estate is.  You will need to put the insurance "IN THE ESTATE OF _____ ____ (your fathers name)".   Your insurance company will need a copy of the short certificate which the lawyer should be able to provide if there is one.      The executors or executrix of estate can handle the vehicle, sell it or put it in someone else's name.   You do not need a drivers license to put a car in your name.  Your mom could probably put it in her name, but the lawyer should be able to help with this.     I'm sorry this happened to you and your mother and wish you the best of luck|`|f3cbb5ce9f2304adcda13ae360118e58aa	if you have a garage, I would put it in there. til your old enough to drive. or sell it.|`|SuZbBnycaa	In California:    If you are not going through Probate, and it has been more than 41 days since his passing you can fill out Affidavit for Transfer Without Probate REG 5, take in the title, and use statement of facts REG 256 for tax and smog exemption. You can put it in your mom's name. She doesn't need a license number. (they will code it with an "F" instead of a "P" where the number goes.   You can be listed as well, as a TOD. So if your mom passes, the car Transfers On Death to you. You don't need a number either.    If you just want to sell it...take the buyer with you and just use the REG 5 and have the next of kin sign you dad's name and theirs on the title....Do all of this at the DMV office or AAA Auto Club..signing where and how can be tricky, so it's best to get some "hand holding" thru the process.    The REG 5 states date and place of death and who is able to sign for him.     If you are going to park it for a year, then let the DMV know with Affidavit of NON USE. then it won't get suspended for lack of insurance. Or you can put it into NON OP if you don't use it for a couple of years, and you also don't have to pay the yearly registration fees.    Sorry for your loss.|`|AA11619843	you can sell the car,    wait till you get your license    or have one of your relatives change it to their name|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	It's considered property.

NPfmdsg8aa	Hold on turbo, with suspension problems that you have indicated, I would Never put that car into a turn at a high rate of speed!!!, you need to drive your car to an alignment shop, at slow speed mind you and have your rear suspension checked, it could be a combination of bad struts, bad camber adjustment,( camber adjustment is from the top of the tire to the bottom, ) or maybe even the stabilizer support system, please for your own safety do not put that vehicle into a high speed turn until you get that problem fixed, thank you.|`|HUluAQM3aa	If it is as bad as you say then you have experienced a suspension/control arm failure on both sides of the vehicle at the same time.

A family sedan with a sport feel (for a family sedan that is).  Zero Defects.  Comfortable.  Another reason I like it is it costs thousands less then an Accord.      The Accord is a winner, but you'll pay a premium for it.    As for the Altima, I know 2 people with them.  They seem happy with them.

Honda has a good track record and has been only getting better. However, the Nissan Altima is a great mix between sporty and classy. It has great power and the look is almost synonymous with the sister company Infiniti. Not to mention, the interior looks like it belongs on a $50k car. But then again, it is all about what you want. Go to the websites and compare the vehicles, go ahead and test drive them all then decide whats best for you.
jo7knixpaa	The blocks are identical but the internals are different, mainly the  pistons - N/A having higher compression - turbo having lower compression.  N/A block doesn't have oil squirters either.  The N/A camshafts have more overlap, where the turbo cams have higher lift and less overlap.

There is a slight possibility you may not be in big trouble depending on the car & length of the remaining payments.  In today's market, it doubtful, but the car's wholesale value may offset the remaining payments (i.e. you have $2000 in remaining payments but car books out for $2000 more than your residual).  Talk with the dealer you leased from.|`|8GDBr2U9aa	What is it people don't understand about contracts? When you sign a lease (which is a contract) for a specific period of time, you are obligating yourself to make ALL the payments as called for in the contract. You can't call "game over" and walk away because you lost your job, got married, had a kid, got divorced, changed your mind, or any of the other reasons people give every day in this forum. You are responsible for paying what is stated in the contract, you can't just walk away from the debt.|`|42700c721dc91bfe46a726d96c9b8b86aa	I'm actually in a similar situation.  I am going to speak to Ford to see what my options are.  I was layed off from my job, found another one six months later but I am no way near making what I was making before and unfortunately I cannot afford to lease my automobile.    Unlike one of the other commenters made, unexpected, life-altering changes DO occur and decisions have to be made to keep or not to keep something.  It's a hard choice to make but oftentimes a choice has to be made and in my case: returning a automobile if there are no other options.      It has nothing to do with 'game over' or not wanting to pay my bills, it's about making sure I have enough money to pay the bills and I can't, something has to go.    Have you spoken to the lender where I got the car?  Talk to them and see what options you have.  Everyone is in the same shoes, not being able to keep up with the bills, it's tough all over.  But you're not alone.    Good Luck and Stay Positive!

dEDDLtl0aa	I bought a 08 SX4 hatchback on Halloween of 2007. I had it for one year and loved the little thing!   Pros: Looks cute, really zips around town for a little 4 cyl. , has decent leg room, and is very good on gas for an AWD. I've never put it in that gear and I live in Pittsburgh (VERY hilly if you don't know) the most I did was downshift into 2nd or 1st. Stereo was very decent too.  Cons: Generally small, little trunk/hatch room, could use an armrest.    I really love this car, but found out for my family (which is neither young or small in stature) that this car was great for me- and me only.  So I just traded it in on a Grand Vitara yesterday..   I'm sure I will have a few regrets (especially at the gas pump)but reality states that I have to fit more than myself in our vehicles! I would say go for it, it is a great, solid little vehicle!!!!!|`|7274403b2b4f83ec6c150a8f7b80a02aaa	4dr or hatchback?   Average gas mileage  Good looks  Reliable  Low maintenance.  Low sticker price.  More standard options then competitors.|`|dT4DXIRGaa	its definitely worth it. and if you buy its better to buy the hatchback it looks nice it comfortable and it consumes little gas and if you decide to buy its better if you buy it with a red colour.
K2QwEM4raa	The insurance should pay as long as you didn't sign anything saying that you would not drive the truck. Yes you will get points. I would pay it, if it is less than a 1,000.00 if I could. Insurance is on the auto not the person.|`|wqeAeSVYaa	This is not an easily answered question because there are a number of missing details regarding your policies.    First, it is important to know that insurance FOLLOWS THE VEHICLE.  That means if Bubba lends you his car, and you get into a wreck, it's BUBBA'S insurance that will be the primary insurance policy on the claim.  If Bubba doesn't carry collision coverage, but your policy DOES, then YOUR insurance policy would be the primary insurance for the collision (first party) damage.      Now, it sounds like when you purchased your respective policies, you told your insurance carrier that you would not drive each other's cars.  Therefore, you need to determine if you are considered an EXCLUDED DRIVER.  If you are an excluded driver for this vehicle, then Bubba's insurance will not cover you.  If you stole Bubba's car, then neither Bubba's nor your own policy would cover you.    You need to talk to your insurance company.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Too confusing, hes got ins and your not on the policy, you have ins and hes not on your policy. you live together, you drove his truck although you know your not suppose to and hit a deer. You both use gieco. You will most likely use yours and pay the deductable. You have made it possibly more confusing than it needed to be. Forget what it will do to your record, pay the deductable and it will get fixed. Hope that it has some value to it, if its a total out you might not get what you both think its worth. His ins should not be affected at all. It should work out fine; You should pay the dedcutable no matter whose policy is going to cover it.|`|dyIyJqauaa	Call and ask Geico.  this is Way too confusing and way too many questions.|`|02023201c466ca1751d4f14fb53cd526aa	The insurance on his truck will pay.  The claim will be paid on his auto insurance policy under collision.    You will get one point on your driving record since there is only property damage and no bodily injury.    But that may depend on your state.    Put in the claim and don't worry about the point.
zlPAVkUBaa	The clicking noise is the solenoid. I believe Fords use an external solenoid. Follow the large red lead from the battery, and it should lead to the solenoid, probably mounted on the sidewall. It should have two large terminals and two small ones. That should be the part making the clicking noise. You can use a large screw driver or a jumper cable to short the two large terminals together. Do this with the key off. There will be sparks, but the starter should turn. If it does, then the solenoid is bad.|`|d8eb2747aa6627fe7a5b835a16139fa6aa	Ok, so you turn the key.  Does it crank, but not start?  If so, it ain't the fuel pump switch.    You said it clicked.  So if it makes a clicking sound, but does not crank, I think it's either the solenoid or the starter motor.|`|AA12041870	What do you mean it hit the curve?  If it's clicking, the alternator isn't the problem, it's the starter that is messed up.|`|UI96F8zaaa	Try resetting your key fob or turn the key in lock to disable anti theft mechanizm,|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	It's the fuel cutoff switch.  Check the owner's manual.  I don't recall if it's in the passenger door panel or trunk on a Fusion.  A red recessed button you push down.|`|NN4RfXwcaa	I think Jerry is right, most cars now a days have a impact fuel shut off. If you dont have a manual on where it is, phone the ford dealer and ask the location of it. Its usually a button or a hole that resets your fuel pump power, if its a hole you poke like a paper clip end in. Its there to automatically shut off your fuel in case of a roll over or like in your case impact. good luck|`|tRXTkzHzaa	Most vehicles come with an auto shut off for the fuel system.  when the car is in an accident it shuts off the fuel supply. Find the switch it is usually just a button.
AGmZNf7zaa	This could be caused by a carbuerator needing adjustment, the timing could be off or one of the cylinders isn't firing at all. Time for a tune up!    lol xx|`|tRXTkzHzaa	It could be 100 things.  You need to have it put on a scope and checked.  If it runs fine there is nothing wrong.  When you rev the car in neutral the cylinders are being loaded with fuel.  When the rpm comes down the exhaust valve causes the excess fuel to burn causing the backfire.  Have you ever had a lawn mower do this? Its the same thing.|`|cmHYbkSJaa	timing...usually but check vacuum lines in carb or efi and carb syn if more than 1 carb an air/fuel mix for time of year and altitude|`|UI96F8zaaa	Check the timing .
AGmZNf7zaa	As an experienced dirt bike rider I would have to say I agree with chuck also.|`|EDOI3Wnzaa	I have a 2005 450exc.  The pipe on your bike was made by FMF and KTM put their name on it. Most pipes and header will only give you 1 to 2 HP more. Most claim up to 5 HP. the key to that statement is UP TO! you can repack the muffler for $30 and get the same performance as buying a new exhaust. Why would you spend 1,500 for exhaust. If you want to go faster  put your money into the suspension. This will make you faster in corners and bumps. You can also ride with people that are faster than you. This will make you a faster rider. go to www.ktmtalk.com.  This is a free website that has tons of postings for your bike.|`|d72a8e15b90497f4f828744386c193a2aa	Excellent answer Chuck... 10 points!! People grossly over-estimate what exhaust will do for them.
AA10346371	Buy something used and inexpensive for a starter bike.    Look for something old but not too old.  You don't want something so old that it is a junker, but not something so new that you'll feel bad if you lay it down.    Look for something in the 500 - 800 CC engine size.  This will be powerful enough so you don't get bored too soon, but not so fast that you will be afraid of it.    Look for a standard or cruiser bike for your first bike.  They are more forgiving.  Stay away from the sport bikes for your first bike as they require more skill.  Going with a sport bike for your first bike is like getting a Formula 1 race car for your first car, not a good idea.  Also used sport bikes tend to be more abused.    Consider the fit of the motorcycle.  People come in all sorts of different shapes and sizes.  So do motorcycles.  When selecting a motorcycle consider how well it fits your body.  Ask yourself how well you can put both feet flat on the ground.  Ask yourself how well the seating position feels.  Do you have to reach too far to the handlebars?  Riding hunched over can get uncomfortable very fast.  Is the foot peg location comfortable?  Does the bike feel too big or too small?  An uncomfortable motorcycle won't be much fun to ride for any amount of distance.  However, a bike that fits you well will be lots of fun.    Avoid buying over the Internet.  I would never buy a motorcycle site unseen.  You could very easily end up paying too much for junk.  Always do a visual inspection and test ride before buying a motorcycle.  When you go to look at the bike, bring a helmet.  If you do not have your motorcycle license yet, bring a friend with a motorcycle license and 2 helmets.    Watch the classified section of your local news paper.  Some locations have shopper magazines with used motorcycles in your area.  Reasonably priced used bikes are out there.  Be patient.  Don't buy too quickly, but if you find one you like, buy it right away.  Unfortunately, as the price of gas rises so will the price of used motorcycles.  If you find a good starter bike, don't hesitate as they can sell quickly.    Don't get hung up on any particular brand.  They are all about the same.  Pay more attention to the bike's condition.  If any one brand were really superior to all other brands, this would be the only brand bike on the road.  In addition, if any brand bike was really inferior to the other brands, nobody would buy them and the company would be out of business.    Learn on this bike.  Make your mistakes on it.  You will make mistakes.  Nearly all new riders will lay their bike on its side at least once.  Would you rather make your mistakes on an older bike or your nice shiny expensive new bike?    The most important thing you should do when getting your first bike is to take a motorcycle safety course.    After you have been riding a while and gain some experience, you can sell your starter bike and get the one you want.  If maintained properly and not abused, you won't lose too much money on your starter bike.  Put the money from the sale towards the bike you really want.  By this time, you will have figured out what style bike best suits your riding style and needs.    If you settle on a sport bike for your next bike, avoid the used ones.  Young riders think they are racers on racing bikes and tend to beat the crap out of them so they are likely to be more abused.  So if considering a sport bike, consider something new.     I know I used this answer before.  However, I feel this is good advice.    Use your head while riding.  Remember, Stupid Hurts.    Have fun - Ride safe|`|d6TZunSXaa	250cc is the minimum you have to have legally to get on the highway. This size will get you up to around 70 mph. I personally have a burgman 650.  This is technically  a scooter and I love it.  very easy to ride so you enjoy the ride and not so much worrying about having to operate it.  its automatic just twist and go and will go  over 100 mph. Thats with me on it and I am 6'2, 330 lbs.  It just all depends on the look you want and what you really want.  If you go the regular bike route  I would stick to a 500 cc to learn on. Buells are really good for that and you can usually get them pretty cheap.|`|R9ao6qzyaa	the make and model is of your preference, but, the most important thing here is,the way the bike feels to you while sitting on it and riding it. most folks purchase them without really checking the feel of the bike !|`|2mkECIheaa	Used 900 Kawasaki Vulcan.   Don't get something too small, or you'll be ready to trade it in 6 weeks....speaking from experience.  250/600cc are too small for a guy your size.   The power is all in your right wrist.|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Whatever you feel comfortable riding. I'm 6'4 240 and have a 96 Honda CBR 600... i'm not uncomfortable at all on it. I wouldn't reccommend anything higher than 600 if your a beginner. This is my first bike also.|`|c22cd3bc80b769e97ac9ae2bc60d368eaa	Being a big guy, perhaps a used cruiser in the 650cc on up class.  I hesitate to suggest a big Harley for a beginner.  Once you're more experienced & confident, you'll have more knowledge of the features you would like to have.|`|tRXTkzHzaa	Most bikes over 125cc  will get you to speed, however, you will not be comfy.  What type of bike do you like?  The more cc's the easier the bike will be to handle and get to speed.  I am a big guy and I have went with over 900 for along time starting with a KZ900 Kow.  I now have a 1200cc Harley and it is comfy and gets up and goes when I need it to.  good luck|`|bqLvWpcZaa	Most bikes 250 cc and up will reach 75 mph.    As far as which bike you should get, that all depends on what type of bike you're looking at ( sport, standard, cruiser,etc ).  The only thing I would recommend is to go to some bike dealers and sit on a few bikes.  See which bike feels the most comfortable to your physique ( not just the handlebars but also the location of the foot pegs, the switches, etc. ).    But before you buy a bike, take a MSF course and buy all your riding gear before you start riding on the road.
XLXncQu9aa	What puzzle?  If you ordered through a service, you can always ask them what the delay is.
kgk3Yz9Naa	things to check before...low oil level,blocked filter,broke hydraulic tappet...  if i recall the oil pump is fitted round the front crankshaft pulley...off with the sump and your there...also check that the pump pickup isn't blocked.they have a Mesh over it that can soon be blocked.|`|mKVFIklaaa	I'd start by changing the oil & filter & refilling with a good quality oil. Don't assume the oil pump's at fault, I think that's unlikely.|`|KRunjrzNaa	i agree with the guy above me but you should make Absolutely sure that it is indeed the oil pump that is not working. It Could also be that there is a leak/crack in one of your heads and oil is being forced down the valve covers into the pistons and you may just be burning up your oil. remove your spark plugs and make sure they don't have any oil on the ends.|`|NN4RfXwcaa	First thing hook up a manual oil pressure gauge to see what your oil pressure is. You might have just a sticky lifter. You can buy some liquid at a good automotive parts store for noisy lifters, sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. Check the pressure first its a big messy job.$$$$ if you get them to fix it.|`|lMIrbwifaa	HI  Yes don't just jump on the change the oil pump wagon... it might just be low on oil. could be a stuck lifter, it could even be an exhaust manifold gasket leak too as they make a sound like a ticking lifter.   Get a second opinion. to change the oil pump they would all most have to pull the motor out, Or at least drop the oil pan.  good luck  tim|`|Og3vKQeWaa	a ticking noise from top end, means an oil pump problem? That different! Don`t even think of changing the oil pump, try draining the oil, running some Wynns or similar, through it first. this will remove any carbon deposits and sludge, then give it a good blast down motorway, should sort it!
