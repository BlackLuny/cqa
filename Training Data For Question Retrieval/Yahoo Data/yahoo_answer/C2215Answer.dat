xJZSpsRhaa	I read up on this from OXM.  The game actually is supposed to take place after a huge earthquake hits a major city.  10magnitude.  There's a shortage of water.  Thats why you see the dude (apparently, just an average joe) throwing the water down.      It looks like a pretty cool game.  Apparently there's going to be tons of tremors which change the games enviroment.      But, no, its not I am Legend. Kinda the same... just no bombs or viral outbreaks.  It's an earthquake with crazy citizens trying to get out.     Hope this helps!|`|m6KLfIi6aa	wrong link  erm it isn't really coz  am legend is about zombies, not floods.  nice graphics though

q6uyloYdaa	I would say at least pick one of the two consoles over upgrading your PC, as PC gaming has been going down while the consoles go up. Between the 360 and PS3, it all depends on what you want. If you want the Blu-ray, pick PS3. If you want a lot of games to choose from, pick 360. If you want to pay for online play but have a lot more players, pick 360. If you want a smaller but free online community, pick PS3.|`|zCUB4u6gaa	The Wii.

But I would suggest playing both systems at a friends or a mall and choose which one YOU think is the most fun.|`|frn6Fcjuaa	i think the ps3 is better because ive played a game on it called Fallout3 and also has a blu ray player. i have a psp and you can go on the internet on there so i think you can go on the internet on ps3. Xbox i don't think it is so good because i have seen someone play it and it doesn't have good graphics. i also think the Xbox is good because if it wasn't then it wouldn't be in a competition with ps3 that my friends argue about every day.

2Qr8vcAfaa	Like the others have said, this is the end of the game. You can go back into the virtual world and do whatever you missed... Collecting flags, pushing around beggars etc.     Aside from this, there's a little more to the "game". You're able to access the conference room (I think that's what it is) and read what's on the laptop in there... That is, if you got the code from one of the other laptops. While this isn't anything exciting, it just helps to explain a few questions you may have, and is put there for the "detail" of the real world.|`|wKXUfedMaa	nope. just ends. its so you can go back to anibus (sp?) to finish every mission you may have missed|`|tL9SuAWbaa	You got to the end, but it puts you back in the room so you can go back and play through the levels again incase you missed anything like the flags and stuff.
FPsMtmThaa	I would say that for Saints Row 3, you won't get the gritty, realistic textures that you see in GTA 4.  I don't believe that is their goal.  It sure wasn't with the first two so no, I wouldn't count on it.  They seem to stick to their own style and not go the same route as other open world games.    Will character customization be even better?  HOw can it?  It's the best I have seen in any game. I find their character customization hilariously funny when you try and go out of your way to make an ugly character.. it's probably one of my favorite parts of the game.  But yea, if they can upgrade that for Saints Row 3, I'd be incredibly impressed.  I won't doubt 'em though.  Good question.  We'll have to wait and see what happens.|`|pl2SocVKaa	it will be a better cartoony look with better customization|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	I doubt it will Come out That Soon If there is one.    I didn't like the graphics in GTA 4  I loved the graphics in Saints row 1 and 2 they were never "Cartoony"|`|wKXUfedMaa	i didnt think that saints row 2 was that cartooney.  it has to be different otherwise its just another gta.|`|2gzfW5TXaa	The graphics will be similar to usual, but a bit better. Customisation I expect to be phenominal, as with the other games. It's gonna be great :D    Oh, and to the previous poster, it most likely will be out by 2010, the Saints Row series comes out pretty fast :)

The sims2 is 39.99 but it's worth it, plus all the expansion packs and stuff packs the game is even better, but when you but the sims 2 try to also buy the sims 2 seasons, it's great then once you have enough money you can buy all expansion packs and stuff packs. They cost 22-29 dollars and stuff packs cost 19.99. also you can sign up at the sims2.com once you have your'e game. And you can download better sims 2 stuff at thesims2.com and  modthesims2.com and thesimsresource.com and like 1000 more sites.|`|EghlsQ5Zaa	The Sims and The Sims 2 are seperate games, so furniture in The Sims won't show up in the Sims 2. The Sims 2 is much better because it's very easy to customize sims, plus there are places to download awesome custom content. The graphics are pretty good too. If you get any of the expansion packs (they're worth it), you need to make sure your driver is good enough though.

JWjq5iaXaa	nope, he'll stay a baby. This is what you CAN do, though.      put in these cheats.    aging on  aspirationlevel 5    (while the wife is selected)  aspirationpoints 32000   (while the wife is still selected)    then, go to the aspiration rewards level, and buy the Elixer of Life. Make her react with it several times. Email me if this dosen't work.|`|Dso7k3sjaa	To answer the first person's question, it's simply aging off or aging on, that's it.    You can actually use a cheat on your sims if you have Nightlife or any of the later released ep's.  It is agesimscheat on/off.  What this cheat does is it makes your sim have a "birthday" that changes them to whatever age you pick -- but puts them at the beginning of that age.  Since they are already adults, you may need to first make them into either a teen or an elder and then use the cheat a second time to turn them back into adults.  But they will now be at the very beginning of the adult life span with 29 more days before they become elders.  Then, you can turn the aging back on so the baby will grow up.  If you leave aging turned off, the baby will not be able to age.    **This cheat may not work unless you turn aging back on first -- before you try to use the cheat.**    Here is a list of all the cheats that came with each game.  But remember, even if you don't have the game the cheat came with originally, if you have any of the later released games the cheat normally still works.  The only exception I am aware of is the Sim Modder cheat that came with Nightlife.  You won't see the Sim Modder if you look at this list, but it is found when you turn the testing cheats on (most people call them the boolprop cheats) and then click on Spawn.  But only if you have Nightlife installed.    Oh, and in the following link, at the top of the page you'll see the word boolprop.  If you click on that, it will explain how to do some of the more "requested" things in the game using the testing cheats.    Here's the link:    http://www.snootysims.com/cheatsindex.ph...    By the way, the rest of that site has a lot of great information about sims 2 and some about sims 3.  You might find it enjoyable to check it out.|`|LMFOUJZhaa	I didn't know you could do that  whats the cheat?|`|eEY8ShQtaa	The baby is going to stay a baby. Everyone in the house will stay the same age. Theirs really no chat that will help you. Theirs a career reward that gives you a cow plant thing and it eats people and then gives you their life's enegy then you become younger. Theirs a cheat to unlock career rewards (unlockcareerrewards). Then theirs also an age thing in regular rewards but it's like alot of points.  Hope this helped!!|`|6pevwBizaa	He's gonna stay a baby - sorry :(     The only way to get him to age would be to turn aging back on (which of course would mean that your wife & you would age as well).|`|4f277076c7dd369d5ac6ab9f14e344f6aa	The kid is going to stay a baby. You turn the aging back on and drink the elixer of life in awards. If you drink that, then you can can get rejuvenated younger and the baby will grow older. Use this wisely b/c it costs in 30,000 aspiration points.
Kddjmy4Aaa	No there are no "Gaia cheats" I'm sorry.  I used to have about 10 Mil on gaia, And it was from Just Posting and Doing alot of work and Knowing how to Buy for cheap in the Marketplace and sell for higher.    one thing to do is:  Buy Jolly hats in summer  Sell Them in Winter.  You usually get a profit of 50k.    Another thing to do is Buy ALOT of Sealed Letters And then sell the items the day They Are Revealed.

AA12283795	City of Heroes. <br>  I've tried Guild Wars for a while and found that I liked the concept of being a Hero (or Villan) more my taste.  The character customization is fantastic, the missions are fun (yet get repetative), and the opportunity to play with a team every time you log on is awesome.  It's the type of game you can play solo or play on a team.  I find that I can go on and pick up a team anytime.  There are always people out there looking to help and asking for advice is never an issue.  the navigation on where your missions are is easy to understand.<br>  <br>  City of Heroes is mainly centered around missions yes, however if you prefer PvP there is plenty of opportunity to play that way as well.  There are many zones and the game is always improving.<br>  <br>  side note: I quit playing CoH for a while and had to come back to it. Can't give it up!

fb4ff219ccd244d55f1da5511c8ed769aa	OO Man i also have a PSP i bought 1 sandisk 1GB memory stick woiht the adapter. 1gb is supposed to be 124 mb! HLDS LIKE 300 SONGS AND CRAP! But it only holds about 949 Mb cuz of the stick size. But it cheap for like 50-70 bucks.|`|20f1c5f6187738c02c156597e24c0c5aaa	Whatever you can afford really, a good sized memory stick will obviously allow you to do more things, like downloading movies etc....|`|37bf92e2db71edeecb017b54fb3d4ea8aa	you should get the 2GB 1. cuz u can save alot of stuff in that.....|`|41103ecb4703bb90658c9cc0dad77aabaa	The bigger the better especially if you have FW 1.5. If you have 2.5 or 2.6 you can downgrade now to play homebrew which makes the psp worth it.|`|586042385de550234a829d80488ea39aaa	the bigger the better man, the PSP is not only intended for games but is intended to hold movies, music, photos, and so on, it can also browse the internet so its like computer RAM man. so buy a big memory card but not one that leaves tumble weeds in your walllet like if you got 50 bucks, and a nice one costs 50 bucks, and that 50 bucks is all you got for the week, try and get one that costs 20 or 30 bucks, because the gaming side of the PSP hasent been going too well, as some of us can tell by that one comercial with the finger pupets acting out romeo and juliet.|`|9bebae3281d76d9f95eda17363cbb50daa	it depends on your usage of the psp...if you have it strictly for games ...then a 512 mb would do ...but if you use it for movies and for playing music...then you need to get somethin bigger....personally if you have the money go for the highest capacity....4 gb memorystick by sandisk ...or 2 gb by sony memorystick pro duo...
0d9dd0fecb063c845579f69eb5e817bfaa	They are very different:<br>  <br>  World of Warcraft is a very traditional online RPG.  It's a huge, sprawling and interesting world, with lots of places to explore -- and you determine what you do and when (even though there are some quests to help you go in the right direction.)  It's mostly "PVE" -- Player vs. Environment -- which means you spend most of your time fighting monsters and exploring dungeons and things (although there are opportunities for PvP as well.)<br>  <br>  On the downside, it's got the "grind" problem:  it's all about getting levels and getting the best gear.  This means a LOT of repetitive killing of monsters in order to get gold or rare drops, etc.<br>  <br>  Basically it's a very, very good "Everquest" or "Ultima Online" -- if you've played either of those games (or any others like them) WoW will be very familiar.  It charges you for the initial software and about $15 a month to play.  It also charges for expansions (the first one is due out soon.)<br>  <br>  Guild Wars looks similar on the surface, but it's not.  Famously you do NOT pay a monthly fee; instead they sell new "episodes" every 6mo. or so -- each one is a standalone game and costs about $50.<br>  <br>  But more importantly, Guild Wars is much more focused on "PvP" -- Player vs. Player combat.  <br>  <br>  There is an excellent series of quests for PvE play (a very strongly definied storyline, that takes you literally from one end of the game to the other -- and gets you to the max level, 20, along the way.)  BUT -- in Guild Wars you can just skip all that and create a PvP character at the max level, and start PvPing the very first day.<br>  <br>  The combat system is very different, too -- much much faster than WoW, with a large and intricate set of skills for each character (comparison:  WoW you get probably 25 skills/spells; GW you get 120.)  But before you fight, you have to pick only 8 of them (kind of like building a deck in Magic: the Gathering, etc.)  It means you need to think about tactics and strategies.<br>  <br>  Also, as you guess from the title, Guids are really, really important, and a big part of the game.  Large Guild vs. Guild battles are in many ways the heart of the game.<br>  <br>  On the downside, GW is pretty "thin" content-wise.  The world is beautiful, but there's nowhere near as much to do and explore as with WoW.<br>  <br>  Bottom line:<br>  <br>  WoW: PvE, traditional leveling and exploration, concentrate on building one main character, lots of social opportunity, monthly fee<br>  <br>  GW: PvP, no grind, build lots of different characters as you try out different stuff, very stripped down world, no monthly fee|`|AA10137766	They are both good for different reasons, but I will have to say World of Warcraft.<br>  <br>  Guild wars is good if you don't want to buy a 2 month game card for $30<br>  <br>  but it's worth it
fBtmvkfgaa	just keep on trying till u get it or search on google<br>  <br>  -_-|`|ds6Z3VbEaa	Hah, I had a real hard time with this one.<br>  <br>  Basically, it's a very tough mission with a very sharp timer, so you need to make sure you take down the cars as fast as you can and as many as you can without crashing or slowing down at all.<br>  <br>  In order to complete this, you need to be going at full speed the entire time which means you have to have an almost perfect combination of driving and destroying. You should make it with literally maybe 1 or 2 seconds to spare. Tough but possible!

The new expansion packs just add parts and more animations.<br>  <br>  For example, hunger, pregnancy, woohoo and actions like that, all the sims TV programs, the sims music and base areas of the game like the behavior of stoves, sofas and fridges... all that info is on the base game.<br>  <br>  So it's not 'dumb'. It just that if they put all that stuff with every expansion, you'd have to pay a lot more for each game update because it would need to have all that stuff put into the game again. *grin* This way it's cheaper. You can just buy the parts you want AFTER you have already installed the base game.<br>  <br>  BTW, the game information for expansion packs does say that "The Sims 2" is required. (It didn't mention anything about reading ability tho. heehee)<br>  <br>  When I first got the Sims (sims 1), I didn't know what an expansion pack was either so the side panel didn't make much sense to me either!|`|6a3d0b8b7446f1d5701609b341c611b8aa	yeah if u just have Sims 2 university and not The Sims 2. then u gotta get The Sims 2 to play the Sims 2 university. The Sims 2 university is the Expansion pack.

You need to be ready for absolutely anything from it.<br>  <br>  Mew is a pyschic pokémon, giving it weaknesses to Dark, Ghost and Bug.  Remember that Mew could have a move to hit those types, so any tactic is risky.<br>  <br>  If I was to suggest a pokémon, it would be a Houndoom.  Be sure to give it Will-o-wisp though (Breed a male vulpix/ninetails with will-o-wisp with a female  houndour/houndoom to get a houndour with will-o-wisp).  The first thing you should do is use will-o-wisp to burn Mew.  That way, the attack power will be cut and give houndoom a fighting chance should Mew have brick break. Focus punch or earthquake.  From that point on, repeititive use of Crunch should see Mew to the floor.|`|3fcb61ec046a801cac527d27dcabdf1eaa	a level 100 absol with maxed out stats, using a dark type move( bite works well). throw some black glasses on that bad boy for good mesure.|`|49a464baccbd090fbc49f752b367253faa	any lvl 100 pokemon with the attack LEECH LIFE. for some reason, it's super effective.|`|cOr12AGBaa	Milotic|`|CcYFIMygaa	a good pokemon would be a lvl100 gengar, due to its ghost type, being super effective on mew's psychic type.<br>  try putting it to sleep with hypnosis and then use nightmare...it should be an effective way, or you can just attack it head on with a strong ghost type attack such as shadow ball.

c43d322f9f23aa02000df7041a715b96aa	you mean kindom hearts...preferably i prefer the first one and chain of memories but here is what you looking for...(well its the complete story anyway)<br>  <br>   Kingdom Hearts... <br>   Sora, Riku, and Kairi lived on Destiny Islands. They all dreamed of seeing other worlds, and felt isolated on their tiny islands. Sora has been having weird visions of a door and other mysterious things that he doesn't get at the time. Sora and his friends built a raft to leave, but the process was disrupted…one night a huge monster known as a heartless, let in by Riku who had opened the door to darkness [from Sora's visions], came to the island and destroyed it…sending Sora and Riku different places as they escaped before it was destroyed…but it is was not known where Kairi or any of the other residents of Destiny Islands are…<br>  Sora begins a journey across worlds to find Riku and Kairi, and on the way he is entangled in a great quest (the one the thoughts and dreams were about) having a great deal to do with the keyblade that he was chosen to recieve. He meets up with Riku very soon, but he is acting very strange. Sora invites Riku along with Donald and Goofy, the friends he met in Traverse Town, to find not only Kairi but Mickey, the king. Riku just disappears. Later Sora finds out that Riku has turned to the side of the heartless and is under Maleficent’s control, and she had convinced Riku that Sora has simply forgotten him while travelling with Donald and Goofy. Long story short with some plot points left out, he travels to Hollow Bastion to find Kairi and end this business. What he finds there is not only Riku and Maleficent, but the seven princesses of heart that are needed to open the final keyhole. After battling Riku, who is now possessed by Ansem, the Seeker of Darkness, Sora finds that Kairi’s heart was inside him and he uses the dark keyblade of Riku’s to unlock his own heart and free Kairi, who is the last Princess of Heart and her heart joins with the others to open the keyhole. Sora seals the keyhole to Hollow Bastion and they are off again, to the End of the World...where they will find Ansem.<br>  Sora eventually finds a sort of artificial version of Destiny Islands through the door to darkness from his visions, where he finds Ansem. Ansem tries to convince Sora that darkness will prevail in the end and some other stuff, and shows him the Endless Abyss and the door to Kingdom Hearts - the heart of the darkness. After a long series of battles, Sora conquers. Sora, along with Mickey, shut the door to Kingdom Hearts, for Ansem had opened it. Sora is separated from Kairi and she is sent back to Destiny Islands once it is restored to await him. The next time we see Sora, Donald, and Goofy, they are on a long empty road chasing Pluto, who has a letter from King Mickey.<br>  <br>  Sora... <br>    Sora and company chase the dog for what seems like forever until he comes to a crossroads. He there meets an unknown person in a black hooded cloak. He has a short conversation with this mysterious guy, who says "Ahead lies something you seek, but to find it you must lose something dear" and ends up walking down to a place known as Castle Oblivion. Here Sora begins to lose his memories piece by piece as they are replaced by others while he progresses up the floors searching for Riku and King Mickey because “somehow he knows they are there”. In truth this is only the Organization that inhabit the castle having Namine, a girl that will definitely remind you of Kairi, mess with Sora’s thoughts and feelings. She is the one that made Castle Oblivion appear before him. <br>  Sora proceeds floor after floor and still losing more memories. He finds his way to the top after finding the truth about Namine, who had went so far on Marluxia’s orders as to disrupt Sora’s memories that she now had replaced Kairi with Namine in every aspect of his mind. Sora defeats here Larxene, Axel, and Marluxia, freeing Namine’s hold on his mind. Namine puts him in a sort of “hibernation” that will make him forget everything that happened in the castle, but gain his original memories back. Sora and Namine (he knows who she is now - Kairi's shell) make a promise to meet again someday.<br>  <br>  Riku...<br>  Riku finds himself well, sleeping, a world that is neither light nor darkness. He hears a strange voice, a voice that soon becomes Ansem’s voice. Ansem talks to Riku telling him many things…even to let him come back into his heart. Riku refuses and wakes. He is on the same road as Sora was on. He spots Castle Oblivion as well, because of his connection with Sora. He goes in, but starts working towards the ground floor from the bottom basement, him too working floor after floor defeating the figures of darkness from his memories to get to what he is searching for.<br>  Vexen, an Organization member, makes a fake Riku that challenges not only Riku, but Sora as well, all over Namine. Because of this, Sora believes Riku to be turned back to darkness nearly the whole game. Riku progresses downward in the castle, and defeats, like Sora, many of the Organization members. Long story short, he eventually finds himself face to face with Ansem, and conquers.<br>  He meets Namine, and sees Sora in his “hibernation”. The next we see of Riku, he is walking with King Mickey down that same long road in a long black hooded cloaks talking to an Organization member, DiZ, who has helped Riku and was actually the voice that he heard at the beginning of the game, not Ansem. <br>   <br>  KH2<br>   The game starts with a beautiful FMV cutscene that recaps the events of Kingdom Hearts and Chain of Memories. After this, the screen switches to Twilight Town and you are then introduced to Roxas, the character you will be playing as for the next 4-5 hours. What starts as a regular summer vacation for the 4 Twilight town kids [Roxas, Hayner, Pence, and Olette] little by little becomes more and more awkward because of strange visitors to the town [the Nobodies] and strange hooded characters, that for some reason only Roxas can see. Roxas solves much of this mystery, but I won't go any further cause I'd hate to ruin the game for you.<br>  ^_^<br>  <br>  Secret Ansem Reports...<br>  <br>  Many years of hard work has come to fruition; this world that I govern has <br>  become a paradise, aptly named the "Radiant Garden".<br>  Flowers bloom with a fragrant aroma, raised by the pure water which brings forth<br>  life. The people pass their days with smiling faces full of hope.<br>  <br>  But wherever there is light, doubtless there is darkness lurking. As I have <br>  written in my recent report, I must decipher the mystery behind "the darkness in<br>  human hearts" to protect this paradise.<br>  <br>  Firstly, I will carry out experiments to seek out the depths of the human heart.<br>  One of my six disciples, Xehanort, has volunteered himself as a test subject.<br>  Since I found him collapsed in the street all those years ago and took him in, <br>  he has become a youth who serves me well.<br>  <br>  At that time, he had lost his memories entirely, but afterwards he began to <br>  exhibit a remarkable inquisitive mind. He absorbed my teachings incredibly <br>  quickly, and amassed a deep knowledge.<br>  He is somewhat undeveloped in maturity, but this problem is due to his youth.<br>  <br>  If I can seek Xehanort's heart through psychological experiments, I may also be <br>  able to unlock his sealed-off past.<br>  It seems that another of my disciples, Even, also has a strong interest in <br>  Xehanort's memories.<br>  <br>  But I wonder whether it is truly good that is in him.<br>  Certainly, Xehanort possesses great talent...<br>  <br>  Maybe too great, perhaps it is even superhuman. <br>  <br>  I have made a grave error.<br>  <br>  The research plans I made about the "darkness in the heart", beginning with <br>  meager psychological experiments, have grown immensely.<br>  Spurred on by my youngest disciple Ienzo, I have prepared a <br>  grand-scale research laboratory below the castle.<br>  <br>  Unbeknownst to me, my six disciples gathered a great amount of test subjects and<br>  began dangerous experiments into the darkness of the heart.<br>  <br>  As soon as I found out about this, I gathered my disciples and ordered a stop to<br>  the research, and to discard the results thus far.<br>  <br>  What has happened to the hearts of the six who were once my loyal disciples?<br>  While pursuing the mystery of the darkness in the heart, did they themselves <br>  lose their way in the darkness? And the most foolish thing is that it was I who <br>  originally began these experiments.<br>  Whatever the reason, the depths of the human heart should not be meddled in by <br>  others.<br>  I despaired in my own error.<br>  <br>  It was a visitor from another world who cured my grief-stricken heart.<br>  A tiny king named "Mickey" carried the legendary key in his hand.<br>  Yes, it was the "Keyblade" which was said to have brought chaos and prosperity <br>  to the world a long time ago.<br>  He had a great amount of interesting knowledge, and we had enjoyable lengthy <br>  discussions, growing closer.<br>  <br>  On his advice, I decided to re-examine the data from the underground laboratory.<br>  <br>  And I discovered the "Ansem Reports".<br>  <br>  Though they carried my name, the only one that I had written was Number 0.<br>  Apparently he went on to pen numbers 1 through 8 himself.<br>  <br>  Yes, the first subject in my foolish experiments. <br>  <br>  (AS YOU KNOW THERE ARE 13 REPORTS!...so im not going to put them all but here is what i think the important one's are<br>  <br>  Sora will awaken tomorrow.<br>  The end of my long-awaited revenge will begin.<br>  <br>  Xehanort, who took everything away from me.<br>  Deatroyed as a Heartless, his ambitions are once again aimed at the "great <br>  heart", Kingdom Hearts.<br>  <br>  His Heartless's ambition was to collect the hearts of the worlds and bring them <br>  together to Kingdom Hearts, to call forth a great darkness. But his Nobody is <br>  now collecting human hearts to absorb into Kingdom Hearts.<br>  <br>  My foolish disciple.<br>  <br>  One mystery remains.<br>  How did Xehanort open the door that appeared below my castle...?<br>  <br>  No...all theories are pointless now, when all things are coming to an end.<br>  <br>  Roxas, Ansem, Namine.<br>  You should not have existed in theory, and yet you are truly there. Special <br>  exceptions.<br>  <br>  The theories that I and Organization XIII have put together have been exceeded by <br>  the owners of strong hearts.<br>  <br>  Sora, Kairi, Riku.<br>  <br>  Yes, Riku.<br>  There was weakness in his heart that was exploited by the darkness, but he <br>  defeated it with the hope that he discovered at the extremities of his <br>  suffering, and even retained the darkness of the heart of his enemy as his own <br>  power.<br>  I wish from the bottom of my heart that when all of this ends, he will return to<br>  that island with Sora.<br>  <br>  If I can, I would also like to return to the "Radiant Garden", and once more see<br>  the beautiful water and flowers, and the smiling faces overflowing with hope.<br>  <br>  King, my friend.<br>  I trust that you will see these true records that I have written.<br>  <br>  I wanted to chat with you again.<br>  Please forgive me.|`|b1977fb6f4453aebffc869b0612bc362aa	I thought Riku turned to darkness in the kh1 because he was jealous of sora, influenced by Maleficent and then became possessed by Ansem, then stayed in darkness to help Sora out by guiding him in kh2<br>  <br>  Kari gave her heart to sora when her body was taken from the island which means she couldn't fill the seven hearts of princesses for Maleficent.  To wake her sora had to release her heart from his body.<br>  <br>  I don't' think so, but I am not sure about Sora becoming a Heartless in kh2.<br>  <br>  Namine was to Kari what Roxas was to Sora, an alternate projection of themselves.  Both appeared while both Sora and Kari had gotten there hearts back at the end of kh1<br>  <br>  Play kh1, then kh Chain of memories for the gameboy, (explain where namine comes form),  then kh2 through a 2sd time and you will pick up thing you might not have before.  FF7 was that way for me I had to play it 3x before I understood what was going on.

fvre0o9laa	Let me give you some examples of what happens when clothes are cut offgrain, and why it's important:  Have you ever had a pair of jeans that wanted to twist around your legs when you walked?  If so, you had a pair of jeans where the threads in the fabric didn't go straight up and down the center of the front and back of the legs.  They were cut "offgrain" and it's a mark of poor workmanship (and usually cheap jeans, though not always!)<br>  <br>  Have you ever had a t-shirt that wanted to have one side seam pull around to the front while the other headed for your back?  That t-shirt was cut offgrain.  <br>  <br>  Have you ever tried to fold a piece of fabric -- a scarf, a pillowcase, and when you tried to smooth in the foldline, there were diagonal wrinkles and it didn't want to lie down?  The fold in your fabric was offgrain.<br>  <br>  Grainlines control how the fabric hangs -- whether it's on your body or as curtains.  When the lengthwise grain is perpendicular to the floor,<br>  the fabric will hang evenly.  When it's not perpendicular, the fabric will hang funny, and usually have funny ripples at the hemline.<br>  <br>  When you're laying out a pattern for cutting, it's very important to have the grainline arrows arranged exactly on the lengthwise grain of the fabric so the garment will hang correctly.  To do that, you'll measure over to the top and bottom of the grainline arrows from the selvage (the finished edge of the fabric).<br>  <br>  Because it's easier to show you than to try to put this in words, I'm going to take a few pictures of some fabric samples and show you how to find both the lengthwise grainline and the crossgrain on both wovens and knits.   <br>  <br>  I've made you three tutorial albums... <br>  <a href="http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/view/20946606" rel="nofollow">http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/vi...</a> covers the grainline of wovens -- I have three sample fabrics up, with grainlines marked by thread basting.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/view/20946722" rel="nofollow">http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/vi...</a> is a sample of interlock knit -- knits technically don't have grainlines, but they do have wales and courses, which act much like grainlines and are generally called lengthwise and crossgrain.  Again, basting marks the lengthwise grain and crossgrain.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/view/20946740" rel="nofollow">http://www.picturetrail.com/sfx/album/vi...</a> covers preparing a pattern piece to be laid out properly on fabric for cutting, matching the grainline of the pattern piece to the grainline of the fabric.<br>  <br>  Fabric almost always shrinks more along the lengthwise grain than the crossgrain.  Buy three yards of accurately measured fabric, throw it in the washer and dryer and you'll probably measure it at 2 yards some inches.  But the width of the fabric probably won't have shrunk nearly as much... maybe 60" down to 59".  This is why jeans hems are farther from the floor after you've washed your jeans a couple of times, but they still fit around.|`|Q904TpBzaa	Take your material in your hands and stretch it and if the material does not stretch that is the straight grain and you lay your pattern according to directions.If you go against the grain your material will stretch and the article will not fit correctly.Hope this helps you.|`|3GzFSIN3aa	When you look at fabric, stretch it a little tight to get a good look at how it is woven together.  The "grain" is the way the fabric is woven together.  The grain affects which direction the fabric will stretch.  Take a small piece of your fabric and pull it from opposite corners.  Pull it from opposite sides, turn and pull from the other sides.  The grain is going in the direction that stretches most.  When laying a pattern you need to know where you want the fabric to be more stretchy (a skirt waist) or less stretchy (pant length).  |`|JiF5ndGUaa	Look at graphing paper.  The lines represent grain (thread).  If your paper is 11" x8", the long edges represent the salvages...where the fabric has not been cut....this long direction all across the paper is usually called the grain.  The short direction, from side to side is the cross grain.  Corner to corner is the bias....this is where you will get the most stretch which is good for making 'bias' tape.  Hope this helps.|`|4bfb0de91c3d43a0ead3718c7d3f8ee9aa	go to taunton.com/threads and then in their search type: go against the grain for a good explanation, it also has a picture
0d9dd0fecb063c845579f69eb5e817bfaa	The best thing to do is quests!<br>  <br>  Guild Wars has a set of "storyline" quests which will literally take you from one end of the game to the other.  Each quest requires you to kill monsters (which gives you XP) and has an XP reward at the end (along with gold or items or whatever.)<br>  <br>  This is also the most interesting way to do it.  You'll be level 20 before you know it (and way before you finish the story.)<br>  <br>  The storyline quests can by confusing, because they are a mix of quests and missions.  To find the storyline quests:<br>  <br>  1. Look on your quests list ("L") and do any quests in the "Primary Quests" section<br>  2. Look at your game map ("M") and travel to any cities with a flashing icon.  These are missions that you have to do to continue the storyline.<br>  3. Take every quest you see.  This is only occasionally a problem (because if you take a few quests, that will spawn more monsters in the areas you visit.)  But for the most part you want to take them all, so you are always sure to have the Primary Quests.<br>  <br>  You'll also find that most of the players are doing this, so finding a group is a lot easier than just finding a group to go kill monsters.<br>  <br>  And even if you can't do the primary quests yet (in Nightfall, you have to be of a certain level to do some of them) then do other quests.  It's the fastest way to XP.|`|fa321b630c900bc2653261c7c6328b10aa	Um..you kill monsters to level up. Using your skills you obtained. Or you can do some quests.

I have a family go in first, and eat everything from the fridge, so that all the pre-added food gets used up. then I kill them (cruel, I know) so that everything on the lot is left 'as is.'<br>  then when the next family moves in, they have to eat only their vegetables or fish, and drink their juices.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  happy simming!|`|e5bc9ce7ce1e24e9d830c7f9de3714bfaa	i love the snow and the pool items and almost everything|`|yv3BEZEWaa	I really enjoyed this expansion pack.

K1dqsTKoaa	I agree with Band Geek. There's no point in disiplining the children. They never do anything bad unless you make them. Also, if "free will" is turned off, then they definately won't do anything bad because you control them totally.<br>  <br>  But, I think that University is better because it's a new generation of sims and you can build dorms etc. Whereas with Pets, I was quite disappointed because you can't even control the pets and I don't think there's many options as to what you can do with them.<br>  <br>  :]|`|e5bc9ce7ce1e24e9d830c7f9de3714bfaa	k  u can not discipline the children cause they don't do bad stuff but u can encourage them to do like to be playfully and to be out going and teenagers can sneak out and the parents can catch them and give them a lecture and i have all the expansion packs and if u are a animal lover get pets and i think university is better and for me the best expansion pack is Sims 2 Bon Voyage|`|3ca01557de6bc5e62bf443b9eab06cfcaa	1. you can't discipline the children because they don't do anything bad.  the only thing is when the teens sneak out and get caught the parents will automatically lecture them.<br>  <br>  2. pets.

0d9dd0fecb063c845579f69eb5e817bfaa	Basically there are three types of armor for each profession:<br>  <br>  - Standard armor:  There are several standard armor designs for each profession.  You mostly get it from crafters, but some collectors also give this armor as rewards for turning in stuff.  Standard armor ranges from the very lowest protection, up to max protection for your profession.<br>  <br>  - Ascended armor:  This is *always* maximum protection.  This armor is always created by crafters, and usually requires rare crafting materials to make.  It's also really expensive -- in fact, it's called "15K armor" because that's how much gold you pay per piece for many types of Ascended armor.  This armor LOOKS great -- but it offers no more protection than standard armor with the top armor value.  There are several types of Ascended Armor for each profession.<br>  <br>  - Obsidian armor.  Each profession also has a single set of "Obsidian Armor" which you can only get from a zone called the "Fissure of Woe."  This is hard to get to, hard to unlock, and the armor is crazy expensive (because it costs 15K, but also has very very rare components: ectoplasms and obsidian shards.)  Again, this stuff LOOKS GREAT -- but doesn't offer any more protection than the standard stuff with the max armor rating.<br>  <br>  There are no "armor drops" in Guild Wars -- it's all purchased from crafters.<br>  <br>  Get details on all sets, what you need to craft them, and who will craft them, here:<br>  <a href="http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Armor_types" rel="nofollow">http://gw.gamewikis.org/wiki/Armor_types</a>|`|d2c57ee2dfc8ea3863ef065ed498f6c6aa	dude go out and buy world of warcraft now...|`|FoMNKNt4aa	Guild Wars FactionsTM is the highly anticipated follow-up to Guild Wars?, the critically acclaimed online roleplaying game that revolutionized online gaming with its fresh design, innovative technology and no-subscription-fee pricing.

I like my Assassin/Ranger combo, great attacks, and the ranger abilities give him the extra boost that he needs in attacks. If you don't have Factions, I would recommend a Warrior primary, maybe with a Monk secondary for healing purposes. But like I said, it all depends on your play style.|`|0d9dd0fecb063c845579f69eb5e817bfaa	Are you looking for a recommendation of what you should start out as, so you aren't wasting your time working through a roleplaying character?<br>  <br>  The following builds are almost always in demand by groups, both in PVE and PVP:<br>  <br>  Healer: Monk primary, usually Mesmer secondary<br>  Tank: Warrior primary, usually Monk secondary<br>  Nuker: Elementalist primary, Mesmer or Monk secondary<br>  <br>  If you want to always be able to get a group, then Healer is the way to go -- everybody wants them, and there aren't enough.<br>  <br>  There are a few pairings which seem to support a whole bunch of roles.  These are also good choices, because it means you can do different stuff if you need to, or feel like it:<br>  <br>  Necro/Mesmer (roles: Energy Battery, Spiteful Spirit nuker, Degen, Minion Master)<br>  Monk/Mesmer (roles: Healer, Bonder, Smiter)<br>  Ranger/Monk (roles: Barrager, interrupter, spiker)<br>  <br>  Really, there isn't a "best."  Keep the following in mind:<br>  <br>  - Have fun!  You should experiment (through the PVP characters) and figure out what you like to do best.<br>  - The need changes a LOT from situation to situation (PvE, challenge missions, GvG, farming, running, etc.) so try to be flexible.<br>  - Learn from the work other players have put in.  I put a couple of links below to build directories and an interesting discussion on builds.<br>  - Discover new stuff!  There are lots of combos that haven't been discovered yet.  And some builds (like the infamous "IWAY" build) have actually fallen out of favor either because of changes in the game, or people discovering better things.

Here's why:<br>  <br>  Guild Wars works differently from most games like this.  Each "Episode" takes place on a different continent of the game world; Prophecies takes place on Tyria, Factions takes place on Cantha.<br>  <br>  If you own just Factions, then you can do everything on Cantha; if you own just Prophecies, you can do everything on Tyria.<br>  <br>  If you own both, you can do everything in both places, and travel back and forth between the two.<br>  <br>  Oh, and there's one more continent, which everyone can get to:  It's the Isles of the Nameless, where people from both continents can fight each other in PvP combat.<br>  <br>  So, you can start with either, and if you like it, get the other one.|`|191bb1756bf7988e620e25a0ad0e54f7aa	most likely, you buy the original game and load it to your computer.  once it is loaded and you sign onto the game, it will update the remainder for you.

It could be a little offensive towards other people.  You could always play it with a few of your (guy ) friends and all have fun,  but it really has no point to it.  I wouldn't recommend this game to anyone who isn't mature enough to play.  (Little Kids)  It does have nudity in it.  But it takes awhile for anything to really show up.  You have to answer numerous answers right and move to other levels answering more questions....ect..  It is just a question game and that is all.  Nothing to kill blow-up or find.  I would rate this game on a scale (1-10) about  3.5.  I hope this will help you decide if you would want to buy this game.  I wouldn't pay more than $10 for it.

(Just west of Lumbridge)  He will tell you about the ghosts and give you some white cans and other various cans along with a sprayer. Go north and a little east to find a house that has a trapdoor. Go down it and you will see toys walking around. Put one of the white cans with the sprayer, use it on the toy and it will become a gheist of a certain color. Use whichever can matches it with the sprayer and spray the gheist. To get all the rewards you need to spray 3 of each color. Also, in the same area, go down the ladder with a hatchet. There will be a giant tree. Try to pull the root and you will end up inside, cut 10 evil roots and take them back to Diango.

Most craft festivals and church bazaars do not require them and it will be noted on their entry form if it is needed. Many flea markets now require them but allow you to buy a permit for the weekend for $2 - $5. <br>  <br>  I do most of my selling in consignment shops so they collect the sales tax and pay it so I am not required to have one. I do a couple of shows each year and one flea market near the end of the year to do clearance sales on the leftovers. My show sales are below the state minimum for crafters so I just buy the $5 city license when I do the flea market.<br>  <br>  Your best investment is to join the local arts & crafts guild.

Call the garden club over by clicking on the phone, select service, then garden club. After they get there, greet them, then click on them and select request garden club membership. You have to get between 700 and 1000 for a score to get the wishing well. To help improve your score, make sure as many of your plants and orchard trees as possible are thriving. Having the ground fertilized will give you more points. All landscaping on the lot can add or subtract from your score, including leaves laying on the ground and holes a dog may have dug.

Your sim has to earn talent badges in styling to be able to change another sim's appearance. Otherwise, they'll give either good makeovers but not change anything in the appearance, or bad makeovers that will make the other sim cry. :P <br>  <br>  Tip: If you charge for the makeover (say, you have a beauty salon) and your sim has no talent badges, you'll get a bad makeover.

e5bc9ce7ce1e24e9d830c7f9de3714bfaa	ok well it happen to me too and i have a new computer and i built a house with like 90 rooms and tons off little stuff in it and i could barely work and then i unstalled my games and installed them back and them i bought a normal house and i realized my game was really slow cause of the house and too many stuff in it|`|vmv1rP76aa	it's probably your pc, that happens to me too and most often it's because i have an older pc, most likely graphics card and processor issues might be slowing you down. You may want to upgrade your system.|`|1og67QPkaa	i don't think you can do anything about it beacuse it happens to me
tvEgFQ6haa	I have WoW and all Guild Wars, WOW sucks because its all about grind grind and grind. Get Nightfall because thats where everyone is, its newer, it has more content, heroes that come with you, not henchmen, customizable heroes. It closes loose ends from prophecies and factions, better armor, more fun. ETC. Much more missions, content, and such.|`|9e86399d969ee074fdddb1ec9e65bfc1aa	it depends on what kind of scenery and background you want.  Factions has an asian themed background with an assassin class and a ritualist class.   Nightfall has a middle eastern theme with  dervish and paragon classes.  most people who play guild wars will get both expansions, but if you only want or can afford one, choose which expansion you would enjoy playing more.  do some research before you buy and you'll save yourself a lot of headache.|`|m3N9pNCxaa	guild wars sucks<br>  <br>  World of Warcraft is the best MMO<br>  <br>  or u can just get a life, its what i did after i played WoW for years... hehe|`|ThVbsFkgaa	Guild wars is really a huge game, you must pay much time on it, and at the sametime you should pay for it.<br>  if you want to find some of these website ,there are some. hope it is useful.<br>  <br>  <br>  http://guildwars,igsky,com/<br>  <br>  http://www,igsky,com/|`|nHP1B51Eaa	Between the two, I like nightfall cause you can have hero's.|`|nMQekmSLaa	if you want easy, get factions. if you want content get nightfall|`|nZjqpQqXaa	That depends entirely on your taste.<br>  I have Factions because you get:<br>  Assassins. (They have very fancy moves, like diving, twirling, spinning and jumping.)<br>  Ritualist. (They summon spirits to do various things for them. For example, increase their defense, simply increase party members, attack or defend.)<br>  <br>  Nightfall has:<br>  Dervish (Just like playing a Paladin on any other game.)<br>  Paragon (Like playing a World of Warcraft Warrior as a buffing player. They use shouts and commands to increase the stats of their allies and strengthen them.)<br>  <br>  Factions brings you up in Cantha, in the Shing Jea Monastery, including every vendor in-game.<br>  <br>  Nightfall brings you up in Istan, and like Factions' Henchmen which assist you in battles, you may select heroes in Nightfall, which are exactly like Henchmen, but you may equip them with gear of your desire.<br>  <br>  Personally, I would buy both, as I like assassin style-play and Dervish style-play, but it's up to you and your likes.

oDsQbdmBaa	There's the sims of course, which you have to instal before any of the expansion packs. If you want, you can get the deluxe, or DVD edition, but the regular one works just fine.<br>  From personal buying, I think they can run anywhere from $20-$50 dollars. I would recommend only getting a few,  pets being one of them, and perhaps a stuff pack, but be forwarned that they take up alot of memory. Have fun gaming!<br>  <br>  Expansion Packs: <br>   <br>  The Sims 2 H&M? Fashion Stuff Pack<br>  Your Sims can choose from contemporary fashion essentials including flirty short dresses, casual but striking dress shirts, and other head-turning outfits, complete with accessories-all inspired by real H&M? designs.<br>   <br>  The Sims 2 Celebration Stuff Pack<br>  Your Sims can now celebrate in style with this fun collection of furniture, party fashions, and décor items. Host the social events of the season with your Sims!<br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Glamour Life Stuff Pack<br>  Your Sims can now indulge in a glamorous life with this collection of luxurious furniture, fashionable clothing, and extravagant décor items.<br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Family Fun Stuff Pack<br>  Let your Sims' family have fun with this all-new collection of nautical and fantasy furniture, clothing, and décor.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Bon Voyage (not out yet, but coming soon)<br>  Whisk your Sims away from their everyday routines and take them on exciting trips to three exotic locations!<br>  <br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Seasons<br>  Head outdoors for year-round fun with your Sims!<br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Pets<br>  Create the perfect pet for your Sims to train, play with, and love throughout a lifetime.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Open For Business<br>  Now your Sims can create their own businesses.<br>  <br>  The Sims 2 Nightlife<br>  Take your Sims out on the town for an unforgettable night.<br>  <br>  <br>  The Sims 2 University<br>  Immerse your Sims in college life. Become the Big Sim on campus!|`|dxaerySraa	ummmmm|`|eW4L7nwHaa	At best buy you can buy the sims2 deluxe which comes with the sims 2 and the nightlife pack for $40.  I like all of the other expansion packs better though.  I like open for buisness, seasons and pets better than nightlife but each of them sells for $30.  When I bought the sims2 by its self i think i paid $40 just for it with out the expansion pack, so this is a good deal.  You also can get the stuff packs for $20 but they just give you more things to buy.  Soon the sims2 bon voyage will be out and that will probably be good too.  <br>  <br>  I suggest buying the sims2 deluxe and the open for buisness expansion pack.  You might have to save a little more money for tax though if you want to get the expansion pack too.<br>  <br>  There's also the sims2 university that one is really good too I like that one or open for business best.<br>  <br>  I hope that this helps you!|`|e5bc9ce7ce1e24e9d830c7f9de3714bfaa	OK well you need the base game you can buy Sims 2 or you can buy Sims 2 deluxe which comes witch nightlife and you need Sims 2 deluxe or the Sims 2 and it costs about like 40$<br>  then i recommend Sims 2 Bon voyage which is coming out on September 5  it is really awesome it will be about like 34 $ and <br>  here are all the other expansion packs open for business, Sims 2 pets , Sims 2 seasons, Sims 2 university , mostly all the expasion pack are about 30$ and if you want to buy and expansion pack and the original sims 2 you will need 80$ if you buy them buy sims 2 bon voyage and sims 2 deluxe

2010ac035ba87fdbaf659bc186e16626aa	You can create just about any kind of store so long as you have the items available through your game.  You can sell furniture, art (both stuff in the normal inventory and stuff your sims paint themself), baked goods, pets, cars, etc.  You can also have sit down restaurants.  Pretty much anything you can buy, you can sell.<br>  <br>  There was a poll on Sims Resource about which business was most successful, I believe most people said that selling wholesale items, like furniture, made the most profit.  I made a bakery and did pretty well.|`|e5bc9ce7ce1e24e9d830c7f9de3714bfaa	well you can own a bakery , a normal store or a restaurant you can also make the store but it will take a  long time so i think the best store that makes the most money is the normal store which you sell like plants furniture and appliances and others

Even the Zoras,<br>  including King Zora have been frozen in Red Ice.  There are such problems in<br>  Hyrule these days.  If you got the Biggoron's Sword then already have the Zora<br>  Tunic and you've freed King Zora, but for old time's sake let's assume you<br>  didn't.  By the way, notice that King Zora hasn't moved for seven years.  What a<br>  bum.  This means that you can go to Zora Fountain, though, and so laziness<br>  finally paid off.<br>  <br>  Go there and notice that Lord Jabu-Jabu is gone (Now Ganondorf's really starting<br>  to tick me off).  He didn't die, though; he's just submerged under the water in<br>  Labrynna (As we find out in Oracle of Ages).  However, Jabu-Jabu left an ice<br>  platform in his place.  Use it and all adjacent ice platforms to reach a piece<br>  of heart.  Then jump to a cave.<br>  This is the first mini-dungeon, but not the last.  The cool thing about mini-<br>  dungeons is that they're twice as easy and you get a dungeon item in them anyway.<br>  Now, a few things to look out for are Ice Keese, slippery floor, and general<br>  hazards (Such as icicles falling from the ceiling).  You start in a hallway.  At<br>  the end of it you'll be in a room with a razor trap.  Avoid it and in the new<br>  room kill the Freezzards (Much-hated enemy), whose breath is ice.  When you kill<br>  them all the door opens.  Go through the tunnel and you'll be in a room with a<br>  large ice-spinning blade thing.  Get the five silver rupees (Three are by the<br>  ice blade.  One is in the air above the exit and one is behind icicles) to<br>  continue.  Go through the tunnel and you'll be in a main room with Blue Fire.<br>  <br>  Bottle up as much as you can (To reach it jump across the icy platforms).  If<br>  you got the Biggoron's Sword this is as far as you've gotten.  Assuming you used<br>  all four of your bottles, you should have four flames.  Hookshot to the<br>  Freezzard and use the Blue Fire on the large chest.  Open it for the Dungeon Map.<br>  Refill your bottle and go back to the ice blade room.  If you have four bottles<br>  each with flames inside, you will have one left over.  Use the Blue Fire on the<br>  Red Ice wall to the (On the map) right.  In the room you find there will be a<br>  treasure chest, a piece of heart, a Gold Skulltula, and Blue Fire.  The chest<br>  has the Compass.<br>  <br>  Refill your bottles and go back to the previous room.  This time use your Blue<br>  Fire on the ice wall to the left, relative the map.  The new room is a silver<br>  rupee room.  You must push the ice block around to access them.  First, kill the<br>  Ice Keese, as being encased in ice can really slow your progress.  Then get the<br>  Gold Skulltula.  You can get two of the silver rupees without using the block.<br>  When you have them push the block up and get that silver rupee.  Then push it to<br>  the right for another.  You'll have to use Blue Fire on this, your fourth silver<br>  rupee.  Now push it into a pit and a new block will form.  Push it left and then<br>  up.  Get the fifth and final silver rupee and fall down.<br>  <br>  Push the block right, up, left, and then up to reach the Blue Fire.  Fill up<br>  your bottles and drop down from the alcove.  Push the block to the left and<br>  it'll fall down a pit, bringing out a new block.  Push it left, up, right, down,<br>  and left.  Now head into the next room via the tunnel.  Use your Blue Fire to<br>  bypass the Red Ice (Only use one bottle) and open the door that is directly<br>  ahead.<br>  No, there is no Boss, only a mini-boss (He is only the mini-boss because this is<br>  only a mini-dungeon).  White Wolfos is just like his gray brethren, very easy.<br>  If you have the Biggoron's Sword switch to the Master Sword so you can easily<br>  use your shield.  One hit with the Master Sword kills him.|`|hdZ4uowwaa	This should awnser all of the walkthrougs<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/N64/ocarinaoftime/ocarinaoftime_cheats.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.neoseeker.com/Games/Products/...</a>|`|qzGC48uraa	try this one

The boss for the Forest Temple is Phantom Ganon, also very easy.

Here is some more information on these three games for you. :)    Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days:  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingdom_Hea...

Although there are other Kingdom Hearts games coming out. Birth by Sleep will come out for PSP. It takes place before Sora was even born. 358/2 days will come out for the DS. Its mostly about Roxas. And last Kingdom Hearts Coded will come for Mobile. Its about Mickey going missing and the castles residents having to solve the mystery.|`|EbazBkpgaa	all those trailers on youtube are for either KH: Birth by Sleep for the PSP or KH: 358/2 days for the DS or KH:coded    three new Kingdom Hearts games that will be released this year     KH:3 is not even in development yet    KH: 358/2 days was suppose to come out on February in Japan but it was not ready so it will come out in spring of this year in japan     game stop has a 9/31/09 release date for this game you can pre-order it today    as for birth by sleep and coded there is no release date for the states|`|H9D4TR53aa	http://www.kingdomhearts3.net/    Go there.

nyCZ6ujfaa	I pre-ordered it off amazon too. You won't have to re-order it, because it did explain that even if the date was moved back that order wouldn't be cancelled.   I live in England, and I have heard speculation about the Sims 3 date being moved back. I checked the sims 3 uk official site and it still says '13 days until sims 3 is released'. In 13 days time it will be February the 20th. I also checked my Amazon order history, that also told me it would be sending me the sims 3 game on the 20th.   I've heard several different dates, so I'm not sure what to believe :S|`|bx63jJVnaa	No the date will change on the website in time, and you'll still have your pre order unless you cancel it.|`|2S8emYmmaa	idk but the sims 3 comes out on feb. 16 i called 2day and asked and they typed it up on the computer and told me feb. 16 but it could be different in the area so you might want 2 call some place lk gamestop (thats wat i called) gamecrazy or any game store and ask then and if they say different im sry its been kinda crazy i have heard 4 different dates good luck!!!|`|7Ca2ns47aa	I highly doubt it, especially if you paid a "down payment." Release dates get pushed back a lot, and I've never had to pre-order it again.|`|JJCSEe3Taa	A pre-order is a pre-order. As long as you don't cancel your pre-order you will get the game as soon as it is released.|`|AA11114139	Just checked the official site..  Its coming out june 2nd :(:(:(|`|zPLza1dSaa	Uhm, haha where do you live? Lol the sims 3 is coming out this month where we are. They said its comin out Feburary. Lol you must live like far awayy.

q48Wn25Saa	Honestly, I don't think you're going to get many good answers here. I would recommend you try asking this in the Dream Interpretation section. I'm sure you'll get more and better answers. <br>  <br>  I would help myself, but I don't have much advice.<br>  <br>  But if I had to say something, I'd say it's probably just a phase. Or perhaps the kind of video games he's playing aren't suitable for an 11-year old. Halo and Call of Duty are war-type of games, with shooting and everything. I'd suggest just waiting until he's older to let him play those types of games. For now, I'd say let him play more kid-friendly games.|`|RjGtp41Zaa	He was probably playing Nazi Zombie mode on Call of Duty. That is a creepy mode in the game where u are in a castle defending it from Zombies. I wouldn't reccomend that mode to any kid who has nightmares. Halo doesn't cause nightmares, it causes Hardcore action dreams with u as the main hero in the dream, lol. Yeah, I wouldn't let him play Call of Duty.|`|8OYQRTUaaa	How old is he?<br>  Yeah, sounds like Nazi Zombies, but I do not have nightmares.<br>  Halo is not scary, Call of Duty (probably World at War) are based on real events that have taken place so maybe just terrified?<br>  <br>  <br>  Nazi Zombies isn't all that scary, all the zombies look the same.|`|Yo3gN9DQaa	as chad said "wut are the dreams about"<br>  u can consult a child psychologist, or u can sit next to him while he plays so he doesnt feel afraid....depending on the dreams.<br>  and also dont let him play games tht rnt for his age group such as 15+ or 18+ many kids get affected by this|`|2dpPZx17aa	wut are the dreams about|`|G3ScsO6haa	i play a lot of video games and sometimes i have terrifying dreams but i just think to myself it is just a cartoon it is not going to hurt you but sometimes it scares me to much that i wake up and can't go back to sleep. <br>  <br>  He is probably just thinking of away to past the game but he focused to hard on it and turns into a nightmare just tell him to calm down and close his eyes.<br>  <br>  hope that helps|`|nEh8Nrdmaa	I play video game ALOT, and sometimes i have bad dreams or just really weird ones. What are the dreams about? Are they scaring him? Maybe he should stop playing these type of games, and play something more his age. It may be boring, but it be worthwhile!|`|zL8KA6eRaa	Quite simply, stop him playing violent video games. Get him playing ones his own age, best probably adventure or racing games. Then, if the nightmares still persist, then either stop him playing video games or consult a psychiatrist.|`|icacOKc6aa	hmm i play halo and its never happend to me. mabey only let your son to play games befor 2hours befor he goes to bed. so if he goes to bed at 9pm make sure he isnt playing games at 7pm so its out of his system. also halo and call of duty have alot of killing in it so that could also affect him. some games id insist on buying for him would be racing games like midnight club or need for speed. hope this helps.
m0V5wSKBaa	Hi. Nice tweaks Ashura. The Anti-Spell Fragrance is indeed a good move for the deck as it enables you to use Yaichi on spells too.<br>  I still think United is too slow a draw system for the build and Anti-Spell will slow it even more though.<br>  I rate it  9/10 also (up 0.5 from my last rate)|`|HOdvH2c1aa	This deck is great, although I think you should add some other tuners other than plaguespreader Zombie since you have quite a few synchros. Krebons would be a safe bet. I also think you should take out one of the Six Samurai United. And how did you get that many solemns and dark bribes, I only have one of each. I rate your deck a 9/10

8hbm4uiPaa	Depends on when you choose to sacrifce the Mogg Raider.<br>  <br>  If you sacrifice the Mogg Raider before damage, it will not deal damage to the creature blocking it, but the +1/+1 counter will go on your other creature before combat damage is stacked, and therefore it will deal its normal damage plus another 1 due the counter.<br>  <br>  If you sacrifice the Mogg Raider after combat damage has been placed on the stack, the Mogg Raider will deal its damage to the creature blocking it, but the +1/+1 counter will not go on unblocked creature you control until after combat damage has been dealt.<br>  <br>  If by some chance you could give the Mogg Raider first-strike, you would be able to put first-strike damage on the stack, then sacrifice him to put a +1/+1 counter on your unblocked creature before normal combat damage was dealt.|`|e6c0dea2b61e835f2262b43b2ed5d1ebaa	Again Davios has it perfectly, but both previous answers are correct.  According to your scenario, damage is on the stack, so nothing would affect that, but what you might do, depending on the creature blocking the Mogg Raider, is either sack the creature before damage is on the stack to get one more point of damage through from the unblocked creature or if you value your Raider and it's being blocked by a 1/1 creature, you could sack the other Goblin to save your Raider, but forgo the damage to the opponent.  If the Raider is going to die not matter what, it would be wise to sack it before damage is on the stack to pump the unblocked Goblin, unlike sacking a Mogg Fanatic after damage is on the stack to do the extra point of damage on top of combat damage.  Knowing the ability and how it works is essential to maximizing the effect you want to see happen.  Last example, if your Mogg Raider is being blocked by a 1/1 creature and you want to see that creature dead, then sacking the raider after damage changes nothing, just trade.  Why leave your opponent an attacker unless you have other blockers that are bigger, but then you would have attacked with those instead of your Raider, unless they just got summoned, etc.  Bottom line, there are many theoriticals, but for your specific scenario, either sack it before damage or just let it resolve, depending on whether you want to do an extra point of damage to your opponent or just damage what is blocking you.|`|9KeaTUh6aa	Yes, it is too late for the pumped goblin's power to affect damage. As you said, damage is already on the stack and cannot be effected by creature pumping/shrinking.
SXi8jyqpaa	Yes, there are thousands of maps with high level heroes.<br>  Look around on <a href="http://epicwar.com/" rel="nofollow">http://epicwar.com/</a> and find some yourself.<br>  Hint: Most RPG, and ORPG maps allow level 100-300 heroes.
Izb2M38Saa	Fables a great game. You can beat as a good, bad, or nuetral hero. If you want a game that your choices seriously effect the path of the game, Fable 2 is for you. I bought it, beat it being all good, then beat it being all evil, and now playing it being whatever I feel like. Add to it good (AND EARLY) DLC, really shows how much the makers of the game care for it. This early of DLC shows that they must be planning even more in the future for fable 2. It's the kind of game that keeps on growing, so I'd buy it. <br>  <br>  However, if you are more of the FPS/racer kinda guy, and don't enjoy 3rd person adventure games, then this is obviously a pass. It's all about your tastes. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|OsBYx2itaa	It's really fun, but I don't know if it's worth the buy. I bought it and played it for a few days before I got bored with the open-ended content and ended up getting distracted by other things. I've yet to pick it up.<br>  <br>  It's a cool and innovative game, but I'd strongly suggest renting and playing around with it before dropping 50~ dollars on something you may only play for a couple of days.|`|JvgX4xJTaa	Personally i would rent it. I rented it and was done with it within 3 days. But that was before Knothole island DLC came out. BUt i've also heard that the DLC dosen't have that much play time, only extra goodies. In the end its your choice but I would definatly only rent it.|`|wpotbup5aa	its a good game... but wait for it to be 20 bucks used at ebgames or gamestop. <br>  <br>  its kewl game and all but it doesnt feel like a free roam game because there is a sparkly line that tells you were to go all the time... <br>  <br>  here is a good video review on it if you want first link is standard deff and second link is HD. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42025.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42025...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42024.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.gametrailers.com/player/42024...</a>|`|KJ5QE7UWaa	fable 2 is definetly fun and if you liked the first fable, you will like fable 2 better because of the more variety of goods and actions and the plot is better.

That's also why the Crimson Crisis Sneak Preview got canceled until the end of the month.  It kind of work out for everybody though as to make up for it, we got Upper Deck Day.

6GIrW5eWaa	The maps that you are referencing (Seelow, Downfall, and Airfield) are all part of the online multiplayer maps currently being played.

4ZmHOQVVaa	No that doesn't happen, it was either a freak fluke, coincidence, or your friend was lying.

If you buy a new copy of Legend of Dragoon, your save data will still work, provided you haven't corrupted it yourself somehow.    You could try boiling the disc to clean some scratches, but only use that as a last resort before buying a new copy as it's risky.  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pWNW2guT...     Also, great game. Haven't played it in years. VOLCANO!    Good luck. =) Hope you get to finish this game, it's a classic.|`|2PB9RKrcaa	I have an answer for you, however it will require a purchase.    Look into getting a cheap mod chip that will plug into the back of your PS1 (NOT a mod chip that actually looks like a computer chip). But a simple, mod device that plugs into the rear port.    The one that comes with 'The magic spring'.  I used to have one, but its been so long since I sold it, I cannot remember what it was or where to look to get one (online, ebay prob).   The chip will allow you to A.) Play burnt games you download online  B.) The device will have an onboard gameshark system (for easy cheats).   C.) The device will allow you to browse through alot of the files and videos in the game, I remember the ability to shut DOWN ingame cinematics for my Final Fantasy 8.  1 Particular cinematic that caused the game to freeze (exactly like your issue).  I told the video through the mod device to not play, and when I reached that point, it skipped the cinematic, moved onto the next scene, and BOOM i could finish the game.    I hope this helps, I know this isnt a direct easy answer, but it is a solution for you.  Good luck!
DTlFaJkaaa	If you're into mmo's then get WoW, but it's crap imo.  I just dont see how millions of people nejoy that garbage... I guess I just don't see it as entertainment.    If you're into online FPS games, then both L4D and CoD5 are good choices, but atm, cod5 is seriously in need of several patches in order to fix all the bugs and glitches.  L4D has already has several patches, and has DLC coming along with SDK tools (which will let people mod the game and make custom maps).|`|rd6FhBBBaa	I have WoW and CoD4.

Most times you do not get your  money back in value out of those kinds of boxes.    That way you get the exact card you want. Now if you just want some good fun pulling autos and game used jerseys I would recommend taking a look at hot packs. You could get like 100 hot packs for the same price of one of those boxes.    100 auto/jerseys or 5?

PK9qQiLzaa	I found GTA 4 to be way way better. but it really depends on the types of games you like to play. i really like playing shooting games so i liked gta but fallout 3 was just like oblivion only in the futur. It's basically a role playing game that takes a lot of time to do little missions.

I personally found gta to be way more entertaining for a lot longer of a time.|`|htlaV6K5aa	i believe fallout is better, i didnt like gta4 AT ALL.<br>  but, they're totally different, fallout is a RPG, and gta is an action game with terrible driving.|`|nVg4xiTuaa	I like GTA 4 better i guess but they are very different games so its hard to compare them.

btjn2j8Waa	you will get no answers i have played runescape for 2 years and your question makes no sense|`|7045569549a16a88ad40754be0b4a6f3aa	I'm taking a stab at what your asking.<br>  <br>  "How can a level 22 combat wield the dragon sword?"<br>  <br>  He'd have to be an attack pure ( level 60 ) & done a lot of training on the target dummies in Lumbridge in order to get those levels without leveling anything else.|`|mmzsEypTaa	Umm, your question is not very clear, but, it is impossible to be able to wield a dragon sword on a level 22, because of the constant leveling of Hp, this with your attack level will go above 40 before u can use it.|`|U3a5zPNJaa	wtf r u asking i play it all the time and dont know wut a sworld is?

Dso7k3sjaa	Well, whether it is a brand new computer or not, it still might not be capable of playing the sims 2 games, or playing them well.  But, every time I've bought a new computer I have had to update my video drivers as they are always out-of-date.  I've never been able to figure out why that is since it's a brand new computer but I've still had to do it with every new computer.<br>  <br>  So, try that first.  It's free to do and cannot hurt it.  If your video card is an Nvidia card, go to Nvidia's site and download the latest driver.  If it's an ATI card, then go to ATI's site.  If you bought a brand new laptop, try going to the manufacturer of your laptop to get new drivers.<br>  <br>  If you don't know how to figure out what kind of video card you have, then give the name and model of your computer and we can try to help more.<br>  <br>  But -- there are a lot of brand new computers that do not meet the minimum requirements to play the game well.  Especially if it's a laptop.  The Sims 2 requires a fairly good cpu and video card, despite what many people might think.  But before assuming that your brand new computer just can't play the game, I would update the drivers.  That may be all that is needed.|`|AA11850311	in addition to updating your graphics drivers (thumbs up to Sims2Player!)<br>  make sure you have the latest patches for Pets & Bon Voyage (Double Deluxe does not need a patch)<br>  <a href="http://thesims2.ea.com/update/index.php" rel="nofollow">http://thesims2.ea.com/update/index.php</a><br>  Do you have any custom content that may be causing a problem?<br>  <a href="http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Game_Help:Finding_Problem_Custom_Content" rel="nofollow">http://modthesims2.com/wiki.php?title=Ga...</a>|`|tHFY2hg4aa	I would recommend optimizing your computer settings. Unless you have a video card that has more than 128 VRAM, your game is going to be a little twitchy until you change some settings in the game.<br>  <br>  First, go into the graphic settings in your Sims 2 options menu. You have to at least enter one of the neighborhoods to have access to it. <br>  <br>  What you want to try first is reducing the screen resolution that the game uses. Hit the apply button at the bottom and when it asks you if you want to keep the settings, click yes.<br>  <br>  If that doesn't improve the games performance, try reducing some of the other graphic settings that are used to make the game look more real. Odds are you will only have to lower the resolution though. Best of luck.<br>  <br>  PS ... you can find a list of your computers specifications such as video card memory and other stuff under the start menu, programs, applications, system tools, system information

Google national Scrabble association and see if there is a Scrabble club near you.  Sounds like you may enjoy thcompetitionon it would offer!|`|YiBvzIHsaa	Yes, higher than average for sure.|`|RvEnbEJcaa	Yeah, it's pretty good.  well done.|`|bd91d166f8f95cebc78ff9f54d7c2786aa	For regular recreational players, it's probably above average.<br>  <br>  If you averaged 316 at the Scrabble club I play at, you'd have the 29th highest average out of 31 players.

You should really save often so it does not happen again.<br>  PLEASE REMEMBER THAT.|`|a38693fKaa	Alright I can help you, the way to feed properly would be to go indoors somewhere, maybe a tavern, and wait until after dark. Then sneak into a hotel somewhere and find someone asleep. Feed on them so that you shall not get and sun damage for a day. Then travel to Skingrad. The count there is actually a vampire! He will give you a quest to find many potions and ingredients and such to cure his dying wife of vampirism, and to cure yourself. Just remember to keep feeding every night in different hotels and such so you do not have any sun damage effects. If you do happen to miss a night of feeding, do not WAIT outdoors! You will die. If you don't know how to WAIT, press the back button on your controller. This will bring up the wait screen, and will allow you to pass time in the game in seconds. If the count will not give you the quest, you should ask around town in skingrad about him and the quest will eventually come up.|`|exep6XWlaa	Ok, to cure vamparism you can either go to Weynon Priory and pray at the altar or go to the count of Skingrad and initiate a quest that curese it. <br>  <br>  Thats all i can think of.

QWHpXlNCaa	What that probably is is when you restored you computer the previous date that date you selected was past the point where the driver for the game was installed on your computer. your computer no longer has the driver to run the program-probably possibly. what you can do is go to Windows main site and update all possible updates. you can't update just once either. you have to update then check again for more updates because some updates do no become available until another update is installed. So keep going back and updating until it tells you no updates are available. then that driver will most undoubtedly be there to run the game installation with. good luck!<br>  <br>  p.s.: this question did not really belong in this category..it is a computer tech question

meydzNWWaa	You could try using a different controller. But the return policy sounds like a bunch of BS to me... I'd call a different GameStop and ask the return policy IF you bought a refurb 360... dont say you already have one. Say you're considering buying one and would like to know if you could return it if you didn't like it or if the console you got was defective. But i think thats a bunch of CRAP. your first mistake was to consider a 360 in the first place... They're always ******* up in some way. they have such a high failure rate its ridiculous (mostly to overheating) Even with their obnoxiously loud fans... See if you could exchange it for a ps3?|`|9e4ac0e2f225b1c69ed1f6d14c9e1d09aa	microsoft didnt say that and even if they did refurbished is not new and plus it had 7 days so he cant refuse to take it if he keeps on doing that ask who his boss is and talk to them|`|gB5ATj7aaa	Tell him he shouldn't have sold it then. As it was needed to be opened by someone for the refurb. And the box would have been opened on the first purchase.<br>  <br>  microsoft's /warranty/ is voided if you open the /console/, not the box. And as I said it's probably already been opened for the refurb.<br>  <br>  If he means the box, he's insane (but don't tell him that x))<br>  <br>  tell him you're well within the time allowed to return<br>  <br>  point out that the console is not working the way it should be (not fit for it's purpose etc..) <br>  <br>  then slip in something about trading standards if he's not budging.

7Ca2ns47aa	You cannot use The Sims 2 expansion packs for The Sims 3, though, I have no doubt that they will make the same/different expansion packs for The Sims 3. I really don't think The Sims 3 will have the same things that the expansion packs do from The Sims 2 (like vacations, pets, your own business, etc.) If EA were to put all of the expansion into one game then they'd lose large amounts of money.  Just keep in mind that expansion packs are just another way for the gaming industry to make a lot more money. They'll make expansion packs, guaranteed.|`|IiKmxWULaa	i don't know for sure but i think the sims 3 will have all the sims 2 expansion packs and more. <br>  <br>  i dunno though.|`|th6wx3T1aa	i think you can|`|ttndIYgFaa	Its so annoying, that we cant, well thats what i have heared around australia.

154dzJ1Faa	You already know everything there is to know about knitting.  Well, okay, you have the basics, but anything else is just an extension or a variation of the same stitches.  You can do anything from now on.  You are only limited by yourself.<br>  <br>  Simple is not always the best thing to do.  It doesn't challenge you.  You won't grow by doing simple all the time.  I get my beginners FROM THE VERY START to knit a hat in the round.  We don't bother with scarves -- they will do that later one day.  But they learn much more on a hat.  Then we do mittens, and then we do socks.  After that, they can tackle a cable sweater... nothing to it!<br>  <br>  I really enjoy knitting lace.  That is the ultimate of simple!  It actually is really quite boring to do.  You don't even need to be awake to do that!  You should have a couple projects at the same time.  One is a very large, and very long-term project.  It's what you work on little by little, there is no deadline, you do it when you are in that mood.  And you should also have something that is mindless knitting, that you can do while talking to friends, or watching TV, and have something that is more interesting, is a challenge, or something as a gift for someone special (or yourself). Then you have the perfect project for the right time.  Oh, and have something for knitting when travelling.  And something small to keep in your bag all the time.  Have you thought of fingerless gloves?  <br>  <br>  There are cable patterns -- those are quite fun to do, and you already know what to do there.  Try the Irish Hiking Scarf... free pattern, very easy, looks fantastic!  You can make it into a bag, or part of a sweater.  Any pattern can be made into a bag.  And have you ever felted anything? What a hoot!  You make a big floppy hat or sock or bag... and then felt it in the washer!  And it magically becomes something firm and solid, and so useful!  <br>  <br>  Oh, there is no end to things you can do.  Just get started.|`|AA12177717	I'd suggest a simple baby sweater.  Yes, yes, yes, you aren't pregnant and don't need one.  Well, I usually have one floating around for an instant shower gift, to be honest.  A baby sweater will teach you increases, decreases, shaping, seaming, and picking up stitches.  Not that scarves and dish cloths aren't bad, but this is a greater skill building option.  One other option I didn't see mentioned is a skills building afghan.  Both Leisure Arts and Barbara Walker have *learn to knit* afghan patterns out there that build your skills as you knit afghan squares.  Not a bad thought for you.  You may have to order the Leisure Arts booklet from them, the Walker book is available from Schoolhouse Press or may be obtainable to borrow through your local library.|`|9hpuBMuIaa	There are so many things that you could make.  Don't say "not a scarf", you can make hundreds of scarves and not have 2 of them the same design.  Scarves give you great experience in learning new stitches, patterns, techniques &  if you start with them you will not only have learned a lot but will have Christmas gifts done for next year.  A lot of new knitters(men, women and children) start with dishcloths( yes a lot of people prefer them) you can make a dishcloth pattern into a scarf, table runner, afghan, shawl or stole, just by lengthening them or doing repeats of the pattern.  I have been knitting 50 yrs but couldn't name all of the things that you could make.  Go to your library and check through the craft section you should be able to find pattern books with beginners patterns in them. It is fairly easy to learn to read a basic pattern, but if you have problems, go to yarn shops, knitting clubs and ask for help or advice.  Those are just a few of my suggestions.|`|IUpIHFTKaa	There are many things you can make as a beginning knitter.<br>  <br>  Here are a couple of sites with good ideas and directions:<br>  <a href="http://www.knitting-crochet.com/knisti.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.knitting-crochet.com/knisti.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.learntoknit.com/project_ideas.php3" rel="nofollow">http://www.learntoknit.com/project_ideas...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.coatsandclark.com/Crafts/FreeProjects/" rel="nofollow">http://www.coatsandclark.com/Crafts/Free...</a>|`|bMwk4VGYaa	Check out the Lion Brand site.<br>  They offer free patterns with free membership.<br>  <a href="http://www.lionbrand.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.lionbrand.com/</a><br>  They rate their patterns beginner, easy, etc.....<br>  Try pot holders, dish cloths, eye glass holder, cell phone/I pod holder, small clutch...Their are lots of items.

Turn, knit two, increase, knit two.  Turn.  Knit two, increase, knit to end of row.  Keep doing this until the short sides of the triangle are as long as you want the square to be.  Then....knit two, DECREASE, knit to end of row.  Keep repeating that row, decreasing after the first two stitches in each row, until you have only a few stitches left on the needle.  Generally, I end the item when I have between four and seven stitches left on the needle, depending on how it looks.  Bind off, work in the loose ends.  The increases and decreases will form a nice decorative band near the edges.  You may, if you want to, single or double crochet around the edges.<br>  <br>  This square will make a nice baby blanket, or washcloth, or pillow.  Using a variegated yarn makes an interesting pattern.  I've made several of these as baby blankets, and also as cat blankets.  My cats love knitted and crocheted blankets, so it's easier to just make some for them out of cheap yarn.<br>  <br>  This pattern is easy to follow (you only have to count to two!) and it's excellent practice for increasing and decreasing.|`|9hpuBMuIaa	If you use your search engine and type in free knitting patterns you will find links to literally hundreds of patterns.

You need to join, but just sign up and ask for an invite.  It will come in just a few days and then you will spend all of your free time trying to find the perfect pattern. I am very experienced but make many simple patterns just for the fun of doing them. Some other sites are knitty.com, berroco.com, lionbrand yarn site.  I could write all day and not list them all.|`|GlaARFZcaa	This website is a great source for free knitting patterns - there's tons of projects to choose from:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.favecrafts.com/Knitting" rel="nofollow">http://www.favecrafts.com/Knitting</a>|`|154dzJ1Faa	You already know everything there is to know about knitting. Well, okay, you have the basics, but anything else is just an extension or a variation of the same stitches. You can do anything from now on. You are only limited by yourself.<br>  <br>  Simple is not always the best thing to do. It doesn't challenge you. You won't grow by doing simple all the time. I get my beginners FROM THE VERY START to knit a hat in the round. We don't bother with scarves -- they will do that later one day. But they learn much more on a hat. Then we do mittens, and then we do socks. After that, they can tackle a cable sweater... nothing to it!<br>  <br>  I really enjoy knitting lace. That is the ultimate of simple! It actually is really quite boring to do. You don't even need to be awake to do that! You should have a couple projects at the same time. One is a very large, and very long-term project. It's what you work on little by little, there is no deadline, you do it when you are in that mood. And you should also have something that is mindless knitting, that you can do while talking to friends, or watching TV, and have something that is more interesting, is a challenge, or something as a gift for someone special (or yourself). Then you have the perfect project for the right time. Oh, and have something for knitting when travelling. And something small to keep in your bag all the time. Have you thought of fingerless gloves?<br>  <br>  There are cable patterns -- those are quite fun to do, and you already know what to do there. Try the Irish Hiking Scarf... free pattern, very easy, looks fantastic! You can make it into a bag, or part of a sweater. Any pattern can be made into a bag. And have you ever felted anything? What a hoot! You make a big floppy hat or sock or bag... and then felt it in the washer! And it magically becomes something firm and solid, and so useful!<br>  <br>  Oh, there is no end to things you can do. Just get started.<br>  <br>  (btw, knitting curls up when you do an unbalanced stitch, such as stocking stitch, not because it is knit horizontal! )

82EQV1EEaa	I own both and Sims 2 is definitely better and will give you hours of entertainment - bought spore because i was told it was as good as but have hardly played it after the original go.  Oh and if you are a sims fan the Sim 3 launches in June- cant wait.|`|7o4PXaQEaa	Sims 2 is just a pretty fun game overall, and spore is more RTS-ey (Real Time Strategy)<br>  It would depend on what kind of games you play, if you like the previous sims, get that, if you don't mind either way, get spore for the experience.<br>  Though don't go online in spore, creating your own creature has gotten all the 13-year-olds to grow themselves an online penis. (shudder)|`|meydzNWWaa	Sims 2 for sure. But if you wait till june Sims 3!!!! is coming out... Should be pretty damn sweet.|`|OKZkABDqaa	SIMS 2 !!|`|8ZBsR4Rpaa	sims 2, spore is lame.
H6IE7xeaaa	With what little research I've conducted on the game, it seems as if it is probably much too large to play simply over the internet. (Could be wrong as I don't know a whole lot about the bandwith requirements for online gaming) It also appears that there are no free downloads of the full game, so buying the full version is probably your best bet. Otherwise, (and I don't condone this) you could try searching a p2p program (limewire, bearshare, etc...) beware, it is illegal to get software this way and could also lead to viruses.

3Iyu7hrcaa	You cut the deck because as people are shuffling the bottom card can get exposed.  <br>  <br>  And I you don't play with him otherwise.  If you want to cut, then you cut.  If you really think he's stacking the deck, then you shouldn't play.|`|UVUYG5jaaa	your allowed to cut the deck, reshuffle, or get a new deck if you wish. anyone can cheat? including your best friend|`|y822j5h5aa	In a house game you should be sure the rules are clear, especially if you are playing with friends, you may lose a one over a card game argument. <br>  <br>  Traditionally, the dealer should always offer a cut to the person on his right after shuffling. After all, a card or two could have been exposed during the shuffle, and this is just plain poker courtesy. I would want to offer a cut just to ensure there is no question at all of an honest deal. <br>  <br>  Perhaps he protests too much? Anyone who refuses a cut in poker after shuffling is hiding something. Don't sit at the tables with him anymore.|`|BDEVP4qpaa	I don't think it would be "necesary" but its always good to ask the players if they wish to cut the deck.  I always cut the deck myself after shuffling just so there won't be any problems like the one you're having. He shouldn't be getting mad for that. Its poker and cheating CAN occur so I dont think youre the one doing the wrong thing. The way I look at it, if you wish to cut the deck then he should let you. Or if anything have him cut the deck himself before handing out the cards. Simple as that. :P<br>  Hope that helps
