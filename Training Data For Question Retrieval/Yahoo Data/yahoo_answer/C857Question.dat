20090205191505AArKWxs	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	For "how much house can I afford" calculators, what counts as credit card payments if I never carry balances?	My credit card bills come to about $2000 a month, but I NEVER use cash for anything-- these amounts reflect our total monthly expenditures on _everything_.  None of this is paying back "debt" -- so do I put $0 in the "monthly credit card debt" blank of most "how much X can I afford" calculators, or the full $2000, or some percentage that reflects fixed monthly payments like utilities....?   The calculators tell me I can afford nothing when I put the full amount in, and that I can afford beyond what I think I might when I put in 0....
20090205191518AAMawie	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	We live in Binghamton NY and a friend of mine is having issues with her landlord...?	We live in Binghamton (Broome County) NY. A friend rented an apartment at the beginning of November. Since then, she has not done any of the work in the apartment that she was supposed to. There a pipe leaking in the ceiling in the bathroom, parts of the ceiling in the bathroom are missing... they just took them down rather than have them getting ruined by the leaking pipe, there is a small section of wall in one bedroom where the sheet rock and insulation are missing, you can reach in and touch the wood behind the siding. My friend was allowed to use the basement when she moved in, and 2 months later the landlord says she isn't allowed to put anything down there. Her lease says no one is allowed to 'reside' in the basement, but it doesn't say no one is allowed to store things down there, and when she first moved in she had things stored there and the landlord didn't care. Now her boyfriend is living there and her landlord says she is going to up the rent $50 a month even though my friend is the one who pays the electricity and heat bill. The lease says nothing about my friend being the only one allowed to live there. Is the landlord allowed to do this? Is there anything my friend can do?

I went to a career fair at my alma mater this morning and I must say it was quite discouraging. I have a degree in advertising and marketing and it seemed that most of the jobs there were "store management trainee" and entry-level retail management type jobs. There were also a lot of insurance companies. Also it seemed like most of the companies were STILL sending people online. (which history shows doesn't work for me). I am a little disheartened becasue I am looking for more of a corporate-office type marketing position at an agency or corporate office. My question is...are job fairs really just a waste of time, has anyone been successful?

I just read an article about how airlines are going to raise prices more and tack on extra fees for additional in flight comforts because sales were down for January. Is this the right thing to do for our failing world economy?       At first, it makes sense to raise prices in order to make more money, but given our current state, wouldn't that just mean that fewer and fewer people would actually be able to afford tickets?       Maybe I'm missing the bigger picture here, but wouldn't it help to stimulate the economy by lowering the price and offering deals? This might draw more people, thus banking more money.      In times of economic crises, which is better...raising prices due to low customer sales, or lowering prices to stimulate the economy and draw in more potential buyers? What's your thoughts?

20090205204225AAImyfg	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	I need help with a verbally abusive manager?	I am a top detailer at a major auto sales store. I try my best and I do a good job. There is the manager in charge of the "back" (mechanics, detailers, paint ect) that is to the point of being verbally abusive to everyone. He calls people names like "f*g, a**hole, jerk, loosers and so on. You will detail a car and then he will try to not pay you for it saying, "you are only here for the money" He has thrown things at people, cursed, yelled and basically terrorized the back. Oh, and he will threaten to fire you on almost a daily basis even though he does not have the authority to do that and you do nothing wrong, I was threatened one time because i took the required break of 30 min's and wanted to eat lunch rather then work through it with no pay.      I am sick of it. So me and another employee went to the general manager of the store and told him in confidence everything that was going on. I told him that it was to the point I wanted to transfer, that I didn't want anything happening to his job because he does have a family and I would feel guilty if he got fired especially in this economy BUT I personally could no longer take it anymore. The general manager promised to keep everything in confidence.      But he told EVERYTHING to the tyrant. So now, I am having to deal with him spitting on me, yelling and again, threatening to fire me for telling. The other employee took the day off for a funeral, so he has no idea that he knows. I am angry that the general manager told. I expected him to have a talk, but why did he have to use names? I am now wanting to go to corporate but I don't want any more repurcussions then I have already experienced. I need this job desperately, no one is hiring in the area, trust me, I've looked. I don't know what to do, any advice??      I should mention that he actually sprayed chemicals in someones face and they pressed charges against him. He did this in front of the entire back, probably close to 20 people. The management knew and he still wasn't fired, he has had about 30 complaints about him through various people.....and nothing ever happens, it's like he is invincable. I've been there for 2 years and took it for that long, it's just too much to handle anymore. I can no longer take it.

20090205210017AA4jhoa	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Hey everyone! I need your help with a little something please?	Ok, so I'm going on a job interview tomorrow. I know the basics, dress professionally yada yada..But with previous experiences, at job interviews, the interviewer tends to ask out of the blue questions that you don't normally hear everyday. The one question I hate the most is "So, what do you feel you can accomplish by being a part of our company''    I have no idea to say to that and as genuine as I possibly can I try and answer but I'm very nervous. Basically it's a customer service agent for a health supply company. Can anyone give me some suggestions to what you think they might ask me? I just want to make some mental notes so I'm prepared tomorrow. I hate being put on the spot because no matter how confident a person is, you DO get pretty nervous    *laughs nervously*

The references seem extremely flaky, due to circumstance, but,    essentially the other references besides their mom, well they do not know anymore , these people either moved away or something, or they don't like each other anymore. i.e. ex boyfriend   They have limited work experience and they afraid to go on any job interviews due to the lack of experience, but they worked in 2008 for the summer in a restaurant as wait staff and 2009 for the summer same job someplace else, and also volunteered at a casino restaurant, and a swap meet , would this be enough experience for you to hire someone and their only references are their mom (they worked for their mom's family buisiness) and their sister and they have no other references because they are not a very social person ? They are social at work, as necessary to do the job.
20090205202707AATRSYF	Business & Finance;Careers & Employment;Other - Careers & Employment	Wait staff job, and I have horribly flaky job & personal references , what can I do to get a job?	I am afraid that a manager will HATE seeing this, but I have:  My X boyfriend and I worked together in the swap meet, he stalked me when we broke up and I got a restraining order against him he went to jail so using him is out of the question.  Then I volunteered in a casino but m mom got the gig singing and I was helping to serve food and drinks there. So that reference is my mom and they don't like for you to use parents and people in your family.  And then another place I worked at went out of business and no one can find the owner to call him about getting paid even.  So all of my references are weak, or they are family members, or they are in jail, or missing.  What in the world can I do ? I do have one other references for a summer job as wait staff but I worked under a different name and they never even asnwer the phone anyways and I doubt they would remember me, because they hire new people ALL the time, people come and go like air through this place. So that leaves me with only my mom as a reference, I'm terrified to go to any job interview like this, does anyone have any suggestions? I am really good at my job though when i do have a job. I have good grades also.

I work in Mexico, in a very preppy and expensive middle school.       I own my own business, I employ people to run my business. I don't really need my teaching job.       In this preppy school, no one is accepted unless they already speak English. They don't take English classes, they have the same school curriculum and material as any American middle school. I was called 6 months ago, they told me they REALLY needed a some who could teach 8th Grade English Literature, so I accepted the job.       From the beginning, I noticed the rich kids at this school were very spoiled and totally out of control. I wanted to quit from the beginning, but I stayed because I liked the idea of teaching English Literature.       From the beginning I had trouble with the students' discipline. The principal told me she was not happy with the students' discipline, but she hadn't heard any complaints about my English, so she'd give me another chance.      Last week, the students got totally out of control. The principal AGAIN warned me I could lose my job. So I told her I wanted to quit. She then asked if I could wait 'til the end of the school year.      I was surprised, but I realized that it was really difficult for the school to find another teacher who could teach English Literature in Mexico, so they had to keep me, even if I have trouble with some students.      My boss knows I don't need the job and that I want to quit, so she can't scare me with firing me,       She knows it's hard to find a replacement for me,      What would you do if you were my boss?

20090205203103AARK4VA	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	Recasting mortgage (i.e. reamortizing) vs. refinancing?	In September I bought a house for 255K.  After down payment the mortgage principle is 242K, 30 year term, 5.87%.  In October I sold my other property and now have 175K payment I would like to make towards my mortgage.        I want to know if I'm better off making a large lump sum payment and asking the mortgage company to reamortize with the same terms and interest rate.  Or if I should actually refinance, get a new interest rate and 15 year term.        Also I was lead to believe that if I refinance, since it would be a rather small mortgage loan (@65K), that I would NOT qualify to get the most competitive rates (like 5 or 5.1%), maybe only reduce interest rate to about 5.5%.  Does that sound right for those of you in the know about mortgages?        Also what is considered the break even point for paying closing costs to get the better rate/payment terms?  Is it simply a matter of whether you save overall in comparison to the what the total payments would have been under the previous conditions.  Or is it that you need to be in the property for a certain number of years?  What is the real deal?      I'd love to hear your thoughts and advice.  Thanks

My plans now are to continue leasing through mid 2010 and move back in when my pention and ss kick in (can afford it then). However, this will only work if I can refinance before March 2010.

20090205204818AAXVP6H	Business & Finance;Renting & Real Estate	My Landlord is planning on calling the police and my dad wants to sue?	Basically, my family was evacuated from the house we are renting 2 weeks ago.   The landlord told us to stay at a hotel.   But because of the fire and 3 days we couldn't reach her, my parents lost 3 days worth of pay.   My dad and the landlord talked and she said that she'll pay for all of the damages (that's what my dad told me)   Now, she's telling us that she's only returning the deposit and the left over money form the rent.   Since she's not willing to pay up for the days my parents didn't work, nor the hotel, we thought it would be sensible to go back to the house because we have no other place to stay.   I got an e-mail from her today telling us to get out or she'll have to bring the police in.      I already know about renter's insurance, but I'm pretty sure my dad didn't get it. but i have what she said about us staying at a hotel in writing. But according to the lease contract, the lease is terminated when there is a fire (or something like that)      I guess the problem is: we want to stay for 7 more days, but she wants to call the police and go back on her words.      If my dad were to take this to court, who'd win?
