20090220233256AAusK1h	Food & Drink;Cooking & Recipes	Need some tips on cooking shrimp?	My family loves shrimp, but I hate to eat plain old boiled shrimp cold; we like to eat it hot. The only way I know to cook it is to fry it in some butter and garlic, but (a) it always seems to come out too tough, and (b) I end up in the kitchen forever because my pan only holds enough shrimp for one-two servings if I lay them in a single layer.      Any tips for getting my shrimp to come out just right, and to avoid cooking 5 different helpings individually? I'd be willing to boil them, if we could eat them hot, and they had some kind of flavoring.

Does anyone know or have a clone recipe for the drink at Bennigan's called: "Blarney Blast"?  It is a green-ish orange frozen drink that tastes like limes even though they would swear to me that it was mango.  It was really good and I cannot find a Bennigan's drink menu anywhere now that they have all closed down over here, ebay never has any and i've googled it several times and came up empty handed.  Any help would be appreciated!! Thanks!!!
