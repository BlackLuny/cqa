I have an older Goodman package heat pump (model PH-030-1A ser # 9701048386) that  I believe the compressor has overheated and gone out...I came home one day and the cooling fan on top was just barely turning and the compressor wand everything was HOT.....I replaced the cooling fan but the compressor doesnot seem to start and I get no heating or cooling... My question is should I see about having the compressor replaced and the unit recharged or am I just spending good money after bad... I have just a little over 1000 square feet to heat and cool but the only heat I can get out of this thing is from the emergency heat strips....Any suggestions would be appreciated...

20090222051158AAMlWRP	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	My ceilings been painted with watered down paint more water then paint how is it going to effect it?	I paid someone to paint my popcorn acoustic ceiling in my bedroom.  I think he tried to rip me off and instead of painting it, I think he mixed flat wall paint with water in a hand sprayer and just sprayed the ceiling to clean it and make it appear more white.  I never saw a single bucket of paint, or any rollers, there was no taping anything off, or using something to cover my floor or plastic for the walls etc.  The ceiling looks like puffy mash potatoes.  It looks about 3 times the size it use to be, like white clouds.  Plus there is a ring around my ceiling fan that extends outward about 5' and its a different color then the rest of the ceiling.  How would I know if he sprayed it with water vs painting it?  AND if he did over wet the ceiling, what will happen from here?  If there is water trapped behind the acoustic now, will it weigh it down and start falling off?  Will the water dry out eventually?  Will it mold under the acoustic popcorn?  Does a painted acoustic ceiling look like puffy clouds 3" thick when painted for the first time?   Is it possible to paint it wihtout leaving any type of mess at all?  What should I do?

20090222140309AAUTStZ	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	Red coat transfers red color to other clothes?	I have bought a red wool winter coat. The interior lining is red polyester.      The problem is that when I wear the coat, it stains my clothes red. It's not as obvious on dark clothes. But I recently wore a white cardigan, and the red coat stained it pretty badly. Washing it didn't get the color out. Hopefully, bleaching it will help...otherwise, the cardigan is ruined.      How can I stop the coat from transferring the red color onto my clothes? Can I wipe the lining down with something? I can't throw the coat in a washing machine because it is dry clean only (as most coats are, I guess).      If I have it dry cleaned, will this fix my problem?

20090222122416AAAMN2j	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Problems with hot water?	I asked this the other day, but I don't believe i did a good job of wording it.  So here goes again.      Let's say I turn on the hot water faucet in my bathroom, it takes 10-15 seconds or more to get hot water out, which of course is normal, Then Let's say I turn the bathroom hot water faucet off. Then I turn the same faucet back on again 10 seconds later.  The water is cold already and I have to wait 10-15 seconds or longer for it to get hot again. Assuming that once I have hot water coming out of the faucet, the water in the line from the hot water heater all the way to the faucet is now hot, how can it be coming out cold 10 seconds later? Water does not cool off in 10 seconds.  Also I live in Florida so the attic and walls are always warm/hot. Any help would be appreciated.

My washing machine fills with water when its not been in use for a few days, it smells like old sewage water when it pumps out. Detergant water also comes up in my plug hole of the sink, but only slightly. I've tried boiling water and drain unblocker products down the drain in the sink but nothing has worked? Has anyone had this problem or know maybe why this is happening? I'm just praying its not the machine!

Anyone have any websites or local nurseries that sell wholesale pots for cheap? I read some people bought 500 for like $20-$40...       My local nursery sells each 4" pot for $0.49 each one. I don't know if they'll wholesale though

20090222125430AAtZSR8	Home & Garden;Cleaning & Laundry	How can I get my white underwear white again?	I have a lot of clothes that are white, mainly underwear really. Some of my cardigans have gone yellow in places, particularly under the arms. Also some of my bras have gone grey. I don't want to get rid of them because they aren't very old.      I have tried Dylon Power Whitener a few times but it doesn't seem to have helped. I don't want to spend much money really as i'm only a student. Wondered if anybody knew of any home remedy's or cheap things i can buy?      Thank you for you help

20090222134030AAvnlb4	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	What two colors should I paint my bedroom walls? P.S. I'm a teenage girl.?	Hi. :) I'm 14, VERY creative, fun, and love anything that's unique (but not weird), and I love to be colorful. :)      Ok, so I'm moving soon and for my bedroom I wanted to paint it 2 colors, not 1, making it more unique. (:   My Current Ideas For My Bedroom Are: (After thinking.....)      -Opposite Walls are a cute shade of pink      -The other opposite walls are plain white      -On the Plain White Walls, I could decorate it with accents/jewelry/just decorate it with stuff. :)   BUT the thing is I'm not exactly sure what COLORS I should make these accents/decorations. So could you guys tell me what color I should do for that? (I was thinking maybe black, lime green, or maybe even a playful orange) But still, ideas will help. (:       These are my ideas SO FAR, I'm not positively done yet. So can you guys give me your honest opinion on what you think so far?   And also, any new ideas would be great, as well as any other paint colors you guys think I should paint my bedroom walls.      -ty <33 (sorry if it's quite long.)

20090222135354AAjws5W	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Leveling freshly tilled ground for grass?	This past winter I had 2/3s of an acre cleared of stumps and brush. When the ground thaws I will install sprinklers and roto till the soil for grass planting. I would like to know the best option rather then raking the ground smooth. Tilling leaves high and low spots that need to be leveled and settled before the grass goes down. Would just a drum roller be best? perhaps to go as far as the fence type material used by baseball fields to level the infield? Raking that much space would just not be possible from a labor standpoint. Your thoughts?
