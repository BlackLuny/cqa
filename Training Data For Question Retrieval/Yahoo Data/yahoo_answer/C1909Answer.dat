FBQZ06vraa	You don't really need the table, since inside the machine the characters are simply numbers in the range 0-254.  All you would have is a table with numbers in it.    But the characters fall into ranges.  A-Z are in one range. a-z are in another. 0-9 are in a third.  Those are the three most important ranges.      So assuming you're doing this for a computer programming project, you can test for individual characters, usually by comparing with, say, 'a' or 'A', or you can examine a character for being in a specific range ('A' to 'Z' or 'a' to 'z').    Further, if you're using C or C++, your compiler may have some predefined functions for such testing.  Look up isalpha() and isdigit().    Hope that helps.|`|IyCnihLmaa	http://asciitable.com/

Prop it up on the back side so that air can move underneath it. Or, get one of those cooling pads to sit it on.    I highly recommend not sitting on the floor with the laptop. Reason is, is that the greatest concentration of dust is less than 3' . So, all you're doing down there is having the laptop suck in that dust into the cooling fan and causing it not to be as effective in cooling the processor.    Perhaps you should try what I do.

It has the explicit right to block, subvert, delete, edit or ban any and all media on its servers.  You have no freedom of speech on Youtube.com's site.

Navigate to the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE/SYSTEM/ CurrentControlSet/Control/Class entry    3. Under the Class entry, double click on {4D36E965-E325-11CE-BFC1-08002BE10318}    4.

HP, Toshiba, Linksys, Dlink and many others have software to use that isn't the microsoft. Those will cause the error if you attempt to use the Microsoft manager. The fix for that is to use the wireless manager supplied for you wireless card and not use the Windows manager.

uxEThASeaa	You have to renew a domain name each year, it's yearly registration.    For hosting I recommend one of these: http://www.hosttell.com/    Powweb is on a 50% sale - $3.88/month ($46.56/year), and you get a free domain from them.    If you already have a domain, add it instead of a new one, and they will initiate the transfer of that domain to their hosting, and renew it for free every year, as long as you host with them. This is how most of the hosts do it.    P.S. I recommend a host which offers Unlimited Domains. (Powweb does) That means that it allows hosting of multiple website on the same account (you have to pay for each additional domain name registration, but you don't have to pay for additional hosting). So for example, if the first site costs you $50, each additional site will cost you just the domain name registration fee (like $10).|`|2LbTrlQnaa	Annual fee but you could get a free domain from Microsoft Office Live (http://hortense-ellis.com is an example) but they ask for your cedit card number for ID purposes|`|NARak4iBaa	You have to re-register the name each year.

With the Mac you are paying significantly more for lower spec hardware.  Why? Because people don't realize that Mac uses a subset of PC hardware...    A number of PCs can also run OS X (Mac OS)  http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&q=os+... as well just that Apple makes it illegal in order to get Market share.. The reason why Mac can run native Windows  is because it is using a subset of PC hardware,    If you decide to buy a Mac for running Windows, you will still have to get the same virus/spyware protection, and run into the same issues as a regular PC.    Now is OS X worth buying a Mac?    I would say no... for the following reasons...    WINDOWS ADVANTAGES:  Aprox 90% of the market is Windows. Most PCs include windows already pre-installed.  1) A number of websites still require Internet Explorer to view and IE for Mac Stinks (it is really ies4osx which is the Windows IE version running really buggy on OS X and illegal if you don't have a legitimate copy of Windows, too many problems with it).  2) More supported peripherals (printers and other things you hook into the computer) on Windows.  3) Many more games  4) Like the Dock on OS X (Mac)? google/yahoo rocketdock, objectdoc.    LINUX ADVANTAGES:  1) Install Linux, and then get tons of software for free.Update software easily and automatically. (Checking a checkbox in either two ways to install (Add/Remove or Synaptic Package Manager), search for something you want, check a box and click apply)  2) Like the Mac OS X effects? go yahoo/google COMPIZ FUSION.

Sample of problems: Overheating Macbooks, OS X- not responding to keyboard, some units with 16bit screens, etc. Apple statistics are misleading since Mac users with problem machines are more likely to go out and buy a new computer than PC users.  Apple is lowering prices which means you can expect lower quality than in the past. Apple had switched the manufacturers producing parts.

Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'.

Sometimes they want you to install the software first and shut down the computer. When you restart it the system will find the drivers and install it by itself.     Sometimes it says to install the card first. Then when you start Windows either it will install it with whatever it has or will ask for the disk.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RTFM|`|fE7zhp3Caa	Some cards will come with instructions to install drivers first, but most of the time you install the card then the drivers.    The best way to do things is to install one card, boot into Windows and install the drivers, reboot if it tells you to, and confirm things are still working normally.  Then install the second card the same way.  The reason you want to do this is because if you install both cards at the same time and get an error of some kind, whether it's the cards themselves or with the driver installation, you'll have to figure out which card is tripping things up.  Installing one card at a time minimized the confusion and generally keeps some hardware/driver conflicts from happening in the first place.|`|ipfWDGtAaa	Generally with Windows XP or Vista, you can just put all the PCI cards in at once.  When you boot up, Windows will attempt to install drivers automatically for all new hardware.

This is the safest way. I know, Advanced users will install the cards first, and then when windows starts, simply hit the 'CANCEL' driver install screens.  THEN, install the CD that came with the devices and restart PC.    Some people make the mistake and forget to hit 'CANCEL' the first time the boot with the new cards installed, and once Windows installs it's own generic driver, it takes more work to replace it with typically more feature rich drivers from the vendor.    You can do either way, but the safest way is to install software first. Last resort: Read the vendors "Quick Start" card that comes in the box! LOL!|`|5AAY41ROaa	Install the card and then let windows find the new hardware, then when the new hardware wizard asks to search online or use CD, tell it to use CD and then insert the CD.    you might try to install one at a time.|`|SzK3zRMSaa	Install the wireless card first.

When you load up Mount and Blade there should be a drop down box that currently says "Native" Click on the arrow and then the name of the mod that you just installed should be there. Select it and then select "Play Mount and Blade"    If you can't open the zipped file download a program called WinRAR:  It's basically free, it will bug you about paying for it, but you don't have to.  http://www.win-rar.com/    One last important thing: Make sure that the mod you download is made for your version of Mount and Blade or else it might not work.

Groups tend to be started by anyone about any topic and allow members to post stuff about the group like Wall posts or pics, etc. Also, when you join a group it shows up as a link on the Info tab of your profile.    About Fans -- you become fans of Pages. Pages are more official than groups -- they tend to be started by official representatives of a celebrity, band, artist, etc. They also tend to be more ornate and have more widgets, pics, etc to interact with Fans of the Page. When you become a Fan of a Page, the Page's icon will show in the Info tab of your profile.    I like Pages when it comes to a person, band, or something like that. I like Groups when they're about random topics. Just depends on your preference!|`|uGI2Ysltaa	There is not much of a difference. Joining a group is to express a thought, feeling, and from people from certain places to unite. Fan pages are more of people, things, games, and events that you like. However, they are very interchangable and these differences that i provided are not really strict.

The PHP needs to pick up all the form parameters, do the calculations and then write out the HTML.

gwNHbrz0aa	The problem is, the best prices are found in local ads and have a week before they expire.  With that being said, your best bet would be to buy a standard computer, and then install an after-market graphics card.    http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    That's a decent desktop and has well over the specs you were looking for.    Side note:  Most graphic cards (including the 7600) require a more powerful power supply than what stock computers come with.  With that being said, it's very possible that you may need to upgrade your PSU (power supply) in order to install a gaming graphics card.  So expect a price of at least $70 for a 350W PSU.  And if you don't install it yourself, a place like Best Buy charges $60 for install of PSU and graphics card.    Even with all that you can keep the price below $600.|`|gYFtQyyQaa	There really isn't a computer that is cheap with that kind of quality.

tXpcpAG3aa	Does the router have any ethernet jacks on it for the outbound signal? if so hook your computer up that way first and setup your router while the laptop is wired to it. Once the router is configured for the wireless connection restart your laptop after unplugging the ethernet cable and then search for your wireless router. It should be there. Also if your system is using Windows XP make sure that you are using WAP or lower security settings on the router. If you use WEP many wireless cards don't play nice on that security setting unless the system is running Vista. I hope that helps.|`|SzK3zRMSaa	You need a wireless router.  It is actually three devices in one - a router, a wireless access point and a switch (multiple outputs).  An access point is just part of the mix.    Most wireless routers come set up from the factory to work right out of the box.  They aren't secure, but the work.    Plug the router into the modem, using the WAN port on the router.    Your comp. should have a balloon in the bottom right of the screen saying 'Wireless networks detected'.  Click on it and pick your signal from the list.  It will be the one with the strongest signal.    If you've messed with the settings, you can do a master reset to factory settings by pressing a little button inside the case with a paper clip.  Look in the docs. for where to find it.      Once you get things working, follow the instructions to set up security in the quick start guide.|`|uDNFHo6faa	well the only thing i can think of is set up the settings on your router (make sure it has a wireless gateway if you want to use wireless internet) while your laptop is hooked up directly to the router turn on you wireless card or whatever and try to find your router|`|24e7ac0e70b1cc3b3f5d6bc8fe0ded91aa	Hey!  It looks to me you are a bit confused about all this network thing.    You can either use a router or an access point. The trick is to know how to plug  the modem to the router or access point so you can get the transmitting signal to the laptop.     I don't know comcast modems  OR how old your modem is but it should have come with an R-J45 cable.  The modem or the access   point should come with a cable RJ45 too,    First you connect the cable that came with the modem to the router "in" then you should make sure everything is on. Then in your laptop you should install the software CD that came with the router and then it would tell you how to access the signal from the router. If you follow the steps you should try it slowly.    Hope this helps my friend.    Take care.|`|0a6f37ff97b71253871297bc4face75aaa	Use an ordinary wireless router (DLink for example) and don't use the usb cables. You need to connect the router to the modem with a cat5 cable, thats an ordinary network cable. The cable should come with the router and it should have a diagram how to set it up. The cat5 cable goes into a specific port on the back of the router, separate from the other four.    Make sure you follow the configuration document that comes with your router for security.

QWKk55oCaa	No. Leaving it in will be fine. Some type of batteries would 'prefer' to be at the peak of their charge all the time. Others need to come all the way down and brought all the way back up. In laptops and cell phones they like to be at "fully charged" versus going all the way down and all the way back up again. It saves the "cycle life" (UP and down) of your battery.     I wouldn't recommend leaving it turned on all the time however. Its a machine like any other thing and the more hours it is left on, the more likely something is to go wrong/ slow down. I cant prove this, but it is how machines work.   I know many people that leave their PC/laptop on all the time and it doesnt seem to be a problem, but they do always seem to run slow after a year or two.|`|4MYWPD9Yaa	If you have your laptop plugged in all the time, you should remove the battery and put it in the refrigerator.

For most laptops, the manual recommends that you have your computer running solely on the battery at least once a month.    Keeping your computer on for 24 hours without breaks can have a negative affect on your computer.  Just like any other electronic, keeping your computer running for more than 24 hours can minimize the life span of your battery and your computer parts.  This means more hassles with replacing laptop parts and battery.

Plug it in exactly where the other ethernet cord was.     Then the usb adapter-   just plug it in your laptop, put in the software it comes with (should give you all the directions you need from there)   and walaah! You have internet.

dc60ff3b5aa807768088e0759e3df6b5aa	Hello,    (ANS) I DON'T want to dent your ego or enthusiasm here but I paid a four digit sum of money and completed my MCSE windows 2000 pro & 2000 advanced server. I completed 30 days offical MS curriculum training with one of the UK's top IT training companies and it was a total waste of time & money, its one of my lifes biggest regrets.    My personal advise is DON'T waste your money or time doing an MCSE study course why? because most employers don't value it and most havent a clue how hard a student works to pass their MS exams. The MS exams are totally ridiculous & utterly nit picking if your answer is not 100% correct its just classed as wrong i.e. no latitude which doesnt mirror real life anyway. The MS exams are just an interlectual mind game, mental gymnastics, students commonly fail these exams because they were tripped up by the wording not because they didn't know the real answer. This is just a nice cash cow for the exam companies & Microsoft.    No.1 YES! of course    No.2 No! depends on the course itself or who you are doing it through.    No.3 No! you get your certification from the course provider who is normally a MS authorized training provider, but it does proove you completed an MCSE.    DONT DO IT !! is my sincerest advise.    Ivan    computer veteran.|`|55c1d74ea3f28f36e0572a05769f11d3aa	If you was my son,  I would sit you down and say Think again MS is not the way to be going these days, You need to be looking well ahead.

BChKHLRXaa	To run any application in command prompt, the command is simply the name of the executable file.  So if the executable for your anti-virus software is "avg.exe", the command is just "avg".  This works for *.exe, *.com, and *.bat files by default in command prompt.    IMPORTANT DETAIL:  Typing the name of an executable file will only run that file if it is located in your current directory!  The exception to this are any directories that are a part of your path variable.      To check your path variable, type "path" at the command prompt and your path variable will be displayed.  This variable holds a list of directories that you want to check for executable files.  Usually your list will look something like this:    C:\Windows\System32;C:\Windows;C:\Wind...    There will typically be more directories that follow.  What this means is that when you type a command, the first thing command prompt will do is check to see if there is an executable in the current directory by that name.  If not, it checks C:\Windows\System32, if it can't find it there, it moves on to C:\Windows, etc. until it has checked all of the directories listed in your path variable.  If the directory of your AVG software is not listed, then you will need to add it.  This can be done in one of two ways:    The first is to change your path variable from the command prompt.  If your software is in the directory "C:\Program Files\AVG" for example, you would type exactly the following at the prompt:    path c:\program files\avg;%path%    Notice the semicolon after my filename? That is how the CP knows where one directory name ends and the next begins.  The "%path%" appends your old path variable to the end of your new one so that you can still access all of the other files you could before.    The problem with this method is that it does not permanently change your path variable, it only alters it for that instance of command prompt.  If you were to close CP and open it again, you would have to reset your path variable once more.    The way to change the path variable permanently is to go to "System" in your Control Panel and click on the button "Advanced Settings..." at the bottom.  From the new window that pops up you should be able to find a button named "Environment variables."    PROCEED WITH CAUTION: Changing any of these variables could seriously alter the performance of windows or other applications, so don't tinker around.      There are two lists of variables displayed, the first one is user variables for your user account, and the second is system variables.  My advice is to not even touch the system variables unless you are sure you know what you are doing.  Search the top list for a variable called "path" if it doesn't exist, create it by clicking "New...".  The name of your new variable should be "PATH" and the value should be whatever folders you want to tack onto the system "path" variable.  Remember that you must use the complete directory name, and separate directories by a semi-colon.    Try it out!  If you have any questions about it, email me.

If yes,  even if the board can handle that type of RAM, the bios settings have to be updated to add the new RAM. If that is the case it will cause the OS not to load correctly because the boot procedure was configured for the old bios settings. Not the new ones. If you continue to have problems take the RAM out and do a restart. Then flash the bios, install the new RAM and try again. If that fails to work you can do a bios update. if you need directions send me an email and I will direct you from there.|`|UTo2Yf3Jaa	Remove the 512mb Ram and leave the 2gb in and reboot to see if that works.  Most RAM coordinates with the motherboard to operate in pairs.|`|eTLG23N4aa	Try starting your computer with the memory it had before the upgrade just to rule it out as the problem. If it works then take out the old memory completely and try the 2 gigs of memory without the 512.
rkuHaiV6aa	Look at the tag on the back. Mine says 1.2A, meaning that is uses 1.2 amps. You have to convert this to Watts by multiplying Voltage by Amps. 1.2 times 110 = 132 Watts.     Electricity useage is measured in Kilowatt hours or KW/H. One Kilowatt hour is a unit of energy equal to the work done by a power of 1000 watts operating for one hour.    A device that uses 132 watts uses 3168 KW/H (132 x 24) in 24 hours. This is the same as 3.168 KW/H.     In 2008 the price of electricity ranged from 6.7 in Idaho to 30 in Hawaii.    So it would cost about 21 in Idaho to about 95 in Hawaii.

AHUhmGTIaa	I build custom desktops and I use AMD processors exclusively. Personally I think the really high end Intel chips are better, but are way too expensive.    I doubt if the average user will notice much difference between an Intel and AMD chip.

If you are looking for just Email, Web Browsing, IM and listen to music its fine.    If you want to do some gaming, Photoshop or other type of applications that require alot Intel is the way to go.     That being said however laptops have not really been made for gaming so AMD for basic use is fine.    My 2C|`|ipfWDGtAaa	AMD processors work just fine.  In fact, AMD made significantly better processors than Intel back in the Pentium 4 days, but now Intel has the upper hand with their Core processors.  But even though Intel processors are a little better these days, AMD processors are still quite good.    I'm using a desktop PC with an AMD Opteron 180 (dual-core 2.4GHz), and it's working great for me.

You get a faster computer at a lower price. That's the main reason many gamers tend to opt for desktop PCs over laptops as they are more suited to gaming and audio/video applications. However, recent developments have meant that there are now laptops coming out that have been primarily designed for gamers. The performance gap is narrowing swiftly.    While laptop prices are falling, they are generally more expensive than PCs because of their design aspect but mainly because they haven't been around as long as PCs. Generally over time, electronic goods such as TVs, DVD players, computers... usually come down in price as makers recoup their initial manufacturing costs.    Another plus point for a PC comes in the fact that they are easily upgradable. If you want to upgrade the graphics card to a more powerful one you can. If you want to change or add another hard drive then go right ahead. With a laptop however, they may require professional installation and in many cases you are unable to upgrade or add to the technology that appears within it. They are a lot more troublesome to deal with when it comes to modifying or repairing them.    Despite these advantages that the PC holds over the laptop hasn't stop the popularity of laptops from growing and expanding. There are in fact now more laptops being brought than desktops and this is a trend that is set to increase.    One of the main advantages that exist with laptops is the fact that they are portable. Many people now need a laptop in order to stay more productive. They allow you to access files and data at anytime and from any location, which is a necessity for many people due to our fast paced and on the go society. Also thanks to Wi-Fi wireless networks the connectivity of laptops are amazing. You are able to gain easy access to the Internet while you remain mobile.    Another pro to having a laptop as your next computer as oppose to a desktop PC is the fact that with a laptop you have low power consumption. The reason for this is that laptops are several times more power-efficient than desktops. A typical laptop uses 20-90 W, compared to 100-800 W for desktops. I feel that this is an important feature, especially for businesses that run hundreds of personal computers as it could ensure that you have a multitude of potential savings. It is also helpful to homes where there is a computer running 24/7 such as a home media server or print server.    Nor should you ignore the aesthetic appeal of the laptop. They have great style and design which makes them attractive to potential buyers. Gaming laptops are especially decked out with flashy decor and pizazz; while you should never buy a computer for its looks, many people do just that!    These are just a few examples of the pros and cons that are associated with laptops and desktop PCs. There are good and bad points for each option, so depending on what you need your computer for you may opt for a laptop or you may opt for a PC. The most important thing is that you make your choice based on your needs to ensure that you get the most out of your computer. Satisfy your own needs first and you won't be disappointed with your final choice.|`|m2mny87jaa	if you build the pc yourself, they will probably come out roughly the same. i guess it depends on what you say is high end.|`|aZnAHgJSaa	High end PC would be my choice    The actual hardware is much cheaper    Not only that, it is easier to upgrade as well    Not to mention that an uber laptop will usually be too much to carry around because of weight, be so demanding in its power consumption that it will not only consume a lot of battery life, but also produce a lot of heat as well.    Mind you, you will need to purchase an external monitor for a desktop    But it will likely be larger in size than a laptop's LCD would be - not to mention that you have more choice (i.e. if you want one with a better contrast ratio - you have that option, whereas on a laptop you wouldn't)    Expansion is very important on a gaming computer - not just any laptop can do sound, video, and input upgrades.

f79a44bda7e4581623ca3e13cb6ad153aa	The first error that I see is that your brackets don't match. That won't compile.  // It would look better like this  while ( !(argv[counter]==NULL))    One reason not to do this is because you assume that a missing parameter is null. there is no such guarantee. There could be anything there if you go past the argc count.    The proper way to do it is using the argument count found in argc. Also I'm not sure why you are incrementing the counter by 2. Do you really want to skip every other argument?    I'd start the loop with  int i;  for (i=o;i  ...do stuff with argv[i]  }|`|YO1GBm6Paa	Compare w/ argc, what you have there looks like it will try to loop past the end of argv.  Also note that argv is declared as: char *argv[].  So unless you have options followed by parameters skipping two will give you problems.|`|bAUO9Yhdaa	That code doesn't work in C because unlike a character string argv is not NULL terminated. You'll need to use a for loop that relies on argc. The code below should work. Since this is C I'll use pointer arithmetic. Anyone who wants to truly understand C should have a good understanding of pointers and pointer arithmetic, so this is the perfect place to start.    argv += 2; // Get past the executable name and first odd argument.  for (int i=2; i   ...Do stuff...  argv += 2; // advance pointer to next even string  }    To get the current string that you're working on in argv use the dereference operator (*argv) instead of an index (argv[i]). If you just use argv without the dereference operator then you will get a type error.  If you need to use argv more than once then assign argv to another char*[] variable and use that instead.    char *[] current_arg = argv;  current_arg += 2;    And so on.    Cheers!|`|MZ1DRSflaa	Odd number of brackets.  Add 1 bracket after NULL.  =  argc is an int, *argv is an array of pointers  =  CORRECTED LOOP  while ( !(argc[counter]==NULL)){  .....do stuff  counter+=2;  }

4yhGXh8kaa	There's no such thing as a MD of disk space. and I don't think its one Mb so it's probably one Gigabyte.    Think of your Hard Drive like a storage locker with all the files and programs on it that you use, everything that stays when you turn your comp off. The space on it is measured using a variation of metric measurements of Bytes. For you than means its measured in Mb (Megabytes) and Gb (Gigabytes) There's 1024 Mb in a Gb, so for your purposes just think a thousand.    Currently There is no free space on your hard drive (the storage locker, generally called C:, D: or Local Disk or My Hard Drive or something like that, the icon for it resembles the internal part and it looks like a metallic looks like a metallic rectangular thingy.    Browse your computer in the searchlight and by opening the HDD (Hard drive), you can right click on a file/object or a folder/container and select (I can't remember for sure on a Mac) properties or something and view various statistics and info about the file or folder. Do the same on the HDD to see how much free space is in it.    You should see a size measured in some variation of bytes. If you don't know the metric system this is gonna be difficult, open it up on the Wikipedia, otherwise apply it to the bytes to know how big something is.     The goal is to delete enough stuff to make room for Sims 2. Do not go deleting stuff if you don't know what it is. You can remove programs by uninstalling them.     depending on your Mac your HDD should have somewhere between 20-60Gbs if its like 14 years old and more like 120gbs and 400gbs if you bought it in the past 6 years or so    Video files (like those TV shows you downloaded for example) are huge and can take up very large amounts of space. Lnger videos tend to be larger but higher quality videos are much larger. DVD quality and length videos are aproximatly 4-8 Gb each. Other Videos will be between 800Mb (0.8Gb) and 60 Mb (0,06Gb).     pictures are generaly to small to matter even in large numberes, music files are usualy closer to 2-6Mb which can add up when you have over a thousand songs    Some game programs can take up a lot of space World of Warcraft is around 20Gbs. Other programs are extremely small.

When you print on white paper, anything that is white in the picture will be left blank on the paper and thus is white, no ink is applied in white areas. I am currently not aware of any white ink cartridges available for printers as there is probably not a significant market for them to make it profitable. When you print any pictures that require color the printer mixes the existing colors together to obtain the various other colors and shades that are required other than white. <br>  <br>  Hope that explains it well enough.

d15c62252eefd95880b4ef477f538dc6aa	I really don't understand your configuration as you have stated it. But I can offer some information. Your computer has a 100mbs card, which means it is capable of 100 megabits/seconds. Somewhere along the way is a data path that goes to the Internet.  I don't know from your post what that is, but roughly the slowest link in the chain will determine the overall speed. This is likely to be your DSL link.  In any event, you can measure your overall speed at various web sites that run java in your browser. So, just point your browser over to one of these, and get a measurement. Try http://www.internetfrog.com.|`|aqJhF71Raa	Your network connection to your router is probably *not* the bottleneck here. Most DSL speeds don't exceed 10mbps, and certainly not 100mbps. Getting a faster router would only improve local area connections (not internet) between any computers connected to your home network.    If you want to get an idea of your connection speed, try a website like www.speedtest.net.

It was lost forever.|`|xnK1roCRaa	unless u can get on the email  i dont think there is anyway you can get it back  soo hmm  just make a new one?
YCPgsvV9aa	OK first off that game is amazing. And second off read this Q.U.I.C.K becuas Yahoo's probably going to delete it.    First off, the 18w game is for sure to work (works on my Vista) but the thing is there may be not enough 'seeders'. Seeders are people who download that torrent, and provide a backup host incase the first host doesnt work. In simple case, if the torrent your trying to download cant connect to the orrigianal person who posted it, then it'll go to the next seeder, and the next exc....    If there's only one seeder, chances are it isnt going to download. You can try FrostWire and search it using the Programs option when you boot up, its basicly a Torrent heaven! Just dont download the files with really low KB becuase its probably a virus. Download something around or over 100mb, becuase that's the average for that game. And also download the one with the highest number (little number twoards the left side of the name)|`|PaNtuw4Daa	actualllllyyyy  this is something you wouldnt want to bring onto yahoo answers  use utorrent  probably your connection sux?  uhm  i think u have to save it  then open the torrent with utorrent  or something  idunnooooo  it says on piratebay

But do you really want to spend a lot of money in this  bad ecomomy?    Good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"    For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products?)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here. Saving cash these days is important!    Avoid the anti-virus called AVG (free version). It is wildly popular with children and the computer illiterate but has historically had the lowest virus detection rate of all the popular free anti-virus programs.|`|q6kvVkNPaa	don't use spyware that is the type of program that WILL give you virus' and ruin your computer|`|X05mP4aBaa	if u r in problum mean u r problum is spyware virous u cheak this site nowhttp://meshigk.com/security/spyware-guar...

Reboot and enter the iTunes by right clicking and "open". If you have Vista then try "Open as Administrator". If that doesnt work im really not sure what to tell you.    iTunes isnt that well defined. It has errors doing the coding on tracks when you sync enough, and this may be another. A huge effect is also if your running it on a Windows, instead of a Mac. The codding seems to vary a little, and you may have activated something that cant be read, now it doesnt want to open it.
zorYTX59aa	YOU DON'T NEED ANY DOWNLOADERS OR CONVERTERS. SOME PEOPLE ON   YAHOO! ARE ACTUALLY DISGUISED SALESPEOPLE TRYING TO 'SUCKER' YOU   INTO BUYING THEIR BOGUS AND UNNECESSARY SOFTWARE.    If youre using Windows Movie Maker, there is  the possibility that you mistakenly saved your   video as an "MSWMM" file with "Save Project"  rather than save it as an "AVI" or "WMV" with   "Save Movie File" (Win XP) or "Publish Movie"   (Vista).    There is a world of difference between the first   example and the others: not only is MSWMM   considered a "work-in-progress", it is not even   a "true" video. The other 2 examples are what  you need to properly save your file and upload  it to YouTube.    The best way to save and upload your video is:    1 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks" menu)    2 -- click "Finish Movie", the 3rd option.....(it will expand to 5 choices)    3 -- click "Save to my Computer".....(the "Save Movie" wizard appears)    4 -- enter the name of your movie.....(it is best to stay in "My Videos")    5 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you'll see the "Movie Setting" page)    6a -- for regular video, click "Best quality for playback".....(the default)  6b -- for 16:9, click "Compress to" and tweak it until you see 640x360    7 -- click "Next" at the bottom.....(you will get the "Completing" page)    8 -- click "Finish" at the bottom.....(the saving may take quite a while)    9 -- click the blue "Tasks" icon again.....(you'll get the "Movie Tasks")    A -- click "Finish Movie" again, the 3rd option.....(you'll get 5 choices)    B -- this time, click "Send to the Web".....(I'm sure you know the rest)    YouTube suggests that the video format be  MPEG4 at 480x360 recorded together with   sound in MP3 audio, all at a rate of greater   than 24 frames per second. Other files that  are accepted include AVI, MPG, MOV and   WMV (which is Windows Movie Maker).

Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???
YCPgsvV9aa	Mmk, first off im warning you before you do this. I have M.E.G.A studio quality speakers, REAL concert speakers that ive channeled through to a switch box, that can play from my computer and I personally DO NOT recommend this.    You can open a program I use for mixing, called Mixx (go figure) and you can play the song via the library and just increase the gain. Though it will get fuzzy becuase it is going farther than supposed to.    Or you could download this other program I found on the internet, witch also has a gain switch. Its more complicated though.|`|7ZfGqo3qaa	If you've already maxed the volume in your playback program and Windows master volume, then you need amplified speakers with their own physical volume knob.|`|R1c4Oq7uaa	Often times there are many different sound controls on a computer, if you are running windows you can DOUBLE click on the sound icon in the system tray (bottom right corner) and it will open the full volume control and not just the master system volume control.  If the sound icon isnt there you can find sounds in the control panel and then click advanced to get to the same spot.  the audio out is usually done through WAVE as well as master volume and it is usually set to less than max.  beyond that whatever program you are using likely has volume control also.  finally if you have POWERFUL speakers than chances are they also have some volume control on them, but thats a bit easier to find and my guess is if you havent found that yet then it may not exist.

aqJhF71Raa	I'll explain it in base 10 (decimal) first so that base 16 (hex) makes more sense.    If you were asked to add 57 + 68 in decimal, you would say 125. You would get this by adding the ones places, carrying over anything above 10, then adding the tens places, again carrying over anything above 10 until you finished adding.    In the ones place, you have 7 + 8 = 15. Since 15 is greater than 9 but the ones place can only hold a value from 0-9, subtract 10 from the result and you have 5 left over in the ones place. Since you took 10 away from the ones place, you need to carry that over to the tens place.    In the tens place you have 5+6 = 11, PLUS the 1 you carried over = 12. Again, you have a number greater than 9 so subtract 10 and carry over a 1 to the next place.    In the hundreds place, you have 0+0 = 0 (if there is no number there just place a 0), plus the 1 you carried over = 1.    Therefore, the final answer is 125.        In hex, it is identical except instead of the numbers going from 0-9, they go from 0-F.   0 hex = 0 decimal  1 hex = 1 decimal  ...  9 hex = 9 decimal  A hex = 10 decimal  ...  F hex = 15 decimal    For the problem you gave: 7B+12F  In the "ones" place, you have B + F. Converting that to decimal, you have 11 + 15 = 26. Remember that this is base 16, so since we can only represent numbers from 0-15 (0-F), subtract 16 from the result and carry a 1 over to the next place. This leaves us with 10 in the ones place, or A.    In the "sixteens" place (remember base 16) you have 2+7 = 9, plus the one you carried over = 10, or A in hex. Since this is less than 16, we don't need to do any carrying over.    In the "256ths place" (16*16), you have 0+1 = 1. Again, no need to carry anything over.    The final answer is 1AA.|`|ja1NsNL1aa	Add as you would in decimal, starting from the right: B + F = 1A, or A, carry 1:    ? ?? 1  ? ?7 B   1 2 F   --------  ???? A    The other column additions do not involve a carry\;  ?? 7 B  1 2 F  -------  1 A A    In decimal this is (evaluating from the right, multiplying each hex digit by its place value)    1*A + 16*A + 256* 1  = 10 + 160 + 256  = 426|`|IyCnihLmaa	first post the answer so we really know you know the answer and are not just looking for the solution to your homework.|`|zjuRv62eaa	Well I added B and F. I turned B into 2 and F into 6. Since the number is over 5 (F) I got the difference between the two. So since 2 + 6 is more than 5 it comes out to B. So far the answer is xB where x is a variable. Oh and since that 2 + 6 problem is over 5 I had to carry over 1. Now I do 7 + 12 + 1(the number I had to carry over). The answer I got was 411.  Maybe I sounded too confusing.

DSa6xvqOaa	you need to be more SPECIFIC on wat you mean by registration since a drive doesnt need to be registered.    usually a cd drive is  PLUG AND PLAY. meaning you plug it to ur computer n it works after you restart pc.     sometimes you may have to go on manufacturers website to downlaod driveer or do a WINDOWS UPDATE through microsofts website.    if by registration you are referring to a burning program to MAKE music cds or dvds then, i would recommend you to go on demonoid.com n download nero burning software.   you can get serials for it there so you can use it for free    was ur drive capable of ripping in the past?    because not all drives can READ AND WRITE. maybe ur drive doesnt have the ability to rip. and u cant just download a driver for it to have the ability to rip, especially if it doesnt have da feature to rip.

vL2Ec50Yaa	Mod and MOI are file formats used by JVC, Sony, and probably other camcorders mfrs. You can play these files using the free download of WinAmp 5.541 which can be downloaded here:    http://www.winamp.com/player|`|brx6G2iaaa	Cyberlink power producer will work. However, its not a free software.|`|R1c4Oq7uaa	If you go to the JVC website there is probably a program that either plays those files or works directly with your camera and converts them into .mov files or mpeg4s or whatever common video file format you choose.  You can go to the website and do a product search under your camcorders name and see if there is any support software.  I also notice that the website offers some tutorials for its products, you may find something there.|`|kK9tLKhHaa	It is not the MOI that contains the video, it is the MOD file. After transferring the MOD file to your PC, rename it so that it will have an extension of .MPG. MOD is actually an MPEG2 file. If you still cannot play it, you will have to install a code. I recommend using FFDSHOW.

UpW1EG7Maa	You are sharing that internet with every other person in that block/building/dorm room. The problem is not your wall jack its the fact that a number of people at any given  in your dorm is trying to access the internet using dial up speeds. So the bottleneck what be at the edge near the router.    If your school uses dial up then there is not much you can do to change that. (Maybe the students can petition for a faster network??? it might just work)    Like someone said ethernet is like a water pipe, so if you are only person using the pipe then your water would come at a faster rate than if 30 people were trying to get water at the same time.    That is some low bandwidth to use. You just have to make due.|`|hXHBm1BSaa	No. This might even cause the connection to die. A switch can only connect one machine to one port at a time. And the network ports will not be the reason for a slow connection, they are the fastest part of the connection  by a factor of about 100.|`|YO1GBm6Paa	No, the bandwidth is limited upstream, and you cannot add them.|`|AA10044636	Absolutely not. Ethernet isn't like a water pipe. Having water running through two pipes does mean you end up with more water in your bucket. However, this is not the case. Try contacting your network administrator or some collegues.

Socket 775 motherboards, the pins are on the motherboard. The processor is 'keyed' meaning there are indents(holes) on two sides of the processor. The holes line up to the socket in only one way. The socket should be bigger than the processor. Once you lean up the holes just lay down the metal pressure tab on top of the processor, then use the arm to complete the pressure coming down on that metal plate. Put some thermal compound on what is exposed, then put your heat sink on.

Ill list a few reason as to why you might be getting is. Im guessing your using Vista as well.<br>  <br>  -The operating system may have some currupted files and need to be reinstalled.<br>  -The current drivers (drivers are software that tells your computer how to interact with the hardware) installed could be incompatable with vista or there might be updates available that might fix the issue.<br>  -Hardware is malfunctioning which could include Hard drive,RAM or video card. Bad RAM is a common cause of this.<br>  -Take out all your devices that plug into the computer and see if the issue still occurs. If it does not occur then one of your devices is not compatible with your windows operating system and call the manufacturer and see if they have a fix.<br>  - A program you have installed may be incompatible with vista. Check the version numbers of you all your installed software and see if there any know issues on google with vista.<br>  <br>  There is def. a lot more reasons as to why this is happening but without the actually error description theres no sure way of knowing.

0fCxkr41aa	OK -  without knowing what the manufacturer and the model number of your is, I cannot give you detailed step by step directions.  But here are the basics    Go to the website for the manufacturer of your router. Go to the support page. Follow the prompts and download the manual for the router    In the manual yo will find directions as to how to use your browser to access your router.  Make sure you are using a cable - not a wireless connection for this setup  Typically you enter 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1 in the address bar on your browser  When you contact the router a pop up will ask you for the user name and password  Typically they are admin/"blank", admin/admin or admin/password  You manual will give you the exact ones    Now go to the wireless section of the router  Change the name of your router (the SSID) to a unique name  select WPA security  Enter a pass phrase - make it a hard one like tdWV$$l(b%:' - just be sure to write it down  save your settings  Now disconnect the cable and try to connect wirelessly  you will be asked for the password  once you enter it you should be connected  Make sure your router is at the top of the network list and is set to connect automatically  Now go back to the router setup page and select "hide SSID"   save your settings  Now change the user name and password for your router. Write them down  Save your settings  Now you are secure|`|gAxh6rMpaa	Why don't you password protect it?|`|aqJhF71Raa	Your router should come with a user manual which explains how to secure it.

Update 2: For SMC routers, try the following 3 links (in order). THe first is how to log in to the router, the second is the default passwords, and the third is how to secure the router.  http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=promo...  http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=promo...  http://www.smc.com/index.cfm?event=promo...|`|eg9wjUQ7aa	I recently moved from an apartment where we got internet from an unknown location.

O2xrHTVGaa	The processor is okay for levelling and partying but you will get lags in a large raid or when there's a screen full of people. A 3GHz processor is recommended as a minimum for all round enjoyment.    Memory no problem at all.    Video card is the main problem here. WoW is much more complex than what it was before so a dedicated video card (as opposed to an integrated card, what you have here) is a must unless you wish to play at bare minimum settings with low resolution which I find isn't worth the monthly fees. Even then you will experience stuttering in the graphics when you move from place to place as new graphic textures and lightning are constantly being loaded and drawn. Not the again mention when you are in 10+ man raids you will experience extremely low frame rates. Ask any WoWer to tell you about "lag city" aka Dalaran or Battle of Wintergrasp where only you get video lags but also network lags due to the amount of activity there. Up to 100+ players on the same screen discoing under the aoe spells isn't uncommon!    Final word, bad experience if you're planning to use an integrated video card for WoW. You will be fine until you get to the current expansion contents: Wrath of the Lich King.|`|6HIrPMjOaa	Lol 6 series isnt that good or bad its in the middle ihave 8 series and your procssor is better than mine i think i have 2 gb ram too  yes you should be able to run Wow at least its not an FPS game..|`|mG9utjCKaa	i think your computer can run WoW. but to be on the safe side go to this website:     systemrequirementslab.com    you will need directx 9.0c to play or you will have to download it some how. i can't play on my computer because of the directx 9.0c.    so use that website and see if your computer can handle WoW.     and OH YEA HAVE FUN|`|IXJppiRSaa	yes your computer will play but it wont be the best experience your ram will be more then enough to run wow not sure about your framerate if i wads you i would buy another cpu

2LbTrlQnaa	Copyright is a legal entity.  A creator of something whether a book, song, movie or TV show is entitled to protect his creation.  If YouTube allow copyright infringements, they will get sued themselves and possibly shut down.  Same applies to MySpace.  I don't understand why today's youngsters simply don't get copyright.  You ignore copyright, you gonna get sued somewhere along the line.  Record labels, movie studios and TV networks are deadly serious about this.|`|GutYNu9baa	They are just becoming more responsible, A lot of people who own the the copyrights are loosing out.

5fkqsnBJaa	Avoid  AVG (free version). It is wildly popular with children and the computer illiterate but has historically had the lowest virus detection rate of all the popular free anti-virus programs.    Good security can be had for free, its just not in a neat all-in-one "security suite"    For good computer security and to prevent virus you need to do a minimum of 4 things.    1. Run a firewall.    2. Use a good anti-virus with real-time protection.    3. Do a regular scan with a dedicated anti-spyware,    4. Keep Windows and all your other installed software, 100% updated and patched with all important and security updates.  ______________________________________...    My recommendations:    1. For the typical home user of XP or Vista, Windows Firewall is adequate, even more so if one is using a router, which is a very good firewall in itself. Make sure your Windows Firewall is turned "on".    2. For your Anti-Virus......(Always use only 1 A-V...You must NEVER use more than one anti-virus, Even an expired anti-virus can cause a major conflict...did I mention that you MUST uninstall any and all, old anti-virus products...both Norton and AVG must go!)    I would suggest Avast, the newest version 4.8. Avast now includes anti-virus, some anti-spyware capability and anti-rootkit components. And all for the low low price of free. You can get it here:  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    3.  For your Anti-Adware and Anti-Spyware needs...  SUPERAntiSpyware:  http://www.superantispyware.com/    They have a free version.    4. Use Secunia PSI to insure that all your software is kept always updated and patched against vulnerabilities that are often exploited to compromise computers. Very important.     http://secunia.com/vulnerability_scannin...    Its free as is everything else here|`|uuDloQnCaa	Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.    What AVG does not do: http://free.avg.com/download-avg-anti-vi...|`|aGNjZmyJaa	AVG has one of the worst detection rates there is. I don't know why people on here even recommend it.    Get PC Tools Internet Security, Comodo Internet Security, or Avira.|`|Few4ggFXaa	Yeah it is really good. I have used it for many years old my last laptop and all other computers i have had. It alerts me when there is an infection or a threat. I am still using it right now. It's really good!!!!|`|wjEPVNezaa	AVG is pretty good, but most people move on from that to either avast! or avira antivir.  All three are good, and better than Norton and McAfee.  If you're willing to pay for AV, I'd recommend Kaspersky.  Nod32 takes up less resources, and is better than the any of the free versions out there, but Kaspersky is gold.    Since you're careful and not a numbnut online, you can stick to either of the top three free AVs.  Also use a good spyware scanner, such as malwarebytes, superantispyware, or a-squared free.  All free and good.|`|YVE64dJUaa	AVG free version is not enough protection i use avast    http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...    why?    http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    avast is the best free anti virus out there PERIOD it gives you all you need for nothing, install free, no nagging pop ups to buy a 'full' version, register for 14 months free than just re register free, active monitoring means that scans aren't needed as often    i use it and it is GREAT    i had norton internet security and am very disappointed in them :(  had avg free version it found a virus that norton didn't (so much for paying for service)  i now use avast it found loads of things avg had let through    use avast and never look back again    you only need ONE anti virus don't install more than one as they can conflict with each other and result in no protection

2SSA9e9Naa	First, you don't want to be looking for speaker software, you have to start with your audio card.    Can you tell us what type of audio card you have in your system?    Second, did you check your audio drivers in Device Manager? Go to Control Panel | Device Manager. In there look at the Sound, Audio, and Game Controllers to see if there is a yellow icon at the driver. If there is open and see if you can get the driver update.    Finally, check your audio settings. Control Panel audio & sound to see if things are just turned off.    Update your question with anything you find.|`|rSqSxIyOaa	You may have lost the software for your soundcard.  Happened to me once and I had to go online and get a tech from HP to send me an e-mail with a site that I could download the software online for it.|`|ZewrmH4saa	Do you have them plug up right.   And can them speakers run on your computer.|`|eyeMCZotaa	try these: right click on your my computer, then click properties, then click on the hardware tab, next click on the device manager, if you see a small question mark(with !) icon under the sound, video and game controllers. it means that it is not installed. u need to update it, right click on it and click on update driver.     If it doesn't work try these go on your control panel click on the sound and audio devices, try setting it with your own configuration.|`|Cddqq9dBaa	If your speakers have a power cord, make sure it's plugged in. I'm sure you already knew that.     Ok, left click START, select CONTROL PANEL, then select SOUNDS, SPEECH, AND AUDIO DEVICES then select SOUND AND AUDIO DEVICES.    Make sure MUTE isn't checked and look at the other settings.  Hope this helps if not it may be an issue with your sound card.    To check that do this.    Left click Start, select CONTROL PANEL, then PERFORMANCE AND MAINTENANCE, then SYSTEM, then select HARDWARE, then select  DEVICE MANAGER, then you should see SOUND, VIDEO AND GAME CONTROLLERS with a + in a box next to it. Fist off, if there is a yellow question mark next to it there is a problem with your sound card, click the box then the driver and try to repair it.     If there isn't a yellow question mark then your sound card is working fine and it is a problem with your speakers or volume. Hope this helps.    If I had more info I could probably be more help. It is probable something very simple. Try to plug some head phones into the jack where your speakers plug into to see if they work.

wjEPVNezaa	It's pretty convenient to have links indicate which sites you've visited.  If you hate it that much, you can prevent this via two ways:    1.  Adjust the font color in your browser by making the visited links the same color as active links.  You can do this by typing in your address bar about:config, and then search for color.  Look at the visited link color or some similar name to change the color.    2.  Go to userstyles.org and pick a color style that you like.  You can adjust the color by editing the style so that the color appears the same as a regular link.    FYI: the color appears in hex, so the  FFF000 are one color.  You can find the color pretty easily by typing it into a search box and seeing what pops up.|`|Ardz6306aa	There's no way, I don't think so.

dIxQ9rV5aa	I'm not sure what a search bar is, but when I see a Taskbar disappear, I do Ctrl+Alt+Del on the keyboard, choose Applications, click New Task, and type:    explorer    and click OK.|`|abE2ZzaWaa	I asked the guys in weseekit.com and they told me the first solution you should try is to reset your computer. If that doesn't work, try right clicking on your desktop, choose properties, then appearence and try changing the theme.    It's pretty hard to answer that question though, as I'm not pretty sure if what I imagined is what is happening to you, I don't know what operating system you have, etc.    Hope I helped.

rkuHaiV6aa	You only have a 50Gig hard drive!     50G is ok for XP, but not if you're going to be doing anything substantial with it. Buy your self a bigger drive. They usually come with a utility to copy it over. You could then keep the 50G drive as a D drive and move your My Documents and keep your data there (makes it easy to back that up).    You can get a 500G 750G drive for under $100. Go for a Seagate as they have a 3 year warranty.|`|DSa6xvqOaa	ur harddive is wayyy to small. you can get  a external hardrive from walmart or bestbuy- any electronic retail store for a cheap price.     and make sure u delete files properly especially programs.    for the time being downlaod ccleaner from here   http://www.ccleaner.com/    im pretty sure you can downlaod it since its  a small file, and install it n run it. it will clean out some of ur junk n give you a little more space|`|Gm1Hmjj5aa	Get another hard drive as extra space and save that one for programs and the operating system. If you download a big number of files or just big files with a program, install it  regularly but set the download folder to the new hard drive. If it's just old stuff you have, delete or burn on blank dvd-rs to free up the space if you've got a burner. Sometimes, old hard drives appear to be using more space than they really are, for this reason sometimes you even need to format the drive to show its real size, do that if you've got restore discs or the OS disc with a valid serial, but first save or burn the stuff you don't want to lose that's already on the hard drive.|`|tXpcpAG3aa	If you have a lot of programs you use, you may want to get a larger Hard Drive. But if it is just the usual that I see happen where you just accumulate a bunch of stuff that you don't use, run disk clean up first. It is in you accessories folder. Then run Disk Defragmenter. After that look to see how much space you have left. If it is still almost full like the pic shows. Your next step is to go through your list of programs in the add remove programs option. Get rid of anything you know you don't use. If after that the disk is still showing it is full, you may want to run a good anti-virus program and hope that you don't have a virus that has taken over. If not I can recommend a company that is very reasonable to get it fixed the right way for you. You can email them at jdptechnology@yahoo.com.       Half the time though the problem is that we just accumulate a lot of programs that we don't use anymore, and we need to do a little bit of cleaning to get things back on track. Hope that helps.|`|2LbTrlQnaa	You have a very small Hard Drive and you have a bunch of things Games and Torrents that take up a load of space.  Either you need to buy and install a bigger Hard Drive or buy an External Hard Drive to store some of your things and free up space on your computer|`|hXHBm1BSaa	You have masses of extra programs on it, look at the folder list!

If you don't know where they are or what they are, do a Search for files on C: drive, and in options, click 'What size is it?' and select the option 'Specify Size' and enter 50000.    This will return a list of files over about 50 Mb.  Select View, Details from the menu, and you will see where they are.      You could search for 100000 (100 Mb) files or larger if you like.

FuGD0C5uaa	It sounds like your mouse buttons or your keyboard buttons are getting pushed down and causing your computer to display the screen in expose mode, which just opens up all of the things on the window so you can select a screen. I recommend trying a different mouse and if that doesn't work try a new keyboard. Let apple know whats going on with this as well; they will be extremely cooperative.
5fkqsnBJaa	Leave those 2 kissfm entries there in your HOSTS file but add them both again with "www." in front of them (without the " ").    Or you could add them to the IE Restricted  SECURITY (not Privacy) Zone, which may cripple that site enough so the media won't stream.   Restricting using the privacy tab, only restricts the use of cookies...not enough.    Better yet, Open DNS has an Radio (streaming media) blocking option:  http://www.opendns.com/features/adult/  that will block most ALL radio stations.    Your computers will likely run a bit faster as well when you use the Open DNS.com's DNS server instead of your provider's (ISP) default one.    Free at:  http://www.opendns.com/    Good luck.    ****************EDIT*****************    You DO need to reboot the computer after you modifiy the HOSTS file...otherwise the computer will bring up an old cached copy of it.    *****************EDIT2***************    OpenDNS will likly block Pandora on the computer that she uses, I am not sure if it will block Pandora on the entire company network...depends on the configuration.

If they say there is a problem with your computer,  demand they send out a technician to check their incoming speeds free of charge.    By the way, WEP provides zero protection and can be cracked by a novice in under 10 minutes.  WPA or WPA-2 maybe?

uuDloQnCaa	Avast home edition is free and effective, it protects your PC from infected webpages, scans your downloads and emails for viruses (AVG free does neither) and has built in anti-rootkit and anti-spyware, plus it gives you the option to run a boot scan, there are very few anti-virus's that can do this paid or otherwise and this is free.    Avast works for 60 days from installation after which you will need to register to get your free product key which is valid for a year after which you get another free key, so it always free.    I use Avast along side Comodo firewall both are free, light on memory and have been independently tested and proven to be more effective then Norton or Mcafee.    Avast: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...  Comodo: http://www.personalfirewall.comodo.com/    Why Avast is better then AVG:    On AVGs official website it states that their free anti-virus software does not protect you from poison webpages or scan downloads and emails for viruses (Avast free edition does all 3), I've also tested both AVG and Avast using the EICAR test viruses, AVG allowed all the viruses onto the computer without a single warning Avast either blocked them instantly or shorty after preventing all from running, Avast is much lighter and offers far superior protection.

You need to practice good strategies to prevent yourself from getting viruses, along with having a good firewall. The default Windows firewall is fine.    If you were to get a virus, I suggest Malwarebytes, Spyware Doctor, or SUPERantispyware. Or a combination of them. Spyware Doctor is the most powerful, but will bog down your system.

I wouldn't go with Norton Anti-Virus, considering the program itself got infected and killed my last computer. The best I've found so far are Avast!, since it's constantly running the second you turn your computer on, and AVG, because it scans all incoming e-mails and data-transfers. Avast!, however, only offers free TRIAL versions. You can, if you want, just re-install whenever your 90-day trial runs out, there's nothing stopping you from doing that, but if you have the money to shell out for it, I would recommend buying it. AVG, however, is free, from what I remember. Hope it helps ^^    (by the way, Avast! has a massive database that gets up-dated weekly, so you don't get bombarded with new viruses out of nowhere) =]

It seems kind of like a stalker alert because it makes you put you last name. I think it is harder to figure out, and has a lot of useless features.    MySpace if you are looking to talk to people you know, and meet new people. You can customize your profile to show people who you really are. Its also a great way to find new music and communicate easily.    Both are great ways of communication, but I personally like MySpace.|`|iH9qcVLgaa	facebook
vLJTz6zbaa	bootnuke and change passwords|`|AoLS7XXTaa	Some times people can hack your phone, by downloading other peoples phone numbers off of your phone..    The only way for some one to monitor you on your computer  by downloading a program like Windows live Security for parents. If you go to a site, its put on a list and your parents (or who ever)...  You sometimes have to enter a pass word to view the list. It sometimes blocks the entered site if its inappropriate. then you must send an email to your parents to approve the site...    So they can see what you do, just after you do it i guess....  My mom downloaded the program onto my laptop, and it works...

AA10007676	Actually, if you want only a basic site you can do it your self, it may not take that much time, but you may be willing to learn few things which are not that much complicated, like some basic html, uploading the sites etc. Now a days there are lot of freely available web templates which you can download and modify the contents to create the web pages of your site.     For a website, you need a  domain name which you can register from any of the authorized registrars and an hosting to upload the files. You can find the details of each step of creating a basic site here http://www.shaplus.com/guide/website/how...    $500 is ok for a large site with lot of details but too much for a basic site with few pages.|`|d171cb3d2617bac19b52223283eb5072aa	It can be time consuming, but there are free html editors out there that make it a lot easier.

wiJz0FYLaa	Assuming you have no hardware issues, do this:    (1) Run a FULL anti-virus scan with a good virus scanner. Get free editions of AVast or AVG8. Use the latest virus definitions file. But don't run/install more than one anti-virus at the same time.    (2) Run anti-spyware scans with Spybot S&D and malwarebytes.    (3) Ensure all Microsoft security updates are applied.    (4) Run disk cleanup to delete old temp files and other junk    (5a) Run chkdsk once to scan for file system errors. http://support.microsoft.com/kb/315265    (5b) Run  a thorough disk defrag. Use a good defragmenter for this, and also run a boot-time defrag to fix the MFT and page file if they are fragmented. You can check out Diskeeper 2009, which is widely acknowledged to be the best defragger around. Their website has free 30-day trial versions. http://www.diskeeper.com    (6) Disable unnecessary background processes and services that take up memory.    (7) Make sure all the hardware components have the latest and most stable drivers. Video card performance in particular is strongly dependent on drivers.

dd7a6b1296760b08bd746b164b6c8787aa	Outsourcing means hiring someone to do a job for them. Most of these outsourcing companies are call centers. But not all. Some are IT companies who are being hired to create certain programs or websites. So a company pays the outsource people to provide service to their customers.    Lets say a computer company (Dell for instance). Dell pays this Call   Center in India to provide TechSupport to it's US consuments. This Call Center hires and trains people based on Dell's policy. The Call Center provides salary to these agents but these agents represents Dell on a call. They don't say "I work for this Call Center" to their customers. Instead, one would say "I work for Dell" though Dell is not paying him/her directly.     Most big companies use outsourcing because it's cheaper. If Dell uses Americans, they would have to pay them more (almost 3x 5x 10x more) vs Asians where labor is very cheap. The disavantage is most of these outsource companies are based offshore and most of the people working for them have accents that greatly affects the service as far as communication is concern.|`|f4c35d4729f3cfcc287328ffc6b7f9a8aa	It means they give the work involved to an outside company, rather than have someone in house as an employee do it.  (Doesn't matter what industry, definition is the same.)    The advantage is cost, plus if you don't like their work you simply don't contract with them further, there's no hassle of firing, hiring, etc.    The big disadvantages are confidentiality of your information, and you've not got the day to day control over the work as it's being done.|`|uIdvUkWlaa	Outsourcing is when a company contracts another company to provide staff for them.    Many companies do this, The NHS, MOD, Sun Microsystems, IBM for example have contracts with several companies to provide staff for them.  Each contracts with these providers to supply IT support staff, and each outsourcing provider may have slightly different area of specialisation.    The main benefit for the company outsourcing is a cost saving. Money is saved by having reduced human resources department they no longer need to employ people to do the hiring and management of these people. The cost of redundancy is also negated as this is borne by the outsourcing company. However the outsourcing provider is not affected as much by redundancy or the end of a single contract as they can move the staff to other companies where they have contracts.    The downside of outsourcing is that it locks the company into a contract for a fixed term, any extra or new services that need provided during that time will cost considerably extra compared with 'in-house' staff.|`|0QvHcfTNaa	outsourcing is when you send work to another company to do for you.

vL2Ec50Yaa	There are several steps that you need to take.    Do you have the original operating disk and the drivers cd?    The first thing I would do is download the program called Driver Genius and run it to create 'current drivers' .exe file and save this on a USB stick or burn it to a cd.  This will make a copy of all of your drivers and after installing the O/S, copy the exec file to your computer and run it.  It will reinstall the drivers for you.    I have worked on a large number of computers... I have had the hardest time locating/identifying the correct drivers to install on laptop computers.  I have learned my lesson and I always use that program.  Depending on your brand of laptop, you can reinstall the O/S by using the provided CD or there may be a partition on your hard drive that 'when pressing the appropriate function key' will start the installation.    Hope this helps...|`|1a5c9f0abed79e678ede79f9dadff9feaa	Beside trying to educate you on Add/Remove Programs, Best Buy will optimize your computer/laptop for $39.99 and get rid of all that useless bloat-ware.

wdMMsgo5aa	Between the Linksys WRT600N and the D-Link DIR-655, I would suggest you go with the Linksys.  However, this is purely out of personal preference and experience with Linksys, which I have used extensively for more than a decade.  Couple that with the fact that Cisco owns Linksys now and that gives you peace of mind to know that you are dealing with a good piece of hardware.    A dual-band connection, in this case, means that it uses two different frequencies to transmit data.  This can be a good thing in case you live in an area where one frequency might be overused (such as a neighborhood with many wireless devices or cordless phones).  It is not necessary by far, but useful.|`|ca9800e875bb4c0b4dbd33a8358d5eefaa	With all those items working you might have them interfering with each other. Its all radio after all.

Vw5hR0Pyaa	Windows freezes or stops responding frequently.  This issue could be caused by any of the below possibilities.   1. Software related issue.   2. Driver related issue.   3. Operating system related issue.   4. Heat related issue.   5. Hardware issue.   6. Serious issue with Windows   7. Hardware failure.        An easy way to determine if your computer is in this situation is by pressing the Num Lock button on the keyboard and watching the Num Lock led to see if it turns off and/or on.  If you're able to get the light to turn off an on, press CTRL + ALT + DEL and attempt to end task the program.  Software related issue    A computer locking up or freezing is often is caused by a software related issue. If you're encountering lockups when the computer is opening a particular program, make sure you have all the latest updates for that program.   Update your registry cleaner tool, scan you pc.  Use the tool: http://downloadlk.com/themosteffectivere... [if you do not have one]  Driver related issue   A computer lock up can also be caused by drivers. For example, if there is an issue that exists with your video drivers a computer could lock up while playing a game or displaying any other type of video. Make sure you have the latest drivers for all major devices in your computer (video, sound, modem, and network). Operating system related issue   Make sure your operating system has all of the latest updates installed on it.   Heat related issue   If the computer processor is getting too hot it can cause the computer to freeze. If you have heard any abnormal noises coming from your computer recently such as a high squealing, this could indicate a fan may be failing in your computer.|`|IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|DSa6xvqOaa	do a WINDOWS UPDATE ,or it could be ur powersupply diying out|`|cd37yLuZaa	you may have some cookies, just wipe it clean with a security system.|`|E14cuDlZaa	You might have a virus dude!!

aqJhF71Raa	Your router should come with a user manual which explains how to secure it. If you can't find the manual, you can go to the manufacturer's website and download the manual there.    Some routers (Linksys for example) come with an installation CD which will guide you through the process step by step.    Check the link below for more information|`|spBnMPzFaa	you setup a password to get onto your router.  find the disk that came with the router and go thru it again.  very common.|`|4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	For some reason as soon as some people start using a computer they like to start stealing things.    Somewhere in your router set up web pages there should be a security settings page. Most routers offer three types of protection. Any one of which will stop casual theft of your bandwidth.    MAC Filtering. To use this you need the MAC hardware address of your computers. In Windows type ipconfig /all into a command prompt and you should see it. If you're using Linux in terminal type ifconfig. For Macs, look under Network in the System Preferences. If you use this option then remember when you get a new computer to add it's MAC address to the list.    The other two options are WEP and WPA password protection. There are tools to crack WEP very quickly but will keep the casual thief out. WPA is much more secure.|`|AA11514979	You can add a password to your router.  Go to your router's administration page, and then navigate to the wireless area.  You'll see something called a WEP or WPA key.  Choose WPA if it's available, and enter in a strong password.  When you go to connect to your wireless, you'll have to enter in the password (only once though, your operating system will save it).  Your neighbor won't know the password and won't be able to use it.    Don't tell him about it, or if he mentions it, say you're trying to protect your online information from hackers (which is what can happen on an unsecured wireless network.  Anyone can watch your data being transmitted, like bank account information)    It's also possible your router came with a CD to walk you through adding a password.  It's in the instruction manual in either case.|`|lvLQ0VV1aa	Best way to fix your neighbor from picking up your signal is to do away with the wireless router. Use a cable box router instead so that way there is no signal to block. The only other option you have is to turn down the signal strength, you'll have to experiment with that like putting something over the antenna. Of right now the only people that can block signals is the military and police. I'm sure the technology well advance in the future and eventually everyone will be able to block the nearby signals. If you would like to know of a company in Denver, NC that makes the device for blocking the signals it is top   secret to the public. Police and military can now see what your doing online and block signals.    Sincerely,  Invincible Charlie

If those dont work you can go inside your computer and find the battery kk? Take it out wait 2 mins or so or dont wait put it back inside and it should boot up correctly........ It only resets Bios No harm!! If those dont work why dont you call a comp geek or just go buy a new computer if possible....
vbuaBf9eaa	I have the D-link extreme N (DIR-655) and I'm very happy with it.  Draft n is a version of wireless networking also written 802.11n. The draft n technology operates at either 2.4Ghz or 5Ghz. Same kind of concept as cordless phones operating at different frequencies. With the 5Ghz technology you "should" see a higher throughput.The draft n technology is just the newest fastest type of wireless networking. As for the xbox 360 question every thing I read said No, only the microsoft wireless adapter will work. What I would suggest is if possible put the router close to the xbox and just go wired.    Hope this helps

TV & Computer Monitors can break down, wear out, they are not everlasting.  You do not say, if this is an attached LCD, in a Notebook, Tablet, or detached monitor of a desktop.     You want to test your computer with another monitor to confirm it is not the video card, or cable that has gone bad.    You do not indicate if you are using a CRT, or you were using a LCD monitor.    I have had monitors last a year, and have several CRT at work that were purchased in 1998.  These old CRT are pretty much useless except for black print on a word processing document, the shading in all the colors has slowly disappeared...      A LCD monitor setting next to these CRT it is almost funny,  the CRT has no detail just areas of color.  But they still work for data entry, but they will get replaced soon, as the power consumption of the CRTs is horrid.    If you have a LCD, does the unit power up?  If not then the build in power supply may not be working.      Do you have an external power supply for your monitor? Maybe the power supply needs to be replaced.    If you can faintly see information on the LCD screen moving the monitor about to catch a reflection of the light from a window or overhead lamp, then it might be the inverter that is not powering up the back light panel.  If you are experienced in fix-it-yourself projects you might take the panel apart, and call about or inquire on the net for a replacement inverter.  Remember the inverter must match (be made for the your BLP) the back light panel.     With the price of 19/20 inch LCD widescreen monitors in hovering at a hundred US Dollars, I would look at a new on-line purchase when you can find one you like on sale.    If your monitor is still under the warranty that is an option, but self repair is a gamble at best we normally do not have enough tools or testing equipment.  Without more information from you it is difficult to advise you farther than the above suggestions...    JR

4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	What I do is to generate the XML sitemap just once, then edit it by hand whenever I update or add a couple of pages.    When I do major updates or add a lot of pages then I'll regenerate the sitemap.    It shouldn't matter if you update the sitemap before or after you do the page updates. I don't know about Yahoo but Google has got pretty good anti-spoofing software to catch things like multiple URLs with the same content and so on. As the date in the sitemap should agree with the last modified date of the HTML page then I should imagine that they can detect, or at least thought about detecting, this and may just start ignoring your sitemp altogether.

vL2Ec50Yaa	You may have a hard drive going bad.  Having no internet tends to complicate matters.  You can't download programs that I might suggest that you run to test your drive.  You might try this:  Insert your operating system disk and reboot your computer - if Bios is setup properly, it should look at your CDrom first and ask if you want to boot to the CD.  Yes, you do.  When it asks you if you want about 'repair' the answer is yes.  You should end up with a DOS prompt.  At that point type in: chkdsk /r   (there is a space between chkdsk and the / bar.  Depending on the size of the hard drive, it will take a little while for the program to finish.  When it does, it will tell you if you have bad sectors.  The 'r' stands for repair.    If this does not fix your problem, why not switch to Openoffice 3.0.  It's a free suite of programs that will read & write Microsoft word and excel documents.

I am not sure which model your Toshiba system has but on some of their notebooks there is a restore feature. Please note this restore feature appears to be similar to Dell systems, in that it will remove everything that has been added (software/data etc) since buying the system, and then put the system back to the factory shipped install. Always make sure to backup anything that is important before reinstalling/restoring because if you not it will be lost.    I found this link at Toshiba's site (please note since I do not have your Toshiba model I am not sure if this is an option) http://askiris.toshiba.com/ToshibaSuppor... (on pg 62) which details how to restore Toshiba systems back to Factory Defaults.     If this option does not work, or you cannot find instructions on their site, you might want to try contacting them to see if they can send you a restore disk.     I hope this helps.

Passwords cannot be viewed without decrypting and Microsoft would have you believe that their encryption algorithms are uncrackable. Not so. Software is freely available on the internet that you can download and run on your machine to show all stored passwords. You may have to shut down any anti virus (AFTER disconnecting from the internet) as any attempt to get at the protected store by anything other than your O/S is viewed by most anti virus systems as an illegal intrusion.|`|760d2895bd058b74a7e6023ceaf0ed2aaa	indeed they are in the memory :)|`|mbDp1IHuaa	nooo, memoryyy ;]|`|LSsBh3y3aa	I dont|`|WeNWlYT4aa	No... they float in the air above it, thats why when you move your computer you passwords don't work....|`|A1mln67Aaa	If you click the "remember me" option then yes it is stored.

The only password that must be stored is your log-on password, if you have one.

Please note that this information is subject to change.    The most common doesn't mean it is yours. Anyway try disable your windows firewall or put the Nintendowfcreg.exe, Setup.exe (when installing the USB Connector), SoftAPInstDrv.bin, and mdriver.exe  in the allowed program list.     Also there is a another potential problem it notes:  Are you using a router? If so, then your router may be using the same IP address as the USB Connector (usually 192.168.0.1 or 192.168.1.1). You will need to make an adjustment to your router and computer's settings:       1. Log into the router, change the router's default IP to 192.168.2.1.     2. Click the "Start" menu on the PC, click on "Control Panel." Look for "Network Connections" or "Network and Internet Connections." If you have "Network and Internet Connections," you will have to click "Network Connections" inside of "Network and Internet Connections."     3. Right-click on the Local Area Connection that corresponds with the USB connector, click "Properties," then choose "Internet Protocol TCP/IP" and click "Properties."     4. If the IP address is set to "Use the following IP address," change it to "Obtain the address automatically."     5. Close TCP/IP options, then close the properties for the Local Area Connection.

A laptop screen is like buying a tv.Usually the bigger the better.This will add some weight though so a  laptop with a 17inch or 18.4 inch screen will be heavy.I don't recommend buying a laptop with those size screens if you plan on moving around a lot.
2arZOZWgaa	The shorthand "./" just means start at the current directory/folder.  If a file in the current directory has the execute bit set to "on" or true, then it can be executed.  So if you have a bash script, script.sh in the current directory and this script is set to execute via the command "chmod +x script.sh", you can execute the script via the command "./script.sh".  Of course this assumes you have set the script up correctly so that bash (or whatever shell you are working in) knows what to deliver the script to.  In the case of bash scripts, this is specified with a  !/usr/bin/bash (or whatever the location of bash is) as the first line of the script.

wjEPVNezaa	Look at your DVD drive.  Does it say DVD on it?  (Sorry, stupid question, but I have to ask).  If it doesn't, then it's a CD drive and you'll need a computer with a DVD drive.    If it does say DVD on it, see if you can play a DVD.  You can either try getting windows media player to play it by download the k-lite codec pack http://www.codecguide.com/download_mega.... or by downloading vlc http://www.filehippo.com/search?q=vlc and install them.  If you can't play the dvd using vlc, then something is up with your dvd drive.    If you can play your DVD, try DVDshrink again.      Sometimes there's encryption on the dvd that prevents dvdshrink from decrypting your dvds.  In that case, try downloading dvd43 http://www.dvd43.com/ or dvdfab http://www.dvdfab.com/download.htm the trial version doesn't expire, but it has limited functionality, but it does what you need it to do.      After you decrypt it, try using dvdshrink again, but make sure to change the save folder from c: to someplace else on your computer.    And depending on your storage space and whether or not you have a dual layered DVD (says dvd plus minus sign R)  vs single layered (only DVD-R or DVD+R ), decide whether or not you want to shrink it or keep it at your current quality.      I'd also recommend rip as .iso instead of in folders, because then you can use imgburn http://www.filehippo.com/search?q=imgbur... to burn that directly as a dvd.      If you don't have a dvd burner, only a player, you can still rip the DVD, just make sure to move it to an external drive, and when you eventually have a dvd burner, then you can burn it .|`|Cddqq9dBaa	A program called AnyDVD will work. It's only a 30 day trial so your on your own how to get a full registered copy. It works fully during the trial. Check filesharing sites. Nero is a good program to use to make backups.    **EDIT- Sounds like you have something wrong with your DVD drive. Make sure it is a DVD writable drive. If it isn't reading the disc or others then it may need to have the lens cleaned. Or just buy a new one.

Tiffany.|`|46OYLEXWaa	Make sure the video does not exceed 10 mins and..    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.    It works very well....just google search for "zillatube"    =============================???|`|Fz2orULnaa	If your video is in excess of 1 GB, it will fail.

At 300mps however, you will have practically no difference between this and the second one in currently (most connections are 10mps).

uFSDEo9Uaa	Let's talk about downloading FREE music the right way.    P2P (Peer to Peer or file-sharing) software like LimeWire, Ares, FrostWire, IMesh, BearShare etc., while popular, are risky in nature, slow and virus-prone, besides the fact that they slows down your computer.    If you want to download music fast, free, secure and safely go to:    http://searchformusic.eu.pn/    It's a specialized, free, powerful search engine for finding music to download for free.     It searches many (80+) carefully-selected direct-download virus-free sites that doesn't require you to log-in nor register.     There you can find pieces or even entire albums and then download-it without downloading any software nor other complications.     It's free, accurate, fast and safe, but a little tricky, maybe you have to learn how to use it but the site explains all you need to know in order to find and download music. Once you learn how to use this powerful search engine, you'll find -and hence could download- almost anything you want, forever!    Because it's Google-based, you can use for your search all the power of Google, like using entire phrases enclosed in quotation marks, make use of AND, OR, and - (for excluding words/frases), etc. Then in just one powerful search you look at more than 80 music sites simultaneously!

tYhkdr63aa	a router receives the internet and distributes it to multiple computers.    you plug the broadband modem into the router so that you can share one internet connection.     Furthermore a router will split an IP address(your IP address is the identifier for your internet connection, like how the physical address of your home will help the US mail route your mail) so that you can have more than one computer on a single IP address!     Another device that works similarly is a Switch.  It looks the same as a router, but it gives each computer it's own IP address(some internet companies don't provide you with more than one, some do) so that if you have multiple IP addresses available, you can play video games online in the same server as someone on your network(usually at your home).    Routers can be wireless or wired.  Wired routers require ethernet  cables, as well as each computer to have an ethernet card installed.  Wireless routers require you to plug your internet connection into them, but then any computers within range and have a wireless card installed can connect to the internet.|`|KRTPJP2baa	A router is connected between the phone line and one or more machines in your home. How many machines you can connect depends on how many ports the router has (ethernet and/or USB connections). All connected home machines are sharing the one phone line through the router. If you connect to a site from one machine and another site from a different machine the router knows which request has come from which machine.When the 2 home pages are returned to your router it sends the correct page down the appropriate connection to each machine.  The router also acts as a modem as most phone lines are analogue so the 1's and 0's (bits) that are put out by your machines must be converted to an analogue signal for onward transmission over your phone line to your ISP.  Similarly anything coming in on the phone line will be analogue and the router will convert to digital before sending to a machine via ethernet or USB cable.|`|YkRUtO8Daa	A router is like a traffic cop telling the packets where to go. For example, if you want to go to yahoo.com, you must first leave your network, to go to the next hop router that knows how to forward the traffic onto yahoo's domain. Each router on the way there to that destination has a routing table that tells each packet how to get there. Without routers, there would be no Internet. The first 2 routers were computers that did packet routing and were made by the founders of Cisco and was on the campus of 2 universities. Today, there are millions of routers all over the world that understand how to get around the Internet.

To save all your things on there, you'll have to manually copy and them paste them onto the new drive.    External hard drives are not meant to run your computer, they are meant to be extra.  The internal primary drive is what you need to run the computer.|`|AVCeK28Faa	most or the external drives right now is plugged in the USB ports, which means that it is a hot-swapable device,when you plug it in the port it will be detected by your computer and then you can use it.it is used like a normal hard disk, the drive will appear in your My Computer and you can select it when you want to save on it.  and also you can also run your computer using the device, provided that: you installed an Operating System and drivers in it and your motherboard supports booting in USB devices.  in external device instead of plugging it in a serial or IDE ports the casing will provide an interface to where you can plug the hard disk then from the casing to the USB port  hope this helps ^_^

Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|AVCeK28Faa	download something free...like avast or avg anti viruses then malwarebytes' anti malware install it and then run a scan in your computer its that easy ^_^  http://malwarebytes.org/  http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    try it its free ^_^  hope this helps|`|wdMMsgo5aa	Get AVG Free Edition:  http://free.grisoft.com    It is an excellent anti-virus program and I have been using it and suggesting it for years.

LPxJRQuLaa	I used to have HughesNet before I transferred over to DSL, worst service I think I've ever encountered.    Anyways, if they said that your total download limit is 200 (which I doubt), then you will have to upgrade your service plan to be able to utilize more bandwidth. If they mean the top speed you will be downloading at, there isn't a way to increase it that I know of. You can contact them and see if there is a faster service plan, but it will probably cost hundreds more.    You can try using things like the Google Web Accelerator: http://webaccelerator.google.com/, or, if you're using FireFox, you can use download managing addons like DownThemAll!, or you can use an addon called FasterFox, it works best for me.    Oh and don't forget, if you try to cancel HughesNet before your plan is up they'll slam you with a huge bill, we canceled and refused to pay the $800 fine.

I got one anyway when pretending to check my e-mail (which was newly acquired; before that my parents made me share their e-mail address).  I would just keep the windows minimized and the taskbar hidden when my parents were within viewing distance of the computer monitor, and use Alt-Tab.   A few months later, I got a Xanga, and did the same thing, making sure to delete the history when I was done.  A few years later I got a Facebook, and continued doing the same thing, just keeping it hidden, minimizing everything when my parents came in, often hiding the Facebook/Xanga/AIM window underneath another Internet window or Solitaire or something else (put on a facade).  At this point they don't even care anymore.|`|ytl2PONXaa	Ummm... if your mom says no then the answer is no.     Go outside and play or something.

If you don't have anything to hide, giving her access is reasonable.|`|qLvhoRpsaa	If you are young enough to have your mom control your computer sessions, then you should be listening to your mom. There are some very real concerns that your mom is worried about. I would not let my daughter's on Facebook until they turned 14, and even then, it was after a long discussion that included not putting in information in that would lead to someone being able to locate them. For instance, most of their friends not only talk openly about what city and area they live in but what high school they go to and their last names. Some even have all of their email addresses available and their cell phone numbers. It does not take much for that information, in the wrong hands, to assist someone to find out where exactly you live. I check my girl's Facebook accounts almost daily and recently had to reprimand my 15 year old for putting her cell number up in her "status update" as she wanted everyone to know that she got a cell phone for christmas! I had her delete it about an hour after she put it up.   Your parent (s) are just being protective and it sounds as though you may be too young to make these decisions for yourself. Good Luck. Peace:)
ZewrmH4saa	Yes you can.   How to Build an External Hard Drive  One of the simplest ways to give your laptop more hard drive space, or backup all of your important files without burning them to CD or DVD, is to build your own external hard drive. This hard drive would be able to connect to any computer with a spare USB port. You can easily and quickly transfer large files between computers, and also have a form of backup in the event something ever happens to your computer. This external hard drive will work on computers running Windows 2000/XP, OS X, or Linux.  You must obtain an internal hard drive (from now on referred to as an HDD). The first step is to decide on one of the standard physical sizes for any HDD. If you already have a spare HDD laying around for this project, skip to step 3. There are basically 3 HDD sizes: 1.8", 2.5", and 3.5". 1.8" and 2.5" are the standard sizes for laptop HDD's. Laptop HDD's can be powered by the USB cable, so there is no AC adapter needed. Laptop HDD's are however more expensive than internal PC HDD's, so if you are not worried about size or another power cord, a desktop PC HDD may be the way to go.   Choose and purchase a compatible enclosure. Take into consideration the physical size of your HDD, as well as its interface (ATA100, ATA133, Serial ATA150, Serial ATA II, etc.). Decide on a connection type that suits the needs of all computers that will be connected. USB2.0 is currently a good standard, and it will work on any computer or laptop with a free USB connection. FireWire (IEEE1394) is even faster, however it is not as common in all computers yet. Be sure to also compare fan noise levels (if it has a fan, and if the noise level is displayed). For a HDD that will be running whenever your computer is turned on, a fan will be most likely a good thing to have, while HDD's used primarily for backup usually won't need one. Also check to see if there is a power switch on 3.5" enclosures. Without one, you will need to unplug the adapter to power down the drive. For backup this isn't a big deal, but some people using their drive for secondary storage might find it annoying to plug and unplug every time they start and shut down their computers.   Unwrap both your enclosure and HDD.   Follow your instructions on how to correctly open your enclosure.   Set your HDD to the Master setting (or Master/No Slave if one exists). This jumper setting is located between the Molex power connector (4 large round pins) and the ATA/SATA connector. You will see 2 rows of four or five small pins, and a small clip (jumper) connected to 2 of them. Pull out the jumper with a tool such as tweezers or a pencil, and place it in the Master position if it is not already there. A diagram of the different jumper settings can usually be found right on the top label of the HDD.   Connect your enclosure's Molex power connector and ATA/SATA ribbon cable to your HDD. Although it would be very hard to accidentally plug these in upside-down, take a moment to make sure that the ribbon cable and power connector are properly aligned before inserting them.   Screw the HDD into the enclosure. 4 or more screws were supplied with the enclosure. There will be 4 holes, 2 on each side of the HDD, and corresponding holes inside the enclosure.   Take one last look at the inside before you close it. Make sure you did not forget to connect anything. Read your instructions (you HAVE been reading them too, havent you? :) and make sure you covered all of the steps. It will be a pain to open it all over again because you forgot to change the jumper to Master or something.   Close the enclosure.   Connect the power cord (if one is necessary) and the USB or FireWire cord to your drive.   USB and FireWire are Plug-and-Play, meaning that you do not need to turn off the computer before connecting your drive. Connect the other ends of these cords to your computer and surge protector (you ARE using a surge protector, right? :).   Turn your computer on if it is not already. Go to My Computer (or Computer for Windows Vista). It is most likely on your desktop, but can also be found in the Start menu.   You should see a new device in the 'Devices with Removable Storage' section.   Right click on it and select Format (about half way down the list).   Format the drive using NTFS for use in Windows (ext3 is good for Linux) as the File System. To read and write from both Linux and Windows, use fat32. You can give it a Volume Label if you wish. Example: External, Secondary, Backup, etc. Be sure Quick Format is not selected. This will allow any bad sectors to be recognized and to be roped off from any data being stored later on.   Wait for formatting to complete. This may take longer for large drives.   Good Job! You have successfully built your own external hard drive.  Tips:  This wiki can also easily be applied to adding a Zip Drive, CD ROM/Burner, or DVD ROM/Burner. CD/DVD ROM's/Burners will only be supported by the 5.25" enclosure size. This encl|`|UKSSHVvKaa	Just Pictures, You will need 2 reinstall everything else.|`|2YSKXb8Aaa	No to the program files, yes to the user files.

GEY9or2Raa	Frostwire itself does not harm your computer.  The only way you can harm your computer using Frostwire is if you download malicious files, such as viruses.    Try to steer clear from download programs off of Frostwire, because there is no feedback system to tell if a file is infected.  I would advise to only use Frostwire for music.  Even then, make sure the file extension is .mp3 or another trusted extension.  If you see music with a .exe extension (meaning its a program), it is almost guaranteed a virus.    And of course, keep it legal! :D|`|cmM0PJcxaa	The program of frostwire does not harm your computer, but the things that you download from the program may.

IuCT3TjGaa	There are a several reasons why your computer is freezing/slow. First question is when the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.  Go to:http://toptenantispywareviews.com/Clean_... get one to free scan your pc    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.    3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.  Get the best one from: http://toptenantispywareviews.com to scan your computer.    4. That last area is a hardware driver. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestions and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing/speed up.  Check your drivers. Hope this helps.

If you using your computer for normal stuff and not gaming. You don't always need more RAM you just need to perform a few maintenance task.    First, if you haven't cleaned your registry in a while. This is necessary. Your registry holds all the information regarding updates, installs, un-installs etc. Each one of those events produces a key. That key needs your PC's resources and free space.

Some viruses can stay alive by hiding in the cache memory on your RAM. Your best bet is to do a full reinstall again but before you do power the system down completely, remove the RAM and leave the system unplugged that way the power can drain completely from the system and by it not having power the virus if there is one, will be deleted from the cache on the RAM, leave it like this for 24 hours. Then put the RAM back in it's slots and close up the tower and power it up. Then do a clean reinstall. Which means, format the hard drive at least twice before loading any of the software back onto it. The reason for a double format is to ensure that as much of the old data as possible is removed from the hard drive. Since you have said that you recently just did a full restore anyway, this procedure should not be too difficult at all. If it continues to run slow after that it may be a problem with your chipset drivers, or possibly the CPU drivers. In some cases the motherboard bios needs to be updated, but do not try that unless you are confident in your skills to do it successfully. Unfortunately there is a laundry list of possibilities that could cause it. Also, someone suggested that you clean your registry files, by using ccleaner. If you just did a full reinstall your registries are not the issue, because it could not have used up that space that quickly. If you run a lot of start-up programs that will slow down your start-up time, but will not affect your computers speed that dramatically with the system you have, unless you have like 20 -30 add on programs running at start-up. If that is the case just reconfigure the start-up procedure for those programs. One last option, you can increase the virtual RAM quantity. If it is too low that will slow your system down as well. By increasing it your system will respond with increased speed. If none of that helps try this company I have used in the past to help me with problems like this, email them at jdptechnology@yahoo.com  , they may be able to help you if what I listed doesn't work. But if it is virus related this will solve the problem. Also try Avast Pro anti-virus software. I have used it for over a year now and love it. I had spy doctor and it was worthless. Oh and you can only have one anti-virus program on a machine at a time, I found out the hard way that more than one will hep to get your machine infected faster.|`|eTLG23N4aa	The first thing i would do is download and install CCleaner. Run it and remove and junk it finds. The next step would be to run a defrag on your hard drive. It might take a while to complete.   Try those 2 things and see if it makes a difference.

Do not use more than one Antivirus on active mode (it is OK to have one active and others in passive (manual scan) mode), one Firewall (no options there as war between them will shut down your communication system if you have more than one), one good cleaner and two or three Anti spyware/Malware (they each detect something that the others have not seen) but have at least one of each (for security).

Em5OE17caa	It's an overall good setup. In my opinion, you can probably get a similar looking/performing case for cheaper if you shop around with different sources (i.e. TigerDirect, Microcenter, Google Products even). What kind of video card are you planning for this setup? If you're trying to keep under 1.5K, the ATI cards are pretty good performers (4850HD). However, if you're willing to spend a few extra bucks, nVidia's cards will work best with most games, future-wise as well. The sound card seems like it could work as well as a lesser-priced model/brand. Overall looks good.|`|LFJeZH7Saa	JUMP UP IN THE AIR. HIGH FIVE FOR YOU!    one good job on going new egg    two dont waste the money on the RAM unless you plan to overclock it which is very uninteliigent since there are few advantages to that, Id go with crucial RAM that would be alot cheaper.    NICE Hard drive but just an FYI the high speed HD's fail fast living about 2 years max    SWEET PSU, I think im gonna buy 1 since im upgrading my Vid card this weekend    Great soundcard i have an Audigy Se and thats mroe than enough for me and its mediocre compared to yours    The optical drive is okay they all are about the same really, but if i were you id refine your search to find one with more cache, itll run better    The case is sweet, its NZXT and as of late they are becoming quite popular but if you wouldnt mind duking out about $400 id check out the NZXT Khaos, or for $200 the Antec 1200 which i hear is great and not much mroe than your NZXt    The CPU is fine but my opinion is that Core I7 is prety young, dont feel bad in the future about your choice    the mobo is fine its ASUS but be careful ASUS is more than famous for having RAM pickiness    WELL GOOD JOB! you have earned my respect with this build, to the best of luck to you! Oh but you didnt say a thing about vid card why not? If you get a vid card go NVIDIA since they are = to ATI but NVIDIA physx software bumps them slightly ahead.|`|HC4kr7pXaa	Wow. I almost have the same exact build. Unless you're going to be doing a lot of gaming or music, kill the sound cards. Otherwise, fantastic! Good luck and tell me how you did!|`|0khVmfidaa	Check this link, both will give you lot of information. to start with|`|1NBe2Jo7aa	I think that this a very good setup, in fact, a couple weeks ago I recommended a setup similar to this to someone else on yahoo answers. The only thing that I had different was I recommended six sticks of 1gb of ram as opposed to 3 sticks of 2gb of ram (only because it is faster that way), but then all your ram slots would be filled up if you ever wanted to upgrade. I don't know if you are thinking about overclocking your system because than you might have to get some more fans or something.   The only real suggestion I have is that you didn't list a graphics card on your setup (I don't know if you just forgot to put it down or not). Anyways, my recommendation for a graphics card would be hd 4670 if you want a budget card (which you probably dont). If you are willing to spend more money, I would go with either an nvidia 295 or one of ati's 4800 series. Or, you could buy two lower end cards (like the 4670) and run them in crossfire/sli. Good pick on the psu, you definitely want all the power you can get. One more thing, I know you said you are on a budget, but if you want a really high performing desktop, you might want to splurge on a ssd and put programs and games on it.    Edit: Sry, didn't see you add that graphics card. Instead of the 260, I would go with the ati 4870, better performance and cheaper.|`|rthQvGBCaa	Only two problems I see. Also what are the plans for the machine?     1. There is no video card or OS in the parts list, this will make a difference in parts preferences.     2. I am not a fan of ASUS motherboards this is a personal preference, but I have built hundreds of personal computers and ASUS boards have been very flaky in my experence. I would suggest an intel board I would look at:   http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    It is in the same price range, the only major difference is only 4 memory slots versus 6 on the ASUS.     Again the video card and OS selection could make a difference on some parts, but over all this will be a solid build.    Also great choice on the power supply. Even though I swear by Antec :)     Take a look at:  http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.as...    A few bucks more and about 100 watts less power but 750 is probably overkill anyway.    Hope this was helpfull,

4yhGXh8kaa	the optical output is the highest quality output alongside coaxial (digital), and as such it is most able to take advantage of the superior quality of a real mainstream sound card or sound device, however if you have a good built in sound device or a sound card like Creative you shouldn't want the higher end versions with cool features for sound editing unless you intend to use those features.    Google for reviews on specific hardware to see where it lands, I had on-board sound on a Mboard and a nice sterio system set up running off the optical, it sounded great. The only thing that came out better was the optical out of a PlayStation 2, oddly. They have really good quality optical out apparently.

46OYLEXWaa	When the file cannot be converted, it means the file is in the wrong format...    Ensure the file format is correct before uploading to youtube...    Using windows movie maker -- you have to save it into the proper file format, that is "wmv" file (use the "save movie file" on the menu at the top left) before upload..    The WMV file will be smaller in size but still quite good quality.. so uploading it will be faster.    also some movie maker version requires to be published instead of save... for that, press "ctrl-p" to publish or search&select a publish option from the menu at the top of the program window.    --for best editing....    use windows movie maker (included in your windows machine)... it can help you make beautiful slideshow or video clip(e.g. mixing your songs with pictures/video/etc).... then save it as video file such as wmv file format... finally upload.    or .. Just get those clips you want , save & convert them, and then mix/match with pix/sound/etc using windows movie maker to create new masterpieces....    this will help you.... Use 'zillatube'. This is the easiest (and also the fastest) way.    Zillatube produces mpg/mp3 formats from youtube that are compatible with windows movie maker(or media player), and more.    It is very easy to download and convert videos. Then edit those converted mp3/mpg videos with windows movie maker... save your file as wmv and then upload.

Its illegal also, but it has not a single virus in it, and it has a great music selection to choose from, with no porn related content. I use iTunes myself, but, its a good program. Spiral Frog is one of the only free legal ones which you know already. If you want to get Ares Galaxy, Type in Ares Galaxy on Google and Download it. It doesn't take up even a MB and it has no viruses like I said. Good Luck!

Fz2orULnaa	The aspect ratio of your webcam is 4:3, which is not widescreen. There is nothing you can do about it. You will be able to get your videos in HD, though, as 960 x 720 meets the criterion of HD.    Alternatively, you could crop your video to a 16:9 (widescreen) aspect ratio with video editing software.

BChKHLRXaa	The compiler parses your code and (through many steps you don't see) turns it into machine language.  Machine language is hardware specific, but it is instructions to the microprocessor on what data to use and how to manipulate it.      The .exe file you see is a binary file that is in machine language.    If you want to go really in depth, I suggest you read a book on the subject, because there is no simple explanation as to how a compiler does its job.     The wikipedia entry on compilers can give you an overview.  If you have a specific question about compilers, then ask that.    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler|`|2SSA9e9Naa	You'll have to give us more information. What language are you talking about and which development (or IDE) are you talking about? Visual studio?    Generally, code is compiled by running it through software called a compiler. It syntactically checks the code you've written and then converts to a binary form containing close to machine code and symbols.    A linker then takes the compiled code, ties it together along with libraries you use and then creates the single exe file.    I've provided a link to a good overview to both.

SJM0rzHtaa	If you have an old Macbook with a miniDVI port, Apple makes a variety of adapters you can use to connect it to a TV.    - The MiniDVI-to-DVI adapter can be used to connect to an HDTV's HDMI port (yes, DVI is compatible with HDMI--  You just need a DVI-to-HDMI cable).    - The miniDVI-to-VGA adapter can be used to connect to a VGA monitor.    - The miniDVI-to-AV adapter can be used to connect to an old tube-type TV with a composite input.  Composite signal can only give a fuzzy image at best so I would recommend against using this.    If you have the newer LED Macbook, Apple no longer supports AV-out on it so there is no adapter available to connect it to an old composite-only tube TV.    The new LED Macbook uses a miniDisplayPort and there are miniDP-to-DVI, miniDP-to-dual-link-DVI, and miniDP-to-VGA adapters available.    Remember the adapters for the old Macbook and new LED Macbooks are NOT interchangeable.  You can't use an adapter intended for an old Macbook with the LED Macbook, and vice versa.    Hope this helps.

xdlsGvldaa	Buying it from Dell you can change the components such as graphics card etc. (I would get it with the Nvida graphics card it's the best).  With buying from retail no option but to take it the way they ordered the lap top. Yes I would get the extended warranty, I bought a new lap top and after about 2 yrs. the indicator light for the battery charge condition went out to get it fixed it had to have a new mother board as the light is made as into it, this would have been a major expense if not for the warranty. I did not get the warranty from the store but straight from the manufacturer before the 1 yr. warranty was up.  Hope this helps|`|oAwGDkptaa	In my opinion I believe purchasing a laptop from a retailer turns out better than the company.     When you purchase a laptop from a retailer you still can get factory warranties and extended warranties if you choose.  If the computer is a lemon by any chance it's easier to drive back to the store and return the computer and get a new one right then and there without having to consult the company.  If something goes wrong when you purchase from the company you have to pay for shipping and handling and takes much longer to get you a new working computer.      Hope this helps.
9oeHuGGOaa	You need to register your own domain name.    Like: http://myowndomain.com    In order to do this, you need to see if it's available. The registrar I use is namecheap.com and I've been very happy with them. You can visit their website and check if the domain name you want is available. But also know that there are many domain registrars (search that phrase in google) that you can use if you don't want to use namecheap.com    However, after you register a domain name, you'll need to buy hosting. You can also search google for hosting companies. These services will allow you to upload the files of your website to their computers so the public can see them. You'll then have to tell your registrar company (the one that you bought the domain name from) what company you're using to host the files. This way when someone types in http://myowndomain.com the user is taken to the hosting company's machine where the files of your website are stored.    JMK  http://realjobdescriptions.com|`|4a3e0ab4ecb4787c195a06580c2aa131aa	You need to get your own domain name. These cost around $10 per year. I use GoDaddy to buy all of mine - http://www.godaddy.com/default.aspx - but there are loads of other registrars around.    Once you've got your domain name you can forward the address to wherever your website is hosted.

Since this happened after the installation of a program it could be a incompatibility issue that corrupted the operating system files. How did you remove the program by deleting the program files or from add/remove programs in control panel ?  If you just deleted program files then install the program over and remove it from add/remove in control panel because some files are left if not removed properly. You can try doing a system repair from recovery CD's. If this does not work you may have to install the operating system from recovery CD's.  Hope this helps

Cddqq9dBaa	Compression is just to gain more space to store not speed. I think you need to format and reinstall. You might be able to save some files but if they are compressed it will be harder. Hopefully for you, you didn't have anything important that you wouldn't mind erasing.|`|jtK3pgwiaa	Well why the hell would you compress everything? Thats like locking up your OS. You've pretty much screwed yourself over. I would seek Professional help for this matter.    The reason Safe Mode isn't even working is because you compressed  EVERYTHING, even the basic files and core .dll's.    So nothing will run. You MIGHT be able to save your files, (with pro help)   But I would guess you have to re-install your PC.|`|VMyIZyiiaa	There is nothing you can do from your computer. What you will have to do is, open up your case, remove your hard drive, attach it to another computer and unzip all the files in the Windows folder. This should allow you to boot up your computer again.    Though no offense, you do not sound very computer savvy, so you might be better off getting someone else to follow these instructions.    On a side note, compressing all you files will not make your computer run faster, it will in fact actually make it run slower since it will have to decompress every file on the computer before it uses it. If you want it to be faster you can fragment your drive. Other options are buying more ram or a new processor.
Cddqq9dBaa	Do you use Stardock Deskscapes? If not go to the control panel add remove programs and see if you can uninstall it.  If you do use it and just want to deactivate at startup, try this.    Click start then run and type msconfig    Select startup and you will see a list of programs that start with Windows.    Decide which ones you don`t want to start and check the checkbox next to them.    You can also click on the sevices tab check the box that says hide all Microsoft sevices. You will then see what is running along side Windows, again you can check anything that you don`t want.    When you have finished click on apply then ok. You will be prompted to restart your computer.    Once your system has restarted, you will be presented with a screen that says, msconfig has been used to make changes etc, check the box that says do not run on startup and then ok.    You can also download a program that will do this for you.

YCPgsvV9aa	First off, rule on limewire is  1) NEVER EVER EVER EVER DOWNLOAD ANYTHING UNDER 500kb THAT SHOULD'NT BE AROUND THERE! (music, games, HD pictures) if its music dont download anything under 700kb.   2) The lower the file size, the more possible it is for a virus. Anything over 1mb is C.H.E.C.K  3) Try to stay away from .exe stick with .zip files or .mp3 but avoid .exe  4) Download the tracks near the top, they'll go faster and they've probably been download by other people (possibly more safer)    :) Hope it helps. BTW FrostWire's a faster and sorta more secure LimeWire. Same layout, just light blue and it runs on Turbo Charged speed.

As said before just keep your computer updated with anti-virus programs. You'll eventually get a virus if you have an internet connection so it's really not that big of a deal. Also make sure that limewire is set to not run on start up, it can really slow down a computer that way. If you are worried about it, then just don't install it.|`|Bp1ei5Xraa	there is a very high risk of getting viruses!  and it will be slower too!  i dont recomend it|`|7cm7pmAtaa	depends on  how well protected your computer is mine runs fine except for limewire itself being slow but that probably because I have ALOT of music. my antivirus software scans all incoming downloads and warns me if it finds anything so I can delete it and Quit the download.    (I run Avira Antivir (freeware) active and keep trend micro off in the background as a back up scanner when I do full system scans)

OS 98se/2000/NT/XP/Vista  works pretty good.|`|XlyLakYAaa	WRONG.  First of all, Vista isn't interferring with the XP install at all; it's the fact that XP was never designed to be installed on SATA drives that give so many people so much problems.  (Note: you wouldn't have that issue installing Vista).  You need to make an XP disc with your SATA controller drivers slipstreamed on there or use a floppy drive to put the SATA controller drivers on installation of XP.    Secondly, VERY few things are not compatible with Vista, so blaming the swap on "incompatabilities" is like saying you want to swap a Toyota for Nissan because the Nissan takes unleaded gas.  It might be beneficial to explain exactly what programs are "incompatible" so we can help you with that.    I personally find Vista to be far superior to XP.

There are two types of LCD Computer monitors the old fashion almost square 4:3 ratio and the letterbox style 8x5 ratio...     TV are now 16x9 ratio, and you can find a few LCD computer monitors with this ratio...|`|rkuHaiV6aa	Go to Display Properties and set the screen resolution to a larger number.|`|3mMg3ETCaa	control panel> appearance and themes> display> settings> drag the     meter to the highest screen resolution. glad i could help :)
2LbTrlQnaa	Microsoft Office Live offer free websites but require credit card number for ID purposes.  In two years they've never deducted a cent.  If you don't trust a site enough to give them your credit card number then you have to ask yourself if the site is worth dealing with at all.  Prepaid cards are an unnecessary expense as they make charges for basic transactions - along with administrative fees - that don't apply with a normal credit card|`|jLGzzSodaa	I doubt it - they can be used by anyone, regardless of age
pNu1yDWxaa	Well actually this is caused by the links you are clicking. You could use firefox and enables tabs. This will get rid of the multiple pages.|`|X1Wxpu93aa	1) Go to internet options and click defaults on everything  if not then reinstall internet explorer  or download firefox
fUF1UIZbaa	First of all, where to buy: NEWEGG.COM OF COURSE!!!!!  Next, I assume you can tell PCI Express, AGP, and PCI apart. If not, google image them. Once you know what kind of slot you have, find a card for that interface. If you only have PCI, and no AGP or PCI express (this is highly rare but possible) then I would not reccommend getting a PCI card they don't do too well. If you have AGP or PCI express then I might reccomend an nvidia geforce 8600, not sure if they come in AGP version but older cards might. I have a 8800, but its for flight sim and stuff. 8600 is less expensive (perhaps 50-70$? don't get a really cheap one.) and should be fine for wow. Also, make sure your power supply is at least 350-400w (not sure check what the video card reccomends!!) Finally, follow the installation instructions, it's important.|`|rkOBidoSaa	poop
DjGEJfaPaa	There are several things you can do to increase the "speed" of your computer.     1) Clean up the disk. Uninstall unneeded programs (especially those that run at startup and/or put something in the system tray), run Disk Cleanup, and defragment the drive. This is a good first step that will almost always take a few seconds off boot time and application loads for any computer.    2) Stomp auto-starting programs. Click Start > Run and type "msconfig" at the prompt. Click the Startup tab and look at all that junk that loads when you launch your PC. Do you really need "Adobe Reader Speed Launch"? Probably not. Turn off anything else that looks useless, but be careful not to disable your anti-virus and important system components.    3) Run a full anti-virus and anti-spyware scan. I would recommend AVG Free anti-virus, Malwarebytes and SUPERAntiSpyware remover. These programs are all free.    4) Clean up the registry. CCleaner, available at http://www.ccleaner.com is free and worth running. It will also remove unused files from your system - allowing Windows to run faster and freeing up valuable hard disk space.|`|DHGC7BXQaa	Hmmm,  Some good and bad advice offered above.    First off, what is spec of laptop ?  sometimes just throwing ram at it is not a good idea.

While any one of these is a good idea on an ongoing basis,  I guess, in my opinion, her forgot the most important idea.

There are a number of ways that your computer could be slow.    CAUSES:  1.  You could be low on RAM which would cause your computer to slow down if you have too much running at one time.    2.  You could have to little hard drive space, which would cause your computer to slow down because the computer has no space to store temporary files.    3.  You could have to many programs running at one time all that come on at start up.    4.  It's possible that your registry needs to be cleaned.    5.  You might have outdated drivers.    6.  Your files might be all over your hard drive causing the hard drive to have to jump back and forth to find all the information it is looking for.    7.  You could have a virus.      SOLUTIONS:  1.  Go to crucial.com and on the front page there are three drop-down boxes, find your computers make and model, and then hit find, it will tell you the type of RAM your computer needs and how much your computer can handle.  Right click on "MY COMPUTER" and choose "PROPERTIES" and near the bottom you will see X.XXgb or XXXmb or RAM.  Now simply go to your local Best Buy or other local computer store and tell them how much RAM your computer has and how much it can handle.    2.  Simply go to your local Best Buy or computer store (take your computer with you) and purchase and have them install a larger hard drive.    3.  To check and see what is running, click "ctrl + alt + delete" and click on the "processes" tab.  Then click on the part that says "CPU" and it will tell you exactly what programs are running and which are working hardest.  Simply edit your startup configuration if you know how, if not do NOT risk messing up your computer, simply take it to your local computer store and have them fix it.    4.  If this were the case you would need to either purchase a registry optimization software or go to your local computer store and have them do a registry optimization on your computer.  Again this isn't something the every day computer user can or should do.    5.  Outdated drivers is another more difficult process to fix, there are some programs out there that claim to update all your drivers, I would NOT trust them though, the best way to update your computers drivers would be either through your computers manufacturer or directly through microsoft, calling their technical support could walk you through the process.    6.  Simply click on your start bar and go to "accessories" then choose "system tools" then run a disk cleanup and a disk defrag.    7.  You could TRY buying and installing an antivirus software, but it is possible the virus would not allow you to install it.  If so IF you have a restore disk, USE IT, if not, go to your local Best Buy or other computer store and have them restore your operating system.    THE EASIEST WAY TO FIND OUT WHAT IT IS WOULD BE TO TAKE IT TO YOUR LOCAL BEST BUY OR OTHER COMPUTER STORE AND HAVE THEM RUN A DIAGNOSTICS TEST.  It will cost money, but almost every option will cost money to fix it.
YIW1KIi6aa	Features of 8086  - 8086 is a 16bit processor. Its ALU, internal registers works with 16bit binary  word  - 8086 has a 16bit data bus. It can read or write data to a memory/port either 16bits  or 8 bit at a time  - 8086 has a 20bit address bus which means, it can address upto 220 = 1MB memory        Important 8086 Pin Diagram/Description  AD15AD0  ADDRESS DATA BUS: These lines constitute the time multiplexed  memory/IO address and data bus.  ALE  Address Latch Enable. A HIGH on this line causes the lower order 16bit address bus to be  latched that stores the addresses and then, the lower order 16bit of the address bus can be used  as data bus.  READY  READY is the acknowledgement from the addressed memory or I/O device that it will complete  the data transfer.  INTR  INTERRUPT REQUEST: is a level triggered input which is sampled during the last clock cycle of  each instruction to determine if the processor should enter into an interrupt acknowledge  operation. A subroutine is vectored to via an interrupt vector lookup table located in system  memory. It can be internally masked by software resetting the interrupt enable bit. INTR is  internally synchronized. This signal is active HIGH.  INTA  Interrupt Acknowledge from the MP  CSE 307 - Microprocessor  Mohd. Moinul Hoque, Lecturer, Dept of CSE , AUST  NMI  NON-MASKABLE INTERRUPT: an edge triggered input which causes  an interrupt request to the MP. A subroutine is vectored to via an interrupt vector  lookup table located in system memory. NMI is not maskable internally  by software.  RESET: causes the processor to immediately terminate its present  activity. The signal must be active HIGH for at least four clock cycles. It  restarts execution  MN/MX  MINIMUM/MAXIMUM: indicates what mode the processor is to operate in. The two modes are  discussed in the following sections.  M/IO : Differentiate between the Memory and I/O operation. A LOW on this pin indicated I/O  operation and a HIGH indicated a Memory Operation  HOLD : The 8086 has a pin called HOLD. This pin is used by external devices to gain control of  the busses.  HLDA :  When the HOLD signal is activated by an external device, the 8086 stops executing instructions  and stops using the busses. This would allow external devices to control the information on the  8086 MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM MODES of operation  MN/MX  ? Minimum mode The 8086 processor works in a single processor environment.  All control signals for memory and I/O are generated by the microprocessor.  ? Maximum mode is designed to be used when a coprocessor exists in the system.  ? 8086 works in a multiprocessor environment. Control signals for memory and  I/O are generated by an external BUS Controller.

You also get an internet phone for free with very cheap overseas calls. I've never had broadband through any other provider so cannot really give you a true comparison.  Yahoo with BT is just something that comes with BT. You can have BT broadband and never come to this site or use the mail service!|`|DHGC7BXQaa	If cable/virgin is available then go with that.

2SSA9e9Naa	The only thing I've heard of is usb keyboards that have usb ports, basically a USB hub. You would have to have USB headphones for that to work. The system recognizes the UBS headphones and passes the signal on. The keyboard doesn't really know it has a set of headphones connected.    For a keyboad to support regular headphones:      a) it would have to have a sound card in it (not practical), or      b) it would have to connect to your sound card. I've never heard of a keyboard that does that.    Make sense?

When I build systems for clients, even if all they want is a very basic system, I try to steer them away from Celeron and AMD Sempron processors, in most situations you can get a current line mainstream processor for almost the same price, and in the long run you will be much happier.    Example pricing:    Intel 440 Celeron 2ghz Single Core Processor: $40    Intel E1400 Celeron 2ghz Dual Core Processor: $50  Intel E2200 Pentium 2.2ghz Dual Core Processor: $60  Intel E7400 Core 2 Duo 2.8ghz Dual Core Processor: $120    All these processors are 775 pin processors and even so I still would sway a clients decision away from either the Intel 440 or the E1400 simply for performance and compatibility issues.|`|lKNQh60Oaa	No, price can tell you that. ;]|`|dXZOTXaFaa	no . pentium is way more powerful but i do not recommend either (maybe pentium a little) but i do recommend core2 processors. they are the closest to the best that intel has. and dont get amd.
OlfVNTuYaa	There's a good chance your computer is infested with spyware. My advise: get copies of Adaware and/or Spybot Search and Destroy (they're both free off of download.com), and make sure that isn't the issue.    If you're still having issues and there was no spyware found, try reinstalling the Google search bar.

SJM0rzHtaa	The best way to eliminate the noise is to buy an aftermarket VGA cooler.    I recommend either the Zalman VF700 or the VF900.  These VGA card heatsinks use larger-diameter fans so they can spin slower (and thus quieter) while moving the same amount of air as a smaller, faster (and noisier) fan.    They also come with fan controllers which you can use to adjust the fan speed.    Hope this helps.    EDITED TO ADD:    The Zalmans I mentioned above ARE fans for cooling the graphics card, and are designed to do so quietly.  They are NOT case fans.  You replace the stock heatsink/fan on the graphics card with these.|`|nWgtperhaa	if evga brand:  try downloading evga precision off the evga website. then you can control fan speed with that.  if not evga:  sorry, i dunno|`|fUF1UIZbaa	If you have the money, get a better cooler, try places like frozencpu.com .|`|j1gdd5GQaa	I have an XFX 9600 GT, which is very similar, and the fan is very loud if the drivers aren't installed. Make sure you install the drivers that you can find on the CD. If you lost the CD then look for the drivers on the official XFX website.    If none of this helps your best bet would be to contact XFX.

uuDloQnCaa	How to remove Fake Software, Pop-Ups, Spyware, Trojans and Viruses:    Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete what ever they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)|`|dkpIjt5jaa	This is Malware, deeply rooting itself in your system (some even hide in your router's firmware). Virus scanners and the Restore Point Utility are not good things to use against such invasion for this reason alone.    Get the programs I listed from another computer (Internet Caf, Public Library or friend's computer) onto a USB stick as Malware blocks you from downloading protection. A word of caution, be sure to read all programs help files completely before using them. If you still cannot use MBAM,  rename it Alteregobytes to confuse the Malware (but be sure to keep the .exe extension on it) and use it as alternative for part A of the following solution.     Trying MBAM alone is not enough as you need a COMPLETE solution, here is one (use programs in the order stated):     A) Download MBAM (MalwareBytes' Anti-Malware): http://www.download.com/Malwarebytes-Ant... - Install the application and make sure a checkmark is placed next to Update Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware and Launch Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware, then click Finish ( If an update is found, it will download and install the latest version ).    Once the program has loaded, select "Perform Quick Scan", then click Scan ( The scan may take some time,so please be patient ). When the scan is complete, click OK, then Show Results to view the results. Make sure that everything is checked, and click Remove Selected ( When disinfection is completed, a log will open in Notepad and you may be prompted to Restart ).      B) Try the tricks and free programs I use: 1) Flush accumulated junk in browsers. Browsers keep information about your activities and you should delete it.     Method One (now): In Internet Explorer (IE), click the Tools menu, then Delete Browsing History and in the box, click the Delete all button (bottom left) and Yes.  In Firefox (FF), go to tools, clear private data, make sure all boxes are checked and then click on the clear private data now button.    Method Two (Normal use: Every 14 days - Heavy use: Every 7 days): In IE, click the Tools menu, Delete Browsing History and in the box that opens, do these: a) click the button near Temporary Internet Files, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close.   b) click the button near History, click Yes and wait for the box that opens to close and finally, click the close button (bottom right) to finish.    In FF, Go to tools, clear private data and uncheck all except Browsing History, Cache and Authenticated Sessions boxes then click on the clear private data now button.    Note: Close browser when done to clear cookies still in memory.  For other browsers or versions of the programs, check help files for guidance on doing cleanup.    2) Turn off the restore point utility ( Guide for XP: http://support.microsoft.com/kb/310405 and Vista: http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows... )    3) Use this free cleaner: http://www.glaryutilities.com/gu.html to remove junk and remnants files.    4) put order in your HD with a "Disk defragmenter".    5) Turn restore point utility back on. (see part 2)    6) Do not use Google/Yahoo toolbars (spyware).    7) Persisting problem after this, get Avira: http://www.download.com/Avira-AntiVir-Pe... plus an Email scanner ( http://www.spamdel.com/ OR http://www.glenn.delahoy.com/software/fi... ).  Already have a scanner, make sure your virus database is updated BUT stay away from (or get rid of) AVG free (CRAP).    8) If the problem is very stubborn and you have a router, visit its web site and check for firmware that is more recent than your version. If FOUND, download and install, if NOT, use the router's reset switch, both methods return it to factory settings. "WARNING": Gather router install CDs, guides, passwords before doing this as you will need to do all connections again.      By doing so, you are on your way to being well protected BUT never relax your guard !|`|eg9wjUQ7aa	http://www.malwarebytes.org/malwarenet.p...  I've never heard of it.

Download, install, update and scan your computer with both Malwarebytes and SuperantiSpyware, delete what ever they find, if this fails to completely remove the virus/spyware download then update Avast and run a boot scan (click schedule boot-time scan and restart your PC), all the software below is free and safe to use.    Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    SuperantiSpyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/    Avast Anti-Virus: http://www.avast.com/eng/avast_4_home.ht...    To protect your PC in the future you'll need to install anti-virus software and a firewall, id recommend using Avast and Comodo Pro firewall both are very effective and completely free, you should also switch to Firefox 3 if you are browsing with IE as its much safer and a lot easier to use. (links on my profile)|`|FBQZ06vraa	Try running AVG in Safe Mode.  Safe Mode often prevents malware from protecting itself.    I suggest you also download Ad-Aware 2008 and Spybot S&D (theyre free), install them, update them and run them. If any of the above (or any anti-malware, for that matter) doesnt seem to be able to run properly or get rid of everything it reports finding, try running it again in Safe Mode.     Also, turn off System Restore to evict any copies of bad stuff that might be lurking there.      To get into Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking:    1. Log out and reboot your machine.  2. When the machine starts the reboot sequence, press the F8 key repeatedly.  3. Select Safe Mode or Safe Mode with Networking from the resulting menu.  4. Login.  If the malware has changed your password, try logging in as Administrator.  By default, Administrator has no password.  5. The machine will continue booting, but the Windows desktop will look different.    6. When you're finished doing what you need to do, log out and reboot back into normal mode.    Note that even if the anti-malware programs get rid of the malware, they may not be able to reverse the effects.  Search the Web for possible fixes.    Update and run everything regularly, not just when you think you already have malware.    Good luck.|`|PClDWT8zaa	Dude avg??

After you are ABSOLUTELY SURE that you have saved everything you would like to save (this will destroy all data on your disk), put in the Windows CD and boot up from CD ROM. Format the C drive and reinstall Windows. Follow the directions on the screen. The installation will ask you how you want to partition your disk. If you are installing Windows 95, 98, or ME, select either FAT16 or FAT32, if you are running Windows 2000, XP, or Vista, select NTFS or FAT. When it is done installing, copy the files you saved to your hard disk, and reinstall all of the programs you had running.|`|jnbHDOmVaa	You could also try restoring your computer to an earlier date. If those don't work (it should :) ), then you should do a system recovery using the CD that came with your computer. You actually might not even have a virus. It might just need a simple pop-up blocker. It also depends on if you are using the unpaid download of avg or the paid. The paid one is the only one that will take the virus off.
5dYrLs45aa	Antivirus 2009 (or 2008, or Antivirus XP2009 or Antivirus 360 or SmitFraud or dozens of other names - there are many clones of this rogue software) is a piece of malware that infects your computer and constantly pops up notices that you have an infection and you have to buy or update Antivirus 2009. This is a scam to trick you into paying $30 for some useless software.  The malware installed when you downloaded something from the web, sometimes masquerading as a video codec or other useful software. It is persistent, and infects a number of Windows files.    It is too clever to just delete it or add/remove it. It may even block your Task Manager and block Internet access to antivirus sites.    First download the following (if the virus is blocking your internet, you may have to download these on another machine and burn to CD or copy to a USB memory stick)     Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    Superantispyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...    CCleaner (cleans out caches)  http://www.ccleaner.com    Avast! 4 Home: http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...    Now, start the machine in Safe Mode (hit the F8 function key as the machine boots up, and choose Safe mode)    Turn off System Restore on your machine, but only until you get this fixed - many of these trojans get copied into the System Restore files, which anti-virus programs aren't allowed to touch and the viruse could reinstall themselves from there. My Computer > Properties > System Restore.    Then run CCleaner (it'll make scanning faster because it will delete a bunch of temp files and save you from having to scan those.)    Then run Malwarebytes, and clean everything it says.    Then in stall and run Avast - tell Avast to do a boot-scan - click on "schedule boot-scan" - and restart the computer    Let it start and do the Avast boot scan    Then install and run Superantispyware    Then turn System Restore back on.    Now install the antivirus program and antispyware program of your choice to do continuous scanning, and make sure you keep it up to date.     Always keep your Windows, web browser and Java software up to date - frequent patches are released to plug security holes.   http://www.pcworld.com/article/149298/10...

XsIuoM6daa	If it was just a DSL modem (as opposed to a combo modem/router) and you had/have a separate router then no. The DSL modem is a fairly dumb device and only has configuration info stored in it. That would have been set by your DSL service provider.     A router stores a little bit more information, but usually nothing that is personally identifiable. It may have had your account name (which may or may not be your name) and your password. If you still use the same DSL provider (and the same user name and password), I would urge you to change that password. Also, I would not reuse the same router password (i.e., the password that allows access to the router's configuration pages) on your new router.     Neither device stores names, passwords, credit card numbers or the like. They buffer such information as it is being sent over the Internet and generally that is encrypted when it is buffered. All the buffers are lost when the unit is powered down.|`|486709a2335c14c7c109577d3a21258faa	Hola, no, no guarda tu informacin.

IGJGUfjNaa	There a several reasons why your computer is freezing. First question is when was the last time you cleaned your registry. Having a corrupted registry can cause a whole host of errors and problems. Freezing up is one of them. If you have a lot of unnecessary registry keys that are hogging up your computer resources. Your computer is bound to choke. Scan your registry with a good registry cleaner. If you pull up more than 20 errors or duplication, clean your registry.    2. Depending on your RAM specs and your computer usage. This could also be a the issue. Having an insufficient amount of free space does not allow your RAM to function properly. If you are using a lot of RAM by net surfing or other activities without enough empty space your will get freezes. You don't need to buy new RAM but you should increase your free space by removing unnecessary data and perhaps increasing your virtual memory. The below link will show you how.     3. Spyware could be the culprit, so do a scan and see if your computer is infected.       4. Another area is a hardware drivers. This could be the problem if new hardware has been added to the system. So, the drivers should still be up to date. So try the first two suggestion and see if you can get your computer to stop freezing.  Check your drivers.     5. Lastly, check the dust buildup on the fan to make sure you system is cooling properly    http://www.delete-computer-history.com/f...|`|xdlsGvldaa	First and most important back up any and all files you do not want to loose in case of a hard drive crash/failure. This should always be done on a regular schedule just in case this ever happens. At some point and no one can tell ahead you will have a hard drive fail. Now to the problem, after backing up your files, picture any thing of importance to you do a system defragement and disc clean up from start, accessories system tools. Do a system repair from your recovery CD's. Buy and always use a lap top cooling pad with built in fans, this helps cool the lap top and prolong its life as heat is the enemy of electronics. Make sure the intake vent and exhaust vents are clear/clean and not blocked. If you can determine which drive is giving the problem and non of the above fixes it then replace the bad hard drive or both hard drives at same time then install the OS from the recovery Cd's and you have a new clean OS.  Hope this helps|`|eg9wjUQ7aa	If i were you i would try and defragment your drive. I had this problem, but it was with a svchost.exe. It sounds like maybe your computer is just looking all over the place for files it needs to run certain applications etc.|`|2YsKHSpkaa	Ok lets start with random freezes. Laptops are notorious for heating up. The fan that cools the CPU may be blocked with hair or whatever. When this airflow is blocked the CPU heats up and the computer has an automatic shutdown.    Try blowing out the fan with some compressed air and see what comes out of it.    As far as the consistencies.    Windows has a feature built in where if your computer does a hard shutdown. Such as you hitting the power button and not going to start and shutdown.    the next time the computer boots it runs what we call a scandisk. BNasically all it is doing is checking to see if any files or any of your HDD has become corrupt with bad sectors. A hard shutdown is not good for a computer.    Hope it helps|`|JgfqdAENaa	4 things to try    1) stop all programs running in background (Start/Run) type in "msconfig" enter. when new screen appears go to "startup" and untick all except for anti-virus and firewall. then reboot    2) remove all panel under laptop and blow out using a can of compressed air (radio Shack)    3) download "Malwarebytes" install and update it then run in safe mode  then restart    4) go to C:\drive right click and go to properties when properties opens go to tools and error checking Check now new box tick little box to fix errors and reboot Windows will on reboot scan disk and fix any errors then restart

1ZG6ZmxKaa	best buy & HP or Dell|`|x3istER1aa	tigerdirect.com|`|UV8bN0Giaa	You can't go wrong and I personally recommend Dell! There are hidden long-run costs that one does not initially see when you purchase a Notebook PC other than Dell, HP or IBM and later encounter difficulties or attempt buying replacement parts like a battery, or say a keyboard etc.    Also if you're buying for college then I do NOT recommend a Notebook PC bigger than 15.4" bec we have 3 DELLs incl a larger 17" Notebook PC and the larger ones are nice but much too heavy to lug around campus as well as too big for lecture hall desks in college...     I mentioned we own 3 Dell Notebook PCs and why I recommend DELL, HP or IBM for those living in the United States is that those 3 particular PC Notebook manufacturers literally supply all the business Notebook PCs to the major corporations and Government so replacement parts are readily available esp on EBAY at even a more reasonable price than the manufacturer website. Thus in the long run, being able to get the exact replacement part extends the life on your investment.    FYI my 1st Notebook PC was Gateway bec I couldn't afford Dell at the time and what a mistake is was when I needed to purchase a new Notebook battery     Note if you are looking for DELL bargains, then visit their DELL OUTLET site...    http://www.dell.com/outlet    Hope Above Info Helps!|`|7Grez2cmaa	It really depends on what you need so if you need gaming go to cyberpowerpc, if your into entertainment or adobe go sony, if your just the guy looking for a cheap buy for just word and the internet go to new egg or tigerdirect or pricgrabber.

This is a scam to trick you into paying $30 for some useless software.  The malware installed when you downloaded something from the web, sometimes masquerading as a video codec or other useful software. It is persistent, and infects a number of Windows files.    It is too clever to just delete it or add/remove it. It may even block your Task Manager and block Internet access to antivirus sites.    First download the following (if the virus is blocking your internet, you may have to download these on another machine and burn to CD or copy to a USB memory stick)     Malwarebytes: http://www.malwarebytes.org/mbam.php    Superantispyware: http://www.superantispyware.com/superant...    CCleaner (cleans out caches)  http://www.ccleaner.com    Avast! 4 Home: http://www.avast.com/eng/download-avast-...    Now, start the machine in Safe Mode (hit the F8 function key as the machine boots up, and choose Safe mode)    Turn off System Restore on your machine, but only until you get this fixed - many of these trojans get copied into the System Restore files, which anti-virus programs aren't allowed to touch and the viruse could reinstall themselves from there. My Computer > Properties > System Restore.    Then run CCleaner (it'll make scanning faster because it will delete a bunch of temp files and save you from having to scan those.)    Then run Malwarebytes, and clean everything it says.    Then in stall and run Avast - tell Avast to do a boot-scan - click on "schedule boot-scan" - and restart the computer    Let it start and do the Avast boot scan    Then install and run Superantispyware    Then turn System Restore back on.    Now install the antivirus program and antispyware program of your choice to do continuous scanning, and make sure you keep it up to date.     Always keep your Windows, web browser and Java software up to date - frequent patches are released to plug security holes.   http://www.pcworld.com/article/149298/10...

vAwzvNgzaa	Go into tools menu at the top of your browser Select options Select the content tab and check the box that says enable java script.|`|zorYTX59aa	If your YouTube is getting bombarded with "JavaScript" and   "Flash Player" messages, and people are telling you to get  or install something, DON'T TOUCH A THING.    You will get absolutely nowhere messing around with "Java",   "Flash" or various web browsers -- and definitely stay away  from software that salespeople (disguised as answerers on  Yahoo) are trying to "sucker" you into buying.    None of those things will help you, because your computer   and YouTube were working perfectly fine a while ago, right?   The first rule-of-thumb and best option should ALWAYS be:  don't disable, erase, uninstall, switch, download, alter, add,   change or install anything. That'll only make matters worse.    I'm 100% positive both your "JavaScript" and "Flash Player"  are fine. Nothing about watching YouTube videos has really  changed in the past couple of years. If anything, the newer  Flash Players have been known to give many YouTubers a   lot of trouble, especially all 5 variations of version 10. (Why   in the world is there a 10.0.525, 10.1.218, 10.2.26, 10.2.54  and 10.12.36? The only thing that most upgrades are good   for is their potential to create all kinds of software conflicts).    Your problem may fix itself within a couple hours, or by the  next day, because YouTube often "shuts down" a bunch of  their own servers every single day without warning anybody,   in order to update all kinds of stuff. During those occasions,   it is actually YouTube's data transmissions of "Java" and/or   "Flash" that are poor -- not yours.    If the following day your YouTube is still stuck and showing   you those awful "JavaScript" and "Flash Player" messages,   it is possible that your subdirectories of "temporary internet   files" and memory (many times called "cache") are entirely  maxxed out and cannot take anymore, the end result being  that YouTube videos cannot even make it onto your screen.    "Temporary internet files" are tiny bits of webpages that get   permanently put on your computer's hard-drive. They'll stay   there forever and ever, gradually plugging up your computer   much like hair slowly clogs a sink drain, until you get rid of   them. The solution to that is to clear your "cache" of all the   "TIFs" as well as your "cookies" and "history". Then reboot.    Note 1: if you've got Google Web Accelerator or something  similar to it...dump it, burn it, trash it, disable it, uninstall it;   do all you can to get rid of it -- even though this contradicts   my advice uptop. GWA conflicts with YouTube. Clicking on  "Don't Accelerate This Website" won't help you whatsoever.   (Some downloaders and converters also ruin YouTube too.)    Note 2: longer videos only require "Flash" and "Shockwave"  in order to play smooth. Other than that, avoid all the sales   pitches that some Yahooers are shilling, because they are   really disguised salespeople and peddlers. Their "answers"   have nothing to do with your problem, and their wares may  worsen your problem. Besides, what kind of selfish answer   is that? [my paraphrase] "Although you cannot even watch   or access videos, buy our downloader."    Note 3: a very odd fix that once worked for me was altering  the URL from "www.youtube.com" to simply "youtube.com"  (or you could even try "ca.youtube.com").|`|iRZBm8vgaa	YOU CANT TURN IT ON...
