20090129104302AAMUwlV	Travel;Air Travel	A question about American flight attendants....?	So I've noticed that airplane companies in other countries hire flight attendants who are extremly beautiful (I passed by a group of attendants from Air Korea and my eyes almost melted from how amazingly pretty they were),      but the aircompanies in America don't really do this. I mean, I'm not saying American flight attendants are ugly (because they're not), but it seems to me (from experience only) that they're hired more for they're AMAZING personalities than for their looks (they were so nice and so incredibly funny on my last domestic flight).      So, is this really true? Do the American companies have different criteria for hiring flight attendants?

20090128085008AAngRcJ	Travel;United States;Other - United States	Question for experienced long-distance hitchhikers only please!!?	Looking for one (several is always better) person(s) to pose questions to before i undertake my Eastern USA hitchhiking tour this summer. I have experience myself, and have had very good success, and enjoy it greatly. Just want to ask a lot of questions, specific little things, hear some different opinions. Email would be much better, so one persons answers are not tainted by anothers, cause i want to here lots of differing views on each question. If there is no other way to talk than this would be ok, but only as a last resort.    I realize that means a risk on all your parts, opening up and email address to me, or whatever other way you may come up with, and, which is why i am just asking please. Also useful would be websites entirely devoted to the subject, books, magazines? anything. thank you very much.

Do they release them at a certain time of day? Should I call morning and evening just to make sure I'm covered?
