Oi pessoal      Estou escrevendo apenas para agradecer as muitas pessoas que responderam as perguntas que fiz aqui a respeito da situa?ao pela qual estou passando. Agrade?o em especial aqueles que responderam movidos pelo intento de realmente ajudar com conselhos positivos e sensatos.      Infelizmente nao consegui voltar para a casa do papai pois ele nao me aceita mais e nao quis nem conversar comigo, portanto nao me resta outra alternativa a nao ser continuar a trabalhar fazendo strip tease e programas com homens. Pretendo com isso ganhar bastante dinheiro nos próximos anos e partir para um lance completamente diferente quando tiver condi?oes financeiras para tal. Apesar das minhas atividades nao vou parar de estudar; pretendo concluir normalmente o segundo grau e mais tarde entrar para a faculdade.      Mais uma vez muito obrigada a todos.

But before we where going out we where really good friends, really close friends and we had like this way of showing it and over the weekend she never used it but the last few days she did. But when we talked yesterday i felt like she was letting me back into her you know. But i don't know where i stand, i mean i really love this girl, everything about her. Although i love her as a great friend my feelings lie elsewhere. I want her as my gf. I just don't know what to do. But i don't want her to be like i need you here all the time, i want her to be committed and when i am there she will be happy. I like other girls but the one i love is her and i can't kid myself.

A cachorrinha sofre de "alergia cr?nica". Já procuramos vários veterinários e a cachorrinha já passou por vários tratamentos. Foi feita uma esterectomia e ela está tomando vacinas, mas o quadro só piora e, de vez em quando, ela  uiva como se tivesse sido espetada. A última sugest?o do veterinário é fazer um exame para verifica??o de alguma coisa no fígado e, caso se confirme, só o medicamento custa +/- R$ 1.000 e dá para 6 meses.

20070328133820AAkNLxP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Terminei namoro-pai da minha namorada me odiava?	Namorei uma mulher por sete anos, 13 anos mais velha que eu, eu tenho 28 e ela 41, já fez 42.      Terminei com ela em novembro de 2006, pois n?o aguentava a situa??o humilhante, ela mora com os pais, o pai dela era contra nosso namoro, pois ela é mais velha que eu, ela conversou com o pai dela, era continuou irredutível, me proibia de entrar na casa deles, eu ficava na portaria do prédio, até os porteiros sabiam disso, meus pais nunca se oporam ao nosso namoro.      Cheguei até a convidá-la para morar comigo, mas ela come?ou a inventar mil desculpas.      Ent?o n?o quis mais permanecer nesta situa??o ridícula, pois posso arranjar outra garota ( na época apareceu uma, mas foi uma furada)que n?o me fa?a passar por isso, eu sou advogado, n?o sou bandido e vagabundo.      Vcs acham que eu agi corretamente?  Ou fui radical?      Ela me chamou de "moleque", há alguns dias atrás,mas moleque n?o chama namorada para morar junto, n?o é?      abra?os      Cristiano.

Eu gosto de um primo e sei que ele também gosta de mim, somos primos de 2o grau, mas ainda n?o rolou nada entre a gente pois temos medo de muitas coisas. Sabemos se come?armos algo serio, provavelmente vamos se apaixonar e virar coisa seria. Nosso medo é o termo de sermos crist?os e a igreja proibe isso, respeitamos isso. E também pelo fato da genética, imagine se o negocio vai mais fundo e casamos.....filhos....   Temos essa duvida, por favor se alguem souber esclarecer.

20090428071410AAZZQPX	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	This girl that I had feelings for just randomly ended the emotions we had for each other after 6 months.?	This girl that I met through a friend last year told me in december that she had feelings for me, and I fell for her and we started hanging out almost every weekend since then.       We would go out to movies, go to each others houses and go clubbing together with her and my friends, we used to visit each others houses and just enjoy each others company, she told me in the summer that she wanted to be with me but that she was a ''confused'' girl and didn't know what she wants, so I tried and gave my heart and soul to try and create a relationship between us, and she kept me hanging for 6 MONTHS!! I would pay for her movie tickets, take her shopping, I would buy her her favorite albums, take her out for dinner and get her a rose , I even took her out on valentines day and bought her a valentines gift bag to show her what I would do for her if we were to be in a relationship because we clicked so much and had so many interests that were the same.       There was one incident at a party where she got drunk and made out with this random guy which really pissed me off, I couldnt handle it and her friends came to speak to me at the party to tell me it wasnt like her. The next day she phoned me to apologize but I only forgave her a few days later. After that we never had the same kind of bond between us like before and I just couldnt trust her the way I did.       Recently everything came to a halt when she told me she doesnt know where her feelings for me had disappeared to and I even asked her if she liked another guy or if it was something I done to make her not like me anymore, I was extremely heartbroken. Then I found out she likes this other guy that I know who DJ'd at her party recently (HE DOESNT EVEN LIVE CLOSE BY).       Even after she told me she liked nobody else it stumped me because i did so much for her because all her ex's dumped her before and I wanted to be that DIFFERENT GUY, and the guy that she's going out with now isnt boyfriend material.       I don't know why she would just end things like that even though she likes this other guy now, but after 6 MONTHS , she only met this guy over the past few weeks!! It would be appreciated if I could have a girls perspective :) , and would she ever come back after realizing of all the good stuff I did for her ?? Her friends even told me they would go out with me because im such a ''good guy'' haha.
20060614134619AAcvp4l	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What is up with this girl?	Here's the thing.

That was like 6 months ago, and when I've seen her, we haven't like really talked, and she just used to ignore me. Now I have a girlfriend, whose one of her friends, and everytime she sees me, she starts a conversation, and we talk loads... I'm confused! We were really good friends before, should we become friends again, even though she didn't talk to me for months?

I sat down and talked to her and she told me that it would not bother her in any way what so ever if i were to go out with him and she gave me her blessing. We were on terms at "Hey." for a while, but we started talking and we have become ok friends. We chat on myspace and at church a little bit. He lives in the neighboring town. Well the only thing is we are still at the friends stage. How do I get to know him better and get him to notice me? I don't want to rush but I am really eager to get closer to him. I am sixteen and I have never so much as held a boys hand. Since I am new at this I have no idea what to do! And I don't want to embarrass myself. Can someone please help me out here?!

There's this guy... i got friendly with him after me and a friend crashed at his place. I shared a bed with him and we stayed up all night talking and i told him i was fed up of guys using me for sex and all that and he didn't try anything on and we got on really well.   Spend the whole of the next day with him just flirting and messing around.  Stayed at his a few nights later and all we did was kiss.  Next night i got back from a party and had been drinking and i was telling him im not looking for a relationship but miss the sex.... well one thing led to another and have slept with each other .. and have done about 4 times.  He always told me he hates girls that get emotionally attached to him and text him pointless things. (i know he's slept with a lot of people and there all mostly one night stands that he barely has conversation with)  So i decided i wouldn't text him because i didn't want to look desperate.  Now its been a few weeks, we speak now and then but now im starting to fall for him. What should i do?    Please help
20090203134413AA2yuMl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Would it be weird if I did this for him?	...send him a Valentine's goodie basket at work on the Friday before V-Day? He is super busy at work and hardly ever gets to go out, so it might be nice to have some snacks at his desk. Also, two of his co-workers are also his roommates, who I know and like.      The catch is, we've only been "talking" for like, a month. We have no plans (yet) for V-Day and haven't even had a relationship talk. I just really like him. I don't know if he's getting me anything... I just want to do this to let him know I like him. I'm 23 and he is 29.

20090203122652AABK6Ul	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Someone please help me! Please!?	I have a small town business here in New Hampshire. It's a convenience store, basically, I'm trying to sell pregnancy tests in my store. I want to sell First response pregnancy tests, because they seem to be the best on the market test to buy after some research. I called Church and Dwight directly, and they have a minimum $3000 order which would give me about 1500 boxes of pregnancy tests. I don't have the space for all of that. Does anyone know of some of Church and Dwight's distributors where I could get far less but for the same price. I'm looking to spend about 2.00 on a box of two. Maybe a little more. Thank you

Don't judge please. We have recently become friends (about a month and half ago) We get along superbly and we have tons in common. He's kind of shy and quirky. He's adorable and I like him so much! Like, I might even love him! But, he has a girlfriend. Recently, I heard from my friend that his friend told him that they are having "relationship issues" or some fighting, idk, and his friend said "personally i think it's because jake talks to this girl all the time and he gave her a ride home and hes flirting with her and stuff." I don't know if thats the exact words or if its even true, but that fit the description of me. I really want him to ask me out or even just kiss me. His older sister in college is friends with my older sister in college and we're both going to London in april. (just both happened to be going). we are in the school production together and i really want him to like me! I'm really not trying to be a homewrecker, it's just I really really really like him. I don't know if I should even tell him? that might be bad. we talk almost everyday on FB. i want him to feel the same way about me. HELP WHAT SHOULD I DO???? im so confused and frustrated. I usually initiate conversation on FB. I want him to. I'm really sad and angry he probably really likes his girlfriend. Life is so unfair. it's hard not to be love. is it too early to tell him or something? how to get him to like me?? oh and today he said hi to me.

When she told me about herself I said, "that's exactly what I like in a girl" because it was, and she grinned from ear to ear and turned bright red and did the same thing when I told her she had beautiful eyes.       Before we left she put her number in my phone and told me to text first because she doesn't pick up unknown numbers.      What is something that will grab her attention and make her smile? I want something cute and flirty... not just something she's going to ignore and delete.

20090203133626AAc6HTw	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is he running scared because of our anniversary and Valentine's Day?	My bf & I are coming up on our one year anniversary in about a month.  We are long distance (about 4 hours) and have been from the start.  I’m looking for a job in his city (he lives in a much bigger city) so that we can be together.  We’re both in our late 20s, so it’s not like we’re kids here.          He’s been acting weird lately, almost like he’s about to end it.  Last weekend though, he practically begged me to come visit cause we hadn’t seen each other in a few weeks and he couldn’t come here because of other commitments.  And now that I’m back at home, he seems very distant.  Yet, our weekend was great as far as I can tell.      I know he’s getting pressure from his family and friends to propose.  We’ve talked about it and he’s already told me that he’s not ready and I’ve reassured him that I’m okay with that (and I really am).  He’s not getting any pressure from me, just his family & friends.      I can’t help but wonder whether he’s feeling the pressure because we’re coming up on a year and it’s almost Valentine’s Day and he’s trying to keep a low profile.  Or maybe he really is just second guessing our relationship and I’m trying to find lame excuses for why he’s quiet lately.  Or maybe I’m just being a girl and reading way too much into this! lol      I am going there again this weekend and he's coming here the following weekend for Valentine's Day, so I’m hoping that everything will be back to normal.  In the meantime though, does anyone have any ideas?
20090203121113AA8cHFw	Family & Relationships;Family	What should I add to my brother's letter?	My brother is at basic right now. I got a letter from him yesterday. It was the first letter where we actually got an address to write him back. He seems really down and depressed. I am writing a letter for him right now to cheer him up. I need some ideas of what to send him. I know I can not send anything other than paper. I have decided to send military jokes, hoping that would cheer him up some. Do you guys have any ideas of what I could send him? If you have been in basic, what would you have really liked to get information on or told about? I plan on also letting him know who won the superbowl. I am hoping sending information about home and giving him tons of supports and lots of "You can do this, your strong!" will help him out some.   Thanks for any ideas you have to offer! =)

20090203120009AACtqjs	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My girlfriend has some different requests.?	My girlfriend and I have a pretty good sex life. Lately we have become more experimental and we really want to please the other person. Well she had heard that when giving oral to a guy, if a woman takes their finger and inserts it in the guys rear while performing oral it will enhance the guys orgasm. Now I am open to a lot of things, but she has said she wants to do that to see how I like it. I keep debating it and don't know exactly what to do. I am not against it or for it, I just havent ever been asked that before.       Now I am sure some of you will post some dumb replies, but Ladies have you ever done that to your guy? What do you all think about this?? Thanks

20090203131402AAN3pFu	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why didn't my dream guy ask me about it? I am so in love with him deeply. He is quiet but hot...?	Well we both had a crush on each other since we met each other. Well we did not start talking to each other yet. I wanted to start the conversation with him in school but never got an opportunity since both of us are shy. Well I always give a try being alone, no friend's of mines knowing the matter. He never gives a try though.      I gave his friend my e-mail ad to give it to him, my friend actually gave the paper to one of his friend. He never mailed me during the holidays. Then I thought he would ask me when school starts, but he didn't. Everytime he sees me he just keeps smiling. Sometimes I get angry, but I can't get him out of my head. Why is he not asking me about it? When it comes to conversation, we are both shy to communicate. He is 19, and isn't he supposed to be able to stand up since he knows I like him and the rest lies upon him talking to me right? What do you think?      Thanks.
20090203120625AAA801b	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How can I let him know that I want love?	Without sounding clingy? I know he likes me a lot. I have all the right signs, and when we first started talking and he brought up love, I told him I didn't want to say "love" just cause I didn't want to get in too deep. He still tried by saying "love ya" and stuff.. but I never took the bait cause I just always feel that guys say it because they think it's what you need to hear, and not what they really care about?      Well now after sleeping together 4 times without any mention of love, I want it somehow. I am not clingy at all, but how can I tell him I want to feel more love from him? thanks

I love this poem, but I'm not sure if what the speaker said is true ( nothing and no one is single, everyone belongs to someone) ! I USED to find what he stated right, but NOT anymore =[   Anyway, here's the beautiful poem ..      Love's Philosophy   Percy Bysshe Shelley         The fountains mingle with the river,   And the rivers with the ocean;   The winds of heaven mix forever   With a sweet emotion;   Nothing in the world is single;   All things by a law divine   In another's being mingle--   Why not I with thine?      See, the mountains kiss high heaven,   And the waves clasp one another;   No sister flower could be forgiven   If it disdained its brother;   And the sunlight clasps the earth,   And the moonbeams kiss the sea;--   What are all these kissings worth,   If thou kiss not me?            '' Nothing in the world is single;   All things by a law divine   In another's being mingle--'' << What's YOUR own view ?      Thanks in advance.

20090203131230AANIVPr	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Thought I'd got over him :( Why do I feel like this?	I split up with the man I was seeing for six months at the beginning of January. I had known him for 10 years, and we'd be involved in a relationship in the past (we're in our twenties now).      It was always him calling the shots, and he decided after a lot of ons and offs that he couldn't commit to a relationship.      I was head over heels and was devastated at first, but the last couple weeks felt a lot better, and thought I'd nearly got over it all.      Just since the weekend though, I've been thinking about him loads, and tried ringing him and have text him, and keep worrying he's with someone else for some reason (I have no reason to think this!).      Why does this happen, I don't want to take two steps forward and five back :( it's really getting me down, because I've done all the right things to get over him, like no contact, spending time with mates, hobbies etc etc, and just feel rubbish over it all of a sudden.       I've text him tonight for some stupid reason when I had been so good about not doing it for about three weeks. I am annoyed at myself. Why have I gone backwards like this, and what can I do?      Thanks :)

20090203130104AAUud4E	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How many women are turned on by being dominated?	I realize that this question sounds a bit sexist, but I've found almost invariably that women are turned on by being dominated. Maybe it's just me - I'm 6'3", 245, and bald - but the more violent and aggressive I acted in bed, the more women loved it. I found that, regardless if the female was 4'11" or 6'5" (I've dated both), the recipe for turning them on could be broken up into:    1) Hold them down firmly by the wrists...apply enough pressure to hurt them slightly, yet not to cause serious pain.    2) Thrust as hard as you can.    3) While doing so, mouth in an angry, aggressive tone things like "Yeah, you like this, don't you?" and "Come on, beg for it".    I admit, I'm less than thrilled by the whole procedure...while some men get off on dominating someone, I find it sort of caveman-esque and was a bit disappointed to find that the women were so traditional and stereotypical in what they liked. However, I've posted questions in the past mentioning that I hated my height and build and generally people acted like I was crazy, like almost all women wanted a big man who would "ravage" them.  It's hard for me to reconcile turning someone on with something I totally hate about myself, but there isn't exactly a way for me to alter my height, build, nor baldness.
20090203122610AAcmCR4	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I trust my boyfriend?	My boyfriend is the first person I've dated who I've loved, and I'm itching to leave him. Not because of anything he's done, but because this closeness and self-investment is way beyond my comfort zone, in relationships both friendly and romantic. In short, I'm only comfortable dating and sleeping with people who I'm not in love with.       Has anyone broken past this, and learned to trust? And how on earth do you manage it?
20090203134420AABQI0f	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do you ever feel really ugly when asking someone out?	*READ*   I know the question is weird, but what i mean is,   i don't consider myself Brad pitt, in terms of looks and charms.   My main type of conversation with a girl is sarcasm and trying to make them laugh, so i can be sure that they enjoyed talking to me.   Anyways, im not an ogre or anything, im just average, i get the odd "youre cute"comment from a girl.   but when im gonna ask a girl out, i want to make a good impression,   and i feel like i look totally ugly to the girl when i ask them out.   do you ever get that.   do you get nervous.

20070108094743AA4SFuV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	We got our own place! Now we have privacy but he doesnt seem to want intercourse!?	Me and my bf were having a long distance relationship for the past year and a half. It was getting difficult because we really missed being around eachother so he moved to my state and we got our own apartment.This is a first for both of us. We are both 22 and its our first time away from home. Weve always had to go to hotels and pay crazy amounts of money just to be alone and make love. We moved in on the 29th of december and i swear we've only had sex about 4 times.Trust me thats a very low number for us. Thing is its not me its him. He doesnt really seem interested in sex to much. He goes straight to sleep at night. Its starting to piss me off. I feel that maybe the fact that he knows he has full access to me now is making him not really interested. Maybe before when it was harder to get to me it was more exciting and more of a turn on? What could it be? Yester day i asked him if he wasnt attracted to me anymore..but i asked in a joking way. He got mad that i asked that. What now?

She didn't think he would ever like her and wasn't trying to be more than a friend. She likes him now that he's revealed his interest. How should she feel about his sacrafice? Does he like her just because it was forbidden. The break up was over a yr ago and the guy broke up with her. Do you think this guy likes her b/c he has decided to through caution to the wind and like his roommates ex and he is living on a high from doing something taboo or are his feelings genuine for her? He seems to appreciate a lot of qualities about her.

Hes told me he loves me many times, we are very close. Recently he's been going through problems, and he understandably needs some space. Hes been acting distant since before christmas, and now hes told me why. He says he needs to sort stuff out - mainly family related, and then he will get back in touch when hes ready. I miss him so much, as we used to see each other all the time, and i havent seen or spoken to him in weeks. Im missing him so much. And i know i should wait till he lets me in again - but how long should i give it? this is so hard for me as im going through my own major problems aswell and need to talk and turn to someone for support. i said he had let me down as he hadnt been then and reluctantly hes confessed why, but is still not there for at all. hes clearly going to take more than a few weeks to sort his issues out. how long do i wait or do i wait as long as it takes??

20090203132805AApzTON	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am i overreacting about my boyfriend?? PLEASE READ!!!?	So my boyfriend and his best friend are very close. He lets his best friend help him with his yard work because he doesnt have a job... or a car... so he basically tags along everyday and my bf pays him. Sometimes when they don't have alot of work to do, they go to the mall, or get lunch... It gets really annoying to me, because I could be doing those things with him too. I am doing nothing in the daytime usually because I work at night.. so I get really upset, and I guess jealous. It also bothers me because I will call him, and his friend is ALWAYS with him in the background, so I can never have a serious conversation without him hearing or knowing. Also when I tell my boyfriend things about me or my friends (small things) but tell him not to say anything he tells them!! If I tell my bf things I think about his friends he tells them that too! I have told him that the things bother me, but he makes it seem like I am making a big deal out of nothing.   I understand that guys friends come before girlfriends, and thats fine. But isn't there a line to draw somewhere? I mean we have been together over 2 years, I'm not just 'some girl'.      Am I overreacting or what should I do... I really love him and don't want to break up, but I just don't feel cared about or appreciated.
20090203120759AAkEBuG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Help!!!! Now ex boyfriend problems!!!?	Ok, on saturday my boyfriend and i were talking. He wanted me to send him a pic in my underwear. I didn't want to! So we got in a big fight. Then he's like why are you being like this! I didn't want to send a pic because his friends were there and I didn't know if he just wanted to show off or something! So the fight continued, he called me and was like we need to talk and sort things out and I wouldn't listen. He just wanted to fix our problems. He called me a prude and said i expect too much and don't give anything! I am not a prude and I have never asked him for anything ever! I would call him and he would just forward me. I would text him and he wouldn't reply! So yesterday. I texted him and said ok, next time you come over I will do anything you want me to do. Excluding sex though. Were only 13. So anyway I really like him! I also wouldnt send that pic because it's degrading and slutty! So finally on monday after that text i sent him i said are you still mad at me. He said i don't know! I was like well I'm still kind of mad at you too btw. He sad good! He wouldnt text me again after that! So I was like i dont want to fight anymore. There's no point and it gets no one anywhere! So then i said i cant take it anymore! You don't want to date me. So i guess it's over. Bye. then he said bye. I was crying a lot. I called him on star 6 7 and he answered. I said hey and he hung up! Then i got mad. I said i'm really glad were over. Your an *** hole and I feel bad for whoever dates you! I also said your a perverted ***. Bye. I said it because i was mad. Before we broke up i said sorry a million times! He never said sorry once! Then my sister called him and he's like **** happens. And he said i broke up with him! Ignoring me completely for 2 days is him ending it. And he could say he didnt want to end it! GOD!!!!!!!! I really like him though, and i really don't want it to end. Also I don't do slutty things like that! Please tell me what i should do! I've been crying like crazy! We were like best friends and we know everything about each other! Why is he being like this? Is it my fault?

Guy #1-Asks about me through other people, for example,through my immediate co-worker George, and,through another manager-he asks"So how are you guys doing over there",he says that everytime he talks to my co-worker George, and everyone else for that matter.He's also called up to my job three times,blocking out his number, asking for my whereabouts and told my co-worker that he wanted to meet me, but he never showed.so i called him to chat, we talked for over two hours, and he Told me I can definetly call him anytime. And Every time I see him,he always looks in my eyes, just stares of in space at me,but never speaks.There were two occassions were I was in the office, he did not want to come into the office while I was there which was weird   Guy#2   Mostly talks to me over the phone,very friendly,he told me one time,"Girl don't look at me like that, you'll get me in trouble". He Jokes and laughs with me alot.Used to call me for little things, like schdueling and payroll.Refused to interact with me in person, there was numerous occasions were upper management would ask him to drop off stuff to me,or meet with me to explain something,and he would either make up an excuse,or drop whatever paperwork with another co-worker.The thing is that I've asked this guy if Guy #1 was single or married, so he knows that I sort of have a thing for Guy #1, because they are good friends.So when I call him for overtime,he gives very short answers, or he will not answer my text message.   So The other day, he called up to my job, to say hi to my co-worker George,.and the thing is George has only met this guy twice, so they don't know each other at all really(so I thought that was weird)and he asked him, if he wanted to talk to me, so when I got on the phone with him,.he didn;t really say much, he said he just called to see how we were doing.so it was weird because hes married with kids, and he knows I like Guy #1...so I don't know if he has a thing for me, or Guy #1 does

He's never hurt me. He's never lied to me (that I know of & yes-I've checked his story a few times & he's never lied)  He's done nothing to make me think he's cheating on me-his behavior hasn't changed at all...  I'm paranoid cuz he hired someone to clean his house 1-2 hours/wk when he's @ work (immediately I think cheating).  And the other thing that makes me uneasy is there is a phone number that keeps calling him & it belongs to another woman---I don't know who-and they never talk for long, if he even answers it(maybe 2 times out of 4 or 5 calls).  Am I over-reacting cuz of how I was treated in my previous relationship or do you think he could be cheating? I confronted him last night-told him I keep thinking he's cheating-he said I don't have to worry about another woman & he's not hiding anything. And really, it's ALL cuz of the phone number I saw on his phone and the fact that he hired someone to clean his house(he told me she's married-he say's married cuz she's been with the guy for some time-and that he's kinda friends with the guy).  He's pretty open, too, which makes me think he'd tell me.  Thanks for your help. I'm so worried about this and being pregnant doesn't help!

20090203120832AAbqDgN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I need some advice on relationships..Help?	Okay...    I had a serious relationship that lasted 9 months. The guy i was dating was a year younger than me. I thought the whole world of him. But i saw a different side to him. He got violent with me. And shortly after his birthday he dumped me...    I've always been shy when it comes to relationships, but otherwise I'm a quite outgoing kind of person.     There is one problem with me and that is, is that I have OCD. If a guy touches my bare skin .. say like my stomach or something, I HAVE to go and scrub myself raw. Its a horrible thing and is very painful. I found it hard to lose my virginity because of it.    I'm really insecure with guys now, I want to have a relationship but I'm holding myself back. No matter how much I try. I need some help!
20070423071851AA0Itwl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused by Ex's Actions...Please Advise!?	My ex-bf and I had lived together for 2 years......About 4 months ago, the relationship went sour, due to him allowing his ex-wife to wreck havoc on our relationship.  They would talk to eachother on the phone up to 12 times a day (she was remarried, but going through a divorce), they would have lucnh together, he was visiting her at work..etc....Out of the blue one day he decided that he was not able to give me what I ultimately wanted out of life, A commitment.  He accused me of being paranoid about th erelationship with his ex, however on several occassions, I had found emails he had sent to her saying that he will always love her, and that he should be the one with her blah blah blah.....So, I moved out over a month ago....He stated that he still loved me, but he knew that he couldn't make me happy....Well, since I have left, I have actually met several intersting, emotional available men, that I would like to pursue something with....The ex, however is constantly calling me now.

20090225022430AAjstYk	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls, how do i get the balance between being friendly but not desperate?	Hi, im a 17 year old guy who at the moment is going through some self esteem issues when it comes to girls. Its not in terms of my looks, because when Im walking down the street I always see girls looking at me, Ive kissed girls before, girls speak to me at school, etc, but I know girls look for more than just looks, and what Im worried about is that because id really like to have a girlfriend or even maybe a quick fling with a girl, I come off as too desperate at raves/dancing things and that put girls off. I have memories from the last few months that suggest that was what happened, I dont want to be completely aloof, but I dont want to try too hard either   help?   thanks
20090203121929AAraCQv	Family & Relationships;Family	How do people decide what team to support in the Superbowl?	Ok, my team of record is the Oakland Raiders because we live near Oakland (actually in San Mateo, Ca which is very close to Oakland).  To be honest, I'm not interested in sports generally and football is almost as boring as basketball.  I was over my parents home on Sunday to watch the Superbowl and I noticed that most of the people there were cheering for the Arizona Team.  Is that because Arizona is closer to California then Pennsylvania?  Recently, my husband came home on Leave but he's back in Iraq.  He brought his best friend who got Leave the same time and because his friend doesn't have much contact with his family so he came home with my husband.  His friend wound up marrying my girlfriend (she's more like a sister to me) and now she's pregnant.  I'm pregnant too lol lol.  Anyway she was cheering for the Pennsylvania team because she said her husband (my husband's best friend) is from an eastern state and wants that team to win so she wanted them to win too.  I think she was the only one cheering for the team from Pennsylvania.  I e-mailed my husband with news that the Arizona team lost.

20090203134457AAZQtLU	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why don't old co-workers and friends respond to emails?	I've worked for a number of different community service organizations and I've also had a number of old friend who've moved away. I'm usually quiet and don't say a lot. I'm generally not invited to a lot of parties but people usually say that I'm the nicest person they've ever met, or that I'm really smart. Whenever I find an old friend or co-worker on facebook, I'm so excited to befriend them and see how they're doing. I send them a quick comment to say hello, or a longer letter, depending on what I have to ask about. So many of these old faces do befriend me, but they never write back. How come this is so? I'm not terribly good at politics. I just like to have friends and I genuinely would like to know how they are. I don't think I come off as pushy, if anything, it's the opposite. What can I do to get people to regard me more and actually want to invite me to social gatherings and respond to emails years down the road?

20090203130459AAYIvh5	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should I do about this guy..?	Well, I guess I kind of have a thing for redheads ever since that movie "P.S. I Love You" and my good friend who's a readhead has a twin brother.. & at first I just thought he was cute right, cause I had never talked to him.. but then me and my friend were talking alot more on the phone and he asked her for my msn cause we go to the same school.   Anyways, after about 2 days of talking he told his sister he was interested in me, and I thought he was a really nice guy.. but I wouldn't think of dating him or anything.   So now, he likes me and he came to the movies with me and a bunch of our friends and he likes me more now..   He even switched his class to be in mine..   & hes really sweet and nice, I just can't see myself dating him and for some reason how sincere he is makes me feel weird.. like gives me a stomache ache :S      & he's always saying like, oh we should hangout alot more and he's always telling me to meet up with him at school on my way to classes.      I just don't know what to do, because he's telling his sister that he wants to date me!       I tried the excuse that its to awkward for me cause his sister's my good friend.. and they were like no its not..      & I tried saying other guys liked me, and i didn't want to hurt their feelings.   but that didn't work!      what can I do .. and don't say anything mean please.
20090225020837AAZDBOV	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What should i do about him?	I have been going out with my boyfriend for 16 months, which is the longest relationship i have had, and i really do love him with all my heart.       But lately he seems to be shouting and getting angry me at the littlest things, such as last night i didnt wake him up to get a pancake! Now he is ignoring me and acting like i have done something terribly wrong.       I am ignoring it at the moment and getting on with others things that i need to do, but i just cant help question why i am doing this to myself if he is going to treat me like this!       Dont get me wrong, i want to stay with him and i love him so much but i want him to stop treating me like this over the slightest thing and i am worried that it is because he is hiding something from me and he is doing this cause he feels guilty about something (cause we have had problems in the past with some girls...but not cheating though!)      What should i do with him? Talk to him or ignore him as well..or something different. I really dont know but i know i cant take this much more.       Thank you in advance    x
20090203123649AADcohP	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Caught in the middle..should I sleep with him?	I've liked this guy for over year. We flirt a lot but rarely see each other on nights out so nothing has happened. But we saw each other a couple night ago and he was totally wasted and invited me back to his place and I said no. The next day he apologised and we talked for a while. He told me he liked me but doesn't want to date. He said basically that he wants to sleep together but not just a one time thing. The thing is...I'm a virgin, and he has no idea. I tried to subtly say that I didn't wanna just sleep with him and he said we should hang out together first but basically the next time we'll sleep together. I don't know what to do! I really do like him but I don't really wanna give my virginity up to a guy I know doesn't want anything serious. I wanna sleep with him though! I wish I wasn't a virgin! It would be so much easier.. He's not a bad guy, I mean at least he was honest right? Help me!    I'm 21 by the way

20090203131804AAvPXX0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guh! How do I get past being angry at my ex? ?	There's not much I can do because it was a long distance relationship, and general consensus stays that no good thing lasts forever. I'm still madly in-love with him though..even though I was the one who suggested that we break things off for a while since he lives in VA. I've been on a date or two but non that really shine, and I'm starting to miss being with my ex. But, and this is what hurts, he's already moved on and it's only been three weeks. He has an 18 year-old girl friend now and everything. I'm so hurt and I know its stupid but I can't help but be angry. I don't understand how he moved on so quickly...what do I do to get over the resentment I feel towards him? How do I get over the love I still feel for him?  Dating is just making me see how good I had it...guh!

En esta vida me ha pasado de todo, ya toque fondo, en otras palabras no se otra manera de vivir. Casi 10 a?os he vivido solitario y con poco contacto con las personas, al estar en la comunidad me llenaba de mas problemas,  peleas, humillaciones, etc.      Me veo como alguien que no es capaz de sociabilizar con nada ni nadie, eso me deja como una persona totalmente sola que jamas tendra pareja, no se ni que decir porque la mayor parte del tiempo paso callado.    Ya hize varios viajes a diferentes regiones de mi pais para ver en que clima y terreno es mejor vivir, me tome un tiempo de ir y quedarme un par de semanas en cada uno de eso lugares durmiendo donde podia y comiendo lo que encontraba asi que se lo duro que es una vida asi, un par de armas y alguna herramienta basta para esa vida.      Con 20 a?os de vida que tengo ya me dejo de interesar vivir pero tampoco quiero morir tan pronto, veo dos alternativas o matarme o irme a vivir definitivamente en una monta?a como un ermita?o

But there always an Intuition in my mind that he will not go further with our relationship. Even i ask him so many times whether he is fully dedicated to this relationship, he always said yes... don't worry, m always with you. He loved me all the ways as he can and i too love him as he was doing. But past two weeks he said that he cannot continue with me. Parents will nt be agreed for our relationship and i ll nt go against with them. So better to forget everything. i cried alot.. even i asked so many questions. But he have only one answer.. ''Forget me!''.. try to forget..''. i told abt that to my parents even to his parents also. But no use. i know that i cant get him back.. coz there are so many difrences in us.

As i am laughing i began cryin in between. I am missing him as he hugs me as i hug him...

I know he have no love for me now, but "Dil hai ki Manta nahi" i just enable to accept that he is not in love with me.

Hi! i've been in my school for three years now, and didn't quit make a good impression because when i first got there i was this naive, shy girl and was completely misled! so i got in with the "NERDS" crowd which i did not like! but during my three years i have completely grown up and now i look back and just want to go there and erase it all.      My problem is now, i want to make friends with the other people (The people that get invited to parties & have boyfriends and stuff) but there are three problems standing in my way: 1) I am completely shy   2) I can't get them to see me in a different way as in the girl i've become not the girl i used to be before   3) The group i wanna be friends with is a very big group.      So my question is how to become friends with? hang out with them? Get invited to birthdays and parties      I know i sound competely desperate but this is a huge deal for me!    Thank you! :D =D

20090203115942AAHf3WR	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Twilight, Twilight, Twilight obsessions?	My girlfriend and I have been dating for 6 months now, everything has been going good, Then this Twilight Movie comes out, and everything is still ok, because I let her go watch it with her friends. Then she starts reading the books, and everythings cool, I give her time to read and all. Its a 4 book series and all but I take her to the next city 40 min drive to buy Eclipse and shes all happy. Then the next day we find out breaking dawn isnt at our local store either so she wants me to take her to get the 4th book before she even ends with the 3rd, but I tell her that I dont have time to that night because we had just came back from the city for other reasons. So I promise to go the next day to go get it for her, so she gives me the money and I get it for her the next day. Then last week we hung out and she wanted to read so I told her if she was going to read while she was hanging out with me then she could read it out loud for me to hear it, thats not a problem, but after that, now she has all 4 books and watches the movie online over and over again, and doesnt call my house or hugs me when I come over to see her, or even aknowledges that Im there, just opens the door and goes back to reading. I'm trying to put up with it as much as I can because I know well hopefully i know that she will soon get over this obsession, I keep telling her that its just a charactor from a book, and shes also kind of obsessed with robert pattison the actor, I dont mind, but what I do mind is that its kinda scary when the person you love is obsessing over a book and its actor, and not paying attention to the person that actually loves her, she says the reason she is stuck to this book is because it makes the girl reading it think she is Bella, I tried as best I could, What should I do? or should I just ignore it, and give her some space? like not call her or come over, until she calls me, I really care about her and don't just want to break up with her over this...any comments?

He also says were not breaking up and i say i know and then he says you swear and i say yes then he says you swear on everyones lifes crosses do not count. I think he mite be bipolar. And i'm always doing things for him and then he tells me i dont do nothing for him and that he feels like i dont love him. This morning i called him to let him know i wouldnt be able to come to school because im very sick. Then he gets really mad and starts saying things like i dont care i didnt want to see you anyways, and then i had to go to the hospital and it took me forever in there and i ended up falling asleep. when i woke up i had a text from him and i was getting ready to leave so i called him. I told him what they said and that i couldnt come back to school until friday or monday then he got mad and was like whatever i dont care. When i was getting off the phone with him he just said bye he didnt say i love you, and he use to tell me this constantly. He says he doesnt want to break up. but i dont know how to deal with this. What should i do, and what should i say to him?
20090203121004AA90T3J	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I knew a girl that was sincerely in love with me.But i kept bullying her around!?	Finally she called it quits and left. But even when she left she didn't say she wanted to move. She only said i'm not your girl and you deserve someone better. I never realized i had treated her like that until a common friend of ours spoke with her and told me all this. I know why i behaved like that. In the past when i had been sincere i was ditched by a couple of girls. So this was like some defensive mechanism at work that made me push this girl around when she was so true to me. I regret it so much now and i wish i could have one more chance.When this common friend of ours spoke to her she didn't have any bitter feelings for me. She just told him that she feels the relationship will not go anywhere. I admit what i did was wrong and feel for it so much. Can any girl tell me if i can explain all this to her and win her again? Will she understand ..?

20090203121748AArpojb	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girlfriend trouble...anyone understand?	Ok i've been going out with this girl for nearly 7months now and we've had our ups and downs like any couple I guess (i'm 16 by the way). She's sort of shy and doesn't have a lot of confidence in herself but last week/week and a half - things have turned slightly differently between us and she will want to talk on the phone like normal most nights but now she doesn't put alot of "effort" into the conversation and i find even if i ask her questions like "what you been doing.. or how was your day (if hadn't spoken alot that day) then the answer is usually always very short like "yhea it was fine or nothing much just revision" (something a long those lines) and also if i try and have a conversation or say a anecdote then usually she'll just say "yhea" or "um" but doesn't try to carry on the conversation...really putting strain on our relationship and we used to be able to have a good laugh and conversation on the phone but rarely for the last 2 weeks we have. I know she wants to be with me and talk with me but then doesn't follow through alot and say things on her behalf...anyone help? anyone gone through same thing and know why it just seems she not that interested? Please help   Thank you

20090203122132AApoudK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How to break up gently??	so i will give a little background. i met my partner at my bosses house party 2 yrs ago, he didnt have a job as he had just left the army but at time it didnt matter cause i was swept up by his good looks and charm. the only thing that got too me at time was he always reffered to conquests to friends when i was standing there! e.g dancers, model etc. he finally got a job but we broke up. didnt feel like it at time cause we were never close, just felt like i lost a distant friend. after 7 months started up again, but this time it was more official and we do the family thing, mostly because up until xmas i worked for his aunt (the same aunt that got us together the second time). when he is in a good mood he is great but thats once in a blue moon. im not sayin im perfect cause i feel my self naggin at him. but i am really resentin him cause he doesnt like it when i see friends that is any of them he gets jealous and sends texts like 'have nice life'. and if a friend is sittin there he will nit pick at me and tell me off. a friend mentioned it last week and i was so embarressed!!! i want to get rid of him in the most friendly way, if there is one lol. cause i tried 6 months ago and he threatened me! plus his aunt let me go at xmas and still lookin for work in my field but i need her as a reference. just need tips, advice, experience stories!!        if its not gonna be helpful dont leave a comment, feelin delicate lol

20090203123432AATwpwh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	My boyfriend's distant and not as talkative, am I the problem?	going out for 1yr. Im in college (& live here,1 hr away) while hes @ home working full time. Since i left home he's been distant and not as talkative as usual. Ive visited him a few times before school started and he seemed to keep his distance, I felt like it was just an off week so i didn't mind. Now that I'm away, he doesn't txt/call like usually & wouldnt get one two days later. I told him I felt worried and that bc i'm the one txt/call him that im bothering him? He SAID bc im at school he doesnt want to bother me, he'd rather have me "bother" him than him bother me. Now I really feel like he's uninterested, but he told me he hasn't lost interest in me. I'm going insane not being able to talk to him like we have in the past.  Should I just keep talking to him about this problem or is it me? What should I do?

20090203124250AARtoGg	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I stop thinking about someone in a sexual way?	My best friend and I began experimenting sexually a little over a year ago. I'm a gay male, and he's a straight male. During this process of experimentation, I fell in love with him. Now, a few months ago, he resolved that he's straight, and we both decided that we want our relationship to go back to the way it was: just friends. It's been a long, hard road, but I've gotten myself over the feelings of love for the most part. I mean, I still love him with all my heart as my best friend, but I'm not in love with him anymore. The problem is, I can't stop thinking about him in a sexual way. Every time I get sexually excited, my thoughts always come back to him and our experiences. There have been more than one time in the past few weeks that I've practically begged him to let me touch him; when I'm with him I can't help but to think that way. I don't want to feel this way anymore; I want to get over him so we can be friends again without me wanting to get in his pants every ten minutes. I want to be able to move on and think about someone else that way. I just don't know how to shake my sexual obsession with my best friend. Please, help me if you can....

I asked her out once and she said yes but then we never went through with it. Later she told me that she was going through some tough times. So, we decided to get to know one another while her troubles wind down. This past weekend we went to the beach and had a blast. With us she brought her friends. One of them was another guy whom I knew only a little about and another one of her girlfriends along. In the car she sat in the front with him driving and he was all over her. I barely had any chances to be alone with her. But, they act more like best friends than anything else am I worrying over nothing? The girl I liked and the other guy went to the beach all the time during the summer. She tells me she enjoys my company, knows that when all the drama is over I'm going to ask her out again, she always initiates the conversations we have, so what I'm asking is she into me or not?

20090203131043AAg840Q	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I Wrong?? (Serious Question) (Mature Answers Only)?	I had a boyfriend with whom I was with for 8 months. We broke up last year in around March but we both attend the same school.he was so sweet to me at the beginning of the relationship. I guess that's why I used to love him so much.  I was head over heels for him but he treated me so wrong. A couple of months ago I found out that he cheated on me. But yet we are still friends. I have a current boyfriend whom i love dearly. He is every woman's dream. He treats me the way every woman should be treated. When I am with him I feel like he is the one that i could spend the rest of my life with. But sometimes I think I find myself thinking about my ex ( the one I first told you about) to often. Sometimes I flirt with my ex even though I know I have a boyfriend. I remember when I was in the sixth grade (I'm much older now) how I used to pray for someone to be good to me and I finally found him but I'm ******* things up. I know that in my heart that my boyfriend is who I want to be with, but I feel that I think about my ex a little to often. it's funny to me because I was usually the one always getting hurt, but now I'm hurting someone that loves me so much.      Am I wrong for still thinking about my ex even though I love my boyfriend and he loves me twice as much???      Should I tell my boyfriend about my situation???      Thanks ;]

20090203131746AAwtYFG	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Got any relationship advice?	Me and my boyfriend have been together for over a year. (I'm 22 and he is 27) We both live in different cities...which is about 2-3 hours away from each other. So to start off we have this long distance thing cutting into our relationship. I go and visit when I can...and he does the same. But with us both working it makes things harder. I'm so very much in love with him and I cant help but miss him. There are times where I cant bare it anymore but all I can do is sit alone in my room and cry. I get jealous when he goes out and has fun with his friends. Its not because I think he is doing something he shouldn't be or because I don't like his friends...its because he isn't out with me. It bothers me so very much. I don't know why. I'm not the type of girl to restrict him from doing something with his friends because it doesn't include me. And I hate telling him about how it bothers me because it upsets him, makes him think that he is hurting me because he is going out with his friends or what ever. I don't know what will solve this. I don't want to break up so don't put that down as a comment. I just would like to know what my options might be. I feel that living closer would make things better, but there are things hindering that. I just don't know what to do anymore. Its to the point where its actually effecting my social life (where I don't want to go out anymore), its effecting my work life (going into work depressed), its just effecting me all around. What can I do??
20090203131914AA65mzM	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How soon is to soon to met your girlfriend's parents and start being seen together? ( LADIES ONLY!!!!)?	i've met this young lady when i started working and attending school, but every since we've started talking its been a little weird, first, we've only known each other for about 6 months, but we instantly became friends, then more, but after we "became" a couple she wanted to meet my mom, which i was cool with, but when i asked her to met her mom and grandmother she said "it was too soon?." which is kinda weird b/c when she asked me i didnt say " its too soon" i just let her meet them, it went off without a hitch by the way, they loved her but its like " i dont wanna get to caught up in something that i haev a bad feeling about?. " the thing is she reminds me TOO much of my exgirlfriend ( which was my 1st) and i dont want to go through that again, so all i'm asking is " when is it too soon? and " what does too soon mean?" "does she feel the same way about me that i do about her?."

I always thought I'd sign one regardless if I made more or if my bf made more...just thought it was the smart thing to do.  I'm now thinking of telling him that I won't bring this up again and would never ask him to sign one.  I'm not sure if I'm comprising too much?  What do you think?

After a few minutes he just came out and said i'm goin to call u back later cuz somebody's about 2 come over. But i never hung up until someone else called him and they were holding a conversation and i got mad and hung up. Later i called back and he said 2 gurls and three boys were over and he was tryin to get them out of the room so he'd call me back. He did but i didn't answer and when i called back his house phone just rang and rang...so i called his cell phone and he ignored it. Then he called me back and i said y didn't u answer the phone? he didn't hear it, y did u ignore my call, i didn't ignore it the gurl that was in my room did. That sounds suspicious! I'm not givin him any so it sounds like he was doing sumthin with that gurl. My best friend called him and he told her one story and told me another. ??

There's this guy at my job who has started coming by my office talking to me.  The first time he came by I didn't think any thing of it. I just thought he was friendly and I'm always friendly with people and I talk to everybody.  Now he comes by and says he wants us to be boyfriend and girlfriend and he hugs and kisses me all the time.  At first I thought it was funny, but now it's starting to make me uncomfortable.  I think he's a nice man but I'm not interested in him like that.  He asks me if I love him I don't even know him.  He wants to come by my house and he thinks I will be in love with him. I keep trying to tell him I will be his friend and talk to him at work but it's not working. Maybe he doesn't understand me since he doesn't speak english well.  I don't know.  What should I do.

20070313230245AAWuxNa	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think of this? (Guys please answer)?	I thought this guy was showing interest in me - so I asked him out, and he agreed to go  (he even blushd) but I should've known I wasnt ready to date yet. (Selling the house, drama with the ex, etc.)      I see him two months later and remind him of that date. He stands real close to me, softly tells me "To be honest...."   he's in a relationship now, it's not "official" and so on, and so on. I nodded my head and was about to walk away, the strange thing is he kept going on about it "I'm out of the game, I'm not in the market anymore" then he says "Thanks for the offer though, I appreciate it"      I GOT IT DUDE!! I understand.      Why'd he feel the need to go on and on with the explanations?
20070409181148AA8FMj9	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Few things about love, maybe?	Okay, I am 13, an eigth grader. I have been going out with my boy friend for 6 months on the 27 of April. I know I am young and everything, but I really feel like I have found someone special. He is my first boy friend, I am his first girl friend. We haven't had out first kiss yet, but I can wait. He is funny, I can't help but laugh at everything he does. He is really cute, with blond hair, blue eyes. He is about an inch shorter than me, so he is 5'1, but I don't care, not at all. He is very supportive of me and everything I do, and I of him. He makes me feel special, and whenever I see him I get butterflys in my stomach, and I feel safe. I want to see him happy, if he came and told me he didn't want us to be a couple anymore, I don't know how this sounds, but I would be okay with it(not that I wouldn't be sad, I would cry). But I do want what is best for him, and I want him happy.
20090128162337AAPmng8	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I really need help with this girl?	So girls how would you take this situation:      In your school there's this guy that talks to you sometimes. You're pretty sure he likes you but you don't like him back.       So you hint at him a couple of times you don't like him, but when you have a conversation you talk like you would to anyone else.       Then one day he goes up to you, says hey what's up, talks a little bit then says hey you look really pretty in that shirt      How do you take that compliment and do you still dislike him and are you going to try to avoid him?
20070418045021AACtzC0	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I am in a rollercoaster relationship?	i love him with all my heart, more than i ever loved anyone, he can be really sweet and protective, loving, sexy, funny. i maybe love him too much. cos the highs are amazing, i just cant get enough. that's great, except when things go wrong they go really wrong. it's like we both care about what the other one thinks, so like if i am quiet it will really really upset him that i'm not sharing with him, even though it could be nothing and it ends up being a big thing. i end up crying for days, get pains in my chest, everything almost like a break-up. he will sulk too cos he's hurt too and not wanna talk. then we make up and i am really happy. we are like best friends too. that's actually our strong point. the relationship is rocky cos we are both caught up too much. what should i / we do??

20061017114850AA78nQU	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Para las mujeres mas bellas, un poco de dulzura y ternura. Besos a todas?	Me siento triste en esta noche y necesito sentir de tu boca, las palabras mas bellas,    de tus ojos, las mas dulces miradas,   Necesito, que tus manos, acaricien mi piel, y que tu cuerpo proteja el mio.   Siento frio y es tarde, y no tengo tu calor para que me dé abrigo, no tengo tus besos, para que me den vida, ni tus ojos para iluminar tanta oscuridad.   No abandones amor mio, tu tiempo, por curar mis heridas, no dejes tu vida por estirar un poco la mía.    POR QUE CUANDO NADA TENGA PARA OFRECERTE; CUANDO YA NO QUEDE NI MI ALIENTO, tu te quedaras con lo vivido, y yo con lo sentido.   Pienso llevarme todo tu amor conmigo, y cuando me vaya, te quedaras con todo el amor que aún tenia para darte.       ,
20070410232837AAzXaMF	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Is this appropriate?	I've been talking to a girl who works at a coffee bar that I frequently go to. I don't have her number yet, and we haven't seen each other outside of the coffee bar, but she is always friendly towards me and I think she has some level of interest in me. She told me her birthday is coming up soon. I was wondering if it is appropriate for me to get her a birthday car and a small gift (a puma shirt - its her favorite brand). The first time we met, she thought I was Italian and was excited because she was born and raised in Germany and her mother is croatian. I told her my grandmother is Croatian too and she seemed excited and asked if I spoke it, which I dont. I found out how to write Happy Birthday in croatian though, and was going to write that on her card.       Do you think she will like this or will it freak her out?

20061209074320AA4nhjX	Family & Relationships;Family	To give or not to give gifts, what should I do?	I am a very giving type of person to say the least. To me two wrongs do not make a right. You can read my profile to get some ideal of what is going on around here. Every since that I have been here, my sister-in-law and her whole family have been against me, which in turn it effects my parents and hurts their feelings. There is a lot going on that I don't have time to tell right now. All them up there wants to go get a job and stop mooching off of my parents, but my parents want me to stay right here. Them up there are always getting money from my parents, but never want to VISIT with my parents.They invited my parents to Thanksgiving super, but since I was not invited, my parents would not go. They were invited to a b-d party, I was not, they would go. My question is, I was going to make candy and cookies for Christmas as I have no money to by gifts. Do I give my sister-in-law and her family some to as a gift or not. I am for my parents. I keep thinking 2 wrongs don't make a right.

20070326074322AAuaI9r	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I being played?	I've gotten to hang out with this girl for sometime now and we've become pretty good friends. She's never dated anyone, she is of legal age, and she's not shy at all. I can't tell if she's just be friendly or if it's her lack of relationship xp. She has a lot of admirers but blows them off.      She cancels plans and asks me to hang out with her. When i visit her workplace and am about to leave, she makes a sad face. She asked for a piggy back ride the other day and i carried her to the otherside of the street. When she came over, i gave her a shoulder massage while she was checking her email.      She said that the reason she likes me is because she can talk and bother me i will probably never fall for her. Then she said she was unsure about that and that her charm might rub off on me.      Everyone thinks we're a couple because we hang out a lot and when asked if we are, she always says i'm too good for her.

We're in high school, and I really want it to happen.  I was thinking that during lunch I could take him outside away from people, tell him i loved him, and tell him that even if he hasn't noticed, i'm super impatient, and that i've been trying to hide it...but i've never waited for something i wanted so bad so long.  and then ask him if he will kiss me.  we're really close, but no kissing yet...tell me if this sounds okay, or just give me suggestions.  he's super shy, that's why it hasn't happened, lol-kissing advice is helpful too.  thanks for the help, i really appreciate it!

20061230024136AArYfjf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does anybody think it's often more difficult to get over a person who wasn't necessarily "right" for us?	I'm experiencing some back-and-forth feelings about a man that just wasn't right for me. There were so many signs that we were wrong for one another almost from jump, but I still see him posting on a website we both frequented (not a dating site) and it's now clear that he's involved with a woman on the site. I'm doing my best not to go to the website because I know it's not good for me to see him there.  I've never experienced this kind of difficulty "getting over" relationships which were infinitely more healthy than this one. Is there some issue here that is unresolved for me?

20070901072816AAHWzYo	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Mixed signals from this girl. She's absolutely stunning. What should I do?	This girl has given me mixed signals for awhile. I helped her with interview prep few months ago (we're in business school) and she asked me to dinner. At dinner she was flirtatious, but gave mixed signals, told me about her BF (in another city), then asked about my situation. I said I'm single but she said I should even go after girls who have BFs, it's all fair game. Since then, I have continued to get mixed signals. She sent me a card from her spring brk, then ignored my email when I asked her out, only to ask me to dinner to 2 wks later. Then, ignored me again for several weeks. Later, when we were at a party, she asked me to dance, we rubbed up on the dance floor. Next day, at dinner she again talks about her BF and says "I'm a ball of sexual tension" - WTF?! I got sick of the games so didn't contact her for 2 mnths. Suddenly, she called again, but when the phone tag ended, said her BF is in town. She's a stunner, maybe I can meet other girls thru her. Should I stay in touch

Mi novia me ha confesado los romances que tuvo antes de conocerme, con quien se acostó y con quien no, es una my buena persona y la amo, pero con lo q me contó siento que se me cayó del altar que la tenia y sé que es machismo puro y no puedo dejar de pensar en lo que hizo con los otros novios anteriores a mi, pienso que lo que hace conmigo lo hizo con los otros y me atormenta todo eso.

Desde hace un tiempo me habla mucho por el msn. Según lo abro, ya me saluda incluso antes de que me dé tiempo a ver a quiénes tengo conectados, pero luego en persona casi no me habla. A través de una amiga él supo que me gustaba y que dejaría a mi novio por él, pero él dijo que lo sentía y que le gustaba otra de la que me habla muchísimo. Mi amiga le dijo que no lo siguiera haciendo porque me hacía da?o, pero lo hace igual y hasta pone fotos de imagen para mostrar de él (cosa que nunca hacía ) y fotos que insinúen cosas de él y esa chica. ?Por qué hace eso sabiendo que me hace da?o con ello? Lo hace como si nada y me hace comentarios de esa chica y él y lo coladísimo que está por ella contínuamente y los deja caer como si tal cosa. No es mal chico, pero no entiendo por qué lo hace sabiendo lo que le dijo mi amiga. ?Me ayudáis, por favor

20070329040205AAFAfiY	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	The Perfect Match or heartbreak waiting to happen?	If a man has a girlfriend, but tells his best female friend that she's his 'perfect woman' (after a conversation about sex) does this mean that he's interested in his friend? Is there any way that saying that doesn't imply he has feelings for her? And what if he says he loves his girlfriend, how can you love your girlfriend and tell your best friend that she's your perfect woman at the same time?   I'm the friend. I assume he hasn't told his girlfriend about this. He's said other things to me too, like we're made for each other and we're soul mates etc. I asked him why he said those things and he just said sorry & he wouldn't do it again. That was before he came out with the perfect woman thing, I asked him why he said that and all he could say was that he didn't know what to think. I love this guy, but what the hell is going through his head? He's not a bastard, because he's a sweet, shy moralistic type. Argh! Help me!

20070102084641AAR4vuc	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I Drop My Friend Like A Bad Habit?	I'm a guy and I got into an argument with my friend about 7 months ago.  My buddy is a bit of a drama queen and he likes to create controversy among all of us.  He also is good at manipulating others when it comes to having my friends take sides in an argument.  Now, this argument between the two of us was over something stupid and it got even more tense due to the fact alcohol was involved.  We both said things out of anger and stopped talking to each other.  I tried on a few occasions to reach out to my friend to see if we could hang out and mend our friendship.  He has not replied, in fact he's done nothing but ignore me.  I've heard from some of my other friends and he's trying to pin them against me.  I don't like this.  I feel like I'm begging someone to be my friend and it feels pathetic.  Do I try reaching out to him one more time or do I drop him as a friend?

Nos llevabamos muy bien, estabamos siempre juntos, yo no conozco a nadie más en clase, intenté hacer amistades, pero la gente k conoci no iba mucho por clase o tenian materias distintas a mi, solo coincidia con él en todas, por eso es normal k estuviesemos juntos. Durante este tiempo sin vernos nos distanciamos un poco, xk mi chico decía k mi amigo kería algo más, k yo le gustaba, asi k no lo llame, ni nada, para k no pensase mal.    He visto a mi amigo la semana pasada, hablamos y sigue igual, me cae genial. Yo se lo presente a mi chico, le dije mil veces k estaba ekivocado, k solo somos amigos, k el no siente nada x mi.    Ahora k regreso a la facultad kiero poder estar con mi amigo sin k mi novio sienta celos, ?como hago para k entienda k solo es mi amigo?

We had a football game last week and she didn't even invite me to go with her(she went with her other friend.) So it wouldn't matter if i hung out with someone else right?! WRONG! she had a ***** fit saying i was hanging out with people i didn't talk to, but she was wrong the people i was with are in my classes. And shes like "your my best friend! you should be with me!" but she didn't even invite me to go with her! We made up, but only for like a week. On sunday shes like "you've changed, your a total ***** you only hang out with your new friends" whitch is true i have been hanging out with other girls, but so has she, she hangs out with alot of other people that aren't me but i don't ever get mad at her. So why does she have to "own" just because im her best friend. My parents say shes just jealous, but what do you think it is?

I'm a single mommy to my beautiful 3 1/2 m/o baby girl and her biological father voluntarily gave up his rights in court.  My boyfriend loves her like his own and although we may one day break up both he and I consider him her father.  Can he legally adopt her just as in a a step-parent adoption w/out any plans of marrying me?  I'm 16 but he's several years older.  We live in NS, Canada so the laws here may be different than those in the US- I also know they vary from province to province or state to state.  But I'd appreciate a general answer.  Thanks!!!

Llevo casi dos a?os de relación con un chico y éste verano su mejor amigo le confesó que sentía como una chica y que en un futuro quiere cambiarse de sexo. Ellos siguen su amistad y a veces, le envía sms firmando ya con nombre de chica. A mi me molesta, y aunque se lo digo a mi pareja, él parece ponerse de su parte y eso me duele. Ayer le dije que si la situación seguía igual, era mejor no vernos y, para mi sorpresa, me ha dicho que como quiera. ?Qué debo pensar? Antepone a ese amigo a mi, qué debo pensar sobre sus verdaderos sentimientos. ?Es que no me quería??Espero a qué él me llame??Llamo yo? Por favor, aconsejadme.

20070314212253AAPviCi	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Is this normal in families?	Ok, well there's the situation. My mother's  side of the family has never seemed to like me. When we were younger they would always take my cousin's side in any argument, and they would insult me all the time. For example once my cousin had been making fun of me (I was  6 at the time, she was 8) eventually I started to cry. Then one of our aunts came over and she just started yelling at me for crying she started talling me that I was useless and that I couldn't do anything but cry. it's 10 years later and they've done the same thing over and over. My mother tells me that they don't hate me, but they would call me useless whenever she wasn't around, and they would pretty much always ignore me because I was shy when I was younger. The other thing is I'm the first person who isn't completely asian in my family, my father was caucasian and my mother was asian.    Is this normal or considered 'right'? Or did I break some sort of unwritten rule by being born and being a shy and quiet person?

I tried to explain my feelings to my girlfriend and told her i didn't really want her to go to the rave. I don't want to control her but i can't help the way i feel about something. She then got really angry and said i was boring and i can't change her and that i have to get used to it or get lost. i didn't think something like that was necessary to say. The odd thing is, I'm not a boring guy at all, i love to go out and have fun. but anyway... i don't know what to do. i really don't want her to go because i have heard bad things about raves. But it's hard when her friends keep telling her to go with them.
20070330095350AACDhZl	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What do you think this means?	I have been friends with benefits with this guy 4 a few months now & when I 1st entered into this I asked by best guy friend what were the rules. He said #1 don't get attached in any way, #2 never think that it's going to be more then what it is & #3 don't ever act or show that u are getting attached if u are. I am not getting emotionally attached & I have followed all the rules.      Is it possible 4 the guy not to follow the rules. This is my 1st fwb relationship so I have made sure I followed the rules just to know that I could handle this. The guy tends to contact me a few times a month when we are not hanging out just to see how it's going. He has called to have a short conversation, but at that time did not ask to come over. This last call he seemed worried. He called because he thought I was ignoring messages from him that I never got. I cleared the air & things are ok. I just thought it would not matter because we are fwb. I'm happy 2 think it matters but what about the rules?

Tengo una amiga la cual su a mistad no puedo dejar ya que es la esposa de mi cu?ado y por obvias razones tengo que tratarla,  pero no la soporto porque me doy cuenta que me tiene envidia y a cada rato se la pasa comparandose conmigo: que ella es más alta, que mis suegros la quieren más a ella, que todos hablan mal de mí que estoy gorda que me veo más vieja y cuando va a mi casa solo se la pasa arreglandose maquillandose y no me ayuda a nada solo espera a que yo le sirva la comida  me hace sentir muy incomoda y me baja mucho al autoestima.  yo he tratado de que no venga más a mi casa, pero es imposible ya que es la esposa del  unico hermano de mi esposo. Pero no la soporto porque quiere estar medtida en mis cosas y criticandome no me encuentra nada bueno y en verdad me hace sentir muy mal .  Yo creo que ella me tiene envidia por que yo tengo dos hijos y ella no puede tener hijos porque es esteril.  que puedo hacer Gracias

20070411050320AAbCfEi	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Problems with relationship (Women please help me here!)?	I have been in my relationship with my fiancee for nearly a year. Since putting a ring on her finger, she has taken a dramatic turn for the worse. She has become so into work that she rarely spends time with me anymore.       Furthermore, she doesn't even speak to me whe she comes home. We have tried everything to open the lines of communication, and now, she doesn't even bother. We go to bed each evening pissed off at one another, and wake up and she doesn't even say bye to me before she leaves, its like she doesn't care.      I am really thinking that its my time to move out and move on. I attempted this back in March, and she went bizzerk on me and cried like crazy begging me not to leave. I am so fed up now, that I really don't care anymore..She is just not pleasant to be with. As for me, I have such a positive outlook on life, and even though I have my share of problems also, I don't bring them home. Do you think I am doing the right thing?

20070418100551AAwnZGB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why would he do this?..please help.?	I befriended my friend's bro. on facebook-kind of like myspace, & he accepted. He is an acqauintance. He is 4 years older than me, and we are both in college. He is ready to graduate from a military school-I was going to send him a little congrats. note for working so hard-as I admire him; I am very patriotic & I hope to have the same career.But-out of no where he or someone that got onto his fb deleted me from his account; so we are no longer friends on fb. I never really knew him, except a greet or to. I was waiting for the right time to tell him congrats-I wanted to be his friend. But, since he deleted me, I don't know if I should still send him a message. I did like him at one point and I think he knew-but it was a while back. I didn't want him to think I'm as naive or I like him like that. I'm hurt because I never did anything to him. I have a friend that might know something-but I don't know if I should ask her. Why would he do that?
20070422193511AATUzb7	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Need advice. I am pretty sure that my BF of 11/2 years is at least cheating online?	.  About a month ago, I was sitting next to him and he was text messageing someone back and forth.  I asked who he is was texting and he said that he was texting his  friend "Pete" from work.  Well, my gut feeling felt differently.  I layed down on his arm where I could see the text messages. Well, let me tell you that there were sexually explicit.  I confronted him about it and he said that he was talking to his friend about work nothing more.  I asked him to show me his phone then but he wouldn't let me because he said that his text messages erase after he sends them.  Which is BS I'm sure.  Well, he swore on his grandparents grave that he wan't talking to anyone that way,  so I decided to forgive him.  I still don't believe him though.Anyways,  because I still don't trust him I went online and noticed that he has a MySpace page. It says that he is looking for a dating relationship with a few girls on there.  How do I approach/dump him about this?

We've been together 6 months, I'm pregnant with his child, so leaving him is my last resort. He's extremely jealous of my ex that I was with for 2 years and was in-love with. He can't get over it, and he talks to me about him every single day. It drives me crazy. He accuses me of still being in love with him and I just end up getting confused. He puts ideas in my head and then he drags out all these old memories so then the rest of the day I spend thinking about my ex!  I've told him to drop it so many times, but somehow it always comes up again. What am I supposed to do?
20070430163143AAOeW5P	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Long story about break up?	She was a Sagittarius and I'm an aries   when I met my girlfriend now ex she was 19 and I was 24   first 3 years were great, we clicked like no other, I would make her laugh just by looking at her or touching her.... I could make her laugh so hard that she couldn't stop   I always loved her with all my heart, give her all the respect, kindness, kisses, and all the good stuff...I'm a hopeless romantic and a gentleman to the girls I like, respect and love   after 3 years I went into business of my own which is doing well but it keeps me away from home 7-10 sometimes 14 days at a time   but when I get back I can take as much time off as I desire 1-2 weeks no problem ..its not uncommon for me to be off 3months or more out of a year if you put it together   she works full time and goes to college 4 times a week so its not like she is lonely when I'm gone   I was so happy with her I didn't even look at other girls   but during the 4th year she started to be distant,not call or return call, always had different plans when i got back home and I didn't think nothing of it because I trusted her and she promised me she would never cheat on me because by doing that she would disrespect her self   besides she had her group of friends and I had mine....that was never an issue...actually we liked it like that   than one night she breaks up with me while we were in a bar with all of our friends hers and mine...it was a shock to me because it came from nowhere and it hit me like a sledge hammer and it drove me to tears and i sobbed like a little child in a BAR where all these people were looking at me! I didn't care, i could not control it. She comes back the same night with big tears, at first i didn't want to talk to her but she cried so much my heart couldn't take it and I gave in and took her back just so she would stop crying besides I did not want to split up....after that she promised if there ever is an issue she would come and talk to me   I'm very understanding and easy to compromise with, she promised she would never lie or push me away like that again   one year later same thing started to happen but worse, she would push me physically away when I was trying to snuggle up with her in bed, not call for a week, not call back at all, change plans 3-4 times a day so I finally confronted her and asked if everything is ok because I feel that something is wrong   she says that everything is fine and that she is sorry for pushing me away in bed but she was sleeping.   I asked her few more times during next few weeks and same story all over   than I finally couldn't take it anymore and made her tell me ( over the phone) what is going on   at teat time she asked for two weeks to figure out what she wants......fine I gave here that   two weeks past and I was ready to end this if she couldn't be honest again   so she calls me and her only excuse was that she was 19 when we met and now she is 24   just like that its over....she ruined the whole image I had of her and the trust is gone...      all of that happen 6 months ago and ever since than i not my self. I did not talk to her once, just txt for her bday, thks giving and xmass...she responded to these but not to the new years txt      it was quiet for 4 months and than she txt me for my bday......i did not respond to it....ive shed many tears, got mad, sad, betrayed, used unappreciated and everything else....   I did everything i could to forget about her...buried my self with work, got back into shape, but still can get her out of my head....i collected all of the vday and bday cards she ever gave me and dropped it off in front of her door....I even started to write a long letter to her but when it was finished i burned it....   how come i cant let go of this....every time i think of her my eyes get wet and I hardly ever cry      i;ve been with different women since than, but i cant get into it and I feel like I'm detached, no matter how good the woman is....my sex drive is nowhere near what it used to bee and when i do get woman in bed and get her naked i loose interest like THAT, poof and its gone

20070503100046AAHvO7a	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	Para Mujeres de buen corazón... que piensan?	Hola, como estan? Digamos que en el pasado pues no he sido un modelo de chavo, de hecho solia ser algo patan y confieso haber llegado a ser infiel. Desde hace un a?o empece a cambiar, de plano casi deje la fiesta, corte por lo sano con las amiguitas, en fin, soy muy cortez. Trato de ser una persona a la que no se le reproche nada. El punto es que ha sido dificil, pero sobre todo ahora que trato de encontrar una mujer buena que me ayude a seguir por el buen camino. Primero pues las que saben algo de mi no me creen nadita, y no se, pero parece que ahora que quiero ser bien, todo se dificulta con el sexo opuesto, me castran ya los jueguitos de dominio, solo quiero conocer el verdadero cari?o aunque se escuche cursi. Una buena amiga me dice que me acerque a la religión que ahi podre encontrar a alguien, pero.. diantres! no se ni lo que creo. Que debo hacer?  y donde encuentro a alguien asi? Me da miedo perder lo que he ganado. Espero que tomen en serio mi pregunta. Gracias.

20070514174151AAWbzjP	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I love him and miss him...what should I do?	So, my boyfriend of 1 year and I just broke up a couple days ago because we found out I'm pregnant. We went from being a great, normal couple to ignoring each other completely. He has called once since the break up to tell me he'll help me and support me. It seems like I lost him over night. I'm sad because we didn't have proper closure like a fight or a real break-up so I'm left here, just lingering. I miss him so much. I know he's a jerk for leaving me in a time like this, and  I shouldn't even be thinking of him, but I can't help it. What can I do to cope with my emotions? All my friends seem to be saying is "screw him, don't think about him"....But it's not that easy..........I want to talk to him and I want things back to how they were just a week ago! :-(

My best guy friend set me up with him (it's his best friend)....and we had a blast!  My date was so nice to me and he acted as if he liked me....he even wanted to kiss me at the end of the night! and he held my hand at different points.....ok so it's been about a week and a half.  he wrote on my wall on facebook. we texted. HE HASN'T CALLED. he said he's really busy now and can't wait to graduate. well i guess i was just any other girl then....i feel like if he REALLY liked me he would CALL!  he called me the night before prom and we hung out.

My brothers best friend and i have seemed to have gotten a lot closer lately. Not like flirting or anything like that, but it seems whenever he comes over to our house for my bro we end up hanging out together. I have known him for years and this is definitly not a chrush...it's also not like im always going over to him, he asks me to play a game with him or he will start up a conversation with me....I care so much for this guy, he broke up with his gf a while ago it was a mutaul decision and i felt so bad for him because i knew he cared a lot for her. i know im gaurding my heart because i seem to do that with everything, and so im not sure how he feels about me. I also im not completely sure how i feel about him...   should i do anything or just wait and see what happens? and does it seem wierd that we seem to end up together when he comes over?

20070724220431AAhR54t	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I think I'm in love.?	I met a girl about a year and a half ago. During that first half a year, i developed strong feelings for her. I wrote her a poem to tell her how I feel but I signed it with the name i used here (I'm a very shy person). Eventually, everybody figured out it was me (which didn't help my shyness out any). We hung out a bit until I moved. For a year, I lost almost all contact with her until recently. I really don't know what to do. I want to see her again but I don't know exactly where she lives. The only possible time would be during school, but I can't skip my classes without my parents finding out. What should I do?

Well his name is josh and I don't like him. we're both very young but he is more immature than average.. he's a bit of a puss*. He's already got a girlfriend(suprisingly) but lately he's been looking at me weirdly.. oh, how do I explain this? ah, well, It's like if someone saw a ghost. they'd be like wow and all wide eyed. that's what he is like when I look at him. And EVERY time I glance at him he says "What?" But I am hardly even looking his way. he's an idiot. umm, also, I heard him say my name, and I have been hearing some boys say my name.

20070821060822AADSE7A	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Am I a bad boyfriend?	my girlfriend asked me to take this week off for her. I promised her I would so I would be able to spend time with her before she leaves for college. She leaves on Saturday. I don't leave for school until September 4th.      All I asked her was if we had to spend the entire 9 days together that I took off and if I could go to a friend's beach house from Saturday night - Monday. She seemed to be very upset that I'm not including her but I can't. It's my one guy friend and his family! He doesn't want anybody else!      I PROMISED HER I would be home by Monday Night!! She asked me if she could stop by early today and I made up a lie that I wanted to sleep. She sadly caught me in that lie. Truth be told I stopped off at another friend's house who lives close by for the night. It was raining and I didn't feel like driving and wanted to hang out with him. I know i PROMISED HER I'd be home last night but does it really make a difference if I'm home by this afternoon or this evening?

20070907203109AAkImf6	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	SEX with GIRLS  - GUYS please answer?	Broke up w/ somebody a month ago.    Some girl flew in 3,000 miles away to meet him   He had been talking to her in an online game called secondlife.   Anyway, he and I had amazing sex and I was his first. I broke up with him cause he wanted me all while he still wanted to meet this "friend" from online and I wasn't going to let him have his cake and eat it too.   Lets just say the sex we had was powerful! I'm in my 30s and I was not a virgin by any means and we connected big time and he felt it too. I feel kind of stupid for breaking it off w/ him but I had too.   So, she has been in town for a day now. I'm sure they've done the deed and I'm glad for that. I want him to experience this stuff.   Anyway, my question is       Will this guy compare us sexually?   Next, if the sex isn't that good w/ her will he try and come back?   Not that I want him back but this is what everybody is telling me.      Thanks!

She is so similar to my current girlfriend, but she is more selfless, and does not smoke weed. I find her just as attractive, and she is not 3000 miles away. She and i hooked up while i was on a break with my gf and i couldnt get her out of my head since. i told her it wouldnt happen for a while again, and she said she had a bf as of then (coincidentally) when i officially got back with my gf, she officially got with her bf. her relationship started out long dist, and mine is petering out. is there a chance this girl likes me if she keeps telling me about this? do i have a chance with her if i do break up with my girlfriend? how would I go about getting this girl?

20080103085428AAWQ1ed	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Interesting things about dating an older man, possibly uplifting?	since i've been with my bf who is 50, I've noticed a few things. like when i was talking about him at our work with some of the other girls, since he's known to be a womanizer & having slept with more than a few women at work, one of the college interns who was 21 & on her 2nd round & as soon as I mentioned Jerry Hernandez, his name, shes like, "oh, he's not circumsized!" of course i didnt tell her we were dating. when i got to meet some of his kids, it was weird meeting 2 daughters that are older than me, his son who was my age & then 2 younger kids, 10 & 9. I could tell his son was eyeing me up, made me a bit uncomfortable. another interesting story was about his last kidney stone. Jerry had some blood in his urine & got worried it was another stone, but it was nothing. he said he was standing over toilet, trying to pass his last kidney stone & when it came out, he threw his head back & screamed & the stone bounced off the rim of the toilet & into the sink! i love him, but weird?

Ok well i was at a party and i was really drunk (it happened about 3-4 months ago) and there was this girl she was pretty wasted too. She was really cute and we were dancing for a while then we started to make out, we then proceed to go up stairs to get a little closer. We then found an open bed room and started to get naked about half way in it she fell asleep, i wasn't done and she was cute and i couldn't get enough i then finished then when i was done i had pulled the blanket over her and left. Then that monday came around and my older brother had came over to talk to me because he was having problems with his soon to be fiancee (he thinks the world about her) he had told me that she had went to a party and had got a little crazy and ended up having sex with someone and got pregnant (it was all a surprise to me because we haven't talked in a while and he need someone because our parents died in a car crash), he was telling me he doesn't know how he feels about her anymore and didn't know if he still wanted to go through this, I had assured him that we would all go to a counselor and talk about it. (Bad idea) when we all met up and thats when my heart stopped, I found out that his soon to be fiancee was that girl i meet up with that time she knew right away and so did I. So please people i need help how do we break it to him, do i take his place and Marry her or do we never speak about this to him i love my brother and i don't want to make him mad because we are all that we got. What do we do because she wants to keep it there is no questioning it she made up her mind. HELP (joey if your reading this I'm sorry i didn't mean to break it to you like this.)

Her mother died when she was 10 so her dad does not know a lot about girly stuff.  Where we live I cannot find a place for a reception for under 3000 and with all the other stuff I am sure it will bust my 5000 dollars.  She has not asked him to contribute because I did not want her to, but in the same time I am wondering if he is going to just do it.  If he is going to I would like to know for obviouse budgeting reasons.  Should I just let her ask him if he is going to help?  He is very well off, but I don't want to seem rude and I definetly don't want to go into debt for a wedding.  Your advise please.
20090225012301AAywOK4	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	So, my father starts dating this woman...?	See if you can explain this one.  My father starts dating this woman about 3 years ago.  They were basically dating even though the ENTIRE time my father constantly reminded everyone "we're just friends."  lol, at one point, he even broke it off with her because he was annoyed that she kept using his car or something, and during those 4 months he wasn't hurt at all, and didn't even want to speak to her.  Then about 2 months ago, she finally gives him the ultimatum...  marry me or I'm gone.  And so he says he wouldn't marry her, and she decided it was over.  She moved on, and within days met another guy.  As soon as my father realized she had a new guy, all of a sudden he's head over heels in love with her...  crying every single day because he can't be with her!  And here's the craziest part, he went back to her and begged her to marry him and it looks like they will be getting married soon now.  First off, is it just me, or is this wrong on so many levels?  And second, why in the world are people's feelings so controlled by stuff like this?

We dont tell the teachers at school as they do NOTHING but she did tell her parents but they have denied helping her and everything along those lines.      Ok so my friend make this youtube video as a joke with this stick-man picture of her and her friend and this girl thats bullying her in particular, in a hole with red lines that say blood with an arrow.      The girl found out and now her dad is involved and rang up Hannahs parents and has said he will ring up the school and the police because its a "threat"      Personally i dont think its a threat because it doesnt say she WILL kill her and this girl has threatened my friend constantly and her parents did nothing and she probably drew pictures just like it. I thinkt he calls were an invasion of privicy and of safety in my friends own home and school.      I wanna know if they do go to the police what areguments can my friend use?? she said she had deleted all the horrible emails they sent her but our whole group read them so could we stand as like wittness type things?? i know its not a court thing but how can we prove that Hannah is a victim and the bully isnt as inoccent; shes probably done the same thing about hannnah.

I asked a lady in the office out for a coffee (using online chat) and she replied saying "I dont mean to be rude, but I am very busy right now".

20090203134717AATV8tK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Girls: Would you give your number to a guy your not interested in (please answer)?	I was talking to this girl I used to work with and at the end of the conversation I said she should give me her number. She gave it to me without any hesitation and I gave her mine (she said "sweet" when I gave it to her, lol). I think she has a boyfriend though; she didn't tell me she has one but I'm pretty sure that she does. But I don't know why she would have given me her number if she has a bf; we're not friends, when we worked together I think we talked maybe 2 or 3 times. I'm thinking of just ignoring the fact that she might have a bf (she obviously had a reason for giving me her number and wanting mine), I want to ask her if she wants to get a drink with me. What do you think?

20090225003953AAvMzwN	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I like this guy but don't want to hurt his feelings , is he normal ?	Is this guy normal?   this guy often zones out sometimes when we stop talking or when he gets bored and start talking and moving his hands like if he was seeing something. That scares me. When I asked him he said that different scenes are repeated to him during the day and that when he focuses too much and thinks deeply, he kinda see almost real stuff. He said that it's been happening to him since he was 12 years old. is that normal? is he going crazy or might have schizophrenia??   He talks to himself in a very soft voice, i can barely distinguish what he's saying. and he even reacts by moving his hand sometimes. it's like hallucination or if someone is possessed. Should he say a psychiatrist??   every one is making fun of him =( ,, i tried to distract him from focusing so he don't get into this weird condition again ! but he acts like none is near him like people around him ! he emailed me saying that he likes me !, well i like this guy but not as a boyfriend.. it's not because he's acting weird i don't care about that at all ! i don't want to hurt he's feeling ,he's waiting for my answer if it's yes or no ,! well my answer is no ! but i don't want him to think that i rejected him because of what he's acting like ! cause he once told me that he got rejected from three other girls he loved and he also mentioned how HARD it was on him to get over what happened ,, he even cried =( ,,!! i don't know what to do , i don't want him to be hurt , or to be the forth girl he loved and got rejected from ,! i really care about him but as a brother not more or less ! what shall i do =( ? am really confused right now !

20090224220052AA94lR7	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	A model a waitress or my Wife?	My gf of 5 years and I decided to give each other "Time out" which from my point of view, we are seriously braking up. Even though I want to be with her, I don't get any further than rejection. On the other hand due to my job I get to be around with models, fit models, designers which are my coworkers. There is one girl that we kind of like each other and there is chemistry indeed. We have talked about going out and get to know better, but my GF was always the reason I never took this other pretty girl seriously. Now I'm kind of single ( we still live 2gether) I asked her out and she didn't hesitated to agree. She is a hot fancy model that like expensive and look fresh, which is the reason I always liked her, but I don't feel like affording her expensive taste. I know her, she drives a nice Jaguar and dress alike. I know this other chick a waitress in her parents restaurant. I love her personality and we  get along well. She's half Cuban and half Colombian and beautiful, she got a daughter 15 months and daddy isn't around. Damn I know everyone will say don't mess with her baby-mammas drama. And her Ex I don't know but I don't care at this point, I just like her a lot and felt that since my gf is dumping me and I still have some game I should date someone new to see if I'm able to have fun and friendship with a girl other than my loved Ex. I'm trying to get over the fact that our relationship is  just perishing. At first it was a dream now it's my nightmare.    1- try to save my relationship and be patient?   2-Have fun with the hot Korean model.   3- Go out with the other girl that I barely know but I like so much?   4- seat back and hold my breath until see how things go without pushing them too hard?      Model: 28 like a dream girl that I don't even know why she wants to go out with me?? LOL--- fancy girl--    Waitress: 28 her face is perfect and her body matches it.--- Good girl--   Ex: 25  Just beautiful inside and out. She always stands out for her beauty even more when she smiles.! Waking up to her is the best moment of my life everyday.   1-2-3?           4- Dont say get a life!!, I already got one and it's very busy.

20090225012405AAtNXyf	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How did I become this guys pity date?	At my friends b'day party a month ago I ran into one of her male friends I hadn't seen in two years. Two years ago I was fairly infatuated with this guy and I pulled some really subtle moves and he didn't seem interested so I moved on. Anyway saw him again, first time in ages and man he has changed! His features are totally different and he has put on a bit of weight.        I on the other hand, have dropped a couple of pounds and toned up. He asks for my number and I reluctantly gave it to him (I felt kind of sorry for him)      So he calls me everyday the next week asking me to go out with him. So I finally gave him the pleasure of my company. We went out & it was good he was cool.       Anyway couple of days later I run into him at a bar with his friends (male and female) and he totally blows me off. I am thinking you are embarrassed about me? How could you be I am so much better looking than you!       Anyway I consult my friend who knows him and she told me he is really popular. He has loads of friends and a new super hot girlfriend every couple of weeks (she could have had the decency to mention this to me earlier!) And to top it all off he has a masters in applied finance - he is smart possibly smarter than me he he he.      So I go on a pity date not knowing the pity party is for me! How does this happen? Has it happened to you?

20090203134715AABaTUr	Family & Relationships;Family	I need some advice please?	Ok, so I am a 21 year old woman.  I am recently engaged and am getting married in May 2010.        I am working as an Electrical Engineering Aide and make about $40,000 a year.  I also just bought a house!  My company wants me to go back to get my bachelor's degree (I only have my A.S. so far) and they will pay for it.  It will take me like 8 years to finish because I work 40 hr weeks and I have a waitressing job on the weekends (just to make a little more money).  I have always thought of myself as being independent and a very driven worker.      I feel like my life is missing something, I really have these impulses to start a family, I really want a baby.      I don't know what to do, because I have always been the kind of person that wanted to get all of my ducks in a row before I even thought of having a child.  I always wanted to get as far in life as possible, knowing that having a child would slow down the progress, but I want one sooooo bad.  It's not like I want one just to have a baby, but I feel like it's kind of a perfect time to start thinking about a family, after the wedding of course.  I feel I am ready but I am putting it off.  I always thought I would start a family in my 30's.  But than I think, it will stop me from reaching my dreams.      Sorry about this being long, but the question is: is this normal to have such strong mothering desires?  What would you do in my case?  I am I stupid for wanting to have a child at my age which I would be 22 after the wedding?  Or just any advice from other young mothers.  Please don't judge me or say mean things, I am just overwelmed with these feelings and would like some insight thank you!

I've asked a question like this before, and to my surprise, there was a staggering number of responses that indicated that girls like this. I am unsure so I am posting it in a more direct format. Girls. Do you like it? And why?       I am currently dating the girl of my dreams and we haven't talked about anything sexual at all at this point. The last time we made out, it got pretty hot and I tried as hard as I could to hide the fact that I was...erect. lol. Unnecessary precaution?
20090225011139AA84kDC	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Difficult Question to Answer. Love. Does she mean it?	I have been dating a girl for 2 monthes. I realized the other day that I was in love with her. I had no intention of telling her, because I was worried that the feelings would not be reciprocated at this point. To my surprise, the next day she confessed that she loved me. I was very stoked and immedietely informed her that I felt the same way.      She recently confided in me that this is the first time she has been in a relationship that she has truly loved the other person. She told me that other guys have told her that they love her, but she would always tell them that she wouldn't say it until it was true. I am very flattered and happy about this, but at the same time, I am almost in disbelief. Do you think that this is true?  I certainly feel that if it is, this is a genuine love that we are experiencing. But I am just so doubtful. Tell me what you think.

20090203135823AAXCwgW	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How do I make this less awkward for her?	I (stupidly) told my friend who I like and he is going to tell everybody the next chance he gets. The girl already knows that I like her after a one-on-one conversation i had with her. The problem is that I'm probably only obsessed with her for superficial reasons, which is probably why a lot of guys like her. Plus, she has a boyfriend which I'm guessing doesn't help.    Any ideas on how to stop this guy from telling everybody (I've already tried death threats)?  Is there any way that I can make this less awkward for her?  Would she still be friends with me if everybody found out?

One time I had 13 drinks worth of vodka in an attempt to deal with my anxiety. I don't think that I was hitting on her, I was just making conversation. She has a boyfriend but I swear I'm not trying to get with her, I just want to at least talk to her and be friends. Was it insincere for me to get drunk?

Whenever she writes a note, or a msn convo or something to me, she always asks "Who do you like at school?" AS in which boy do i have a crush on.. She kept annoying me , and she does this all the time! So i got really annoyed so i told her "Er, its none of your business who i like and dont like" She then didnt speak to me and is now annoyed at me...Who is at fault here?
20090225013249AAGQ6cx	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why is my friend acting weird?	Well, let's start off with a story: My friend is only 3 days older than me, and our parents have known each other since before we were born. She also lives right across the street from my grandma! (You can see how we met). I've LITERALLY known this girl all my life! We're 14 now.   I used to live with my grandma in kindergarten and we'd play after school almost every day. We were the best of best friends could get.      Well, I moved away since then, only about an hour away. It's also the closest major town, so we go there often, especially to visit my grandma. Well, last summer I spent 2 weeks at my grandma's house and at this point in time I hadn't seen my friend in 6 months. So, her mom has her run an errand over here and she comes in, gives my grandma something, and leaves. She doesn't say "hi" to me or anything. She didn't even LOOK at me directly (like acknowledge I was there) , but I'm sure she saw me, it's not possible she didn't. And no, she wasn't in a hurry, she has no excuses there. When she left she kinda skipped down the driveway a little.    Then the next day her and her mom were cooking dinner. She likes to cook. Well anyway, they were out of corn and my grandma had me run some over there for them. My friend was acting all silly around me now. Talking in a slightly silly tone of voice, and acting goofy. Then when she went to go back inside (we met halfway in her driveway) she kinda did more of a skip then a walk. By now I'm just confused.      We hardly ever hang out anymore because we don't live close by and she's never at home. Between school, homework, sports, after-school stuff, church, church activities, this, that, and more. She's always busy. We used to hang out more than this shortly after I moved, but now it's starting to get were we don't hang out as much... And whenever we do have the chance to hang out we never end up doing it. I really miss my friend and I'm wondering why she's acting like this. When we actually do get to hang out, it's just like the old days when we were best friends. We can talk about anything, but after that we usually don't see each other for long periods of time. We're still friends technically I guess, but it's definitely not like it was.      Now it's been over a year since I've hung out with her, yet we've had a chance to do so last summer, and a few times after that. (By hanging out I mean that I was out of coke to drink, and me and my grandma were outside. Then my friend and her mom were outside, and they were going to the convenience store to get some things. So my grandma sent me with them. When we got back home I grabbed a seat on their front porch and watched her and her mom strip the finish off of a dresser because they were redoing my friend's room. We hardly talked at all, it was pretty awkward.) If you call that "hanging out" then you're pretty lame. I haven't "hung out" with my friend since.      I even asked her if she had a boyfriend while her mom walked away for a second, and she replied, "No." in a VERY quiet voice, not saying anything after that. I did notice she was smiling a little, but NOT out of embarrassment, she was smiling more out of enjoyment. Don't ask me why, I have no idea.       What really gets me is that we've never had a fight. EVER! I can remember only one time in like, 1st. grade. We were playing hide-n-seek. I counted to 20 and she hadn't found a place to hide yet, and I instantly tagged her. So she got mad and we started arguing about what number to count to. When that's your biggest fight, you know you're good friends. That's why I don't understand all of this.         Also, one time when we were like 9 or 10 she came over to play and we went into the playroom. After hanging out for a while she grabs a stuffed toy and starts hitting me with it. It had hard-plastic eyes and I told her it hurt. And all the did was giggle and kept on hitting me.      I know that's like, 100% flirting, but we were only 10 at the most!      So the most recent time I saw her my grandma goes in the laundry room which is were she now keeps the toy chest. I saw the stuffed toy she "beat me up with" and it jogged my memory. So I grab it and confront her about it. I said, "Do you remember this? You beat me up with this!"      She said, "Did I? Are you sure? I don't remember it."      I reply, "Yeah I'm sure! You don't remember? Seriously?"      Then she's like, "Nope! I do a lot of things I don't remember."      She had the same smile and the same silly tone of voice as before, like she was happy I brought it up. I thought this was really weird. (but that could be a good thing...)      When we do hang out every now and then we're still good friends and get along fine. She's never said anything about not wanting to be friends, and she's always nice. That's why I don't get it.

20090225013844AAjBLkw	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Do women who are bi polar usually self destruct during a marriage?	I mean, I cant imagine it's easy for someone to deal w/a spouse who's bi polar? Surely, relationships like this dont stay the course? Im sure there are exceptions to the rule, but w/marriages failing so much today, and divorces at an alarmingly high rate, it's got to be doubly tough for anyone to deal w/someone who's bi polar, especially w/the economy in such a shambles?

Well today, my husband said we are too young and he is tired of this marrige and he wants to move back home with his parents for a while!! I am soooo hurt and it makes me so angry that he can't even try to do anything to work on this marriage! I don;t want a divorce, and I have been trying but I can;t do this by myself! I really love him soo  much and that's my down fall, sometimes I wish I didn't! what do I do? I have been crying allday and I can't even pick myself up! I really love him :(
20090225010639AAiuzkh	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	After he ignored me, what is he now thinking?	i have this close guy pal who invited me to be his prom date in a joking way. i didn't know that he was already inviting me, so i only told him my true feelings that "i don't want to go to prom". his face hardened a bit but it immediately returned to its soft features after a second. i didn't answered him with a yes or a no because i really didn't know that he is serious in his invitation.      a day before the prom, my gal pal told me that my guy friend invited her to be his prom date and she accepted it. and she also told me that my guy friend told her that he already invited me but my response was "i would rather not go to prom if he was my date". it was totally different from what i uttered. i'm not angry with my guy friend because i think he misunderstood my statement.      hours before the prom, my guy friend and i are texting each other. we are discussing lots of stuffs about each others personal life. the truth is we're really like best of friends.      on the prom, he and my gal pal entered the hall together. that was the only time they are together because after it, he left my gal pal and he stick with his guy pals. he totally ignored me for the whole night (as if i don't exist in his world). it was also so obvious that he avoided talking to me, because there was an instance that our teacher ordered him to tell me something important, he used his guy pal to pass the message to me. he didn't dance in the party, no one among his guy pals attempted to convince him to dance because he was too serious and quiet in his seat and most of all everyone among them are scared to him because he has his rarely seen hard features on his face for the whole night.      i am not enjoying the party so i didn't dance and i just grab my cellphone to text my cousin. we had very interesting topics so i forgot my depressed feeling about my guy friend. everyone on our table and the table next to us(where he was seated) know that i am holding my phone. to my surprised, my guy friend texted me! but i didn't replied because i want him to know the feeling of being ignored. after an hour, i gave a glance at his direction and i was shocked to find him looking at me. he held my gaze for a while, luckily my cellphone rang because of my cousin's text, so i was released by his expressive lonely eyes. through the corners of my eyes, i occasinally catch him looking at my direction.      after the prom, before i was going to sleep, my cellphone rang and it that was my guy friend who was calling. but while i am deciding if i would answer his call, he ended it.      now i am confused about my guy friend's thoughts. i don't know what he was thinking. after he totally ignored me, he attempted to communicate with me through call and text. what is he thinking? what should i do?

20090225012713AAp3Dws	Family & Relationships;Other - Family & Relationships	I need some help. I'm 16 and my dad's girlfriend is 20 and it is REALLY AWKWARD?	Well, I need a bit of help here about how to deal with this situation. I'm 16 and my parents are separated and I spend 2 weeks at my mum's house and then 2 weeks at my dad's house. My dad's is 47 and his girlfriend is 20 (they met at his work and have been going out for like 8 months) and yesterday he told me she is properly moving into his house, which isn't surprising because she is always staying there anyway, but OMG I don't think I can deal with this.      I try to get along with her, but it is so difficult. We both don't know where we stand with each other. When she tries to act like an authoritative figure, like asking if I've done my homework and stuff, it is just ridiculous because she is only 4 years older than me, but then I can hardly get along with her like she is my friend (which is what we are closer in age to), because that would just be weird. And when I talk to my dad about it, he's just like "you don't have to be her friend, but you have to treat her with respect, because she is extremely important to me", but that is just easier said than done, when I really dislike her. She is so annoying and she seriously thinks she is so much better than everyone else and that she is so cool, because she is pretty and skinny and works in advertising, but then I told her if she was really that cool, how come she couldn't get someone her own age and has to date someone 27 years older than her, which is just pathetic, so now she is being all bitchy to me on top of that, because she thinks it is cool or something.      Anyway my main issue is that it is my birthday soon and my mum said I had to have my birthday at my dad's because I had it at her house last year. I have had a sleepover with my friends for my birthday for as long as I can remember, so I don't want to break the tradition, but I haven't told any of my friends that my dad's girlfriend is only 4 years older than me, because it is SO embarrassing and I am never, ever going to live it down at my school when they find out, which they will at my birthday! I begged my mum to let me have it at hers but she said no and that I need to talk to my dad and then my dad just told me to grow up and if I don't like it then don't have a birthday party! But even if I don't have a sleepover my friends are going to find out soon, because they think it's really weird they never come over to my dads anymore and I can't keep it up for ever.      PLEASE HELP me deal with this situation! I don't know how to get along with her because it is so awkward, I don't know what to do about my birthday and I don't know how to deal with my friends finding out and never letting me live it down! HELP! HELP! HELP!

20090224225411AA4Cx9n	Family & Relationships;Friends	Why does she act this way?	I'm in a group of friends, but within the group, I have one friend (Lauren) that I'm paticularly close with.       The problem is, is that my other friend "Megan" is weirdly jeleous of our friendship. Like it has come to the point where she reads our comments on msyapce/facebook, checks where she is on our tops, and aalways wants to know if we did anything with eachother.       If it was just that I could probably deal, but recently she's been getting mad at me. She says that I'm just using Lauren and that the group gets along better with out me.      I really try to include her--I try to make inside jokes with her, and plan outings with just her and I,  and things with me, her, and Lauren. I also encourage Lauren and her to get together without me but she still seems like she's jealous.       The weird thing is, is that while she's made at me because of Lauren and my friendship, she never gets mad at Lauren. On the contrary she copys Lauren's style, dreams, hopes, and activities.       So basically I'm wondering why she acts this way, and what I should do about it? I can't just dump her because the rest of the group doesn't have an issue with her.      Also when it's just me and her, she's perfectly normal.      So suggestions?      (Oh and sorry this is so long, and filled with errors, I'm really tired :P)

20090224220010AApGtYZ	Family & Relationships;Weddings	How can we get out of attending a family wedding?	My husband and I can't stand his side of the family.  Since getting married ourselves over 10 years ago, they have increasingly become rude and expect us at all family functions.  My husband works hard as an engineer putting in TONS of hours and on his time off (wknds/holidays, etc), he wants to be with me and our two kiddos.  Because we started cutting back on attending family events, when our son was born we didn't get a card from anyone on his side of the family and now no one even sends the kids gifts for birthdays/holidays.  We barely speak to his parents or sister and then his sister called and told us their cousin is getting married and her son is in the wedding.  We haven't seen the extended family in 5+ years and today we received an invitation to the wedding in 8 weeks.  Neither of us want to go to the wedding.  What should we do?  How do you get out of it when it is 8 weeks away?  There is no way after the way they have treated us and our kids that we want to drag ourselves to this wedding.  Thoughts?  Thanks.
20090224220016AAKmVM8	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Summer Wedding Advice (Colors)?	HELP! I really want to use yellow/brown as my wedding colors. (Think Sunflowers all around) But yellow bridesmaid dresses seem to blend in with the White Bridal Gown, and a brighter yellow seems all wrong on a dress.

20090203134830AAgVcOK	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Crush on a shy boy!!?	So I have a crush on this boy but I've never ever talked to him! He's really shy and only really talks to his friends, not really any other girls. Everytime I walk past him in the hallway on the stairs(like everyday!) my friend says he stares at me or glances at me out of the corner of his eye. And everyday when I wait for my mom to pick me up, I see him there. And so usually he just stares out the window, but once I was walking by him and was quoting a movie and when I walked past him i said "and your hair rocks!" but not on purpose, and my friend said he looked at me out of the corner of his eye and smiled a little bit. And another time my friend said while we were waiting, he kept looking over at us. And another time me and my friend were talking about going snowboarding over the weekend, he's REALLY good btw, and then when we were talking about it he looked over and like kinda smiled I think. So my friends think he looks at me alot, but I've like never talked to him before! And we don't have any classes together! So, how could you tell if a shy boy likes you, because I'm boy stupid and shy. Should I talk to him? Thanks for reading all of this :) Lol Help is deeply appreciated!! :))

20090203140605AA1BOlH	Family & Relationships;Weddings	Wedding invitation poem?	Just wondering what you think of the following for the first page of our wedding invitation (we're having a small booklet with poem, main invitation, directions and rsvp card). I've searched high and low for something which talks about love, but isn't specific to the couple and I can't find anything so I found these two verses from Bob Dylan's Wedding Song and think they're really nice, but would they be appropriate to have on a wedding invitation?      I love you more than ever, more than time and more than love,   I love you more than money and more than the stars above,   Love you more than madness, more than waves upon the sea,   Love you more than life itself, you mean that much to me.      Ever since you walked right in, the circle's been complete,   I've said goodbye to haunted rooms and faces in the street,   To the courtyard of the jester which is hidden from the sun,   I love you more than ever and I haven't yet begun.

My brother is getting married and his fiance's friends are impossible, they picked out a very slim dress in periwinkle, I'm a size 16 and 5'10 and my sister will be 7 months pregnant on the big day, we got our dresses yesterday and there is just no way these dresses will fit either, mine doesn't zip all the way and my sister's is already snug and barely has a bump.      The problem is these hideous periwinkle dresses were bought from davids bridal and of course they discontinued this color (with good reason) and there isn't a bigger one in the country! what I need help with is, what other colors would make a good contrast to the periwinkle? i'm thinking maybe we could pick out another color dress and cut up the periwinkle dress and use it as an accent color a sash, wrap or something. I want to bring my idea to the bride but I honestly don't know what to suggest. Can anybody help? Has anyone done anything like this? Thank you so much for any help!!

20090225001357AAFhvcI	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Confused With Myself... please read and help me...?	If you have a little time, please read this and help me regain some sense.      I am a 20 year old American man living with family in Tokyo, and I have a girlfriend for a year and a half. I met her, she was my dad's student, and we started going out more and more until we became a couple.       A year later, I decided to go to school here, because I wanted to stay with this girl. I bust myself hard, to get into the school, and I couldn't be happier. But now, as this has all calmed down... for some reason, I'm confused with myself as to why I am thinking like I want to take a break from the relationship.   We never fight, the time I spend with her is magical and fun, we never seriously had a bad date, and it's been fun for these past 18 months. However, while I should be happy, I feel like there is a lot of stuff in my life going on that is confusing me. Did I get into the right school, is this what I want to do with my life, should I stay with this girl, am I kidding myself with how I feel with her, why did I work so hard to stay with her only to feel like this...      I called her and told her I wanted to break up, because I need some time to think. But after doing that, I had short breaths, and I started crying... and now I'm going to meet her today to talk to her that I do NOT want to break up, I just need some time to myself to see where I am right now.       I made a list that described her...please let me know what is going on with me.      GOOD   -beautiful, sexy, cute, darling   -can have a good conversation   -loves me for who I am, not for what she wishes I was   -soft and beautiful lips   -feels right kissing her   -doesn't judge me when I cry   -does things for me no one else will   -can work together in fashion industry   -love hearing her play piano   -really love her   -hate the thought of her not being in my life   -thoughtful; thankful; giving   -makes me feel better about myself   -can connect with me when I need her   -cute, sexy   -love feeling her hand in mine   -feel like love when im with her   -year and a half long relationship   -eager to learn with me   -can relax with her   -get good and helpful advice   -would never cheat   -wants to work together towards a future   -smart and skilled, good with money   -experienced new stuff with her   -makes me want to better myself   -never ever fight, never had an argument   -we make real efforts to meet up   -happy going to meet her   -have lots of fun together   -best friend   -all of this is coming from the heart   -made good memories and think we still can   -want to always look good for her   -never been told I look like a king, until I met her   -busted *** to be with her   -never been able to be closer to anyone else   -act so silly with her, and she likes it      BAD   -long distance, takes an hour for either to meet up   -always sending the same stuff via texts   -got a little boring   -i didnt open myself enough to her   -can not eat right without her, i havent eaten anything in the past 3 days   -no cultural similarities   -a little chubby   -shyness annoys me at times but i figured out its whatever   -feel like it's early      People tell me I am still young, need to make mistakes, and understand what it is to lose a love.   She is my first girlfriend, hence people telling me no matter what I do you'll be upset. One part wants me to stay, one part wants me to go out and explore. I'm so upset at myself as to what I want to do...      Am I being selfish? Is me falling out of love in a relationship a bad thing?      What can I do?

Because I notice I go out with girls a lot, like I will see a girl friend and ask her if she wants to eat and most of the time well go eat and hang out, other times when I see them I will chill with them a little, maybe walk around school and talk, and other times I will talk to some girls during break...I realized just the fact that I have a girl just being with me at the moment is a good thing, right?

20090225001937AAThqXy	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I just let go?	So I was dating this guy about 10 months ago...and we only dated for four months. Yes, I know that wasn't a long time but we would talk everyday 24/7 and we hit it off really good. We were unstoppable. But after four months his phone got turned off and it was hard for us to talk. So I broke up with him...after two months of not talking he then came back and told me he missed me and he wanted to be with me and he loved me and he wasn't playing mind games with me...3 days later i find out he got a new girlfriend! I was really sad wrote to him telling him that i missed him and loved him and I wanted him to be with me he said he was sorry but "it just happened" and he liked this new girl...we didn't talk that much for a bit after that and i was a mess! We would talk a little online but not that much then about 4 months after maybe even five he wrote to me on my birthday! on myspace and just put "=(" said he didn't want me out of his life and he missed me. i told him id be his friend. we talked on the phone he told me he wanted to be with me but not till his life was better. yet..he told me about all these girls he had gotten at and laid...then not to long ago he got a phone..i told him how i had a boyfriend and he told me about this girl he was talking to..then he left me a voice mail saying he loved me i told him not to tell me that anymore because he didn't love me. he told me he did that he always has loved me and that he keeps fighting to be even just my friend because he does...then we just dropped the convo. the thing is when we talked on the phone he kept talking about these girls and i don't know what he wants! Now he stopped texting me...what should i do? should i just move on already? or should i be the one person who never gives up on him? should i keep being his friend just so i can keep him in my life? or should i stop because it hurts me? IDK WHAT TO DO...=(

20090225005450AAjhCsm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Do guys get scared and run when a girl tells you she loves you first?	I met a great guy at work and we slowly were becoming closer than friends. We did a lot of things together outside work and we frequently txted each other. He introduced me to a lot of his friends too. He doesn't asociate with any of our co-workers at all, so it took me by suprise how open he was to me.   We had been going back and forth acting like a couple at times but never actually labeling our relationship as such, for over a period of 5 months. I finally told him that I felt like I was starting to fall in love with him and he kind of freaked. We no longer speak at work(we work in close proximity to each other at all times), txt messaging has stopped as well.   We went from best of friends one day and after my confession he told me I was too unstable for him to be friends with me.

20090225010338AAIvb4j	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	I know this girl who's really emotional... like - she's from a rich family and she whines a helluvalot...?	So anyway, she's always like, but why??? but it's like the long one that starts high and then goes down in pitch: whhhhyyyyyyyyyyy. Anyway, one time she cut herself at work with a scalpel (work in a bacterial lab) and when she came back from the bathroom, you could see she was crying. Anyway - I've started to think her whining is cute. I know I know. But I can't help it. And the other day when we were alone in a room I was working in, I spoke to her, and I saw her almost jump and get teary eyed as she began talking to me. Like - Do people ever cry when they're happy that a guy is talking to them? I dunno. haha. whatever. She's weird. I have a small crush on her now.

I had sex with this guy friend a year ago after knowing him for several months....      then he was gone for a while and we just went seperate ways due to different places in life, opposite schedules, loose ends not being tied up...      It was basically a one night stand.       A year later we have another one night stand. Before hooking up however, i told him i wanted to date and not just be a one night thing for him...      He told me he likes me also and doesn't intend to make me a one night stand but hasn't called in two days and is busy this weekend and sort of avoiding me....not treating me like someone he is newly dating....      is he extremely casual. taking it slow and normal, or was this just a one night stand?? basically...did he use me for sex?

20090225013057AAYZRPq	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Why wont he show me even once in 6 months?	Am sorry, its a lil long. But I couldnt summarize it in fewer words. Thanks.      My boyfriend and I have been together for 1 yr and we work in the same team. There is this one woman I particularly dislike and he keeps talking to her at work (on chat, smses) the whole day (literally 4-5 hours at work). She has told a couple of people he flirts with her. I told him about it. However, he still continues to talk to her. I asked him to show me what they talk about just once and he refuses to divulge any information. He keeps saying its general office stuff. But refuses to show my any of their mail exchanges. I want to actually see it what they talk about so much thruout the day. He and I dont have so much to talk about in the entire day. So what does he talk to her ? I have been asking him to show it for 6 months now since I doubt something is on. But for 6 months he keeps telling me the same thing - that he deletes the chat records everyday and cannot show me. Do you guys think I have a reason to be insecure ?      I gave him an ultimatum last night. And he still chose not to reveal his convos with her. I was hoping he would do today, but all he did was chat/ text/ call her. He has not contacted me or tried to convince me at all. Like last 6 months, this time too he will call in 2 days and start talking normally, but will refuse to show his chats/ txts.         And now he called me up today morning and tells me - What happened ? why are you pissed ? he behaves like everything is sorted out. When I point out it isnt, he stops communicating again. What is he upto ?
20090225013925AAgcNnS	Family & Relationships;Family	Pain in the *** brother in law?	So basically my 15th yr old brother in law is a little ****. To sum him up I'd say manipulative, psycho, A.D.D ridden rednut kid. He sits on his *** all day and plays online video games. Really this kid needs some friends. I cant stand him but the thing is, I'm living in his parents house from work purposes. He tries to pull all these things just to piss me off or say nasty comments. I want to smack the little **** out. I have to deal with this for another 1 and a half to my partner and I can get our own place.... then he wont be coming over, ever. Yeah thats about it.

20090225014419AAGxaLm	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I find fault in this guy for this sexual encounter?	I have been seeing this guy we had done oral on each other before, but due to a recent break up I was not ready for sex. So we were going out to eat and I planned to drink. I told my date when I was sober we can do anything sexually, but NOT SEX. He said ok and I trusted him. I had two margaritas. One strong and one average. I was tipsy, but not completely drunk. We got back to his room clothes came off he went down one me. I said I could come a lot faster if we had sex. I then grabbed his penis and rubbed it against my area. Then with my hand I guided his penis into my vagina. I initiated it. But he never stopped me. Should I be angry at him for not keeping to his promise to not have sex in this situation? He says he didn't think I was that far gone to not decide clearly, but I know I would 98% not have done this sober. And I had, had some drinks. Did he violate my trust? Was it as much my fault? Do I have a right to be mad?

20090225020254AAGQN11	Family & Relationships;Family	Do you think i stand a chance against my mother in court?	I'm 13. 14 on April 6th this year. And living in the state of Nevada. I moved from my mom's house April 15, 2008 and lived with my dad since. We tried to make things easy, talk and keep it simple but she won't give it up. Lets start with some reasons..lol. i'm a way more better, relaxed and chilled person now that i live with my dad. I don't rebel against him, nothing. When with my mom, we do nothing but argue, we fight, i got into trouble, we could just never agree on anything. My mom, her boyfriend and his son [21 years of age] live together now, they're all smokers. Every where and anywhere they just smoke. If one person isn't smoking, someone else is. My dad and step mom [ who i live with ] only smoke outside and only every so often. My dad has been paying my mom child support EVEN THOUGH I LIVE WITH HIM! AND when i lived with my mom, i never went out of and did anything. That money should go to me. School, and a car and college. Even if its in an account but its NOT. It ain't going to me so maybe its going to something/someone else. And right now, her boyfriend and his son have no jobs. And she's been living here since June 2008. Let me tell ya, i haven't had a dollar of that money since my dad moved out when i was 3 or 4. And she gets 800 a month. She didn't take me anywhere then and not now. And she hasn't recently been giving it back for whatever reason. She's been on vacations to Canada and across the country and ect. But not me, nuh uh not with her. But every where my dad has been i've been. If there's one right choice i know i can make for the better benifit for myself, its this one. Its not like I'm making a choice on whether i wanna turn to drugs, or drink alcohol, no. This is one choice i know i can make a right choice on and I'm going to stand by it and fight for my rights, as i was taught. But she's being selfish.         Should i go on?

20090225022304AAJYDdZ	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Should I be concerned about old 'friend' who is being kept secret?	I am seeing this girl who in her previous relationship nearly had a thing with another guy, it all came to ahead and she had to forget about him... Since splitting up with her last fellow and meeting me she has sought him out again and is resuming her friendship with him. She says it is innocent but she keeps him a secret i.e. when talking to him or meeting him... Is this because she has something to hide or because of how her last boyfriend was when he knew about this other guy? (he was extremely jealous of him). If he is not such a threat then why can't she invite him into my friendship circle too?

20090225023018AAblEuH	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Guys can you advise a girl?	i'm sorry this is most likely long. but i need some genuine help from a guys point of view.       so I don't know what is going on... my bf broke up with me then a few days later takes me back and claimed he just needed some time. Then we're fine we see each other hes calling saying I love you and miss you first... Then few days later nothing... Like I have to be the one to contact him to show hey I'm thinking about you. But then we were texting and I asked him to come visit me and he said no he'd rather hang out with this girl this girl or this girl. so I got upset and my friend who he'll actually talk to started texting him for me... then he called me and started bitching at me telling me to leave him the hell alone and for my friend to leave him alone.       Then started saying leave me alone I don't want to date you... etc.. hung up.       I'm confused about his actions... He freaks out if guys (friends) call me even if I dont answer or reply back to their texts even when I'm not with him, and when I ask him if he's faithful he goes off saying ya know I know of 10 girls that would have sex with me yes its temptation but no I'm faithful.       he blocked my number so I can't call him... but he can call me. He wound up calling the next night and said basically... That how once before when I wanted to take time apart because we both lost our jobs and weren't living on our own yet that I wanted to take time and get my life straight. But he took it at the time as I didn't want to stay with him and work to getting back to that. So I stayed with him. But staying with him and him moving 2 hours away to get away from his meth addict father isn't helping... So basically he's now making it sound like      a. im annoying (i can understand why because me not having a job to occupy my time and him being so far away is making me anxious to hear from him all the time and have that reassurance)   b. that maybe he's thinking its best we take time apart to get ourselves straightened out. and maybe then we can work things out.       but... idk.... I don't know how to read him. Some people are saying he's an asshole and a womanizer he doesn't love you its just a game.    Others are saying they can understand the kinda guy he is... basically leave him alone.       But all I can think about is how... when he was living closer to me and how we spent almost everyday together he wasn't like this. Yea we had our problems but he was always here. But now that he's far away and with his single party buddy that has him drive him around everywhere its just causing more problems.      Or the fact that because... And I do realize these things now that I've done that most likely pushed him away      the whole not hearing from him for a day or 2 and getting anxious then asking those hinting ?'s  like is something wrong? Why wont you call me? don't you want to see me? or saying i miss you too often...       can you tell me... what hes probably really thinking? cuz its so all over the place. could be multiple things... could be either plain out he just doesnt want me... or it could be yea he wants time and things arnt the best time to be focused on just each other and im getting annoying (dependent)....      i guess my main ? is why would he break up... then come back saying what he said. then saying i love you miss you just randomly calling me to say it. then nothing to me doing it. to him wanting to break up... and blocking my # but calling me to say that whole no job no apt thing...      much help appreciated :)
20090225023313AAts4xf	Family & Relationships;Friends	What would you do in this case?	i have this 'friend' who wants to spend all day everyday with me. at the moment i have a lot going on in my life and i've asked her several times to give me space for a few day (she hasn't done that so far). when i have reluctantly agreed to meet up with her, all she does is talk about her dead beat boyfriend (they're on and off more than a wh**es knickers) and how bored she is at home (she's mum to a 6 mth old). when i don't text back immediately to her she witholds her number and rings asking why i didn't 'tb' right away. i've tried to be nice and ask her to give me a break. moreover, she's on the dole and all she wants to do is go out drinking, having lunches, etc and she's constantly asking how i can't afford to do this also. take today for instance, she has text asking ill i go out for lunch and she'll pay. she says i can pay her back- i prefer to keep whatever money i have for family activities or savings- she is aware of this. yesterday she phoned 15 times before 11 am. i'm already finding things hard at the moment- what are your thoughts?
20090225022138AAIf6kl	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Am I reading his signals wrong?	There is this guy that I work with, who is married, and we get along great. Sometimes there is playful flirting (on his part), but I never really pay any mind since everyone flirts. Although lately he has taken his flirting to seem a bit more than playful. He would compliment me on my looks, told me how pretty I was, and would say how he always enjoys my company and appreciates our conversations. Here is where it shifts. I recently divulge a story regarding a friend who caught a cheating spouse, and I pretty much told him how much I disprove of infidelity. Now he starts mentioning that he has kids (after 1 year) and his wife more, and has even told me that he hopes I don't think that he flirts with me because men would never mention they have a wife and kids if they were trying to pick up women. He has also distanced himself from me. What gives? Did he think I insulted him by telling that story and implying that he was trying to have an affair. Was I right to think he was flirting?

20090225022012AA8nGwd	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How important are looks for someone to be interested in you?	I am 30 years of age, and I feel I look average, I am tall, in decent shape, make the most of myself with nice clothes, cool hair, etc, but I am not great looking by any means, I have imperfections like my nose is bigger than ideal, definitely not massive but some people don't like how you look if your nose is big.    I have good personality and am clever and funny.      Its just there is this woman at work who is so nice, great personality, clever, stylish and pretty. I really think she is so nice and would love to let it be known I like her, but I feel like she could never be interested in me, I am not in her league, I am not good looking enough for her to be interested in me.       How important do you feel looks are for others. I know most people who answer this will probably not place a huge emphasis on looks, but what do you think is the reality for others? Some people really are very looks orientated and could only be interested in someone based on how they look. Fair enough, we all like different things. But what is the reality for most people do you think?

20090225023405AAxNqBe	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	How long can it take to fall in love?	me and my boyfriend have been seeing each other for 6 months now - however 5 of them have been long-distance, only seeing each other every 2/3 weeks.   except the past week or so he has announced that he can't see the relationship working as he still doesn't feel that he is in love with me (being in love to him means wanting to get married and grow old together) i thought he was being far too serious.   he however announced that he does love me and is just not in love with me - i know i love him but am unsure as to whether i am in love with him as i am 18, this is my first time and i don't know what to expect (he is 24 and has had one previous long term relationship - not long distance)   we have agreed that we will carry on and see what changes (he wants to give a time-span of 2 more months i want to give it longer than that so it goes into the summer holidays so we can be together in person more)   my thought is that it will be harder for him to fall in love as he has something to compare it with and i don't believe that 6 months in our situation is long enough to fall in love and expect that much from a relationship...      what i want to know really is how long do people think is a reasonable amount of time to feel that way?   and obviously i don't want to manipulate him but how can i convince him that giving it more time is a good idea?

20090225023152AANM2iA	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	Does he really love me?	I'm really confused with this guy who happens to be my Best friend 4ever. We're not really gf-bg bcoz we're not yet rdy for a relationship. We say "I love u" to each other with smiley kisses on it. ANd I really do love him but he doesn't believe me because b4 he was my love, I had told him about my crush. And after being rejected by my crush, I totally forgot abt him and grew to love my BFF.   After a while, he confessed to me that while we're in high school he had a crush on me (My BFF)   So I confessed to my BFF that I have feelings for him, too. He didn't ignore me or anything but we became even closer.   We're so open to each other that we tell each other our deepest secrets.   Suddenly, 1 day, he told me that he kissed someone and it was ugly. Of course I was so hurt inside and stuffs ran over my head like "He doesn't really love me," or "He was just deceiving me."   I know I have no right to be mad but I couldn't be NOT affected by it. He also told me that the girl wasn't his gf and said that he felt like possessed when he did the kiss. The girl also told him never to do it again.   So do you think he really likes me?   Or am I just wasting my love?

20090225020130AAmCr8x	Family & Relationships;Family	My boyfriend's mother just died...?	She was only 49 years old and he is 24! She had a stroke at only 45 years old, and she just died a few days ago. She was a Nurse and a great woman who was respected by many many people. Well, he completely shut down over the past 3 months. We were very very close and we talked about marriage all the  time. He has only called me a hand full of times since 3 months ago, but he has tried to talk to other women and he just stopped calling me after talking every day and spending all our free time together. He even tried to talk to my best friend--trying to go out with her and spend time with her on her birthday. I feel like crap coming to him with this because of his situation, but it totally kills me and I don't know why he would complicate his situation by playing games with women when his mother is dying. I addressed it but he tells me that I'm heartless or something, but I'm not. Then he told me that I was a great person and an excellent girlfriend. I call him every 2 to 4 days just to see how he is doing. He's nice, but he says that he needs time to heal. Completely understandable. I'm really hurting from this and there's not one person I know who has been through the death of a parent at such a young age. My heart bleeds for him. Plus, his father was killed when he was only 3 years old. I would like to know your opinion on what I should do: move on or stick with him until he's done healing? Am I being selfish? Am I being too nice?
20090225020220AAmfg6n	Family & Relationships;Marriage & Divorce	Is it strange that my husband has a huge sum of his life insurance money going to his parents?	Ok...so this ia a discussion I hate talking bout but have to. So my husband and I got married a little less than a year ago and I went to ask him about this last night after seeing a commercial about it. Well come to find out he has a large sum of it going to his parents. I think that is strange so I asked him why. He said its because they raised him. I tried explaining the whole process to him but he wont listen. He tells me that I am getting enough and to not worry about it. Well we are planning on starting a family soon as well and I think this is bogus. Shouldnt your life insurance if your married go 100 percent to your spouse? Please correct me if I am wrong!!!

I do believe her...but why would someone do that? flirt so hard with a guy when they r married is she crazy u'd have to be crazy right? and how do i appologize i said such mean things to her that night  and i feel like it's my fault she went and got drunk...  how do i handle this?

20090225022902AABAZFB	Family & Relationships;Singles & Dating	What would you do if your boyfriend or girlfriend suddenly changed(personality)?	Before, my boyfriend was so darn sweet. He is always concerned with me. He is so warm-hearted. He is the type of guy that you can't break up with. He is always my teammate and my crying shoulder. Now,...he's changed. Well, i don't know. I only talk to him once a week. sometimes, once in two weeks. He's still sweet. However, the type when he is so darn concern and the type where he is your teammate at all times? It's all gone. Well, when i say concern, meaning whenever i get sick or say "ouch!", he reacts like he's so worried about me. Now, i keep on making ways to find that reaction of his. Still, nothing at all. He's like half cold. I just can't feel the full of it anymore. It makes me cry to think that half of his personality before has changed. What should i do? Should i talk to him personally or through the phone? I keep on conversing him that if he doesn't want to continue this relationship anymore, just tell. I'm so confused. I can't break it up with him either because he really had his efforts. He calls me every monthsary of us. We reached 5 months. Actually, it almost arrived to the point that we lived together. I don't know what to do. It hurts for me to break with him because he really had his efforts. But, it also hurts for me that half of his attitude to me changed. It makes me want to cry... Should i talk to him personally? When and where exactly if possible? If not, what should i do?...=(
