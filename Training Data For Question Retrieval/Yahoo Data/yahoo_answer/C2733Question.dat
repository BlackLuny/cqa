We have bought rabbit scent and put it on his favorite toy, and had him search on the trail that we left. However, he doesn't seem to interested in searching for it. We don't have the option to run with other trained rabbit hunting dogs. We have taken him to the fields to jump rabbits but he looses interest quick. Does anyone have any ideas on training them? Anything would help. Thanks!

My other girl zoey has been in and out of her nesting box very often but laid no eggs at all. Occasionally i find pudge in the box or looking in there but today i saw her sitting in the corner of the cage. When i went near it she went back up top  and she is eating and drinking fine.Could she be sick or is she going to lay an egg? Also is there a chance zoey may lay an egg? I do know a lot about birds but i am nervous for pudge she is my oldest one and i love her

They had no signs of illness, they weren't "puffy" or sleepy, no change in food, water, or temperature. The carbon monoxide detector did not go off, and there was no cooking on the stove, no candles or other obvious smells or gasses. What could have happened? It looks like they all died during their normal activities, one was in the nest, two were together like they fell off the perch, and one was by the water dish. Everything seems to point to a poison gas, it's got me worried. Any ideas? Our other indoor pet (a rat) seems fine.

I walk my dogs everyday down the same street and my one neighbor who is down pretty far leaves his dogs outside constantly and the one dog who looks to be a collie shepherd mix has a shelter that is too small I kept in eye out for those dogs all the time but today while walking his akita was on the loose i grabbed him and took him back to my house and saw that for an akita he was horribly thin and had fleas so i fed and watered him and put flea med on him then took him home, When i took him home i rang the front door bell and no one answered so i took him to where he was tied and there was no food nor no water in their bowls and the other dog had the same issue i called the number on his tags and he said he was downstairs i brought him around to the garage and once the dog saw his owner he hid behind me then why he took the dog the dog lunged towards me as if he didnt want me to leave and his owner yanked him back so hard that he yelped and then i was walking back and kept hearing yelping. I called the aspca before and they said they were fine what do I do now?
20080929080703AAyaqST	Pets;Dogs	Dogs barking at neighbors, good dogs and don't want people thinking they are bad....Can you help me?	Sorry for writing a novel but needed to paint a clear picture      Our poodle is currently 13 months old and our Jack Russell Mix is 9 months old      Okay it seems whenever we walk out our door (we live in an apartment) and the dogs see someone in the breezeway or walking by our poodle starts barking a little which gets are Jack Russell mix barking now it echos in the breezeway so it sounds much worse than it is.    And people either run back inside or quickly walk away.   We don't even get a chance to explain that we are working on this, they are sweet dogs, have never attacked anyone and have never bitten.   I know any dog could unexpectedly but they have a very clean track record.      They are very sweet dogs and they love people so I don't get this barking thing.      We moved to this complex in this new town 3 months ago and it took our poodle forever to adjust infact that is when he started with the barking and soon after that our JRT mix started barking.      It seems here not many people walk their dogs much less walk so they aren't exposed to as many people and animals as they used to be, except for our weekly outings to the park.   I know they need more socialization but on the weekdays its best we walk around home because if we travel to the park (now that its getting dark early) we would only be there 10 minutes before we would have to go home.      What can we do to get them to straigten up and quit this behavior before someone oneday decides to report them for it.     It mostly just happens in the breezeway when we are locking our door.      Why do they do this?   We've done all the training by the book from the beginning, they've been through class, we still practice all those teqhnics.     It just seems since we moved to the new bigger apartment they feel they have to bark at everyone they see....      Please help me find a solution?      Also we have  been using the water bottle technique (but they are starting to not mind the water)
20080929130733AAs5byr	Pets;Dogs	Do small dogs eat more than big dogs?	I've kept both big/small dogs and I've noticed that all the small dogs I've kept are crazy over food. I feed them daily with the best dog food so don't worry, it's not because I starve them. I have a chihuahua right now and even right after it eats its own food it'll run over to me and stare while I eat mine. When I'm cooking something on the stove it'll even lick the oils splattered I guess on the floor. When I wipe a little on my clothe it'll jump on my lap and lick the stain off. When someone makes a little crackling bag noise it'll run over there. etc. omg! But my big dogs never did that. They barely ate actually. So do all small dogs do this or is it just mine?

My parents got a puppy about a yr ago- obviously making him about a yr old now. He jumps on me AS SOON AS I GET OUT OF BED every single morning... WHO wants to wake up like that??? hes a border collie w/lots of energy which i get but he CAN be trained to stay down. My mom is home almost all day and her only excuse is "hes just a baby"  um NO hes not, hes over a YEAR old!! HE also craps all over the house if hes not let out every 30mins, which IS NUTS! They have an older dog as well- never had potty issues- and bc she doesnt want to blame the "baby" she says "well we cant be sure which one of them it was" when its CLEARLY the "puppy". In my opinion, the dog is NO puppy and its REALLY getting out of hand. TODAY, i get home NOT even out of my car yet and i see her with this pure white bathroom rug i bought for my apartment a while ago (about $30) spraying it off with the hose. I was like uh what happened. shes like what do u think? ONE of the dogs crapped on it... um ONE? NO THE PUPPY! UGH!! Then she throws the thing over our mossy green porch railing. Im like... did u use soap? shes like no. NO???? Im like i spent $30 on that and honestly, either way, its DISGUSTING NOT to disinfect/clean it!! So I had to do it. She was all pissy acting like i was being unreasonable! Then i tell her a while ago the dog ruined a pair of my shoes- which i never said anything about. Shes like well you shouldnt have left them on the floor.... In my OWN room? I feel like its HER responsibility to watch THEIR dog. I dont have a dog yet myself... why? Because i dont want to deal with all these problems! AND everytime they go away, they leave ME with the stupid thing!!! Any advice on how to deal with this???? Im going NUTS

When he finally wakes up he has shocked himself and everyone around.       He appears to be awake and has violent growling fits, were he lashes out. This happens everytime he goes to sleep. He seems to not know hes doing this, because sometimes he frightens himself afterwards or wakes himself from really loud growls?      We have had him checked over, and they carn't find anything wrong with him. The vets have given us one month to try to make him better,or they think its best he gets put down. We dont want to do this as were big dog lovers. Does anyone have any idea whats wrong with him and how we can make him better?

20080929084748AAXCQI3	Pets;Dogs	Is play growling among dogs OK or should I correct my dog?	I have an 11-month old beagle/lab mix, neutered male.  He is the worlds sweetest dog, has never shown any signs of aggression or dominant behavior.  He's usually submissive to most dogs he meets and gets along with everyone.  Lately, he has started growling noisily when playing with his dog friends.  I am pretty sure it is all in fun, because his tail is wagging happily and the other dogs don't seem to mind at all.  Today at the beach, he met a new dog and first acted submissive (lay down), then started doing the puppy bow and leaping around wanting to play, which would have been fine except he started to growl.  The other owner freaked out and said "I don't like the way he is growling" and wouldn't let her dog play and demanded I keep mine away from hers.  Should I correct him when he play growls?  Is it socially unacceptable?  his other puppy friends (a golden, a husky, and a newfoundland) don't seem to mind it at all.

Waking up at five a.m. to walk the pooch is not a problem; it's what I signed up for; however, the whining is going to be the death of me.        I understand, from all the litterature, that this behaviour is normal  but It's killing me psychologically.  During the day, she wails from her crate the moment I leave the room.  At night, Dixie's cries get even sharper especially after I've gone to bed.  I'm sick with anxiety and severely sleep deprived.  The high pitch literally pierces my heart and stresses me out like a bad day at work.  I've read all the books so I'm exercising her morning, noon and night.  She's got a few toys in her bed and the crate is kept in the livingroom.  She's not very food motivated so I use lots of praise. It's only been three days - and I'm already losing it.      I don't want to give up but my resolve is wearing thin.  I'm scared that this issue is going to negatively impact the relationship I am trying to build with my dog.  What else can I do?
20081001090932AAhusqy	Pets;Dogs	How long will it take?	One of my house dogs gets int he garbage and laundry and will chew/eat unhealthy things if he can instead of eating dog food. We have changed the dog food and it is the best for his allergies that he is on medication for. He is getting better at getting to thinks he should not (like pulling a towel off of the cupboard so it will drop dishes on the floor) I have gone around the house and rearranged something so he cannot get to anything that he like to get into. And have put him on a feeding schedule instead of free food. The only problem is he refuses to eat (I think he is waiting until he can get into something but now he cant) when will he start to eat and forget about all of the other stuff? After a few months will he realize just to eat dog food or is this a life long bad habit? I have children and it is hard to make sure that they have not left anything out where the dog can get to it (laundry on the floor). Will he eventually forget about eating other stuff if kept out long enough?

We bought a beautiful little puppy of are neighbor and was very happy at first with the dog, he was a fast learner and in no time at all he knew his name, could sit and come and walk beside me.    But after two weeks and five incidents of rage, where the puppy (for no obvious reason) attacked us, he barked and bite, we where not that happy anymore.    According to our neighbor, we bought the dog from, we did everything right during the attacks, we grabbed him, lay him on his back and we also turned are back to him but nothing off this stopped him or cooled him down. (We never yelled at him.)    He attacked my husband when he was sitting in are sofa and he attacked me when i walked past him. Luckily he never did anything to are children but not to risk anything we did turn the puppy back. (Before the five attacks everything was nice and still in his surrounding.)   The puppy is a mix between Cane Corso, Rottweiler and German Schefferdog, only nine weeks old and according to the vet. completly healty!      My question now is if someone has any theory about what happened?

20081002103423AAJ882j	Pets;Dogs	Can someone please offer me some advice instead of negative comments about my dog?	Alot of people have been very rude. I am trying to help my dog and i wish someone could lend me some advice. I have a 5month old pit bull/lab mix. She goes to obedience training 1ce a week, goes for a walk everyday, i play with her, and love her unconditionally. Me and her have a problem because she is trying to challenge me to be the dominant female in the house. So sometimes she wont listen, she may nip( not bite), or just act crazy like running around in circles and jumping.    My boyfriend does not have a problem getting her to listen, but her is more stern with her and she obeys him. He will sometimes smack her on the butt, ( NOT BEAT HER). I hate when he does this, he knows that even though its not hard i dont like it.    Well today, he tried to put her in her crate, and she didnt want to. So she ran away from him and went and layed on the floor. When he went to get her she started growling at him while still laying down( i think this mean she was scared rather than being aggressive), when he went to grab her collar he bit him and drew blood. I think she bit him because she was scared but im not sure. I need to know if him being the way he is with her is the reason, or if she is aggressive. Either way there is an issue and i need some advice.    Please help, and please dont yell at me i just want to help my dog.Any suggestions would be appreciated.       Thank you

If I must euthanize him, how should I go about it as humanely as possible?

I have kept him on his feeding schedule and I haven't changed anything in his cage around except for bedding.  I recently tried to handle him again but he is extremely aggressive. I have never seen him like this before. He hisses, rattles, and moves into striking position as soon as I lift his rock up. How do I deal with him doing that? Should I just let him bite me to tame him again or is there a better way to get him re-tamed?

20090227171245AAQbnCO	Pets;Fish	Cleaning an old fish tank...?	I have a 20gal fish tank that hasn't been used in a long time. Lately I decided that I wanted to keep some fish again. So, I went into the attic and found my tank and my supplies. My decorations, fake plants, filter, heater... pretty much everything is covered in a thin, white mineral deposit. I could clean it off of things that I could soak, such as my decorations...      However, I can't really get it off the sides of my tank. I scrubbing it off with a toothbrush and some vinegar, but that barely did any work. x_x It's a very thin layer, and although I don't really think it's that big of a deal, it makes the glass look cloudy and unsightly.       Does anyone have any ways that I could get this off my tank, without using harsh chemicals?

She just will not leave the couch alone. And it's not our furniture, we rented the house furnished. My deposit is going out the window... I think I have no choice but to declaw her even though I said I never would. I know it's painful, but what else can I do?      So my question is, will a vet declaw a 3 year old cat and what do you think it will run?

20070529192723AAWzGzg	Pets;Dogs	My dog was born with an attitude?	He's a male golden retriever. Always been treated with love and respect, but if you start petting him the wrong way, or even look at  him the wrong way, he'll start growling, When you try to get stern with him to get him to stop, he growls louder. It is frightening that this is just his natural personality, is there anything that can be done to get him to stop? I've had four golden retrievers before, one along with him right now, and never had a problem with this, it doesn't seem like golden retriever personality, and he's even pure bread.

Stamattina ho trovato un passerotto che era rimasto bloccato nel giro scale: per me la finestrella sulle scale era troppo in alto, così l'ho preso e appoggiato sul balcone. E' un passerotto adulto, forse ha la coda un po' rovinata(non sono sicura perchè non sono esperta). Il problema è che ora non si muove. Stà lì sul tavolino, girando ogni tanto la testa e cinguettando un po'. Io gli ho messo  accanto un po' d'acqua, ma non beve.   Come posso fare per farlo riprendere, farlo tornare a volare? Ho paura che sia rimasto shockato!

20090227174118AAnwsOp	Pets;Dogs	Are dogs more spontaneous than cats?	I understand that the answer to this question could depend on the breed - but I'm asking whether cats, in general, are more spontaneous than dogs, in general.      Cats might make more calculated movements and decisions - while dogs could be more spontaneous and go-with-the-flow.       Maybe. What do you think?       Only responses that analyze whether dogs and cats in general are more spontaneous will ne considered for best answer - no "it depends on the breed" responses please.      Thanks!!! :)

He has always been a rather quiet but happy dog who likes to sleep a lot and has a big appetite.       But recently he will NOT stop whining. About everything. When the family are in the living room with him he whines. Sometimes he whines to be let out into the hall, so we let him. And then he whines to come back in!      I think maybe he wants attention, so i give him more attention and he still whines. But not as if he is in pain, just like he is being awkward.       Also, he is becoming obsessed with the fridge. He sits infront of it and whines if anyone is in the kitchen. If anyone is eating or cooking or preparing food he will follow them around and sometimes bark. Nothing has changed with his eating pattern.      We have taken him to the vet and they say there is nothing physically wrong with him, and all this is quite recent.       Help?

20090227174314AAaJ1g6	Pets;Cats	Everything my cat touches ends up smelly, is this because he isn't neutered yet?	Whenever my cat is hanging out anywhere, and is relaxed or being patted, when he gets up sometimes there's a little spot, but usually it isn't visible, just smelly. Kind of like musky urine, but it's hard to really describe the smell. He's about 7 months old and not neutered yet. Everything I've read about non neutered males spraying says they tend to shake their tail when they do it, and he doesn't move, he's usually just laying on a lap getting his head scratched. He pees normally in his box, doesn't make a fuss about it ever. So is he spraying and just not being obvious about it? Will this stop once he's neutered?

I have a 10 year old Gelded donkey that was gelded when he was about 6 months old from what I was told. I have had him for 6 months and he has been housed with my three jennets. Nothing has ever happened. Well the other day he would not stop mounting one of my jennets. This went on and on til I could get out there to seperate them. The weird part to me was he wasn't "Just" mounting. He was fully penetrating. I have seen horses mount when gelded but never go as fas as this went. Is this normal gelding behaviour??? I haven't seen it again the last couple of days and my jennet is no longer in heat. I just hope he isn't still intact somehow??

It was about 18 inches long and it was brown-dark brown (maybe a little greyish) and the belly was yellow with black specks going down either side of the belly.  I looked up all kinds of brown snakes, the rough earth snake, yard snake, brown snake, yellow bellied racer, just to name a few and none of them came close.  I searched every website on TX snakes and have come to a dead end.  Normally I wouldn't be so concerned about a snake except my 5 yr old almost stepped on it running after the cat and where there is one, there is usually another.  Any guesses would be much appreciated. Sorry I don't have a pic.

20090225072012AA7GS87	Pets;Dogs	Tips please on getting my Whippet pup to pee off our property?	She's now 19 weeks and still hasn't peed off our property, when we take her out on walks.  I'm using the exact same words as I do when she goes in the back garden (no problems from day 1 with that), but she shows absolutely no intention of squatting outside.  We want to start going out for the whole day, and I'm concerned she's going to explode if I don't get this sorted out!  I've had any number of Basset puppies (admittedly they don't go outside to exercise at this early age) and never had this sort of problem.  Tips?      And please no 'fouling off property' comments - we pick up after our dogs and take them out on the headland/local fields.
20090225105106AAspjB6	Pets;Dogs	How do i show my dog that i am the "leader"?	I posted a question earlier about my lab/border collie becoming aggressive and growling/snapping/biting me and other animals, and after Reading my responses, its quite clear to me that, A) she needs training so we re going today to enroll her in classes. and B) she sees herself as "above" me, which makes perfect since. when i pet me other pup, she runs right up and tried to stand in front of her, blocking me from petting her. and when i am petting her, and i stop, she takes her paw and puts it over my arm as if to say " don't stop" and usually i laugh and keep petting her. which i wasn't aware was showing her she is the alpha dog, same thing as feeding, i feed her first, then my other dog, when walking, she is always the first ne out the door, and in reality, i don't walk her, she walks me.   so now my question is, how do now show i am the "leader" as i have not done in the past?   thanks again!
20090225073007AAHzU6K	Pets;Rodents	Should I buy gerbils from a small or large pet shop?	Does it make a difference? There is a small pet shop very near my house and I would rather get it from there instead of making a long journey to those really large ones. But does anyone know if gerbils are treated better at the larger shops than smaller ones? Are they healthier when bought from the large stores?      One other thing, the pets at home website said gerbils can live in hamster cages as long as the cages are big enough. Is this true?
20090225105449AA74k9p	Pets;Dogs	Are the pet restrictions too much or would it be okay?	Will there be trouble:      They have a whole big list of breed restrictions. This apartment is down the road and we almost moved there and should have originally. Anyways its nicer but I didn't like all their breed restrictions.      But it would beat where we are now. The only restrictions on breed we have where we currently are are: Pit Bull, Doberman, Rottwieler, and German Shepherd.      This place has a huge list:      Pet Restrictions: Unless used as an assistance animal, restricted dog breeds are as follows: Doberman, Chow-Chow, Siberian Husky, Saint Bernard, Shar Pei, German Shepherd, Great Dane, Doberman Pinscher, Alaskan Malamute, Akita, Rottweiler, Pit Bull (also known as American Staffordshire, American Pit Bull Terrier, Staffordshire Bull Terrier) and all "mixes" of the above breeds                     Well here is the thing I have a mixed breed dog. She is predominantly Jack Russell (and her pound papers say Jack Russell Terrier/Chihuahua (Dad was most likely a mix......due to her size.)      The thing is I know how ignorant people can be....I mean here people have tried to get her kicked out....because she has a terrier grin.      I just am wondering if we move there are we just looking for trouble?      Or do you think we would be okay? They wouldn't just tell us we can't have her because of her smile?         Just a little concerned with the heavy pet restrictions.....should we look for someplace more lax.         This is a very nice apartment complex and it would do until we could get moved into a house. But I don't want to put my dog at risk.      She has been through a lot at our current place      I don't think she would be I mean she is a Jack Russell Terrier mix. But we've had some not so positive experiences where we are (some 12 year old kid, vandalized our door because when he threw a rock at her she barked at him.....and he ran and told mommy that she was a Pit bull) We have since worked that out....and most of our neighbors know she is a Jack Russell mix. That boy though has 3 chihuahuas and they are terrors.      Anyways I just don't want to cause her any more grief....the kids that live here are so mean toward her.         Anyways do you think the restrictions are too much.       Or would it be fine

20090225105550AAQI4hx	Pets;Dogs	A MUST READ FOR ALL DOG OWNERS!?	I set out to do research to give my two dogs good food.  I had like so many other people bought into the commercial brand foods like Purina, Eukanuba, and Pedigree.  Well after doing research on the different brands i have found shocking truths about foods from grocery stores.  Like putting dead dogs and cats that had been put to sleep with lethal injections and road kill animals along with MANY other terrible things that are put into our pets food that can kill them.  I have also found out the 87% of dogs die due to bad commercial foods.  Either by lack of nutrition, cancers, or other things that are in our pets foods.  I am so glad that I found this info out and I will be throwing out my Purina food and go out and buy some Blue Buffalo since it is the best food I can find near me.  I will be buying Blue Buffalo Senior since my Pom is 9 and my Dachshund is 7.  My Dachshund had bad problems with skin allergies and now I have found out that it is due to bad food.  I know that a lot of people don't want to switch to a brand like Blue Buffalo because it is more money.  But in all reality it isn't.  I did the research you can get a 30lb bag of Blue Buffalo Adult dog food for $42.99 and you can get a 8lb bag of Purina one adult dog food for $12.99 so if you bought 4 bags to make it up too 32lb since it wouldn't add up too 30lb it would cost you $49.00.  Blue Buffalo is roughfly the same price!  Plus since you are feeding a better dog food you dog will not eat as much as he would normally.  His coat will be shinier,his stool will be smaller,his breathe will be better.  He will not die from chemicals and waste.  I used to think that the people on here getting on to people telling them that their dogs food was crap was annoying but I want to thank them for that because it got me to want to check out why they were saying that.  So everyone on here that says get off of the crappy food THANK YOU!  And for a question can you give me success stories from your own dogs that have gained a better life from switching from a bad food to a good food?      Here is a good link for peaple wanting to know about the affect commercial food is having on their pets-    http://www.thedogfoodconspiracy.com/dog-...       Here is a food comparison.  Where does your dogs food stack up?    http://www.bluebuff.com/sample/true-blue...       Here is another good link-    http://www.healthypetnet.com/HealthyPetN...

Especially the little girl, she is almost like a premie, very tiny.  Now we have one that hasnt been doing very good.  Hed barely eat anything last night.  Well this morning he started throwing up all this dog food he hadnt digested and I figured he was just sick from that, however he is still throwing up, over and over again.  I dont know what to think or how to help him.  Any advice will help, thank you.

20090225105747AA8tTj4	Pets;Dogs	Could it be a type of dog seizures? New episodes- vigorously "humping" air?	My healthy, neutered 7 year old chihuahua started doing something odd a couple weeks ago out of the blue. He will "hump" the air. He looks very confused while it happens. It lasts about a minute, then he gets a pathetic look on his face when it is over, and lays down. It has happened 4 times in the past couple weeks, but I have never seen it happen before that. It seems non-voluntary, almost like a fit or a seizure. After laying down for a bit, everything just goes back to normal. Could there be something wrong?       P.S. Please spare me the immature comments on this one. Thanks

I have a 2 and a half year old boxer, who is in whelp for the 1st time (i have had other litters before) My girl is confusing me throughout this pregnancy and wondered if anyone could give me their views.   She is now 58 days, so not long to go now with all my other litter the ***** has ''dropped'' and thats that, with this litter she seems to be quite round but not large around her tummy, she is larger around the ribs and is def carrying high up as i heard a heartbeat really high, but she should have dropped by now and am a little concerned that she hasnt. The other thing is sometimes she is larger 1 day than the other ive been measuring her and shes going up and down on a day to day basis (yesterday she was 26 inches around the tummy this morning she is 23 doesnt make sense) like the pups are dropping then going back up. She is an extremely muscular ***** always wants to be running around and very active (pre pregnancy) could the fact that she is so muscular be why she is hiding everything so well? Also she has alot of energy for this far gone still sleeping alot but not as much as most of my others.

I am home for most of the day right now so the house training isn't an issue...for now.  This spring, we will be out all day out at a theme park.  I can't leave her in the crate all day and I'm not sure I can get someone to puppy sit her for the day each time we go.  Would it be reasonable to put her in our 1/2 bath with a puppy pad?  It's large enough for her to walk around and have a separate "potty" area but it's not a room that she is ever allowed in otherwise. Would this confuse her or would it be a good solution to those few days that we will be gone for 10 hours at length?

He got his left frount foot sliced open and a little piece of tendon was cut, he can still stand on it. The vet sewed up his wound and put a bandage on it, and gave us some bute and tribrissen. Last night I gave him some of his alfalfa pellets he only ate a few bites, and today he is eating his pellets really slow. He ate his bit of hay I feed him which doesnt make much sence to me since I would think pellets are easier to eat..and he likes pellets alot more then hay.    I wanted to give him some bran mash, since I thought we had some of it and since he loves it so much but were out. I was wondering if there are any other easy foods you can feed a horse (oatmeal?) that can be found in households. Please list a few if any. We cannot afford another vet to come by, so please do not mention that. It's money we do not have.    Please note this horse is 26 years old, I still ride him though. I wont be riding him until he gets better, if he ever does. I will walk him everyday so he doesn't stiffen up during this recovery time, and I will make hi feel loved so he doesn't let go. He's in great shape, he's healthy, he just has a hurt left foot. Please help me, don't hurt my spirit it's hurt enough. This situation was like a punch in the heart.

20071210113205AAwpnWM	Pets;Cats	Animales de compa?ía ? comprar o adoptar? lean.?	si no lo lees entero o por lo menos lo importante no contestes.       Cuando nos planteamos vivir con un animal de compa?ía, la respuesta popular a sobre cómo adquirirlo es: comprarlo. Sin embargo, la compraventa de animales de compa?ía es una alternativa cruel, por los argumentos que expongo a continuación. Frente a esto, una alternativa cada vez más ponderada es la adopción de animales de compa?ía. Veamos ambas alternativas para quienes hayan tomado la decisión de acompa?ar su vida con un animal "no humano" ... Cuando nos planteamos tener un animal en casa, lo primero que debemos considerar son nuestras motivaciones y conocimientos respecto a lo que vivir con un animal -y darle a éste una buena vida- implica. Para ello pueden mirar un artículo sobre tenencia responsable. Cuando respondamos a ésto, nos preguntaremos ?comprar o adoptar? y lo que puedo decir es que cada una de esas opciones implica cosas muy diferentes.   Ventajas de comprar un animal             Actualmente el estado de las cosas, podría decir que la única ventaja que reporta comprar una mascota es asegurar que ésta será de la raza, pedigrée o tipo deseado por el interesado. Opción que si bien es lícita, es muy cuestionable si pensamos en que muchas veces los animales son instrumentalizados para conseguir un cierto status social, cuando son parte de la moda: la moda de tener gatos persa o siameses, la moda de los perros rottweiler, caniches o pitbulls, la moda de los animales exóticos como iguanas, serpientes, lagartos etc. Si alguien quiere tener un animal por este motivo, le aconsejaría que desistiera -al menos- hasta conocer bien en profundidad el tema de la tenencia responsable y los cuidados que el animal requerirá para su bienestar.   Desventajas de comprar un animal             Una de las principales y más graves, es fomentar un negocio que muchas veces es cruel y maltrata a los animales. Si bien es cierto que muchos kennels y criadores de animales de raza se preocupan por el bienestar de sus animales, lamentablemente forman parte de una cadena siniestra que comienza con una perra o gata pre?ada cuyas crías -de ser aptas- son vendidas. Luego se requiere que la madre nuevamente tenga críos...y el círculo de explotación económica se repite. Mención aparte merecen todas las tiendas que venden animales exóticos que están protegidos por el convenio CITES y que prohíben la venta ilegal de esos ejemplares por estar bajo peligro de extinción. En este punto es importante destacar que la educación de la ciudadanía sobre estos temas es crucial para que ni las tiendas ni los proveedores ilegales de animales sigan enriqueciéndose a costa de la pérdida de ejemplares protegidos -se dice que el tráfico de animales es el tercer negocio más rentable después del tráfico de drogas y de armas... Quien se hace cómplice de este comercio comprando animales prohibidos, comete un delito.          Ventajas de la Adopción             Una de las más destacables es que en el refugio conocen a sus animales por lo que te podrán aconsejar sobre cuál será tu mejor compa?ero, de acuerdo a tus propias características: un cachorro, un animal adulto, macho o hembra, etc. Además, podrás sacar al animalito de un entorno estresante e incómodo (como es la superpoblación de los refugios) y darle una oportunidad en un nuevo hogar. Una ventaja extra de adoptar desde un refugio es que los animales se entregan en buen estado de salud (a no ser que decidas hacerte cargo de un animalito enfermo crónico o con secuelas de un accidente), vacunados y esterilizados/as. Además, ayudas a la movilidad de animales, porque al adoptar a uno le das la oportunidad a otros de que sean adoptados. Por otro lado, y lamentablemente, muchos animales adquiridos durante las modas están siendo abandonados; por lo que también podrás encontrar muchos animalitos de raza en los refugios.   Desventajas de la Adopción             Creo que la única desventaja sería gestionar la adopción con una entidad que no trabaje de manera seria. Sin embargo como salvaguarda a este problema, existen muchos centros de acogida, refugios y grupos de particulares que gestionan las adopciones de manera totalmente seria y profesional. Muchos de ellos poseen sitios web donde podrás hacerles todas las preguntas que quieras. Doy algunos de referencia: Foros de Mi amigo Gato y mi amigo Perro, Conciencia Animal, Unión de Amigos de los Animales, SOS Gatitos, o Adopta un Amigo. En el país que vivas, acércate a la protectora de animales o busca información en el web: te darás cuenta de los miles de animalitos que necesitan un hogar!      Resumiendo, ética y humanitariamente hablando la adopción es lo más recomendable, porque: no se lucra con la vida de los animales y le das una nueva oportunidad de ser feliz y recibir cuidados y afecto, a animales que anteriormente fueron maltratados y/o abandonados.
