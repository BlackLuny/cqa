20090226140922AAL2Evp	Dining Out;United States;San Francisco	What's a good restaurant in San Francisco to go to for my boyfriend's 21st birthday?	It'll be the two of us and a couple of friends - probably about 7-8 people, so something that could accommodate a group of our size is a necessity.  Also, we're all college students so a place that isn't too pricey also needs to be considered.  I want it to be fun and lively where we can all (including those, who aren't 21 yet!) can have a good time.  I'm hoping to find a place that doesn't require a long trek downtown either, since we're in the Sunset area, so a restaurant that is in Sunset/Richmond/Haight/etc would be ideal.        Any suggestions?
