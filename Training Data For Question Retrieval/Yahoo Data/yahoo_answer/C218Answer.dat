NuvKPl3naa	depends on how old the sitter is. if she is a teen i would give her 40.00.|`|tbeO3Lataa	How experienced is she? When I started out, I charged five an hour. Now I charge 8-10, but my clients get a very experienced babysitter.<br>  <br>  The thing with bedtime babysitting is that, while yes, she does not have to do much work, she still had to give up a night she could have spent somewhere else.<br>  <br>  All in all, ask her what she charges, and in most cases, pay her what she says unless it is over ten.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	$5 an hour plus transportation at least one way. <br>  I usually drive the sitter home at the end of the night and pay $5 an hour or $25 for the evening.<br>  I have two kids almost 6 yrs old and 4.5 months old (baby has slept through the night since she was 6 weeks old) We put them to bed before we leave.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I would pay her around $30. After all, if the kids are asleep and they normally sleep through the night, she is really doing is hanging out at your house for the evening not actually having to entertain the kids, feed them, etc.|`|quNfHZULaa	Dang, with all these other answers I should consider being a babysitter these days. I think $20 is more then enough. 14 year olds are still learning what to do with money, she doesn't need that much. Besides it sounds like it would be an easy night for her really. Maybe you can bring her home some candy or something too, that will seal the deal.|`|QZK2NPPfaa	5 dollars per hour is the standard charge. However, if you want to go up you could do 6 dollars. But if she is just going to be on the couch I would just do 5...<br>  Have fun with your wife!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I would pay her about 45 dollars...thats about average 10 an hour...is she experienced?...or a newtimer? if no experience i would pay about 30! if your kids were a lil older and they were gonna be up i would charge like 60  dollars|`|xQqVEXbeaa	I would pay the babysitter around $30 or so, you want to impress her just in case you'd like to use her again in the future...Good Luck!|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	When I used to babysit I charged $5 per hour per kid.|`|NX6Fs0VQaa	I usually get paid 20 dollars|`|HFWLYMD6aa	At least 50 dollars i reckon. Or it just won't be worth it for her time. about 10 dollars an hour.|`|BRT2teSqaa	That's late for 14 year old...  I guess I'd pay 20-25 bucks for an 8th grader...we use much older.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	I charge 5 dollars per hour for 1-2 kids.  You should ask her what her rates are, since mine might be too low.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	20 dollars. She will be sitting on her butt the whole time, plus going through your food I have been a babysitter plenty of times and at that she that is what they do. That's about 5 dollars an hour a little less, but honestly does she really deserve more? They will be asleep.
quNfHZULaa	Yeah, sounds odd to me. It is good that you are working with your doctor to try and figure out what is wrong. I don't think it is abnormal for a 8 month old to not care for baby food, but to not care for drinking anything either is weird. Maybe you should try juice if you haven't already. She is old enough to drink it now and it tastes so good it is hard to pass up. Good luck, hope you figure out what is wrong.
Yc2xj1Wpaa	When I was pregnant with my son I didnt not know I was pregnant...I was 5 days late for my period, at the time I was still living with my mom and I couldnt be pregnant, so I just wait and waited and nothing, no cramping no blood no sore boobies,nothingggg.....i bought a test and I was pregnant,went to the doctors, I was 5wks 1 day, every1 is different   good luck|`|a8a51573e723f5425e2acc43d7e5f72caa	Sorry, hun....it's sounds like AF just came to visit.  The timing is close because that's about when my AF came too.  Our times almost perfectly match up, except I got my period on the 17th of Jan, and the 13th of Feb.|`|isRDHbJgaa	It sounds like a period but just take a pregnancy test!!!!|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Implantation spotting doesn't last that long, sounds like you just had a very light period and it came 2 days early. As far as the peeing a lot, I do that all the time especially after I've drank something. Out of curiosity, did you take a pregnancy test? If you didn't, maybe you could put your mind to rest and take one. I honestly think though that you've had your period and it was just a light one. IB doesn't last that long.|`|soFpywFcaa	take hpt it could just be your period or spotting..........best of luck
ZCSOJUYVaa	I have sent two of my kiddos out of 6 off to kindergarten, and  myself am also a Kindergarten teacher. I will give you advice from both sides =) As the teacher we love parents who are involved!! Also, the first day is CRAZY, and a billion parents are going to want to meet the teacher, try to keep it short. Introduce yourself, and your daughter. We always have an open house the same week, and often for kindergarten teachers, an open house the week before school starts. Take advantage of that time to ask all the questions about what your daughter is learning. Most teachers will send home an itenerary that needs to be signed, as well as homework activities that she will need help with. If her school offers a PTA, become involved, and if you have time see about becoming a volunteer. I had a parent one year that signed up in the office as a volunteer, and she made copies of all my papers, cut out activities, and all sorts of fun things!! Now, as a mommy dont cry! I think the hardest thing for the kids is seeing mommy leave, so try to encourage them, tell them to have an amazing day, and save the tears for walking down the hall! Hope this helped a bit!!|`|4iXL4C6paa	My son is in kindergarten now and his teacher was also my kindergarten teacher (she's been there for awhile lol) but I would ask her what will she be expected to learn before the year is out, how does she deal with bad behavior, will she be sending homework home....just those types of things.|`|IzHkb1neaa	Most important thing to do is stay involved. Keep a good relationship with the teacher. Find out the curriculm and stay on top of homework. You will do fine.|`|G800cOMtaa	I am 23 and I have a 7 and a 5 year old sister. I was there when both of them started kindergarten and luckily they got the same great teacher!! I know that it was kinda like riding a bike with them because I am her first but she is at the school all the time helping the teacher out and she is very very involved in both of their classes now. Every night when they get home they talk about their day at school and how it all went and then they sit down and do their homework. I would have to say that it is best to just stay in touch with the teacher, get her email address or anything like that to make sure you stay on top of your daughters school work and how she is behaving in class. <br>  <br>  Good luck!!|`|aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	You could consider homeschooling, and then you would know that your child had the best teacher for her education;)<br>  <br>  Seriously, it is not so much what you ask the teacher as it is their attitude-in Kindergarten, education should be focused more on fun and play than academics.  That might be hard to find, as Kindergarten has become more and more academic but it is actually unhealthy for children-especially at that age-to sit still for long periods.  Making learning a chore rather than fun changes their attitude about it, as well.<br>  <br>  I would want a teacher that is kind, patient, and loving.  I would want her to be more concerned with the children's needs than policies, which is hard for teachers to overcome.  I would want my child in a school with the absolute lowest ratio of students to teacher possible.  I would like, as much as possible, for my child to learn in the manner which suits his/her learning style, and at his/her own pace.  All of those are some of the reasons I chose to homeschool, but i fyou look hard it can probably be found in a private or public school.<br>  <br>  Be sure that the school is one that you can be actively involved.  Most desperately need volunteers, but there are some that discourage it.
7jXChfBNaa	yeah what everyone else said is true...they feel the exact same. i thought for 2 weeks that i was going to start my period and i was pregnant.|`|p0prrzf2aa	to me, there's not difference|`|HPRlEWu1aa	no in earlt pregnanc i felt like i was gonna get my period, i just had cramps  .. normal period cramps|`|ZfoU2lNJaa	They are the absolute same, which is really annoying, but a truth we all have to face. The only real way of knowing you are pregnant is with a pregnancy test!! <br>  <br>  My symptoms with my period: breast tenderness, cramps, headaches, etc. <br>  <br>  My symptoms with pregnancy: breast tenderness, cramps, headaches, etc.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	With my first pregnancy i had extreme cramping, like the worst I'd had in years.. for one night and then never got my period. <br>  With my second, I am crampy on and off and have been for the past few days, but it does feel a bit different than period cramps. I couldn't tell a difference the first time, though, other than it hurting more that night.|`|G94NlpZ0aa	feel the same.|`|soFpywFcaa	there just about the same
AA10379871	Spotting before your period equals pregnancy? There wouldn't be a period to be spotting before if you were pregnant...if that makes any sense.<br>  Antibiotics can make your birth control pills not work. Most doctors actually don't tell you this, but the inserts in the pill boxes usually don't either. I asked my last doctor when she perscribed me an antibiotic and she said, "Oh, yea, all antibiotics can affect your birth control pills." Before I asked, she said nothing about it.<br>  It's usually safer to use a alternative method of birth control when you are on antibiotics.
AA10379871	I don't think you are pregnant. Actually, I'm pretty sure you aren't. You had your period, it doesn't sound like he ejaculated in you. Breasts can get tender due to a lot of reasons.<br>  But I would suggest using some punctuation. This was really hard to read.|`|xFK4Ajroaa	um guys just because she had her period doesn't mean it's impossible.  especially since the period was so close to the date when she had sex.  however, if it only lasted a few seconds chances are you aren't pregnant unless it was like his first time.<br>  <br>  i'm sure you are not pregers.|`|fzUP4IAwaa	Could be sore just from regular hormones. Sounds like normal, but still should go have a proper preg test. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  By the way love, just because it last only a few seconds, doesn't mean you can't get STD's and Aids, I mean, really....this day and age and no protection......tsk tsk.|`|P6trt7u4aa	Ask a Doctor, you do not want medical advice from someone that is not a doctor and you do not want legal advice from someone that is not a lawyer?|`|V5JJK8Okaa	its one of the signs of pregnancy. wait for next period or better try to take a pregnancy test for you to be sure. 0_o,|`|HgW2Zwxqaa	did he grab your breasts during intercourse?  he may have just pulled them too hard?<br>  <br>  Sometimes when your on your peroid they can become "sore"|`|cHROCt3Aaa	this site should help you out<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.somethingawful.com/flash/shmorky/babby.swf" rel="nofollow">http://www.somethingawful.com/flash/shmo...</a>|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Think about the other things that you've been doing - anything different, exercising, jumping, when you had sex did he handle them roughly and maybe they are bruised.  If you  had a heavy period you are probably not pregnant but I would test again later in the month and make sure it's in the morning, that is the best time.  Good Luck|`|48oRO9lPaa	take a pregnancy test|`|soFpywFcaa	sometimes that will happen your not pregnant you had your period already but take a test to be sure good luck|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	You already had your period? You are not pregnant, honey.|`|eilBhJYOaa	Are they growing?  You are not pregnant.|`|GGQ0T4fhaa	you could be.<br>  go to planned parent hood
gHR4vlcDaa	um I would be mad sad at any point with things like that,lol its the fact that he is an ***|`|p0prrzf2aa	i think anyone would be upset pregnant or not. tell him to take them nasty pix off|`|35dae24ed321c4c235f68fe8d0aeca71aa	Yes, your hormones get really crazy sometimes when you are pregnant...<br>  but I would be upset if I were you, too. I don't think you are overreacting at all. He sounds like an immature teenager, which I am guessing he is by the way you've described him. I wouldn't count on him to provide a darn thing for you. It would be different if these are ppl he still talks to, is friends with, or if he had looked at other ppl's pages, too. You are good enough, girl. Boys just can't be trusted, plain and simple.|`|sMvWJDqsaa	I would be pissed...he has alot of nerve! Guys don't know what it's like to be a woman..they just stick it in and leave us with the rest...If it were me I would just delete the pics off of his phone when he wasn't lookinh...I wouldn't say anything right away...and see if he keeps putting them back on there...|`|C8E3fe3xaa	I wouldn't worry about it if it's just pictures of them..unless he is doing something else to make you suspect he is cheating on you then just forget about the pictures.|`|hjLzSGV0aa	pregnancy and emotions are like the worst mix EVER<br>  <br>  dont even like worry about it<br>  its normal<br>  your hormones are just crazy|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Oh yes, this is your hormones. :) I am 31 weeks pregnant and I am the same way, dear. Mine would actually call girls from his past he claims he's known 'years longer then me' and calls her his 'sister.' He also wants to travel to get to hang out with this woman, gets defensive about her when I ask about her, and he leaves the room when he wants to talk to her. Tell me that wouldn't raise some eyebrows. But he denies getting defensive, so it's probably my own hormones.<br>  <br>  You just need to calm down, relax, and think things through. If you feel he's snooping around with the women, let him know, and ask him that he take it easy. When he lets you know you're more to him and reassures you, you'll feel much better. :)<br>  <br>  Hope that helped. Congratulations by the way.
Yi0sksmJaa	Good thing is it'll work it's way out in a few days. I'd probably stay home,could be contagious plus you'll just feel better. My favorite for sore throats is camomille tea with honey. Just feels good on the throat. Other than that just take whatever helps your throat feel better. It's viral so you can't really do anything for the infection part. Hope you feel better.|`|XT0sGJchaa	Stay home!

pXSKSS3daa	Gosh, that is so heartbreaking! That poor woman. It really does make our problems seem trivial and silly. I almost feel foolish posting mine...<br>  <br>  Noah is getting his first molar in and he has been terrible. Well, not him personally, just the fussing and pain he's going through. I feel bad because this is the worst teething has been for him and I can't do much to help the pain. My birthday was also on Tuesday and my husband got me a less than thoughtful card so that put me in a bad mood that evening.<br>  <br>  Why is it stupid of you to take Peyton's birthday off?? If you're able to I say go for it. Maybe she'd understand if she had children. I don't know. My husband is taking two days of leave for Noah's first birthday, so you're not alone in the time off department. :)|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	That is sad. My aunt was diagnosed with breast cancer at 28 years of age, and 6 years later, she is cancer free and very healthy. Hopefully the patient you met will be okay. My week is going fine, it has been pretty busy at home since my husband hasn't had a day off from work since last monday. I like that he works evenings though, so we still do things as a family during the day. Hope your week gets better!|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	We've started the teething dance! But seriously I'll live through it...been there and done that. That cancer patient is in my prayers.|`|K5TrkUhCaa	Oh my goodness that is so sad. That poor woman! I could not even imagine being in her shoes. I'm sorry your week has been bad. I hope you have a really awesome weekend to make up for it. My week has gone by fast and crazy. We are in the middle of moving and I'm being induced this Tuesday. So I have not only had to keep up on the housework and chasing after my 2 kids but I've also been busy with packing and getting ready for the new baby.|`|cDVAEHgCaa	So-so.   My period started on Monday, and I was VERY lethargic (loss of blood=loss of iron=loss of energy).  My baby's father was supposed to come over to visit her so I could get a little rest, but he backed out at the last minute.  So I struggled through the day, ordered a pizza for dinner and went to bed early.  <br>  <br>  The rest of the week I was really tired, but struggled on.  I did manage to cook myself some dinner tonight (yea!!).  And today, Victoria pulled herself to a standing position FOR THE FIRST TIME!!  She was so proud of her little self!  so was I!|`|u94HOVz7aa	so sorry to hear about your week.  i have been having a mixed week myself.   my 2 month old son got a viral infection starting saturday night. well by tuesday he was getting better, which was nice because tuesday was my birthday.  well i called the nurse tuesday to see if there is anything i should be doing for his diarrhea they said bring him in and while we were there they said he is getting better just love on him but while we were there i could do his 2 month wcc so he got 6 vaccinations.  so for the rest of tuesday i had a sick screaming baby that lasted through yesterday, but woke up happy today finally.  oh and to top it off he hasn't been sleeping very good at night so i haven't been sleeping good at night.  then when i turned my alarm off this morning to get up i fell back asleep and when i woke up my oldest daughter was an hour late for school already.  the only good thing that happened this week was my loving husband got a sitter and took me out to dinner and a movie for my birthday.  which was hard to enjoy because my baby was sick i just wanted to be with him.  my hubby planned this a month in advance and it was such a sweet thought. i told him the only thing i wanted for my birthday was a couple hours child free and he wanted to give me what i wanted.|`|Q7jMH5praa	First off I hope your weekend is better than your week has been. <br>  <br>  The first part of the week was hell. My son had a cold and was teething. He refused to sleep longer than 4 hours at a time and was really fussy. He seems to be getting over his cold and his first tooth popped through yesterday. He actually slept through the night last night and hopefully will do so again tonight. I really need to get some more sleep in.|`|46tTmMT7aa	I hope the rest of your week/end gets a lot better!<br>  My week has been hell. My sister, who just turned 18, moved out without telling anyone, she's in her senior year and just quit going to school. She is completely ruining her life and doesn't realize it!|`|9vgZNLP8aa	Wow, hearing that poor woman's story makes everything bad in my life seem not so bad.<br>  <br>  I'm right there with you on a terrible week though. My third baby was born on valentines day by c-section (she was butt first and would NOT turn) and I'm still recovering from that. This is my first c section and the recovery is so painful.<br>  <br>   I also have a 2.5 year old and a 13 month old who drive me crazy. My 13 month old just cried because I can't hold her or pick her up right now and my 2.5 year old is going through the terrible twos and he is driving me absolutely crazy!<br>  <br>  My husband is leaving in a week for a  month of pre deployment training before he goes off to Iraq for 12 months. He's also going to the worst part of Iraq which is making me feel all warm and fuzzy. Plus once he goes I get to be a single mother to 3 kids under 3 and I'm so depressed. <br>  <br>  I have also been sick and felt like crap for the past 3 days. To make it worse my husband isn't able to come home tonight or tomorrow night because he has to pull staff duty. Sometimes I think the army personally hates me.<br>  <br>  Ok, I'm done complaining now. All I can say is I hope both our weekends get better for us. :)|`|DhmUgq0maa	Awww that is so sad, I hope she pulls through for her babies and i hope your weekend is better then the week was...Congrats on your baby's 1st birthday!<br>  My week has been shocking..My eldest is 5 in 2 weeks an he just started school a few weeks ago an is becoming very cheeky an is giving me attitude, My 3 year old is copying him an throwing temper tantrums and my 8 month old is so sick...We took him to the doctors and found out he has pre bronchitis but the doctor will not give him any medication for the constant coughing and wheezing because he said that he is not ill enough for medication...We have to wait until he has full blown bronchitis and then take him to hospital for oxygen and until then all he said we can do is does him up on baby panadol and take him in the steamy bathroom to clear his chest...plus he is teething!!<br>  Fun week to say the least...I am exhausted!|`|FUOLr64jaa	Wow - hearing that woman's story really puts things in perspective.  I thought I had had a rough week and then I read about that and I'm thankful for my health - thank you for sharing that.  Austin had a nasty stomach bug for about 5 days and he is just now starting to feel better.  Vomiting, diarrhea, you name it - he had it.  I felt so sorry for him!  Now that he's feeling better things at home are starting to settle down, but I missed alot of work this week so I'm trying to catch up here.  Hopefully next week will be better!<br>  <br>  And I hear you guys about the teething stuff!  Austin cut all four of his molars pretty close together and it was terrible!!!  And don't you just wish people would mind their own business about how you spend your leave time???   There are people like that where I work too.  Okay I'm gonna stop rambling now....
98154758777a4e64556f587f3efee74baa	Seeing as letting a kid sit in a seat without a carseat is illegal, I would imagine that sticking them in the trunk would probably also get them fined/jailed/CPS involvement.|`|HUIo1fQaaa	A ticket maybe if it were just the older children, but with a toddler you'd think jail and the baby getting taken away.

Yet any woman with a working uterus can have children.|`|412167FVaa	Why are such women allowed to have children when they are treating them like baggage.
VR9KhbEgaa	I agree with the first answer, get a second opinion. I had an IUD put in in Jan. this year, had just had what I thought was a period the week before it was placed, my doctor did a urine pregnancy test the day I had it put in and it was negative. When I went in Feb. for my 30 check up to ensure it was placed correctly I received the not so great news that I was 8 weeks and 4 days pregnant! So the urine test was WRONG and now I have a high risk pregnancy because my Mirena can not be removed. I was upset because my 2 youngest boys are only 15 months and 4 months right now, so this means 3 babies in 21 months!!!! So like I said get a second opinion!|`|EYoyBdjpaa	Go to planned parenthood.

I know quite a few people that have done the same.<br>  <br>  As for the gas, bloating, cramps, pimples, headaches, breast tenderness, & nausea...All can be caused by the pill and by stress. Urine tests are correct most of the time. Test again in a couple days. Do it first thing in the morning...or if you wake in the middle of the night needing to pee.

The worse case scenario would be that you're not pregnant.|`|isRDHbJgaa	You aren't pregnant you are getting the flu or cold!!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	Some people are rude!! I wont say you are just getting a cold because my whole head was congested my entire pregnancy. It started getting like that a week before my missed period. My Dr told me I felt like that because all your mucus membranes get engorged when you are preggers (which included you sinuses). I also felt lightheaded!! BABY DUST TO YOU!!
B0bWrvanaa	AMEN SISTER!<br>  <br>  I hate being pregnant too. But I know once she comes I will be soo happy. Its just so horrible being pregnant. Luckily for you, you could feel your baby at 26 weeks. Me...I didn't feel til 34 weeks. You should go to your doctor and find out why she isn't moving..it's not usually normal to not move for the whole day. then again i didn't feel any movement til 34 weeks. <br>  <br>  i'm having a girl too. good luck. <br>  music helps me to feel better about the pregnancy blues. and let me tell you, when your 34-40 weeks, it only gets worse.<br>  <br>  i hope you dont get any bad messages about hating being pregnant. many dont understand it, but i'm with you girl, its torture.|`|kT7GVOosaa	I 100% agree with you about hating being pregnant. considering your question, it is definitely normal for her to stop moving for a few hours. she is a human just like you and she has her up says and her down days.

I have lots too. you only have a little over 3 months to go so you are almost done!~|`|cnK4X2sZaa	when you have a really active day your baby usually stays pretty calm..and when you have a really relaxed day it can do the same. if your ever worried all you do is lay on your left side....and if the baby doesn't kick ten times in an hour than you call the doc. also try drinking a glass of juice first. i have had the same scare b4. but i do notice on busy days there's minimal movement... and the same when im in bed all day.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	I would get checked out if I were you.

Try lying down, that usually makes them move. You are not alone, try to stay optomistic! If you are really scared, go to the hospital or ask your doctor. GOOD LUCK!|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	I'm assuming she started moving again by the wording of your question. But, it is always a good idea to have things checked out when it's been that long without movement. I will tell you though that this happens to me as well occasionally. She has some very lazy days in there, and it's always a bit alarming. Anyways, they do have some days where they are more active than others definitely, but if you don't feel any movement at all, just go get it checked out to make sure everything is okay.<br>  <br>  And don't feel bad about hating pregnancy! A lot of women do, including myself. It sucks! And the BH are normal at this point as well. Hang in there! :]
hjLzSGV0aa	nice you went from milk to cancer<br>  Some women do notice a discharge from their nipples. It is normal and healthy — it's the body's way of keeping the nipple ducts open. It even happens to some guys.<br>  <br>  so no- no cancer nor your pregnant<br>  <br>  and if you think you are take a damn test like every other person would do too!!!|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Your breasts could leak during pregnancy but it usually never happens this early in the game.  With 4 negative test and an irregular period along w/ leaking breasts, I would call your doctor tomorrow and go for a check up.  They can run blood work pregnancy tests there too.

Your breasts produce colostrum beginning during pregnancy and continuing through the early days of breastfeeding. This special milk is yellow to orange in color and thick and sticky. It is low in fat, and high in carbohydrates, protein, and antibodies to help keep your baby healthy. Colostrum is extremely easy to digest, and is therefore the perfect first food for your baby. It is low in volume (measurable in teaspoons rather than ounces), but high in concentrated nutrition for the newborn. Colostrum has a laxative effect on the baby, helping him pass his early stools, which aids in the excretion of excess bilirubin and helps prevent jaundice.<br>  <br>  With all the negative tests, I don't think you should have a thing to worry about, so you should just ask your doctor about the leaking. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|aBA9EE8Vaa	I am pregnant and didn't test positive until a few weeks after. If your irregular then you don't know when you actually got pregnant. You have to see a doc to be sure. I am pretty sure you don't get breast leakage until several months into pregnancy. Maybe it is a cyst on your ovaries, that can cause some systems like you described.
4iXL4C6paa	O gosh when I was about 7 months pregnant I really had to go so I was beating on my best friends door and she was asleep so it took her like 10 minutes to open the door (and for a pregnant women ten minutes is for ever) so I couldn't hold it and it just came on out and I peed on her feet as I ran past her to get to the bathroom.....I know its gross but any pregnant woman will understand|`|AA10867564	actually, my peeing has been relatively uneventful. <br>  <br>  however, one time i was in Korea and the temperature was near freezing. the bathrooms there are often open-air, so one time, my pee started steaming when it hit the rim.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	i am 30 weeks pregnant and i pee a little almost every time i laugh or sneeze.|`|mSyx0Funaa	yea last year when i was 14 i was downtown clothesshopping with my friend laura when we both needed to pee desperate but we were  miles away from any toilets so we decided to  pop a squat in an alley wich we did so supporting my back on a wall i put my bags of clothes in front of me (big mistake!)  and began to pee i was so relieved i closed my eyes ( another mistake!) when i was done i picked up my bags and they were wet ID PEED ALL OVER THEM!  lara was laughing her head off!  and now whenever i start talking to someone new she always says " oh kati remember when you peed allover your new clothes2 and then she giggles like mad! <br>  <br>  <br>  also about 2 or 3 months ago now i was in school and i had to pee so i went into the toilets (the nearest ones were the unisex ones!) and ( you know the pmates wich allow girls to pee standing) well i used one of them in the urinals and just as i started to pee my boyfriend walked in and said WTF  it was embarasing  i was there ages peeing ( he even finished before me) and he was just one urinal away i could see his thing and everything he walk out a little dumbfouded and now hes not my boyfriend anymore cos he thinks im realy a boy! a well ive got a new one now!|`|BNNzCqhIaa	I was driving with my friend to a play in a city no more than 2 hours away. We picked up jamba juices on the way. After about an hour I started to need to go to the bathroom. I figured I could hold it til we got there. Well, we got stuck in traffic. By the time we exited it was an emergency. It was desperate and we were on a busy street. I was driving like a maniac looking for a gas station or anything of that sort. There were none in sight. Finally I couldn't stand it anymore so I pulled into the first place possible and slid out the car door. At that point I was peeing everywhere as I desperately scrambled to pull my pants down. When I finally looked around at my surroundings I realized I was peeing in a church parking lot. AND- there were people there...SOO embaressing. I jumped back in the car and we hurried to the play...drenched in pee. Terrible. Good bonding experience with my friend though...she laughed forever.

ycm5R7r0aa	I haven't yet adopted, but my husband and I (31 and 27), the parents of 6 biological children, ages 2-9, have talked about it for a few years. I never thought about it until I had my own children. We currently have a friend who may decide to give us her baby when he's born in a few months. Regardless, we plan to adopt, hopefully siblings (2 or more brothers/sisters) in the next few years.<br>  <br>  Ironically enough, my parents (47 and 49) have wanted to adopt once my 2 brothers and sister and I were grown. I don't remember them talking about it but my younger sister does. My youngest brother is now 21. They attended orientation tonight, with the agency (in this case their church) through which they plan to adopt. They're hoping to adopt a girl they know at church who is 11. She's Hispanic, at least in part. Non-white children and those over the age of 5 are considered "special needs" since most people, unfortunately, choose to adopt white children under the age of 5.<br>  <br>  Adoption is a wonderful thing to do for a child. Start saving your money now though, as depending on the method of adoption, it can be costly. It surprised be to learn that it will cost thousands of dollars just to adopt a friend's baby! I believe going through a state agency is significantly cheaper.<br>  <br>  Good luck and God bless|`|OQnRP6xVaa	Did you have biological children?<br>  Yes, I had two biological children one year apart before I was 22 years old.<br>  <br>  How long before did you know you want to adopt a child?<br>  As a child when I was close to my uncle who grew up in an orphanage and was never adopted--and he and my aunt fostered 55+ children and adopted one.

With my first it was the same, my daughter was 11 months.  Are you exclusively breastfeeding, not supplementing at all?  If so then it is a little strange you got your period back so soon, but it's nothing to worry about. It may not have even been a period. You can keep breastfeeding when you get period back, just keep p with the fluids and vitamins to keep yourself healthy.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Getting your period back will not dry up your supply. Some women see a small dip in supply while they are on their period but that should be it. I got mine back at 6 months and am still going at 11 months. I know women that were unlucky enough to get it back at 6wks and still breastfed for a year.|`|IkkYOehSaa	with my first two I got my period 6 weeks postpartum, with my third I didn't get it until she was 4 months, and that was breastfeeding all of them, it depends on the woman. And I am still breastfeeding and she is now almost 11 months.  It might slightly affect your milk supply, I suggest eating oatmeal on those days. I have heard that works great for other women and it worked wonderfully for me. Also you period can change after a child. Mine did each time. I wouldn't worry, just make sure you eat healthy during your period and feed your baby as much as possible, demand=production. And oatmeal really helps.

IkkYOehSaa	it could be your period, but you also could have irritated your vagina. Things are still pretty tender down there so you could have done a little damage. OR it could be just coincidence. Hormones and such bring on a period but not masturbation. Unless you have some pain, swelling, tenderness, things like that, I wouldn't worry.|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	It could be your period, or it could be the bleeding that occurs for some women after orgasm when they have recently had a baby. I had bleeding after orgasm shortly after I had my baby, and the doctor told me that was completely normal. It's hard to say whether the activity last night led to the period, whether it was just a coincidence with the timing, or whether the bleeding is just temporary caused by the activity.|`|QvmHjhdsaa	I dont think it would have caused your period to start however if you are postpartum things like having an orgasm would cause your uterus to contract and so since you are possibly still shedding the lining from during pregnancy it is possible that it just started you bleeding again. If you are really concerned or if it doesnt stop I would talk to your dr. My dr had told me it was possible to bleed for like 8 weeks postpartum.|`|uV7TFgLqaa	That's what has happened. Nothing to worry about. You must have been close to starting anyways.|`|z5TPq5eOaa	uh i don't think so....

But ask her what other things run in her family as well.

My husband's brother has asperger's and we have one child (out of 4) with mild autism, but I don't know of any data that will give you a definitive statistical risk.
nQyJFOMZaa	I think there is only a 20% chance each month I could be wrong but I think thats what I remember|`|isRDHbJgaa	If you have sex before you ovulate it is 20-25% if you <30 y/o, >30y/o it's 10-15%. I do know that in fact is it difficult to get preggers during ovulation and most pregnancies can be attributed to sex 1-2 days before ovulation, but I haven't read the actual percentage.
dGsgzRkFaa	I've read several different answers on this website related to this topic.  Many people state that implantation bleeding is NOT common.  However, if you go on 90% of the pregnancy websites you will find that implantation bleeding is not as rare as everybody answering these questions seems to think it is.  If it is only noticeable when you wipe and isn't enough flow to the point where you need a tampon, it's more than most likely implantation bleeding, as long as an off cycle period isn't a common thing for you.  Implantation bleediind also only lasts on and off for 3 days.  I had three pregnancies in the past, I did not have implantation bleedign with any of them.  I have a normal 33 day cylce, always had a 33 day cycle since I had my first, never a period that pops up early or anything like that.  Well I noticed a bloody discharge this month about 15 days in my cycle, it lasted three days.  It would only be there when I wipe.  At first it was reddish bood, then brownish blood on the second day, stopped and then red again for a day, then nothing.  I called my gynecologist and the first thing she asked, was can I be pregnant. She said the first thing she rules out when this happens to her patients, is pregnancy, because this is a sign of pregnancy.  Needless to say I have a few days to find out if my period does indeed come.  But, from the sounds of what your describing, its a sign of implantation bleeding.  Do get me wrong, very rare it can be a sign of an infection, but to read more about implantation bleeding, I would go to other websites.  A lot of people seem to answer questions on here even if they don't know the answer.  It seems like they guess.  I like reading the ones with their own personal experience.  Anyway, good luck!|`|lB405hQKaa	Hmm...I don't think this sounds like implantation bleeding.  Implantation bleeding doesn't last for days.  My guess is that the stress of ttc is throwing off your menstrual cycle.  If it makes you feel better, you can take a test one the day of your actual expected period.  Try to relax! Good luck and tons of baby dust*************|`|Yc2xj1Wpaa	Im confused as well...I have a 3 1/2 yr old son which i conceived in 1 month of everyday sex...(not planned) I am also ttc #2 and it seems not to be happening which stinks, i thought it would be quick as my first and I also did not have any spotting,cramps,feeling nauseous,sore boobies,nothing,just a 5 day late period...i heard that every pregnancy is different but im just as confused as you are,sorry if i cant answer ur question but i thought u would of like to know that im in the same boat as u r...good luck|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I didn't get implantation bleeding. I did get lots of clear discharge though. I guess that's when the implantation happened. Im sorry I cant be of more help. But I could not get a positive preg test till I was 4 weeks. Good luck!|`|7XBoIgd6aa	It sounds like a period and honestly being a women sucks (as in period crap sucks) because this happens some times. Implantation bleeding actually isn't that common. So I say it is your period again but get a test just to be sure.
80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Unfortunately, green discharges usually carry some sort of infection. If the discharges are a clear to white color, then they do not carry infections. Your doctor probably is running the tests just to make sure and since your doctor feels s/he still needs to run lab tests it should be a sign that even s/he knows green is not normal.<br>  <br>  But relax, they do happen in pregnancies, and they are still easy to treat. As long as no discharges are bright red, there shouldn't be any damage to you and/or baby. :)<br>  <br>  Hope this helped and congratulations!|`|hjLzSGV0aa	you may have some kind of infection<br>  but the doctor will find it and they will treat you for it<br>  <br>  hope for the best for you

It could be subtle stress - I'm sure that this in general is stressing you out, even if you don't consider it to be "stressful".  Take a home test or two, and if any of the results are even potentially positive, pay the doctor whatever you must to go without insurance - if you ARE pregnant, going to the doctor now is going to save pain, money, and most importantly yours and a baby's health down the road.|`|ffd293aab0fb04b2c3f99065cb53c6b8aa	TAKE A PREGNANCY TEST, OR GO TO YOUR LOCAL PLANNED PARENTHOOD TO GET ONE DONE.|`|AA11315360	If you have missed your period for more than 1 month then it is time to take a pregnancy test right now.<br>  Go to a pharmacy and buy the cheapest test kit (read the box you want one you pee on, those are easiest).

Take a test to be sure.|`|ySMLLbhgaa	you can take a pregnancy test now. theres a few that say that you can take them up to 5 days before your missed period. sounds like your past that already so go ahead and get one! its the best way. dont avoid finding it..it just stresses you out even more. good luck|`|qM8OZvhJaa	Look for a planned parenthood in your area. They give most if not all services free.|`|G9xNZPXCaa	i think you could take a pregnancy test and maybe you could get some kind of answer. when you take a test try and do it when you first wake up. when i took mine i waited 4 days after i missed my period and it was a very fine line but it was still there.. i also took mine in the middle of the day just out of curiosity, i was felling really sick on a Sunday and i really thought i was going to puke everywhere. the next day it hit me that we didn't have insurance and i started stressing out about a doctor. so we applied for baby your baby and medicaid. it sounds lame but its such a help and a relief. look into it. baby your baby covers you while your medicaid is being processed. some doctor's offices do free prego tests you can look into that too. when it comes to pregnancies people will bend over backwards for you!! you just have to be willing to look into them and do your research. <br>  Good Luck!
kT7GVOosaa	it comes later. the sperm has to venture its way up to the egg. it takes anywhere from a day to 7 days or a little longer.|`|91570a0146f250c792909304f3b1f793aa	im still waiting.|`|RjdrO7DVaa	you become pregnant after the embryo implants itself to the placenta.  But when it comes to calculating how far along you are, you start from your first day of your last period.|`|SJ9lOnCOaa	you become pregnant when you conceive...<br>  <br>  but you go by your LMP(last missed period)  to tell how many weeks pregnant you are|`|rBwaAiYRaa	I store man sperm inside of me, and impregnate myself whenever the hell it's convenient for me.|`|G9TocOkAaa	whenever the sperm from the blanket makes it's way into your womb.|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Sperm can hang around for a few days, and even hang around for a few more waiting on that egg. You're not considered pregnant  the day you have sex and get a late period. :) <br>  <br>  In fact, women are only actually considered pregnant 38 weeks out of the 40 weeks of their pregnancy because of the time it takes for the fetus to implant itself, usually two weeks after conception.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, dear!|`|pelp0RBqaa	Hi there. It depends on what you're looking for. Usually in determining due dates Dr.'s will ask you the date of your last menstrual period because most women don't know when they ovulated.<br>  <br>  In my opinion, you become pregnant as soon as the "egg" implants.
NkjAqQWBaa	You and I must have the same due date, because I am the exactly as far along as you are!! :p Also that is EXACTLY how I have felt too. No poopie though. lol The baby is just getting lower and that is good. It will make you efface and dialate. Have you had any constant cramping at the very bottom of your abdomen??? I have. I went to the doc today and I have dialated 1 and 1/2 cm and effaced to 50% in one week. Soooo I am guessing that all that pressure I have been felling is what helped move that along. She told me to walk walk walk!!! You should do that too. Congrats!! Is this your first?? My second...|`|yDfq0YlXaa	YES...it does feel like that..also, sometimes diarrhea can be a sign of impending labor..so keep watching for symptoms!!!  the baby is really heavy, and if this is your first, the baby usually drops earlier than if it's a second or third..so you may have already dropped!  good luck, you're almost there!!!|`|7jXChfBNaa	it is very normal.|`|hjLzSGV0aa	yup<br>  <br>  your baby will be here soon <br>  <br>  aweeee<br>  yu better be readyyy|`|SEjzMD0Caa	YES, this is normal, I just use to rub that area to try and move the baby but I don't think it worked.lol|`|AA10906062	Some woman will get diarrhea right before labor begins, like within the 24 hour mark. Good luck and relax it is all normal. Try to stay focused on a peaceful thought and keep telling yourself its almost over with each contraction.
Ok0ig2X8aa	The shot is like ever other birth control 99.9% but they are not good for her. They could cause her all sorts of problems i was on it and had to get off it. You should tell her that if she can change her B/C
C6ymnSWoaa	Your parents have "the movie" for "the talk"?...<br>  <br>  You know what my father told me?<br>  <br>  He asked if I knew what<br>  "sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll" was...<br>  <br>  He said, "...  there's no sex.".<br>  <br>  Does that give you a hint?...|`|D3RCNSGiaa	Never heard of "the movie", the talk....Google it.  I am sorry you have sucky parents!
OgzHcNMsaa	No...it's a myth. But lol at Raven. Your answer has me cracking up!|`|pXSKSS3daa	It's a myth.|`|AA12327015	Superstition. Btw, it's WOMB.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	OK I'm trying not to laugh at that one because the baby finally dozed off again. No it won't hurt the baby! What good would wearing a safety pin do? All it will do is keep the world from seeing her bra if her buttons broke. It's called a "safety" pin because it keeps you from getting jabbed by the sharp point when you use it.|`|wFfeayBMaa	It's a myth that many people in Central America believe in. I live in Nicaragua and many people told me I couldn't go outside or my baby would be born with green spots.|`|r4N3R0dtaa	It's just a myth, your womb protects your unborn child from most external forces.
8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	you will have a lot of moms tell you that it every mother will get milk, and they will cite website after website, but from my personal experience, i did not get milk in and i experienced the same as you--no discomfort, no engorgement. i constantly put baby at the breast, i pumped, but never got more than a 1/2 oz. i had a vaginal birth. i would ask your doctor if there is anything he/she could prescribe, but when i asked mine, he said no. there are herbal supplements, which probably some of the ladies on here could tell you about. you're probably stressing that you're not producing too, which can just add to the problem. speak w/ la leche, your doctor, etc.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	My newest son was born at 34 weeks and I pumped since day 2. I never had discomfort or engorgement because of the pumping. You do need to bring baby to breast, pumping is no where near as effective. Sounds like you got one of the occasional moronic lactation consultants; the first one I dealt with (first son) was a moron too. Are you sure it's still colostrum? Mine was actually a pale yellow and gradually turned whiter and thicker, but it wasn't very white for 3 weeks. You wouldn't happen to be taking hydroclorothiazide (not sure on spelling there, it's often called HCTZ) for high blood pressure? If you are, stop taking it. It will dry up your milk supply.|`|cTsb7vFjaa	It happened to a friend of mine who had a c section....it just never came...she had a lot of blood loss, and the doc's thought that was why.  Are you putting the baby on the breast a lot? the pump alone won't do it.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	The C section shouldn't affect whether you get your milk or not.  I had a C section and milk was pouring out of me the day after my son was born.  You should definitely be talking to a lactation consultant.|`|AA11600455	it took me five days for my milk to come in after my c-section|`|QvmHjhdsaa	I have had 3 c-sections and every time my milk came in withing the first week. It took longer this time since they had to completely knock me out due to complications. Over a week and I could not even pump a drop. I had to really relax and bring the baby to the breast every hour. It was exhausting. I ended up supplementing some with formula until I could get a supply built up. Even now with my milk in the supply isnt as much as it has been with my other 2 girls. I am going to take that fenugreek and see how it works at upping supply.<br>  <br>  Good Luck.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I have a friend that was induced at 36wks for medical reasons and it took 3wks for her milk to come in although she didn't breastfeed at all.|`|IkkYOehSaa	it's possible a very small amount of women actually can't breastfeed because they literally don't produce milk, but I think that small percentage is like 1% of women. Also a cesarean section can delay you milk coming in. usually because most c-sections are done before term, your body programs things a certain way. So if baby was born early before your actual labor began then it can take longer for your milk to come in. I suggest calling your doctor, he/she can give you a prescription to help your milk come in.

My favorites from each list would have to be Samuel Jacob from the boys list and Annaliese Elisabeth from the girls. Samuel Jacob is the name of a guy that was in my class all throughout grade school. I just love the name Annaliese! It's so cute and it could have some real cute nicknames.|`|6YnwXCIaaa	Overall, I really like the names.  Just in terms of popularity, I would personally stay away from Alexander and Connor due to how popular they are, but that's me.  One thing you'll have to consider about Genevieve is how you're going to pronounce it - Dzahn-vee-EV or JEN-a-veeve.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	boys i like, Samuel Jacob and Lucas James<br>  for the girls i like Genevieve Katherine and Charlotte Grace.<br>  <br>  For boy and gilrl, Charlotte Grace and Samuel Jacob.|`|m8MyBdopaa	girls:<br>  <br>  charlie and amanda<br>  charlie and nikkie<br>  amanda and nikkie<br>  <br>  boys: <br>  keaton and kadin<br>  ethan and aiden<br>  <br>  boy and girl: <br>  charlie and keaton<br>  shelby and sheldon<br>  abby and austin<br>  brandi and brandon<br>  dani and danny<br>  dani and dylan<br>  destiny and dustin|`|tmTDkQdCaa	For twin boys I like Maxwell Thomas and Lucas James <br>  <br>  For twin girls I like Annaliese Elisabeth and Charlotte Grace<br>  <br>  For one boy one girl I like Maxwell and Charlotte|`|j0RNxGcZaa	Two Girls<br>  Genevieve Katherine<br>  Annaliese Elisabeth<br>  <br>  Two Boys<br>  Alexander David<br>  Lucas James<br>  <br>  One of both<br>  Annaliese and Alexander<br>  <br>  Really nice names by the way.

cIn8BkYHaa	Maybe he just wants to be sure you are eating properly. Being a vegan can be an awesome thing if you do it properly, yet some that just live on lettuce and water is definately not a good idea. I hope you've done your research. I can understand how he may be upset, but you have your morals for not eating animal products and whether or not he understands why he should accept it. Maybe make your family a yummy vegan dinner one time, to help them understand a little better. Or make lists of dishes from restaurants that you like and can consume if you ever go out as a family.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I'm sure he doesn't understand your motivation to be vegan, but it does sound like he has tried to accept it anyway. Tonight he tried to do something nice for you and it didn't work out so part of him probably feels stupid for making the mistake, part of him is mad about the wasted money (if you weren't going to eat it he could have gotten something from a cheaper restaurant) and because he doesn't understand your motivation he probably doesn't understand why you couldn't just eat the lasagna. <br>  Wait until he calms down about it (a few days at least) and maybe try taking him to a vegan restaurant for lunch and while at lunch you can explain to him why it is important for you to not eat meat and dairy products, explain your reasons and back it up with nutritional information so he knows that you can balance your diet without the meat and dairy. Show him that you know what you need to eat to make up for not drinking milk or eating meat. <br>  <br>  If he understands your reasons and knows you are still getting all your nutritional requirements met (if you are) he might be more understanding.<br>  <br>  note: make sure you have reasons you can back up not just "because it's gross" or "how can you eat a dead animal" statements like that attack his personal choices and morals and that's not fair.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	he probably thinks your being all vegan to hide an eating disorder and thats why he is getting upset...<br>  <br>  he is trying his best to accommodate you and your new life style.. you may just have to better explain what vegan is to him..<br>  <br>  and make sure that he knows that you're not trying to hide an eating disorder.|`|idgJndmBaa	It's probably because your 5'9 and 109 pounds and he thinks you have an eating disorder that he's mad. I saw your question yesterday was like o.O<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AunEcibLx82.ulltIF_jivPty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225154526AA6GrlX">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|0b3222142a6140d50a18e4b471b4f9a0aa	well it seems that you know your dad is only looking out for your best interests, as well as trying to be very helpful. <br>  <br>  I do not mean this offensivly... so please dont take it that way... <br>  My sister -was- a vegan for about two years. If done correctly and healfully it is fine. But she just looked gaunt, she lost weight, lost the vibrance in skin color, and she did NOT have an eating disorder or drug problem... she just ate only vegan... I hope you are doing it correctly, if not this may be why your dad is SO concerned and getting upset because he feels helpless.

HBgnkltfaa	I agree with your description of it, and it is pretty.  However, I don't think it's a name I'd ever choose for my daughter.  My taste tends to run toward the sweet and innocent -- instead of champagne and fur stoles, my favorite names are reminiscent of a meadow full of flowers, a pleasant country lane, or afternoon tea.<br>  <br>  I only recently started liking V names for girls.  For a long time, they seemed very 80's to me, but that's perhaps just because I had a friend in the 80's who used to name all her Barbie dolls Veronica, Victoria, and Vivian.  <br>  <br>  I've recently developed a love for Violet and a strong appreciation for Victoria.

I'm not breastfeeding either|`|311bce43c0d6a6dc9442d046a8943886aa	i had one about 10 weeks after BUT not everyone gets them, while breastfeeding...so you would have to wait and see =]|`|Lr3lZ4draa	mine came back at 5 1/2 weeks PP|`|7QxMGgILaa	About 12 months! Lol - I was breastfeeding and thought we'd be safe. We weren't and I was preggo again with in 2 and a half months!
5N3odm3Qaa	That sounds like implantation bleeding. If there was only blood and not your typical mix of uterine lining (you know, the chunks) and dark blood then you didn't have a period this month.<br>  <br>  Go to your doctor and get a blood test. It will show that you're pregnant now.|`|tISVl5Ayaa	Go talk to an OBGYN, they can tell you the best thing to do. A blood test is better than a urine test. If you are pregnant it will show you in your blood test.
AA11533998	I understand what you're saying. I think that's a pretty common problem among moms. It's natural that moms who are different ages have different interests. However, I'm in my 30's and I listen to hip hop as loud as I can take it (and that's the ONLY music I listen to), I play Rock Band every chance I get (I can kick my husband's *** on drums), I go to bars with my girls, and I love my kids to no end. I guess my point is....try to find at least one thing you have in common with an older mom...and if you like her, maybe you can be friends. Most of the time, all moms have one thing in common....they love their kids and want the best for them. Go with that. Try to focus on the things you have in common.|`|D3RCNSGiaa	I am 26, my children are 8,6,4, and3...I know what you mean.  No, I don't have anything in common with the older moms.  The way I look at it...who cares , I'm the most involved parent, I love my kids more than anything, they are my life, and that is all that matters.|`|WxQFe0GYaa	Isn't it the same as everything?  If you work in an office, you feel a little different from the people that are 10-15 years older than you.  It's normal.|`|AA11887900	I was married at 20, was 21, 23 and 28 when I had my kids, and I was definitely the youngest mom around.<br>  <br>  At Little League, Kindergarten, whatever, all of my kids' friends parents were my mom's age. It doesn't help that I was among the first of my generation (post-boomers, pre-Xers) when the Boomers were in that last "better have a kid before its too late" thing and my generation was very small and were mostly holding off having kids until their 30s. Most of them are now the older moms you're complaining about.<br>  <br>  The late Boomer generation of parents was/is also a career generation, a woman wasn't a "real" woman unless she had a professional career and many were divorced, and most of them had ONE child in whom they invested everything they had, mentally, emotionally, financially. Meanwhile, I was a young married SAHM, eventually with three kids. <br>  <br>  So while we waited in the stands or outside the school they would all be talking about career moves, office faux pas, visitation, alimony/child support and bragging how fast they were able to get back to the office after having a baby. <br>  <br>  There I was, 10-25 years younger and completely disconnected.<br>  <br>  By the time my generation ("Tweeners," those born in the mid-to late 60s and early 70s) started having kids, mine were older. The moms my age were talking about diapers when I wanted to talk about homework issues and picking a high school. The parents of my children's friends were making retirement plans.<br>  <br>  Now my oldest is in college and my youngest in middle school. While I'm not yet 40 and just started my own career, I'm young enough to enjoy the freedom of having relatively independent children and with plenty of time ahead of me for a full career and retirement. Meanwhile I see the parents of my kids' peers at age 60 or older, trying to retire at the same time they're raising teenagers and figuring out how to pay for college at the same time. <br>  <br>  So I figure those years of loneliness and not fitting in are being repaid as I find myself in a position to offer advice to my peers on how to deal with their younger children, and (mentally) laugh at those parents who thought they were so much better than me because they "waited until they were older" but are suffering for it now. And because of the economy and stock market crash they aren't in any better financial condition than we are.<br>  <br>  See if you can find a group of young moms at Meetup.com or something similar, get together at a park or something. <br>  <br>  Oh, and no, your generation was NOT the first to grow up on video games. Mine was. From Pong to PacMan and Galaga to Frogger... we had Atari and Commodore home video game systems. And everyone said we'd be a ruined generation because we started spending the whole day in the house playing games instead of being outside, playing. <br>  <br>  Instead of iPods we had Walkmans. According to the experts, we were going to lose our hearing and we were disconnected from the rest of the world because we listened to our music instead of talking to people around us.<br>  <br>  Only the sophistication of the devices and games changed.<br>  <br>  I do have to agree about the music, though.|`|olF9Hl6saa	I totally feel the same way. At my son's preschool  I am one of the younger moms. My son is 4 1/2 and I'm 24. I don't feel like I can really relate to most of the moms who are in their mid 30's. I recently got together with the mom of one of my son's friends. My son and her child were best buddies.. and he recently switched schools. I wanted to try to get along with his mom so that the kids could see each other... but the whole thing was very awkward. She is 12 years older than me, and there isn't much we can really talk about. <br>  <br>  I feel your pain... and you aren't the only one that feels this way.|`|MHOxPs8Oaa	The way I feel the most different is I can't find many responsible and good parents anymore. I am annoyed with all the people on welfare, having kids when they don't have a house or big enough place to live for their family, having problems with the father of the baby or mother, etc.... The one I can't stand the most right now is pregnant ladies and mom's who smoke while pregnant or around their kids and say it is okay.|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	Honestly, Im pretty self absorbed, outside of YA.  I have 1 or 2 good friends, and sisters-in-laws, but besides that swamped wth family, work, and finding an occasional time to go out to dinner with my husband.  When I pick my kids up, Im not meaning to be rude or unfriendly, just more excited to see them.  Im in my 30's, but in my 20's spent lots of my time going out, travelling, socializing, and now just my priorities have changed.<br>  <br>  <br>  Billy Joel??? most of my downloads these days are more like The Sippy Cups, Imagination Movers, and Uncle Rock.  Things my kids have fun listening to in the car, but kids music that I actually like.  And you are pretty wrong on your generation being the first to play video games.|`|DNygQdmVaa	Im 19 and my son is 14 months, But im also taking care of my 4 and 5 year old brothers.<br>  So i really feel different from the other moms, when i go to Michaels kindergarden class.<br>  People dont realize hes not biologically mine.<br>  <br>  I have no friends with kids as old as mine,.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	I'm 26 and my oldest is almost 6, I used to feel like that, but it;s gotten a lot better in the last couple of years. It seems like after 25 you're not the "young mom" anymore.|`|Cg4fWi3Baa	I am 23, my son is 4 and started pre-school this year and I know what you mean. I don't feel I am different. We all have the fact that we a mothers in common. I do feel like I am treated differently. The other mums don't even talk to me. They don't know how old I am and I guess it's not really their business anyway. But I do feel like they don't make the effort to talk to me because I look younger than 30. <br>  6 of the mothers are on my sons kinder commitee and I can just see that they look right down their noses at me but are not game enough to actually say anything. Other than being 23, I really am no different to them. I am married like most of them, I live in a 4 bedroom house like most of them, I have other younger kids like most of them, I drive a station wagon like most of them. It's dumb that my age isolates me. I was actually prepared for it though because most mothers treat me differently anyway. I try to smile and make conversation and I get little response. I figure though that they obviously are not people I would wish to be friends with anyway so I secretly hope they won't talk to me now lol. <br>  Don't take it to heart. You just have to have the 'Oh well'' attitude. Hold your head high and go about your day. As long as it's not affecting your childs experience at pre-school, it doesn't matter.|`|SlBsJ3NRaa	I must live in a very bad area. I'm 21 and my kids are 4, 3 and 10 months. Most of the mothers in my area are around my age and have kids close in age to mine. For example:<br>  <br>  Friend 1. Age 21, has 2 boys who are 3 and 4.<br>  Friend 2. Age 20. Has a son who is about 15 months.<br>  Friend 3. Age 22. Has a son who is 6.<br>  Friend 4. Age 20. Has a son who's almost a year.<br>  Friend 5. Age 24. Has a son who's 8.<br>  Friend 6. Age 20. Has a son who's 2.5.<br>  Friend 7. Age 23. Has a daughter who is 6, a son who is 3 and a daughter who is 1.5.<br>  <br>  However, I don't know who The Used is, or 311. And I like Billy Joel. I also don't go out without my family, it feels...weird. Anyway, I feel different than my friends because they all still party and I'm not into that. Also, I'm the only one out of my friends that is married to my kids' father. There's differences everywhere you go.
i74eEBOyaa	Miss Murder brings up a good point. When you feel like this, just remember that somebody always has it worse than you. Heh heh, after all, I don't even have an iPod...then again, if I did have one, I might have to buy new headphones for it when my favorite pair broke...Ah well, it's just the price I'll have to pay for luxuries.<br>  <br>  Sigh, if that didn't help any, I quite recently stumbled across a wonderful quote. Because I am actually trying to help (whether I succeed or not is entirely up to you), I'll share it with you. <br>  <br>  "If you sometimes feel a little useless, offended or depressed... Always remember that YOU were once the fastest and most victorious little sperm out of millions."<br>  <br>  ....I thought it was good...and funny.<br>  <br>  Hm, sorry if I failed to help any. I'm just in one of those moods today...|`|y1Sn7luxaa	aww im sorry =( wish you luck even though there is no such thing as luck! i think that wen YOU think you have bad luck bad things acctually happen! cuz your like paranoid i think well good not luck!|`|Ei1TcLclaa	That does sound like a lot of bad luck. Maybe it'll turn around and get better!! Just keep trying.|`|e6pr7bzTaa	yes|`|fruO1G62aa	yes|`|5tqh0akYaa	how about in africa? children die of disease's, some are abandon because their parents have died. Count your blessing not the negative.|`|sCuumWVTaa	I'm sorry but you gotta change your perspective to change your life. Just by asking this question I can tell you are always thinking of the bad stuff. I've been having a pretty rough time lately as well, but I always remember that the bad times are what make the good times great. Maybe you should too.
gHR4vlcDaa	why not buy the baby yogurt? you know that is okay for her, and it says on the back the recommened age to start, she has only been eating solids for a month... might want to stick with the good old veggies|`|n6XYYyoLaa	as it is a dairy product, i would ask doc, just in case its not a good idea...|`|537fb036f0d7f523891b1281ae7d57d1aa	It is, but your best off with plain, or plain flavored with something like mushed fruit.  Some of the adult  and kids yogurts are all sugar.|`|b5ae6c4a0700956c375f37b49f896632aa	it is not ok to feed her.. if you read the label, adult yogurt is at best "fat free" which is not healthy for the baby - babies need normal fat content since they are growing and are quite active plus adult yogurt has too much sugar in it (sugar is aimed at the adult body, not the child's - so if the child eats adult portion, the amount of sugar consumed will be about 10 times more than the child needs).. you have to get the normal yogurt for babies.. if you prefer to have yogurt with additives, get 1% or 2% milkfat organic yogurt and add a spoonful of jam (any).. but it's healthier to have your baby eat baby yogurt..|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Yes it is ok. Don't be tricked into buying "baby" yogurt just because it's specially marked for infants. Anything with "baby" in it going to be a lot more expensive. They pretty much have the same ingredients.|`|DLDweOcYaa	I give my baby Yoplait baby yoghurt.  She loves it. I guess that if they can have cows milk at 1 year old then she can have adult yoghurt at that age too.|`|xFK4Ajroaa	i think the standard is to wait until around the 1st year to give yogurt because of the bacterias and cultures in it... not sure how big of a deal it is if you don't wait.<br>  <br>  my daughter is 1 and i give her the go baby yogurt.  they do have plain and personally, i always get her food from the health food section.  well, mine too.  i'm a bit of an organic kind of gal.  but i know ppl who don't eat mostly organic and still give their babes go baby.  it's good stuffs. :)|`|iXX1LjNhaa	It is perfectly fine to give your child tastes of adult yogurt after the age of six months. If you plan on giving her yogurt on a more regular basis try to get her whole milk yogurt as well as one that is not sweetened or sweetened with fruit juice.|`|0UQIdbNJaa	She would probably be okay with little tastes.  My mom gave me yogurt when I was 3 months old because I was teething and the cold was soothing for my gums.  Don't flip out, it was just like one spoonful.  Maybe try that yobaby yogurt stuff that is made with organic whole milk.
DNygQdmVaa	Im int he same boat. I usuallu have a 28-30 day cycle and I just goe my period 12 days early.<br>  <br>  Its annoying, I had my hopes up.|`|dRd5d6Bgaa	Is it an actual period or is it very light spotting that's pinkish color? If it's very light and it's spotty, it may go away in the next couple hours or even tomorrow. It may be implantation bleeding. Just watch and see what happens. If indeed it is an actual period, you could still get pregnant. Talk to your doctor about it and see what they say.|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	are you sure it's your period? it could be implantation bleeding. which usually happens anywhere from 6-10 days after conception. and around 6-12 days before your next period. it could be either or. if it was brownish or pinkish more like spotting not like your normal period i'd say its implantation bleeding it sounds like it  could be either!..  I'm on the same boat as you i just got off my period the 11th and on the 23rd i started having spotting brownish like "old blood" i'm being told it can be either or but by the looks of it it's implantation bleeding which I am hoping it is!. Implantation bleeding is normal but only happens to a small number of woman. now about 2 periods in one month idk how normal that is bc i'm on the same boat here and i do not know what to think. good luck!
G766dQjtaa	It is i use mine almost everyday. As long as there are no changes of a high risk pregnancy or miscarriages she should be ok. Tell her to have fun.|`|HeLrqYMgaa	Oh my, if it wasn't safe i would be a very unhappy lady!<br>   If the pregnancy is normal then it is fine. You would just be careful not to push air or water up there too forcefully (like maybe don't do it in the tub).   : )|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	I used mine through my entire pregnancy. Unless the doctor says no you go girl!!!
nwuL7M7saa	There are several types of prenatal vitamins (such as chewable, organic, prescription, and non-prescription), and the one that is best for one woman may not be the best choice for another woman. When choosing a prenatal vitamin, there are many factors to consider, such as cost, ingredients, and certain health needs. If you are having difficulty determining the best prenatal vitamin for you, your healthcare provider should be able to recommend one that fits your particular needs.|`|xGlqXMRAaa	Their really isnt a way to determine which one is best for you, everyone reacts differently to each kind.  Some will get you really constipated, others will give you the runs it just depends on how your body takes them.  What I suggest is that you contact your gyno, or midwife and ask them to give you several different samples of different ones you can take, try them out and see which one works well with you. Good Luck and Congrats!|`|xFK4Ajroaa	rainbow light. hands down.<br>  <br>  i had no morning sickness.  and i still take them 1 year later (still breastfeeding)!<br>  <br>  they are on the higher end of price but totally worth it.  you can find it in the healthfood section or at vitacost.com <br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  also, i agree with the first answerer.  you do need to check your health needs.  i eat a lot of organic foods but still take in meats as well - i'm not a vegan or vegetarian, just watch what i eat and eat lots of whole grains.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	whichever one your doctor prescribes!|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I'm on primacare, which my doctor prefers, they are expensive but contain omega-3.  They make me break out on my jaw line and I've been taking them for 5 months now.  But they are supposed to be good.|`|cSm1zod4aa	It actually should depend on your body and what vitamins you are lacking and what vitamins you are not lacking. Your doctor will be able to tell you what prenatal vitamin will be best for you. Because while they all contain the same vitamins, they do contain different amounts depending on what you need to maintain a healthy pregnancy. For example I am low in Iron. so i am on ethex, which is a prenatal vitamin that is a little higher in iron. So your doctor should be able to tell you what is best for you. And if that vitamin makes you sick, your doctor can get you a different kind.
AOvtRBU9aa	It will hurt at the begining even if she is latched on correctly. Your nipples will be sensitive at first. It will get chapped, bleed, cracked, but it will all go away with time. If your baby's not latched on correctly it will hurt a lot and your baby will cry since he will not be getting enough milk. I would squeeze a little milk out and rub it on my nipple to help it and I also used nipple cream. You can buy a tube of nipple cream at any walmart/ target type stores for under 7 bucks. Good luck and dont' give up.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	when your nipples are misshapen after she finishes that's called blanched. She is chewing on the nipple at some point during the feeding. Does it hurt when she is actively gulping? or only after the really active gulping stops? My son latched on great but liked to slip down to the nipple to comfort suck, that's when the damage happened for me. I had to learn when he was done really eating and take him off before he could hurt me.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/nipple-blanching.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/bf/concerns/mom/...</a>|`|lfMJPZ67aa	She is not on properly. Make sure she opens her mouth wide, if you are still having trouble go to see a nurse or doctor to show you how.|`|n3IoftMFaa	Mine DID kill at the first latching on for the first 5 weeks or so. But then, after 20 secs, it felt OK. That is just the baby getting the nipple into their mouth properly. As long as it doesn't hurt the whole time and she is satisfied and peeing a lot - it's fine.<br>  <br>  I remember dreading her latching on, and wincing for the first little bit and then being like "Ahhhh, the horrible pain has stopped and now I like this."|`|F8iyUqJBaa	For first time moms it can be painful for the first couple weeks but then it becomes like old hat.  It does, however, sound like she is latching poorly.  Her whole mouth needs to have up to about half your arieloa in it.  If she is only on your nipple she isn't on all the way and that will hurt, if it continue it can crack you and make you bleed.  Contact le leche league for more advise, they are experts.|`|jgtfWjE4aa	in my what to expect when you're expecting book it says that the babys mouth should not only cover the nipple but the areola as well.|`|dI664zW0aa	A good latch will not hurt not even at first,<br>  <br>  make sure that the babies mouth is open wide and when she is on her lips should be loos and open not tight her bottom lip should be lower on the nipple than the top lip.<br>  <br>  You could use a book with pictures of a good latch I recommend "the ultimate book of breastfeeding answers" its awesome.<br>  <br>  the hospital shold have a lactation consultant for you to talk to or you can call WIC and ask to speak with a lactation consultant you dont even need to be on the program.<br>  <br>  good luck!!! Dont give up it will get easier and you are gonna be glad you stuck it out :)|`|QvmHjhdsaa	I think there is like a 10 second period when it is like WHOA...usually after that (for me anyway) it isnt uncomfortable at all. I know with my 2 older girls I didnt have the latch right and I hurt and my nipples would crack and bleed. With my son I had problems at first but we just kept trying and are now doing great. The best advice for me was when I am holding him say we are nursing the right side...I use my left arm to support and position his head and then my right hand to support the breast. I point my nipple towards his nose and then when he opens big enough I push the nipple in and use my hand to push in more of the nipple. So far this way he isnt getting just the nipple. Because i start him out lower and push the nipple in. (if that makes sense)<br>  <br>  Try not to get stressed and if it hurts past the initial 10 seconds or so try to get her to relatch. Also I know once he is done my nipples look all smuged out and wierd. Like I said I was having trouble at first I ended up getting the advice that worked WONDERS for me through our local health department. They have a Lactation consultant (at least ours does) and a breastfeeding support group. THis is not a service you have to apply for or anything they just helped me over the phone. Talking to someone really helped me ALOT and my son and I have been on a roll ever since I got some professional instruction and I relaxed knowing I had support if things werent going as well as I wanted.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|smKfSWNWaa	It hurt me also, but if your committed stay with it and it will get easier! Make sure her mouth is wide open to latch on, press down on your breast by her nose (just a bit) if you feel she can't breath, also listen for her to swallow. A nearby hospital or WIC office may have a lactation consultant for more proactive suggestions.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Well it hurt me no matter how many people told me my son's latch looked perfect.  he was just an eager little thing and had a really hard suction from day one!!<br>  <br>  Just try to get as much as the nipple as you can in her mouth and make sure her bottom lip is poked out and not in.  When you take her off the breast put your thumb at the side of her mouth to break the suction.  Use some lanolin and that will help keep the nipple soft.|`|D2Vkk5WDaa	It shouldn't hurt.  The easiest way to get her to latch right is to get her to open her mouth as wide as possible so she gets as much of your nipple as possible and aim your nipple towards the roof of her mouth when you are putting her on the breast.|`|F4aJ3LTTaa	I didnt like breastfeeding. It hurts and its uncomfortable. Your nipples swelling is normal. <br>  <br>  What I used to do is grad above my nipple and flatten it, then shove in all the way in her throat. That way she had enough of it to suck on...<br>  <br>  But like I said i always hated it|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	hold your baby in front of your nipple, as soon as he/she opens WIDE, latch your baby on... gotta be fast :) also, buy nipple cream! works wonders
NkjAqQWBaa	If there is a lot of blood you need to go ahead and go to the hospital because it could be something wrong with your placenta. I have had the same problem off and on since I was 33 weeks, and Im now 37.  also. It could be just your cervix getting ready, Or it could even be a minor infection that is called BV. If so its no big deal, and you can get rid of it with antibiodics. Just let your doc know. If you start having more bleeding or cramping I would go to the hospital. You may have a little when you wipe. Also, some women start to loose their mucus plug, and there could be blood in it sometimes as well. I really dont think its your "bloody show." If you start to loose your mucus plug and dont go into labor dont worry it can form again. Good luck, and just try and relax and get some rest.|`|HeLrqYMgaa	bleeding is not normal... especially if it is so much that you noticed it in the shower. <br>  Sex is the only reason you should have any blood down there.

Better safe than sorry.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|MMj7YcXkaa	I wouldnt worry too much as long as your bleeding isnt a lot....like a pad full in 2-3 hours  or you have cramping   If you have any of these, go to DR asap.

Wipe right now, is there any on the tp?|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	Instead of going all the way to the hospital you can just call the ER and speak with the consulting nurse. Just tell them your symptoms and they should be able to tell you whether you need to go to the L&D or just take it easy for awhile and wait it out|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	As long as there is not a lot of blood and it does not continue I wouldn't worry too much.

AA11865529	You never know what will upset a child. My son was having dreams about tigers eating him. It never occurred to me that it was his curtains, which had cute baby tigers on it. But I replaced them with sesame street and he was fine. <br>  <br>  You might try asking if something scared her. She may not understand dreams, but scared she might understand. Or just get her talking. Why are you crying. Why are you screaming. Don't make her feel bad about it. Also, sit with her in her room till she goes back to sleep. Try to avoid having her come to your bed.<br>  <br>  Have things changed in her life, starting preschool or something? Or have you gone back to work or something. She could be fearing something related to that.<br>  <br>  If she doesn't have a nightlight, get her one. Kids are also big believers in magic. For one kid, I found a kind of stuffed doll totem. I hung it on a door and said that it keeps scary things away. For another, it was a basket of worry dolls. I also did monster dances at bedtime, guaranteed to keep anything scary away. It also made them laugh.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	My son was upset and scared recently as well at bedtime and he just wouldn't calm down or stop crying and hugging me. He kept telling me "no mommy, no bed" over and over. It was heart breaking because he normally goes to bed without any issues. <br>  What I did was rock him and calm him down in his room and asked him flat out "did something scare you" and he nodded. When I asked what he kept saying "no darfs"  (he's trying to say dog and can't get it out right just yet even though he says other stuff just fine).  So I asked him a few times "did you think of something scary about a dog?" and he kept nodding.  <br>  I let my labrador sleep in the room with him that night on his rug and since then he's been fine.  Since my dog is a nervous sort and doesn't really like being in his room we had to find him a stuffed dog that he picked out to sleep with. Now he has Bubba bear and Albie the dog to sleep with in his bed and it's not been an issue since.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	get her a dream catcher hang it near her window<br>  it catches all the bad dreams and in the morning the sunlight melts them away|`|e5zOkZqIaa	A lot of times if you put a night light in their room, and turn on some music before they go to bed it will help put them at ease.  If they are put to bed in dead silence in the dark it may get their thoughts on unpleasant things.<br>  <br>  However I wouldn't really worry about a toddler and nightmares.  She could wake up crying because she is trying to let you know that she is awake.  Or maybe by the time you go to her she has been awake for several minutes.  She could be laying around in a dirty diaper and is uncomfortable.<br>  <br>  A toddler doesn't really have very extensive dreams.  In Psychology I studied that children don't have significant dreams until 8 years old.  Before that it is just stuff like, "I threw a ball." or "I flew in the sky."<br>  <br>  Dreams that have a plot and story don't usually come until the teen years.
W1xs3vYBaa	They could end up with some form of dyslexia and have a high IQ. <br>  <br>  I have a slight form of dyslexia and an IQ of 160. They do not relate to one another. Moreover, dyslexia opens up a part of the brain not normally used; therefore, if the symptoms are not severe it can be a challenging, but beneficial, disorder. <br>  <br>  Either way your child has a 50/50 chance of being bright, as long as nurture is involved, as well as have a good chance at this disorder.|`|0b3222142a6140d50a18e4b471b4f9a0aa	That would be an excellent question for your genetic counselor, but even then there is no definite answer to how a child will intellectually develop.... <br>  <br>  But if the lucky kid gets your genius, the dyslexia will be overcome in no time!|`|AA11160437	they will be really smart and dyslexic *nod* or just take after one or the other, or they could even just be average or they could even take after an older member of your family.|`|jIyvb2OOaa	you even talk like a genius! wow whats that like?|`|yDfq0YlXaa	your kids will be really smrat!|`|AjqO1aJgaa	If your IQ was over 160 you'd know that dyslexia and intelligence aren't related.<br>  <br>  Your baby has a higher than average chance of being dyslexic and a higher than average chance of being bright. These chances are independent of each other. Since you're so intelligent, I won't need to explain that to you.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	Dude ..My IQ is 130 ..and even I know ........dyslexia is no reflection of intelligence. Dyslexia has absolutely nothing to do with intellect.
hy9fz99Xaa	my friend was in the same situation and the doctor told her it was fine to lift him but not to carry him around all over the place or for extended periods of time. her pregnancy later became high risk (because she was in a very high stress situation, not from lifting the two year old) and told her not to pick him up after that
55ac50ec591a2bbc757c20a9ce8c4322aa	umm well try to follow the food pyramid but umm SHES EATING BROCCOLI! dude dont ruin this lol|`|9bz6EpoLaa	there are TONS of things that are good for her, try giving her something new or an old favorite and just switch it out. broccoli alllll day cant be good for anyone1!  its also a negative calorie food, which means it takes more calories to digest it than the food has it itself=the more broccoli she eats, the more calories she loses..... not good for babies to be losing weight!|`|2L6SQaw2aa	broccoli is very bad for babies actually, u are not supposed to feed them that until about 2. consider taking her to the doctor<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=ArVW3yakF6pDGDGQlR5Fpyfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226194206AA6M4BA">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|AORcLwTNaa	really, its best to ask your doctor this type of question|`|7sqpiGgoaa	when broccoli starts overflowing out of her nose... that is the time to slow down the broccoli intake
ca9dEvSAaa	I try to! Bastard changed his number, and address. I lost him. Medi-cal has his social so he's caught. lol<br>  <br>  To save yourself his accusations I would make atempts at it. Not to much effort but enough that's proveable.|`|i3KOwxeyaa	No, best to face reality and move on with your life. Men always talk direct to us, but its the women who don't want to listen. Take the heart out and live life for you and your unborn. If he wanted updates on the child, he would have said so, truthfully.<br>  <br>  Congrats on a "normal" child!|`|MMj7YcXkaa	no  he doesn't want the info   would you tell the natural mother updates after you adopted her child and it wasn't open adoption?  as long as you had proof you attempted to contact him just once then he has nothing to fight with.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	He said he'd pay child support cause he knows he can't get outta that. I don't think you need to tell him. Let his parents know. If they want to know. Good Luck|`|4iXL4C6paa	I would not waste my time calling, of course his parents relayed the message so you did your part|`|HeLrqYMgaa	If he is willing to pay the child support then you will not need to sue him. If he told you that he doesn't want the child in his life then you should respect that and only give him the information that he asks for. If he is not calling you or showing any interest then he cannot use anything against you. Leave his involvement up to him. As long as he is paying the child support, I am sure you can love that baby enough for 20 fathers. : )    Good luck!|`|AqmJ4vPwaa	i agree, the parents most likely would have told him. if you're worried about court issues, keep records of the phone calls you tried to make and that they were unsuccessful. not answering and him not calling shows hes not interested... good for you still telling his family tho!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	No he cant and ur the mother they will believe u over him...jus let them know u tried to update him and he didnt care to know...i wouldnt keep trying if he doesnt care or if he wont pick up ur calls...if the grandparents care about the baby i would still update them if they want to be updated!|`|NqWl2qlPaa	No he can't use it against you , but you will only get child support from the day you file.  Since you did an amnio, you should be able to get a DNA test and have child support set and ready to go the day you leave the hospital.  If he knows and you've made an effort, let it go and get child support  If he changes his mind, then you'll deal with it in court and all circumstances are different.  Depends when he decides to be a part of the child's life.  On the other hand he could still be in shock and may come around as soon as the baby s born and he sees his child, some of the toughest men melt at the sight of their children.|`|GEfUTyi8aa	No, leave him be.  It has no bearing on whether or not he pays child support.  You made him aware that your pregnant, that is all you have to do..... then after baby is born, get a lawyer to send him documents for child support.  Move on from the jerk..... your baby is better off... if he decides he wants in the baby's life so be it... but don't push it.... enjoy your gift.... you will be forever changed by the birth of this little one.....<br>  <br>  The guy is a moron..... so don't call him anymore.... hold up your self-esteem.... he is rejecting you and the baby... and its no fault of either of you, its his issue.<br>  <br>  good luck and kudos to you for taking responsibility and bringing this baby into the world.... love him/her unconditionally and enjoy!
AtVRWrwCaa	No you are not crazy lol I looked at my first 20 week ultras and thought that my son looked just like his dad. Just from the bone structure and profile. <br>  <br>  Congrats on your little girl and good luck with everything in the future!|`|PKyzcW7Faa	I went in with my sister (her bf was overseas) so when we saw the baby (girl) she had the same head shape as my sisters. IT was so cute and now my sister has her little 'mini me' very cute. <br>  <br>  CONGRATS!|`|kDftsHXjaa	yesssss, my fiance was in awe to bc we saw my baby boy kicking his legs and my bladder, you could tell that he will have my fiances nose and my lip! i have a pointy upper lip and its hard not to notice! it was soooo cool, you can tell what hes going to look like :-)<br>  <br>  i cant wait till my 3d scan!|`|Lprtz2A9aa	When we had our ultrasound my husband kept teasing me by saying our son had my "cuban" nose. I'm part cuban and he swears I have a distinct cuban nose ,and when the baby was born, sure enough he had my nose. I was also diabetic so I had ultrasounds all the time. Every time I had one my little exhibitionist was flashing his "cash and prizes" on the screen. The nurses teased me every time I came in saying there was never a doubt of him being a boy.|`|AA10015577	I had an u/s today as well and we are having a boy!  He wasn't very cooperative on giving us face pics but he would gladly show us his extremidies.  I know for my first I could really tell that he looked like his dad and he came out looking like his dad.  It is such an exciting experience.  I was waiting for this day for 20 weeks!  LOL  Congrats!<br>  <br>  BTW, we were hoping for another boy!|`|cSm1zod4aa	Definitely, My fiance and I were both thinking of how our baby boy has the same round structure to his face like my fiance did when he was a baby. It also looks like he has my chin! :-) (This was also at my 20 week ultrasound) Best of luck to you!|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i did. when i had a 2D one done at 20 wks we got like the perfect side profile view where you could see everything perfectly from the shape of his nose to his lips to his eyes<br>  <br>  i couldnt help but think, because of the way his nose and lips were shaped, about how much he is gonna look like his father!|`|5QDouy4Uaa	I think that my baby has the same side profile as his daddy for sure. The 3d images I didn't think he really looked like either one of us though but then again he had his hand in front of him and wasn't really wanting to show us what he looked like. and at 20 weeks he was obviously still pretty bony since baby's done have much fat by then. but yeah the side profile for sure looks like his daddy.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	When i showed my family my ultrasound pic at 20 weeks they all said the baby is gonna look like me and had my bone structure and my nose and mouth ...my bfs family said the same and when my son was born he looked EXACTLY like me it was crazy people the nurses and doctors were like omg he is a spitting image!!!|`|idrLEQZ7aa	When we did our Ultrasounds with the twins, I could surely tell our son was going to look like my husband. He's a spitting image of him too.  He has all of his features except his nose, he did get that from me.  But other than that, he's all him.  Our daughter took after me so its kinda cute to have one of each taking after each parent. <br>  <br>  Congrats!!|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I had an ultrasound but it was 3d and 2d and it really is cool to see a resemblence. Im having a girl too! congrats she looks like her daddy too! lol
PwhrTNZraa	my daughter was a little past 2 I think the first time we went, she LOVED it and always wants to go, but for us, it's about a 45min drive so it's not something that happens very often. <br>  <br>  We also take her to the aquarium at least once a year, starting at about 2yrs old, and I'm planning on taking her to Science World this year (she's 3 1/2now).  We also take her to the zoo at least once a year and we have a fun theme park here called Dino Town she loves as well.... Everything we started doing around 2yrs old.|`|cQiO32ZVaa	We took our son at 18mos. although he was afraid of the mascot and rides.

My son is going to be 2 and has never been and probably never will be.  I was only ever in one once in my life for a party for someone else and it was the grossest place in the world.

Once in a while is OK.|`|688c403afa0715767110cfa7a696a616aa	Well, if apple/prune juice unusually hasn't worked...you could try pear juice or white grape juice but if she's in pain now I'd give her a suppository.

They do work amazingly well.<br>  <br>  I started off with the same foods and my son didn't have a reaction to those but he has had constipation with other foods.  I just quit giving him those.  Make sure you do the 4 day wait in between giving a new food and that way you can pinpoint what is making her constipated.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!!  I know it is frustrating when you don't know how to help them.  I have been there!!|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	All the folks who suggested pureed prunes know what they are talking about.  Also since you breastfeed check your diet.  Keep her hydrated, let her play in the tub, this actually works well, and you might want to talk with a massage therapist, there is a massage technique specifically to keep the bowels moving.  They can show you or you can research it on your own.  One way to help move the bowels and the other to inhibit bowel movements.  Make sure you give her Dr. a call and let them know what's going on.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	Sometimes a warm bath can help loosen it up, or giving your baby a light massage can move air around in the intestines and make it easier to go, just make sure to keep her hydrated.|`|u3CEObEMaa	give her prune or cranberry juice until it gets better|`|EN5KDwNjaa	prunes and fiber is a great source for constipation issues---like bananas and apricots, i hope she feels better soon =]|`|ACGJtSARaa	give her fiber

That one was taken the day before your period was due, so it could have not been enough hormones to trigger the positive yet.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	take another test or make an appt for a blood test at the doctors office. you should have gotten a positive by that point on the 16th if you were, but some tests are not very sensative or defective, so its still possible.|`|GzMFhJdRaa	why the heck dont you take a test..we people arent human pregnancy tests, we cant tell you...you know just as well as we do that you are most likely pregnant...actually when i was pregnant i got cramps all the time around when my missed periode was supose to come...you really do need to take a test and get a dr visit set up for your baby|`|q0Ju2pO2aa	it sound like you are pregnant cuz the syptoms take another test in a couple days or a week to make sure or go to the doctors and check it out good luck baby dust to you=}|`|rdeEnvpZaa	see doc straight away if not preggy could be an std sexually transmitted disease both scary|`|HFWLYMD6aa	From what you said, you like like your pregnant.

MOsStEbqaa	The woman on the hot-line was right about the plan b pill. Did you not read about the side effects? all you can do now is wait and see if you either get another period or if nothing comes. If nothing come just test to be on the safe side.|`|7xit1ogxaa	If you read the insert with the Plan B it mentions that one of the side effects is that it messes with your period. It is just the Plan B.
nkSRIq0Iaa	NO!! DON'T GIVE HIM HOTDOGS!! I don't care what anyone says about cutting them up really small. They are a CHOKING HAZARD. <br>  <br>  My daughter is almost 13 months old and she loves yogurt, fresh fruit cut into small pieces, grilled cheese sandwiches cut into pieces, cheerios. Actually she pretty much always eats what mommy and daddy are having.|`|5SLdbCX2aa	give him a burger|`|ZgpfcCznaa	The parents didn't leave you with instructions?  It really depends on the child, but my daughter was eating mac and cheese, diced fruit, and veggies, all cut up small at age one.  She also enjoyed dry cheerios and rice krispies as a snack.  Gerber graduates are always a safe bet but a waste of money if you ask me!  Just make sure you cut everything up into small bites!|`|AA12306871	Yes, but cut everything up really small.  With hot dogs cut them lengthwise and then crosswise.  Crackers, and soft foods like yogurt, bananas, and most things you cut up small.  Nothing hard or really chewy though.|`|UQgkWFg7aa	give the baby something soft so he/she want choke hot dogs are fine cut it very small and let the baby eat on its own

The medications can get to the baby through the placenta and hurt the baby.<br>  <br>  Be especially careful with over the counter medications during the first trimester because the baby is still developing its organs.  The medication could have long term effects.  This is when you are at greatest risk, but you also need to be careful during the second and third trimesters.<br>  <br>  If you have chest congestion, you can try guaifenesin which is an expectorant.  You can also try boiling some water with eucalyptus oil added to it and inhaling the steam.<br>  <br>  To supress a cough, you can try dextromethorphan, but its not really good during your first trimester. You can also try cough drops with honey or glycerol.<br>  <br>  If you have a sore throat, try tea or hot water with honey and lemon.  Another one is to fill a glass with warm water and sprinkle some salt in it and then gargle a few times.  If you have sinus problems, you can try one of those nose badays.|`|irHF6CBPaa	I had a cold when I was pregnant I call the DR and he said I can take Tylenol Cold & Flu Don't take anything else call your on call nurse that's what I did|`|MMj7YcXkaa	sudafed, tylenol, benedryl,|`|5oXzYkPeaa	ask the pharmasict for sudafed without P.E
5ZwIASCgaa	You know what i say spoil your kid...If you can mine as well do it...Not many kids out there are spoiled...Just put them in check when they get snobby...you can spoil ur kid and they can be great....i dont think there is anything wrong with it!!!|`|idn1OQucaa	A lot of people equate "spoiling" with "giving lots of stuff" or even lots of attention.  It isn't the same thing.<br>  <br>  I gave my kids all kinds of nice things when they were young, and they were always about as far from "spoiled" as anyone could be.  Everyone thought they were "the nicest kids", and they behaved well.  We were all just happy and loved/liked each other.  It was nice.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, I have seen kids who have very little in terms of "nice stuff" but who are "spoiled" and demanding.  <br>  <br>  It's all about teaching your children to appreciate what they have, teaching them about valuing other people, and raising them to be nice, kind, thoughtful people.  <br>  <br>  Sometimes, too, kids who are deprived and learn to "scrap" for what they get can be aggressive.  They can be less likely to share because whatever they have was so hard to come by.  My kids shared naturally because they lived with parents who were naturally giving, and saw that as a way of life.<br>  <br>  As with "all of life", people and their character cannot be measured by what they have or don't have.  Some people are nice, caring, selfless, people; others are horrible people.|`|cIn8BkYHaa	If you spoil your children they will expect it for as long as they are getting it, I have a friend from work  who is 19 and still asks daddy for money and clothes and gets it, she also expects to get her way with everyone by whinning. It is sooo annoying, and is ultimately her parents fault. She grew up getting money and presents when she was upset and now has no idea how to feel good except buy things on daddy's credit card. It's extremely sad. When they're 2 you don't understand what sort of damage you can cause later on. They should know getting presents and junk food is a treat, not expected.|`|TlFnIei0aa	They will expect it, so when you can't give them things they wont be happy.|`|9W9B23tGaa	It depends on whether you are spoiling them but still have expectations for behavior and achievement. My cousin could likely be considered "spoiled" in that she pretty much had everything she wanted, including a new car every year through college. However, she excelled in school, participated in several sports (also very successful) and was involved in her church and socially active. She was also respectful and considerate of others and didn't hesitate to offer assistance to her friends. If that's spoiled... fine. However, may "spoiled" kids are those with helicopter parents who never let their children develop any sense of their self.  They expect everyone else to realize how "wonderful" and "special" this kid is... regardless of the fact they have accomplished no achievements for them self ("don't you know who my dad is"), and place no value on what they have or receive because they did nothing to earn or deserve it... their expectation is that EVERYONE should recognize how special they are.. and they really don't understand when they don't get what they want, when they want it, from everyone. Unfortunately for them, the world doesn't work that way. Do your kids a favor.. keep thinking of them as special and reward them for their efforts (not every kid is going to be #1... many won't even make the team!).. but keep encouraging them to compete, treat others with respect, and the social skills and confidence to succeed when you aren't there to protect them later on... basically, give them love, TEACH and ALLOW them to deal with the consequences of life and to be fully functioning, emotionally healthy adults. You can't give them a better gift.|`|f96bc16cadcb85b092e0fc05cb19f8a5aa	Because spoiled kids turn into spoiled adults, so if that's where you want you kids to end up then go ahead, spoil them. But just ask yourself, do you like to be around spoiled kids, better yet, spoiled adults? Most people would say no because all they think about is themselves. I think you can give your kids great things and teach them to respect it at the same time, just remember, do it on your terms, not theirs.|`|f1e593fccac158ae80c8df2916388085aa	Thats a great attitude to have, however children may expect to get their way in other places where other adults are in charge like school or daycare.|`|P5ZvEtQHaa	You can spoil your children and still get respect from them. I spoil my daughter but i don't give her everything she wants. i teach her the value of a dollor and she's 2 1/2 (yes it's possible) there's nothing wrong with wanting your children to be happy but you should set limits so you don't lose all control over them and raise ungrateful spoiled brats.
kRaVa0Wraa	tell your friends that you dont need a boyfriend and you dont like the guy.<br>  if they still dont get it...wow. some friends!|`|FZQ2KHDvaa	You will eventually want to date.<br>  <br>  But for now, I applaud your position.|`|VWaSojThaa	well if you don't want to then don't, its not necessary to have a bf at this age its normal if you don't i didn't have one until i was 15, thats just your choice.

If they're really your friends they'll understand. You'll date when you feel you're ready it's as simple as that :)|`|i74eEBOyaa	Hahaha, I thought I would have to search high and low for someone who had the same mindset as me...Granted, your grades are higher than mine, but hey, who needs math? Now on to the actual 'advice'.<br>  <br>  Don't convert. Last time I checked, school was for, well, taking tests, and all that other non-glorious crap...(like homework (grr, I dislike homework)), not finding that 'perfect someone'. I'm not sure about your sense of humor, so, if you are kinda depressed, I wouldn't recommend reading the quote I am about to lay down in front of you.<br>  <br>  "There must be millions of people all over the world who never get any love letters . . . I could be their leader."<br>  <br>  So, basically, if your 'friends' are pressuring you into getting a boyfriend...drop everything and run. After all, they can't possible be your real friends. Real friends won't pressure you into doing something that you quite clearly don't want to do. Besides, there are more people like you out there (and more than likely, you will find them located in your school). <br>  <br>  Okay, I'm done. I think if I was going to be of any help to you, you would have already found said help.<br>  <br>  EDIT: So many people replied in the time it took me to type my bit.....Back to typing class I go, as I clearly need to learn how to type faster.|`|Ei1TcLclaa	Just tell your friends that you don't want or need a boyfriend and that you really wanna focus on your grades and your friendship with the boy. I have seen good friendships broken when a boy and girl who were real close friends started to go out. Trust me. If you're not ready, then you're not ready. I didn't having a boyfriend until I was 17 because I was all focused on school. Just do what you want!!<br>  Kryssah|`|td0Dz1LRaa	trust me, at your age. a bf may SEEM like the "cool" thing to do, but honestly, it could possibly the the worst.<br>  You should enjoy your young teenage years. have fun. because once you get a bf most of that is going to change. having a bf is not easy at times. & if you and your bf happen to break up, then you will experience heartbreak. one of the worst things you could experience. and you most definitely dont wanna deal with this at such a young age.<br>  <br>  Dont worry about what your friends do. do well in school. having a bf will just be a distraction,<br>  && if this guy really has a thing for you, then he will be willing to wait until your ready to be in a relationship :)<br>  <br>  patience.<br>  enjoy the single life. its the best<br>  <3

BZJGNFymaa	Ugh, a nickname doesn't do you any good if you don't earn it from your friends or family... the whole point is to have a history to it, a story of how you got it.  "The internet gave it to me" does not make you seem cool.<br>  <br>  But, if you must have one, here are a few ideas...<br>  <br>  *Something based on the color of your eyes, like Blu-Blu or Sky.<br>  <br>  *Something based on a physical characteristic, with a silly touch, like "Crazy Legs."<br>  <br>  *Something based on your last name, like a shortened version of it, like "Go-Go" for Gonzales, or "Johnny" for Johnson... boys names make cute nicknames for girls.<br>  <br>  *Something based on a hobby or passion - the last name of your favorite (or most hated!) author, such as Dickens or Hemingway.<br>  <br>  *Take a piece of your name, first, last, or middle, and stick "y" onto it.  If your last name is Jones, go by "Jonesy."<br>  <br>  I hope this helped, but remember... a nickname is only as good as the story that goes with it.|`|CHCPnvksaa	snapo puspie.|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	Spyder or Clarkette|`|W8GMnYMZaa	It's kind of weird to come up with a nickname for yourself.

GNLYxY7kaa	hey there, i had the same exact problem (colic) with my son from when he was 1-4 months. we used that enfamil iron formula but had to switch many many times until we stuck with similac sensitive rs. my doc said it takes two weeks to see the full effect of how a formula will be handled by the babys system. you can use those drops before, after, or during each feeding. the drops dont get absorbed into the bloodstream so you cant 'over dose' the baby. i believe on the package it says use as needed but no more than 12 times a day. try to burp your baby as much as possible, rub his little belly, rock him back and forth laying him on your knees....give him LOTS of warm baths. The warm baths saved me!!! Sometimes it was the only thing that calmed him down. He would be so gassy and upset but as soon as I layed him in a nice WARM bath, he was as happy as can be. Keep that in mind for when nothing else is working...see if it helps your lil fella too. i know how upsetting colic can be, just hang in there. the gas gets better around 5 months when they move around more and can fart better. take care, god bless, and congrats on your babes|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	YES! as long as you don't give more than 12 dosages a day! so technically, you can give your baby the drops every 2 hours! i give them to my baby at EVERY feeding<br>  <br>  <br>  *add<br>  i've tried mylicon and little tummys. little tummys worked wonders for my baby.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	supposedly the gas drops are safe for every feeding, but i didn't want to do that. after talking with our peditritian, we switched to enfamil gentlease and it worked like a charm. her tummy was no longer hard and she was less gassy and cranky.|`|5ZwIASCgaa	Mylicon works good and u can put it in every bottle if u wanted to im not sure about little tummies its probably the same thing but read the box to see...try burbing her more frequently like every ounce then feed her sitting in and upright position...try burbing her if she is crying to crying can cause gas!|`|QvmHjhdsaa	I've never personally used the little tummies stuff but I love the mylicon drops for when the baby has gas.....worked great with my 2 girls but my newborn son HATES the taste|`|u94HOVz7aa	i use dr. browns bottles andthey work great for helping eliminating gas|`|P055DfvBaa	My daughter was the same way.  Everybaby is different, so you will probably have to try different things.  The gas drops dont work.  Its a cheap gimmick to make a buck.  2 things that might work:  try changing formula.  Similac worked for and then we switched to Target named brand.  And the one thing that I will tell you to do right now is Prune Juice.  My wife and I did this for about 2 months and it was the only thing that stopped her gas.  When we stopped, she gassed again so we put her back on.  Usually put a teaspoon in an 8 oz. bottle.  It worked for us.
NqWl2qlPaa	You may have had a miscarriage, but most women have miscarriages early on and never know about it. Check out these statistics, it says that 40% of conceptions end in miscarriage.|`|T48smu01aa	Just sounds like change in period.....your period can change as you get older and sometimes you periods will get lighter if they were heavy or haevy if they were lighter.....it sounds normal to me..<br>  Good luck sweeite|`|DSSZZBTXaa	i had a few periods that were like tht and than my last few have been light and short but im not pregnant. so its probably just your body messing around :)<br>  <br>  <br>  oh and your parents can NOT view your medical records....even if you are a minor and you tell the dr not to say anything to your parents by law they can't. especially if your of age and are on your parents insurance and even if your married and your spouse wanted to know what was wrong with you they still cant tell them...only YOU can tell whom ever what is wrong with you. and if the drs do tell or send out your charts without your permission you can legally sue them bcuz its against HIPAA law (confidentuality law) for them to give out any information with your permission.|`|ZHJuK1QNaa	I don't think you have anything to worry about.  Periods can change all the time due to a lot of different factors, other than pregnancy.  Hormones fluctuate all the time, these fluctuations can effect your periods in many different ways.  You may bleed and cramp harder one month. The next month you may not have as much bleeding or cramping but your period may last longer.  These changes are totally normal.  If you are having your periods, you are not pregnant. Every month the lining of your uterus grows, when this lining is released, that release is your period.  If you become pregnant that lining stays in place and you won't have a period.  <br>  Being young, unmarried  and pregnant is a scary thing. So if you don't want to have that worry anymore, don't have sex until you are married.<br>  Having sex before you are ready can bring about many things other than pregnancy.  You are running a risk of many different diseases, not to mention the broken heart you will suffer from feeling used.  There are so many things to worry about as you grow up, an unwanted pregnancy is one thing that you can totally avoid by not having sex.|`|AA11315360	First you cant get pregnant unless you are having sex without birth control pills and without using condoms. If the guy ejaculates inside of you then yes you can get pregnant. <br>  If you dont want to get pregnant start insisting on using condoms every time (they cost very little at Walmart.  Buy trojan brand they dont break.).<br>  Also go to your doctor or a planned parenthood location (they have a website i think it is www.plannedparenthood.com) and get birth control pills.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Your not pregnant. Get on birth control. You won't need to worry then. If you parents ask just say you want it to clear your skin up. lol.|`|GmTs1BB1aa	pleaseeee thats nothing to worry about.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	I think your cycle is just going a little crazy.  Its still lasting a good number of days, I wouldn't worry unless it lasted for something like 2 or 3 days.  You took 7 pregnancy tests and they all showed negative...im sure your not pregnant, just really nervous.  Maybe you should get on birth control to both ease your mind and help regulate your period.  It will also help a lot with cramping.|`|eS7iQCziaa	Not anything to worry about. Periods change and you took a million pregnancy test. Odds are you good.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	It doesnt sound like your pregnant to me.
Z8Ui1ugLaa	This is an answer that only you and your boyfriend can make and really it's up to you. It's your body and when push comes to shove, your boyfriend can easily slip out of the picture.  <br>  <br>  Any decision you make will change your life, any decision you make will make you a more responsible person, and decision you make will make you grow up really quick.|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Start taking some prenatal vitamins and some vitamin C and then call a midwife and enjoy your pregnancy and your new baby.  If you are still a teenager start talking with your parents and let them know what is going on.  Over the course of the next 9 months you will start to figure things out and start growing up a bit more than you are now.  You've created a life that's growing inside you.

I myself am opposed to abortion, but to each their own. Adoption is a beautiful blessing for many people who can't have their own children. You two need to discuss what option you feel best with. Are you ready to take on the responsibility of being parents? I imagine it must be a scary thing to find out you are pregnant when you were not planning on it, but there are several options out there. Just take a deep breath and choose what works best for the two of you.|`|xFK4Ajroaa	start working yoru butt off and save as much money as you can so you can take at least the first two weeks off together and enjoy the sweet new life you have brought into this world.<br>  <br>  and don't panic.  everything happens for a reason. :)  it'll be okay.  the idea will totally grow on you!|`|tISVl5Ayaa	Have the kid if you have a relationship, or get an abortion.

SnQvsOPwaa	This is pretty common for an 11 year old boy. You need to sit down with him and talk him through his home work. Does he have an agenda book? does the school have a website where you can go to see what his work is. You need to make sure he has his work every day. Set up a game plane for how he will do it. Have him double check his work in front of you when he's done. Help get and stay organized.|`|7SKVCPcSaa	maybe he needs help with his homework.. maybe he doesn't do it because he doesn't understand it.. talk to him about why he doesn't want to do his work. . its not just because he is lazy.. there has to be an underlying reason.|`|RI1brp91aa	Okay, well when he gets home ask if he has any homework, if he says no than check his backpack.

Give him the one-two punch and make sure he feels it.|`|1bc954558a35cac62ae741987c1dd12eaa	I have an 11 year old daughter who used to not like doing homework.  It was just a matter of spending more time with her - I sit with her and she does her work while I read; I'd give her a time - like 20 minutes on this math, then 15 on the writing, etc.  Talk to his teacher and find out how he's doing in class - is he also disinterested in class?  There has got to be reason - perhaps lack of confidence and self esteem?  I know this might sound too much - but it really isn't. Give him MORE homework.  I did, and it worked.  My daughter just needed to feel confident in her abilities and work independently - I found www.time4learning.com - you do pay a small monthly fee but by far it's the best independent educational tool I've come across - it's better than any of the educational computer programs I've found - even better than the high priced ones.  My daughter sits and works for at least an hour - she learns -- it's interactive and it's fun.  A really great in-between electronic video game and educational computer software.  Look it up, you and he will love it.|`|8bFgKg99aa	Beat his butt
gHR4vlcDaa	well how old is he? that is the first thing we need to find out!|`|fd34d7830f1987fa091fa8de50613944aa	Sometimes my son does this. He will wake up and want to cuddle, so we pick him up and rock him and then try the bottle once he is more settled.

He may just want to feel closer to you.|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	Well, knowing how old he is would be helpful.  Also, a little info about what you do with him between the time you offer the bottle the first time and the second would be helpful.

Not really enough info to give decent advice...<br>  Good Luck|`|yfAL4wt4aa	are you sure he is crying for the bottle? my son use to do this until i realised he wasnt crying for the bottle he just needed to be resettled and when he woke again he was ready for the bottle straight away but he was 6 months old i dont know how old ur bubba is...|`|jPU2WaHnaa	May Be  He does not want the bottle at all Babys can cry for many reasons / He might not be able to See you and Just wants to be held looked at given a funny face,may want to move around with you or be Burped|`|oDGpmkMaaa	do you heat the bottle before you give it to him? maybe he just likes it on the cooler side.
vrt8bMzVaa	you have to ovulate to get pregnant and if you are not having a period then you are not ovulating|`|F8iyUqJBaa	The whole point of a period is to slough off the built up uterine lining, if you were to get pregnant while not having periods you'd likely miscarry.  If you are still not having periods though you really need to go back to a doctor, that's not healthy.  That happened to me for a year and it turned out I had a tumor in my brain that was sitting on my pituitary gland(the one that makes a woman function like a woman) and they had to put me on medication and eventually have surgery to remove it|`|uSatSrVOaa	Not sure honey. My suggestion would be to go to the doctor, explain that you haven't had a period in years, and you've tried pills that were meant to get you on a schedule. Make sure you don't leave out any details, as often times it's the details that tell the difference between one thing and another.
FgPZ8Sl8aa	Let's first get a few things out of the way. <br>  <br>  - Marijuana is not responsible for any deaths in the history of it's known use.<br>  - Even smoked marijuana has no link to any form of cancer.<br>  - Marijuana is a relatively benign substance.<br>  <br>  Smoking it, however, is still not a healthy act even if it won't cause cancer. Marijuana edibles are a much safer method of ingesting marijuana. Similarly, vaporizing is a safer method of taking advantage of marijuana without having to smoke it and it's much easier than cooking it.|`|r39EDGhPaa	Lmao.<br>  It takes forever to make those, so if you're considering it, good luck.  And it's gonna stink up your entire house.<br>  <br>  Neither are dangerous to begin with.|`|kRaVa0Wraa	yes. because youre not putting smoke in your lungs.|`|93r3nCM1aa	harmful chemicals? HAHAHA! Marijuana is a plant. It doesn't have nicotine, tar, and arsenic like cigarette smoke.<br>  <br>  Eating it is probably better just because you aren't inhaling. Anytime you inhale anything into your lungs, from air freshener to smoke, it's harmful. However, it takes longer to work if you ingest it. <br>  <br>  Honestly, I'd be more concerned about the caloric intake of eating the brownie than the effects of pot.|`|JZMfUDylaa	Marijuana isn't as dangerous as people say it is. The only reason why people say its dangerous is cause of the propaganda from the media. and what is the media known for? rumors and lies with everything. tobacco and booze is 10 time dangerous than pot itself. Ever heard of anyone over dosing on pot? nope! not possible! take a look at this website hun: norml.com it tells you TRUE facts of marijuana. keep smoking this is america land of the free and it's your right to do what you want with your body! PEACE AND LOVE!|`|tnhF5Gaiaa	I would think so since the smoke isn't getting to your lungs, I don't think it is safer, but I don't consider smoking pot dangerous.|`|52otNiElaa	Yeah because your lungs are out of the equation.|`|8146e347ad7537c819ea87c18358a194aa	Yes because your not inhaling the smoke. weed is completely harmless if you eat it or you use a vaporizer (witch is the healthiest and most effective way of smoking because your inhaling nothing but the THC)|`|LA2nJToYaa	Yes and no. <br>  <br>  Yes because you are not smoking the weed and no because you are ingesting the weed.<br>  <br>  Ingesting it is going to give you a much different kind of high...that could lead to some very bad things. Like heartburn, heavy stomach cramps, constipation/diarreha, bowl obstructions, ulcers, etc.|`|DiZh2XC2aa	It's never healthy...so I'm going to say no.  I hope this isn't your problem.  If it is, seek help...I'm not going to judge you but some counseling/talking to a trusted teacher/older adultish friend could work a world of wonders.  You'd be suprised where you'd get.<br>  <br>  Ema|`|bTMdpMW9aa	I believe it's the same exact risk. Nothing bad will happen to you if that's what you're worried about. Plus weed brownies and cookies are so bomb. I suggest it.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	Technically yes if there isn't any pesticides and if it's pure marijuana.|`|wnVGeG8uaa	Its safer, but you will be A LOT higher.|`|mbbBfKTtaa	ye!|`|fruO1G62aa	I think it is.... because smoking makes you take it in and if you eat it it goes to your stoma

twVyisGnaa	Well, all I can say is that your mom is basically being pretty neglectful to her family.  Hanging out with friends is fun, but not every freaking day!  Plus, they're not even respectful of your house and property, so they're just making your own home worse!  It's causing your mom to neglect your family and taking away time from her husband and the children.  What you need to do is some sort of family intervention.  She needs to get it through her head that she's making the family feel uncomfortable and alone, and with very minimal privacy in their own  home.  Get her to completely stop spending time with her friends for a couple days.  Take her out as a family and maybe go eat at a restaurant or you guys can all watch a movie together and talk about your days.  Just only your family members.  No friends whatsoever.  Ask her to hang out with some of the kids individually or something.  Try to ask her if she can slow down with the whole inviting friends over thing.  Oh, and the next time she made a promise to your dad or you kids, make sure she fulfills her promise!  Good luck!<br>  <br>  VIVA LA RAZA!|`|FLpMShKNaa	Sounds like she has a serious problem, perhaps with alcohol, I hope your dad and maybe your twin can get her some help. If not, try and get some help for yourself, maybe the branch of alcoholics anonymous for family members of drinkers. Its too much for someone your age to bear alone. God bless and good luck.|`|CAKMLUfCaa	You know what.. If i had time to read it... I would... But i dont... Sorry..LOL!!! Seems like you have something to get off you chest.|`|XuGFt3boaa	Wow.  I hate to say this, but I don't you mom cares about ya.  You better talk to a family doctor and tell them, them have a long talk with your mom to try and settle this thing out.|`|b6EyFLgUaa	Having children young is not an excuse for being a bad parent. I think you should talk to your mom about how you feel and if she doesn't listen, talk to her friends. Tell them this is your house too and you don't want them here. Your mom needs to be a mother to her children and her friends aren't helping. I know your just a kid yourself but act like an adult and kick them out. It wont be easy but its what needs to be done for your family. It sounds like shes going through some midlife crisis. She needs a good talking to and told that shes being a bad mother. Dont be gentle with your words. Tell her how you feel.|`|qdFrJ21waa	My mom went though a phase like this when I was in high school and both my Dad and I were angry and resented her for it. But I think the reason was that she had me so young (your mom had kids young too) and so she missed out on being young and having fun, so she was sort of making up for it. After a couple of years it dies down and when I was about half way through college my relationship with her improved so much and now it's great. At this point there's not much you can do, you can tell her how you feel...but she might just need to 'grow' out of it herself. I bet things will get better, at least they did for me.|`|A31yY0Qwaa	Try talking to her about it. Make her go to friday lunch with your dad, and if she makes other plans, try cutting the phone and saying sorry, so that she knows you are not doing it to piss her off.<br>  Thanks
2zC1lpfVaa	It may be early pregnancy symptom, but also it may be all the stress you have been through.  Probably you still miss your old place.<br>  <br>  Just slow down, and try to relax.
Y8ZmuWwgaa	You have some lovely names! I love Charlotte, Amelie, Annabelle, Isabelle, and Tessa especially.<br>  <br>  From your combinations, my favorite is Amelie Charlotte, followed by Tessa Rose. Amelie Charlotte has a lovely flow and both names are very sweet. I love both Tess and Tessa -- Tessa Rose sounds great!<br>  <br>  If it's okay to play with the combinations a little, I love Annabelle Madeline, Annabelle May, or Annabelle Margaret. While Madison is nice, it doesn't seem to flow as well or match Annabelle. <br>  <br>  While Ella is cute, I'd suggest using a longer form as well, to provide options later in life. Ella could be considered a little childish sounding later in life, so it's nice to have a formal form to fall back on. Elizabeth, Eleanor, Elena, Elisa, Elodie, Elsa, Isabella, Arabella, Gabriella, and Michaela are some great names that could shorten to Ella. There definitely ones to consider! Louise will pair nicely with any of them.<br>  <br>  I'd also suggest considering using a longer of recognized form of Evie. Have you thought about using Eve, Eva, Evelyn, or Evangeline with Evie as a nickname? I have similar Evangeline Laila on my own list.<br>  <br>  I'd recommend the same thing for Elsie as well, although it does stand alone. Have you thought about Elsa or Elise? Also, you may want to think about the spelling Mai. It looks Asian, which gives the combination a smushed-up feel, as Elsie doesn't flow well. May looks much better, as it retains the simple and sweet feel. <br>  <br>  The only combination I don't care for at all is Sienna Alexis. They look pretty on their own, but both are very trendy right now. Most -Alex names are overused right now and feel very tired. Alexis especially is very dated to the '80s and it looks worn out. Sienna is pretty sounding, but it's extremely trendy, and I'm afraid it'll sound dated soon. I think this combination is one to avoid for now!|`|cn2rvsdOaa	Annabelle Madison<br>  Ella Louise<br>  Isabelle Lola<br>  Sienna Alexis|`|T0RIO33oaa	If i was the girl i would like Ella Louise, because i love my name and its Ellie Louise xx|`|gu1sEQN8aa	I seriously have a hard time choosing just one I love them all.

Madison is cute. :)<br>  <br>  Ella Louise is classy and cute<br>  <br>  Evie Lila.  I love both names, but not really together.  Try Evie Madison and Lila Isabelle<br>  <br>  Elsie Mai.  It's a little too "Farmgirl" for me.<br>  <br>  Tessa Rose is GORGEOUS!  10/10<br>  <br>  Sienna Alexis seem too similar to me for some reason.  Try Sienna Rose and Alexis Mykel<br>  <br>  Isabelle Lola.  I love Isabelle, but don't love Lola.  Try Isabelle Paige.<br>  <br>  Good luck and REALLY cute name choices!!!!!|`|IOQshyGMaa	AMELIE - I'm half french so I LOVE this name; CHARLOTTE - A pretty classic!<br>  <br>  ANNABELLE - Pretty!

c73QkZ2haa	The first sonogram would usualy show it and your pregnancy hormones are usually off the charts when they do your preg test. <br>  <br>  When i went for my first ultrasound at 12 weeks as soon as they put the thingie on my stomach you could see two sacs and i was like no way and the tech was like o ya!<br>  <br>  If you have identical twins in your family this is not inherited this is a fluke and a miracle. Faternal are inherited due to a condition called hyperovulation so if u have fraternal you have a chance. <br>  <br>  They would also be able to see 2 seperate hearts beating on the scan.|`|XOtHsTo0aa	We saw both sacs at 5 1/2 weeks.|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	the first sonogram shows all the babies most of the time.  :)|`|UkQuMykiaa	I found out at around 4 weeks.  I had a trans-vaginal ultrasound in the ER and they saw two fluid filled sacs.  The next time both were seen was when I for my sonogram at about 8 weeks.  I have heard of on hiding and being hard to see though.|`|Ka52nbhNaa	We found out at an ultrasound done at 6 1/2 weeks - clear as can be - two sacs.  Being considered high-risk, we had frequent ultrasounds after that and they never hid behind each ohter.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|wCRC0poAaa	at my 10 week scan.<br>  btw, with twins it is usual to measure at least 4 weeks ahead of dates.<br>  good luck!!|`|tRhI8sTNaa	i was a twin and they couldn't see me until my moms 3 ultra sound.
8Rn2pX4jaa	I had this problem all through the first 2 trimester's of this pregnancy.  I don't know why... but EVERYTHING made me gag or feel nausea.  But you have to have lots of liquid.  I finally found that I could drink super cold water with a twist of lemon.  <br>  <br>  You will have to find something that you can drink.  You need the fluid.  Your doctor may suggest you try electrolytes or something similar to get you hydrated.<br>  <br>  I would call your doc if you continue to feel this way.  Your feet will swell the rest of your pregnancy.  I am 40 weeks and I look like I have elephant feet!|`|PfLg9B6aaa	I had to go to the er last night cause I had drank hardly anything or ate and had to have an iv.  I was way more dehydrated then we thought.|`|4yUjAaadaa	you need to drink asap. i am eight months and ended up in the hospital at six months due to dehydration. it was an awful experience. was having contractions, seeing spots, and ended up being pumped full of 3 iv bags before they would let me get up from the bed. if you don't stay hydrated, you could easily go into preterm labor and your baby would not be near ready to come yet. very dangerous.|`|250f92c71f87d8b92c484cedce92e86eaa	Your feet tend to swell if you are on them to much but if you are worried about it go see your doctor even if it's only for piece of mind.As for drinking my wife went through a stage during pregnancy when she hardly drank anything but as i said before consult your doc just to be sure for yourself.<br>  Good luck with your birth.Hope it goes really well  :-)|`|AA10233637	yes, you should be drinking more
5ZmwpI5Qaa	Yes, I have heard of it but I think it is complete nonsense.<br>  <br>  Even if it did work there are many other, more effective, treatments for acid reflux that don't have as high of risks to your health.<br>  <br>  A chiropractor cannot fix your condition or any other. At best, they would just make your muscles feel better. It would be best to first see your doctor or an orthopedic specialist. I would advise that your do everything you can to avoid chiropractic treatment, as it will often do more harm than good.<br>  <br>  Chiropractors have to believe that everything causes conditions that only they can fix so they can convince patients that we can't live comfortably without visits twice per week.<br>  <br>  I had a stroke last year as a result of chiropractic treatment and have since made it a priority to raise awareness of the dangers of chiropractic care. I ask that anyone going to visit a chiropractor to be aware of the risks and make an informed decision about treatment.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	I have heard of it, and personally I think its a crock.  Theres no way in hell I am going to let some chiropractor mess with my sons tender bones and joints.<br>  <br>  lol.... kortni-  you have one of those friends too.... I do as well.... and she kept nagging me to go get my son adjusted after his birth..... I never did though..... my god.... she acts like the chirocpractor is a god or something.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	yeah, my child birth educator took her child to one & it worked.<br>  <br>  i took my baby to one because she couldn't turn her head to the right & her pediatrician wouldn't do anything about it. THANK GOD i went!! it was a lifesaver! since going she has full range of motion. i could put her on her tummy (which she'd scream bloody murder about before) and she started sleeping better & just seems to be in a better mood! i bet her neck was really bothering her.<br>  <br>  oh, and btw, what they do is apply slight pressure with a finger or an actuator (i think they're called)--which feels like a light tap, they did it on me first. they don't crack or pop the baby's joints. my LO barely noticed it. it was the noise she noticed most. <br>  <br>  yeah, i'm "one of those wacky chiropractic supporters" as they helped my daughter feel better when no one else would even acknowledge she was in discomfort, and they've helped my back tremendously. i also support cranio sacral therapists as one helped my daughter's head round out without the SKULL surgery suggested by the pediatrician. (cranio sacral work is an offshoot of chiropractic work, and they do work on kids with colic & ear infections to great success)<br>  <br>  god forbid someone goes outside of mainstream medicine to try & get better & avoid taking meds & having side effects. **rolls eyes**|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Yes.  I hear it works.  I have also heard that some chiropractors do adjustments on babies for colic and ear infections.<br>  <br>  I have never been to a chiropractor and I don't believe I would ever take my child.  But you asked if I had heard of it and i have.  I have heard it works too.  Just sayin.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	nope my baby went and got an ultrasound. Then her pediatrician put her on meds.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	Personally no I have not heard of that|`|xFK4Ajroaa	yes.  i actually have a friend who seems to refer us to the chiropractor for everything.  fortunately i didn't listen when she told me to go for something because her "diagnosis" was wrong in the first place!  look out for those wacky chiropractic supporters!<br>  <br>  :)<br>  <br>  really, you could go for a consultation just to see what they say..

It means beautiful girl in my culture.|`|LQqTQYYZaa	I love the meaning of the name but I personally don't like it because it sounds like obese which means fatty in english(our culture)|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	Beautiful. And may I suggest Crappants for a boy? It means "warrior" in my culture.|`|AA10285288	Yes, I do. <br>  <br>  You can name her Obeice Fatassa.|`|AA11273571	Tubby-kins is kinder.|`|sGP6s7uraa	It's nice.  It should go with Fattifatti  Toobyfour
eS4CSdQ5aa	i say 50/50 chance <br>  <br>  because my son has a heart rate of 145 - 166 range and like i said he's a boy<br>  <br>  no morning sickness<br>  <br>  breakouts|`|GxlkhRfoaa	I am 18 weeks pregnant with a girl.  Her heart rate has always been between 140 and 165.  I was horribly sick for the first several weeks.  I haven't had any different skin issued though.|`|EZcBe3C8aa	I am 26 weeks pregnant with a girl. Her heart rate is always around 153. I didn't have hardly any morning sickness with her. With my first pregnancy i had a lot of morning sickness and i had a boy. Old wives tales is a myth. you can't go by that. you will only know for sure when you see your beautiful baby on the ultrasound. good luck.|`|AA11661793	Girl. I was so sick the first 4 months with my daughter, my skin broke out it was pretty bad. This time around I am like your first pregnancy with your son I feel great, no sickness, not broken out. We are hoping for a boy, but as long as he or she is healthy thats all that matter. We will find out in a couple weeks!|`|dq9uclgpaa	I think it's a girl. There an old myth thet when your pregnant with a boy you wont be sick but with a girl you will be.|`|KyGhcrzLaa	girl, because it is said that you become sick and vomit when its a girl|`|bTlhBX3daa	Honestly, those are all old wive's tales. I am pregnant with a boy, had extreme morning sickness (has come back in the 3rd Trimester), his heartrate has been anywhere from 142 to 168 bpm. <br>  <br>  I've heard that every pregnancy is different. I would go with your gut feeling, or just wait until your gender scan.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you and Congratulations.|`|yea2hci5aa	I read that the faster the heart beart is then it's most likely a boy.  But I wouldn't lean towards that.  Unfortunately the only way for you to find out is to wait till the ultrasound.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|8zODA3dIaa	i have two girls and didnt have morning sickness with either one of them...im going to assume if i ever get pregnant again that if i do get morning sickness it will be a boy|`|079d2408b404792068cec1c2e4eb8488aa	I would say from the heart beat a girl. I had morning sickness with both of mine. My first was a girl and I am now 23 weeks with a boy. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|IUuUoiZhaa	well 4 boys the heart rates r normally in the 150's at the highest and girls can go higher then that they start low then strt rising im no doctor but i think it's a girl!!|`|R1eten5Haa	Sounds like a girl to me. :-) With my girls, heart rates were higher and I had horrible MS.
OlEnfCo3aa	blaralynn|`|VHHis05Naa	Yikes, none of them.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I can not answer that they are all  H O R R I D|`|HvoOeTVuaa	If I had to choose one, it would be Blairette.  I think that you should just use the name Blair.  There is nothing wrong with it in my opinion.  I can definitely see Blair as a successful adult.|`|udVdQSchaa	Why don't you just call her Blair? <br>  <br>  Blair sound FAR better than any one of the names you've suggested.|`|Z81bOxq7aa	I agree with grammy, is this some other language??<br>  JTM&AB|`|Uj1QQejQaa	Do they have to start with "bl" ..?|`|lbThMxj7aa	Blaralynn or Blarina|`|Xw37uAkWaa	Blarelle or Blarina, seem to flow better than the rest.  They are all quite different though.|`|tjLwhmmsaa	Blarina it sounds more normal|`|AA11186650	hmm their all awkward, but i think maybe instead of Blaralynn..maybe Blairlynn|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Aww damn , I might just be retarded but i can't say a single one of those .... And i'm 25 :(|`|T1R6UZDOaa	I would have to choose Blarelle|`|0667spwIaa	god wow thats tough... all of them are ridiculous. i guess blairette or blarelle?
bWzTzrUtaa	I'm pregnant with twins and mine started popping out at around 5 months.|`|ABwnRvfAaa	Everyone is different.  It can happen at any time or not at all.  I never carried twins but with my babies, my belly button never popped out, it just sort of flattened.  (So sad.  I miss my cute little innie.)|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Every pregnancy is different. Some women it never pops out. I had an 'outie' since birth. Mine really poped out there around 13 weeks, but like I said it was already out somewhat. Im pregnant with 1. I'm not sure if twins makes a difference with belly buttons or not.
52bAHCaUaa	Yep.<br>  <br>  A baby will not get everything from their parents. You have to consider grandparents, aunts, uncles, ect.<br>  <br>  The ONLY way to know that a baby is really theirs(if you are having doubts I mean) is with a DNA test.|`|qayCggxMaa	Absolutely.  Blue eyes is a recessive gene, meaning both parents could have brown eyes but still carry the gene for blue eyes and pass it on to their children.  My mother has brown eyes and my dad has hazel eyes, but 3 out of 4 of us kids had blue eyes.  Genetics is a funny thing.|`|wphLaVs6aa	Yes. Each person has two genes for eye color. Brown is a dominant gene and blue is recessive. If you and your partner both have brown eyes, but both have a parent (so your child's grandparents) with blue eyes, you each have a blue recessive gene. As parents, each of you passed one gene for eye color onto your baby. It's therefore possible that both brown-eyed parents gave the baby one recessive blue gene each.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	It sure is. To of my friends both with brown eyes have a two yo w/ blue eyes. And he looks EXACTLY like his father-there is NO question what so ever!|`|IngripgMaa	Yes, Most Def.  You have to take into account for other family members genes as well!|`|heCuvfPSaa	Yes!|`|jIsAIwCgaa	its actually very common for new babies to have blue eyes, they say that they can change within the first 6mo, but if they dont then they probably wont, but so my mom and her ex both had hazel eyes and my half bro has the bluest eyes you will ever see. children can also inherit traits from grandparents, aunts and uncles too...|`|TJusfEnlaa	I would have to say YES definately because my partner has very blue eyes, yet both his parents have hazel/brown eyes. Apparently his grandfather who he never met had blue eyes. If there is someone in your immediate family with blue eyes, i would say yes, there is a small chance..|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	yes it is possible  first how old is the child, cause babys sometimes are born with blue eyes when they are born and with in a year they change  my husband has hazel eyes i have brown and when my daughter was born she had blue, and shes 3 now and has brown|`|ValLVBcYaa	The majority of babies actually start out with blue eyes and they change as they get older.<br>  <br>  But yeah, it's possible anyway. It depends on how dominant the parents genes are.|`|LiUvP42qaa	Yup, someone, somewhere in the blood lines must have blue eyes.  My husband has brown and I have green.  Our daughter has gray and our son blue.|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	Absolutely!! My husband and I both have dark brown eyes and my son has bright blue eyes!!<br>  <br>  Everyone carries the recessive gene for blue eyes. If those 2 genes match up you get blue eyes!!|`|nYioXmnGaa	Yep  you have to consider grand parents aunt and uncle and other relatives too .|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	yes. it happens, but it is rare.|`|xvNIw9xyaa	Yes. Parent's with brown or hazel eyes have a dominant gene showing. If they are BOTH carrying a recessive gene for blue eyes, then the baby could get both recessive genes passed down to him and have blue eyes. If he gets even just one dominant gene for brown eyes though, he will have brown eyes, because the dominant gene will hide the recessive one, even if he does have one recessive gene for blue eyes.|`|ccK75CR5aa	If the 2 parent's have a brown/hazel eyes then the baby had blue eyes something that in situation is not right because, One of those parent's have been mess with somebody behind somebody back.|`|tRhI8sTNaa	if it's a newborn the baby has blue eyes anyway. And yes if someone on either side of the family has brown or hazel eyes then yes it is possible simple biology.|`|eAhPup5baa	yes most definetly...<br>  <br>  <br>  dont worry this is genetic<br>  <br>  <br>  most likely the blue eyes came from a previous family member...<br>  <br>  this rarely happens.
Drnpe4T5aa	When you have a cold, your body's natural way of getting rid of the virus is to "wash it out" - which is why your nose runs.  <br>  Your body will also try to mount an attack against the virus by raising it's temp.  The theory is that your body can function a few degrees above normal, but the viruses can't.  <br>  The best thing to get over a cold quickly is to let your body do what it was meant to do when sick.  ;)  Unless your fever is making you uncomfortable, try to get by without fever reducers.  Try to limit nasal decongestants to nighttime use only.<br>  Aside from these recommendations, get some good rest!  Do these things and you'll be feeling better by Mon.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	sit down with a litre of water and sip it slowly.<br>  <br>  aim to sip 3L of water over the course of the day (not all at once!)<br>  <br>  sleep as much as you can. <br>  when not sleeping, rest quietly and close your eyes.<br>  <br>  lay a wet washer over your eyes to help reduce irritation and any internal swelling.<br>  <br>  have a shower before sleeping, the steam will help clear that <br>  congestion<br>  <br>  good luck with your new job :)|`|5IPZ7w2caa	For starters stop drinking orange juice.   <br>  <br>  ..|`|r9GXHd5Baa	Drink a hot toddy.  You may have these items around the house.  Jack Daniels, peppermint, and some lemons.  Mix and heat up all together. Drink and stay in the bed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|8Oh1UUqvaa	I hope you have a humidifier cause it worked wonders on me. Get lots of rest and eat lots of homemade chicken soup. Hope you feel better soon!
BzvstX7uaa	I will answer your question appropriately instead of pretending I am the perfect mother and you are CRAP. I can't stand that. Parents who think "parenting" is simple and should be done perfectly, with the result being that your child is some perfect little robot who makes no mistakes and obeys every command you make without you having to say it twice. Life ain't the Brady Bunch. That's just not how it works. I don't believe half the crap some of the "perfect moms" say on here. =) And I'm not saying every person who posted here IS that person, I'm mostly talking about on other questions too. The really NASTY moms. <br>  <br>  You are a wonderful mother. <br>  <br>  <br>  My faults as a single mom lately?? Here ya go. <br>  I yell too much<br>  I am on the computer too much, at times<br>  I do not keep up with laundry, I let it get out of hand<br>  I let him watch too much TV sometimes....<br>  Sometimes I get lazy about dinner.|`|ux6j2OIeaa	Ha, ha!!!   I have 3 boys and you sound so much like me, lol!  I know that sometimes i might not be doing what some people would say is the "right way to parent"  but i know that i'm a great Mum.  Also people are always saying how well behaved and well mannered my kids are so i can't be doing too much wrong.|`|7jXChfBNaa	i think it sounds to me like you are doing a great job...and you know what if you are giving in and maybe spoiling him a little bit well my philosophy is that just shows how much you love him, that is the same struggles i have with my 17 month old daughter. i give in way too much and end up giving her way, it is usually when it comes to us being in a store and her wanting out of the cart/stroller to walk around. but anyways keep your head up and who gives a **** what other people say. your doing fine=}|`|qSWrOeLDaa	I'm not up to your stage yet, but you sound like a pretty good parent - no, you're not perfect, but nobody else is either. According to psychologist, mothers don't have to be perfect to have healthy, normal children - "good enough" really is good enough!<br>  <br>  My baby is only two months old, but sometimes if he's due for a feeding and I haven't eaten anything myself, I'll let him wait 5 or 10 minutes until I've had something to eat, because I know that once I start feeding him, I won't be able to eat for a good half hour to an hour. I actually got annoyed at him today for crying so much. He's cute, but parenting isn't easy, and I know it only gets harder from here on. :)<br>  <br>  I still believe that a mother has to take care of herself so that she should be able to take care of her children. If she's hungry, tired, or cranky, etc. how can she be warm and loving to her children?<br>  <br>  Watch your TV, let him amuse himself... you're definitely a good enough mother if those are your struggles.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	I like how everybody has just critiqued what you said rather than just answering your question. :P<br>  <br>  I don't actually have any kids yet, I just babysit and have mediocre parents myself and that's where I get my answers from, so I don't really have an answer here.  But I don't think you're doing anything wrong.  Nobody is perfect, I doubt anybody is consistent with discipline 100% percent of the time, everybody has that favorite tv show-- a 5 year old can entertain himself for an hour, and everybody's temper has its limits.  As long as you're paying attention to when you cross the line, you're doing a great job. :0|`|rhPCJfeuaa	Goodness, don't people actually read a question anymore?  She's not asking for you to critique her parenting skills or techniques.  She's simply asking you to state your weaknesses and what you feel you can improve upon in your own life.  Sheesh!!<br>  <br>  I also could use more patience at times.  I have a 5.5 yr old, myself, who tries to push my buttons at every opportunity.  And a 2 yr old.  Sometimes, I just have to remind myself that it's not always about manipulation, but rather them wanting a snuggle, kind word, or kiss.  Just one more that they feel they need for whatever reason.  I find I yell less and use my brain more when I take my emotions out of the equation.  I try to remember what I was like as a teacher instead of a mother.  When I kiss them and hug them, the anger can't help but melt away or thaw a bit.  Esp when I see the love in their eyes.  I just remind myself how precious they are and how short a time they have actually been on this Earth.  They are very well behaved, so I must be doing something right.  Even when I know I am doing wrong when I sometimes give in due to pure exhaustion and frustration.
E5CnUdhsaa	well in all honesty i would of said in a calm voice well im her mother of course im going to be here....who are you again....oh thats right the woman that even with a ring on her finger will not and never have any responsibililty over my daughter because you are not and bever will be her mother. then i would gently take my daughters hand and say come on sweetie lets leave this silly girl to have a tantrum and explain why shouting at your peers is unnacceptable.......also in front of everyone.<br>  <br>  <br>  this is of course after ive taken a deep breathe and and avoided throttling the whining hag lol|`|2LDGlA1Paa	Please remember now and for always ... the number one rule is: What's in the best interest of the child.  The second rule is: Never bad-mouth the other parent (or their current partner)<br>  <br>  There will come a day when your daughter is old enough to make up her own mind about what she has observed and heard over the years.  Not that following the two rules above will be easy (because LOTS of times it won't be) but in the long run, you will be grateful for having followed the moral high-ground and set the example of what good behavior is.  Your long term relationship with your daughter and having her be a young woman that makes you proud will be your reward.<br>  <br>  As for this current episode, I concur pretty much with what Chris said.|`|haabfMtkaa	I think no matter what this is a hard situation. If her Dad took this on then let him handle it. Let it be there thing. If there is a show or something then of course your there. Maybe you should take turns at the practice. I think any activate is a great thing but conflict especially in front of your daughter is not so good. I would express to your ex that when it comes to your daughter you would like it better if he handle things with you that next time (if there is a next time) you will let his girl friend know that as well (in private of course witch she might not like to much). Ive been on both sides and in my opinion she needs to stay out of it unless she is looking for conflict. But I do not see anything wrong with gymnastics being there thing, plus you can get some you time.|`|ibeYAlwpaa	I have a bad temper so i probably would have defyt said something esp. to the gf. What did the father say when his gf spoke up? Anything? Bc she was soo out of line. You were invited…. And its something your daughter participated in so you were defly more then welcome there. I think you did more then enough convincing your daughter to allow her dad to participate. && to be honest you probably took the best route by NOT saying anything right then and there, but you should defly say something about it now. Like how completely inappropriate it was and how embarrassing, for not only you but your daughter your as well. && as for her fathers hissy fit you should also tell him that he should be looking out for the best interest of his child and his child was more comfortable with you participating and next time he should try and pretend to be a grown up and cry about later.<br>  <br>  <br>  ooo and that comment above me is reallly funny!!!|`|MvC6n3DWaa	Wow--I think you ex and his girlfriend need to evaluate the objective. Was it to have fun or make some kind of statement? <br>  <br>  I would not get into a debate at the school in front of your daughter. I would have left your daughter with the teacher, asked your ex and his friend to step out. I would have then calmly told them that as her mother, you have the right to attend the class and a good parent does just that. Remind them, that you would never intrude on their private time with your daughter, show up at their house or at some other engagement. But this is different. Let them know that once she is comfortable with this new activity, you will be happy to take turns so that each parent can enjoy it with their daughter. Remember, he is also a parent.<br>  <br>  He may have thought that this was going to be their 'thing'. A bonding activity. His girlfriend may have thought it was their time to act like a little family......I know, you don't like that, but she probably had some type of expectation. Acknowledge it and you will be suprised at how much mileage you get. A simple "I understand that it may seem like I am intruding and that is not my intention. As her mother, I am concerned about our 4 year old and also excited about the activity. She is not rejecting you, but doing what 4 year olds do, and that is cling to mom".<br>  <br>  I do not think he should have reacted that way or she should have said ANYTHING. But it is what it is and you will have to learn how to deal with it productively so that your daughter does not pay the price.<br>  <br>  BTW-as tempting as it is to be clever in a retort, it only makes matters worse.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	Emma's mom said every thing better than I would have. <br>  Mine would have included violence that was totally inappropriate.<br>  You were great!
397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	wow, you are lucky, you got a sleeper!! My baby is 14 months and still wakes up a few times a night to nurse!!  If she has gained back her birth weight and your supply is pretty good, I wouldnt wake her, jsut let her decide when to eat. At that age, Olivia would go anywhere between 30 minutes to 5 hours in between feedings.|`|yCwPxulYaa	I always woke my baby to feed her during the day so that she would go the longer strecthes at night.  <br>  <br>  My doctor told me that babies don't wake up because they are hungry....they wake up and realize they are hungry. (her opinion that I dont know is true or not).<br>  <br>  I would say that if I was you, I would not let her go more then 3 hours during the day since she is only 3 weeks old.<br>  <br>  But, if she is gaining well and sleeping longer strecthes at night, let her sleep.|`|844afb426cc1a9cf5ec93ffd1311e2ebaa	No, let her sleep. As long as shes wetting her diapers and gaining weight there is no reason to wake a sleeping baby. They need to learn to distinguish the hunger feeling.|`|AA11920812	It really depends on you. What works best for you. With my first I followed that logic - don`t wake a sleeping baby. However, I did notice my milk supply did drop a bit. And, with the irregular feedings I tended to get engorged more often (because he`d eat like a pig, then go for HOURS without eating).<br>  <br>  With my second I scheduled him more. And, did wake him every three to four hours to eat. Even if that meant stripping him down to his diaper.<br>  <br>  I did breastfeed my oldest for a longer period of time (9 months, 2 of those while pregnant with my second). But, although my youngest was breast feed for a shorter period of time he was almost exclusively breastfed. While my first had more formula and bottles...probably because I was overwhelmed with the breastfeeding. <br>  <br>  For my next baby I will definately schedule. It just made it easier for me. After awhile he got used to the schedule and followed the routine on his own. And, my body got used to breastfeeding at those intervals. I think it just depends on your personality. I really like the dependability of the schedule - especially with two toddlers (2 and 3) to chase around while breast feeding this time.<br>  <br>  If you have the time and energy to let her at her own schedule that is fine as well. Or, if you just don`t like waking her that`s fine as well. Just watch your supply, and if you notice a dip than you can change the schedule to suit you both.<br>  <br>  Good Luck! And kudos to you for keeping with it, breastfeeding isn`t easy at this stage. But, once she gets a little older it will be MUCH MUCH easier for you both!|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	If your baby has gained back their birthweight ,are doing good with gaining weight in general..and if your supply is pretty steady..than me personally..I would say stop waking her at night.<br>  <br>  The reason they tell you to wake them after 4 hours is to get your supply going, and to make sure they gain enough weight.<br>  <br>  At this point, as long as her weight is good..just let her nurse whenever she wants..dont watch the clock..and if she nurses..try to keep her awake..but if not dont worry if she falls asleep.<br>  In the beginning weeks my daughter nursed for maybe 3-5 minutes at a time.|`|yxeRpHDUaa	I think they recommend no more than 4 hour between feeds because if your baby doesn't feed enough they then don't have the strength to feed next time they wake up and they get weaker. But this is for brand new newborns and I don't know if it's the same at 3 weeks. <br>  <br>  Personally I think you let her sleep when she's tired and eat when she's hungry and don't worry about everything else. I went nuts with my son worrying that he was eating too much as it seemed like he was hungry all the time, more than every 2 hours - now he's completely settled down and I wish I'd ignored all the advice and gone with my gut instinct.|`|nQyJFOMZaa	My Pediatrician told me and I quote "never wake a sleeping baby" they know when they are hungry. Waking her up may start a bad sleeping habit for her GOOD LUCK!!|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Well it depends on your supply really.  Do you feel really full before she is ready to eat?? If you do then it sounds like you have a good supply.  If you don't then I would wake her after four hours...but I wouldn't wake her at night.   <br>  <br>  If she is 3 weeks then she might be gearing up for a growth spurt and you will be nursing around the clock.  If you have just gone through that then she is doing what most babies do at that age and sleeping longer stretches.  Growth spurts come about every 3 weeks for the first 3 months.  Then they come about every 3 months.<br>  <br>  Nurse on demand.  That is your best bet.  She has her whole life for schedules!!|`|dI664zW0aa	ok i see you have a lot of answers already but i thought I would share my expertise with you anyway :) <br>  <br>  A breastfed baby at 3 weeks should be nursing about 8 to 10 times in a 24 hour but that may vary with each child.<br>  <br>  As long as she is haveing at least 6-8 wet cloth diapers or 4-6 wet disposable diapers and gaining well she is getting enough to eat.<br>  <br>  sometimes babies that sleep longer stretches at night have a session of cluster feeding where they nurse every hour for 2-4 hours and it sounds like that is what your little one is doing.<br>  <br>  I think she would do just fine sleeping 5 to 6 hour stretches twice during 24 hours.<br>  <br>  I hope this helped and good luck and congrats on the breastfeeding and the baby :)
BRT2teSqaa	No.  She shouldn't have to leave.  She paid money to see the movie, why would you expect her to leave in the middle of it?  The other girl should have walked out and called her mother to explain.|`|DaS9fwakaa	You dropped your daughter off for a movie but didn't know what time it was supposed to end? <br>  <br>  Your daughter should have just gotten on the phone - they really are everywhere, called and let you know the situation. Or she should have explained the situation when she got home the 15 or 20 minutes late that the movie would have taken. <br>  <br>  Something is wrong with this scenario - sounds like something out of the 50's...|`|rBq189W1aa	I think I'd be flexible enough to accept that my daughter was going to be home a bit later than we'd initially agreed upon. I wouldn't expect her to leave before the movie was over just for the sake of sticking to some arbitrarily decided time, and I certainly wouldn't be self-centered enough to expect her friend to do so.|`|45nSn7Rcaa	I would have expected my daughter to go out to the lobby and call home and tell me they were wrong about the time the movie ended and is it alright if I stay for the end?  I would have said yes...if she didn't do that I would have given her ****t for not calling and making me worry.  The other girl had a right to want to watch the movie she paid to see a;nd she should have stepped out and callled her mom too.|`|suWnr83laa	The point of going to the movies is to see it. I think they are entitled to do so. If you were concerned about your daughter being picked up at an exact time you should have checked the running time of the movie beforehand and allowed 20 mins on top of that for previews and time to get out.|`|x0VOoEagaa	i would have called my mom and explained the situation. i dont think the mom would be mad. it happens. i would have felt a little irritated that the friend doesnt have more respect that that, and i would have been angry a little. but you also paid $8. im sure a simple call would do.<br>  or if the mom was VERY anti you being out past that time, i would have asked her to come pick me up.|`|idn1OQucaa	I would understand that movies are over when they're over, and I would not have expected my child to be home at x time if the movie got out later.  <br>  <br>  In the future I'd try to get a better idea of when a movie would be getting out before expecting my child to be home at x time.  If there was some crucial reason she needed to home at x time, and I knew the movie would not let out in time - then I'd tell her she'd have to make the movie on another day.<br>  <br>  No, I wouldn't be angry.   The other girl probably knew her mother was coming a x time, and she probably didn't want to call and say, "can you come get us now because so-and-so has to be home, even though we paid to see the movie; and thought we would get to see the whole thing."<br>  <br>  I kind of feel bad for the other girl that was put in such a position; and maybe she will decide to go to the movies with other friends in the future.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Wow. $8 for a movie? That's awesome. It's $12.50 here, and even the matinee is $9.50. <br>  <br>  Ok, off point I know, but...... I had to address my jealousy of the cheap movie ticket first. <br>  <br>  I'm not a parent, but I've been in that scenario before, and I've just sent a quick text explaining and everything has been okay. Usually my parents are pretty flexible about things like that. I don't think it's healthy to be super-rigid. : )
D9ufwiMXaa	LOL everything makes me feel like I have to pee! But  yes more so when I'm have BHC than any other time.<br>  30wks3 days with #1...its a boy!|`|yea2hci5aa	I did and it's because your uterus keeps contracting and it puts pressure on your bladder.<br>  <br>  You'll get through it.|`|R1eten5Haa	Yes. the baby pushing down with the BHC causes pressure on the bladder. :-)|`|04fd2039534f9759f9ec4ae1101ff131aa	I did too but then again any little movement made me have a strong urge to pee.|`|uuHPneEcaa	I didn't. every pregnant woman is different.<br>  <br>  I have urges to pee when ever he moves thats about it... and sometimes when I caugh

pFDu5I3Uaa	Honestly if they knew about it and truly knew I would be rather upset. That' kinda rude and childish. I love the name Aiden but would never use it because my friend had it picked for her baby boy.<br>  <br>  It's like an unspoken rule.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Well that all depends , Did you tell them the baby name and then they just used it , Then yes .<br>  <br>  <br>  If you both had the same baby name in mind then no because you both had the name .<br>  <br>  <br>  If you didn't tell anyone and they just used it then no because they didn't even no u  liked that name .|`|ddp73SCWaa	Yes, if you had clearly told them that you were going to use it. Although, if when you told the person you liked it and they also mentioned they liked the name as well I think it is fair game. I also think if depends on how old you are, when you are going to start to having kids, etc. If you are not going to be trying (e.g., you are in high school) for years yet, I think it's ok since you will most likely change your mind by then. If you are trying though, or soon to be, that's not nice.|`|AA11186650	Actually, my moms friend did that, My name was going to be Meygan and my moms friend named her daughter that so i got left with Morgan. And a girl i went to school with, is pregnant now. My daughters name is Jaidyn and my neices names is Gabrielle...This girl always complimented on our kid's names and now her daughters name will be Gabriella JayDan.<br>  I was pretty mad|`|b6005a2c7a6c9d1be0d749ed0a992fb3aa	It happened to my mom for my sister. She was pretty mad, but then she ended up naming my sis something else that she now thinks is much better. It all works out in the end! :)|`|e7uUfLsqaa	No.|`|vQ8XPXsdaa	Yes. Thats why I wouldn't tell them.|`|OlEnfCo3aa	yea|`|9YyzSkXWaa	I believe I would be at first.  If they did it behind my back, I would be upset because it was a name I liked and its kind of rude to do that to anyone you love / care about.  It would make sense for them to talk to you about it.<br>  <br>  I feel that I would get over it though and be fine with it in the end.  Life is too short to be angry at people and hold grudges and we are called to love others and not judge them.  :-)|`|Xw37uAkWaa	My sister has done this to me twice and I was so mad at her!  I said nothing this last time around with my new baby.  She would've probably taken her name too.|`|Elxuvon8aa	it happened to me and then they called her by her middle name|`|aqto0hJTaa	Yep.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Maybe i would, it really depends on the name (if it's really popular than no), if it's less popular (than maybe).  If it's a friend it would also depend on how good a friend they were and for a relative it would depend on how close i was to them and where they lived.  So lol i might get mad but i might not, it really would depend on the situation.|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Nope, I wouldn't ever do that because it's rude.  Unless of course they were certain they would not have anymore children and I asked them for approval beforehand.  Otherwise, no, it's mean to steal a friend or relatives baby name.  My cousin wanted to name her kid Alanna if a girl, but had a boy instead.  She is pregnant again.  If she has a girl she's naming her Alanna.  I love the name too, but didn't go naming my girl that, because she (my cousin) would have been so offended!|`|AA11920812	Yes.<br>  <br>  In fact, I named my first after my grandpa. My sister has said she wanted to use my grandpa`s middle name for her *son* if she gets pregnant again...and if its a boy. I`m just like, okay...I`ve done that already...|`|xrJqmRFqaa	No.  No one owns the rights to a name, and especially if you aren't pregnant, you have no right to complain.
AA11250679	You can still give birth to a child of ectopic pregnancy; however, the health risk is high for both mother and child.  <br>  <br>  The ectopic pregnancy must be removed from the tube; or whichever section of the body the pregnancy is stuck in.|`|R1eten5Haa	Usually, it results in miscarriage when the fallopian tube ruptures and can cause internal bleeding. God is all powerful though, and the Author of miracles! I will be praying. His plan is best no matter what.|`|sg9ET4vkaa	I was under the impression you can't give birth to it. It's stuck in a place where it can't grow correctly and becomes a deformed fatal blockage to a mother if not removed.|`|vue9NOhYaa	No, there is no way to carry an ectopic pregnancy to term, or move the embryo into the uterus.<br>  <br>  Sorry.|`|ROJans2Taa	very small chance, you risk rupture and death of mother and baby, ive heard of one case where a mother uknowingly went to 25 weeks and gave birth, but no doctor would allow it.|`|G4qP2gATaa	Ectopic pregnancies are terminated once they are discovered because they pose a great risk to the mother. <br>  <br>  However there have been cases where ectopic pregnancies have been carried to term. Those are the exception though, and not the rule.|`|ibWLdXlJaa	No they would terminate the pregnancy once they discovered it.|`|eU5Eth2aaa	Unfortunatly, no.  The baby would never survive and could cause death for the mother.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Not recommended it can kill the mother.|`|ybexjS2Paa	No! Ectopic means "out of place." In an ectopic pregnancy, a fertilized egg has implanted outside the uterus. The egg settles in the fallopian tubes in more than 95% of ectopic pregnancies. This is why ectopic pregnancies are commonly called "tubal pregnancies." The egg can also implant in the ovary, abdomen, or the cervix, so you may see these referred to as cervical or abdominal pregnancies.<br>  <br>  None of these areas has as much space or nurturing tissue as a uterus for a pregnancy to develop. As the fetus grows, it will eventually burst the organ that contains it. This can cause severe bleeding and endanger the mother's life. A classical ectopic pregnancy does not develop into a live birth.|`|0a35bd8efe64caf91fcf1e0cf5d79e07aa	No. Ectopic pregnancies need to be terminated unless you want to die from it. Did you know most anti-abortion propaganda include ectopic pregnancies in the numbers? Don't let anyone convince you differently, neither the word nor act of abortion is found anywhere in the Bible. If you are experiencing an ectopic pregnancy, God does not want you to die over this. Do not forget that Luke was a physician, follow your doctor's recommendation. God bless.|`|AA11116434	There was an article in the news last year about a woman who carried full term an ectopic pregnancy. It's very dangerous and usually if it gets that far the mom and baby don't survive. Luckily, the article was about a mom and baby that did survive. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.lifenews.com/int770.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.lifenews.com/int770.html</a>|`|Rx31LHjbaa	Extremely rarely babies have survived when it was an ectopic pregnancy.  These babies cannot be delivered vaginally because they aren't in the uterus, but rather in the abdominal cavity.|`|AA10832514	Very rarely.  It has happened, but is highly unusual.  Has to be cesearean, of course, if it is even a viable fetus.|`|CPPBqVaaaa	im hoping this helps u.. if not go talkin to a doctor..|`|3fEfuPWOaa	No.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	No. If you carry the child too long it can kill you.

caWdGcvgaa	around 6 months or so, I usually toasted it so it would be so mushy... less of a chance they will choke!<br>  <br>  Oh and wheat bread also tends not to be as mushy..so it is less of a hazard than white bread!|`|pXSKSS3daa	I started giving Noah bits when he started self feeding, this was at 7 months.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	well my son is 7 1/2 months and when we go out to eat we give him a chunk of the loaf to just munch on.

eH58ELw5aa	I think people can cut back without it affecting their kids classes if that's what the kids are into - it's probably better to let them carry on with the classes, particularly if they are some kind of enrichment classes like music, sport or art.<br>  <br>  We're still paying for guitar lessons for one of ours, but we might end up getting the bus to the class instead of a taxi over the next few months to save money.  We also sometimes go out for a burger after the class, so that will probably stop and I'll make the lunch at home instead.<br>  <br>  It seems easier for me to make those kinds of cut backs without having to get her to stop the class.|`|FiUprYsvaa	My brother is still playing hockey and he just got all new equipment.<br>  That's about the only thing he does. <br>  <br>  Oh and band at school cost a lot for him too and it still gets paid. <br>  <br>  I am 19 and live at home but I pay for my own soccer.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	well, my son is too busy at home with his 3 dogs, 3 snakes, 1 lizard, and pregnant mommy to notice any kind of cutbacks lol

I now weigh myself on my own scales so I can get an accurate reading.

n6XYYyoLaa	six oz four times a day is only 24 ounces; that sounds low even if she is eating solids; my gal drinks thirty two ounces and eats food; she get four 8 oz bottles a day with her food in between;  i am guessing she's hungry bc of that; and if you aren't feeding solids, her tummy is empty!! try upping her bottles to 8 oz and feed solids if you aren't , if you are maybe add in an extra meal or snack a hour or two before bedtime.....|`|pXSKSS3daa	You're not doing anything wrong from what I can see. Some babies just don't sleep through the night until they are older. I know that's not what you want to hear but what is normal for one(sleeping through at this age) may not be normal for another.<br>  <br>  Are you offering any solids with her bedtime bottle? If not I'd try that. It doesn't ALWAYS work but it may. Noah has 5 oz. of formula and a small bowl of applesauce. Can you push her 4 PM nap back any? Try it at 4:30.<br>  <br>  Also, is this a new thing or has she been doing it for awhile? Sometimes Noah goes through phases where he'll wake an hour-two hours after he's been put down. Then he'll be up for a couple of hours. It's really weird and I have NO explanation for it whatsoever but it only lasts a week or so at the most.<br>  <br>  You can certainly try offering more formula in her bottles. If she wakes shortly after being put down I'd also offer more at that time(if nothing else works).|`|AA10888290	my daughter goes through phases like this and I would not fight her. it gets better|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	my 14 month old doesnt sleep through the night. i dont think either of us are doing anything wrong. she probably will be waking at 3 still. my 8 year old step daughter wakes about once a week at night. she is just hungry, or she is just checking that you are still there. either way, i would give her a bottle.<br>  <br>  you could try giving her bigger bottles during the day, she might not drink them though|`|50lIaC8zaa	I know how you feel, my 9 month old still doesn't sleep through, she doesn't wake to eat but still wakes.<br>  <br>  Yeah you could try upping her milk during the day to see if that helps and also maybe shortening her morning nap a little, perhaps to just 1.5 hrs, it might not make any difference but its worth a try. <br>  <br>  Other than that if you've already got a bedtime routine then theres not really alot you can do, alot of babies don't sleep through for the first year or so but you are not doing anything wrong, nine times out of ten babies want a bottle in the night by this age just for comfort to get back to sleep. Hope this helps a little. x|`|EyKJ737daa	Ooops! Sorry it's a long answer, hope you have a cuppa with you to read it! :-/<br>  <br>  Sweetie you might find the day sleeps are now starting to interfere with the night sleep.  You can do one of two things. You can stick with the day sleeps but shorten them to no more than an hour each or you can give her one good sleep only of about 2-2.5hrs after her lunch.  The days sleeps you mentioned though are very long and that really is too much now and she is showing that by not sleeping at night.  You might also want to give her one final feed or a good snack before bed. Maybe give her a final bottle and then some custard or something before bedtime.  She really is only waking though out of habit now and knows that you will "crack" eventually and she'll get her wish.  Stubborn little things aren't they?! Mine was the same at the same age, believe me, drove me in sane for a couple of months before I ended up calling a helpline here in Australia.  They told me and I'll tell you sweetie (again I know) but you really do just have to let her cry at night.  Give her a drink of water only during the night.  Her bedroom door, do you close it when you put her to bed?  We had a sliding door on my (youngest) daughter's room and therefore I could hear a pin drop in her room.  When I visited my sister in another state for a 6 days stay with her, I put Juliette in the room which had a proper solid timber door and carpet.  This insulated her room really well, muffling her cry which did make it easier for me during the day to let her have a sleep (eventually as it was a new place she had to get use to) but she did go to sleep very well and I didn't stress so much because I couldn't hear her. Mum's are always so tuned into hearing their baby's every move, it's just an inbuilt sensor we have and it really sucks sometimes! But when I can home, hubby changed her door over to a solid door, don't have carpet but hey, can't have everything.  The timber door though worked really well in muffling her cries.  And got her to realize that mummy wont come to her every whim and call.  Is there anyway you are able to do something similar, mainly for your own sanity too.  Can you close your own bedroom door perhaps?  you really need to do something though sweetie because she is cracking you and she knows that if she persists, and time varies but she'll win.  And remember, you are not doing anything wrong.  Babies do not come with instruction manuals, it's all trial and error and you will get there.  If as a last resort sweetie, you really feel you need some sort of sleep and a catch up, then I really would suggest that you see your doctor for some sort of assistance.  I remember I did for my eldest when she was a baby.  She seriously didn't sleep at night, maybe 1/2 hr at a time with 1/2 awake then sleep again for another 1/2 hour.  Was really hard and we were very sleep deprived.  I saw my doctor and back then my daughter still wasn't diagnosed with WS so we thought it was normal for babies not to sleep at all! My doctor ended up prescribing some phenergan for my daughter but only like 2mls for 2 days at a time per week.  It did help her but other problems like severe reflux still woke her but it still gave hubby and I at least a few hours sleep before she woke screaming again.  You could see your doctor sweetie if all else fails and sometimes believe it or not, a few nights of this medication (under doctor's supervision) is actually enough to knock the habit out of them.  I wish I could help you more sweetie but I really don't know what else I can suggest apart from what I have already suggested previously on your calls for help.  Good luck sweetie and all the very best xx|`|EWaRenHLaa	It's not unusual for your daughter to be hungry or up at weird hours of the night. I remember my daughter didn't sleep through the night until she was 2 yrs old, even with only a 15 min nap in the afternoon ( I don't with that on anyone ). Try putting cereal in the milk and limiting the nap duration during the day.|`|ANNeg6Voaa	She is hungry. Are you giving her baby food yet feed her as much as she wants babies know when they are full. If she eats enough in the day she will not wake at night. Also try to keep her awake during the day make nap time a little earlier around 2:00 pm instead of four. Ask your babies doctor he will tell you the same.|`|Svgc3izpaa	It is Normal!    Both of my kids did the same thing.  They are growing!  And they are teething!  She is only 10mo  she is growing.

It is still normal for babies to be waking during the night at this age... but if she is hungry try giving her more milk and maybe introducing baby food if you aren't already!|`|3cxwalh0aa	You could try giving her more at each feeding... whatever she wakes up for in the middle of the night, try giving her that much during the day and see if that helps. My girls slept through the night at 3 months, but that only lasted for a month. Soon after they started waking up again, and it took us a couple of months to get back on track with a good feeding schedule so they'd be satisfied enough to sleep through the night.<br>  <br>  Also, how long is she awake during the day... what time does she wake up in the morning usually? You may have to get her up earlier, shorten her naps, something to get her to sleep for a several hour stretch. I had to cut out an evening nap to get my twins to sleep through the night. That, and I keep them a lot more active. Instead of letting them sit with their toys while I do a little housework, I engage them in a lot more activity so that they're always busy with something. It seems to wear them down well enough to the point that they can more easily sleep, and sleep well.<br>  <br>  Hope some of these help.|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	Yes it sounds like she is hungry and needs a bedtime routine.  With only a 6oz bottle is she eating any solid foods yet?  Babies have a high calorie need since they grow and develop so fast.  Best bedtime routine that worked for me was playtime active tumble and tickle on the floor time, then bathtime as long as they wanted to play in the tub was fine, then bottle as much as they wanted sometimes it was more than 8oz then bed.  Worked like a charm for me and it even has helped out a few friends with their babies.  Good luck...|`|a7pgX1W8aa	My son also is 10 monthes and he always get tired right around 7:00 pm, so I lay him down for a bit, then he gets back up at 8:30 pm. I give him his last bottle anywhere between 9:30 and 10:30 pm. I change his diaper and then he goes to bed. He whines for a little bit but then goes to sleep til morning. I also have lights and sounds machine that I play for him at bedtime that I think helps. <br>  <br>  I really think that your baby is telling you she needs more food. I think you should go up to 8 oz for her bottles. I would suggest the following:<br>  1. Give her 8 oz bottle in morning<br>  2. Around noon give he some baby cereal mixed with a fruit or formula, whatever you prefer, with 2 oz of juice or 6 oz formula to drink.<br>  3. At about dinner time give her 2 jars of baby food, one fruit and one vegeable and after give her a 6 oz bottle of formula. <br>  4. About an hour or so after her night time nap give her a 8 oz bottle of formula.<br>  <br>  Try putting her to bed around maybe 10:30pm, if that is not to late for you. If she whines just let her whine she will probably eventually go to sleep and maybe ever sleep through the night, as well as you being able to sleep. If the whining bothers you, then maybe try to get a sounds and lights machine like I did, it may help her, not to say she still won't whine some, but eventually she should go to sleep. Good Luck. I hope this helps. Take Care.
qC3r0Wa7aa	Wow...<br>  What horrible parents.<br>  <br>  Go to the police! :O|`|I6dcRgD6aa	it is illegal for the parent to do that.|`|88YAUVU4aa	Go to the police station or call them to pick you up and take you into a temp home. Is this real?|`|e5zOkZqIaa	Call the Police Immediately and tell them you have no home.  Parents have no right to do that no matter what you do.  If you misbehave and are causing problems they need to punish you with something like grounding or a spanking.<br>  <br>  Throwing your 12 year old boy out of the house is out of the line and is neglect.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	you would call the police and your parents would get in serious trouble. You are a minor and you are their responsibility until you turn 18. They are not allowed to kick you out this young!|`|AA10529334	Call child protective services -- look in phone book. They can help you get into a place to live and a place to be safe.|`|AA10888290	go to the police|`|imIe4gH5aa	He should stop acting like a little prick - that is obviously the reason he got kicked out in the first place.<br>  <br>  haha 4 thumbs down so far for that answer - and you all know it is  exactly the correct answer but won't admit it. IF it got to the point where the parents kicked him out it is obvious the kid needs to change if he wants to get back in the house.|`|sgcxvM3Jaa	go to your schools counselor they will intervene and they may set up a meeting  with the parents and the child. This had happen to me many years ago and that what I did.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Three letters....CPS
4iXL4C6paa	my first two were natural and my last two were induced and they all hurt like h*** lol but seriously alot of people say being induced hurts more but my personal experience my last two were less painful.|`|NysFTExhaa	I haven't had natural labor but with my boys I was induced with pitocin and they slowly upped the dosage over 12 hours so it was really slow and smooth for me.  I got the epidural about halfway in and didn't really feel any pain until my first son was on his way out.<br>  <br>  According to the nurses my labor was a lot easier than what they normally see though, I only had to push for about an hour total for both my boys.|`|xFK4Ajroaa	good question.  i 've wanted to know this too.  i had planned a natural delivery and ended up being induced and too begged for the epidural.  it was nuts.  congrats, mommy. :)
TEqxfG3Maa	I would wait to more day you may be stressed about something plus February is a short month! so the cycle may be off.|`|5yhamK5maa	I wouldnt worry much...try taking tylenol it helps.|`|IZoAmKmFaa	When I was on BC sometimes I would just skip my period.  My gyno told me to think of it as having a very light period.<br>  <br>  Not to scare you or anything but I recently found out I am pregnant and I was on BC and had been for 6 years.  I can tell you I suspected I was pregnant because I got period type cramps in the morning then they would disappear.  That and I became EXTREMELY fatigued, 12 hours of sleep wouldn't even be enough.<br>  <br>  But try not to worry, worrying can cause your period not to come.  If you miss it completely, take a test.  Good luck.|`|d6kekKgeaa	the longer you're on bc, the more likely it is that you can skip the occational period, it's normal. when i was on bc, i had the same thing happen, and my doc said that it was normal and not to worry. - though no bc is 100%, so give it a couple days and if for no other reasion then to reasure yourself, take a pee test.|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	bad period like cramps could be pregnancy.  The best thing to do is do a pregnancy test.  If it is negative and it doesn't start soon you need to figure out what is going on.|`|AA10254927	It cud be a delayed period.. sometimes impending periods cause those symptoms.<br>  If you are on the pill, chances that u r prego are rare... but then its not impossible.<br>  Wait a few days and run the urine test to be sure.<br>  GoodLuck
bTlhBX3daa	Every woman is different and so is every pregnancy. <br>  I haven't given birth yet but I read a lot about pregnancy, ask a lot of questions, and also took childbirth preparation classes. <br>  <br>  Some women's water will break and gush out, some leak a little at a time, sometime's the Dr's will actually break it, etc.|`|ZYlr9TSBaa	Mine broke suddenly in a big gush, but not over the midwife lol.|`|SCY0bOr5aa	I have 3 kids. My first two my water had to be broken. My last little one was C-Section.|`|98WKYtfwaa	Some peoples don't burst until the baby is on it's way out, which would lead to it squirting everywhere. Most peoples just sort of leak out, like your wetting yourself. <br>  <br>  Midwifes would be prepared for this if your water hasnt already broken.|`|Yn6pM2Xyaa	my doctor broke mine, no drama, just kinda oozed out, it was very warm and that surprised me.. after that they just give me a giant pad to wear and dispoable undies (lol) and I was stuck in the hospital.|`|VGoCh2C9aa	mine went slowly over time, i dont know anyone whose went dramatically but i know it can happen.|`|AA11661793	the doctor broke mine, it just leaked out.|`|YcwMK5Pbaa	I have given birth 3 times, and yes, that did happen to me once. <br>  <br>  When I was in labor with my youngest, I was sitting in a jacuzzi tub relaxing, at the hospital. When I got out I thought I had to pee. The second I sat down I felt the need to push. They rushed me to the deliver room, where the nurse had to basically deliver him because the dr didn't have enough time to wash her hands and put gloves on. My hubby tells me that she had to literally JUMP BACK when they broke my water, cuz there was that much. <br>  <br>  That didn't happen with my other 2, but I have had the experience. It's all about how your body prepares for the pregnancy.|`|Fx9nJ6mPaa	Ive had 4 kids...I squirted water/pee/blood, with 1 of mine, and I was really embarrassed,  & I was sitting there while pushing saying sorry is that supposed to happen, my dr. said it's normal push,so I think every pregnancy is different...but its not dramatic...my water broke with my other 2 before I was pushing, and the dr broke my water with 1, so it all depends...So, it's ok...|`|H3h4j4aKaa	when mine broke i don't remember it squirting lol i remember feeling like someone dropped a warm bucket of water on my lap but it wasn't too bad it's totally normal and i pooped on the table which i really didn't want to do but in the moment of pushing that baby out it's the last thing you are thinking about|`|IUuUoiZhaa	not all the time but when ur giving birth u dont get scared u just get happy noing that ur giving life to what someday could be a famous olymipimic winner or a big singer or the president but no matter wht ur happy u gave life to a human!!!!and u will always love them!!!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Labor is very, very messy!  It's not like u see in the movies.  There is lot of fluids involved and depending on the person---that can occur.  I know I filled an entire hefty garbage bag with all my fluids.  BUT--the good thing is---ur so busy in labor, you dont realize.  I only knew about all my "mess" cuz my hubby was sweet enough to make jokes about it . LOL|`|67FH2HoMaa	Everyone is different, some peoples water just trickles out while others there is a big gush. But I don't think it will be that dramatic.|`|yea2hci5aa	My doctor broke mine and it just leaked out slowly over the bed.|`|KOqaRmJQaa	As a mother of three I can tell you that childbirth is anything but what you or the books would expect. Everyone and every birth is different. The "water" that was squirted everywhere could have been anything from the waters or urine. When you are contracting and pushing...anything and everything can be discharged from your body. That's why they tell you to go to the bathroom before you get too far along and why you should only have ice chips...|`|2LUa46c6aa	No its nt that dramatic......nt all ppl r the same, different things happen 2 different ppl. i gav birth 19 months ago and mine just felt like i pissed on myself. kinda like i was holdin a water balloon and it poped, but it didnt squirt out.|`|vrHeGvy2aa	When my water broke with first pregnancy, I felt like I had to go to the bathroom and when I stood up it trickled out.  Gradually, there was more and more water.  With my 2nd, the doctor broke my water and it kinda felt like a balloon popping inside me but no spraying.  That's strange.  I've never heard of that.|`|079d2408b404792068cec1c2e4eb8488aa	Mine leaked over about a 2 weeks period. I have heard people say it gushes out sometimes but never actually sprays, that is pretty weird..
R1eten5Haa	Oh man! I was on a cleaning frenzy! I had so much energy I was literally unable to sit down all day! I think we even went to the park the day before My third was born! The night that my first was born, my feet got so swollen I couldn't walk, and the OB told me to come in, and they were like, Oh, by the way, you are having regular contractions so we're going to keep you! LOL! With my last one, I was having some pretty hard contractions on and off the day before, but I was still pretty energetic. :-)<br>  Be patient, as hard as it is! Babies will come when they are ready, and they know when it is time. Blessings!<br>  <br>  PS, remember that the "drugs" can often over-sedate your baby, causing slow reflexes and low heart rate at birth, and the artificial pitocin can often cause undue stress on the baby during delivery which can have serious complications. God made our body the way it is for a reason, trust it. :-)|`|49c1ed9541d154d45ed38796a9a07ec3aa	i felt the same as any other pregnant day funny enough ,,,im guessing thats the way you feel ,,,,id hate to have been overdue though ya poor thing anyway enjoy your last days of sleepful nights :L its all about to change ,,congratulations ,,,,remember to try and relax and the labour will go easier and take all the drugs they work|`|kC7U3VK8aa	i felt really depressed, i was overdue with all three of my children, and i got to the point were i thought the pregnancy was never going to end. Good luck|`|bxlYleZkaa	I felt fit to burst, both times!|`|ZbnxGIsnaa	I was incredibly tired and ready for my son to be born, but at the same time I was incredibly nervous and scared as it was my first time to deliver.  I didn't know what to expect!|`|tmh42R6Caa	I was anxious and kind of scared.  Just scared of my water breaking in public and making a scene.  My parents made me sit on a beach towel when I was at their house.  I didn't have any contractions at all.  No real discomfort.  At 4 days overdue I was finally induced.  Just finish up any last minute preperations you may have because you're going to be out of commission for a while - especially if you have a c-section.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	My friend was pregnant and due in about 2 weeks.  i went to her house and I immediately knew she would have the baby within a few days.  She had thrown up her dinner and was just "blah".  She looked very tired which wasn't normal for her.  That night, her water broke at 1am.<br>  <br>  With me, I felt perfectly fine before I went into labor.. just anxious.|`|VClxXNs3aa	pi$$ed because the hospital sent me home telling me my water wasnt broke.<br>  <br>  but other than that, I felt normal.  except for the water leaking from my vag.|`|IngripgMaa	I got a burst of energy.  I was playing on the floor with my dogs!  It was a great day that day!|`|fZGBjtpVaa	About two days before giving birth I was up til 4:30am cleaning, no idea why.  <br>  The night before I gave birth I knew that I was going to go into labour, not sure how I knew.  I just did.<br>  I phoned my mum and told her to be up early and to make sure all my hospital bags are packed and there's enough petrol, she asked why, and I said I'm having the baby tomorrow.<br>  I must be psychic!|`|D12aiL9Taa	i felt fine i was a week before my due date when i had my daughter so i wasn't even thinking of giving birth at that point of time i just felt the same: a bit tired a bit uncomfortable but fine, then i woke up in the middle of the night thinking i had pee'd myself and it was actually my waters breaking big shock|`|i6mydMOyaa	I felt great!  We were being induced, so I knew it was my last day of pregnancy.<br>  During the day we up to a lake and let our dog swim and just enjoyed the sunshine.  At night we went to a HUGE BBQ with all of our friends!  It was a great time!<br>  <br>  The morning of the inducing I felt good too!  <br>  <br>  It was a wonderful experience!|`|p7414DYYaa	A little of both, I was very tired then got a sudden burst of energy, if you lower back is starting to bother you more than usual you will be going into labor soon, I would nap as much as you can, pamper yourself a bit and enjoy the moment|`|YLXpwqceaa	I wish I went on a cleaning mission. I was on bed rest for 3 months!<br>  <br>  I was depressed, but that was because I was ready to have her and the dr said not yet, but called me at 8 the next morning changing her mind wanting to induce me. lol<br>  <br>  I was happy then!|`|EunkYJ5Baa	i was exhausted went to bed early had a good sleep an was woke up with a show with my first son an pain with my second, bless ye love take care an good luck hope your wee one shows his/her face soon an the hard work begins lol x|`|Jjyl4YBsaa	i was nesting like crazy. i could not sleep & everyone kept telling me to sleep. i was anxious & just cleaning, cleaning & cleaning. :)|`|W6S6WpsNaa	I felt tired, and just "blah".
irHF6CBPaa	I was recently worried about my son having Torticollis and have a DR appointment I was freaking out and also posted a Q none of the A made me feel better until I did some research on the subject I found out a lot of good Inf. on it that made me feel better and alot of helpful tips if my son turns out to have this then I know he will get better but to be honest I don't think my son has it after reading all the Inf. just want to hear it from the DR you should look it up read on it get your self inform
fYMWDQLGaa	i think thts not a good advice, i would suggest you to finish the course and then get out of it asap, since u have only 4 months u can be active for all those months which is by the good for pregnancy and continue taking rest till u give birth to ur kid. goodluck,,|`|dR2bqUixaa	If I were you then I would stay in school and finish. You are only 6 weeks and you only have 4 months left in school. You will be out of school by the time you have the baby and you could look for a job during the rest of the time.|`|tdNfQWaAaa	I would stay and finish. Especially since you only have 4 months left. Good luck!|`|ZnwKjH6waa	I would def stay in school... u dont have long 2 go... finish it b/c u wont have as much time once the baby is born|`|SsB7aRExaa	Finish the course, of course!  I would be very suspicious of a person who advised you as this department head has done.  Be on your guard - I suspect you'll soon be pressured to have an abortion.
0SIhrYCbaa	I was at home on the telephone with #1. With #2 a was picking up my oldest one from the hospital. My water broke both times. <br>  My daughter was at the auto parts store when her water broke.|`|AA10313901	I was at home in the apartment we'd just gotten the day before I went into labor (my husband was in the military, so we had to make the move).<br>  <br>  I felt as if I needed to pee, and when I went to the bathroom my water broke ...and fluid gushed onto the floor!   It was everywhere, and the floor was suddenly all slippery, so I called to my husband who ran in and put towels all over the floor so I wouldn't fall.<br>  <br>  Needless to say, I was wide awake after that!|`|gyYXV3Bxaa	I had to be induced for medical reasons, so I was at the hospital.  <br>  <br>  I remember feeling a tightness around my ribs.  I thought it was just the baby stretching.  Then, the pain got worse!  I knew then that labor was beginning!!!|`|1CEApjyRaa	In my kitchen trying to make spaghetti but the stupid noodles wouldn't get soft lol|`|yCwPxulYaa	I was in my bed asleep....woke up to horrible cramps....got up to go pee....and SPLASH!<br>  <br>  10 hours later...Baby Abigail!|`|NpSVEC2naa	at home watching tv with my partner. he didn't believe me untill my water broke!|`|AA11981363	I was at home watching tv with my husband.|`|52bAHCaUaa	At home! My water broke...that was scary!|`|97d50db6a834f02ae3b73b75b4c0a135aa	All three I was home. I try not to go to far when I'm at the end of a pregnancy. However, labor takes more time than people think. The 1st kid i went into labor 3 days before my due date and active labor was about 5 hours. My other 2 were very late coming and I was actually induced in various natural ways...it still took my last one a couple of days before active and even then it took 3 shifts of mid-wives before she was born. My sister however, goes into labor and the babies are usually out in 3 hours or less...so if I were you...stay close to home.|`|5LVryyiEaa	Mine was freaky because they had already stopped me once and gave me medicine to take to stop it again if I needed to. A week later though I woke up needing to go the bathroom and I could feel like I was fixing to bleed and (i know its gross) and passed massive clots. So I was sleeping in my bed at 3:30 am lol.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	At home, on the couch, watching TV with my husband.  I had just polished off a bowl of Frosted Flakes and was getting ready for bed.  It was our last night to be alone and together sans baby since I was scheduled for a c-section in the morning.  I got up to put on my pjs and my water broke.  We went to the hospital shortly after that.|`|VXhOLgDEaa	I was at home waiting for the hospital to call me for my induction. But that afternoon...the nurse called and said my appointment would be delayed. Turns out by the time I got to the hospital I was 8 mm dialated. The cramps I had been getting all morning were contractions! I didn't even know...2 hours later my daughter was born. It was so easy I was kind of disappointed because for 10mths that's all I worried about day in and day out....it was so freakin' easy!|`|h85kkDsbaa	I was at home but i wasn't sure it was labor so i carried on as normal, me and my husband went into town (luckily it was a saturday and he was home) and after being in town for a while i knew i was in labor and had to go home.|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	with my first child i was at home in bed, but my water didn't break i just started cramping and with my second child i was induced, but my friend went in to labor at work|`|RwRCwJXMaa	I was at home watchin tv, ya i kno pretty boringggg|`|770d889719360ce32fe4bbcc5b4c9c19aa	In the hospital (I was induced)|`|YLXpwqceaa	Asleep, my dr called me and said get your butt to the hospital because we're inducing you right now. lol|`|AA11537580	in the hospital, I had to be induced.|`|oMuBsTw6aa	at a raveeeeeeeeeeeeee. :D lol|`|irHF6CBPaa	At home laying down|`|G2auAv1Saa	I was in the examining room at the doctors office... inside the hospital. <br>  Which was the best place imaginable to go into labor!|`|WlU3NFu6aa	at home. i woke up at 330 am it pee and when i wiped, i was still leaking.

1u4CS5J3aa	I would watch him to see if he acts funny. I mean if he doesnt interact with the others then he probably will be fine. Maybe leave a radio or a tv on for him to have noise, and lamp or two while you are gone. its a good idea anyway to have something on because then burglers will think you are home and be less likely to break in.<br>  if he acts depressed maybe get him a friend if you can have 2 cats.

TE7foNwMaa	I actually LOVE this name. Though, from everywhere I've looked, I've found Meissa pronounced MAY-suh....as in the star that makes the head of Orion. <br>  <br>  me-ISS-a might be a bit of a burden... That's a debate I have with this name. To me, it's actually slightly after my cousin, Melissa... And I know that most people who look at this name will most likely see it as a typo for Melissa... But I do LOVE the sound and look of the name, and I love my cousin... So, this is one of the top names on my middle name list. <br>  <br>  me-ISS-a is also a bit hard to say. It gets a bit jumbled together and kind of sounds like "messa / missa". Just as a warning. <br>  <br>  I do think she would have to constantly pronounce it for people, but you never know if she would grow up loving /or hating having a unique name. <br>  <br>  I love the meaning, though... "the shining one", and I love that it's a star, also. It seems so invincible, and I would personally LOVE to use it as a name (though I would most likely pronounce it MAY-suh)... but it possibly would be quite annoying to constantly correct people. <br>  <br>  It's all an opinion...and I really do love the name, and it's still something that I WOULD consider, though I'm not sure if I would ever actually use it. But if you're worried, anything with personal meaning makes a great middle name in my opinion. :)<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  -- Amy|`|TTpf5tlMaa	It's a very pretty name.  I wouldn't worry about the typo thing.  There are some crazy names out there, the current fad being to misspell common words, like Jazmin, which is correctly spelled jasmine.  <br>  <br>  On a side note, we currently live in a world where my name, SNOW, is misspelled and considered typoed all the time.  It's the white stuff on the ground... Why is that hard to understand...?|`|ValLVBcYaa	It's a nice name but yes, she would be called Melissa all her life. At first glance, I thought you had written Melissa and that's the way it would be for most people.<br>  It would be nice as a second name though.|`|c07C7D0laa	It's a nice name and she would be called melissa all her life because if somebody called her that she would correct them. Like I do when peole mispronounce my name. I think it's a wonderful orininal name!|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I don't like it and she will be called Melissa by everybody.|`|6YnwXCIaaa	I read that as Melissa and was going to come in and suggest you choose a different name.  I'm still suggesting that.|`|WIEPISyeaa	Sorry, I actually thought it was a typo myself...... :(  Maybe try to spell it differently.  <br>  <br>  Mayissa?|`|W2JUHdSfaa	i think its pretty|`|86C2NDIcaa	Well, actually, the star itself is pronounced MAY-suh...which I personally like a bit better than me-ISS-a.|`|aa8d66371ff46d7a821623d9f0e9c6bfaa	Maybe u can spell it like this Me'Issa|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I would use it for a middle name, that way she doesn't have to tell everybody her name over and over and always get her name mispronounced and people will always mess up and call her Melissa. I think that it is cute and unique althought it is not my taste, Lillian Meissa works.|`|qitXGd0qaa	She'd probably get Melissa or Merissa with a typo alot.<br>  <br>  I think its a pretty name, nice origin/meaning, but yeah, it could be somewhat of a burden as far as pronouncing and spelling go.|`|d6e11chxaa	Honestly, I like the idea of the name, but when I saw your question, I assumed it was a typo of Melissa, or maybe Messiah. It would be a great name to tuck in the middle, where it's daring but doable, but not one I'd use in an English speaking country. It sounds very pretty, but I don't think it works. Sorry!|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	It's OK, but yes, I think lots of people would assume the name is Melissa. What about the name Misa [pron. Mee-sa]? It's similar in pronounciation, but it's a totally seperate name.|`|AA11273571	Meissa would be a terrible messa.|`|hy91mZMWaa	Uh..yuh think???
AA10426129	Its very normal. They tend to sleep during the day. Any time your baby is asleep during the day you need the wake him up. No naps during the day.|`|AA10888290	sounds like a growth spurt to me.|`|3oSQQt6maa	Hmmm.... try to keeo him awake as much as you can during the day. My son sleeps about three times in the day and sleep through night. But i make alot of noise to keep him active.<br>  If it doesn't work then you should try sleeping him in different positions.|`|8Oh1UUqvaa	I know how you feel. My son was the same way. Do you pick him up right away when he fusses? I use to do it until one day I just let him be, and he fell asleep on his own. He could also be teething. My son up to this day does that whenever his teeth are coming in. Dont worry...it will pass!|`|C8fBt7Rxaa	I recommend you have him checked for sleep apnea and that you have his tonsils and adenoids checked out.  Sleep Apnea is easily cured with a CPAP.<br>  <br>  You may also want to try putting him to sleep on his stomach. Prior to 1992 over 70% of U.S. babies slept on their stomachs. You may want to let him sleep on your stomach first though to see how he likes it.<br>  <br>  Infants who sleep on their backs compared to infants who sleep on their stomachs have increased rates of: <br>  - Social skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - Motor skills delays at 6 months (Dewey, Fleming, et al, 1998) <br>  - gastroesophageal reflux (GER) (Corvaglia, 2007) <br>  - Milestone delays (Davis, Moon, et al., 1998)<br>  - Plagiocephaly, Torticollis, Strabismus, etc. etc.<br>  <br>  Plus, stomach sleep tends to prevent hip subluxation and reduce the symptoms of colic.|`|gyixPyOsaa	my son was like that and still won't sleep through the night and he is 3 years old. you know what will help you is the first time he gets up put him in bed with you. he will fall asleep faster and you can too. that saves a lot of up and down while this is going on. i also went and bought a tv series like "friends" so i could turn it on while i was trying to get him to sleep then i would just hit pause. then when he got up again i would hit play. it helps focus on something other than the fact that all you want is to go back to sleep. and i used tv series cause my son Gabriel got up so much during the night and i didn't want to have to get up and switch movies when they got to the end. the tv series just go and go and go. also when he got a little older i would leave a bottle in the corner of his crib for him. he would get thirsty. he still wakes up for his sippy cup at night. or he would wake up for his binky so i bought those pacifier clips and clipped it on his PJ's at night(always on the same side of his shirt) so he knew where to find it so i didn't' have to get up. i even tried letting him cry like the dr told me too and he cried for 5 hours non stop. it didn't work. but you could try it. hope this helps. some kids just don't sleep. but his dr told me the babies that don't sleep are the brightest. the one that sleep all the time are going to be slow when they get older. so its hard now but its a good sign|`|SSFy8eHNaa	Could be teething.<br>  Have you tried to just let him fuss for about 10 minutes?<br>  I mean if he is screaming bloody murder thats a different story.<br>  <br>  Babies wake up throughout the night and they need to learn to self soothe to go back to sleep.  Its good to let them work it out.|`|vewYW4wcaa	i would get him checked for an ear infection, my son has had lots of them, and the poor little guy cant sleep at all when the fluid and pressure is painful when they lay down.|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	Watch his breathing for as long as he will sleep at one time.  To start count his respiration's (one breath in and one breath out) for one full minute... write that number down.  When he falls asleep his breathing will slow down and if he is dreaming maybe speed up, what you are looking for is pauses in his breathing.  Apnea.  If he having trouble breathing or stops all together call the Dr.  If this is an ongoing problem with him you should think about calling his Dr anyway.  Get him into a bedtime routine,playtime, bath for as long as he wants to play in the tub, bottle then bed.  he might not know yet how to soothe himself back to sleep, you could try like a heartbeat cd or ocean waves. For one night you might consider getting someone to watch him, Grandma? best friend? so you can get caught up on some sleep.
Drnpe4T5aa	If you decide to "diet", make sure you do it with your son in mind:<br>  Don't eat lots of stuff with artificial sweeteners or additives - anything you eat will come out in your milk.<br>  Don't take any weight loss drugs, even natural ones or herbal ones - your son does not need to lose weight!  <br>  Make sure you are still getting adequate nutrition - especially calcium.<br>  If you cut back too far on you cal intake, you may discover a drop in your production.  I found that right about the time I lost  lbs was when I would suddenly dry up.  Drinking extra fluids can help combat this.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	u are taking in wayyyyy too many calories; it wouldn't hurt anything to decrease your intake; every extra 3500 calories equals another pound of fat....i wouldn't go to 1500 since you are breastfeeding, but i would try to shoot for 2000 to 2500 and see how that goes.....if for some reason you start to lose too much weight, you can always increase it; and if you find you aren't losing some weight, decrease to 1800, etc...good luck, sometimes ppl eat for emotional reasons and such and if you are doing that, you will have to deal with the prob that is making you overeat so much or you may not have a lot of success with the diet..hth|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	You definately DO NOT need that many calories in a day. Dont go below 1500, but stay somewhere between 1500-2000. <br>  Remember bfing DOES burn 500 calories a day...so thats why you should not go below 1500.<br>  Also, sounds like you are not eating the right foods. you need to throw out the junk..go grocery shopping..and replace all white grain stuff with whole grain and whole wheat. Switch ground beef to ground turkey. Eat lots of lean meats, get rid of sodas and stuff loaded with sugar, and if you need a snack try a protein shake with fruit blended in.<br>  <br>  I have lost 40lbs over the last 8 months with, the diet I wrote above, and I workout 5 days a week (weight training) all while breastfeeding!<br>  <br>  So basically you NEED to lower your calorie intake, switch to healthier foods..NO FAST FOOD and stay out of restaurants if you can..also..if you cant get to a gym to cardio from home..you WILL lose the weight|`|6xuQqEMJaa	Congrats on breastfeeding! <br>  I know what you mean, i could not stop eating with my first and i actually gained pretty much everything i had lost after giving birth!<br>  But you do need more calories to stay healthy when BFing.<br>  <br>  Weight Watchers specifically addresses this situation in the points program.  it allows you more points--more calories--and you still get to lose weight.<br>  <br>  i personally waited until i was done BFing before dieting because i was enjoying the food and i felt that i was already depriving myself with all the other restrictions and my DD's food allergies...<br>  After BFing, i lost the weight fast--20lbs in 13 weeks- and kept them off until my next pregnancy.<br>  <br>  Hang in there and i hope you decide what is right for you<br>  <br>  here is a link i found<br>  <br>  HTH<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.weightwatchers.com/util/art/index_art.aspx?tabnum=1&art_id=24571&sc=803" rel="nofollow">http://www.weightwatchers.com/util/art/i...</a>|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	Ok.  You have my exact problem.  I am one of the few unlucky nursing moms that hasn't lost all the baby weight.  Well I know you did but you are putting it back on so something is up.  <br>  <br>  Yes you can diet while nursing.  Weight Watchers has a plan for nursing moms and it works. <br>  <br>  I personally don't believe that you need a bunch of extra calories.  I am like you and not a skinny minny so we obviously have plenty of fat stores for milk production.  I have had zero problems with supply since I have been dieting.  <br>  <br>  My dr. says that once my son weans I will probably lose weight easier because some women just hold on to their fat while nursing.  It happens.
H0fXySX9aa	if its done on purpose then yes|`|hUYaaXBvaa	it's sort of  irresponsible<br>  is kind of a burden to your potential in life as a young person, who isn't even completely on their own yet and doesn't really have money<br>   its not so great for the kid, because there parents probably won't stay together, or your parents, who may have to slightly surrogate your child until your more responsible<br>  <br>  oh if this is you sorry idm't mean to sound harsh, its just what i think. hopefully you have some kind of support (if its you), and you can make the best of your situation that you are given|`|ZNhP3mpUaa	Yes. 2 points.|`|kT7GVOosaa	if you are trying to have a baby then yes that is a bad idea.

Inopportune, yes.  Think of what is given up having a baby at such a young age.  While other kids are applying to college, someone having a baby must find and unskilled job (because of lack of education) to support a helpless life.  With the job market as abysmal as it is now, it doesn't seem like a good time to bring any life into this world.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	I had my daughter in septmeber of my senior year... I don't think it's wrong unless you plan to have it. Babies come in all different unexpected ways. But if you do have a baby in high school you need to take responsiblity and either give it up to someone who can take care of it or work your a$s off to be the best parent to that child. It's wrong have a child at any age if your not willing to take care of it!|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Yes it's wrong. Your mind shouldnt be on having sex it should be on finishing school and hopefully going to college. I dont understand when it became the think to do for all these kids to have sex...WITHOUT PROTECTION AT THAT....and get pregnant. It looks bad on you and your parents. If your going to do it atleast have enough respect for your self to get some birth control and make him wear a condom. It's too much stuff out there  to just be having sex with some boy with no protection.|`|EJ8iS9R4aa	if it's planned yes, you should wait til you graduate and have job and good guy and have fun first. But if it wasn't planned there's not much you can do, I got pregnant with my daughter when I was 16 and had her when i turned 17. It was really hard to continue my education but i kept my mind focused and knew that getting my diploma meant a lot if i wanted to support my daughter. I'm 20 now with a great full time job and my daughter is 3 . It wasn;t planned for me but stuff happens,and I'mm still with her dad who is very supportive.|`|7zMtmKJaaa	of course its wrong.

Whoever she is just basically threw her life away.

Because there is a big risk having a baby at your age. And then having to pay for the baby cost a lot of money. There will be no more time for your friends. You are giving up your childhood. you can only be a child one time so enjoy your childhood now. You have your whole life time to have a baby. you need to get done with school then get a good job and get married to a good man then you will be ready to have a baby. you may want one now, but I will be very hard if you have a baby now.

OI3bf4yjaa	When my daughter is old enough to be taught right from wrong.. you bet she'll get spanked ONLY when it's necessary. I will only resort to spanking when nothing else works like time-outs, or taking toys away etc. Most people are angry with people who are for spanking, because they see spanking as abuse. It is NOT abuse, it is only abuse when a parent takes advantage of it.|`|8ed1c4b4b5ab2e0f6329de8048b39995aa	Well, like anything else, its a matter of judgement.  You can certainly see how easy it would be to get carried away with spanking and cause physical permanent damage - so you are depending on the adult to be able to control him or herself at all times.<br>  <br>  After all, think how easy it would be to really hurt a tot when you are really angry about something innocent that caused havoc.  The kid is playing with a ball and bounces it into the flat screen destroying it.<br>  <br>  Now, are you going to hit the kid for playing with a ball when you told him not to, or are you going to hit the kid with all the strength of someone who just saw $1500 just go up in smoke?<br>  <br>  Personally, I think spanking is fine if you only do it when YOU are not angry.  If you are angry, you shouldn't trust yourself.|`|PdY9ylZCaa	i'm for spanking; i was spanked as a child--i learned my lesson, so i wasn't spanked often. <br>  <br>  i don't consider myself a violent person. i do consider myself quite successful with my life: relationships, career. so we'll not talk about: people who were spanked grow up to be "blah blah blah" <br>  <br>  i will probably spank my children if they are naughty. the worse (read: obnoxious, bratty) people i know are those who had "time out" instead firm discipline as children.|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	i raised my sons and they got spanked. they turned out good but you know what you were probably getting a child talking to you. they sure dont' beleve in it and there are alot of them out there that are rude. especially to adults.

People get in their minds what they think is right and that's it. there's not much you can do about it except know that you are the parent and you will do what is best for your child. and unless you are seriously physically harming your child they should not judge you. No one does anything the same . whos to say what the right or wrong way is. just keep your head up and ignore ignorance.|`|PxawVQ7Xaa	If I said I hit my wife, I bet you'd be quick enough to judge me, it's not because it's a different style of parenting they're annoyed because you're hitting some one, if you saw some one hitting some one else you'd probably feel pretty disgusted at them, so why are you any different than any one else who uses violence?|`|kjgonYlgaa	Small children, definitely not!  They have no understanding of why the person they love more than anything in this world is hurting them.  Older children 5 - 10 maybe a little smack on the butt, more to get their attention than anything, as they're sometimes uncontrollable.  Older than 10, That's pretty humiliating.|`|xubIaiZaaa	i see no problem with spanking, however i would always use it as a last resort, i find that time out works really well with talking to your child and telling them why their behaviour is wrong, however if my child was being too naughty for time out to work then a smack is what they're gonna get!|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	why people are against spanking is because the public as drilled into there head that spanking is abusive it teaches kids to hit. which is totally crazy because it not|`|BRT2teSqaa	This topic is SO worn out!

Anyone with half a brain can see that this generation, the ones who haven't been spanked are brats, rude, ignorant...should I go on??? The is a VAST DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SPANKING & ABUSE!!! You never hurt a child! But proper spanking is not meant to hurt, just to correct inappropriate behaviour. If done correctly you only have to do it once or twice & the child will know that when you say something they listen & obey immediately, trust me it works.

IU4uNH97aa	We are teaching my kids to speak french. From the time they were born we have spoken both french and english around them. They know both languages. I want them to know both. When they get older and go to school i want them to learn french in school or possibly go to a french immersion school.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	If you want a child to be bilingual, the best way is to start be using both languages equally as soon as s/he starts learning to talk.<br>  <br>  Now, if you don't already speak the second language yourself, it is a lot harder. <br>  Once your child starts watching (sitting down with his bottle and staring at the screen) television, have at least half if not all of his programming be in the second language.  I think it would also be best if you gained some fluency yourself so that you are able to reinforce what is learned without confusing your child with inaccurate pronunciation.<br>  <br>  <br>  As for which language . . .  that's hard to say.<br>  German (and other germanic languages) are most similar to English and will be easiest for you.<br>  Spanish and other romantic (French, Italian) languages are all incredibly similar, and Spanish is on the rise as a popularly spoken language in the US.<br>  Japanese, Korean, and especially Chinese, are more difficult to learn as adults, but are also very useful in technology, business, and politics.<br>  Another option is Arabic which, as I haven't been around many Arabic learners, I'm sorry to say I know little about.<br>  <br>  <br>  Whichever you chose, you can't go wrong.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|kowvnRhXaa	well, my kids are bilingual english/german... spanish is probably the best living in the usa... i started from birth... kids are the best sponges if started early enough.  after reading as much as i could about bilingualism it seems the best ages to learn a language are birth-3yrs and then again from 11-16years old.  good luck!|`|vhMe2oCGaa	My husband parents are from denmark but my husband has always lived here as have my children however he was raised with both english and danish. and he is fluent in both languages plus italian. i myself can on speak english and bits and pieces in danish. that ive picked up(and im fluent in sign language )<br>  our children have being raised learning both danish and english . since they were learning to talk we have use both languages. our eldest who is six can speak fluently in danish and english . <br>  i think when they were learning it was a bit confusing because they were learning two words for each thing but once they have them they were away .<br>  i think its wonderful that they can speak two languages and also find that they speak to their dad or each  often in danish when they want to keep something a surprise from me  its very cute<br>  i wouldnt mind them picking up sign language to.|`|aZwaCKgdaa	Spanish.  I live in San Diego -- learning Spanish is necessary.  My 3rd grader is learning it in school and I speak a little at home (I am not of Hispanic decent, but see the importance of being bilingual).  My 3-year old understands a bit, but doesn't speak Spanish.  I speak in both Spanish and English to my 10 month old.  It is much easier to learn and absorb languages when you are very young -- under two preferably.|`|iNYDUFdGaa	I would pick American Sign Language.

Z0KQenm9aa	you must speak to your midwife and or doctor... you are paying them... they are required to care for you, their patient... ask them... some times doctors are going on vacation and they want to deliver you before they go... whatever... however my opinion is that when the fruit is ripe it will fall from the tree... having sex can induce labor naturally... and there is nothing wrong with sex while youre pregnant even at this late date... walk, go for car rides take a laxative, talk to your mom, your grandmother...|`|EHozsofQaa	I was one week overdue for both my kids when I was induced. But they need to schedule the appointment with you a few days earlier in order to make sure that they'll room for you at labor and delivery. That's normal. What day did they give you an appointment?
Zg1ih6gcaa	Will sleep through the night, should take an afternoon nap for 2-3 hours<br>  They can be picky eaters but not usually as bad as the older toddlers<br>  They have short attention spans; they'll pick out a toy, play with it for a minute and be on to the next one.  They can trash a play room in minutes.<br>  They will eat things off the floor but they don't suck on toys as much as infants<br>  Their attention span is short and they can't really hold pens/pencils so you could do a brief finger painting or sticking something on paper....but not much for crafts with this age.<br>  Depends on the child how much they talk anywhere from a few words to short sentences<br>  They move fast, though they don't really run yet.<br>  They will play mostly alone or side by side with another child.  As far as playing with you, sure, they enjoy little games with their toys<br>  Yes they can climb stairs (and many other things!!!)<br>  A bit early to start potty training.  Usually give kids until age 2 or longer for boys.<br>  They like learning easy songs.  They like to dance.  They will enjoy a book being read to them.  When I worked at the daycare, they loved bubbles, making paper hats (we essentially made the hats, they just took them on and off).  They liked to play outside and chase each other around.  They enjoyed ring around the rosey, building blocks and knocking them over.  <br>  <br>  18 months is a great age!  They're old enough to have fun personalities but young enough to still want to cuddle sometimes.  Have a blast!<br>  Some may have tantrums but usually that's something that really starts in full force at a bit older.|`|vewYW4wcaa	-They sleep a lot less than 7 month olds<br>  -THey are beginning to learn when they like to eat and may not eat what you give them<br>  -They are into EVERYTHING! keep all the doors closed and make sure the cupboards are locked<br>  -crafts might end up a total mess, but if controlled and well prepared for is fun, do something with food, then they will get a snack and not eat glue or anything<br>  -they can probably say quite a few words but are still hard to understand, and very capable of repeating everything they hear<br>  -they are learning to interact and communicate with others so group playtime is really fun<br>  -They can climb stairs! and climb a lot of other things you wouldnt think they could<br>  -Simple things like counting books and games, easy puzzles, cars and dollies, building blocks, all these usually keep their attention|`|AA11191851	Honestly, there's not much of a difference between an 18 month old and a 2 year old...Except that they may not speak much...Only a few words like mama, dada...the basics....<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|CpWGvDvRaa	First of all..ALL children are different!!!! There is honestly NO way anyone could know how that particular 18 month old is until they are around them. But here is how mine is:<br>  <br>  How often and when did they sleep? She usually naps once a day when she decides she is tired. She is a night owl though.<br>  <br>  Were they picky eaters? Sometimes she is. One day she will like something and the next...nope.<br>  <br>  Are they into everything? Oh yeah! Big time! Climbs on everything too.<br>  <br>  Do they still eat everything? Yup...she has always been a mouth baby.<br>  <br>  Are they old enough for fun crafts? If so, which ones? Oh yes! Anything that they can stay focused on and does not involve something to harm the child (i.e. sharp objects or toxic materials.) My daughter loves to draw and paint. <br>  <br>  How much can they talk? Depends. Some talk a little, some talk perfectly.<br>  <br>  How fast can they walk/run? Depends. My daughter RUNS everywhere.<br>  <br>  Do they like to play together or alone mostly? Depends on what they are use to<br>  <br>  Can they climb stairs? usually. Walk with them and teach them to count. My son had learned how to count to 23 by age two.<br>  <br>  Is this a good time to start potty training? Boys are harder, but yes, you can.<br>  <br>  What kinds of things are they ready to be taught? Depends. You can teach a child anything if they can stay focused. READ to them. <br>  <br>  Anything else? demeanor? tantrums? favorite activities and toys? etc.  Again, just depends on the kid. All kids are different. <br>  <br>  Good luck
GWveqx61aa	i have heard of ppl guessing and being correct, well hopefully this is one of those times,good luck and baby dust to us all|`|WIEPISyeaa	Have you tested yet?  I dunno....maybe you have that "glow!"  Good luck and congrats if so!|`|oiJITSNZaa	Take a pregnancy test.|`|ommWXJeFaa	Yes all the time, my sis's in law always say u look different i can see it in your eye's to family and friends that periods are late and they always have positive pregnancy tests. I recently said it to my sis in law because she looked a little pale and her eyes looked tired and she came back pregnant.|`|BGMWKTqSaa	im currently in ur situation. im usuall every 24-26 days. short i know. and usually 4 days long. i did not have it this month. im actually 15 days late now.  my mother in law out of the blue said that she had a dream i was prego. and my mom was like is somebody having moodswings... i asked why she said that and she said a mother knows. lol but so far ive had two neg test with my first son this happend also but i just would rather find out! so period either come or get a pos test!!!!!!!|`|1NEbsemjaa	yes actually my mother in law said the same thing to once. I took a test the next day and I was in fact pregnant. you should take a test just in case
S4DNQkFraa	I had two negs and I just knew I was preg. I think I may have read the test wrong because I almost did this time. I had a miscarriage in 2007. When I thought I may be preg. this time I took two tests, one was neg. and I thought the 2nd one was neg. to, but I read it again, I almost tossed it!! I wish you luck!!|`|CGFAPKJOaa	I'm sorry dear, but that is just very rare. If you are trying to conceive, try tracking your ovulation and that might help.
GWveqx61aa	what makes you think you have pcos?and absolutely pcos can stop you from getting preg, i have pcos my symptoms are hair where it shouldnt be, weight gain, irregular periods, and diffuculty acheiving pregnancy, go see your dr and see if he will put you on clomid, or start vitex and soy iso flavones. take vitex every day as directed on bottle andtake suggested dose of soy isoflavones on days 3-7 and see if that helps, this may not always help, got any additional questions contact me via email, good luck and baby dust to all of us|`|JpIqgtmvaa	Check out this website maybe it can help you with what you are dealing with,
oYmZUO8Caa	What about Bleu?|`|E8kzNG3iaa	Monterey Jack - first and middle name<br>   <br>  (my favourite)|`|mx3YK5rLaa	I think Pepperjack or Parmesean. Colby is the best bet though; it's a real name PLUS it is a cheese!|`|fboC1N7gaa	I think they should go for Munster!|`|T1X3pRt6aa	I second the Colby above! Brilliant!!|`|3vNecJ2waa	I'd tell them to go with Colby, instead.  Not nearly as cheesy...   Colby Jack if they need a middle name|`|Elxuvon8aa	you made me laugh|`|LSxBwiFSaa	Gee- I dunno... -Sounds kinda cheesy to me!  :)  Why don't they just name Him, "Limburger"- & leave it go at That ?!  Better YET, they could name Him, "Brat" !  "Brie & Brat"- sounds kinda catchy, doesn't it ??!  I wonder if they're German... ... .  :)
04fd2039534f9759f9ec4ae1101ff131aa	She doesn't have too. Some doctors will only do it if they find it medically necessary of if the baby is late. I asked mine and she said she'd do it at 39 weeks and she did and then again at 40 weeks and nothing happened. I'm 3 days over my due date and no baby yet. I'm dilated at 2 and effaced 50%. Good Luck with your baby. If you do choose to get it done, practice your lamaze breathing because its pretty uncomfortable.|`|xyI7PRuhaa	no she doesn't have to.  If she doesn't think that it is safe or appropriate she can say no.  If you go into labor after 36 weeks on your own, your dr won't stop you.  However, current recommendations and standards of practice are not to induce or encourage labor until 39 weeks.  This, of course, is as long as there are no medical indications to get the baby out sooner.  If that was the case, stripping membranes would not be the way it would be done.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	NO they do not have to stip your membraines.  It is best for the baby and for you to go as long as the baby needs.  But if they offer it I'm sure it's better then leaving the baby in there for medical reasons.|`|ZEYEmYRtaa	No she does not have to, but they usually they will.<br>  They will insert 2 fingers in to your vagina and twist them around the cervix..<br>  This does not hurt but is a little un comfy.<br>  This managed to bring me in to labour at 38 weeks so beware lol<br>  Congrats on your baby news xx|`|ggfE4rlvaa	I asked mine to do it and she did. I was 39 weeks though. I don't imagine 38 would be much different. Unfortunately this did nothing for me. I did go into labor 4 days after but, i doubt it had anything to do with this procedure. It could work for you though! Give it a try, good luck and congrats!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	Nope, the Dr. only has to do what is medically necessary and stripping the membranes early is not a necessity.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	They do not have to if they deem it is not medically necessary|`|D9ufwiMXaa	No the Dr. doesn't, you aren't past due and it isn't medically necessary at this point.<br>  Good luck
jYBl7AVQaa	It's fine if she sleeps on her stomach that's not a problem especially at 4 months. If she can roll herself on her stomach she knows not to leave her face down in the crib to suffocate. <br>  <br>  They used to say to sleep babies on their stomach to keep them from getting sids then they changed it to sleeping them on their back. In a year they'll probably go back to telling you to sleep them on their stomach. <br>  <br>  If that's how your baby is comfortable, i'd definately let her sleep that way. But like you mentioned be very careful not to leave stuffed animals or pillows in the crib. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps|`|n6XYYyoLaa	as long as she rolls herself you have nothing to worry about...as long as the crib is empty, she is fine....lay her on her back still, but if she rolls leave her alone....:)|`|pXSKSS3daa	If she's able to roll around then she'll be fine. I know you're going to still worry because that's what mommies do best but SIDS decreases when your baby is able to roll.<br>  <br>  There isn't much you can do to prevent her from getting on her side or belly at this point so you're better off trying to accept it rather than fight with it.|`|4BBjhHAnaa	When we breathe, we exhale carbon dioxide.  This, on its own, is deadly.  When we sleep, we can sometimes create pockets of carbon dioxide between our airways and a blanket, pillow, or some other obstruction.  Our natural reaction when this happens in our sleep, is just to move our head a little bit to disrupt the pocket and be able to breathe again.  You may do this several times a night and never notice.<br>  It seems to be that SIDS is when an infant creates a pocket and is not strong enough to move her head in her sleep and allow herself to breathe.<br>  <br>  Since your daughter has no trouble rolling over, she is probably just fine.<br>  There are always risks in parenting,  but billions of babies have slept on their tummies throughout all of history and been just fine :)|`|u94HOVz7aa	they say when they roll over on their own you don't have to keep reposition them.  if they are strong enough to roll over then they are strong enough to lift their move their faces so no to suffocate while sleeping.   just start them on their backs and let hem go from there.  at two month me son already rolls up on his side to sleep and if i reposition he won't sleep.|`|zwctZ812aa	Experts agree that once a baby can easily roll to their belly from their back, the risk of SIDS decreases dramatically.  Now that your daughter can easily roll, she will roll back to her side or her back if she gets into a position where she can't breath.  My son has been doing the same thing lately, he is also 4 months, and his pediatrician told me not to roll him back onto his back and just let him sleep how he is comfortable.  I'm sure your daughter will be fine, just let her sleep how she wants to.  If you're really that worried,you could try getting a sleep positioner so she can't roll, but I would just let her be. Up until about 5 years ago babies were always put to sleep on their tummies for fear of them choking on spit up and we all survived!|`|nQyJFOMZaa	I was wondering the same thing! My son has rolled onto his tummy as I am typing to sleep I gave up rolling him back he would either wake up or just roll right back. I ask his DR and he told me that once they have learned to roll there isn't really a need to stop them, I don't think they will smother themselves I have stayed awake all night just watch my son before and he always moves when he puts his head face down for too long, but I really stress about it too!|`|5qDWCOnRaa	Both of my babies have slept on their tummies.  I started turning them on their stomaches when I laid them down for a nap one day, and my daughter threw up.  She started choking and flailing her little arms, but did not turn her head.  I grabbed her up, and after a coughing sputtering spell she was fine.  But what if it had been in the middle of the night? and I hadn't been standing right there?  <br>  <br>  I should say too, they could hold their heads up by this time too.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	When I was born in the 70's, they told my mother that babies should sleep on their stomach (due to the risk of spitting up and choking). Doctors switched, switched again and now it's that they suggest babies sleep on their backs.<br>  <br>  My child always slept on her side and then moved to her stomach. Plenty of babies will move to their stomaches, so don't stress yourself. And if she's able to roll, you've reduced the risk if she's that strong.<br>  <br>  Worrying is natural. She's going to be fine. :-)|`|vsFJZRkGaa	tess's answer is spot on.<br>  <br>  to help ease your worry, pick a good book and read beside your baby while she has her daytimenaps. watch her while she sleeps and see for yourself how strong and capable she is.<br>  <br>  if you see her in action you're confidence in her strength will increase, and soon you'll be confident not to worry during the night.|`|3cxwalh0aa	She's fine :) <br>  <br>  Just lay her down on her back... if she's strong enough to get to her tummy from there, she can roll any which way she needs to. I do this with my twin girls and half the time I find them on their tummies.|`|AA10888290	My daughter has preferred to sleep on her tummy since she learned how to roll over.  I think you should supervise her naps and see if she has any trouble rolling back.  You will get more comfortable and I think she will be fine.|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	First relax...... if what she is doing worries you call her pediatrician.  I have four sons, when they learned to start moving around and rolling over I found them in all sorts of positions I didn't leave them in, including face down turned to the side and knees folded up to him tummy and fanny in the air.  Just make sure her bed doesn't have anything other than her in it, peek in on her and adjust her only if you find her face stuck to the rails on the bed ( yeah found that too)  But seriously call her Dr.  You might have to decide between rolling her at night and both of you losing sleep and letting her make her first decision on her own..... how she likes to sleep.|`|qQsFTkWmaa	i really wouldnt worry about it.. With my son he would refux(without acid) so bad he would choke to near death.. if layed on his back..<br>  <br>  also he LOVED to sleep on his tummy and could rll from back-tummy by 2mths.. so i got a body postioner... it kept him on hi side.. so he wouldnt go full tummy but wouldt go to his back to choke<br>  <br>  we had no blankets on him unless he was co-sleeping we dressed him warm in a sleeper (PJ's w.feet)<br>  <br>  but also children born to your grandmother were told to put babys on therre tummys...  so it cant be as deadly as all that..<br>  <br>  <br>  but side sleeping saved us...
gAP9PCTFaa	Hi<br>  <br>  I had a miscarriage in November at 6 weeks. It was painful but not agony although everyone is different. It was most painful right before I passed the baby/tissue and afterwards was just like a period.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately I was 10 weeks pregnant and have been told baby has died so am waiting to miscarry again. I have been told to expect more pain and bigger baby/tissue this time as 10 weeks pregnant<br>  <br>  To be honest, if you do not hemorage or have an infection the worst pain of all is emotional.....my heart has have never hurt so much<br>  <br>  <br>  With regards to how many weeks can you miscarry at. The risky time is 4-6 weeks and the next 6-8 and then 8-12. After that apparently you have a much lower chance of miscarriage. After 20 weeks it is know as fetal demise and still birth not miscarriage as such.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps you|`|c67a2f77ab7471bed4b2f279ff05e2e1aa	The commonest time to lose a pregnancy is about 9 - 11 weeks. It starts with a little bleeding and a little pain, and after a day or two, both get worse.  If the bleeding and the pain are really dreadful, the woman should be taken to hospital, preferably by ambulance, and may need a D & C -  a minor operation to clear the womb of anything which hasn't naturally cleared.<br>  The "baby" may not be distinguishable from the placents and other stuff which comes away, and is unlikely to be separated out by the hospital staff , so don't expect to be offered a "body" for a funeral.|`|O5WberWnaa	i had a m/c where i bled,i cramped i was in a lot of pain.i was nearly 6 wks<br>  i also had a m/c when i was 12wks when i went for my scan there was no h/b.i never bled and i never had any pain.|`|MTF0Rz90aa	For what ever reason and there are several, the baby either dies inside the womb.Or something happens externally to the baby that results in the baby being ejected from the womb.<br>  Ja.|`|yvKktDapaa	im not pregnant,im only 13 but im writing this from things iv found on websites and general knowledege<br>  <br>  A miscarriage is the loss of a pregnancy before 24 weeks, with most miscarriages actually occurring during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. Unfortunately, miscarriage is very common, affecting one in eight pregnancies<br>  <br>  The most common symptom is bleeding from the vagina. Lower abdominal pain is also very common.<br>  <br>  Some women have no symptoms at all and the miscarriage is only diagnosed when they are given an ultrasound scan at their antenatal clinic. This is referred to as a 'silent miscarriage', and can be very distressing for the woman and her partner.<br>  <br>  i hope i helped|`|nRoD9Vpwaa	A miscarriage is defined as a pregnancy which ends in the loss of a baby before 24 weeks. After 24 weeks, if the baby is born and doesn't survive, it's known as a stillbirth and not a miscarriage. The great majority of miscarriages happen in the first three months.<br>  <br>  If you miscarry before week nine of your pregnancy, which is when most miscarriages take place, you will usually fully miscarry within a week of the onset of bleeding and the miscarriage will be like a very heavy period, usually lasting up to ten days. Unless you have very heavy bleeding or one-sided abdominal pain you are unlikely to be admitted to hospital and will usually have to go through the experience at home. If you lose any blood clots or tissue then it's an unpleasant, but good idea to collect them in a sterile jar to show to your doctor.<br>  <br>  Your doctor may conduct an internal examination to check your cervix. If your cervix has opened then a miscarriage is inevitable, even though it may not happen straight away. If the bleeding has fully stopped within two weeks then the miscarriage is probably complete and you won't need any further treatment. However, it's important to be sure that there are no remnants of the pregnancy left in the womb, so you should have a check-up with your doctor, who may refer you for an ultrasound to confirm that the womb is empty.<br>  <br>  If you experience a miscarriage after week nine, or you have prolonged bleeding (over 2 weeks), then the miscarriage may be 'incomplete', meaning that your uterus hasn't expelled all the pregnancy tissue. If your doctor suspects that the miscarriage is incomplete s/he will probably recommend that you go into hospital for a simple operation, called Dilation and Curettage, to ensure that the uterus is cleared of all the pregnancy tissue and so prevent infection. If you are diagnosed with an infection then you will be prescribed a course of antibiotics.<br>  <br>  If a miscarriage takes place after months three or four it may be more like going through labour and you are more likely to be sent to hospital to deliver|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	I have had two and both started when i was 5 weeks pregnant, right after i found out. I starting brown spotting, then cramping came and then tons of blood and clots. It like the heaviest period of your life and you pass massive amounts of blood clots. Its a horrible thing to go through. Some women need whats called a D&C to clear the rest of the miscarriage out but i did not. A miscarriage can occur at any time but is most likely to happen up to 3 months.|`|FfxgHWGxaa	i have just recently had a miscarriage. i did not have no pains. it all started off with brown staining. i was told that this was normal until a week l8r when it became bright red. you would think the it was just a heavier period. i was 3mths and had to go in to hospital to have a d&c to remove what was left of the baby. Hope this answers a few of your questions.|`|c369c7306456f90492efcd3202572c4caa	you can miscarry at any time during a pregnancy but evey miscarriage is different.  The baby an die inside the womb but you might not know for several weeks when you have a scan or start to bleed, or you can bleed quite badly including lumps/clots ect....|`|96HWpdkFaa	Alot of the time you will start to bleed. Mostly heavy bleeding with cramping...but some women only have a few spots of bleeding and have to have the rest of the baby taken out of them and then some women have a silent misscarige..it's rare but happens. theres no blood at all and they find out at there ultrasound when there is no heartbeat or sometimes no baby. <br>  You can have a misscarige at any time. But the most common time to have on is up to 12 weeks pregnant.|`|dnG7fhnbaa	You can miscarry at any number of weeks, up to 24, then it becomes a still birth. Theyare much more common before week 12 though.<br>  <br>  I have lost four babies...all at 7 weeks. With each one I experienced severe back and stomach pain followed by heavy bleeding and clotting and pain in the tops of my legs.<br>  <br>  The severe pain lasted between 12 and 40 hours with each miscarriage then gave way to normal period pain, the heavy bleeding and clotting lasted between 4 and 7 days before giving way to a normal period.<br>  <br>  If you have one early on the baby just comes out with the blood and clots...Although sometimes it doesn't come out, in which case you would have to go into hospital for a D&C to remove the remains if the baby. <br>  <br>  If you have a later one or a still birth you have to give birth to the baby, usually in hospital and they will help you organise cremation or burial.<br>  <br>  x

He born healthy and happy at 40 weeks.<br>  <br>  I am 5 weeks pregnant now and all last week (week 4) I had light brown spotting.  Its why I took a pregnancy test, I was supposed to be on my period but it was so light!<br>  <br>  If it gets any heavier, or you start having bad cramps or sharp shooting pains, you should seek medical attention.  <br>  <br>  Other than that, this sounds normal.<br>  <br>  Congrats momma!|`|uuHPneEcaa	its just old blood, but anytime u have questions like that u should ask ur doctor.

As long as it stays brown your fine. I had some pink spotting with my first. Not just when wiping but also on my undies. My doc said it was okay as long as it wasn`t bright red.<br>  <br>  I did have a molar pregnancy the baby was about five months. But, I didn`t realize I was pregnant. So, every subsequent pregnancy I`ve worried and stressed until I saw the heartbeat. Don`t worry, it is possible to have a normal pregnancy after a miscarriage.|`|AA10280194	Yes!  The exact same thing happened to me.  I was assured that it was old blood either from implantation or just the uterus stretching beyond what it's used to.  One other reason could be the beginning of the placenta formation.  Mine lasted off and on about a week or so and it looked like coffee or tea that was dropped onto a piece of paper - pretty much that color and consistency.  I'm 12 weeks now and it has been gone for a good while and not come back since.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!  :-)|`|BzvstX7uaa	I had the exact same thing and was worried and I was told it's normal and just old blood. I had more than "drops" though.<br>  <br>  Call your doctor if you are really worried about it just to make sure.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	brown discharge is either old blood or discolored vaginal discharge- not signs of a miscarriage. a mc would be associated with bright red blood, small clumps,and mild pain at this stage|`|ze9Pah8Gaa	Both of my miscarriages started the same way with a little bit of brown spotting that turned into blood and etc. So i hope you are not miscarrying but mine went down the same line. But i am currently 4 months and i had the brown spotting for 3 days at 5 weeks pregnant and nothing came of it. I was told that was from my uterus expanding. So good luck! it could be anything|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Sounds like implantation bleeding.  Happens in every...well most pregnancies...i didnt have it with my last for some reason.
72ku9DFMaa	Of your boys combos, I prefer Cale Richard.  Popularity really puts me off, and Caleb's all the way up there at #36...plus I guess it helps that I find Cale more aesthetically appealing, and I think it goes better with Richard anyway (since Caleb has the same syllabic rhythm as Richard, which tends to mess with the flow imo).<br>  <br>  I think Marina Hope is lovely and a million times better than Mekenna Hope, so I really do hope that that's what you (and/or your parents, ha, initially missed the bit where this is your sibling) end up going with.

I like both the girl names but leaning more towards Mekenna! it is so very cute.|`|VOmE0UFsaa	Caleb Richard and mekenna hope*~  the girl name is really pretty i think*~ and i like the name caleb alot*~|`|I57RLdhfaa	caleb is a brilliant name also quite like mekenna|`|79fXZ8aMaa	Caleb Richard, and I love Marina.|`|ePZi2zPGaa	Cale and Marina|`|OOYHJAcfaa	FYI Gavin and Trevor are awesome boy names|`|HDS3IGj1aa	cale richard and mekenna hope|`|IlSGU9Yzaa	Caleb is good. How about Madison for a girl?
3IQpCzEoaa	Both are pretty names, but I do not like them together. There are 4 syllables in the first and 3 in the second. Doesn't flow. Either one as a first name with a short middle name would be beautiful!|`|YMoBKBjtaa	I LOVE it!!!!!!! I love the name Arianna, and Isabelle is really beautiful with it. I think it would be great!!!! You can definitely recommend it to her, and it would be a beautiful, beautiful choice. But keep in mind that it is her daughter, and she can name her whatever she wants! You can always keep this name for your daughter. It is beautiful, though, for sure!! I hope this helped and best wishes =)|`|nQ7ZcUI3aa	I think that it is cute but sort of long, but good flow.|`|HWeajklaaa	I think it's cute, but wouldnt it be better if you used it for a future daughter of your own seeing as you love it so much?|`|KyVi3nJnaa	I like it...it's interesting without being bizarre|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I wouldn't name my kid that but I've heard worse.|`|zcSAWWCkaa	dont like it, sorry|`|Lsst29Btaa	LOVE LOVE LOVE IT! :] so beautiful.|`|0998cb727a21ddeb5105fa6704b79faaaa	it seems more of an adult name than a kid/teens name<br>  <br>  but i love the name|`|VOmE0UFsaa	Yes i like it alot*~!!
Ifk1Mgdbaa	i use spray and wash with resolve  you can get it at any store family dollar or walmart  around 3 dollars and after he poops spray it on really good and rub it in then let it set for 10-15 minutes than wash i use all landuary soap it also has a stain lefter in it|`|GMQfejxKaa	I use spray and wash, I just immediately spray the clothing and scrub it with an old toothbrush and a liitle water and sometimes I use a little detergent too, then I let it sit until I do laundry next, I've never had anything stain, not even when it sat a couple days.|`|HIRYscJlaa	I use Oxy Baby spray and let it sit on the clothes for awhile and then was them it works wonders|`|Tr7kIQPkaa	Hydrogen Peroxide! It is great on tough stains!!|`|xcxMB4Rlaa	I try to soak the garment in hot water immediately.  That works fairly well because the stain hasn't had a chance to set in yet.  I sometimes add hydrogen peroxide.  It works very well and is cheap.  Sometimes I also use a pre-wash treatment, but not always.  Then I wash using my regular detergent and a brightener.  The pre-wash treatment, detergent, and brightener are all natural products from a company called Melaleuca.  This is what works for me.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Oxyclean! Get the stain wet and rub the oxyclean right in and let it sit over night before you wash. I use it on stains in cloth diapers, surely it would work on clothes. In the future keep a bowl of water and tide set aside and soak clothes as soon as they are soiled. You can dump the water and clothes right into the washer and stains never set in.|`|h85kkDsbaa	I use vanish to get orange food stains out of my sons clothes, i spray it on right before washing and this gets all stains out, you can get it in any supermarket.<br>  <br>  Also i know that if something has blood on it if you run it under cold water straight away it comes out so maybe the same will work with diarrhea.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	The same thing happened to me last weekend.  I soaked the stain in Spray-n-Wash with Resolve added in it (the red bottle) and washed it like normal in Gain.  Although a majority of it came out in the first wash, I repeated the process and washed it again.  The second time did the trick and the stain was completely gone.  I dried it like normal.|`|paHbLR9aaa	I use Oxy Clean.  You can get it in a powder or a spray.  I find the spray works very well for smaller spots.  You just spray it on the stain, rub it in, and let it sit for 10 minutes before washing.  It works great for me!|`|ZadTQtJaaa	Oxy Clean works awesome.
8CTNzb6kaa	Gabriella rose..... My g/f said she likes that one the best on ur list .... but i like  Gabriella Alexis|`|TK1QQSeFaa	Gabriella Rose<br>  <br>  <br>  Or if you are open to change... Gabriella Isabella because it has a fun ring to it...|`|lbThMxj7aa	This is hard because Isabelle, Rose, and Alexis are all my favorite names!<br>  <br>  I have to go with Gabriella Rose.  I just love Rose as a middle name.|`|T1R6UZDOaa	Gabriella Rose|`|4Xpo2eYLaa	Gabriella Rose sounds the best. Gabriella Cecile sounds ok. The other two do not flow well at all.|`|9YyzSkXWaa	Rose|`|caWdGcvgaa	Rose!|`|dn35heZxaa	Rose sounds best.|`|SSFy8eHNaa	B|`|f79tavO3aa	B|`|Elxuvon8aa	cecile|`|gjteVB2Daa	Rose as all the others are just too much!  Keep it simple with Gabriella.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Gabriella Alexis and Gabriella Rose are my 2 fav.  Alexis cuz that's my middle name, :D and Rose cuz that's on of my fav middle names.<br>  If i had to choose one i'd chose Gabriella Rose cuz i think it flows better.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|xrJqmRFqaa	Gabriella Rose|`|fboC1N7gaa	Rose|`|CRvdmFwCaa	D|`|a43c635a9767f924cfd929c6c43f2501aa	Rose flows better with Gabriella. Isabelle ends in the same sound as Gabriella & Alexis begins with an A whereas Gabriella ends in an A. It doesn't flow together.|`|udVdQSchaa	Gabriella Rose<br>  or<br>  Gabriella Cecile<br>  <br>  x|`|mx3YK5rLaa	B. There are too many syllables in Gabriella to also have a long sounding middle name, it just flows better.|`|IU4uNH97aa	Gabriella Rose is the best.<br>  Gabriella Isabella has to much ELL for me.<br>  I dont think the others flow well.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	Gabriella Rose|`|pPBeOpgRaa	C. Sounds right and pretty and sophisticated at the same time to me ^_^|`|e7uUfLsqaa	I like ROSE the best..seems to flow better :)|`|OlEnfCo3aa	rose
c73QkZ2haa	It is possible but the only way he is going to know for sure is thru a paternity tests. If he has reason to believe he is the father he has the right to request one.<br>  <br>  My grandma has one dimple.<br>  My mom has 2.<br>  My uncle has 2.<br>  I have one. <br>  My son has 2 on one side.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps.|`|52bAHCaUaa	He needs a DNA test. <br>  <br>  Dimples are not going to tell you ANYTHING about whether he is the father or not.|`|4e67Pdfvaa	this is rediculous. the baby needs a test, dimples has NOTHING to do with paternity testing.|`|N28zLxtpaa	A dimple is simply visible indentations of the skin, caused by underlying flesh, which form on some people's cheeks when they smile. Dimples are genetically inherited and are a dominant trait.<br>  It does not mean that the child will have the same # or placement of dimples, just that they will have some or one.|`|CPPBqVaaaa	um.. dimples doesnt define the dna.... neither one of my parents has dimples but i have a slight one above my lip  and on my cheek. and soo does my baby sister..|`|AA11981363	Dimples won't say anything about paternity. A DNA test will.-|`|Ey3Bu8e7aa	Its possible. If you research on Chromisomes, you can find that if a woman had blue eyes, even after thousands of years of children with brown eyes, it is still possible for a daughter to have blue eyes, as long as they are related. I'd also suggest to wait until the baby gets older to recognize some of the details and similarities, like have her mother send photos every month. Hope that helped!|`|jIsAIwCgaa	seriously?... okay two of my 3 children have dimples and neither me or my husband has them, and yes my husband is the father of all. that was a completely ridiculous question. My neighbors baby looks like angelina jolie's baby, but we don't think Brad Pitt is the father...|`|Ifk1Mgdbaa	answer your question yes he could be the father and no he could not be the father  all you need to do is request a DNA test and you won't have to wounder anymore,  besides don't you or he want to know if this is his child|`|H3h4j4aKaa	lol i have 3 dimples and my husband has none and my son has one it's justs the luck of the draw i guess lol if you want to be sure get a paternity test|`|Snv7vTEkaa	dimples are not necessarily genetic<br>  <br>  dna test -- your brother has the right of he if really wants to know.|`|tRhI8sTNaa	First of all it's really none of your buisness I realize he is family and you care but that's between him and his ex girlfriend and just because a baby is mixed dosent mean that it will look mixed sometimes the baby comes out completley white and sometimes the baby comes out completley black and if he has any doubts then he needs to ask the mother for a paternity test. But good luck and dont give is ex a lot of heartache over it trust me it's not any good for anybody when the family from either side sticks their nose in it just causes that much more drama. and can cause some serious problems
fZGBjtpVaa	My daughter went through this stage.  I wouldn't say it's a problem as most children do it, their body clocks change.  Try putting her bed half an hour early, if she starts to wake up too early then change her bedtime again.  Give it a month or so and she'll be her usual self :)|`|O8vQ3xi4aa	I agree, it's probably just a transitional stage. If you feel very concerned just ask the pediatrician!
q4rG5Dwtaa	7 month old, 5 year old, 8 year old. What life haha. No really I love my babies so much, but all my time is devoted to them now. Once I get them all in bed I sit down and take a deep breath.  My 7 month old still gets up twice a night to eat. My 5 year old daughter is a miss priss and loves lots of attention. My 8 year old son talks so much I can't catch my head. Yesterday I had the day off with the kids for Mardi Gras, I didn't get a chance to take my shower till 10am, once I got in the shower my baby woke up from a 15 minute nap screaming from the top of his lungs, so I rushed through the shower. But its all worth it. Good Luck.|`|WPI0Z47saa	I have a 3 year old and am 23 weeks pregnant. I just wanted to say one thing. 3 years old is sooooooooooooooo much worse than 2. People told me that and I just laughed but it is so true. I am hoping 4 will be better.|`|ZadTQtJaaa	I have a newborn and a 4 year old... I've been dealing with major jealousy.  We thought we had her prepared for the babies arrival and she was excited, until the baby came home.  She's slowly getting used to the new addition.  She's our big helper when she wants to be.  Our problem is, we can't take our eyes off the baby because she will pull him, push, nudge, etc.  She's too rough, but doesn't understand that yet.  It's been crazy and quite an adjustment but it's getting better.<br>  <br>  The sleep thing... yeah.  Soon as I get the baby asleep she's ready to get up and play.|`|BzvstX7uaa	I don't have a second child yet, however, if you think he will settle down at 3, you're nuts lol =)<br>  Unless of course you are lucky and have a darling angel little boy. =)<br>  <br>  Actually, I don't even know why they call it terrible two's, its been nothing but terrible THREES for me and other mommies i know.<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck with your precious 2nd baby I'm sure everything will work out.|`|rR4q2e9qaa	My daughter was almost 3 when our son was born, and it was actually easier than I thought it would be. She was sooo good with her little brother, helped me out so well, and never complained.  (well, not very often).  Just to make sure to spend one on one time with your toddler while baby is napping!|`|nYioXmnGaa	The first thing I can tell you is TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NAP TIME !!! I love nap time ! My sons are  fourteen months and seven months. My oldest one is not that  active he  just plays in the floor  with his brother while mommy  does the dishes or something like that . Some times my  oldest wants to help and if that happens I just put my youngest in the swing or something . I find it  semi easy . If you are  going to have another boy just be aware that boys tend to be a  little more possessive of their toys and might fight with the other. So what I am trying to tell you is keep a good eye on the newborn .|`|7hTFflJ3aa	I have a three year old and a 3 month old. My toddler LOVES his baby sister and loves to help with her. He gets a little jealous sometimes, but he has never hurt her or anything. We try to inculde him as much as possible. Here are some things he does to be included- he gets the babys bottle from the warming glass and brings it to us, he holds her hand while we change daipers, he sings paty cake to her, we have him get her pacifier or blanket or whatever else. We let him "hold" the bottle (we are holding it but he thinks he is", he helps get the towels and washcolths and pjs for her bath, I let him use the wash cloth and wash her tummy and legs in the bath....<br>  There are lots of ways to include the toddlers. My best advice is to include him, not exclude him. The more you tell him he cant help, the more resentful he will be. At that age, they love to go get things and be a big helper. Also, be sure to praise praise praise him for helping and being nice to the baby!!!|`|p1sB578jaa	i have two that are 23 months apart. a 2 1/2 yo girl and 8 month old boy. she is very much in the midst of the terrible 2's. not sure what she will be like at 3. each child is different. my two love to play together. sleep deprivation will be over before you know it and then you will be faced with a new obstacle. get is much help as you can. two kids is just a lot more work than just one. i mean alot. routine will be your best friend. even if the 3's are awful. they do understand more and can be more helpful. i tell my 2yo that her baby bro loves her and thinks she's funny. herd to dislike someone that thinks such great things.|`|xvNIw9xyaa	I agree, I feel that children go through their terrible two's when they are three. It's been a trend in children that I've noticed lately. <br>  You will be tired, but you'll find a way. The first few weeks will be rough, but they'll also be the time when you have lots of help. See if your significant other can take a few weeks off of work when you have the baby. Also, I'm sure that plenty of people will be by with casseroles and other goodies. If you have parents in the area, see if they can swing by in the afternoon to help so that you can take a nap for a few hours. Family is very important at this time. <br>  Your toddler will probably be jealous of the attention of the new baby and possibly attempt to "act like a baby." Those are the two most common responses. Also, a three year old may have trouble understanding that the baby cannot be poked or squeezed and it not a toy. <br>  When your baby gets to be a few months old, you can put him/her on a schedule and have then sleep when your toddler does. The first time you should attempt to start this is around one month of age. <br>  Caffeine is helpful lol. But be prepared to be tired for a few months. Your pregnancy will leave you tired during the day as well, and you will be getting up to pee in the middle of the night near the end as well. So think of that as preparation. <br>  I'd reccommend getting a baby sling if you don't have one already. It makes it easy to run after your toddler, do the dishes, or other things that require two hands while holding/nursing the baby. <br>  Good Luck And Have Fun! These are the years that you will remember.
EHozsofQaa	First pregnancy: missionary (I got a boy.)<br>  second pregnancy: woman on top. (I got a girl.)|`|S4DNQkFraa	I wasn't trying. But, I'm sure it was either missionary or doggy style...those are the ones we used most often. Congrats and G/L!!!!!!!|`|OI3bf4yjaa	I was on top.|`|8ifHo5F3aa	hehe that sfunny..<br>  w/ me i think it was timing it not positioning...<br>  it was like a few days after my period....and later i read that s when<br>  <br>  its most likely to get pregnant...my advice is just do it often ,,,i dont think its the positioning..|`|BO28Mn8haa	umm... TMI but all 5.. which is what we usually do lol. but after he finishes, lay on the floor on your back with your feet up on the bed.. this way gravity will help the little suckers travel where they need to go! baby dust to you|`|PfLg9B6aaa	I was either on top or missionary not sure.|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	missionary but the baby wasn't planned.  I just know it was missionary because not even 30 minutes later I felt myself ovulate.  I was like oops.|`|SqYJRZaEaa	man on top, few days before periods, got pregnant and had a girl!<br>  woman on top, during ovulation, had a boy!|`|ca9dEvSAaa	lol, I wasn't trying, but this is funny I'll answer. The condom brooke during the missionary position. Number 2.|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	Getting pregnant has to do with timing NOT position. But to answer your question I'm sure I was on top....thats how we do it every time ;-)|`|8Oh1UUqvaa	I dont know but whichever it was it worked...I have a 9 month old boy!|`|AA10233637	woman on top...i had a girl....good luck
Ifk1Mgdbaa	yes look and see if yours are envoiromental ones made from recyecled material and see if it sayes frangrance you can but them different ways  i now i run in to that with my daughter to|`|H3h4j4aKaa	well im sure the outside appearance has changed and i noticed they where thinner than usual but i still buy them because i feel like they are the best but the ones i bought never had a fragrance|`|D5cOFZdwaa	Yeah i did. i recently switched back to luvs from pullups at night [get twice as many for a few dollars more].|`|2N6KEoVqaa	I use Luvs with my son and have noticed the same things, but I think it depends on where I buy them. When I went to California they didn't have the blue diamond pattern, but at home when I bought them they did. Now I can't remember if the new size he is in has it or not, but the last time I bought them was the first time I noticed the fragrance.|`|ba1de16220287f2a6ca02288c1a71636aa	I use Luvs with my son.  I love them.  I have noticed that they do have a fragrance that I can't quite place.  He is my first child so I have nothing to compare them to.
zwJbUbWMaa	No, that isn't normal. It doesn't necessarily mean that something is terribly wrong but it is something that you really need to call your doctor and get checked out immediately.|`|96HWpdkFaa	No you don't usually bleed.<br>  I'm 9 weeks and have never bled once during this pregnancy.<br>  You need to go to the doctor.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|D9ufwiMXaa	Spotting is just as common in early pregnancy as not spotting a good number of women bleed at some point in early pregnancy and go on  to have perfectly healthy pregnancies and babies.<br>  I would call your Doc ASAP though to confirm as it sounds like regular period type bleeding rather than light bleeding or spotting<br>  Good luck|`|VRALORYBaa	if this is your first pregnancy then yes it could happen with my first pregnancy i bled very heavy and got scared went to the hospital and they said your body is getting used to the pregnancy. since your hips widen and ur making room for baby. You should be fine unless u see a sack that is purpleish red then u had a miscarriage and u will be in ALOT of pain|`|H3h4j4aKaa	i really really think you should see your gyno or at least give him a call and see what he has to say i don't think that is normal but i am no doctor either|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Spotting can occur but that much blood sounds like a miscarry.  So sorry dear.  Call your Dr asap.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey darling. im not sure, It should be call them or if its close by. Go past and ask them. they wont judge you anything. they are there to help.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|DDnxY3k1aa	it should be.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Call them and ask, its takes just as long to call and ask as it does to post the question here.
0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Actually, when you are an adult, especially one who is 8 months pregnant, you are entitled to take a shower (or pretty much do or eat anything you want) any time of the day or night without owing an iota of explanation to anyone.<br>  So just say "I'm taking a shower, then I'm going to bed", and get up and go.  But you might want to avoid any thrashing or wild moaning while you're in there, or you'll give yourself away.|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Well if you can't take a shower right before bed you could get some depends.  I know it sounds horrible but I guess it's better then the alternative.  And just keep them in the bathroom.  Or try taking a "bath" earlier at night?|`|eU5Eth2aaa	This question sounds like a scene from a movie!  It has totally made my day!<br>  <br>  You could either wait until they are both asleep and "take care of business" or wear a Poise pad to bed.  You might try peeing right before you go to bed and finding some way to wake yourself up in the middle of the night so you can try and go again.<br>  <br>  OR!  You could say you have to run and get something from your car!  Just lay the seat back and like I said "take care of business!"<br>  <br>  Just make sure you leave something you need in the car so you don't return empty handed.<br>  <br>  Good luck!  Congrats on the baby!|`|aJTBF7opaa	hmmmm might have to go the depends way, sounds crazy but no one will know but you, lol and us. Or tell ur mom u have to take a shower be for bed it helps you back or something idk.|`|W6S6WpsNaa	Huh.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	I wonder if this has anything to do with the strength of your kegal muscles (the same muscle you use to stop a flow of urine)? Usually they tighten after sex/orgasm... Maybe on the nights you don't have one, your muscles are too weak to hold back the urge to urinate in your sleep? Maybe try some exercises to strengthen your kegals- these are good to do at this point anyway because these muscles will help push the baby out and help re-tighten your vagina after birth. just google "kegals" and you just get tons of info on how to do it!|`|vrHeGvy2aa	Opt for sleeping on the couch.  Tell your dad you just can't seem to get comfortable in your bed anymore.  After all, you are 8 months pregnant.  I'm sure he would understand that and let you sleep on the couch.  Otherwise, buy depends or poise pads and sleep with your mom.|`|yea2hci5aa	Strange situation. <br>  <br>  You could always explain your late night shower/bath to your parents by saying that it feels good on your back and helps you relieve stress through out the day.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|FXINmF6saa	Wow I have never heard of that. It's kind of funny but odd. It's still hard you really have to choices masturbate in the bathroom or pee in bed. I would pick masturbate in the bathroom. It is much more pleasureful, lol. Anyway what I would recommend is to do it in the tub a little earlier in the night and go to sleep early. Or you can go all night half asleep and when you feel like you have to pee or you dream you're peeing in the bathroom pinch yourself and run to the bathroom. Good Luck! Funny story by the way that will be something to share with your baby when he's allot older.
b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Well, I know this doesn't sound the greatest but the first step is to tell your parent/parents.  Or if would be easier tell your boyfriend and his parents first.  Sometimes one set of parents is easier to tell first.  Then you need to find a doctor.  You usually see a doctor around 8 weeks after the first day of your last period.<br>  <br>  Congratuations, on your unexpected gift.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	If the test was positive yep - you're pregnant.  They are rarely wrong, talk to your parent, an older sibling, aunt, or guidance counselor.  Find a doctor or clinic in your area and get some pre-natal care or decide which other option you want to take, but either way talk to someone you know or a doctor.|`|tDEiKXIQaa	Call Birthright 1-800-550-4900 They have tons of resources for you keep the baby your little one already has a heartbeat and all. you can do this. your little one is a Blessing from God . God Bless|`|LMc23g9Maa	If your stomach really hurts, you might be on your way to a miscarriage.  It's the best thing that can happen to you right now. 15 is not an age to be a mum.|`|AA10888290	talk to your parents or other trusted adult ASAP|`|MMj7YcXkaa	go to health clinic...they will give you options and keep it confidential.|`|oaQ8Tuhjaa	go to planned parent hood|`|QdFOTKs9aa	First step would be to gather your resources and get yourself to a local facility for a confirmatory pregnancy test. Here's why: your symptoms can be due to other things although a positive pregnancy test is harder to be skewed. Yet, it is not unheard of to have a false-positive pregnancy result. This is why many people suggest to take more than one test. Store bought pregnancy tests are not as reliable as a sonogram. <br>  <br>  So, go get some medical attention. Whether you are pregnant, miscarrying, symptomatic of Endometriosis, ovarian cysts, etc you need medical attention. <br>  <br>  One side note. Accept and move on to what will better yourself, and a possible child at this point, in the future. Take your days one step at a time. Remember:  "One step makes a mile."<br>  <br>  Good luck & God bless.|`|56c0d46a45f9b0690017a28ae0651b65aa	well first  you have to talk to your mother or any female adult that you trust. Then you have to go to the dr or health department to get a test there. They have all kinds of help there and they will talk to you about what to do. I know I was 15 when i got pregnant with my son and it was very hard. I was sooooooo scared. My mom was wonderful and so was my dad they didnt flip out they just helped me keep him he is 29 now and he is a great Guy. Parents can surprise you. If you choose not to keep a baby there are many parents out there that would love to adopt a baby. Im sure things will turn out ok.|`|7XBoIgd6aa	You have many options, you can be a mother to a baby that is being raised by some one else, you can be a mother to a baby that is being raised by you or you can be a mother to a dead baby. Either way you are a mother now. You need to get to the doctor and talk to some one you trust and/or your parents first either way your parents will need to know.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	Here's a few things NOT to do.<br>  <br>  Don't get an abortion, then think that's a plausible solution to using birth control.<br>  Learn something and use birth control each sexual encounter unless you want a child.<br>  Don't allow your parents to raise the child. I was a teen mother and I can not even fathom why someone would do this. I see it so often though; Mommy still goes out clubbing and her parents do it all.<br>  Do what's best for baby. Be honest with yourself.<br>  And most importantly, take top notch care of yourself and your baby. Don't go out drinking and all that BS. Time to grow up.|`|AqmJ4vPwaa	dont freak out, go to the Dr. and talk to your parents!  it may seem really bad now, but with the right support, it will pull itself together|`|MJSvmzxYaa	tell your parents. go to a pregnancy crisis center. DONT GET AN ABORTION|`|gsJLU82waa	well take one more test if it postive then go to health dept. just calm down  u will live thru it|`|j6Et71OHaa	Be calm, everything will be okay I just turned 17 and im 35 weeks pregnant.. I know your scared but before you freak out you need to see a doctor to confirm it.. Your stomach shouldnt hurt, Its probably just stress but that stress can make you lose your baby.. talk to your parents, if you want to keep the baby and you think they will make you give it up you should wait a while before telling them... until you start to show.. But its best just to tell them so you can get medical attention. you need prenatal vitamins, and a check-up ASAP..|`|uexS1cXgaa	Sweety,truthful everything happens for a reason. so maybe its time for you to be a mommy. umIf your friends with your mom tell her shell know what to do. After all she raised you honey.
Ff7mCzlPaa	I think your weight is good.<br>  <br>  If you are concerned about the tummy, you can do abdominal exercises... walking is good too.<br>  <br>  take care !<br>  <br>  by the way, it's nice to look your best but if a guy won't date you for superficial reasons, he's a jerk.|`|KcwF3yhLaa	Your bmi is 24.3.<br>  That is vary good. :) :)|`|0unqJPehaa	I don't think your overweight, but no matter what, be happy with your body, don't let anyone tell you otherwise.  Just be happy your not one of those sickly anorexic looking girls that seem to be all over now.<br>  <br>  Also, look at old medical books, you will see that girls have some tummy, it's not perfectly flat, it's normal for girls to have some tummy. Just today's world is just vain and shallow and made unrealistic views of how women should look.|`|BO77Jnxqaa	you are perfect|`|GSASXDyBaa	nope. you sound just fine the way you are. no worries! :)|`|mbbBfKTtaa	no way i would f*ck u right now|`|fruO1G62aa	i think you should start think about like more working out like running or stuff and it depends on your age! because if your still growing its ok to be overweight
Od73sfkxaa	My periods were always considered irregular, but they don't seem as irregular as yours. Try having sex the whole month to get pregnant. Like once every other day or once every two days. Try to keep sperm in you the whole time, reason being is it possible to miss your ovulation day (you might accidently miss calculate and have it later than expected, or sooner than expected). Irregular periods can be a pain and hard to predict.<br>  <br>  Also, look up a conception calculator. You put in the first day of your last period and it roughly calculates when you ovulate. Even though you are irregular it is still nice to have an idea of when you might ovulate.<br>  <br>  Another good idea is to keep track of when your periods were, when you had sex, and your estimated ovulation date. I have a paper that I write everything down just because I am forgetful. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps & I wish you the best of luck =)|`|Azp6bBazaa	have you tried the basal thermometer method??<br>  its pretty simple only consists of taking your temp every morning at the same time, once it gets higher that means you ovulated. <br>  <br>  idk any other since you menstration isnt reuglar. <br>  and have you seen an obgyn yet?? they can help out alot.
XmJZkFuMaa	My doctors suggested lacto-free type formulas.  I know Enfamil makes a lacto-free (gentle-ease is 1/4 of the normal amount of lactose.)  I'm sure other brands do as well.  They basically said that brands typically are brands.  I would be careful going from one to the other though since you are supposed to mix them, and there's still that uncertainty about the melamine contaminations where if you mix contaminated Enfamil with contaminated Similac it could cause stones almost immediately.  So you want to stay within the brand once you start a brand if at all possible for now.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	ask your doc what he would suggest you use if you stop breastfeeding and go from there; don't switch without talking to the doc; it can take up to a week for them to adjust, so gas, fussiness, diarrhea can all come on from  a new formula, so you have to give each one a chance once they have gotten used to it.....|`|pXSKSS3daa	Formula is a trial and error process. You won't know until you've tried one to see if it works. I think we went through three brands before finding one that seemed to work better with our son.|`|XTuhGaL1aa	Well what I did was I went with what the hospital recommended. Nestle Good Start with Omega 3 and 6. It was also recommended by my paediatrician. <br>  <br>  Most people have to try several formula's before they find which one agrees with their baby because all babies are different. <br>  <br>  We went from Nestle Good Start to Enfamil A+ Thickened (reflux) to Enfamil Gentlease (colic and gas). Enfamil Gentlease is much easier on the digestive system which is perfect for babies that are colic like my daughter was.|`|vsFJZRkGaa	try the cheapest and most available formula first and go from there.<br>  <br>  we choose S26 original for newborns as it's cheap, you can buy it anywhere and it's the tin the hospital recommended. He hasn't had any trouble with it.<br>  <br>  we tried the Gold version (+ omega 3) out of peer pressure from other mums telling me he needs that omega 3.... he was very ill, consipated, vomiting, not sleeping, colic-like symptomns, pains... so we switched back and had our happy bouncy boy back in 3 days!! man, we felt like it was such a blessing to have him happy again.<br>  <br>  its all trial and error.|`|397b528338dbd9036ae6de0f84b8f817aa	formula is formula, they are all pretty much the same. most people i know just use the kind that WIC gives them

4y3J1tfbaa	Your best advice would be to either go through a Family Law attorney or go through an adoption agency. Either way,you will need to probably get homestudied etc etc before this could happen.Homestudies vary from agency to agency.
ENANtueuaa	It IS a phase..it's called "terrible two's." My daughter went through this from 18 months, until she was 2 1/2. She threw tantrums just like what you are experiencing with your son, so you're definately not alone! The best thing to do is walk away, and ignore them. If they get too out of hand, calmly pick him up and put him on his bed. Never give into the tantrum, because it will only teach him that when he wants something, all he has to do is throw a tantrum and he'll get it. Remember to be consistant!|`|AFi5kTiEaa	At 2 my daughter did the same thing, it is a phase.  She would just scream, cry and fall to the ground and there was no consoling her.  I learned the best way to handle it was to ignore it for as long as possible.  When it had gone of for...long enough.  I would sit near her,like on the couch if she was on the floor and just look at her.  She would look at me, i would say would you like a hug.  She would usually stop and come over, I would never go to her.  If she wasnt ready I would just walk away. The tantrums got less and less and they have stopped all together.  It is a phase, ignore it for the most part but do console him when it is over.  I dont think my daughter remembered why she was angry in the first place so i didnt talk about it after unless it was something worth mentioning.|`|ttZ9BOypaa	When things like this are happening, there's usually a good reason. I know with my son and everyone I know it means the kid is either not getting enough sleep or not getting enough food during the day. Look at these first. I do NOT suggest giving in to tantrums, but you need to find the cause. If you can't find a reason and it really is a constant thing that seems to have no triggers, it never hurts to ask the doctor. It could be an ear infection or something. You just never know. Most kids don't throw random tantrums without there being some underlying reason. Good luck!|`|AA10529334	Well it is a phase. Best advice i can give you is to ignor tantrums. Just walk away and ignor him completely until he stops having the tantrum. Then go on as if it never happened. It may take a while but he will eventually figure out it isnt working and stop.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	o, there is a reason.<br>  <br>  its called attention!!!<br>  <br>  when he does this- IGNORE IT. no matter what. he will eventually stop all together.|`|5OJ5WUUdaa	Every kid goes threw this<br>  <br>  Duh<br>  <br>  Terrible Twos
vOFdHvlvaa	Yea it sounds like it has bulti up in his system and he is just now gettin a reaction from it, that could def. be what happened, that happens to some babies and people who are other slightly allergic to stuff (it takes awhile to get the allergic reaction, but it will eventually come).  I would def. switch his formula and see how that goes for a couple of weeks.  Good luck and i hope this helps, :D.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	i would say if it were an allergic reaction the doc would have said so, they are pretty easy to spot for a med pro....i wouldn't change it without talking to doc first and if he/she agrees, i would go with what they recommend you change to; it can take babies tummies a week or so to adjust to a new formula, they may have a lot of gas, diarrhea, etc...so if you don't need to change it don't; it is possible to develop an allergy after four weeks, but unlikely.....what type of bottles do you use? they can contribute to the extra burps, colic, wind, etc.....you need vented bottles or some kind that doesn't allow bubbles back up through the nipples if you don't have that kind; i suggest and highly recommend playtex ventaire advanced; they work great, angled neck, air enters the bottom of the bottle so no air or bubble in formula; some ppl say that they leak, if you put them together correctly, they NEVER leak....we used them exclusively for 8 mos and once we figured out how to put them together, we have not had one leak; if you need instructions on them for any reason email me..|`|Lprtz2A9aa	If you think it's the formula change it. They are plenty of brands and I had to try 3 different ones before I found one my son could take. He got really bad gas and burps, until I found one he didn't get that reaction with. Just slowly work him into the new brand.|`|M7f0QmyLaa	you should bring that up with your next doctor visit.  your child is too young for you to change or experiment with his formula.|`|AA10888290	it's baby acne.  it peaks around 8 weeks and clears up on its own.  don't change anything.
tCNG36OMaa	There should be a balance.   A lack  or too much of  both sides are not good.  Being a good role model, and guiding a child is an every day job that requires a lots of love, patience, energy, dedication and knowledge. A child development is  influenced by the way  his parents are involved in their lives.|`|iMULlxdgaa	I like Lizzie's answer..but I'd also have to note that from personal experience its what you got inside of your own spirit (really ahrd to explain) but its the same thing that makes some people break down and others just survive.  Might be genetics or might be that certain people just got something in them.  But I would say I am not an authoritative parent,  but also not permissive, I treat my child with respect and I talk to him about things that are going on so he stays informed and he is so bright and smart for me doing that with him.  I love him so much!  If he needs a ***-kicking I will give him one (don't get me worng),  but mostly he never does because he's my super cool little guy!  I'm so proud of him!|`|LMc23g9Maa	In a nutshell, I think authoritarian parenting makes anxious and fearful children and permissive makes for bratty kids.|`|xNjtfXcuaa	I believe I read that genetics influence 30-50% of a child's development, the rest is a mix between cultural, parents and peer influence.|`|sfE8mgJ3aa	bihomora.ws

PwhrTNZraa	Maybe try starting her routine earlier and get her to bed earlier.  My daughter (3 1/2) usually comes to me around 7pm telling me she's tired and ready for bed.  We have always had the same routine, and bed time is within a 1/2 hour of the same time EVERY night (between 7-7:30)  She wakes on her own usually between 6-7am and has no naps.  If your daughter is still napping, maybe it's time to try and skip the naps.  She's just trying out a new game with you, you just have to be patient, consistent and firm.|`|PrxlHUT5aa	well for one don't wake her up... if she's sleeping, let her sleep... that way if she goes to bed early or late at 11pm then she's still completing her quota.  also those who miss their naps are more likely to miss their early bedtime.  did you say play and color :o) that is exactly why she's up...kids this age think they WILL BE missing out on something if they get some shut eye.  assure her there's always tomorrow and be firm in sticking to your rules.|`|AFi5kTiEaa	If she is still taking a nap, you might need to cut it out.  This happend with my daughter and when we stopped her naps it stopped.  Never let her get out of bed or she will know she can so she will play the games.  I did it and it was a nightmare to make her stay in bed.|`|AA10529334	Try turning off all the lights in the house and go into your room as if you are going to bed. It might be she thinks shes gonna miss something - but if  you are going to bed theres nothing to see or do.|`|LvThe1Hcaa	Try a simple trick.  Let her stay up.  Tell her she can.  So she will.  Sooner or later she will get really tired and Grumpy and feel sick.  Then she'll understand why she needs to sleep when she does.|`|8wGCUSxZaa	Honestly, she is probably doing this because she knows that it will buy her a few more minutes out of bed.  I would let her scream, cry, and kick.  If she gets out of her room, put her back in her bed and tell her that it is time to go to sleep, you love her and will see her in the morning; goodnight.  Then walk out.  Continue this until she goes to sleep.  Once she realizes that her tantrum will not get her what she wants, she should get back to her normal routine.<br>  <br>  Also, you might want to try putting her to bed a little earlier.  I know that sounds counter intuitive.  However, most kids have a harder time falling asleep if they are overtired.  Most kids this age that I know are in bed by 8 pm.  My daughter goes to bed at 7:30.<br>  <br>  Good luck.  Toddler tantrums are rough.
ztzEloj5aa	take a test<br>  its the most annoying answer- yes i know<br>  i know your looking for experiences from other women but you will not get that here- all your going to get is the answer- take a test- sorry but its true- people dont want to share their experiences- they only want to tell you take a test- its sad- why ask the question if that is the answer you are going to get?<br>  people on here cant and wont help you out except give you the most obvious answer.<br>  <br>  I will however give you my experience- this happened to me last month as well- sex before period- and an early short period- mine was 2 days - i useually have it for about 4-5 i took a test a week later but it was neg. - I then just waited till the next expected period - which i happened to get today :(|`|PRaTLk8laa	ok...usually you can not get pregnant by having sex right before your period.  You get pregnant when you ovulate.  Do some research on ovulation to figure out when you ovulate, then plan from there.  Shorter periods could mean a number of different things.  You usually do not get your period if you are pregnant (USUALLY).|`|GWveqx61aa	well the day b4 your period, not preg, maybe if you had sex 2 weeks ago, than this could be implantation bleedig, by now if you are preg a test should say so, dollar store tests are pretty good, good luck and baby dust to us all|`|umdKUxSDaa	sometimes having sex right before your period can stop your period not meaning your pregnant.|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	Good luck.  You're best chance to concieve is when you're ovulating.  Usually you ovulate 2 weeks after the first day of your cycle.|`|9riZoniOaa	No it doesn't mean your pregnant. Your body doesn't react that quickly. Sometimes you can "trick" your body into thinking your pregnant and you get the symptoms but your still not pregnant. Why don't you just calculate the days your fertile. Anyways you need to wait at least three weeks after your missed period to take a pregnancy test.|`|ZtDrwELIaa	that happened to me in october and i was so sure i was preggers i took like 3 tests and they were neg and i didnt believe it but it turned out i just had a really crazy period :( <br>  good luck! im still trying :(|`|YN0Bs8pRaa	If you also had sex at other times in the month its possible...... do a home pregnancy test kit and it will tell you.|`|7363ab2513dbf5e0049fab2868e5d17faa	are you stressed out? if your stressed it will mess up the period.. best of luck.
ev0SHwMyaa	I used fertilaid for 6 weeks and became pregnant after almost 3 years of trying. I did have irregular periods and it regulated me in the first month of taking it and then 2 weeks later I was pregnant. I can't say for sure that it was the fertilaid or just coincidence but it seemed to have worked for me. Good luck to you and much baby dust***|`|oiJITSNZaa	Fertilaid is a very inexpensive natural supplement. and not only is it good to boost your conceiving system it makes a good prenatal formula before you conceive, so what can you lose? Fertilaid.com has very goood prices.<br>  Sorry to disagree with Nicole but two months is not enough time to get fertilaid into your system and regulate it the way it should. 6 months of taking this formula with FertilCM is the recommended minimum. TTC is a patience testing process.|`|GWveqx61aa	idk how much it costs, but soy iso flavoes is about 4 dollars and vitex is about 8 dollars, you should try tose if this seems more affordable, i have heard alot of success with this combo, have questions on how to use it im me,good luck and baby dust to us all|`|TXsEZPBMaa	I bought it and used it for 2 months and also drank the fertilaid tea, and it didn't help me with anything..I probably wouldn't waste my money if i were you

I tried the off brands, like Toys 'R Us and didn't think they were as good, even though I later found out that TRU diapers were made by the people who give you Huggies. I also learned that the reactions my kids had to each brand were because of the perfumes used to cover up the smell of the wood pulp and cellouse in the diapers (call a company enough times and eventually you get an answer).<br>  <br>  And back in those days, Luvs were considered to be the premium brand.|`|698b3b0b5ebf7083a923b4bde2eb3921aa	It has been a while since i bought diapers but when I was buying them huggies was horrible, so was white cloud. We bought the generic brand when our babies were small and when they started really getting messy we got Pampers. They are more expensive but worth it. There was little to no leakage. Especially overnight|`|PeoOb4aHaa	Yuck.  I use cloth because I can't stand the smell of either.<br>  <br>  You'll just have to see which brand works best on your baby.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	I could only use huggies because they did not smell.

X9RoKfWPaa	By the sounds of it yes you very well could be if you look up the symptoms that women have when they have become pregnate. They are basically the same as what you are discribing my advice for you is to tell the potiental father and get a pregnancy test then go to the doctor and plan parenthood so that you can get all the help you need|`|GxlkhRfoaa	Yup sounds like you could def be pregnant.  Unprotected sex is how that happens.  Take a test your way far enough along for it to show up now.

I was very emotional too..|`|34ba3657ee0875c0cc3e1040d3ba9c76aa	Unprotected sex + two weeks late + these symptoms you mentioned --> there is a very HIGH chance you are pregnant! If you take a pregnancy test at home, you'llbe able to know if you are by now. I took one when I was 4 days late...and it showed the correct result. If I were you I'd take a test now and if you are pregnant indeed, go see your doctor. <br>  <br>  All the best!|`|dq9uclgpaa	Yes you can be. Go to the doctor or take an HPT test. Good luck|`|PfLg9B6aaa	YES!!!!!!!! UNPROTECTED MEANS BABY MAYBE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|0dd7cabdea5b9d991d838d3e770488a1aa	Yes!  That is how people get pregnant!|`|R1eten5Haa	Yes. The local health department can give you a free pregnancy test, and they can also issue you what is called a Proof of Pregnancy form that you can take to the Department of Family and Children Services to apply for RSM Medicaid. PLEASE think twice about abortion. Plain and simple, it is murder. If you find that you don't want to keep the baby, at least consider adoption. It is no expense to you, and you can even choose the Open Adoption option so that you can have the choice of staying in contact with your child and the adoptive parents. Here is a link with more adoption information: <a href="http://www.adoptionnetwork.com/birthmother-unplanned-pregnancy/unplanned-pregnancy.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adoptionnetwork.com/birthmoth...</a> <br>  Keeping the baby and raising a child will be tough, but it will be so worth it in the end! It will require a lot of growing up and a lot of responsibility, but it will be worth it. The state will make the father be responsible, as well, if he chooses not to do the right thing and make a family with you.

I wouldn't worry about and just enjoy the extra time!|`|yrBSkJKGaa	Infants need about 16 hours of sleep per day.  This is not a myth.  Be thankful that she is sleeping through the night.  I have a 6 and 3 yr old.  They are both in bed by 7pm and awake at 7am.  They get a good night's sleep, and my wife and I get the evenings to ourselves.  Life is good!|`|O8vQ3xi4aa	I'd say she's fine. My middle son has always treasured his sleep:) He goes to bed around 8:00 or 8:30 and sleeps till about that time in the A.M. Then he will go down for a nap around 12:30ish and sleep 2-3 hours! He actually gets his blankie and paci, and goes to his bed and tells me when he's ready! He is 2 by the way! However my 4 year old is nowhere near the same! LOL! Every child is different and I would say you're gut instinct is right on;)|`|l6LUNx9yaa	The average child under the age of 5 requires up to 14 hours a night of sleep. This doesn't include the two hour nap that most children need. This is when they are growing and changing the most in their physical development.  Being tired is quite normal, and sleeping in should be expected.  The added sleep not only helps her to regenerate blood cells quicker, but also every other cell in her body including the bone matter.  Growing up can be very painful to children as their body's stretch and make room for the height changes.  Children tend to sleep through all of this as it is more comfortable. A child who won't sleep much during these developmental stages tend to cry more, be cranky or act out because of it. <br>  <br>  If your worried about your daughter sleeping too much, you always have the option of taking her to your pediatrician for a check up just in case. There are other causes, if not natural, that can cause sleepiness. Anemia or other blood disorders are among them. If she seems tired or out of it even after sleeping through the night or taking naps, if she bruises easily, is pale, or complains of muscle aches you probably should have her checked out just as a fail safe. It's better to be safe than sorry in every case, and doctors will agree.  <br>  <br>  As a child, I slept quite often and cried a lot while I was awake. My mother realized this wasnt normal, and took me in. Turns out I was severely anemic and had been born that way but it wasn't caught at the time.  <br>  <br>  Even if it is for your own piece of mind, have a check up done with a blood pannel. If it all comes back normal, chalk it up to normal growth phases. <br>  <br>  I wish you and yours all the best.
GWveqx61aa	wow twice a year, you should talk to your dr, provera and clomid brought me to a 31 day cycle after being irregular, i wasnt as bad as you though, but for a months worth these pills are about 15 dollars, and they increase your chances too, but about taking a test, gee sorry i cant help you there, but the dollar store does sell tests so id  go buy a few and take once a week,good luck and baby dust to us all|`|WIEPISyeaa	You should wait at least two weeks to test.  But if you are that irregular, you should really talk to your doctor about provera or clomid to help regulate your cycle.  If you only have periods twice a year that means you only have a chance of concieving 2x a year.  You should REALLY talk to a doctor.  I have irregular cycles too.  It's REALLLLLLLYYYYYY tough!|`|0X7v9rdFaa	i would wait 14 days after having sex|`|XyC9YiuSaa	YOU SHOULD GO CHECK YOURSELF WITH YOUR DOCTOR BECAUSE IF YOUR IRREGULAR IN YOUR PERIODS ITS HARD TO KNOW IF YOUR PREAGNANT OR NOT IM IRREGULAR TO I I ALSO GET MY PERIOD 2 TO 3 TIMES A YEAR. YOU COULD BEGIN GETTING YOUR PERIOD REGULAR IF YOU TAKE BIRTH CONTROL PILLS THEY HELP YOU REGULATE YOUR PERIOD.|`|0upnZ6hSaa	At least 2 weeks.  R u sure u r ovulating though?
RPoFBenJaa	Im just going to say that I had a miscarriage also at 8 weeks and I was bleeding for two weeks after that. Once tghe bleeding stopped my husband and I continued having sex without protection because we figured "if its meant to be it will be" and behold two weeks after that I was preggo. We had sex every day twice a day and the doc said that helped in conceiving because i never had the opportunity to miss my ovulation time. So sex it up a notch and try to make a babe. Try to do it two times a day in the morning/afternoon and before bed. And, if you keep it in your head that its taboo to try again so early that will make the sex better . Just being honest, this all helped us alot. GOOD LUCK!!!!|`|428a2b704623f75c732936e8e018215daa	It is obviously tougher to be intentional with an inconsistent cycle but the general rule is 14 days after the first day of your last period so trying on the 13th and 15th day or 12th and 14th could increase the odds.  In this particular instance, the 5th through the 8th of March, in theory.  Also, taking you own temperature around that time and trying when your temperature shows an increase.  Good luck!|`|xwZKouCIaa	Since your period is ending today you should have sex every other day from now until 10 days from now, so thats until march 6 because typically your most fertile days are from the 1st day of your period until 12 days after so have fun and try not to worry about it too much... have sex every other day and try to get up and move around too much after sex, cause u kno "gravity" will interfere.. well good luck and lots and lots of baby dust to you!!!|`|GWveqx61aa	not knowing if this is going to be a regular period, id chart cm, thats the only true way to see if you have a sperm friendly enviroment, sorry for your loss i had a mc at 8 weeks as well, they told me to try again after my first reg period, it went back to reg immediately, id talk to your dr about the irregularity,good luck and baby dust to us all|`|1NEbsemjaa	I've done a little research on that myself and  it would be about 12-16 after the first day of your last menstual period. that's what me and my husband did this month and I hope it worked. my period is due to start in 6 days.... I have a few minor symptoms of pregnancy already including swollen and sore breast.... nausea... and headaches.<br>  <br>  also, if you just had a miscairage it should be easier for you to concieve again... that one I'm not sure about though... Its just something I heard.<br>  <br>  good luck to you and me and everyone else who is trying so desperately to concieve.|`|s8VY7uReaa	sorry about your loss hun. normally you will ovulate between 12-14 days after your last menstruation. But while you can keep enjoying everyday...never know you might conceive right away ;)<br>  Baby dust to you...i hope to hear some good news soon. keep us informed|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Maybe try an ovulation predictor kit to get a better grasp on when u r ovulating.  SO sorry about your loss btw|`|vigFmfLmaa	The best time is a day on either side of ovulation and of course the day of ovulation.  The tricky part is knowing when you ovulate though!  I've found the easiest thing to do is ovulation predictor kits.  You can buy the test strips super cheap online and always have plenty on hand.  Temping never worked for me b/c I have irregular periods and all my doctors said it was a waste of time.  Some women can actually feel when they ovulate.  I can sometimes but not every cycle.  It's a big pinch just left or right of your midline.  It's normal to take 2-4 months after a miscarriage to get back on track.  I wish you the best!|`|bQisGgSsaa	In the Summer or Spring.
lijNJznEaa	What's i.e.d anyhoo?
vigFmfLmaa	LOL that cracked me up, the way you asked that.  Did you go to a fertility clinic or to a urologist?  My husband went to a urologist the first 2 times and omg what a nightmare.  The first time he couldn't even do it, the 2nd time we brought a sample from home.  Everytime thereafter we've had samples processed at our fertility clinic.  They are much much more concerned about your humility and privacy.  Honestly I don't remember what volume is normal - your clinic should have told you though.  But I can tell you that even at the nicer more comfortable place he never produced as much as he does normally at home but the amount was always adequate.  Trust me, all guys doing what you're doing feel about the same way.  I've seen the dying-to-bolt-out-the-door faces in the waiting room many times!|`|AA11116434	Your doctor/fertility clinic will know. Sperm count is not necessarily related to the amount of ejaculate. There could be millions in a tiny amount, or no viable swimmers at all in a larger quantity. <br>  <br>  You're not the first, and you won't be the last. You can also get reliable kits online and do this in the privacy of your own home, and kind of get your answers and gear up for having the discussion with your doctor.|`|GWveqx61aa	amount varies, me and hubby are trying and i read if you want to increase your sperm volume take zinc and selenium.

kjgonYlgaa	No unless you're using the absorb-ant training pants.  Otherwise your kid will end up feeling like a goldfish.<br>  <br>  Plastic pants are to be worn over cloth diapers or heavy training pants.  I would only choose to put them on if the child was going out,  to reduce the likeliness of wetting cloths.  If they are worn all of the time no air gets to the child's skin, which in turn causes rash.  You can test them by getting a pair and using them them way they were meant to be used .  Which is not a whole lot any more.  They're kind of old school and we've advanced in the diaper area.  Try some pull ups or just keep a couple disposables on hand for the time you go out.  I guess my answer is simply No you can not use them by themselves, of course they will leak.  The child will move or bend and you will get a big gush of pee right in your lap!|`|AA10529334	noooo it will cause severe diaper rash

QP1ZQqPfaa	I have two daughters and I a 22 years old, been with my husband 6 years. So to me being pregnant is a wonderful feeling.  God blesses us with the chance to carry a child and feel them grow and move inside of us.  I loved every minute of being pregnant.  It messed up my body a lot especial after my second one.  Stretch marks a few extra pounds. As to being a mom it is a little of every feeling, wonderful, stressful, joy, anger, love everything they blow you away with all the amazing things they come up with.  It is very stress full it is all about them now.  I haven't gone to any clubs since well I can't remember.  I celebrated my 19, 20, 21, 22 at home with my daughter and husband.  I watched moves with my daughter and went to sleep early.  It's a lot different you have to give up a lot and well Its amazing too.  You will learn a lot from them, there will be so many KODAK moments.  And you will learn to LOVE. I had them both vaginal with No epidural.  It hurt A LOT, the pain is unexplainable.  I recorded both the births, but like I said very painful.  There is a epidural i heard it is wonderful and there is no pain. So Good luck!|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Horrible.  I have been so sick.  If I didn't have a job where I could just lay on the couch most of the day and vomit all the time I would have ended up on disability.  I dreaded everyday getting up in the morning for the first 6 months of pregnancy because I was tired of being so sick.  I had a pic line put in my arm and had to give myself fluids through that every evening, which made me unable to sleep because I got up about every 30-45 minutes to use the bathroom.  <br>  <br>  My husband was so sick of me being sick that he thought it was a terrible experience and no fun.  (I guess he was looking forward to all the sex and planning for the baby)  <br>  <br>  I didn't get to do any of that shopping and stuff until I was bigger and it hurt to walk.  <br>  <br>  Doesn't mean it will happen to you.  My family has a family history of really bad morning sickness.|`|ca9dEvSAaa	Well, just drink LOTS of water! lol I learned the hard way with a terrible Kidney infection. Please drink that water when pregnant. 4 water bottles a day. The pain is terrible<br>  <br>  Trimester 1 = tired, sick, ance, and no energy<br>  Trimester 2 = energy boost, ance, and feeling good <br>  Trimester 3 = tired again, huge, acne, and discomfort.<br>  <br>  Overall it isn't aweful, but I really want to have her now. I'm so over pregnancy at 38 weeks pregnant.|`|soYU9Tk6aa	you seem very mature<br>  hun get married first and let it just happen<br>  i have never given birth, but you seem to be in a stable relationship and i wish you so much luck sweetie<br>  !!!|`|AA10888290	My pregnancy was miserable.  The only good part was feeling her kick.  Being a mom is the best and HARDEST job ever.  It's a 24/7 job not for the faint hearted.  You are very smart to wait :)|`|SqYJRZaEaa	Having a baby is the best thing in the world, it changes who you are, it brings out who you are, things you never knew about yourself, the strength, the patience, the ability to love sooooooooo much... and so on... However, pregnancy is hard and long, it was for me at least, and you feel like your body does not belong to you. But if you are lucky to be with the right person, he will treat you like a queen, and do everything for you and be there for you, and you get attention from everyone, hopefully you like that... and also you feel you baby move and eat and burp inside of you, that is also really exciting! <br>  My best wishes to both of you, and I hope that your life really turnes out like you dream!|`|vFZq7522aa	There is nothing better in the world than being pregnant!! knowing that one day you will give birth and be able to raise that lovely child!! I I could I would have a million more!! I want at least 7!! <br>  It is not easy being pregnant!! But it is so worth it when the little babe gets here!! You will be tired and very ready to get it out of you but you have to remember that you will never have the same experience twice!! <br>  I hope that you choose to have a ton of kids! I remember that when I had my first I tried to go without an epedural!! But I didn't last very long!!! But I suggest to try at least once!! it is great knowing that you had the baby the natural way!! Good luck and have as many as you can!!|`|2Pp2cDbJaa	ITS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! IM NEVER DOING THIS AGAIN! = ^(<br>  I have horrible morning sickness, my back hurts, i have horrible acne all over my body....pregnancy glow? pregnancy glow my a s s =(<br>  my boobs hurt, i spend most of my time in the bathroom or in the hospital because im dehydrated a lot, an i can never stop eating, im always hungry i look like a pig. lol i hate the doctor apointmets too, i  sit for hours and hours waiting and then i get in and it only takes 5 minutes and im out the door. Not to mention the mood swings they are horrible, but i like the ultrasounds seeing my babys heart beat and its little hands and legs moving around =)

BmKCetnQaa	Really, you can just stop -- just take the sippy cup away.  She'll be upset for awhile, but the earlier you break the habit, the better, she'll just forget about it.  My daughter had a juice sippy cup she tried to keep with her all the time, and after a while of having her try regular plastic cups (which she loved because they were "big girl cups") some of the time, we just put the sippy cups away.  Then if she woke up thirsty, she'd have to get up and grab a cup of water from the dresser.<br>  <br>  By the way, kids shouldn't have milk or juice (or anything but water) in bed with them while they sleep.  It'll rot their teeth out and damage their gums.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	Yeah you should switch to water. Not only to help break her sippy cup habbit, but because drinking milk in bed at night will rot her teeth. I suggest buying her a cute "special big girl cup" and suprize her with it one day at breakfast. Maybe get a few with fun patterns on them. Make a big deal about her special cups at meal time and sooner or later she will prefer to use her special big girl cups all the time and forget about the sippy cup|`|0ky4TktEaa	For one thing she may not even be ready to potty train. Kids who are ready to potty train should be able to hold it for at least 2 hours and show signs of interest in going on the potty. Stop giving her liquids before bedtime and see if she can stay dry; is she able to do it during the day as well? If not, she's not ready, as she'll just continue to wet herself even if she'll go potty when you send her, since she doesn't have control of those muscles yet.<br>  <br>  As for the sippy cup routine, stop doing it right before bed. About 30 minutes before, give her the last drink for the night. It doesn't have to be milk or water for that matter, or it can be. As long as she's done with it 30-45 minutes before. That should give her enough time to go and you can change her right before tucking her in.|`|q1y7kgnEaa	the best thing i found was....out of sight, out of mind.....we told our kids they could keep them until they lost them, and once they lost them, they would no longer get one.....with my 2 middle children, i waited until they werent looking and i hid the sippy in a really really good hiding spot, through the day i would give them big kid cups, and at night they would ask for their sippy and i would tell them i didnt know where it was, i would let them look for it for a few minutes and then i would say, 'oopps looks like u lost it, i guess u dont get it anymore" "maybe if u find it tomorrow, u can have it back" and eventually after like a week, they didnt want the sippy anymore, they wanted to be a big kid....with my oldest, i didnt actually have to take it cause she really lost hers, but with the other 2, they held onto them darn things always, i had to have dad distract them so i could hide them,lol...may not sound right but it worked perfectly...did the same with the binkys....|`|cW6YgnB7aa	I agree with both the first two answers. It does sound like she is too young to start potty training and if she isn't quite ready it will be frustrating for the both of you. I would also switch to water so it's not so bad on her teeth. We still let our 3 year old take his sippy to bed (with water only) up until about a month ago. He has been potty trained for over 6 months and the only reason why we took it away was because we got tired of him getting up in the middle of the night to use the bathroom...he would only use the bathroom in our room at night and then he would try to sneek into our bed. <br>  <br>  Just to forwarn you, it might be a rough couple of days or a week (depending on your daughter) if you decide to switch to water since she is so used to having milk. Hope things work out for you.|`|88YAUVU4aa	It dose not sound like your little one is ready to give it up. I would not push her to do anything that would bother her sleeping pattern. She will let it go when she is ready it's her safety. Be patient.|`|c51o7yqtaa	Well, if she was potty trained you could give her a cup of milk say on the couch before bed, then have her pee and brush her teeth. . . <br>  Since she's not, I don't know. I do know that having milk or juice before bed and not brushing can damage teeth. Other than just taking it away and saying no to her, I'm out of ideas. I don't think she should be getting the idea that water isn't good though, water is important.<br>  Good Luck

In other words, your womb needs to fill up with blood again.  So, you can't be pregnant now.  But don't take chances have him wear a good quality condom each time.  The condom should be put on him when he is erect and not too tightly.  Have him pull out immediately after he ejaculates even with the condom on.|`|61ebba36da248cf6671da7f0e3c2c647aa	There is a chance that you could be pregnant but what you should do is go to your local pharmacy or planned parenthood and ask for the morning after pill (plan b, emergency contraceptive). the sooner you take it the more affective it will be.|`|9OVm1hL0aa	You have 72 hours to take the Plan B pill.  So you're a little late.<br>  Shouldn't be having sex if you don't want a baby.<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT TO THE LADY BELOW "ME":<br>  The Good Lord you're referring to, also tells us to wait till marriage.  I'm not judging, just stating the truth.|`|OhAG2Gsyaa	The morning after pill is not a mini abortion it delays or prevents the egg from implanting in the uterus. And emergency contraceptive is more or less a high dose of birth control in a safe form.|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	Go get the morning after pill!!!! NOW there are 24h pharmacies every where....however im not sure if its too late now. Please if you think you are responsible enough to have sex you need to be responsible enough to be on birth control!!!!!|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Kinda like playing russian roulette isn't it? Lifes a gamble and you may have just crapped out!|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Its alright, calm down a little. :)<br>  <br>  First off, I just want you to know these few facts, alright? A woman's cycle is most vulnerable to getting pregnant two weeks after her period, not just a few days, and two weeks before her next one, when hormones are the strongest and when the egg is released. On top of that, even women who do have their egg released while a mistake like your's happens, only 20% of the time do they get pregnant, which is why some people have to try forever to get the baby they are looking for. That's a pretty slim timeline, if you ask me, for one mistake. :)<br>  <br>  But there IS a chance that you can be pregnant still. If you had sex Monday, since it is almost Friday, it is too late for the Plan B pill which everyone is telling you to look into. Here's the link for it: <a href="http://www.go2planb.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.go2planb.com/</a> This pill is needed to be taken within 72 hours of the mistake you made, which had to have been by Wednesday.<br>  <br>  There's not much else anyone can tell you since you had your period just last week. If you are still unable to calm down after realizing that slim window of chance, then you can get the First Responce Pregnancy tests at WalMart or a local pharmacy, you can get two or three in a box, and you can use these to try and find out if you are pregnant up to a whole week before your next period.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, you'll be fine. :)|`|SqYJRZaEaa	did you now that the morning after pill, is like doing a mini abortion? <br>  are you ready for that? because if you are pregnant, you are pregnant, and whether you take a morning after pill or do an abortion, you will have to terminate pregnancy, and because you are young now, you think this is the only choice and best decision, it is NOT! it will hunt you down for years and years to come. Because it's your baby, the little cute baby! And after you have other kids when you are older and you love and cherish them, it's even worse, because when you look at them, you will always think, why you did not even give a chance to the other one, to your first one...<br>  so you are not ready to become pregnant, please don't have sex, otherwise, there is always a chance, even with birth control.
ELbs3Dpwaa	Try moving some of the smaller items back to their original location for tonight.  Tomorrow or in a few days allow him to help you rearrange or at least watch yo do it.  This way it is not a shock when he goes to bed.  Right now, his room doesn't feel like his room.  As far as he knows you have put him to bed someplace new and that is a scary feeling.  They only understand a small part of the world and take comfort in consistency.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	calm him down.. read him good stories he likes that won't make him more scared. stay with him long and tell him it's all ok.|`|Ny4lALx8aa	Well it could be that he simply liked his old room better and needs to get used to the new one... or the new room could "feel" scary to him. Each room has different energy in it changing the way it feels. Children are very sensitive to these kind of things. Try burning sage in it after he wakes up one morning first thing. Keep him out of the room the whole day until bed time. Open the window in the room to air the smoke out throughout the day with the room door closed. This should clear the energy in the room, and it should take noticable effect.|`|0cfwrcx5aa	you upset all the traps he had laid, now the monsters can get him again.   just get in there, and make some new traps.   also, a flashlight is handy.  get some batteries, paint them, show him the batteries before you put them in the flash light.  tell him that the flashlight now has the power to beam monsters away.    then pretend to see one and shoot it.   but remind him that the batteries could go dead if he uses it too much.     he should settle down after that.<br>  <br>  edit:  just to make sure you understood:  dont paint the metal areas on the top and bottom.  just the sides.|`|KNxs4PrZaa	its not a condition, he is young, it doesnt feel like his safe familiar room.  its like a whole new place that he is going to have to get used to being in and feeling safe in.  it will take time, be patient and spend time with him in there so he gets used to it then when it feels like home again he will sleep there without a problem.|`|CpWGvDvRaa	Aspergers came to mind. But maybe he is just not use to it yet. Try to sleep with him for one night to show him it is ok.|`|cW6YgnB7aa	How old is he? I know that with most younger kids they need to stick with their schedules. My oldest wasn't too bad about mixing things up but my 3yo wont go to sleep unless he follows the same nightly routine.<br>  <br>  You could wait it out and just let him get used to it or you could switch it back, you could also get his input on how he would like his room if he isn't too young..that might help a lot.|`|p0NsUYkRaa	i doubt it is a serious condition, he just isnt used to it, i was the same way when i was little and would cry myself to sleep when my room got cleaned up or moved around, but have him spend more time in there like have a little treasure hunt, play with toys, read stories or just run around in there. if he shows no sign of improvement move it back but give him at least a week and a half to adjust|`|ERPROJM5aa	I dont think you should label it a condition, I would have to say to a child a change in his room might feel very strange and being young he doesn';t know if it should be something to be fearful of or interested in.
MMj7YcXkaa	you probably have a bladder infection  go to DR  meanwhile take tylenol and drink lots of water.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Urinary infections are very common while pregnant, go to the doctor and get tested and treated as soon as possible, if it gets to your baby it could do some harm.|`|xGlqXMRAaa	It sounds like you could have a bladder infection have you told your doctor about this pain? And what did he/she say?
LbwpUA1caa	Sore nipples can be a sign of hormonal actions of pregnancy, but not an early sign and not usually on one side only.  It could also be from biting that occurred during sex.  If this is not the case then I would examine the breast in the mirror.  Look for any dimpling, or popping out.  Go to you tube and see how to perform a breast self examination.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Is your period due soon?  It could just be your hormones changing and getting ready for your menstrual cycle.|`|yaq7oaH6aa	Over reacting.<br>  The combination of the two is almost fool proof.<br>  If the condom is 95 % effective and the spermicide 80%, <br>  (over a year), effective then 20% x 5% = 1% chance <br>  if you did it that way, regularly,  for a year.<br>  One time, - relax and buy tampons.|`|EyKJ737daa	Slim chance of pregnancy sweetie with 2 methods of precautions so I'd say you are just due for your period soon.  I hope it's not a rough month coming up for you cause I know sometimes when I get a really, really bad headache that I can't shake even with nurofen (strong stuff), then I know I'm in for a rough period that month and I'm usually right!  I hope all goes well for you though and all the very best.|`|rGMv0AMtaa	Way way way over reacting.<br>  <br>  A lot of women experience this within their normal hormone cycle.  Are you close to your period? It could be anything from chaffing from a loose article of clothing, or did someone give you purple nurple?? Jk! :)|`|6mB625Edaa	um ur way over reacting and if you really wanna know then go get a preg test or go to planed parenthood!|`|DDnxY3k1aa	ovulation can do that...|`|IZoAmKmFaa	Has it been a week since you've missed your period?  I'm 6 weeks pregnant, I found out when I was 4 weeks 5 days.  My nipples have been sensitive since then, very very very sensitive.  I noticed it through a shirt and semi-padded bra when my boyfriends arm brushed over me.  Also, I was extremely, extremely fatigued and I had period like cramps in the morning then they'd disappear.  <br>  I would say since you used a condom and spermicide you should be pretty safe, but like you said it isn't 100%.  I know it's hard, but try not to worry because that can cause you to skip your period.  If you miss take a test and if you get a negative maybe that will put your mind at ease and you will get your period.|`|0C5TBPEvaa	Way over-reacting. Spermicide plus a condom leaves a very very very slim chance for you to become pregnant. Mine become sore before a period.|`|A1IisrUraa	you are overreacting,, I mean you could be pregnant but my nipples get sore all the time, are you close to your period ?|`|f79tavO3aa	maybe he just bitten to hard

Of course, (and I'm not getting all anti-mj here,) when you under the influence of ANY substance...you don't always think clearly.  That's a shame.|`|VuUz8NgKaa	I would be very upset if someone did that to my daughter. It is common sense to not do that. You have a right to be livid just as I do when my mom decides to light one up on when I do places with her. I have many triggers and being around people that do smoke it one of them.<br>  <br>  I hope she feels better soon.|`|ENANtueuaa	I agree! It's comment sense! But hey, he was stoned...guess he wasn't thinking straight...very immature!|`|5ZwIASCgaa	I agree with you!!!!|`|idn1OQucaa	Based on what I know about Asthma, if he wasn't smoking at the time the smoke and her Asthma wouldn't particularly be the issue on the situation.  His being stoned would be the issue, and so would the fact that he ever gets stoned at all.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	I think I would be pretty upset even if my child didn't have asthma, why come to visit your kid while stoned, yeah that's something to be proud of and show off to your child.

One thing that I do whenever I am getting insurance on my kids is I specifically ask what major traumas they cover.  Forget about broken bones and sicknesses.  These are common injuries nowadays.  I want to know if they will go to bat for my kid when they faced with a life or death situation.|`|bf2b826fb186efa4963970654d24ac34aa	It'd be wonderful to get this story national attention.

I swear the world gets more money hungry everyday, and to do this to a poor child is just a slap in the face! <br>  <br>  The states has got to wake up with this whole medicare thing! I've read what some of you users on y/a have had to pay to have a baby and I can't believe it! and they wonder why more people are opting to have abortions then give birth to a child...it's cheaper to do then to have a baby<br>  <br>  Seriously if Canada can offer free health care then why can't the states as well?|`|Q7jMH5praa	I think it's sick. I think all children should be covered for any medical illness until they are 18. Seriously if I were that baby's parent I would be pulling some John Q ****. My baby would get a heart one way or the other.|`|8a5c549ea7fffbe40a9a737812632ec8aa	this makes me sick. with enough press, hopefully this poor baby will get a hospital or surgeon who will forgo the fees and get this baby a new heart!|`|u6jP7BQNaa	That is tragic.  I hope some way they can get the money.  It's sad that any parent would have to come up with that much cash or let their child die.|`|AOvtRBU9aa	I agree with you 100% but unfortunately there is nothing we can do about it. Our world is driven by money and greed!|`|AA11134717	that is soo sad i about cried when i seen that!|`|WtTUNC8Naa	That is so awful. I cannot believe that our health care system would actually allow a child to die... That is so horrible. I hope this gets obama's attention too, cause something needs to be done about this. This needs to be passed along, so that hopefully they can raise enough money. I would so get a lawyer, that is so horrible. It just makes me think what would i do in that situation. Oh you better believe i would be protesting, contacting my state senator...etc. everything i could, and i know they are doing the same<br>  <br>  I agree, a child's life should not have a price tag!|`|nPtzoAmAaa	I agree it's sickening, but why are so many people so willing to get under national health care over it? Yes, since the government has obviously done such a swell job everywhere else, Let's let them take care of our medical needs to. Wake up people handing the government more power doesn't solve your problems. The baby is under state health care, they are the ones who don't cover it! You really think paying the government a premium would fix everything. . It really is a sad story and maybe someone with the means will help, and no price should be placed on a babies life, I agree. But we are all so quick to let the government fix our problems.|`|p2Njf5gBaa	The US health care system is sickening.  <br>  <br>  that poor baby!  <br>  <br>  Have you ever watched the movie Sicko?  ITs a real eye opener on how f-up the US health care system is compared to others places in the world.  I am and always have been 100% for universal health care.  I think every one deserves health care.  For supposedly being such a rich and advanced country, we sure do live on and believe is some screwed up philosophy's!|`|Fd4lITkvaa	That's unfortunately how our health care system works. I would much rather pay my insurance premiums to the government and know I am always covered for everything that needs to be done rather than worry about what is covered and what isn't and whether or not I will have insurance should I lose my job.|`|wFVLP5l3aa	omg that story made me cry that poor family i hope they get the money in time<br>  being a young family we cant afford to donate anything but im going to post the link for the site on my facebook and myspace to help raise awareness for it and hope that that helps.<br>  <br>  <br>  i dont think something like that would happen in australia we have medicare.<br>  i thought america was supposto be a great country?|`|n6XYYyoLaa	saddening<br>  maddenin<br>  one reason i hate nursing, it's all about the dollar, not the patients anymore|`|ed45267264b8e14db51a0d554e40d2a3aa	That is soooo sad!!! I wish I save this baby's heart :(|`|zQWNb6neaa	I saw this story for the first time yesterday and it literally made my heart ache. My little one is only 2 weeks younger than this precious boy and I cannot imagine the pain and frustration those parents are experiencing. I certainly held my daughter a little tighter after watching it and while praying with my older children before bed gave thanks for our health. Hubby and I talked about it after the story aired and we both agreed that there would be a John Q situation happening if we were in that scenario! I pray that people come to the aid of that child before it is too late.
AA10217725	My colleague and she is right here sitting in front of me. It was her second and she had no idea she was pregnant except for messed periods. she was always irregular for that matter. one day while we were all sitting together we told her she was getting huge and hard and insisted she gets a test. She did and also got an appointment with her doctor. Lol ! She was seven months pregnant with a girl and doing everything in the book she should'nt have been doing.Both mom and baby are doing fine and she's due on April 2nd.|`|IFd94XDkaa	One of my nieces was six months along before she found out she was pregnant.  She had continued to spot a bit and her period was always eratic so she didn't think anything of it.  Everything was fine and her son is 16 now.|`|gRZT4pnUaa	I was 2 months when i found out. I got the neg hpts. They didn't get around to doing my blood tests until i was 4 months. I had/have a blood disorder landon 5 factor. Had to take blood thinner injections daily. Good thing i found out when i did. I could have miscarried! I also had irregular periods. Tell her get Mariana birth control. Lasts 5 years and no periods.lol.|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	yea.  I used to run pregnancy tests.  It happens.  Usually you think it is the bigger women with messed up periods but I've seen some skinny girls to.  Never got their periods and tests kept being negative|`|Leo4z1EFaa	yes a friend of mine was about 5 months too! it was crazy! she ended having it way early and it was tiny but its ok now|`|PwD3slrTaa	Yes, a few actually.  Weird huh?  Poor gals.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	i've played that role.. i don't know how far i would be... but i got a faint positive at lunch today!|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	I was 21 weeks when I found out with my first! However I did do a hpt and it was positive. I had no idea I was that far along though. I have PCOS so I don't have reg periods I usually go 8-10 months w/o one. So I finally figured something was wrong when after having an orgasm my abdomen would get really hard! DUH!!!! I felt like an idiot! but He's 9yo now and perfect. I will add that I found out at 4 weeks with my second and my husband both agreed that we liked finding out later...so it didn't seem like so long to wait for our precious bundle!|`|VhHVjMe8aa	Yes, I was 41/2 months before I got a positive test back! My periods were like clock work and it scared me when my doctor said," if you don't start by next week we will do more tests".  That next week I got blood work done and that's when I found out I was pregnant.  She is doing great! She just got married last July, and is moving to Italy next month!  I will miss her like crazy!!|`|08plsFSHaa	No, I can't say I have. But I seen something on T.v about that. I thought that was crazy! I always get worried though because I have messed up  cycles. In January I didn't get my period at all!|`|3p0QBNpwaa	I did not find out I'm was pregnant until I was 3 months because I was spotting and thought it was my period. <br>  <br>  I also know a girl who did not find out she was pregnant until around 5 months.|`|0C5TBPEvaa	Some women don't know they're pregnant at all.

AOvtRBU9aa	No, not if they have reliable child care. My husband and I both work full time but we work opposite shifts so it will work for us. He works 9-530 while I work 230-1100 so we only need our parents to watch her from 2-6. I would love to stay home but it's just not the best for the both of us. If you can afford it, it is def better to stay home with your baby.|`|XmJZkFuMaa	Someone who's related to the baby is always a better care-giver.  The baby is less-likely to get exposed a million diseases, you can be sure the parent/grandparent do what they believe is best for the child, and while quality time matters, studies have found that quantity time is important too, that day in day out "mom/dad/grandma/grandpa/aunt/uncle is always there" feeling that the kid has, and the fact that sometimes the kid may not open up during the forced hour of quality time like they do during a day alone with the caregiver.<br>  <br>  So yes.  I would say if one of the parents can give up the career, they should.  <br>  <br>  However, there are times when that's not feasible.  And I don't say those parents are bad.  It's just, this is ideal for one of the parents to stay  home, and then secondary it's ideal for another family member, and tertiary it's ideal for a qualified nanny, with day-care scenarios coming in next, and the unqualified under-the-table babysitters I've seen cropping up coming in last.|`|V7JVKApkaa	A loving parent as caregiver is ALWAYS best for children. A nanny should only be used as a last resort. Our kids, age 10 years down to 20 months, have never had a babysitter other than us or grandparents. I know this isn't alsways possible with all families, but we were determined to have only a loving/family caregiver present. My wife works at night, I during the day. With our chosen careers, this is possible. Hope you find an arrangement were you or your husband are mostly there.|`|jNErU39iaa	Not necessarily.<br>  What if the family could not afford to keep a roof over their heads unless both parents were working?<br>  <br>  I think having a place to live, food and adequate clothing are far more important to a baby/child/adult, than one parent spending every waking moment with their baby for the first five years of life.<br>  <br>  Every situation is negotiable, but staying at home is a fantastic opportunity that unfortunately, not everyone can have.|`|9BsyKN9haa	I think theres no right or wrong and. In my case i wanted to stay home. My mom did and I really loved it and all my friends were so jealous. My children and I are really close and I'm happy. I stayed home with them But as soon as my last one is in Kindergarten I will go back to work. I want to for myself. One reason why we decided I should be a SAHM is because my husband is in the military and its nice for our kids to have a parent around to help through a lot of changes in our lives. Again it all depends on what you want and whats best for your family. It's very hard to be a SAHM, but I'm happy to be there and I can always go back to work again.|`|DDnxY3k1aa	i think so. lol. maybe.. depends on the economy. with this economy it's understandable it's hard to get and keep jobs. but it depends on the person.. and how much they want to give to the baby.. cuz i'd love that idea.. but i probably couldn't do it a full 5 years cuz i must give the baby enough. idk... i'm new.... lol...|`|g6HCRAP7aa	well, since i'm not a parent, i can't give you a specific answer but both my parents had careers and raised me & my brother with the help of my grandparents who watched us in the day. i consider my parents and i to be pretty close, especially compared to some of my friends.<br>  <br>  also, my baby cousin used to be cared for at home by my grandparents also but they moved and he had to attend daycare. the first few days were very rough because the transition from one-on-one care to something like daycare is very different but, in the end, he ended up just fine. <br>  i think sending a baby to daycare is not a bad idea because, in five years, they'll just be that much more ready for school. however, relatives are the best choice if the parents can't be there.<br>  <br>  sorry if this didn't help|`|AuqZZBHjaa	It's all a matter of opinion.  I have been a stay at home mom for almost 8 years, and wouldn't have it any other way.  I feel very fortunate that I am able to stay home.  I am very close to my daughters, and though it's hard, it's very rewarding.  Sometimes it isn't feasible for a parent to stop working though.  <br>  <br>  I would say, if you can afford to do so, stay home.|`|Q4Hz8uWCaa	Yes, it would be better. If they do decide to get a nanny, it will be hard to discipline the child and the child will more than likely grow up to hate them. I'm sure one of them can give up their careers for a minute or spend evry moment they can with the child.
vdXnvJwMaa	the reason you wait is because each cycle you you have after a miscarriage will give you 20% better chance of conceiving and not miscarrying a second time.  I know you are anxious but i miscarried in october and I am still having crazy long cycles that are very irregular with some abnormal spotting.  Please consider waiting and giving your body time to heal and prepare itself for a healthy full term pregnancy.  at least 3 months.  if you are wanting to try then yes a opk would help but you will need to stock up because your cycles are so screwed up that you may get a lot of negatives.  good luck!

0unqJPehaa	I think you should keep the baby and learn from your mistakes, take responsibility for your actions. You made the adult choice to have sex and now you need to be an adult and raise your child.<br>  <br>  But, if you truly don't think you can handle taking care of the child, then put it up for adoption, I am glad you don't want to abort it and would be willing to let it go to a loving home, I'll give you credit for that.|`|HjJknB8Iaa	I know it hurts to let go of your own child, but do you have any support for when she's born?<br>  Is your family going to help you pay for diapers and everything?<br>  <br>  I think the best option is to give her up, even though you love her.<br>  <br>  You can always have another baby in the future, when you're ready and can take care of her.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	If ur willin to take the time and be the best parent u can be then i would keep her, esp. since u have family support and stuff.  If u don't think u could handle the responsibility it takes then u should give her up for adoption and give her to a family who will love her and care for her.<br>  Oh and good for u for not gettin an abortion, that's a great decision, cuz that's just not the way outta an unwanted teen pregnancy.<br>  Just cuz ur young doesn’t mean u can’t be a good parent, don’t listen to the negative stuff about teen parents, listen to urself and what u feel is right for u and ur baby.<br>  I’m 17 and I have a 9 month old son and people are impressed with how good of a parent I am.  Course that’s 4 years older than u are, but my younger sis is only 10 years old and she has a 7 month old daughter and she’s a great mother.<br>  Do what u feel is right for u and ur baby, don’t listen to the negative stuff, only u know what u can and can’t handle, and u have ur family to support u in whatever decision u make, which is very good.<br>  If u every need to talk feel free to email me anytime, and I’ll be happy to help anyway I can.<br>  Hope this helps and good luck honey, :D.|`|AA10411777	can you provide the resources love and care the baby needs. Trust me they take alot If i were in your shoes I would have an open adoption. trust me when you are 16 and can't go out with your friends beacuse there is no sitter or you have no money for clothes cost its all spent on diapers you might resent your baby. An open adoption allows you to be involved in the childs life but your more like an aunt or a sister to the child then its parent.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i think you need to give the child up for adoption.<br>  <br>  speaking from personal experience, raising a child as a teen is hard!!! (i had mine at 19, and that was still hard) i cannot imagine how hard it would be at 13....<br>  <br>  there is such thing as "open adoption" where you can still be involved in the child's life- like to be an aunt or something. i think that is what you should look into.<br>  <br>  either way MAJOR KUDOS to you for not aborting!!!! whether you choose to keep or give up for adoption, at least you did not do that!|`|HpWCjBv6aa	I'm on the boat for calling you a troll.<br>  <br>  It's incredibly hard to believe that you're thirteen, having a child in June, and don't already know whether or not you're giving it up for adoption.  It is doubly hard to understand how you didn't learn from your sister's mistake.|`|1RwZZ2aPaa	Give that baby up for adoption. <br>  There are such things as open adoptions  you know, where you can actually still see pictures of the child and maybe even visit them.|`|49wnU3s0aa	The choice is all up to you!(: Do what makes you happy, you must be under soo much stress right now.|`|XrKviWgSaa	do what you feel is best FOR YOU AND THAT BABY, if you think you can provide a good stable home, finish school and get a good education, and get a job while raising her then do it. but if you think she will be better off with a family that can not have kids then do that. im a soon to be mother and im still in school and im going to be a stay at home mom probably until me and my boyfriend move in together so i know she is safe while im at work. if you do not think you will be able to live with the decision of adoption then do not do it, i was thinking about adoption and every time i looked at anything that had to do with it i broke down crying.|`|NgeZASTYaa	Ignore the harsh comments - they are vexations to the spirit.<br>  <br>  But, it is best to give her up to a married couple.<br>  <br>  ALL babies deserve a mom AND a dad, FULL TIME<br>  <br>  I'm sorry, but you can't provide that.<br>  <br>  please take care young woman (and wait til you married before having sex again *__* ).<br>  <br>  regards<br>  <br>  TH|`|VWaSojThaa	Look I am pregnant and I am about to be 18 barely and i will keep my baby. I know you don't feel ready but take parenting classes and economically its obvious you can't be on your own but if your family is supporting you then well they will be there for you and help you. Yea you did a msitake you are young same as me but if you really want to you will be a good mom. But you have to be mature from now on.|`|dYzQuosBaa	lets compare you to me.<br>  <br>  <br>  Im 13, but the biggest responsibility i have is to remember to put my rubberbands on my teeth so my braces dont get messed up and i cant even remember to do that half the time.<br>  <br>  <br>  Go ahead and go through with it. "<br>  <br>  you made a good choice and not aborting it "god appreciates your great miracle"<br>  <br>  But i would do an open adoption, be an aunt. <br>  <br>  you know that your not going to be able to support this baby. <br>  <br>  and then it will have to suffer when you cant afford it.. <br>  <br>  People would be so happy if they go that miracle in their life, <br>  <br>  take advantage of that option.  Help someone out. i promise it will make you feel good about yourself.|`|4iXL4C6paa	all you can do is have your baby, love it and be a great mother, and prove to people that wish to judge you wrong....I understand that you are just a child but you have put yourself in a woman situations so ignore ignorant comments and be a loving mother to your baby.  God bless.<br>  <br>  ...and of course there is always the choice of adoption if you feel like that is best|`|fruO1G62aa	I think you shouldn't think of your self and how much you love the baby I don't mean it's not important because it is but you should think of the baby and what education you can give it to her/him in the future ! and you should think of all those people that can give her so much but can't have a baby.|`|VZ3KoJr2aa	I wasnt gonna answer this...but keep the baby.<br>  Imagen u give it up..all ur life u will wonder where he/she is all her life and he/she will find out and wonder why u gave her/him up. Then you both will look for each other the rest of ur lifes!! I mean its condemming both of u of a life of this emptyness. look, just put urself in ur babies decision. Would u rather have sufered wondering where is ur real mom or would u rather live with ur real mom, know ur real family even if it ment that it wouldnt have luxsuires or expensive clothing, ect. I mean u can do it with ur family's support. If they are willing to pay for the baby while u stay home and finish school then it would make perfect sense to take care of it. You can finish this year then do homeschooling on line. Its 100% free and they give u a laptop and money for internet so u CAN finish school even online. U still take ur sat's and all that. Give it lots of thought. I am homeschooled oh its k12 if ur intrested, email me or im. They even have a live talk session for teen mothers who chose that school because they are pregnant, I can send u the link. Let me know ok, they talk about dressing, changing and babies and what to exspect. No critizism at all. I'm 16 and want to help you if u wanna talk or need advice links or want to homeschool just email. And again think how wonderful it will be having a beautiful baby when it calls u momy!!!  its not the end of the world it will be ok just let ur parents know what u are thinking and they will understand.|`|ywer453paa	Do what is right in your heart. You can give her up, and still stay in contact with her... or you can keep her. IF you do give her up, keep in mind it has nothing to do being a bad parent. There are adults who give up their children for numerous reasons.   <br>  <br>  By the time you're 20, she'll be 7 or so (pending on how old she is now.. or even if she's born. I'm kinda confused) and having a 7 year old at 20 can be difficult. By the sounds of it you have a wonderful family, and from what I gather everything will work out just fine. <br>  <br>  Love her unconditionally. Stay strong! :)|`|BRNNVcMOaa	only you can answer this and you did the right thing by taking responsibility and going through with the pregnancy. a baby is a precious gift. my heart is with you and you will make the best decision for the baby when it is said and done.<br>  God bless<br>  p.s. you can email me if you just need someone to talk to.|`|WeJBlyqsaa	This is a tough situation. On the one hand your love your little baby growing inside you very much but on the other hand you are only 13! Sweetheart I am 23 and am pregnant with my 2nd child though I love my son who is 18 months I also know that I am still young and do want to go out and have fun! You are still a baby yourself honey! But here is what I think, if you really think that you are 100% DO NOT LET ANYONE TELL YOU ANY DIFFERENT! If you need anything anything at all email me nbennett913@gmail.com!! Have faith trust in god and your family and you will do just fine i assure you!|`|RCRTyVKKaa	Keep your baby the best place is for her to be with with you. But if your unsure of you being able to look after her the give her away.<br>  <br>  <br>  I was 16 when i had my first and im 17 now and pregnant with my second only about 4 weeks.|`|l1STgPyRaa	you have the support of you family that is great so i would keep the child.<br>  <br>  teen mom's have a harder time in life that is why lot of us are ageist it stay in school get a good education and have a great life. <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|crZg76Hpaa	damnnnnnnnnnnn you 13. Give her away, you aren't prepared to be a mother, nor can you provide properly for your child. You can't even legally get a job. I'm sorry if this upsets you but you shouldn't have had sex so young.|`|Ei1TcLclaa	Okay, I'm 19 and pregnant, but 13 would have to be way to young for me! If you want to keep her, then keep her! <br>  Have you ever seen The Secret Life of an American Teenager? It's one of my favorite shows!!<br>  Kryssah|`|td0Dz1LRaa	keep your baby.<br>  just learn from this.<br>  <br>  sweety 13 is wayy to young to be having a child. there's really no turning back.<br>  just learn from this.|`|SzaRLDVmaa	it ur life u do it in sure u must taker about this baby because he did not make any mistak  2 have that and take ur god alround u|`|ef54194b6513e470afed5b1b44be736faa	I am really proud of you for deciding to keep the baby and preserve the life of a child. You are young, and it will be hard, but your whole family is behind you and as long as they support you, you will make it through. so, keep the baby. it is a blessing and through hard times like this, good things come out.|`|5tqh0akYaa	no offense but i think your a troll. Your 13 and your sis 14 (or whatever one you are) are both pregnant. Yeah thats likely<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  and your not a 'kid' you had sex, deal with it|`|r39EDGhPaa	time to grow up.<br>  you can't be "only" 13 anymore.  if you wanna keep that baby, you have to figure out how you're going to get a job and raise it without your parents helping.  because, well, that's what adults do.  by keeping that baby you are saying "i'm going to be an adult." so your life as a kid is over.  you made that decision, and im not going to pity you.  your mindset wasn't "im only 13" when you laid down and got yourself knocked up.  you were "oh so mature" and "ready for this!".  looks like reality slapped you in the face.<br>  <br>  give the baby up for adoption if you want to.  that's up to you.  but be 100% positive you want to, because once you do, there's no getting her back.  it would be the more responsible thing to do, considering you can't get a job or even provide for yourself.. how will you provide for a baby?  <br>  <br>  don't ask people on here what to do.  you should be ready to make that decision on your own.  that's one of the things that come along with having sex.. making the right decisions.|`|t7LlAmZnaa	Sit down and really think of everything you wanted to do with your life. Are those things still possible with the baby? You're just 13, you're attached to the baby now (I'm assuming it's not born yet), but you'll grow more and learn who you are and just how capable you really are of loving someone else. You'll surprise yourself. Your ability to love and care will only grow, and the best thing you can do for the baby is to give it the healthiest, happiest life you can. If you really think that you can do that by raising it yourself then the decision is clear. No one can make the decision for you, and don't let anyone try. Just remember hat motherhood is more than playing with the baby and getting to dress it up in cute clothes. It is a job that quickly teaches you the definition of "forever."|`|kRaVa0Wraa	it would be amazing to give the gift of life to a couple who cant have kids of their own. it would be hard, but you dont know how much it would mean to them.<br>  also, you could have an open adoption, meaning you could keep tabs on your baby. :)<br>  <br>  plus, 13 is very young. VERY young. you have a lot of maturing to do. are you sure youre going to be a great mother?|`|QOukwuFhaa	Babe, pay absolutely NO attention to the idiots that judge you just for having a child young. That's exactly what they are, idiots. I'm glad you decided to keep your beautiful gift from Mother Earth. How far along are you? :D|`|aqto0hJTaa	Give her to a family who will love and support her.<br>  <br>  Grow up, get an education, and find a career.<br>  <br>  Then, you have a baby that YOU can support.  It'll be the best for all concerned.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you.
Jime0cdqaa	No but I've watched a lot of adoptions take place in front of me in the court room. It depends on the circumstances. Is the child's parent(s) working on a case plan? Have their rights already been terminated? Are you already a foster parent to the child you want to adopt? Try talking to someone in your county that works for DCF.|`|TyjAcOQ7aa	no... why would you ask a question like that?|`|C9q5fh63aa	no
mDm8yFcMaa	My little one is a sleep!! :) Yippee!! After being sick for a week she is finally back to her sleeping schedule...so nice.|`|jYPeis3Saa	nope. he's asleep.|`|JnLoHaoAaa	No thank goodness she's asleep. It's almost 3 am here|`|LDHu66Vraa	mine are all in bed. :)|`|6406692cdee68eada489967d4ed23befaa	Both are asleep!|`|ByoYmFsBaa	Wow, it got a lot of good comments on youtube. I'm going to try it tomorrow before naptime.<br>  <br>  Thanks for posting it. :-)|`|e44b849c03813ab357cd9f858138dd8eaa	My baby boy is asleep! But thx :)|`|AA11134717	no my baby girl is sleeping.<br>  but thanks|`|oXIYHsDaaa	they have both been asleep since 8:00pm|`|OgzHcNMsaa	Mine is awake and having a bottle now so after she's done I'm gonna see if this works. It has great comments though so I added it  to my lullaby playlist. Thanks!
oRaYQNXxaa	Making sure that you are healthy and well taken care of is vital to producing enough breast milk for your baby. <br>  Make sure you are eating like you should. Also drinking at least 8 glasses of water a day will help with the milk production too. As soon as you start getting dehydrated guess what? There goes your milk. <br>  I know its hard but try getting as much sleep as you can too. If you are exhausted your body is exhausted and will not work as hard either. Thankfully you seem to have a good supportive husband that is helping out as much as possible. <br>  If you are worried about your son eating to much you might want to bring that up to discuss with his pediatrician at his next visit. This could be cause for concern as well. <br>  <br>  I hope that my advice helped and good luck and congratulations to you and your family on the new addition :)|`|ggfE4rlvaa	Drink a lot of water, and don't skip any meals. your body needs food to produce milk so, if you don't eat you won't produce as much. also drinking milk will help.Snacking during the day can help as well. Doing the whole six small meals instead of 3 big ones.<br>  <br>  On another note you could be one of those cases where moms just dry up for no apparent reason at all, I sure hope not!<br>  <br>  Best of luck and congrats on your baby!|`|QAGhFzFsaa	You are probably making enough milk for him... babies go through a growth spurt around 3 weeks... mine had his at 2 1/2 weeks... (3wks, 6wks,3mths....ext.) and during their growth spurts they eat... NONSTOP! I felt the same way you did and I still do at times, I"ve learned more from mommies on here then I have in any book I've read. They have all really told me... let nature take it's own course... your body will make exactly what your little one needs. As for the eating and sleeping thing, you NEED to eat and sleep (and trust me there are many days I forget to eat until about 7pm) your body will literally shut down and you will have no energy to even move... eat granola bars... breakfast shakes...things you only need one hand for and eat them while you're feeding... when he goes down from a nap you go down as soon as you can. forget about the house work for right now... ask for help (it sounds like your husband is ready to help... good man!) everyone knows when you have a new born (especially your first) everyone needs a helping hand. You will do it and you'll be wonderful at this mommy thing in no time! Good luck and congrats!|`|5ItOGyVHaa	baby sucking helps bring in your milk supply. if you need to give formula then still put baby on the breast before she is done eating. so she can suck and stimulate your supply <br>  <br>  there is an herbal pill i took that my lactation consultant gave me that had me so full i was dripping in like 2 days. i can't spell it but it is something like dom-perry-on. similar to the fancy champagne <br>  <br>  you can call the hospital and ask to talk to the lactation consultant. they are great and will help with Your concerns. <br>  <br>  also. 1-2 hour naps for you will be normal for a while. don't expect to sleep threw the night for a long time still. babies are Just like that.|`|DTe1dumFaa	Everyone here has given you good advice. You should hang in there and persevere. I breast fed two heavy boys and wanted to give up about this time. Don't give up! No one has yet given you the most important advice... GIVE HIM A PACIFIER! <br>  He is probably suckling for comfort no babies need to eat that much. Also keep drinking loads of juice and water and eat plenty of healthy foods.<br>  Do not give him formula. That can be the first step to giving up the breast.  visit lalecheleague website. Don't give up breast feeding I promisi it will get so much easier and is much better for your baby. Good luck!|`|rI0d7K9Zaa	I had the same problem with my daughter when she was that age. You feel like they arent getting enough because they want to eat so often. Let him eat as much as you can possibly handle. The sucking will help you to produce the milk. It takes a few days for your milk to catch up with the demand of an infant who is feeding a lot so for a couple of days it will be a full time job. The milk will come though don't worry. Drink a ton of liquids while baby eats try for .5 or 1 litre with every feed I know it seems like a ton of water and you'll be peeing all the time but it will also help. There is a pill you can talk to your Dr. about called Donperidone, its actually used to cure stomache problems but in breastfeeding mothers it is useful in milk production however once you start taking it you can't stop or your milk will decrease so if you are going that route you have to stick with the pills. Also they cost about $50 a month and you have to take 2 pills 4 times daily but they really do work. Hang in there. Only 1% of woman are physically not able to breastfeed according to statistics so if you work through your problems you should be sucessful!! Goodluck it will get easier even though now you probably feel like your a 24hour restaurant.|`|hrVbxk8Jaa	I had the same problem. The lact. specialist told me to get fenugreek. It is a herb at any store and just take it as directed on the bottle. OMG u will get so much milk its ridiculous. I swear by it.|`|LDWuRWTjaa	SImply eat while you feed him. Take Prenatal vitamins (they help produce the milk and keep it healthy)|`|83nHy2PXaa	you really should rest, eat and drink a lot.<br>  fenugreek works miracles, also blessed thistle - take 2 capsules of each one of those 3 times a day. these are very good for milk production.<br>  you can also try some teas. I used the mother's milk tea by traditional medicinals - it contains some other herbs along with the fenugreek and blessed thistle.<br>  you should be able to increase it with those. I think it would take 1.5 to 2 hours at least for your baby between the feedings, even if you are producing enough. Later on you may be able to stretch it to 3 hours.<br>  Also, if you pump right after he nurses for 5-10 minutes - it will also help, it sends a signal to your brain to produce more.<br>  Finally, pumping or nursing at night is the most effective, as the levels of prolactine are higher and more milk will come out.|`|IusKKGE7aa	Eat, drink and rest. Repeat as much as u can. Like stated, things u can eat with one hand is a great choice. Fruit, nuts, ensure or boost drinks. Have hubby make you a sandwich and cut it into halves or fourths so u can eat it while u feed him. U need additional calories to produce milk- at least 500 calories more than usual. That's a banana and a big glass of milk or a turkey sandwich and juice. u can do it, believe us. I know it's hard and u feel like breaking down. If u want to cry it out, do it. just when ur done, go to sleep if he's sleeping and eat if he's eating. It will blow over. Nipple stimulation produces milk, too, so keep at it. There is a light at the end of this seemingly never ending tunnel. congrats and good luck!
ggfE4rlvaa	She's probably throwing up from not getting all the gas out of her tummy. A lot of kids need to be burped more than just once. Like my daughter, she burps at least 4 good ones, if she doesn't she will puke everything up. Otherwise she might not be getting the "Full" feeling from having gas in her tummy as well, so if she eats and then burps she might feel a bit sick to her stomach. try burping her for a bit longer or see if you can get more out of her! Good luck!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	no you cant overfeed a breastfed baby|`|oXIYHsDaaa	are you breast feeding or feeding expressed milk ? At around 1 month most babies have what are refereed to as "frequency days" where all they want to do all day is nurse, they do this in order to increase mom's milk supply because they will be needing more milk. If you are bottle feeding expressed milk you are kind of messing with the natural rhythm, baby's instincts say to nurse more to increase the milk, she doesn't know that you can just put more milk in the bottle. Breast fed babies will not over eat, but it is very possible that she is comfort sucking on the bottle like she would on the breast, if that's the case either offer her the breast directly or if you are bottle feeding only offer her a soother.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Sounds more like gas than overeating.  Make sure there's a good burp after she eats or all of the air in the tummy will project the milk right back up. And then, baby is hungry again and eating more often.<br>  There are a couple of different burping positions that work a little better than just over the shoulder...<br>  lay baby on her stomach across your lap and pat her back. this puts a little more pressure on the stomach)<br>  sit baby on your lap facing forward and pat her back<br>  hold baby with one hand on her stomach, facing forward.<br>  this is what finally helped our daughter.<br>  Good luck!|`|6xuQqEMJaa	Congrats for breastfeeding!!<br>  <br>  how much vomiting are you talking about?<br>  a few table spoons or the whole feeding?<br>  <br>  does it happen often?  and do you keep a food diary?<br>  <br>  i would really suggest you keep a food diary and a diary of the formula you give her.<br>  she might have some food allergies.<br>  <br>  my daughter was vomiting a lot after every feeding, or most feedings.<br>  it broke my heart because i had low milk supply and i needed to WORK at my supply.<br>  So i started a diary of all the food i was taking and realized that my baby would vomit everytime i had dairy in my diet a few hours before.<br>  <br>  When i stopped dairy products all together, the vomiting completely stopped.<br>  i am not saying this is the only reason for vomiting but it is worth looking into.<br>  <br>  here is my bible for everything about breastfeeding:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/food-sensitivity.html#protein" rel="nofollow">http://www.kellymom.com/babyconcerns/foo...</a><br>  <br>  i hope you find some answers on there.<br>  good luck!
6PEOqeLOaa	I would call your doctor now... explain the situation to the nurse they may want to see you. are you sure he/she is not playing in your ribs i know that caused some discomfort for me. I know when my little guy is head down and he gets the hiccups i feel it in my but and vaginal area could that be what your feeling? i am only suggesting these thoughts so you don't freak out to much you dont want to stress the baby!<br>  <br>  call your doctor see what he thinks!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Either call your clinic and ask for the dr on call or go to the E.R. to get checked out.|`|wJDfFutBaa	Your not in labor. Don't worry, its been happening to me since about 28 weeks. They could be Braxton Hicks, but more likely you are getting "charlie horses". All the ligaments are stretching around the womb to make more room for your baby that is now packing on the pounds. My best advice is don't let yourself lay on your back, or have to strain to move positions. The vagina pains are HORRIBLE. If you start feeling like you have to poop really bad but can't, then call your nurse line at the local hospital....that could be labor.
K2jT1z5jaa	hey darling earliest would be 8 - 10 weeks.<br>  But best time would be after 8 weeks. Also the position on where baby can affect. Everyone is different. <br>  Dont get freaked out darling. Sometimes professionals cant find the heartbeat - like midwife. The older the baby inside the more clearer the beat should be. the first time i heard bubs heartbeat was at 16 weeks.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|EyKJ737daa	Generally you will hear your baby's FHB (Fetal Heart Beat) around 10-12 weeks and it does also depend on how your baby is lying in the womb too as to whether it can be heard strong or not at all. Good luck and hope the device works well for you.  Congratulations sweetie and all the best.|`|SSFy8eHNaa	It just depends.  It's different for everyone.<br>  Sometimes you can hear it that early, sometimes not.<br>  Dont be freaked out.|`|HPRlEWu1aa	about 11-12 weeks .. it may be hard to find at 1st dont freek out.<br>  <br>  im now almost 15 weeks and i can hear the babys heartbeat thru my belly button with the doppler lol .. thats his spot|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Im not really sure but i think that would be too early, i would wait til i was about 20 weeks.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	12 weeks 2 days with my daughter.|`|LbwpUA1caa	Typically, it takes about 8 weeks.  It is also hard sometimes to position the doppler just right.  Be sure to use the gel and move the probe around until you hear the heartbeat.|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	Anywhere from 10-12 weeks starting, hon. :) The baby's heartbeat will be much faster then your dull 'thud-thud'. And it does take some looking for. Don't ever be nervous if you can't find it right away. My doctor couldn't even find it my first prenatal visit at 16 weeks...
7TYuCafDaa	Yup I got that quite a bit and sometimes people would comment. I am 19 years old (my daughter is 7 weeks old) but I was 18 when I got pregnant. My husband and I were in line at the store and their was an old lady behind us. She asked how far along I was and after I told her she said "I hope you are going to give that baby up for adoption. Do you even know who the father is?" Needless to say my husband gave her quite an earful. She was white as a sheet and speechless when my husband finished telling her off. Yes, some may think I'm too young to be married and be a mom but that does not mean I deserve rude comments from people who do not even know me.|`|sIr2fWh6aa	Yes, I'm 21, and have been married for a year, and I'm 7 months pregnant.  People and their daughters (especially the ones that you can tell are sleeping around at a young age) and make comments to where I can hear them, and point and whisper, and even say things to me sometimes.. I just let them go, though, because I know the real truth.  They're the ones with the problem.  Just don't worry about what other people think because you know yourself, and how old you are and how long you've been married, etc.  Good luck! :)|`|3w7VztEWaa	That is one thing I'm am not excited for.<br>  A girl messaged me on here calling me  freak bc I was pregnant at 16..<br>  Like I need anymore stress. I really don't want to know what those kind of people think of me. I mean someone gets alcohol poisoning or ods on something and they are thought no less for not being responsible. I don't maybe I shouldn't compare the two. but just the same It's hard to make the best of things when people are always putting you down.they make me want to prove them wrong and prove I can do. i guess they are motivated me in a critical way.|`|LDiBjNf5aa	Lots of people shared answers and experiences here:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AigjfnD3jgwBtpCCIVv0A9Lty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090216215924AAziPc3">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|T48smu01aa	Yea I have been married a year and I am pregnant now I am 22 and people just stare at me like you are disgusting or wow she looks to young to be having a baby....maybe its just me being pregnant, but I just want to turn around and say WTF is your problem! ha ha its irritating!|`|6L9jJnchaa	Not yet, thank god, lol.|`|VzLkSZ4faa	I'm only 17 weeks and barely showing but it is starting to get noticable through my clothes. I to look young and when I'm alone at the store or anything without my boyfriend I get a lot of strange looks. I am VERY moody and easily aggitated (since I'm pregnant I'm off some anxiety meds that calm me down) now days, gotta live those hormones. I'm glad that there haven't been any comments that I've heard. But I know there saying something (it's hard to hide something that is obvious). I've gotten to where I always have my boyfriend with me to keep me calm and keep the people from talking (if you could see him you'd understand).|`|cO9sxO9raa	Well I am pretty young myself, but I am married and am sure my husband and I will be great parents. I got pregnant pretty much right after our wedding and now that I am 34 weeks older ladies stare at me ALL the time. It gets VERY annoying because these people have no idea who they are judging or our stories so sometimes you feel like screaming your head off at them, but usually we just walk away because it's not worth it. =) Don't worry the most amazing part is the fact that you have a blessing in your life, our little baby girl is totally worth it and those ladies can get a life. =)|`|VT24zOomaa	well, i always get crazy looks, because everyone thinks i'm some 15 year old who's knocked up, but one time i was at wal-mart, and i was buying some tobacco for my dad, and an employee walked by and was like oh your 18. i thought you were 15. i just looked at her and said. actually i'm 20. i thought i was gonna die! but i just smiled and kept walking.|`|apUkTo3maa	WHY DO YOU CARE WHAT EVERYONE THINKS.

wJDfFutBaa	Your uterus has a very thick and hard layer of fat protecting it while baby is under construction. It is much more noticeable right under your breasts because normal fat doesn't seem to store there as well as in the lower abdomen. The hardness is very good, just means that the baby is well protected in it's little capsule!|`|1CryEnb3aa	Its just "where" your baby is or is pushing against at the moment.  Once, the baby runs out of room, your belly will be a lot harder every where.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Yeah, thats how mine is, and I wasn't even overweight at all.  I'm almost 41 weeks :( and they tell me the baby has dropped or whatever, but i still feel like the top of my belly is harder.  I wonder why that is...I thought i was the only one.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	I feel like that as well but i just border on being overweight, i think its just where the baby is lying.|`|Lg4BkwWOaa	thats how it is for most people. its just because its hard to work out your lower abs, so the top is usually stronger
gWryQgf8aa	I think shes crazy!!! Who WANTS to have 14 children under the age of 8? <br>  <br>  And Jon and Kate plus 8 are amazing!! Whoever said that is crazy too. They take amazing care of their kids. Kate is a genius. <br>  <br>  And the family that had the 18th kid, the Duggars. They have been making news for a few years now. They are a very religious family and don't believe in birth control. And they take very well care of their kids too. People should maybe look them up before putting them down!!<br>  <br>  About Octo-mom tho, i heard she was getting her house taken away because she can't pay. I think shes stupid for having that many kids and being single!!|`|0lqxbryuaa	I think that you are crazy!  You dont have anything more interesting to talk about!  How crazy.demented, and psychotic are you??  Your a lame who has no life!  Its her problem, her kids, not yours to worry and by the way 6+8=14  So go and take some math classes ok sweety!!  And while your there get a life!|`|BUCwZYnzaa	she has 14 kids and yeah it is wrong. when i first heard this, i thought her and her hubby were trying to get preggers and what not. then i heard she was NOT married and she had 6 other kids. what a shame|`|6okAIPIlaa	She has 14 kids not 16...and only 6 embryos were implanted the last time, and two of them separated into twins.<br>  <br>  P.S.  Her website is a joke too!|`|WN9TBg3Saa	I don't care enough to have an opinion about her.|`|WU3iVaa0aa	Yeh .. i guess she is a lil mentally ill...<br>  <br>  God Bless her children|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	sick of hearing bout this woman|`|3oSQQt6maa	This is so old.....who cares! sorry.|`|575w52loaa	Yep...she's crazy...personally I think that the only reason she went ahead with all the babies at one time and didn't do the selective reduction was for publicity and handouts...she'll get lots of help and lots of handouts...those babies aren't going to need anything...Everyone else will be taking care of them....|`|DLuDSbkdaa	she now has 14 babies all under the age of seven - and she had 6 eggs implanted and 2 spilt into 2 so they are twins - this ppwerson is in need of serious  help   <br>  she is a baby hoarder and she has a mental illness - im sure she means well and that she does love her babies  - but if these wee dio ogs and she was hoarding dogs and  bringing home dogs and living in a 3 bedroom house with 14 dogs the city would tell her they have to take the dogs and leave her with 2  -   some ppl hoard animals    this oone hoards children   - the doctor has to take some responsibility for the implantaion of 6 embreos    in most western countries this would not be allowed  doctors usualy only implant 2 eggs  - i feel sorry fpor her parents  cause they know she is a wacko<br>  <br>  all her other children were concieved this way  is this gods way of telling her that she wasnt meant to have children  - cause the mother said she is unable to have children the normal way   -0 whatever that means  - she hass a serious mental illness and the ones to suffer will be the kids|`|iMULlxdgaa	I never liked her she always seemed off.  She's an asshole, because of her baby greedy she now has  3 or 4 disabled newborns and its just wrong on so many levels what she did.|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	and you dont find yourself abnormal at all obcessing over people you dont know from anywhere ..but tv? hmmmmm|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	I think people like you are wasting your time. And I think its crazy she wanted that many kids but she is not a crazy person. Everyone has crazy things they do. I think people are giving her too much attention. Just let her and her children live in peace.<br>  <br>  I also wanted to add have you ever heard of the show John and Kate Plus 8? If not watch it. They have 8 children but instead of people thinking their crazy they love them. Why is that? Just because the octo-mom is single? Thats not fair. And also I heard of someone just having their 18 child. I dont understand why people decide to pick on the octo-mom. Get a life, sorry if that sounds rude.|`|AA11994092	She is 100% INSANE. She had the first 6 children without a husband by  sperm Donner. Six children are more than any SINGLE mother should take care of. Heck I raised 3 sons by myself,and that was difficult. to deliberately go and have 8 more that is just INSANE.<br>  She has been living with her mother,and because of that her own mother could not make her house payments so now her own Mother is going to loose her home,and this was with 6 out of wedlock Children. Now the ignorant stupid excuse for a woman has 14 that my dear is the epitome of INSANITY. That woman should have all 8 of those babies taken away from her and adopted to families that can not have children,who would support them and give them a good home,insted of EXPECTING hard working Tax Payers to give her welfare.|`|nlKZRNqmaa	unfortunately she seems really immature. If BOTH her parents can say nothing but negative things about her... well what does that tell you? Her own mother said she hid the pregnancy thing from her saying it was a tumor.. If I was her mother I would slap her around.|`|1jwbQaZTaa	i dont think anyone likes her... that includes me. ive never heard ANYTHING positive about her. ever.
T1q4GWLkaa	Lainey Rose or Alexis Rose sound the best.  I like the name Alexia, but not with Rose.|`|hVrfm4eIaa	Alexis Rose is cute.<br>  <br>  Please don't name your daughter Alexia.  Alexia is actually a disorder where one loses the complete ability to read, usually caused by neurological damage.|`|vXR5L8Jfaa	Alexis Rose for sure.

I think it gives it something extra. Maybe you will like it too? It's pronounced ah-less-ee-uh, not like Alicia (ah-lee-c-uh)|`|pHIUUnOiaa	Alexia Rose or Alexis Rose there my favorite by far very beautiful choices!|`|fboC1N7gaa	Lainey or Alexis|`|u7UnUZXnaa	Alexia Rose (:|`|DP48dIxhaa	Alexis Rose.|`|a1b7363978e397f1d4527a8de30ab150aa	Alexis Rose.

5PWEBOj0aa	well i guess thats way better then my aunt breast feeding my cousin until he was 4!!|`|ElVoXeqlaa	i got breast feed never had formula and my teeth are perfect too. id stop the bottle about 2   2 1/2|`|bBSAFsrhaa	well if nothings wrong with you then i dont think its a problem|`|idrLEQZ7aa	5 is too old for a child to have a bottle.  Can you imagine going to Kintergarden and coming home to drink a bottle. No Way!<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  Well then if you didn't have it in Kintergarden, atleast no one teased you about it then.
IU4uNH97aa	Well for us with our second baby he wasn't really planned and was conceived only a month after our first was born. After which he was premature and born at 27 weeks so we have a 6 month old and a new born baby in the hospital.<br>  <br>  Our second child is only 18 months apart older then our 3rd child. We decided that we wanted another one and thought it would take while for us to really conceive the baby but he was conceived right away. Making them so close in age.<br>  <br>  Our fourth is only 13 months younger then our third. We wanted them close so we planned them to be really close in age.<br>  <br>  With the baby we are due with now by the time the baby is born she/he will be 16 months younger then our fourth born child. <br>  <br>  We wanted our kids to be close in age so they could relate to similar things and i think if your closer in age you have a closer relationship with one another. Plus we wanted the diaper and potty training age all to be done with around the same area. Our oldest if fully potty trained, our second is almost completely done potty training and our third is starting to learn. When this baby is born we should have 2 kids in diapers, 2 fully potty trained and 1 in the middle. So eventually they will all be done with that stuff and i will never have to look at it again !<br>  <br>  This one will be our last for a while because we want to see how well our family adjust with the new baby with the older kids now. If we did decide on having another we are going to wait atleast for 3 more years.|`|ZfoU2lNJaa	I don't plan on trying for 1 1/2-2 years. I want some time between my kids, but not a lot. My personal opinion though! My cousin is having her third baby next month and all three kids will be under 3 years old. CHAOS if you ask me!!|`|iwtetdBoaa	i got pregant with my 2nd when my first ine was 21 months old and when my 2nd was  3 monthd old i got pregnant<br>  <br>  planed all 3 <br>  <br>  mom to  3 & half yr old<br>  13 month old son<br>  2 week & 3 day year old daughter<br>  love the way i did it :)  <br>  go for it :)|`|OlISdLbtaa	I waited 3 years<br>  I had a boy and then 3 years later a girl|`|xGlqXMRAaa	I think it really depends on the couples circumstances. If you have the time and are economically stable enough you can do it right away, but if you don't feel like your quite there yet, I would wait at least a year to two years.  Also you have to think about your current baby, their is a lot to being a new parent give yourself time to adjust and enjoy your first kiddo. At the end of the day if you think that you want a baby now than talk it over with your husband and if both agree than go for it. Hope this helps! Good luck if you go for it!|`|5YVSX6Ggaa	I have been wondering the same thing. My son is 6 months old today and my husband and I have been thinking about trying to concieve again now. I was thinking people would think we are nuts but i want my kids to be close in age and grow up together. Good luck with your decision!|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	I think it just depends on the couple, when you feel like you're up to it then I say go for it my boys will be 2 yrs and 2months apart.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	when the first was potty trained, i tried for the second  that was the sign that he was growing up and didn't need me as much so I could focus on the baby|`|Eh4f4wXcaa	i dont have any children as yet, but i think my sister-in-law has the record for this one.... she has 3 children aged 18months, 9 months and 2 weeks old....|`|G766dQjtaa	5 yrs, only b/c he was never home due to deployments.|`|rBwaAiYRaa	Two hours.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	I started getting the urge around 8 months although know that realistically I'm not ready. We are waiting until our son is 2 1/2yrs old.|`|VR9KhbEgaa	I would wait until the first one is close to a year old. I never waited or even TTC it just happened the last 2 times and it was a lot sooner then I planned! My youngest boys are 15 months and 4 months and I am 12 weeks pregnant again...I even got an IUD this time and still got pregnant the first month I had it in! My older kids are 9,7,6,&5. So yeah I am CRAZY! This time I am gonna opt for that tubal & pray it is more effective then the pill and the IUD! The 2 year gap with the first two was a great age difference for me.
K2jT1z5jaa	it sounds like its left over blood. Brown blood is old blood. but do take a test since sex occured.<br>  It does lower the chance since it was protected & you are on the pill. It can always happen. But it doesntsound like pregnancy to me. but everyone is differnt. Take a test though<br>  <br>  God bless x|`|AA10241491	Some people get a little dark discharge at ovulation.  It is not abnormal.  If you had your period 2 weeks ago it is very unlikely that you are pregnant if you are using two forms of birth control correctly.<br>  <br>  You should expect to get your period 13-14 days from when this started.
c4e0f4398cbb2577d252628c76d0781baa	My daughter does that too.  She is also 7 months.  I even posted a question about it about a week or so ago:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Auz1nh6Qa6aoZYBksHRn86744gt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090220204849AAFteZK">http://sg.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a><br>  <br>  Funny though since I posted the question she doesn't do it as much, but still once every couple of days.  I think it's all normal really....just depends on the baby I guess!|`|mAJZFmIEaa	My 4 month old does the same thing.. i try the bottle and she won't take it then i try the binkie n she won't take it then give her a minute and she will settle on her own.. Dr said that some babies dream about being born and it's traumatic for them|`|50fDeNWXaa	Yea my son did the same thing. He probably started around the same age also. He is 13 months now. I thought it was night terrors so I started asking the doctor and everything. Well it could be just teeting coming in or gas. Mostly likely the doctor told me it was not night terrors. My son will still do it to this day during the night. I won't go pick him up anymore cause he can soothe himself better without me in there. I seem to just wake him up even more. My advice is he is fine and just let him be. If he gets hysterical for sure go in there and comfort him. You'll get used to it and now I hardly even notice it when I hear him on the monitor. I hope this helps, but don't worry, its completly normal. You can always ask your doctor to double check.|`|GNLYxY7kaa	awwww thats not fun =-( sorry to hear that. i sometimes think the same thing about my son who is also 7 months. he will whine then wake up crying. sometimes he wakes up startled and when he realizes im next to him he passes back out. i think they may have scary dreams just like us. he will be ok though, he has you mommy|`|nyuB4POqaa	yes my daughter does that soemtimes in her sleep<br>  i don't think it's anything serious, probably just a bad dream
5ItOGyVHaa	you can contact the company directly and there is a chance they will send a new part. they do not have to, but some company's have great customer service. <br>  <br>  mine was like that, it played whinny the pooh. i broke it. but i figured he was old enough to be with out it so i didn't bother. i did open it up and take a look to see if i could fix it. but couldn't figure out why it wasn't working. <br>  <br>  you might also find a new/used one at a good price at the thrift store or on craiglist.|`|LuVV5q2Xaa	Check the companies website that made the mobile. They should have replacement parts for sale, or you could contact them and see if it's possible for you to order a replacement part. If you don't have any luck with that, you could search on ebay.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	Return it for a new one.|`|n6XYYyoLaa	if u can't get the manufacturer you would probably have to replace it; however, my dd now is 8 mos old and has figured out how to grab it, so i have to take ours down; it may not be worth buy another one; basically i paid forty dollars for something to look cute and that's about it...|`|oXIYHsDaaa	Unless you can contact the manufacturer directly and they are willing to send you a new part, I think you will have to buy a new one.

My son also has a Simpsons game and some driving ones for the xbox that him and his dad play together.  We have spent a small fortune on game systems and games but it has been worth it and is something the whole family enjoys.|`|hVVALFAPaa	I used to play the games with my kids. Many kids obsess over the games and that is all they talk about. I wanted to have a 'link' with them so I started playing too. It gives us something in common to talk about even though I am totally hopeless with most of them.<br>  <br>  Through the years, we have played most of the Pokemon games, Tetris, Mario Kart, Guitar Hero, and lots of Wii games.|`|Iv8WwN2gaa	i do. me and my son play halo on the 360,wrestling  on the PS3.<br>  we do all sports game cause we are a atlethic familyy. cause my son plays sports in real life. my daughter and her friends play singstar.|`|bdWO9wSAaa	My dad sometimes plays wii sports and mariokart with me and my sister.|`|SEzIkGNiaa	My dad loves playing Galaga with us, and my mom loves playing Tetris!|`|SnQvsOPwaa	I never got into video games.|`|GYoNyoWtaa	Well I don't have children old enough to play video games.

She took it over about a year ago and we have gotten her some games. She plays Madagascar2 and Sorry and a few others.<br>  When we go to my mothers we play Wii bowling and my wife and I have talked about using our birthdays (both in may) to buy a Wii and a couple games that she would like. A friend of mine has one that you play on a mat and you have to row a canoe and run thru an obstacle course. My daughter LOVES to be active so this is the best game for her. BUT given the choice she would rather be outside running thru the sprinkler or at Sea World in the water park. When we go to sea world in the summer she says the shows are for people who can not swim ... We had just gotten in line for the water park and a show was starting in 5 minutes so I asked her which she wanted to do. EVERYONE who could hear her comment started to laugh and she just sat on my shoulders and smiled.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	I am the one playing the games. I am seventeen and my oldest is two.

LDiBjNf5aa	It's completely normal. In early pregnancy, it happens because you have more fluids in you and more blood pumping, creating more urine. Later on in pregnancy, it'll happen because the baby is pressing up against your bladder.

Some reason I have to pee when I stand up or walk around.  Sometimes I go to the bathroom and nothing happens!!!  It is so annoying|`|4D1VEKW5aa	It normal, i get up 2-3 times at night to pee.|`|jYPeis3Saa	its normal. get used to it. it only gets worse later into your pregnancy|`|D6muTKc6aa	Yes it is normal to pee a lot during Pregnancy, but just go see your Dr to get a urine test done to be sure you do not have any sort of infection. Have the DR take a look at you, tell him you wanted to be safe.  He will totally understand, that is what he is there for.    Good luck to you and your precious baby.|`|kNpTrBoQaa	lol...yes...im about 33 weeks and i've recently found that my body is confused, im always dehydrated and once i finally catch up on my hydration im constantly in the bathroom....|`|apUkTo3maa	YOU MIGHT HAVE A BLADDER INFECTION. ASK HIM TO TEST YOU FOR IT.|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	YES!! Its totally normal. Earlier in my pregnancy I peed alot more. Lately I havnt been peeing as much but still alot more then I used too. Its a pregnant thing lol. Enjoy:)
EyKJ737daa	Sweetie, they all sound like common pregnancy symptoms and typical at 9 weeks pregnant.  Congratulations sweetie! With the peeing though, you may want to get it checked out and start taking a glass of cranberry juice everyday to help with urinary track health.  Otherwise rest sounds very normal. Yes I still have baby brain- hence why I carry my diary around with me as part of my phone provided I don't forget to pick up my mobile when I go out!! Yep I still forget things and my youngest is now 17 months.  Don't worry about the non tender/swollen boobs hunny, that's still to come! It will happen :-)  The ovary pain is actually your uterus "yanking" and pulling down on the ovaries making them painful as things stretch.  I use to say the baby was yanking on my ovaries and trying to gain control!  Later on though you'll have lots of fun while they get their foot caught up under your rib and they run out of room while trying to do a full body stretch, that's uncomfortable, definitely don't miss that part of pregnancy but I just loved the feeling of them moving and kicking and especially the hiccups.  All things you have to look forward to sweetie.  All the very best and have a wonderful trouble free pregnancy.  xx|`|A1IisrUraa	Some of them symptoms sound normal but then again some don't. i would definately call your doctor, and maybe make an appointment to see her/or him. Better safe than not !|`|jVjInjjiaa	Well I got all day any time sickness the whole 91/2 months I was pregnant and all the other stuff is normal except the peeing part it sounds like u may be starting a bladder infection which is perfectly normal when ur pregnant but u should ask ur doc to make sure its not that...<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, and if u run into any other questions just e-mail me I have 2 little ones<br>  <br>  By the way u r not forgetful or becoming deaf its just ur lack of concentration due to the pregnancy stress and hormones.|`|6tqALbYeaa	I'm 27 weeks pregnant and I have to urinate every 5 mins. Or at least I think so anyway. 9 weeksa pregnant and having morning sickness is normal u can have it throughtout the pregnancy I have it on and off. I do forget a lot now and I had a good memory b4 my pregnancy.  My boobs doesn't hurt but my nipples are soo tender and I sometimes turn food away|`|D6muTKc6aa	Hi, You should call your Dr for an appointment, some of those things sound like a typical Pregnancy others do not,  you should go to be sure you do not have an infection of some sort, especially with the itching and urine frequency like that.   I know Pregnancy is bliss isn't it... What we go through.   Well worth it though in the end.   I wish you the best.    God Bless !
CJkrXeDgaa	you can use a carpet cleaning machine that dampens the upholstery and then sucks the water and dirt out...unfortunately, mattresses are pretty hard to get completely clean once soiled.<br>  Best to be preventative with mattress pads or even a rubber sheet.|`|9a375ef442c198cfdcc3e428c5267f16aa	Punishing your child for wetting the bed is not the right solution no matter how angry you might feel.   Not all children learn to control their bladders at a set age. We dealt with this problem with my daughter.  She could not wake herself up that is how deep her sleep was.  Believe me, it was frustrating and I washed the sheets daily.  The best choice is to cover the mattress with plastic liner or cover, pads,  extra blankets or use pull up undergarments at night.  If you are really desperate and the age is appropriate, you can purchase a bed alarm. <br>  <br>  Like the others said here, you probably won't be able to get deep down into the mattress but you should be able to surface clean.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	It's always best to put plastic under the sheet while the kids are going through this stage, the mattress can wreak even after its been washed and put out on the line.<br>  <br>  Edit response - No! Just let him have his last drink with dinner, that way he will pee most of it out before bed and should wake up dry.|`|xbzCxo8yaa	It's usually stained for good however can be cleaned so that it doesn't smell and no you should not beat the kid..................according to the age................set a limit on what time he/she can have something to drink..........such as if bedtime is 8pm make sure the kid has nothing to drink after 7pm and uses the bathroom right b4 going to bed|`|q1y7kgnEaa	put plastic over the bed, when i was younger, i wet the bed, my parents sometimes just cut open a trash bag and put it under the sheets as a temp solution till they could get the plastic...my daughter now wets the bed, i am getting her on the medicine i was on as a kid, if they are over 6, u can get the medicine for them, sometimes they cant wake up in the middle of the night if they are hard sleepers, my daughter didnt have any problems with it until this past year, and then she started it, sometimes stress can do it, if u have moved recently, or for any other reason, one thing for sure, its not their fault, dont punish them for it....that will just make it worse, there is nothing u can do about something they have no control over while their sleeping....its going to be nearly impossible to get the stain and smell out completely, u can try some air freshener, we put baby powder on our daughters bed and then put the sheet on it....also, we put her to sleep, and then right before we go to bed, we will wake her up and take her potty, sometimes we will wake up in the middle of the night and take her potty...sometimes its just because they sleep to hard for their bodies to wake them up.... if u wake your child up enough times, it might help him/her to get up in the middle of the night....also, have your child help clean up, take the sheets to the laundry, help make the bed, and such, depending on the age, i dont know how old your child is....check out these sites...hope this helps, if u need to know anything else about it, i might be able to help u, feel free to message me on yahoo, my screen name is mommyoftwo20...good luck...|`|sgcxvM3Jaa	No but if you know someone with carpet cleanning / uppholstery cleanning equipment or have a way of renting one you can clean it that way, but be careful not to saturate the bed. I know this because My husband and I own a carpet cleanning business|`|VfjkIZ1gaa	eesh... i wish i had the answer to this... <br>  <br>  my solution is to cover it with plastic sheet or a pad before an accident happens....<br>  <br>  my son's mattress is ruined because the "accident" soaked through the whole thing....|`|ZcrsqMbcaa	rent a shampooer with upholstery attachments|`|ELbs3Dpwaa	Buy an enzyme treatment from the laundry section.<br>  This will eliminate odor and break down the urine. <br>  The stain will remain.<br>  <br>  Spray it on generously.<br>  Tip the mattress sideways so that it can air out and leave this way until it is completely dry.  Use a fan to speed the process.<br>  <br>  Buy a waterproof mattress protector.  They come in cheap vinyl and nicer cloth versions.  Both work.

wqchA8B7aa	If the conception itself was pretty rowdy, it could be just a few minutes.<br>  <br>  aww. Down votes? Wasn't that just a little funny?|`|cTsb7vFjaa	2 weeks for me! It was my first symptom looking back|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I am 5 weeks +6 days and i am extremly tired. Although i think it may be more because my 1 year old wakes 4-6 times every night, and i am now suffering from insomnia. Most pregnancy symptoms are starting to develop around the 6 week mark. Good luck...|`|kDftsHXjaa	i was miserably tired 6 weeks after i found out if was preg, and i found out at 4 weeks.|`|Lprtz2A9aa	Almost immediately. That was one of the first signs I was pregnant and I found out 3 weeks into my pregnancy. I took so many naps and went to bed early more times than I could count.|`|HM0cxcahaa	8 weeks for me|`|uSatSrVOaa	I was tired the entire first trimester, even before I knew I was pregnant. The second trimester I had a lot more energy, but with my belly growing, it was getting a little more difficult to get to my classes on the third floor of the older buildings on campus. :P Then I was wore out again the third trimester... So I would say that it really depends on the person and how your body deals with it. Most women can expect to be tired for the majority of their first trimester, but some don't notice any major changes in their body until later on when they are getting that bump.|`|POs5TeUDaa	i'd say i was about 3-4 weeks pregnant when i got suuper supper tired, i had no clue and thought i was simply being lazy. :/ i slept for about 12 hours a day and sometime around 6 or so i'll get all tired and sleepy again...|`|OathnQfXaa	As soon as within a few weeks.  Your body is doing SO much work at the beginning of your pregnancy that it really wears you out, even though you can't tell it's all going on.|`|NbgxNAYZaa	Couple weeks. Then you just get feeling more and more and more tired.  At first it is hard to think of that little being growing and living inside you as a microscopic human and not just a parasite!|`|9bz6EpoLaa	its diff. for everybody, but that was also my first symptom around 1-2 weeks. couldnt do anything but sleep!|`|QJDbG1F1aa	It varies. I noticed about 2 months later.|`|LBg4DNpCaa	I would say I started feeling tired between 8-10 weeks|`|QAmgy7oXaa	it was like a week maybe less!  good luck!|`|eS7iQCziaa	About two weeks after you conceived. I loved when I was tired, I use to get the best sleep. Go to sleep at seven or eight pm and wake up the next morning feeling refreshed. I am in my second trimester now and go to sleep around nine or ten. Just be thankful you body is getting the rest it needs.

ZfoU2lNJaa	Was 2 weeks ago in the middle of your cycle? Because you can only get pregnant if you were ovulating. I'd say the chances are pretty low, especially since you are on birth control and he pulled out. Even he got some in you I'd say you're ok. You'll know soon though!|`|AA11920812	If he pulled out and your on the pill your chances are very slim. It is true the average woman (with a 28 day cycle) ovulates on day 15 (middle of the cycle). But, not every woman does. And, if you aren`t keeping track there is no way to know. Honestly, don`t fret about it.<br>  <br>  My husband and I had a scare like that before we were married. He totally freaked and was not ready at all. But, like I said a few weeks later we realized it was all in vain. After that, he became very faithful with condoms ;P<br>  <br>  EDITED to add:<br>  <br>  Its likely you are not pregnant. I am an early ovulator and my doctors always inform me that I am the rare type. Also, it takes more than ONE sperm to get pregnant. Please. LMAO. It takes a few thousand just to empail the egg...and thousands more to actually fertalize it. One spem...that`s so 7th grade sex education!!|`|LTD0qL6Yaa	I have 4 beautiful daughters and am newly pregnant with # 5. Appart from my 1st daughter (the best accident in my life) all of my other pregnancies were planned. I have been on birth control in between each child and i have never fallen pregnant while on birth control. When i am on birth control i take my pill at the same time every night and i have never forgotten. You are not pregnant if you use the pill correctly.  I hope this helps..|`|HFWLYMD6aa	Take it from me a devoted pill user for many years. You shouldn't worry so much. You take it everyday. chances you'll get pregnant are like 1%. The only protection me and my partner use is the pill. I've missed one here and there to on occasion. No pregnancy.|`|L3NA7Ywnaa	im guessing he didnt have a condom on ,but because youre on bc i think you might be okay...right now is too early to tell what about another 2 weeks and take a HPT and wait it out for 3 day intervals in taking other tests if theyre neg... then no worries<br>  i dont think you are pregnant but if it continues to bother you check it out|`|xFK4Ajroaa	if you think you are and care about your potential child please stop taking your birth control until you are sure.  and don't have sex in the meantime in case you aren't so you don't BECOME because school is important!<br>  <br>  best of luck!|`|q0Ju2pO2aa	50% chance of getn pregnant birth control pills dont always work just a lil *** can get you pregnant so if i were you id watch your self very carefully and if u see your period wierd or anything wierd id make and apt with a doctor|`|G766dQjtaa	The pull out method does not work, and the pill is not 100%. You are just going to have to wait until you get your period to be sure.|`|AHjFCGgsaa	<a href="http://www.bestoften.com/top-ten-pregnancy-symptoms/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bestoften.com/top-ten-pregnan...</a>|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Can't tell from the information provided.  Chart your cycle and see if you were ovulating at that time.  Usually 10 days or so after the first day of your last period if you menstruate regularly.  Take a HPT if your period comes late.  Good Luck|`|7xit1ogxaa	Depends on if you were close to ovulation or not. It doesn't matter whether he pulled out quickly or not. Pre-ejaculate contains sperm and it only takes one sperm to become pregnant. Take a test if you miss a period.<br>  <br>  Edit: Oh, I missed the part about the birth control. If you take correctly your chances of becoming pregnant are less than 1%. If birth control is taken correctly a woman should not ovulate. No birth control is 100% effective so it wouldn't be a bad idea to use condoms in addition to your pills.
F8iyUqJBaa	I was 35 weeks and they had to do brain surgery on me to remove a tumor.  They told me they could do the surgery with him inside me, but I didn't feel comfortable or right about that, so they induced me and my son was in the NICU while I was in the ICU|`|AA11994092	You would be amazed at the way they can do sugary now WITHOUT cutting you open. When my husband had his appendix removed they only had to make 3 Tiny slits and used a scope. When I had to have a perforated ulcer sugary,no cutting at all,they went down my throat into my stomach with a Camera and a Lazer and plugged the hole. when I had to have sugary on my left kidney for scar tissue,they did it with YES again a robot Camera. So yes it is not nearly as dangerous to have sugary while pregnant now as it used to be.|`|575w52loaa	They do surgery on pregnant women all the time... the doctors are not going to do anything that may harm an unborn baby without fully informing the mother of the risks.  They fix women's apendix when they are pregnant.. i remember my doctor telling me about a pregnant woman with a morphine pump...the mother metabolizes most of the medication so that the baby doesn't get much..|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	well... i mean you are not suppose to go under anesthesia while you are pregnant..... it can kill the baby... if it was a true emergency, life or death, they would probably do it anyway. if not, you would have to sign a consent form to use it, otherwise i would imagine they would not use any and you would have to endure the pain.... or maybe they would give an epideral? good question!|`|iMULlxdgaa	a fruebd= of mine needed her appendix removed while she was like 8 months with her daughter...it can happen and if its something that threatens the life of the mother they will weigh their options, sometimes they need to wait and induce like with another friend with a kidney problem and she had to be induced at 35 weeks so they could do the surgery on her.  but sometimes they can do the surgery while the baby is still there.  Actually they had no choice but to do the surgery on the first friend becuase her appendix exploded so there was no time to nduce,  both cases turned out fine for  the babies and they are doing great , one is 6 years old now and the other is already a  few months!
R4NDgifmaa	u might be ovulating now..u should try..if ur period went off on the 19th u usuallly ovulate 3 days after ur period goes off..look on the computer put in ovulation calendar or calculator..it should help..but me i dont go by the charts becuz i did last year in the same day my period went off i became prego..so the charts dont work for me ovulation is very tricky...ive did alot of research in when u ovulatiing ur cevical mucus is really slippery lik egg yok...not creamy in whitte but slippery in it stretches..hope this works
xFK4Ajroaa	There is a good chance it will.  Although I am the same way!!  <br>  <br>  I know several families who have shy parents and their kids are too shy.

I am afraid of so many things it's ridiculous.  Every time I talk to a person I kind of freak out afterwards.  I just feel like such an idiot or something because I say things wrong, or can't think of much to talk about.  I'm trying to "fake it til I make it" for my son's sake.  I just keep telling myself that it's for him.  I use him as a main focus for my conversations.  Mommy groups seem like a good idea.  I've been to one le leche league meeting & it wasn't so bad.  maybe joing a mommy & me class or something so the focus will be on an activity & everyone will have something in common to talk about.  good luck : )
SSFy8eHNaa	Go get an ID and go through medicaid.<br>  You can get an ID even if you do not have a driver's license.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Just go down to the DMV and get a ID card made.  You don't have to have a driver's license, they can get you a legal photo ID.  It costs next to nothing and then apply again for medicaid.  Problem solved.|`|tMl7GjqTaa	ur  gonna be paying out the *** in hospital bills|`|TIy7c7Vlaa	Get your ID.  If you can't do that ask your Drs. office to work out a payment plan for you.  Your local hospital or health dept also has social workers that can help you find someone to care for you and your baby while you are pregnant.  I had mu first son wile uninsured and didn't go on aid I just paid the dr and hospital in installments, and I got great care.|`|ki5hZbcTaa	just go to the secretary of state and get an ID card. It's not a driver's license, just something to identify you. You also need your social security card. Medicade will take you if you're pregnant, no matter what.|`|3p0QBNpwaa	Why don't you just go get an ID?|`|D6muTKc6aa	Go get ID and get the medicaid, they will also cover bills three months back.   You can also contact a social worker at a local hospital, they can guide you as to how to get the medicaid. If there is a specific reason you can't get some sort of ID.  Talk to a nurse in the ER about this they will guide you to a social worker or where you can go for help.  A social worker can also act as an advocate for you with case workers, Also, Planned parenthood can be of some help too I am sure, call them as well, they may be able to give you direction.    You still should be able to go see a Dr, you are Pregnant and they should not be able to refuse you.   Tell them that medicaid is pending.   Call to get an appointment as soon as possible,  tell them you are five months and have not been seen.  Once the insurance kicks in it will cover past bills, so don't worry.   Good Luck to you and your beautiful Baby.|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	Honey, you need to go get an ID. It will not be difficult. Just call your DMV...or look it up online, it will tell you all the info to bring with you to get an ID. I'm not being rude but if you are too lazy to do that you probably don't need a baby. You are gonna have to also get it put on medicaid when its born. Then you are gonna have to take it to the pediatrician at 1 week, 2mo,4mo,6mo,9mo, 12mo,15mo,18mo,2yo then yearly after that and thats just for well check ups. You will be there alot more for sick visits. Please think this through like an adult. You need to do whatever you have to do to take care of this child....GET AN ID!!!!|`|0IFBS2iQaa	You can easily check your minimal health care rates in internet, for example here - healthquotes.awardspace.info
kjgonYlgaa	Welcome to the terrible twos... (they last until they're 10 by the way).<br>  Remain consistent with your punishments, you sound like you're doing the right things and you're right not to spank him,  he's definitely too young to understand that!  Taking favourite toys seems to be working with my five year old, who thankfully didn't get to the terrible two's stage until she started school.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	This is the time for punishments like time outs, stick through with them and let him know you are the boss.  When he hits you hold his hands to his side and sternly tell him it's not okay to hit mommy, then put him in a time out.  I know that he's your baby and was premature and very fragile in the beginning of his life and that's probably really hard to get past, but he's okay now and he understands everything that you are saying but knows that Mommy is a push over.  <br>  <br>  Show him you are boss now so he won't have too many memories of all of the times outs, and it will just become routine, the law.  Don't cry in front of him and don't let him think he's stronger then you, let him know you are the boss.  Trust me it may seem hard but it's better done now then later.  Good Luck|`|014d65a0c1703f4cec009da9b16a4d9faa	I recommend this book for the families I work with:<br>  Nanny 911 for all your Parenting Emergencies|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	if you dont like spanking, try this-<br>  <br>  when he is bad, make him hold his arms up, straight out to the sides. they get heavy real quick and will stop the tantrum! once they get used to this make them hold something in each hand!<br>  <br>  not only does this work without the guilt of spanking, but it also strengthens their arms :)|`|4iXL4C6paa	I have a 2 1/2 year old and spanking work just fine for us, first I tell her bad behavior will not be tolerated, if she doesn't stop I give her one more warning and let her know she will get spanked and if she continues then yes she gets her butt swatted.|`|0c41ce24c80b3d37eee704863c97bf06aa	all children are different, but the solution is for you to remain the same.  when he throws his tantrum, be very firm and say NO.  if he doesn't listen, put him in his room and leave.  by doing this, you are sending the message that if he doesn't treat his mommy with respect, he loses the privilege of having mommy's attention until he quits.  it may hurt you to "ignore" him, (or at least lead him to believe you are) but you just have to be consistent and firm.  whether you are spanking or not, whatever the punishment, just follow through ALWAYS!  i have a 3 year old, and we are just getting out of that phase.  i had trouble being consistent, but once i did, it made a huge difference in him. <br>  <br>  good luck, and don't worry, this will pass.  the way you handle this problem will affect the rest of his life, so just stay tough :)|`|AA11865529	Do NOT spank him. All you tell him then is that hitting is okay. And tantrums at two are pretty normal, but you have to get control on them.<br>  <br>  Time out is good, but make sure you reward positive behavior with praise, hugs, I'm so proud of you's, etc. He isn't too young for a chart where he gets a star or something for doing positive things, like playing quietly, using his words when he is angry. When he has earns a certain number of stars, let him do something special. Listen to him when he is upset so you can understand what is bothering him. Also, let him help you around the house. He wants to feel important and needed to you.<br>  <br>  When he does the bad behavior, always put him in time out. (one minute per year of age). Consistency is important. You can't just do it sometimes. Make sure he knows why he is in timeout. Make him apologize when he is done, then give him a  hug and tell him you love him. <br>  <br>  Also make sure you give him positive attention. Some kids do that to get attention. So make sure that there is time for just you and him, without fiance. That might be part of his anger, especially if fiance is not his dad. It might confuse him.<br>  <br>  Another thing to do, when he has a tantrum, is to have one back. Jump up and down, say no no no, and wave your arms. It shocks them and you can both have a giggle.<br>  <br>  Also remember, a kid can have a bad day. Sometimes they just need a few minutes of sitting with mom in a rocking chair relaxing. Just don't do that when he is hurting you.|`|UQgkWFg7aa	i can understand how you feel at times i have a 2 1/2 also I think its best to spank him and try talking to him afterward letting him know his behavior is bad maybe he's just spolied only way to handle it is a way that best for since you dont wanna spank you should try other methods|`|0ky4TktEaa	Your fiance and family are right. It's been time for a spanking. I work in a daycare at the university i go too, so there's older parents but mainly younger parents. It amazes me to see the difference in the discipline between a child how hits his parents and a child who knows better. You don't need to give him a real whipping but he does need a spanking. There is a difference in the two. Make it age appropriate. No light taps; a smack/swat on the behind or back of the legs works just fine. You'll learn how hard it needs to be for him to respond; all kids are different.<br>  <br>  I remember when i was little. I never had an issue about hitting/biting my mother. She would've laid me flat, 2 years old or not. Some things you do not do; allowing your child to hit you now will makes things much worse for you later. Give the child a spanking. Yes you are lucky he's alive; however, he still needs to be disciplined or you'll have an unruly brat on your hands.|`|RTZuaN3Eaa	I am having the exact same problem, and I have used all the resorts I could. My son is 27 months, and timeouts, spankings, removing toys away, nothing works...I know EXACTLY how you feel. Does he do these kind of things to your fiance as well? All I can say from my own nightmare experiences with the hitting and freaking out is when I ttalk to him like an adult he seems to listen a little bit better than when raising my voice or punishing him...stick with it hun...it's just a natural phase of a growing boy.....|`|TVqXrOq2aa	I agree with the cheeseless wonder<br>  <br>  I have a 2 year old and when she is misbehaving she gets a time out. Time outs should be 1 minute for each year of their age. After the time out, talk to them and explain, " Mommy doesn't like when you hit her, it hurts. Hands are for clapping, not hitting." Make him say he is sorry and give you a hug. Let your child know that hitting, back talking, not listening, etc. will not be tolerated. First warning, Second, warning of timeout, 3rd, Timeout.  Sometimes my 2 daughter gets so excited or mad or whatever that i put her in her crib for a minute to cool down and I leave the room. I will go back in a minute or two and ask her if she is done crying and if she wants to come out. When she stops, i let her out and we have the talk that we have after a timeout.  I always ask her "What do you say to Mommy?" And she says sorry and we hug.|`|Tr4Vj7RIaa	A swat on the butt will not hurt him it will only hurt his feelings.  Since this is not an option you want to use I will try to give you another option.  <br>  1st instead of telling him what not to do try telling him what you expect of him, example:  instead of don't hit mommy try telling him to touch mommy nice and take his hand and touch it softly to your face while telling him soft or gentle.  That way he learns how to be soft/gentle when he touches you.<br>  2nd set up a safe time out area like a pack and play or his crib, get an egg timer and if he continues to hit you and pull your hair tell him "that hurts mommy" and put him in time out and set the egg timer for 1 1/2 minutes.  The general rule for time out is 1 min. per year of age but since he is developmentally delayed I would go with a little less time.  <br>  Do not talk to him or yell at him while he is in time out.  Negative attention is still attention.<br>  When he gets out of time out you might tell him that he has to be gentle but basically he starts over with a clean slate.<br>  Most importantly be consistent.|`|YwWOvI70aa	As much as it is a pain in the butt to keep having to sit him out for time out (because sometimes they keep gettingo out of their chair), I would keep doing that.  Spanking should be a last resort, you don't want it to be a frequent type of punishment that they'll become immune to because once that fails, what are you going to do?  Trying stamping his hand when he does something good, my 3yr old loves the stamps.  You might also want to talk to him in terms he will understand.  I don't know how you explain to your child when he does something wrong, but you might want to say good boys don't hit mommy, or your doing so good sitting nice and quiet....this way it becomes part of their language and they can begin to understand.  Also, if it's something that's not terribly horrible that will hurt him, don't let him know your paying attention to the behavior.  He'll love the attention, good or bad, that you give him.  My little one loved to hit his head when he didn't get his way, so I did what our doctor said and would watch him from the corner of my eye so he wouldn't know.  He quickly stopped that behavior.
vQ8XPXsdaa	Alycia Lyn is BEAUTIFUL!! <br>  <br>  The spelIing of Lyn is actually the proper way of spelling it and it looks great -- I don't know what people are talking about. I love the spelling of Alycia too. <br>  <br>  Congrats & God Bless!|`|Ei1TcLclaa	It's an adorable name!! I think it's really special that you used your boyfriend's great grandmother's name. My aunt and uncle used family names for their first girl, and are using family names for their to-be-born-on-monday girl. I love how people do that. Alycia is a pretty name, and the spelling on it is really cute. I have to say that I've never seen it spelled like that, but I've seen it spelled Alicia and it's one of my favorite names!!<br>  Good Luck!!<br>  <3 Kryssah|`|T6H5r54Aaa	I prefer Alicia. I see why you wouldn't want to change "Lyn" because of the ancestor.<br>  <br>  Incidentally, why are you seeking opinions if your mind is set?|`|xVEqBjDVaa	I thin Alicia Lyn would be prettier looking.|`|DAFOuvEDaa	I like it and I like the spelling.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	It's very pretty! Just the way you have it spelt too, no need to change it.|`|9WovIk3maa	Very cute|`|E6CShQfKaa	LOVE IT!|`|qlKQPUDuaa	To many "y's".|`|2rOQyvaKaa	I prefer Alicia Lynn.|`|d5K8wORqaa	how about Alicia Lyn.<br>  i like it with out all the y's<br>  or Ashlee Lyn. or Jessica Lyn. or Kaylee Lyn.<br>  my favorite is Kaylee then Ashlee then Alicia then Jessica|`|u7UnUZXnaa	are you pronouncing it UH-LEE-SHA or UH-LEE-SEE-UH?<br>  <br>  i prefer UH-LEE-SEE-UH(: but both names are so cute!<br>  i love Lyn as the middle name too.|`|pHIUUnOiaa	aww.... its beautiful wow is that your daughter in your dp shes beautiful good luck with your beautiful little miracle!|`|DP48dIxhaa	Thenn change Alycia..Alicia Lyn..I would change it to Lynn...cause it doesn't really matter if it's spelt the same wayy or not.|`|87WOSjwgaa	I like it. It is unique. It looks like Uh-lee-see-uh tho.
dHkvVlONaa	That same thing happened to me.  I think he's either just a loser player-type guy, or he does like you but there is something that is stopping him.  maybe he thinks you dont like him or something.|`|WVqoLROFaa	just  forget about him.<br>  tdfl|`|l1STgPyRaa	well what do you what him to do god sake you said "He's made attempts to talk to me. I have notihng to say" so he is not wanting to be a stalker and doing as you put it "And now he's completley(sp) ignoring me" is that not what you wanted from him? god sack if you want to have him talk to you then you need to have something to say too and if you don't then his actions are totally inline with what should be done.....<br>  this is why you should not date!|`|NYJgiVxraa	im in a similar situation. a friend and i had feelings for each other, and then i became hurt and needed soem space from him cuz i still had some stronger feelings for him while he is the one that drove me into wanting to date him, and then just stopped. he wasnt sure why i acted a certain way but i told him and then hes like oh i forgive you, you know u just misunderstood what i said. it was cool, and then he just chagned. its messed up. but im like okay dude. whatever. ive done my best trying to handle it, i thought you forgave me cuz that is exactly what you said but obviously not.|`|8sB8ASncaa	Forget him. He sounds like a tool.
CRvdmFwCaa	Probably Alaska... I love it there...

AA10217725	every pregnancy is different and each baby develops individually. i think you are doing fine. I am 12 weeks and i look as if i have put on weight. no noteicable bump as such. god i am dying to start showing. guess have a long way to go. <br>  <br>  good luck to you|`|vewYW4wcaa	I am on the small side, or petite, and I didnt noticeably show till almost 6 months, but then I was all belly and didnt gain anywhere else, very typical 'boy' pregnancy.|`|Vs17ceYKaa	PEOPLE WHO HAVE KIDS ALREADY SHOW QUICKER THAN FIRST TIME MOMMIES CAUSE THERE TUMMY MUSLES ARENT AS TIGHT AS NEWBIES|`|3EiOobEVaa	I started to show around 4 months but everyone is different....You have nothing to worry about|`|FZOONf1caa	I am 21 weeks and I'm barely showing.

Your baby is fine and growing beautifully.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Im 12 weeks and I look like im 5 months. This is my 5th pregnancxy.Havent gained any weight It actually looks like im loosing. I was like this with my last 3 pregnancies which were boys so if I dont miscarry this one like im told i am im sure it will be a boy again! Congrats|`|4yUjAaadaa	i started to show at 5 months. your baby is probably just fine. some people just show later than others. depends on many factors.|`|SSFy8eHNaa	Yea, I didnt show a lot until I was about 6 months pregnant.<br>  Trust me, you will wake up one morning and be huge. LOL|`|HPRlEWu1aa	im 15 weeks and i also have a lil bump .. people that know me notice it but of course stangers wouldnt even guess lol ..|`|giRRCXU4aa	Your baby is fine. I didn't start showing until 25 weeks. It's different with everyone. You definitely couldn't tell I was pregnant at 15 weeks, and now i'm huge.
gjteVB2Daa	Perhaps as a middle name.  Just can't hear other little kids calling her that and what would be the nickname?  Sap or Saf or Fire?  You could name here Jewel if you are thinking something precious.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I would use it as second Anita first|`|776cf4cc9dc31fae3b35bd08e9ead34eaa	For a first name. I love the name Sapphire. Its super beautiful, and unique but not too out there. And you're not trying to change the spelling to Saffyire or something. Its classic in a way. I love it!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	A middle name prolly, but maybe possibly as a first name.  It's a very cute name, i really like it, :D.|`|NNki7qiFaa	I would use it as a middle name.|`|f8epBxFOaa	i would use it as a middle name it is very pretty though|`|8CTNzb6kaa	My brothers daughters name is Sapphire Marie<br>  <br>  Cute|`|WDS2DASnaa	i would use it as a middle name unless you're going to call her 'jewel' which is an amazingly beautiful name.|`|P9k8qHP6aa	I personally would use it as a middle name|`|vR7Bew2Xaa	Either.<br>  It's very pretty for the first or middle name.|`|b1hXdKHCaa	It's very pretty and unique - I would use it as a first name!|`|mA59dkjXaa	I love it!! Really unique i would use it as a first name i think
w5y4BTjkaa	I LOVE Jazmin but I don't like Ivy. Jazmin means Jazmin flower and is of Persian origin. Ivy means Climbling Vine Plant (a little creepy) and is of English origin. I'll give Jazmin Ivy a 2/5. How about:<br>  <br>  Jazmin Snow<br>  Jazmin Dawn<br>  Jazmin Dawndrell<br>  Jazmin Raine<br>  Jazmin Dust<br>  Jazmin Ivory<br>  Jazmin Skyee<br>  Jazmin Rae<br>  Jazmin Paige<br>  Jazmin Grace<br>  Jazmin Zale<br>  Jazmin Rose<br>  Jazmin Trixabelle<br>  Jazmin Rhiannalyn<br>  Jazmin Taylor<br>  Jazmin Zahara<br>  <br>  Top 5 (in order):<br>  Jazmin Trixabelle: 6/5<br>  Jazmin Dawn: 5/5<br>  Jazmin Raine: 5/5<br>  Jazmin Ivory: 4/5<br>  Jazmin Rose: 4/5<br>  <br>  Instead of Jazmin, how about Jazzibelle? If not, I still love Jazmin! I hope I helped and good luck with your little bundle of joy!<br>  <br>  Always,<br>  (-:Tabbykinz:-)|`|Elxuvon8aa	to over used|`|gjteVB2Daa	Jasmine is lovely as it will be nice when she is young and also when she is a grown lady.  However, I would not put Ivy with it--to many plant things.  Marie would be nice for a second name as that sounds so nice together.  Think it needs 2 syllables.|`|PLbmKNpvaa	ARRRRG! DON'T DO IT! <br>  As a person who has two plant names as their first and second names I can GUARANTEE that she'll have the mickey taken out of her for most of her life. I'm not saying they're bad names, just don't put the two together for her sake!|`|vOFdHvlvaa	Jasmine is really cute, Ivy is ok, they do sound kinda cute together though.|`|2TrHH0rkaa	Jasmine Ivy is a great name. Very pretty and flows beautifully :)|`|f8epBxFOaa	i love jasmine if mine is a girl i am going to name her that! i don't like ivy very much. sorry|`|8CTNzb6kaa	I like Jasmine|`|xDaRC63eaa	i like Jasmine Ivory. No, i didnt read your question wrong, but this  sounds nice.<br>  <br>  Jasmine Ivy is really adorable too.|`|AA10463356	I like it very much.  Jasmine might be a little trendy right now but probably not enough to cause the ten-in-the-same-classroom problem.|`|4tlgugviaa	Jasmine Ivory would be very cute!<br>  :)|`|QbOYIixuaa	Jasmine is pretty. Ivy, not soo much. It reminds me of a weed.|`|axylPYftaa	she sounds like a really poisonous plant<br>  wouldnt wanna mess with her|`|OlEnfCo3aa	i lik jasmin|`|ueFBtUmtaa	Jasmine is a very pretty name.
gjteVB2Daa	Don't want to hurt your feelings, but not to keen on either of them.  If it has to be one of them, then go with Lesley.  If you want a first name with A maybe it could be Arlene, Alberta or something.|`|Elxuvon8aa	to me Alloma is horrid Like Lesley   Our last name strts with a L I wanted to use Lesley Leigh L  we had a boy|`|fboC1N7gaa	I personally prefer Alona over Alloma. You could do Alona Lesley or Alona Lynette.|`|oYmZUO8Caa	Alloma is okay. I prefer Paloma.|`|DO3grY10aa	I like Leslie.  I see the first name as "a loma", Spanglish for "a hill".|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	nope don't like it at all, how about Alahna Kelsey|`|8CTNzb6kaa	I like the name Lesley not so much alloma , But if you switch the to it will be a very cute name <br>  <br>  Cognrats|`|OhaosQ14aa	im not a big fan of lesley<br>  but i do think alloma is a really nice name|`|jVjInjjiaa	Why don't u switch them around I think It has a better ring to it
AA10949869	I sure would:) As long as your friend is ok with it I see nothing wrong with it. A neighbor of mine, who passed away 7 years ago at age 92, told me that she was sharing a hospital room with another lady after they had their babies and the woman didn't produce any milk. Back then there was no such thing as formula and the womans baby would have died...but my neighbor had more than enough milk for both babies and offered to feed the womans baby for her. She was so proud to have saved that baby's life, it was cute. Anyway, I say go for it, I'd do it:)|`|AOvtRBU9aa	I was going to give my frozen breast milk to my brother and his wife but they got all picky about it. She only wanted milk for her son that was pumped the same day, not frozen. I'm not going to take fresh milk from my daughter and give her frozen milk instead while I'm at work. I pump and send it off with her to grandparents house.|`|AtLP7QwMaa	me and my friend had our babies a week apart and she could not breastfeed so I pumped for her and her son enjoyed every drop. GOODLUCK I do not see anything wrong with it.|`|TlFnIei0aa	If i had enough breast milk, nd the mother was willing to accept it from me, then yeah I'd do it.|`|y3vozJ8Aaa	if you're comfortable, and you're friend is too.. i don't see a problem in it. it is a unselfish thing to do|`|YCJz2DiWaa	I would do it if I produced enough.|`|aca803aafd407291581b58b9be71df4daa	I would do it if the other mother wanted it.|`|9bz6EpoLaa	yes, people do that. esp for sick infants! If you're both ok with it, go for it!|`|F8iyUqJBaa	Absolutely, that's the way it used to be done and there are lactation stations all over for women to donate or sell their extra milk.  I would for a friend in a heartbeat.  You should also tell your friend to try some herbal teas and remedies that help produce it.  She can look stuff up online, they really do help.|`|n3IoftMFaa	I think it is a great idea - though I would make sure the milk has been cleaned and checked. I would let my baby nurse on another woman if she didn't have like AIDS and other stuff. Wet nurses aren't a new thing at all.<br>  I think it is a great thing - what a great friendship you guys have - that's rare!|`|7SKVCPcSaa	i wouldn't consider "wet nursing" but i would consider "wet pumping". lol, you know what i mean. if i had the extra milk and my child wasn't using it, yes i would try to donate it..<br>  <br>  and if your friend is ok with it, ask her if she would like your assistance.. even if she just does 50/50 breast milk/formula..|`|Qe9rXFm0aa	In the beginning I had tons of milk, and I would have been more than happy to have donated it to another baby.<br>  And also, If I was not physically able  to breastfeed, I would have been very appreciative to take pumped milk from a friend or family member for my daughter.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	I think that's a great idea.  What a good friend u are, :D.  I would def. do this if i was producin enough milk for my baby and enough extra as well, and my friend was willin to accept the help, :D.|`|oDGpmkMaaa	My BFF does this, she gives my cousin who's milk never came in. Preemie baby her overflow breast milk the doc says he's doing better on the breast milk then he was formula. (of coarse!)
6558e1177abb6a029748d359090ee9f9aa	There is no way of knowing.  Either just have sex every other day if you are trying to conceive or use ovulation predictor kits or a Clearblue Fertility Monitor.
7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	You probably have the flu it's spreading like wild fire. It wouldn't hurt to call your doc however it's not necessary you should just get plenty of rest and drink lost of fluids!|`|D6muTKc6aa	You should call your Dr, don't take any medicine at all with out a DR's say so, it could hurt the baby.  The DR needs to know how you are feeling , due to fever, or vomiting.  You could dehydrate or the fever can be serious for the baby.  Call right now, some one will be on call.  Be safe.  Good Luck to you.  Hope you feel better.|`|6tqALbYeaa	Heyy I'm almost 7 months pregnant and I have the same symptoms.. iu should call ur doc like I did b.c he can explain what's going on with u better and if medication is needed he can provide it for u for the health of the baby.|`|qV1afg80aa	yes you should definantly go to a doctor. Been 6 months? yes you should as there might be something seriously wrong. good luck|`|SSFy8eHNaa	I would call, because they can help with letting you know what you can take to make yourself feel better.<br>  When I was pregnant, I had the flu twice...and I never get the flu.<br>  Your immune system is sometimes weaker because you are tired and the baby takes a lot of vitamins and such from you.<br>  Just call, it cant hurt.  Better to be safe than sorry.

VR9KhbEgaa	With all of my pregnancies my veins were very blue and you could see almost every one of them. The ones by my shoulder and armpit are very, very blue and noticeable. My stomach looks like someone drew on me with a blue marker same with the ones going down from my hip to my inner thigh. I am 12 weeks pregnant with my 7th and LAST child, getting my tubes tied this go round since BC has failed me 3 times in 3 years!<br>  <br>  And yes....BABY DUST to all those TTC!|`|MOsStEbqaa	I noticed them showing up more in my arms and armpits. Not really anything new on my belly.|`|0b3222142a6140d50a18e4b471b4f9a0aa	I am having a similar....problem? The veins in my chest, arms, hands, and stomach are much more visable... my doctor warned me that it would happen, she said its due to increased blood flow and volume|`|f4AJHCHKaa	My veins are way more noticeable in my arms and boobs. Its crazy!! I dont really notice them anywhere else though.
E2UXN7J1aa	According to my doctor it is perfectly fine as long as I am comfortable and not in any pain. Honestly it still scares me to do it sometimes so I try to fall asleep on my side, but I ALWAYS wake up on my tummy. I'm just naturally a tummy sleeper. Doctor told me not to worry though that baby is safe in there and I am not squishing him at all. Sooo...no worries. <3 Good luck.<br>  <br>  ---<br>  <br>  I tend to sleep exactly how the person above me explained. It's comfortable and I don't feel like I am squishing him so much!|`|K2jT1z5jaa	darling. doctors say its okay to do this. But definitely not after 24 weeks. although ive read that its better not to and to sleep on your left side as it helps the blood flow around baby and you. & also that your belly is grwing out that way.<br>  <br>  Baby isnt getting squashed but it would be better not to do this.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|apUkTo3maa	THATS A NEGATIVE DO NOT LAY ON HIM.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Sometimes you will fall asleep on your side and wake up on your stomach b/c your body still does what is natural.<br>  Eventually, the big bump will keep you from rolling over anymore. So, try to go ahead and get used to sleeping on your side.  PILLOWS! Prop them anywhere you need to stay comfortable.|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Try to lay with your legs in like a "4" position, like on your belly but one leg bent up towards your belly...if that makes sense, you could put a pillow under that leg too, thats what i do.  My doc said its okay, just not to lay flat on your tummy.  I can't wait to sleep on my belly again!|`|BU3A3rR4aa	im 31 weeks and i can still lay on my stomach ... it dosnt bother her and dosnt bother me !|`|QIUCmRFoaa	The baby is well protected.  Its more a matter of what you're comfortable with (blood flow, etc).  If you start to feel uncomfortable on your stomach, your body will quickly let you know.  I've just started getting uncomfortable on my stomach at 23 weeks...|`|6PEOqeLOaa	i wouldnt lay on your stomach anymore....i know what you mean about the temptation i was the same way but if you can feel him/her i would not risk it lay on your side!!|`|LbwpUA1caa	Commonly we tell people that they can lay on their stomach as long as it is comfortable.  You are not squishing him.
0b4c93bbeb71c27f7f5c6e0c009bc154aa	Yes - I think they should be restricted to after 10pm.<br>  But that also goes for all the TV sitcoms that are filled with sexual innuendos from start to finish.|`|veO1RXrCaa	When my son was practically a baby and he was toddling or crawling around the living room he would always stop and watch this one "viagra" commercial.  It had those freaky couple with the really large toothy smiles.  It was weird.  He would hear the music and crawl/walk over and was fascinated by it.  But I think they should be more discreet in their advertising anyhow.|`|atPuxNiFaa	i think that they should like totally remove that stuff.... no one wants to see that ew! im gettings ick just thinking about a kid watching that! and then if the kid ask "wat is that" u have to be like "um umma ill tell u when u get older" i hate it when i parents used to tell me that! just take that crap off|`|Z0KQenm9aa	it seems to me that a more appropriate time would be better.|`|E6Wjfh0Naa	Depends when they advertise, meaning time. lil kids intend to watch tv after schools, they shouldn't advertise much at those times. They should usually advertise in the late afternoon- night time because most adults intend to watch television most of the times at night|`|jvjziDGeaa	I think so personally|`|OI3bf4yjaa	Most kids who watch television that have commercials like those, understand them. They're eventually going to hear things like that and probably MUCH worse things at school. The kids who are younger won't understand them, therefore it wouldn't be much of a concern of mine. And the younger kids usually watch channels made for children, and adult commercials aren't played on those channels.|`|a9YfUGzSaa	Most KIDS are watching tv during the day, don't know many kids shows on during primetime.
OTTZyCKuaa	I like them after all don't listen to these people its your decision to name your BABY its yours not theirs...|`|0C5TBPEvaa	Baby names should be the farthest thing from your mind!|`|AuqZZBHjaa	Yikes!  Hopefully your tastes change in the next 15 years!!!!|`|yCtzMvt2aa	more than half of these names sound like some kind of 3rd world diseases|`|Elxuvon8aa	You have plenty of time to change your mind|`|IN7xvFqdaa	im sorry but if u name ur kids like that theyll hate you. oh and sora is "hooker" in spanish. so yeah no. lol i wanted that name too. haha|`|vOFdHvlvaa	For girls i like Kairi, it's cute, the rest are def. a bit on the weird side lol.  <br>  For boys i really like Axel, i think it's adorable, the other 2 are def. weird, lol.  <br>  The unisex name is weird too, lol.  <br>  The names are def. a bit on the weird side but if u like them then that's all that matters.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|r5CttpsFaa	Are you japanese or something?|`|LJkPRqN0aa	yeah...hun youll have plenty of time to change your mind cuz those are just not names that are good.....i think its time to lay off the anime for a while....|`|udVdQSchaa	Haha, well I'm guessing you play Kingdom Heart. (My little brother plays that too).<br>  <br>  Kairi is my favourite.
IU4uNH97aa	Of course you will no matter how different you guys might be from each other your always going to be brothers. When he grows up he will probably not be as immature.<br>  <br>  My oldest brother is 34 now and my youngest twin sisters are 16 between them are 8 other siblings there is 11 of us in total. As much of an age difference between all of us and how different we seemed as kids now that I am older we are very close with each other. The older siblings share their experiences with the the younger ones.|`|HofRUVKyaa	My sisters 20 years and im 14 so i guess im at where your going to be in 2 years.<br>  <br>  Yeah i never really had a duffy love relationship with my sister, but now and then when she comes home from college we hang out go to the stores and stuff and i help her with computers. <br>  <br>  Its very possible for you to hang out with him. But you have to be accepting.|`|welQ5nSqaa	It's very possible, I turn 18 in a few months and my brother turns twelve, and I can already see him maturing, and I don't live with him so I think it will make us closer now cause I haven't been around.|`|fFoMiIbgaa	Yes, when he gets about 15 he'll be more fun to be around and you'll have a lot more in common.|`|cN9sOZfDaa	me & my brother are 10 years apart. we always used to hang out when i was little even though he was way older. and we still do now, but not as much but we still keep in touch. he's in washington, i'm in hawaii. and i was pretty damn immature as a kid, but no matter what we still hung out no matter what. he used to bring me with him everywhere, even if he didn't need to watch me. so i don't really see anything wrong with you and your brother.|`|m7nrGSxEaa	Totally yes<br>  <br>  My brother is 13 years older than me (I know weird write?) and we used to like hate eachother and we would fight alot , but since I've started to be more mature (<<well sometimes) we've started to hangout and talk more ... <br>  <br>  So just give it a few years<br>  <br>  Btw I'm 13 and my brother is 26|`|VEzNOVSPaa	I'm 16 and my sister is 21, so there is a 5 year age difference. Me and her are very close. She is literally my best friend. I am pretty mature though for my age. So I say yes, it's very possible.|`|xVEqBjDVaa	It's possible. My son and daughter are 4 years apart, and they seem to become closer each day. Just try to keep a relationship with him!|`|TlFnIei0aa	My brother sleeps overall the time, we don't really 'hang out' but I love his company. When he's older I'm sure we will.<br>  I'm 20 he's 13|`|lb8FBhWnaa	Of course. He will become more mature as he gets older.|`|mE0MY4nGaa	of course!|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	i dont see why not|`|El4XqmVZaa	Just give him time.  He's not even a teenager yet and you are an adult.  As time goes by you two will have more things in common.  Don't worry about him right now.  Let him be a kid.  Just be his big sister and then later when he matures and becomes an adult you guys can begin creating a friendship.|`|eS7iQCziaa	Of course he is still immature, he is a boy and 12, so he probably acts like he is 9 or ten. He will start to get a little cooler when he turns about 16. My bro is 16 now and I am 20. Just wait for a little longer, he will look up to you.|`|fruO1G62aa	It's very possible my mom has a brother and he is 6 years older and they are still like you know friends but you don't call it that in a family.|`|AA12005593	yes.<br>  me and my older sister are 6 years apart.<br>  i'm 16 and shes 22.<br>  when we were younger we basically hated eachother, lol.<br>  but now we hangout sometimes.|`|m5Qh7gYraa	Yes it is possible.<br>  My older sisters are 14 and 16 years older than me.<br>  We hang out.<br>  We can relate a little bit more to each other since I'm older.
rhPCJfeuaa	Hang in there, hon!   You can take some regular strength Tylenol for the aches and pains.  It might even help with the swelling.  Elevate your feet to above your heart level and try your best to sleep through the night like that.  The swelling will decrease greatly.  Eat healthy, but the weight took a while to get on, so it will take as long to get off.  You can't do anything about that until the baby is born, so no use in beating yourself up about it.  Sleep propped up at a 45 degree angle, or if you can, get a Snoogle.  It really helps.  If you can't get one, become really good friends with your pillows.  Behind your back, between your knees, under your belly.  Anywhere that takes some pressure off you.<br>  <br>  If you want to email me, I am here usually late at night.  Feel better, and just try thinking about having your little bundle in your arms soon.  It is so worth it, and you really do forget about the discomfort after the baby comes and you fall in love.|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Hi :-) I'm a mom to a newborn and just weeks ago I was the same you describes. It's only that my best friend lives with me and life with her is wonderful.<br>  The best you can do is sleep on your side, put a pillow below your feet and let the blood go out of there, not the whole of course. Having a baby alone without anyone's help is hard but it's wonderful again. I could be your friend. Message me if you need someone to talk to :-)|`|3cLE5L7Saa	Sorry!!! I KNOW WHAT YOURE GOING THROUGH!!!  I'm overdue right now, and EVERYTHING hurts, I can't get comfortable in any position for more than like a minute.  Drink lots and lots of water for that swelling and headaches.  Don't worry though, nobody has ever been pregnant forever, and believe me i KNOW how it feels to just want your body back, but it will be done soon!  Unfortunately, aches and pains are part of the process.  They say tylenol is safe, but I didn't even take any of that.  Just remember, its only 10 months or so during the course of a lifetime!  I hear the key is to try to enjoy it, because you'll miss the feeling of them in your belly (yeah right)....|`|F2wI6NGNaa	im in the same situation all seriously all my family and friends live 8 hours away and my husbands all live in japan noone has even seen our 3 month old yet or seen me the WHOLE pregnancy.do you have a cafemom account if you do my name is yoshiwife on there. when i was really pregnant nad in pain i used and exercise ball to sit on it does help a lot|`|Azp6bBazaa	you can tylenol for your aches and pains. but only that. just eat healthy about the being fat part. after you have the baby youll lose alot but theres not much you can until then.<br>  if you ever need anyone to talk to you can email me.<br>  lacihensel@yahoo.com<br>  <br>  im a mommy 2 be im only at 5 weeks though so i dont know how much i can help with, but it does help to have someone to talk to. <br>  =]|`|45nSn7Rcaa	Give birth|`|f4AJHCHKaa	As hard as it is, you have to try and stay positive. Try to stay hydrated to help with swelling and all. Like everyone has said, Tylenol is safe to take, and maybe it will help with your pain. Also, my doctor told me that Benedryl is safe to take if you are having a hard time falling asleep, I tried it and it works wonders!! Also a body pillow might help you get comfy when you are laying down. You are not fat, you are growing a child who needs all that space, once you have them you will get rid of that. If you need to talk you can email me.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and I hope this helps you!!|`|bDSxO5Xuaa	Well, this is my second pregnancy. I'm 27 weeks pregnant. It is uncomfortable, with a lot of aches.<br>  Backaches, headaches, leg cramps, cravings, etc, its all normal.<br>  How far along are you?<br>  Being pregnant and feeling fat all come hand in hand. I am 5'3 and with my first pregnancy I gained lots of weight because I didn't care about it. I lost it all and more after wards. Now with this one, because its my last pregnancy I want to look good and feel good so Im taking care of how much I eat, its hard because of the cravings but Im trying as much as I can with out going crazy (oh yeah, just FYI I was miserable with the 1st because of all that extra weight, so be care full).<br>  Anyways,,,,Just want to let you know that all you have we probably all have too. So your not alone, just think about your beautiful baby inside and think of all the things you are now going to be able to enjoy.,.. Everything that you are feeling inlcuding weight is going to go away..so cheer up ok..|`|YCJz2DiWaa	If you can why don't you take a nice bath. I know you can't do hot ones, but get it as close to hot as you can while being safe. <br>  If you're with your significant other, ask him to massage you.
vsgCHQXxaa	I think it's a great idea. I'm actually going for a Nanny interview on Monday and I'm sitting here planning the same. I think it shows that you are organized and professional. I have worked as a Nanny before and found that my previous employers appreciated a Nanny log. It doesn't matter if the mother is there or not, it at least gives the parents a general idea of what you will be doing or have done with their children during the day.  Of course things will change day to day and you won't always be able to stick to the schedule, but that's what the log is there for! I think you should go ahead with it, what harm can it do!<br>  <br>  Good luck with your new job!|`|dD1WAPREaa	I think any kind of schedule you have set before meeting the children would have to be very loose and flexible. (You know kids; unexpected things happen all the time.) If you're not ridiculously strict about it, I think having some kind of plan to follow-- as well as the ability to throw the plan out the window if need be-- will show that you have given this some forethought. Any kind of employer likes that kind of initiative.|`|Ei1TcLclaa	If you do have a schedule, it'd have to be pretty loose. It is an 18 month old and 6 year old after all. Things happen and things change. When I babysit, especially for people I've never babysat, I keep a little log. I just write down things that we'd done and what we ate and stuff.<br>  Good Luck!!
NoUkTQCgaa	Hmmm. I don't know if I can live up to all your requests. Especially since I am a pro-choice, fallen Catholic who is morally opposed to infant adoption. But I will try.  <br>  <br>  The ONLY children who "need" homes are foster kids. You won't have a problem adopting a 3 year old from foster care. It's the only acceptable form of adoption, in my opinion.  <br>  <br>  The cost to adopt from foster care is relatively inexpensive. <br>   <br>  The cost for newborn adoption, either domestically, or foreign, will cost you $25,000.00 and up. Plus your soul. <br>   <br>  As an adult adoptee, I hope you will check out these links about how adoption will affect the adoptee. And after all, adoption is supposed to be about finding a good home for a child, NOT providing parents WITH a child.  Foster care adoption is an awesome way to help a child. There are parents who have adopted through foster care who will help you out, or you can contact your local DFS for more info.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.amfor.net/acs" rel="nofollow">http://www.amfor.net/acs</a><br>  <a href="http://www.nancyverrier.com/pos.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.nancyverrier.com/pos.php</a><br>   <br>  Books: <br>  Twenty Things Adopted Kids Wish Their Adoptive Parents Knew by Sherrie Eldridge  <br>  <br>  The Primal Wound by Nancy Verrier <br>  <br>  Lost and Found: the Adoption Experience AND<br>  Journey of the Adopted Self: A Quest for Wholeness both by Betty Jean Lifton <br>  <br>  The Adopted break Silence by Jean Paton <br>  <br>  The Girls Who Went Away by Ann Fessler <br>  <br>  Adoption: Uncharted Waters,by David Kirschner <br>  <br>  Being Adopted: The Lifelong Search for Self by David Brodzinsky <br>  ******************************<br>  international adoption links<br>  <br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemovie" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/adoptedthemo...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opinions/outlook/2009-01-11/adoption/" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/opi...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/4/emw117838.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.emediawire.com/releases/2004/...</a><br>   <br>  <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27859660</a>|`|nESfk0bXaa	Might want to move…<br>  <br>  My understanding is that gays were no allowed to adopt in Florida.  Isn't that what Rosie O'Donnell is always protesting about?<br>  <br>  I didn't think that marriage between gays was legal in Florida either, so you cannot have a "wife".  Just like I, as an adult adoptee, am not allowed to know who my family is, OR have my own birth certificate.  I say this to you because many adoptees HATE the pretense in adoption.  If you are pretending that your girlfriend is your wife, then are you going to have your adopted kids pretend you are their only parents?  They will ALWAYS have a biological family--always. Kids prefer the truth—learn to live there, or don’t adopt.<br>  <br>  Your referring to your girlfriend your "wife" is a red flag on your maturity to me.  I think you ought to look into what adoption really means TO THE CHILD.  Adoption is about CHILDREN'S rights, not gay rights.<br>  <br>  A child adopted by two adoption issues-ignorant lesbians is like a gay kid being adopted by a couple in denial about homosexuality.

DDnxY3k1aa	wait a couple days.. test.. then wait.. then see doctor?|`|1CryEnb3aa	Is your cycle normally 27 days every mo?  If, so, I would say you are late enough and take the test.  Use it with first morning urine as it will be more concentrated.  Good luck|`|0C5TBPEvaa	Definitely take the test, but it's best to wait until morning, it should say on it that the first urine is recommended. And you can worry yourself into a "phantom pregnancy." Some women have gotten so far into it that they started lactating. It could just be ovulation, possibly premenstrual kind of stuff. Every woman is different, so symptoms are not a surefire way to tell.|`|IZoAmKmFaa	Yes you are late if your cycles are always 27 days and never fluctuate.  I personally would wait a couple more days before you tested but if you want to do it first thing in the morning.  If you don't want to waste your First Response go to the dollar store and get a test, they are just as good.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	I would say you can take it but if your really that worried about wasting the test wait another week. Also, the $1 tests work just as well, its all ive ever used.
Coc593Ikaa	The joke is on greeneye as HPTs are not that sensitive. On average, it is 14 days from ovulation to period. The most sensitive tests boast accuracy 5 days before a missed period. Do that math, that is 9 days. Not 5. Additionally, even those brands (read the box) admit that for most women the test won't work that early. It takes until the missed period for most women to get a positive result. So she should really be careful who she calls dumb.<br>  <br>  You may not be late, just because your last cycle was 27 days doesn't mean that is your average cycle. Perhaps the one before that was 32 days? Or maybe it was 25? You'd really need to have a few more data points to conclusively say if you are late or not.<br>  <br>  The pain from 2 weeks ago could have been from ovulation, the timing would be right for that. Or it could have been nothing. It is nearly impossible to diagnos pregnancy based on presence/absence of symptoms, so go get a test and take it now. If it is negative, take another one in a week. If it is still negative, it was probably just a random missed period. They happen. If you miss two in a row, go see your doctor.|`|apUkTo3maa	TAKE A TEST NOW.|`|LbwpUA1caa	Changing hormone levels due to pregnancy bring on morning sickness.  It might be a good time to buy a pregnancy test kit.  If you do have morning sickness, try eating some crackers in the morning.|`|Yq3a6UAXaa	sounds like you're pregnant. the light pain you felt was probably when the egg attached itself to the wall of your uterus not everyone can feel it, but some do. i'd take a test asap. good luck!|`|k59o2PZaaa	You should be able to take a test and hopefully get accurate results.

aPlW5TM7aa	Well if you took the medicine as directed. I bet it is just a silly trick from your son or your son has a new found interest in his ears.

Congrats!|`|1u4CS5J3aa	I would be careful with preemie since she will out grow it super fast and you dont want them to be too tight. i got some great newborn stuff at babies r us for a really good price. They had TONS of newborn size|`|AOvtRBU9aa	I love carters, children's place and H&M.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	My first was really tiny (he was 6Lbs 2oz) and so this time I figured I would need preemie clothes too. My daughter was born 7Lbs 15oz and she barely fit in the newborn size outfit we brought o the hospital, the hat that cam with in was too small and the day she came home from the hospital was the only time she ever wore it. <br>  <br>  I suggest going for the 2 piece pyjama style outfits with out feet (made from cotton with the cuffs that roll up) 0-3 month size.|`|OgzHcNMsaa	Children's Place and H&M are my faves. My daughter was only 5 lbs 9 oz at birth so nothing fit her. She was basically too big for preemie but too small for 0-3 months. But some of my childrens place clothes fit her.  Also Old Navy 0-3 months can run small as well...
PKvKPv8uaa	That is not my understanding at all.  With PCOS, your chances of miscarriage are higher than a woman without it.  By taking metformin, it supposedly brings your chances of miscarriage down to the woman without PCOS.  <br>  I am really sorry that you have experienced a miscarriage.  With PCOS it can sometimes take awhile for your eggs to be healthy.  I know with me, my periods are so irregular that my eggs will take awhile I think.  My blood tests showed they weren't very healthy.  Please don't beat yourself up about the miscarriage.  Most of the time there is nothing you can do to stop it.  But, talk with your doctor about if there is a need to do a dye test (to check the lining of your uterus), to do ultasounds/blood test to check the quality of your eggs and follicles, and possibly progesterone to sustain a pregnancy.  good luck!  Baby dust!|`|Boubyng3aa	In women with pcos, metformin is supposed to help prevent miscarriage. I have pcos, and i am on a round of clomid and metformin now. My dr also told me that when i do conceive that i will continue to take metformin during my pregnancy.

Your doctor can always get you to pee on stick too and that will tell you.  Is there a specific reason that you are doing a blood test? Did a HPT come up Neg or something and your still showing pregnancy symptoms?  Well good luck either way sweetie but sorry you'll have to wait a couple of days usually.|`|syrh8J6Vaa	They will probably call you tomorrow afternoon
OCk7I8JVaa	you know, this one is a little like alcohol- it would just be murphy's law that you conceive during the month that you do something wrong.<br>  I would stay away from sauna's as they raise your body temperature for a sustained period of time. Same with hot baths. You don't want your body temperature going over 102 deg F because that can lead to miscarriage; I can only guess that the same holds true for implantation.<br>  Good luck this month!|`|2zC1lpfVaa	Since you don't know when the miracle will happen, It would be better for you to avoid the sauna, or at least, not to use it for long period of time.  Seems that extreme heat may affect the development of the baby brain and the whole neural system, and you will not want your baby to have deficits.
7jXChfBNaa	ok what you should do is get an ovulation test/kit and use it accordingly.. they work excellent and are very accurate.  they will tell you when you are most fertile to when you are the least fertile. and then you can try to plan when you will have sex whenever the test tells you to. there are also so many tricks that you can do if you google ways to get pregnant you will find a lot of stuff. you can try to when you are done lay on your back for 30 minutes with a pillow propped under your butt and that keeps the semen from rolling out of you, as funny or weird as that might sound it does work..|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Have sex like 5-7 days a week it worked for me both times.|`|Mt85amuCaa	yah! sex sex and sex..
R4NDgifmaa	yes becuz now its sumthing he wants...in 08 he might of actually not be trying to get u prego..that prolli y it didnt happen...try havin sex 3 times a week i dont mean jus 3 times a day i mean 3 days..that will increase ur chances in also u have to understand ur body in kno when ur ovulating..do ur reasearch gurl..it might not be so hard to get prego if u do that
16vwEBiqaa	My son did this too. I attribute it to him growing. I usually would feed him around 5:30-6 and he would be in bed by 7. I've started to give him his milk he usually eats with dinner around 6:30. This seems to have put him back on his schedule.|`|7kosr9mcaa	Babies change their routine all the time, just let her set her own scheduale.|`|bHAlwhTBaa	Try putting her to bed earlier.  It may sound weird, but it works!  My baby went from getting up at 6:30 to getting up at 5 or 5:30 and we have moved his bed time from 7:30 to 7, and he is getting up at about 6.  So we are gradually adjusting it a little earlier.  Good Luck!|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Keep her up later than normal and she will wake up later
atPuxNiFaa	u guys should be married first.. and make SURE that u r ready! well u could just wait... its only a few days away lol less than 4.... but if u REALLY want him to just say hey lets go up to the bedroom and well idk! thats up to u... make something up that will make him come where soemthing really nice looking! thatll get him!|`|SxgOy9uPaa	Guess he's got a lot to learn..Mother nature plays her own rules..If he needs motivation,to try think i'd get rid of the "EGO"first..Have fun..|`|jvjziDGeaa	Try new things. Spice it up in the bed room. Wear a really hot outfit and tease him.|`|ByoYmFsBaa	Wait, March 1st is this Sunday. Was that a typo?<br>  <br>  Do you know when your fertile window is?|`|DEIxwvKPaa	get naked<br>  undress him<br>  get it on|`|WtElgJDtaa	dude its not gonna kill you to wait just 3 days
ElVoXeqlaa	does your husband want kids?|`|77NzfiVkaa	Have you talked about this with your husband? Because this is not a one sided decision.|`|SSFy8eHNaa	Spend more time together and be more affectionate during the day.|`|bDSxO5Xuaa	Something that works for me but might require time is this:<br>  First I start kinda flirting with him, without being too forward, and wearing my usual clothes but showing off more skin..Just get his attention and his imagination going, specially when we see TV in bed or something.<br>  We always watch TV in bed, so that helps me, because I put on shows that contain some sort of sexual material,,,I will say something like " Do you mind if I watch Sex and the city, there is this episode I missed or wanna see". ( I would put on an episode that I know is spicy)<br>  Than I will probably ask for a massage or give one....Just get my hands or his hands on each other...<br>  Than I would probably start kissing him, getting him a little excited and than telling him I had a long day and say good night...<br>  That usually starts him,,and the rest for me is kinda of done..He'll be thinking about it all day long,,<br>  I sometimes dont do this in one day, that way is not like just a one night deal, I just want him to see me in a sexual way, just keep things going. <br>  If I feel he has been distant or he hasn't come asking for sex, sometimes I might just come forward and talk to him, but just because I want to know if everything is ok at his job or something, but he is a man annd I know that talking is not the way to turn him on.|`|Q4Hz8uWCaa	May sound stupid but really it works.... Act like you don't want it and you not interested! He'll start to think you lost your attraction to him and he'll want it back!|`|VfjkIZ1gaa	get off the computer and talk to HIM about it.
b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	I don't remember.  But I do know through lamaze that sometimes it is perfectly safe to deliver breech if something something and something happens.  There are certain characterists of about the position of the baby that they look at not just that they are breech  (Sorry don't remember)  Hopefully the doctor made his decision based on whether she can do it or not.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ican-online.org/pregnancy/breech" rel="nofollow">http://www.ican-online.org/pregnancy/bre...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/breech" rel="nofollow">http://www.ahealthyme.com/topic/breech</a>|`|syrh8J6Vaa	Is this her first baby?  If not there is no way I would try to deliver a breech vaginally!  The head and shoulders are the biggest part of the baby.  When a baby is being born vaginally head first if the head makes it through the birth canal then the rest of the baby will surely fit.  In the case of a breech if she delivers the body and the head is large and her pelvis is not an adequate size to accommodate it then she will be in big trouble!  It is not worth the risk!|`|vrt8bMzVaa	I had two babies both breech and both c section the doctors didn't give me a choice but if they had I would have went c section anyway because there is no labor pain and you deliver your baby in less than thirty minutes
h48LxmzJaa	I think Isabella is a beautiful and classic name -- no trend or movie will change that.  How about: <br>  <br>  Isabella Rose<br>  Isabella Paige<br>  Isabella Renee|`|Elxuvon8aa	it is too over used there are two in a class of 20 preK  that is 2 out of 10 girls|`|gjteVB2Daa	If you have had it in mind for years, go with it.  Marie is a great choice for the middle name and goes well when you say them together.|`|f8epBxFOaa	i love the name isabella please use it because i love it i wanted to use it as a middle name with the first name jasmine but it is too long but i love it!|`|6okAIPIlaa	I do not think it has been ruined because of Twilight..but because of how common it is in general.  I like the name a lot, but it is very very common.|`|BI1Ma4vVaa	No, Twilight didnn't ruin it because she is usually called Bella in the book anyway. I love that name very much. I think it is so elegant and classic.|`|2QvIM81Haa	Naw! <br>  <br>  Isabella Rose<br>  Isabella Elise<br>  Isabella Adrienne<br>  Isabella Grace<br>  Isabella Lilian|`|8WNHUAGCaa	Very pretty. For a couple names, I think it would sound better as a middle name, I'll give you a few combos to think about.<br>  <br>  Isabella Raine<br>  Layla Isabella<br>  Isabella Nadya (pronounced Na-Dee-Yuh)<br>  Isabella Sheyda<br>  <br>  I know that some of the names sound kinda off, it's most likely for my own preference for foriegn sounding names. If you want something that's special, maybe check out some sites that give you the meaning of names.|`|6IPp3ppraa	I dont think that twilight is gunna ruin this name plus they call her bella anyway...<br>  <br>  For middle names i think they either should be totally unique like...<br>  Noelle<br>  Harper<br>  MaKrae<br>  <br>  Or they should be after someone so if you have a family member that has a cool name then go for it!|`|OhaosQ14aa	ive always liked the name isabella<br>  i don't think twilight ruined it<br>  its such a pretty name so totally go for it<br>  <br>  here are some middle name suggestions:<br>  <br>  isabella rachelle<br>  isabella nicolette<br>  isabella nichole<br>  isabella claire|`|781230deacf60344d474c72bd360783faa	isabella is still beautifal. a little over used (not cause of the book/movie) <br>  <br>  middle name options:<br>  Marie<br>  Nicole<br>  Grace<br>  Rose<br>  Renee<br>  Tatiana|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	No it won't be ruined by twilight, isabella is a beautiful name and a good middle name would be Isabella Shay|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Who cares if it was in a movie .|`|fw1AIAO3aa	Its a beautiful name do not let some pop culture phenomena ruin it.|`|yCtzMvt2aa	my friends baby is named isabella reese|`|MSfuRuqCaa	I love the name Isabella, but its becoming more popular. Just be prepared that there were might be 3 or 4 Isabellas or bellas in her classes growing up.
Tr4Vj7RIaa	It is most likely an swollen lymph node.  You should make an appointment with her pediatrician and have it checked out to be safe.|`|zwctZ812aa	My son has a few of those and has since he was about a month old.  I have had them checked by the doctor and she said they are totally normal.  They can be either swollen glands or calcium deposits, but both are normal and don't require any treatment.  If it were to get larger, I might ask her doctor, but for now I think you're fine.  My son has had a few of them for 3 months and they havn't changed at all in size.|`|88YAUVU4aa	It sounds like it is a lymph node. If she has been sick lately this would be the reason for the sore lymph node. You could get it checked by the doctor just to make sure.Lymph nodes are VERY reactive to touching. So the more you touch it the more it will stay enlarged. You don't need to put anything on it. It will get smaller on its own in time. Remember, the more it is touched the longer it will take to get to its normal size. I know it is scary to find any lump! God Bless don't worry just call her Dr.|`|c51o7yqtaa	I had a lumpy knot type thing behind my ear once when I was a teenager. It turned out to be an ear infection and it was an infection pocket. <br>  I'd take her to a doctor ASAP to make sure that it isn't. Ear infections if not treated quickly can cause hearing damage and infections can spread through the ears nose and throat since they're all connected. I'm not saying that's what your little one has, but it's what mine turned out to be. <br>  Hope it helps.|`|sR9XV5Z1aa	It could just be a calcium build up, but take her to the docs anyway to be safe.|`|AA10529334	I would call the doctor but it is most likely a swollen gland of some kind.
XT0sGJchaa	8 weeks after conception the HCG level lowers(it will remain at a lower level for the rest of the pregnancy)...<br>  It is the highest at 8 weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  well generally 8 weeks..|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	Your hgc should never drop while your pregnant if it does then yes it means miscarriage.|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Yes you are correct... HCG levels do drop towards the end of your first trimester. I would decline the d&c if you have concerns and get a scan done for peace of mind. I have personally had minor spotting and slow rising HCG levels and miscarried at 7 weeks but my baby had stopped growing at 5 weeks 6 days. All the best.|`|jYPeis3Saa	the hcg should never drop while pregnant. it should increase.<br>  <br>  im sorry for your loss. i cant even imagine. ask to have your level s checked again, if it will put your mind at ease and maybe to a little bit of closure, but again, the hormone levels should increase not decrease.
NnryoMX0aa	Like someone else has already said you stressing out about not having it can cause your period to be late but it shouldn't be this late. I would defiantly take a test and go to the doctor cause the test aren't always 100% reliable. But it sounds like you might be. I have been twice so I would know. I'm married so they weren't a freak out time for me, but ya go to your doctor and get a test. I hope everything works out for you. And remember if you are its always better to have the baby and give them up for adoption if you don't want to keep them. Because they are little people and abortion is killing a baby not tissue, a baby. Like I said I have a son and they are living breathing children and its never right to kill.|`|Uv3oSJyGaa	you just may notice a belly bump soon|`|iphheJkoaa	Yes, those are definitely strong symptoms.  You are pregnant.|`|vygYFdsSaa	Hi, I'm sorry if people are responding rudely :\ Are you talking about the morning-after pill or the normal contraceptive pill??? The morning after pill can mess up your cycle but three months is a little much. The contraceptive pill shouldn't make you not have a period at all; there is a designated period week in your pack. Honestly I'd take a test now because there is a good chance you're pregnant and the sooner you know the better. Good luck!!|`|9WgZZFGfaa	If you are stressed over not getting your period you could stop them coming. if you get a test maybe it will help clear your mind is there any foods that are making you sick i know a friend of mine was like that when she was pregnant if you can at all do a home test today best of luck|`|aNJE0Pnmaa	yes even after pill you can be pregnant<br>  you have classic symptoms so be fast and go to doctor he/she will check<br>   for 100%<br>  <br>  g00d luck
9BsyKN9haa	In target they have some nipple cream in the baby section. they are by the brest pads. ITS AMAZING! go get some! It has Lanolin in it! You can use it even after you have your baby.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	you can buy nipple shields in the breastfeeding section of baby stores.  They fit over your breast, but leave open space around your nipple so there's no rubbing.<br>  At night, use a lanolin cream and try heat or cold to see what feels best.|`|Vs17ceYKaa	get a better bra something with padding or a sports bra you basically want something tight and wont rub against them|`|AA10254927	Oil em/ butter em/ just keep them lubricated and massage em.<br>  For some people ice works too!<br>  <br>  GoodLuck.|`|ERPROJM5aa	First answer, hahaha that wont work, NOTHING WORKS. Try to keep your clothes from brushing agaisnt them and you'll just have to endure, its totally hormones, unless you can change that your gonna have to deal with it. It gets better....no wait....IT GETS WORST, and not just the nipples, everything does, cant bend, sore back, swelling....glad I'm done having kids.|`|PTLXDmG4aa	i have the same prob.. 16 weeks preg..<br>  i usually lie down and put warm face clothes on them... it helps a little to relieve the pain.. lying down takes pressure off too..<br>  also at night i use bio-oil for a massage / prevention of stretch marks.. that makes them feel a little less painful..|`|SSFy8eHNaa	Try cabbage leaves.<br>  Supposedly it works, never had to use it though.|`|uj8y5AUxaa	anhero|`|fDcR0mfnaa	Butter!!!!!! It really works! thats what my aunt used. Try it. It really works. Good Luck|`|1CryEnb3aa	Nothing really.  It is your hormones going crazy with this pregnancy.  They will get less sensitive soon.

QbOYIixuaa	If you can't give up smokes, nodos and energy drinks.. you don't deserve to be a mom. That's a small sacrifice compared to what being a mother means. If you can't give up an energy drink, how do you think you will be able to carry a baby for 9 months?|`|1CryEnb3aa	The smoking can cause low birth weight and under developed lungs.  As far as the no-dos, I am not sure what kind of damage it or the energy drinks can do.  I would consult your physician on this to be safe.|`|apUkTo3maa	YEAH... CIGS, NODOS, ENERGY DRINKS, STRESS... YOU DONT WANT A MISCARRIAGE DO YOU I SUGGEST YOU STOP UNTIL YOU ARE SURE YOU ARE NOT PREGGO.|`|6PEOqeLOaa	Yes it will effect the baby. Your baby will not have a healthy start if your smoking taking high doses of caffeine everyday. What your doing to your body now is not even good. So maybe take this as a blessing in disguise slow down and smell the roses. Stop smoking, ditch the caffeine (drink water instead its better for you and will give you energy in the long run by cleaning your system out of all that crap you have been putting in it.) Start being organized and planning your day so you can get at least 8 hours of sleep.<br>  <br>  From the sounds of it if you are pregnant and you keep up what your doing now you will either 1. lose your child 2. give your baby health problems<br>  <br>  Good luck i know you can kick your bad habits if you have faith in yourself i stopped smoking when i was pregnant and dropped the caffeine and put myself to bed at a decent time going to school full time and working full time!
ENANtueuaa	Yes, because every child is different. If she eats good and is healthy, then she's just tiny and there is nothing to worry about. My daugher weighed aboutthe same at that age. She's always been thin, but on the taller side for her age. She 5 1/2 and only weighs 41 lbs. but she eats all the time, sometimes as much as me! She has a very high metabolism, like i do. If the doctor isn't concered, then don't worry!|`|Z4IwPsrHaa	Mm I dont think so. Thats a bit small. My friends little 1 y/o is about 30(but i think hes a bit big for his age). Ask your doc|`|jLI0IgWkaa	no. it's called being underweight and in the "failure to thrive" range. <br>  speak to your doctor, or a nutritionist to see what you can do to help him gain more weight. in the meantime, add flax seed oil or olive oil to whatever foods you can that he eats, and make sure he has enough formula or pediasure to drink. (if he's failure to thrive, cows milk may not be enough nutritional value.) <br>  <br>  good luck .|`|KNxs4PrZaa	unless your doctor tells you otherwise i thinks its normal.  my two year old is 25 lbs and perfectly healthy, my husband and i are both on the small side.  as long as they continue to grow and gain weight thats all that matters i think.  everybody is built different.|`|xLs62S5Gaa	my 2 1/2 year old at 2 year check up was only 25 pounds i dont think its that bad as long as she is healthy and the doc doesnt say anything about it.. i think you should have nothing to worry about|`|jYPeis3Saa	my 16 month old weighs 25lbs, and he's only in somehting like the 57th percentile for weight, so id check with your childs pediatrician|`|q1y7kgnEaa	i think your 2 yr old is fine...my 2 yr old is 26 lbs and according to the doc she is perfectly healthy, every child is different, all of my kids were about that weight and now they are still perfectly healthy, i have a 6,4, and 2 yr old and a 9 month old....i wouldnt worry about it as long as he/she is eating normally and isnt losing weight, as long as he/she is still gaining weight, it should be fine...my 9 month old is only like 15 lbs, they were worried about for a little while but said as long as she is gaining she is fine, she eats like a horse...lol...if you are to worried about, check with your doctor but he/she will prbably be ok...check out this site...then see if u should be worried....|`|zxKCVXPZaa	As per my knowledge <br>  <br>  <br>  This is a pediatric chart of normal baby weight proportionate to height & age so I think he is hardly excess by few grams which can be ignored but you should see the height <br>  <br>  please follow the following link for further information <br>  <br>  <a href="http://kidshealth.org/parent/food/weight/bmi_charts.html" rel="nofollow">http://kidshealth.org/parent/food/weight...</a>|`|hQPf1PRsaa	:D oooh.<br>  <br>  My daughter Ava is 2 and she weights 28 LBS <br>  but im not even sure if shes under weight?<br>  Im just assuming your 2 year old is just A little one. <br>  :D i wouldn't worry too much unless he/or she's weight drops...<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck|`|cQiO32ZVaa	My son is 2 years and is 24 lbs.

AA10463356	First name or last name?   Unless you have some pressing need to change it legally just call him whatever you want.  Legally you can use any name you want unless you are using it for some illegal purpose.  I had a friend who hated his first name when he was a kid.  Finally his mother said that's just your middle name.  Your real first name is Robert.   He went by Robert ever after and he never did bother to change it legally.  I'm not sure when he found out that Robert was not on his birth certificate but by that time it didn't matter; he was established as Robert.  He had to use his correct name on legal documents and his passport but most of his friends never knew him as anything but Bob.|`|Elxuvon8aa	I know a domestic violance situation where the whole family changed their names they did not have a hard time they were all 10/and above they chose names they liked|`|a94b92cff3ce40968ac165e7d7ff52e1aa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_4464680_change-babys-name.html?ref=fuel&utm_source=yahoo&utm_medium=ssp&utm_campaign=yssp_art" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_4464680_change-b...</a><br>  <br>  Maybe that can help you out.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	I don't think it's all that hard all you have to do is go down to the social security office file a claim to change the name, which i'm pretty sure you have to pay for, then i would assume you would fill out paper work, then SS sends you a new card with his new name on it.

SrcoG7JRaa	Yep! My parents are gay and they're great parents. Sexuality doesn't determine your ability to be a good parent, so the right to be a parent should not be based upon sexuality.<br>  <br>  I didn't deal with hardly any teasing from peers. That's a complete and total myth. I got more schtick for being younger than my classmates (I was a brain, skipped a few years) and for having red hair than for what sexuality my parents are. The only people who ever gave me trouble were those nutty evangelicals, and c'mon - how much do you think I or anyone with half a brain cell values their contributions anyway?<br>  <br>  As Rowan and Sunny said, it's about children. If someone can offer a good home to a child with a GENUINE need, what's to stop anyone - gay or no - from doing so?|`|frpCK0utaa	i agree with this wholeheartdly.<br>  <br>  ETA: Sunny i completely agree!|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I have no problem with anyone adopting, as long as it is from Foster care.|`|nESfk0bXaa	From foster care, sure.<br>  <br>  Adoption is about children's rights NOT gay rights.|`|BRNNVcMOaa	i know that there are lots of children out there that need love and gay couples are there to love them and take care of them. i personally believe that a mother and a father figure is the best environment to raise children in. simply because it teaches the children about both sexes and the way they are to treat each other (this only works in healthy couples though) back to the point i am very pro life and to say that perfectly responsible gay couples can not adopt is counterproductive to my cause. all children should have a home and there are people out there that are willing to give them one. my views on gay marriage may differ but the that really isn't relevant here. if gay couples are able to love and provide for children they should be able to do so. everyone has a right to feel loved the children are the ones missing out here.|`|2Z7u3Fksaa	I firmly believe that a child needs both a motherly figure and a fatherly figure<br>  I kinda feel bad for the kid also because he will be in for a hard life of bullying and feeling different and embarrassed while hes young<br>  i have nothing against gays i just think with the way our world is that it isnt a smart idea|`|AWCbp3Yeaa	I think its just fine. .<br>  since gay couples can't have kids they should be able to adopt.<br>  Later on in life the kid may have problems in school because of that, but it is perfectly fine with me.|`|wUVUXHZtaa	I completely agree.

G9xNZPXCaa	I started spotting but it was dark red almost brown. so i didn't think anything was wrong, but the next day i was spotting pink so i called my doctor and she said it could be from intercourse. the next day i was spotting bright red but it was really light and i wasn't cramping. but i still called the doctor again and she had me come in. so they did an ultra sound and some blood work and my HCG levels were saying i was 6 weeks and that's what i was measuring at with the ultra sound but i was supposed to be 8 weeks. the next two days i miscarried at home.|`|X4ZBrRD7aa	For me I was feeling really sick the day before and then the next day I was really, really crampy, then I started bleeding and the bleeding turned into big clots of blood.  i went to the doc and I had miscarried,  I was only 5-6 weeks along so im sure it's different when your further along.|`|ZfoU2lNJaa	Do you mean what causes one or what is it like when it begins?<br>  <br>  There are many reasons a miscarriage can happen. I like to think of it as just a sick baby that God is sparing. :o( Truly sad! I had a miscarriage right before I got pregnant with my daughter. It started out as TERRIBLE menstrual cramps (I already got bad cramps during my period, but these made me cry really bad, let alone I was devastated)... I was also bleeding EXTREMELY heavy. That's really all that happened. It was confirmed with blood work that I lost the baby... :o( the bleeding just got lighter and lasted about 5-6 days like a period. <br>  <br>  If you ar experiencing one... then I'm really sorry. It's a terrible thing to go through. But at least you know you can get pregnant! I got pregnant again 3 weeks later (I know, I know), but little girl is as healthy as can be and I only have 3 months left!! Good luck!|`|CuCrGDuRaa	Typically at the start of a miscarriage there is cramping, bleeding, lower back pain, or fever.  However, there are times when there are no symptoms and the baby just stops growing or living.  I found out last year at 12 weeks that my baby had died at 7 1/2 weeks because its organs just hadn't formed properly.

oQ5oKILHaa	I think age is irrelevant as some people can be well into their 30's and 40's and still not be ready to raise a child. There are some people that are 20 years old and have the house/income/brains while another person can be much older homeless/no job.<br>  <br>  It depends on the person.|`|Al4U0Im7aa	Both. You should be mature enough to have a child and have one at a time when you are stable mentally, *somewhat financially and physically. <br>  <br>  *I say somewhat because if you waited until you were able to afford a child, you would never be ready, they just come with too many unexpected financial needs to be prepared for unless you are independently wealthy.|`|HFWLYMD6aa	For me personally i think both. I want to be around 26-30 when i have my first. it could take a while falling pregnant, and over 35 fertility declines. And i want 2 years (about) between my first and second. only want two children. I'm hoping i get this job i had an interview for so i can start saving for a house. I want to be able to provide for my child without struggling too much.|`|l9iLpBkIaa	When everything seems right in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I believe that if you think you can provide a loving family, a good upbringing and be able to support a baby, than go for it.|`|OI4gWVfNaa	I think everything happens for a reason. The most important thing is to finish college and once you are making good money have babies. I really feel like most not all but most young mothers under 18 don't realize what they are getting themselves into and then in turn when the baby daddy don't want to be with them not because they have a kid but because they are not in love a lot of young mothers tend to stay bitter for the rest of there lives toward the father and feel like the father owes them everything and doesn't allow the father to see the children just to torture him.<br>  <br>  The key is that if you are going to have children make sure its with somebody you want to spend your life with not some puppy love. I fell in love w/ my husband when I was 17 and waited 5 years to have our first child and we just got married and we have been together a total of a little over 7 years. I didn't want to be just another baby momma so to say. I want my children to have there father in there life always. No relationship is perfect but if you are willing to get through anything together and work at it then why not.<br>  <br>  I have not yet finished school and have a year left.<br>  <br>  so basically finished school and be in a relationship for at least 5 years before having children unless you are at an age where you feel it is right.|`|SnQvsOPwaa	At a time when your ready. You have an education and a job and are supporting yourself.|`|tkkYIdIvaa	Time. I didn't have either. Either time. 15 and 17 aren't good ages to have children. Nor was I prepared.<br>  I think time because lets say 25 is a good age to have a child and this 25 year old had waited since she was 16 for a child and she is still immature but she is 25 so what ever. How ever if you are a 16 year old and you want a child but you support the child and you wait until you are 29 and you are all prepared.<br>  If you are the immature 25 year old you leave your baby in the bed with the bottle and she chokes. <br>  If you are the mature 29 year old your baby grows up and has kids of her own.
AA10537965	Tough age.  <br>  <br>  Don't bother with him.  You are too young to be serious. Just have fun for now. There are plenty of guys that you can have fun with so ignore him.<br>  <br>  You are going to be attracted to about a dozen guys before you are 20 so don't get stuck on him.|`|RSr4XQ5iaa	He totally likes you again.|`|b3BoOmojaa	Yes, he is joking around to hide his true emotions about you.|`|sOC3UY5Xaa	heh. your in 8th grade?<br>  He's just playin around... but if you really wanna know for sure ask him yourself.|`|U7sQv8FDaa	don't even bother with him, he's obviously too immature to state his feelings. find someone that can tell you straight up how he feels.|`|jgMICyNlaa	uh i would say that he still likes you.|`|OBNPw0bvaa	mixed feelings i think he still likes you but doesn't want to say cause well nobody want to get back with there ex when something like that happened|`|TxtOaCHEaa	I think he still likes you I think you should ask him back out.
ttzNKBj3aa	Get an appt. with a gynecologist. You would need a check up before you get whatever birth control. Make sure you get the right kind for you, like depo or the mini pill. It's good to look it up in your phone book either under physicians, OB/GYN, clinics, or planned parenthood.

They will give you the care you need and it is all on a donation base.  If you are having sex or on birth control you really should have a annual pap smear and breast exam which they will do for you at no cost or a low cost depending on your income.  They also have all sorts of different kinds of brith control for you to use, such as the vaginal ring, the patch, or pills.  Hope this helps.

IZoAmKmFaa	Everyone has different symptoms and every pregnancy is different, so symptoms alone aren't a way to tell if you're pregnant or not.  You said you knew you took a test too early, so take another one.  If you are 5 weeks you will get a positive if you are pregnant.  I honestly don't think there is any reason to see your doctor until you get a positive test.|`|1CryEnb3aa	Take another test to confirm neg or pos.  Once you get your answer you can plan accordingly.  Good luck|`|SXd74AHqaa	hi i would go ahead and take the test again it has had plenty of time to show up now.you are right not every pregnancy is the same.but i do think you need to test again soon sounds like you may be mom again but i could be wrong good luck to you and your other two little ones.sounds like you are a great mom.best of luck to you|`|4yUjAaadaa	at five weeks, pregnancy tests are fairly accurate. there are enough 'pregnancy hormones' running through your body at this point to test positive, if indeed you are. even if you are far from your doc, set an appointment, and if you are pregnant, you may want to consider finding a doctor that is closer, if at all possible.|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	These could all be symptoms of having a late period too. How old are you? How long since your last child was born? Are you on BC pills if so did you miss any or start a new brand?THere could be lots of reasons why this is happening other than being preggo. However if you are, a test should come up positive at 5 weeks. Good luck. Please don't let your distance from town keep you from getting proper care for you or your children.|`|D6muTKc6aa	I can't believe the rude comments that some people come up with.... Do not stick anything into your vagina at all.   You will hurt your baby and yourself.  Call your DR. an OB/GYN, they will be able to draw blood if not a urine test, then you will know for sure.  Good luck to you and don't pay any attention to people that have no sensitivity !|`|qV1afg80aa	be sure to take another test and get some kind of transportation to see your doctor. Better to be safe.

Those people assume Nicole Richie named her baby after Jean Harlow if they know or care that she had a baby.  She certainly didn't invent the name.  It's not like you want to name your child Dweezil or Mooon Unit.  In that case you would definitely be accused of copying|`|aPlW5TM7aa	Well I have the same exact problem.

They are because your body is releasing hormones to loosen your joints to prepare for delivery. It is much easier to break your ankle, wrist, hip (any other bone on bone joint) at this point. BE CAREFUL! They will go away in the weeks after delivery. Tylenol may help with this, but not always. Lovely, huh?

Why? If the child is his, the ex can demand palimony ("baby daddy") payments - and take him to court to get it. His wages can be garnished from his paycheck in order to pay it, in fact. If the child isn't his, he is not beholden to his ex for anything. It's worth it to pay the money for the DNA test NOW and find out what the status is.

1CryEnb3aa	There is a small possibility.  You are supposed to use another form of bc the first mo on the pill.  So, there is a possibility that you could have conceived if you hit the date right.  Take a test and see to be sure.|`|QdFOTKs9aa	First question I have is did he ejaculate in you? If so, that would obviously increase your risk of being pregnant.<br>  Another question: What is the time frame during your birth control cycle did you have intercourse? Reason for asking is because the rule of thumb is that ovulation occurs 14 days prior to starting your period. (<a href="http://www.askdramy.com/fertile.html)" rel="nofollow">http://www.askdramy.com/fertile.html)</a><br>  Another factor to consider is that when you first begin using birth control, your period can be irregular and that is normal. On that same note, it is highly recommended to use an additional method of birth control for the first month that you take the birth control pills. Effectiveness of the pill is not immediate so your protection from pregnancy does not occur as soon as you take your first pill. The WebMD site is very resourceful. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|80b9e757f7526cb72338a4af2add2306aa	First off, I just want you to know these few facts, alright? A woman's cycle is most vulnerable to getting pregnant two weeks after her period, not just a few days, and two weeks before her next one, when hormones are the strongest and when the egg is released. On top of that, even women who do have their egg released while a mistake like your's happens, only 20% of the time do they get pregnant, which is why some people have to try forever to get the baby they are looking for. That's a pretty slim time line, if you ask me. And you did get a period, so it's even slimmer.<br>  <br>  But there IS a chance that you can be pregnant still. You should wait a month before trusting your birth control to actually kick in, giving your body a full cycle before adjusting to it's new one.<br>  <br>  Also, just because you got a period, doesn't mean you cannot be pregnant. You can use First Responce Pregnancy tests, which you can get at WalMart or any local pharmacy, which can tell you if you are pregnant up to a week before your next period. :) You can also get multiples in a box if you feel uncomfortable relying on one test.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!

Y1LTzXataa	Where I come from, it's legal if they are both over 10. To have sex with someone more than 2 years older than you, you have to be 16. Once you're 18, you can have sex with any consenting person over 16, except for your teacher or your close relatives. Not many places are this lenient in their age of consent laws though.<br>  <br>  Also, someone under the age of 10 can't be criminally responsible for their actions here, and if someone is under the age of 14, the question will be raised whether they are old enough to be criminally responsible.<br>  <br>  Chloe K, you are wrong. I'm a law student from Victoria, Australia and the age of consent here is 10, as long as the other person is no more than 2 years older than you.|`|6SIjchQUaa	The key word here is "children", children should not be having sex!|`|Rk87mqkoaa	Who cares. You don't ask anyone, you just go and do it with your girlfriend/boyfriend. If you start asking if it's legal or if your parents let you, you won't get permission until you're 30.|`|AA10504387	Into the realm of the ridiculous we go....<br>  The USA needs to change the age of consent.  Eighteen --- really.<br>  How many people you know waited until after the day they turned eighteen to have sex?  <br>  If two 17 year olds have consensual sex is there any crime?  <br>  If two 16 year olds have consensual sex is there a crime?  <br>  How far can we go?<br>  If two five year olds kids fool around (assuming just innocence and no abuse issues) and have consensual intercourse is there a crime?<br>  <br>  Even in the strictest religions, like the Amish, they have a culture of lying in - putting two children after age sixteen of opposite sexes together as sleepmates.|`|77NzfiVkaa	If by children you mean under the age of consent then no. It means no matter what they want, they aren't old enough to give consent. You should check the laws of your state for your age of consent. In my state it is 16. Even if you're 16 though you can't have sex with someone under the age of 16 and you can't have sex with someone more than 3 years older than you otherwise the older person will get in trouble. At least, in my state that is the way it is.<br>  <br>  Once you're 18 you are free to have sex with anyone older than you or any over the age of 16 who's less than 3 years younger than you.|`|o4IcmkwLaa	Define "children."<br>  <br>  I believe that the age of consent is 14 if both of the people are minors. A 14 year old cannot sleep with someone 18 or over. It varies state-by-state. <br>  <br>  I personally know of two kids who had sex at 12. I don't know if it was legal. I know they regretted it and their parents freaked, but it happened and they weren't thrown in jail for it. <br>  <br>  Ask this Law & Ethics. : )|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	Depends where you live. In some places it is legal. In a lot of places, technically, no it is not. But even in those places it is not a law that is enforced all too much.|`|eH58ELw5aa	If they still consider themselves children then I'd say that they're not ready to have sex - whatever their age!<br>  <br>  But it's legal depending on what the law says.  Where I'm from, 16 is legal, in some countries 12 is legal, but in many, 18 is legal, so it just depends on where they live and what the age is there.<br>  <br>  It doesn't matter what we all say, it's what the law says where you live.|`|2H0IbjRUaa	Well the law is you should be over the age of 16 to have sex. so if there over 16 its ok.<br>  Infact in spain the age to have sex is 13! LOL|`|ElVoXeqlaa	im not sure where u live but in victoria Australia you arn't legally aloud to have sex until your 16. u may think u are ready but take it from someone who lost there virginity way to young, your not|`|GDnJYq0Aaa	kids and teens ya but if its like a minor( baby-17 year old) with and adult then that illeage|`|LDWUq6l4aa	If you have to ask, you should not be having sex.|`|5yhamK5maa	yes it is legal...who's gonna know?

Unless he ejaculated and then put his penis inside you still with some semen on it, then maybe but otherwise no, highly unlikely.  Once semen is exposed to air, it does tend to die pretty quickly and would not make the trip up your vagina to impregnate you, sorry sweetie but no, you're not pregnant.  You could have a bit of raise temp as a normal bodily function. Depending on the time of the day, your body temperature raises normally either to keep you warm if it's cold outside or you are starting the get the beginning of a cold yourself.  If your worried, take a test sweetie and put your mind at ease.  all the very best.|`|OdLj07Svaa	theres a slim chance u r but just pee on  the stick anyways no one can tell you if you are or not its ur body n the only way u can tell is if you get the test done|`|Uv3oSJyGaa	Being pregnant i your mind can trick your body into showing signs of pregnacy, but i doubt if u r|`|Mt85amuCaa	its possible...<br>  <br>  maybe his sperm by any means had been into your vagina...|`|LbwpUA1caa	You did not say what fooling around means.  Nor did you say your ages.  Here is a fact.  Sperm swim.  They have to make it through the cervix, down the Fallopian tubes.  When the male is young he has a higher number of sperm and they are much more active than the sperm of an older man.  In other words they can swim far and fast.  If you are going to fool around you should use protection.|`|IZoAmKmFaa	Very very very very small chance you are pregnant.  If you are worrying that could be the reason you are skipping your period.  If it will put your mind at ease go take a test.  Go get one from the dollar store if you don't want to spend money on it, they are just as effective.|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Read your own question and then answer it logically. There has been no penetration by his penis and he hasn't ejaculated near your vagina. No sperm in your vagina = no possibility of pregnancy.|`|0C5TBPEvaa	Worrying too much can delay your period. But I haven't heard of virgin pregnancies since Mary had Jesus. I just think you're looking into it way too much.|`|1u4CS5J3aa	highly unlikely but if any sperm, even that in pre-ejaculation discharge comes in contact with your vagina its possible. But again highly unlikely.
wJDfFutBaa	There are hundreds of different explanations for all the symptoms you mentioned. I'm a little confunsed...did you get your period? It just came late? If you did get your period, then my first guess would be that you were pregnant and something did not go right and your body expelled the embryo on its own. 9 out 10 women who have a late period were actually pregnant but something was wrong and the body rejected the embryo very early on. <br>  <br>  If that's the case, then the hormones that your body started to produce would explain all of your hunger and appetite issues. Gaining 5 pounds in 2 weeks, is not healthy, if it is real weight and not water retention. In the first trimester you really shouldn't gain much weight. I am 31 weeks pregnant and have only gained about 3 pounds per month until the last 6 weeks when my son has started forming fat deposits. <br>  <br>  Lastly, you would not be able to "feel" anything in your stomach yet, unless there are multple fetuses in there. The fetus is very small in the first and partway through the second trimester. Our minds play strange tricks on us once we have decided that we may be pregnant. <br>  <br>  If you haven't started your period yet, then I would say you need to take a test and get to the doctor....if it has started and you still can't get it out of your mind, wait until your period passes and test anyways. Either way, GOOD LUCK CHICK!|`|GmghrL4Iaa	yup there really is only one way to find out <br>  thats to take a test.<br>  but if you got your period you shouldnt be preggo sweetie|`|apUkTo3maa	I SAY TAKE A TEST YOUR ALREADY BEEN 11 DAYS LATE.|`|r35i6T54aa	YOU CAN TAKE A TEST AND IT COME UP POSITIVE 5 DAYS AFTER YOU HAD SEX.. IT WILL SHOW UP EXP IF YOUR ALREADY 11 DAYS LATE OF YOUR EXPECTED PERIOD..|`|3p0QBNpwaa	take a test, thats the only way to find out or not.|`|kQgSi1MEaa	sucks 4 u<br>  <br>  :D|`|OggDs8ADaa	Test also intestine for parasites and stress levels other than pg test.
apUkTo3maa	THATS NORMAL. ONLY IF ITS LIGHT BLEEDING.|`|K2jT1z5jaa	This is normal to happen after cervix has been checked for dilation. As long as it is not heavy. Just light.<br>  <br>  God Bless x|`|ggfE4rlvaa	It's totally normal. I was in early labor and the Resident at the hospital was trying to check my cervix for like 10minutes, it hurt so bad I felt like he didn't know what he was doing! lol. I bled a bit too, only worry if bleeding gets heavier like a period though. Who knows you could even be in early labor right now! Good luck!|`|EyKJ737daa	Oh boy I remember them doing that to me too and it was really uncomfortable! It's called "stretch and massage of the cervix".  They do this firstly to see if you are starting to dilate or not and especially if you are, this stretching and massaging of the cervix can actually send you into labour over night.  I only wish it did for me but unfortunately it didn't with any of my 3 pregnancies.  Good luck sweetie and all the very best for a quick and trouble free labour, not long now and you'll have your little baby in your arms and be able to welcome them into the world!! xx

Now he is seven, healthy and active as can be. It just a stage. Don't worry.|`|5ItOGyVHaa	my little one is almost 2. he has been doing about the same thing for a long time. but we call it "butt in the air" he climbs on top of his favorite teddy bear, pulls his knees up and puts his but in the air. <br>  <br>  so far he has always rolled over and sometimes back again. i only imagine it is cutting off circulation to his feet. but he never seems to have a problem. he sleeps all nigh and is happy in the morning. <br>  <br>  but yes. i used to try to pull his arms and legs out from under him. so i had to laugh and happy to know i am not the only one who did that.|`|mSXgWy0Raa	It is very common for some kids to sleep on their knees. He still prefers that somewhat fetal position. It is a good solution for gas. Maybe he's playing leap frog in his dreams. What a cute little buddy he must be? I am the mother of four (all grown up).When I suffered gas after having surgery, the Dr. recommended that position (stink bug) for relief. It works for kids too!|`|iFAUHTDgaa	My 16 month old does the same thing. He likes to curl up. But later on through the night he stretches out and lays just fine. I don't think it will cause any problems. They may just feel comfortable going to sleep like that. As long as his knees aren't bent all day, there will be no problems.|`|50fDeNWXaa	My baby is the same age and he sleeps like that also. I think it is so cute. I don't think it will cause any problems later on. They are so tiny it won't really matter.

Azp6bBazaa	i dont think they need to drink straight milk all the time. the dairy products should replace the vitamins they need. but i would ask your family doctor to be sure.<br>  <br>  and i totally agree with you on the 2 & 3 yr olds running around with a bottle of milk. 2? they should be bottle broke anyways.|`|bcb934cd4176c6117c3cbd9a6a0357c9aa	The milk has things that some dairy products don't. Milk has nutrients good for your kid, even for adults. Give her the milk for drinking, not running, is up to the parents to watch them and if you a kid running with the baby bottle, there's nothing wrong with the kid, but with the parents whose supervision is poor.|`|LuVV5q2Xaa	Even as adults we're suppose to drink 2-3 glasses of milk a day because of the things are body gets from it. I think she needs milk, but I don't think you would have to be giving her a bottle all day with milk in it. I would just work it in with meals, and put it in a sippy cup. Maybe she could have it with her lunch and snack and have juice or water at other meals.|`|ZZzQLjaKaa	They still need milk, but it is not meant to be a sole source of nutrients. My 2 year old loves milk, but it is provided as a drink with breakfast and dinner, not a meal by itself. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTopicDetails.aspx?p=114&np=302&id=1788#16" rel="nofollow">http://www.cyh.com/HealthTopics/HealthTo...</a>|`|tQsxsuNPaa	Yeah.  Children should enjoy milk.  They don't need to drink from a bottle.  And they should NEVER be limited to only milk at that age, but she should be drinking liquid milk three times a day.  The other things are good, too.  Variety is always a good thing! <br>  <br>  Surely you aren't seeing kids of 2 or 3 that are drinking milk to the exclusion of solid foods????<br>  <br>  And by one, they shouldn't really use a bottle that much, anyway.  They should have a sippy cup.

If you are worried call your doctor.|`|LbwpUA1caa	Episiotomies of the 4th degree can take 4 to 6 months to heal completely.  Yes the outside can look good, but there are muscle layers and nerves inside that take a good beating with all the stretching going on.  Warning signs of infection are redness, swelling, bruising, and discharge.  It probably shouldn't be "very painful" after 16 weeks.  You might want to have your female doctor check it out.|`|p0NsUYkRaa	mine healed within the first month, go see your doctor, stitches may have come loose or it could be infected.|`|AA10888290	mine took about 7 weeks.  did you go to your post partum check up?|`|7314e0678f7e9d22c9f3321ebc3beeedaa	No this doesn't sound normal. You may have severe growth of scar tissue causing the incision to pull or it could have healed wrong. Often women that have been cut or torn severely need reconstructive surgery. I would not hesitate to call my O.B. monday!

jLI0IgWkaa	get her hearing tested by an ENT to make sure her hearing is good. then get a speech therapist to help with her speech.

YOU SHOULD TRY THAT.|`|EyKJ737daa	Highly unlikely that sex that late in your cycle will make you pregnant and especially if he didn't ejaculate inside you.  You will probably find stress and possibly the thought of maybe being pregnant will delay your periods sweetie.  I don't know about you but I'd be pretty upset that it only lasted 2 mins!!!  If you're really worried though, get yourself a HPT and check.  You should get a clear answer of yes or no seeing as you are that late in your cycle.  All the best sweetie and try not to stress xx|`|fzV0R8HSaa	Probably not as long as your dates are correct.  You can become pregnant approximately 14 days after your last cycle.  But you must start counting the 14 days on the first day that your cycle begins.  Not the day it ends.  Otherwise you could risk becoming pregnant.  <br>  <br>  Your boyfried doesn't have to ejaculate in order for you to become pregnant.  Sperm can be present is the fluid that appears before ejaculation.  Be careful unless you're ready to become a mom.|`|b2acf57f08fe6f558c997db984a74b15aa	Highly unlikely!  If you are pregnant it would be 14 days earlier from when your period was to start.  Could it be possible that you are stressed???  If were to get pregnant 3 days before your period was to start then add 10= 13 so it about 2-3 days you should show up on a pregnancy test if your pregnant from that day.|`|ox0F6c8Daa	Well..theres always that chance if you have had sex...especially unprotected.<br>  <br>  I didn't have symptoms until around 2 months...<br>  and my boyfriend (now husband) and i were not planning on having a baby..but then again anytime you have unprotected sex you are whether you look at it that way or not.<br>  <br>  Yes you could be pregnant..but you will need to take an at home test.

kschXnAjaa	There really isn't any way to actually prevent stretch marks, but rubbing coca butter or other lotions like it are good for your skin, and I guess nothing hurts! It is such a great idea to start now, or even earlier, rubbing lotion on yourself can help soothe your muscles and abdomen and it is actually great to rub lotion on yourself everyday even when you are not pregnant!!!<br>  THe thing about stretch marks is, they are genetic. If your family members have them, and you have seen a couple pop up here and there on yourself, then you are probably going to get them when you are pregnant no matter what. :[ I know it is a bummer, same thing with cellulite! ugh! But if your family members have some and you never have you MAY luck out and not get any, but you are definitely prone and most likely will.<br>  If no one in your family has them and you never have before, you are more the likely in the clear!<br>  The lotion feels good and mentally appeases your fear of them, but really it does nothing lol.<br>  <br>  <br>  so a long answer to your question, YES! lotion everyday is great!|`|TGzOrftPaa	No way!  It's never too soon.  I started at 6 weeks. You could still get some stretching, but not nearly as bad as what you'd get if you didn't use it.  Palmers is amazing, especially their tummy butter.  Combine using the stretch mark lotion with cocoa butter and you should be covered.  Try the cocoa butter in the morning and apply the stretch mark cream before bedtime.  Vitamin E cream works wonders, too!|`|52U22fiAaa	The sooner the better.|`|1o820L3Daa	No,I used it as soon as I found out with both my pregnancies. Well Im pregnant with my second now.

vue9NOhYaa	Some variant of 'gently, slowly and with love.' Drop one feed at a time, and replace with snack/game/cuddle/whatever.  <br>  <br>  Beyond that -- it will really depend on your baby.  Some babies wean easily, with no stress or fuss. Other babies are very attached to the breast, and will be very upset by any attempt to wean, no matter how gentle and gradual.<br>  <br>   IF you baby is in the latter group, you'll need to decide how important weaning is to you.  IF you must wean, then you accept that you'll have to make everyone miserable.  If not ... you continue to breastfeed and wait until your child is more willing. (Which might happen in a week, or 6 months, or a year.)|`|aZXnW6AUaa	gentle and slow|`|KmpWaHaiaa	dont give it to him

r39EDGhPaa	I agree with you 300%.<br>  I laughed super hard when I read all of the defensive answers... and they were all by people who either had kids young, or are pregnant and young.  I refuse to believe there is such a  thing as a responsible teen parent.  Getting pregnant is not responsible, it is the exact opposite. I don't care if you used condoms, birth control, spermicide, and pulled out, I don't care how long you dated the guy- having sex before you can even get a decent paying job is IRRESPONSIBLE.  And most pregnancies are not from the girl being raped, a very small percent of pregnant teens were raped.<br>  <br>  It's never okay to get pregnant young, unless of course, it wasn't your fault.  But I hate when people on here go on about how "its fine if you can take care of it!" but last time I checked, raising a baby includes raising them in your own house, buying them food with your own hard earned money, buying them clothes, and not relying on your parents to do any of it.  SOME teens don't need help from their parents or the state, but how often do you see that?  If you're an older teen (17+) then I could see you doing it on your own, but younger than that, no.  Your parents should never have to be burdened because their CHILD had sex with another CHILD and is now pregnant with a potential CHILD.  It's gross.  It's especially gross when they don't know who the father is. :|<br>  <br>  And as for the people who love to be rated go, they get pissed when you say they're not that great looking!  I mean, damn, if you post a picture of yourself on a public forum, what do you expect?  And then they message you whining about how mean you are, bahahaha.  Whatever ;]<br>  <br>  I agree with you.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	On few occasions it's due to lack of self esteem,but I think for most,they're just fishing for compliments and have very little problem in the area of self esteem. <br>  ..And a lot of it has to do with the absence of parental supervision.|`|AA10071149	I believe a lot of the "I'm a pregnant 12 year old" questions are done by trolls. A lot of them are asked when the so called child should be in school. The young girls posting seductive pictures, though, is definitely disturbing. Sexuality has become very prominent among the younger population and I hope to goodness that when my daughter is older, she listens to me when I explain to her why there is no need to grow up so fast.|`|joPJtKemaa	I totally agree with you. <br>  <br>  Children having children.<br>  <br>  What happened to getting through school first, going to college and then thinking of children. Its just crazy. And all they do is get public assistance and we got to pay for this. I will get thumbs down for it but ITS THE HONEST TRUTH. <br>  <br>  If  I got pregnant at 15, my parents would kill me.|`|65755559ca83cd6ecbcfea0edf2b02bdaa	Wow, you need to chill out.

There is normally an underlying reason as to why these teens, kids or whatever they are post these questions. As for the younge ones posting trampy pictures, I agree with you that something could have prevented that. But I am a 22 year old mother of 5 who works full time to support my children. I had my son when I was a senior in HS and graduated with my class. After having some odd and end jobs went back to college and graduated with my states for EMS.|`|nL1ZHCypaa	In ways i agree with you and in ways i do not. First off yes it is possible that these girls are doing it for attention caused by absent parents, and i think that it is horrible that these LIttLE girl would post sexual pictures of themselves, however, you can judge a situation that your not in and do not understand..... these girls may not have been taught better and that should be blamed on their parents. Now as for the IM pregnant at a young age......... yes getting pregnant at a young age is really horrible and that could be due to a lack of parenting as well but not every teen mother is irresponsible.. i got pregnant at 16 and had my son at 17. hes now 3yrs old and we have a wonderful life. I did finish school and i am married to his father who is in the us army. and i am starting school to become a teacher. so Once again try not judge someone or something until you know the situation...EVERY PROBLEM COMES WITH A STORY. Why dont you make friends with a troubled preteen or teen and hear there side before you turn your face a judge!

a61UT6hdaa	i like Cullen Haynes Cape for boy and either Alice Maye or Hannah Carel for girl<br>  <br>  those are very unique names :)|`|gFNCIJsfaa	cullen haynes <br>  and<br>  hannah carel<br>  <br>  ofcorse the best name is voltera[:|`|RlKvgN9Faa	i like haeven clark for a boy and allee lyn for a girl.<br>  very original, all of these.|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	I like Zoey.|`|iAnJ8P3Uaa	NONE sweetie pie...|`|CMuL7XpKaa	Kayden Haynes & Taylor Lynn|`|u7UnUZXnaa	Kayde and Aryn are so cute! i think these two names sound the best together (:|`|AA11735792	b/g twins:<br>  Cullen Haynes - love this, favorite by far<br>  <br>  I don't like the unusual spellings, I like the names below:<br>  <br>  Zoe Johanna<br>  Hannah Caroline<br>  Zara Jade<br>  Alice Mae<br>  <br>  But since Cullen is unusual, I'd go with Zara.  <br>  <br>  Cullen Haynes & Zara Jade.  Very nice.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	I like Kayde Chris and Zoey johannah and Taylor Jade<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452</a>|`|PuRpsENEaa	I don't really like any of the boys.<br>  <br>  Hannah Carel is ok, Allee Lyn is ok too. None of them are great.|`|FoBLX9ceaa	hmm i like aryn maya and cullen, not sure about the middle name because it may look like she was trying to make it look like he has both last names, unless thats what shes going for
8Rn2pX4jaa	I think you made the right decision.  If someone is going to hang up on you... clearly they are not a professional organization that you would want to work for.  <br>  <br>  Also... big difference between starting in December and March when you are pregnant.|`|kpnSKV6Eaa	well maybe they will give you leave after you have the baby.. it is very hard to get a job in this economy right now.. if i were you i would take the job and then go on mat leave when you had the baby. after you can decide whether or not to go back when your mat leave is over.. in california you can take up to four months off.. see how long it is where you live
jUaSbfhJaa	I think Tyleigh Rose is really cute.<br>  It's different but so what?<br>  Mine is, and some hate the name others fall in love with it. It's life.<br>  <br>  The name Tyleigh is diverse anyway. If she gets into that whole hip hop lifestyle it'll work. <br>  If she becomes very conservative in the future and has a formal social life it'll be suitable.<br>  If she turns out all hippy-ish(I'm one), green, freedom fighter it'll work too. It is indeed a beautiful name. I can't see why you're brother in law hates it.<br>  <br>  It happened to my sister last summer when she gave birth to my nephew, she wanted to (and did) name him Robin, but my brother in law hated it.<br>  Now he loves it, because he loves him and my nephew gave personality to the name.|`|Lsst29Btaa	That is such a beautiful name, My favorite 2 are Tyleigh Rose & Tyleigh Claire.  They both flow nicely.  I think that 2 syllable first names fit best with one syllable middle names, they flow better.  Also, if you get stuck with choosing the middle names, or your sister, ponder it for a while, and maybe even consider what her initials would be, T.C._ or T.R. _.  Goodluck and I'm sure it'll pick a beautiful name.|`|WIEPISyeaa	I actually really like that one. :)  The name Thailynn is on my own list (Tie-lynn)<br>  <br>  I like Tyleigh Claire, then Tyleigh Rose, then Tyleigh Jane, then Tyleigh Renee.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|pmIC8aoaaa	i think its cute and really unique. i dont know if i'd name my child that, but it is defonitally cute. i like it.<br>  i like tyleigh rose best<br>  but i think tyleigh lynn sounds even beter :]|`|wr0sk5oeaa	mmm...i dunno i mean it sounds cute and everything, but also sounds a bit boyish, yet girlish at the same...ya know what i mean? but out of choices, the first one sounds adorable =)|`|BCIfeHAqaa	It sounds cute, but i dont like the spelling. <br>  I think it'd just be better to be spelled Tylee.<br>  <br>  But Tyleigh Renee is my favorite.|`|x6N60irCaa	I think tyleigh claire is super cute!! its different yet its still sounds cute and like a normal name. i also think that tyleigh paige and tyleigh noelle are cute too if you like either of those|`|Om5rY23Waa	I like Tyleigh Rose the best. But it is a little ghetto of a name. A cute name but still a bit ghetto.|`|bLXqYUYWaa	Tyleigh Rose<br>  is the best one i think i like the name it is unique but not creepy =]|`|Lo5yiBqzaa	do.not.like.it.|`|9POUmVMGaa	Thleigh Rose. It fits best together. I like the name Renee but it doesn't really fit|`|lqG3SQ40aa	I LOVE Tyleigh Rose!!!!!!!!!|`|asM2jBAjaa	First one, but there all cute. :)|`|d2FJBJ8baa	claire clearly wins|`|hLOYwnsUaa	they do sound ghetto|`|Xg60yW10aa	i like the name just not how it's spelt|`|tSLApTNYaa	I dont really care for the name.|`|aa8d66371ff46d7a821623d9f0e9c6bfaa	Prefect Tyleigh Noelle great n its not ghetto!!!|`|ooVXIZCJaa	Noelle lol no never  i like tyleigh rose though<br>  <br>  or maybe Tyleigh Mechelle|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I don't like it.  It sounds like a made up name or like someone is trying to be original and not go with Kylee.  I am not a fan of names that someone alters to make their own like that though.<br>  <br>  The middle name I like is Claire.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	I'm not usually a fan of those kinds of names, but I like it!  I would spell it Tylee though because to me "leigh" is pronounced like "lay" not like "lee."  But that's just my personal preference.|`|X9Dpyrg9aa	I love it. I think that Tyleigh Rose or Tyleigh Renee sound the best. I do however hate that everyone is spelling Leigh that way. It's so difficult. I would go with Tylie.|`|492681182d7c9b1f14276670369e851baa	Sounds completely made up and not at all nice.<br>  <br>  It sounds like an adjective to describe an over decorated bathroom.|`|xUfRRGM8aa	I don't like it. It sounds very trashy/ghetto. But if I had to choose I would say Claire.....it is kind of a snotty name so it balances I suppose.|`|rGvlPAMJaa	Sounds ghetto to me.|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Tyleigh is a very pretty name.<br>  Out of yours Tyleigh Rose.<br>  <br>  More suggestions;<br>  Tyleigh Maria.<br>  Tyleigh Paige.<br>  Tyleigh Kelley.<br>  Tyleigh Jacklyn.<br>  Tyleigh Elisabeth.<br>  Tyleigh Isla.<br>  Tyleigh Kristina.<br>  Tyleigh Rebecka.<br>  Tyleigh Danielle.<br>  Tyleigh Elle.<br>  Tyleigh Helen.<br>  Tyleigh Olivia.<br>  Tyleigh Rachael.<br>  Tyleigh Madison.<br>  Tyleigh Michelle.<br>  Tyleigh Jill.<br>  Tyleigh Hannah.<br>  Tyleigh Aliya.<br>  Tyleigh Alexis.<br>  Tyleigh Alina.<br>  Tyleigh Victoria.<br>  Tyleigh Karina.<br>  Tyleigh Kasey.<br>  Tyleigh Brianne.<br>  Tyleigh Jade.<br>  Tyleigh Lauren.<br>  Tyleigh Ainsley.<br>  Tyleigh Grace.<br>  Tyleigh Margaret.<br>  Tyleigh Mae.<br>  Tyleigh Leigh.<br>  Tyleigh Amanda.|`|dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  It's a very unusual name, and I quite like it. But I don't think it'd be very practical to be honest, as no one would be able to spell it (or pronounce it!). My name's Lorna and people still struggle with that so Tyleigh would be almost impossible!<br>  <br>  I like Renee for a middle name.<br>  <br>  ~Mystic.|`|iiRbOAQnaa	Ditch the first name (just my opinion) Try combining 2 of the middle names... like Claire Renee.<br>  <br>  EDIT: It doesn't sound ghetto, it sounds like you tried to turn an Asian name into an American one and it doesn't quite work.|`|YJV2TU6taa	Tyleigh Rose sounds the best in my opinion. <br>  I don't think I would use it but it's a cute name. Reminds me of names like Hailey and Kailey.|`|AA11273571	Cute but I'd spell it Tylee.<br>  <br>  Tylee Rue <br>  <br>  or <br>  <br>  Evan Tylee|`|l0AnNJibaa	I think you should put Claire Tyleigh instead of Tyleigh Clair|`|C8E3fe3xaa	It's kinda cute..i like Tyleigh Claire|`|V6dz395kaa	2nd or 4th one. There all good! great names!
AA10711210	It's because they have had empathy by-passes. They clearly are quite unable to imagine the the hurt and ridicule their children *might* suffer in later life.|`|aKiynqA6aa	well, john lennon is cool; my son's name is robert dylan (bob dylan) that's why we named him that.<br>  <br>  but the other stuff, yeah i think that is crazy, i know a jonathan johnston.|`|Y3DR1EBUaa	I dont know but someone told me to name my child gonzalo & my last name is gonzalez & it kind of made me thing "man are they that dumb"|`|HTULzEYmaa	sometimes they do this either so they're children can remember their parents or because it is a tradition...i was named after my grandmother first name|`|eGiLYNlzaa	They're just weird...i had a friend named Daniel McDaniels...Parents just have no idea what they're doing to their kids. Don't they know they're setting them up for teasing at school?!|`|rt2V9gLUaa	Uncreative?  It's a bit of a head scratcher really.  But I'd rather be called say Owen Owens than Dweezle.|`|hlWdFTcjaa	I have a friend called John Johns!!! Its madness I don't know why his parents did that to him! Bless!|`|wb3gL0Ezaa	What about rhyming names - I went to school with a Heather Pether.|`|Cqnbmd7Baa	The Ting Ting's  thats not my name.|`|758cDKEFaa	they probably thought it would be cool but to be honest i think it sounds rather silly|`|Y8kjVeLyaa	Think about it...Robertson is literally Robert's SON....so family tradition dictates for a Long time that older boy in that family is called Robert...after his Dad....the tradition is as old as the name...hundreds of years old.|`|oXIYHsDaaa	hey I know what you mean, someone told me to name my baby (if she had been a boy) Griswold Lee. Not so bad? My partners last name is Bear the kid would be Grizz Lee Bear.<br>  My partner wanted Seth Oliver, I had to Vito that one on account of the initials S O B, he thought it would be funny!|`|A1S5KNUkaa	Most of the time it's family tradition (my partner has a first name very similar to his surname) and it's simply because it's been that way for generations.  We're now expecting a boy and I won't be following on with the tradition which doesn't please baby's grandfather but we're still keeping my partners late uncles name as a middle name.|`|s6emVQleaa	I wish I had an answer because I've always wondered that too.  I went to high school with a John Johnston.  I also work with a doctor named Sky Blue- it hasn't held him back in life (he's a brilliant man and talented doctor), but you have to wonder what his parents were thinking.|`|C4ibOR7Laa	they are taking something they shouldnt be|`|3qLIRorjaa	No idea. My first boyfriend was named Roger Rogers.|`|64OsCr8laa	its thier child they can name it what they want and its not for people to judge!!|`|1tmX7xbRaa	i don't know i kind of think it's cruel almost like the parents are sending their kids into life with the same first and last name... kids are cruel you know they are going to get teased. maybe because it's a family legacy thing?|`|ZUL3drNgaa	i dont know. It's weird, but a little catchy . . . it reminds me of like Renaissance times, like Galileo Galilei or whatever . . . lol|`|3OeE8kMQaa	Teenage pregnancies? Drugs? Terrible senses of humor? At least Owen Owens seems to have done well for himself... you should ask him how he feels about it.|`|DNubvGpvaa	I go to school with an Evin Evans. Everyone knows who he is cause of his name, and its kinda fun to say|`|lkNJNnlSaa	They think it's cool? I don't know<br>  <br>  <br>  Gary and Phil's dad is Called Neville Neville! how crazy is that.|`|0vLU2GGGaa	i think it is dumb.  I know someone name Michael Michaels, how silly.|`|AA11705909	What like in Catch 22, Major Major Major Major?
60b853fe7d4335e1b74668b328b358b7aa	Call a friend and invite them over for dinner.  Works every time.  : )<br>  <br>  ETA:  LOL!!!  I'm glad I'm not alone on this one!  ; )|`|vmWEm4Jzaa	haha-me too! only my baby isnt here yet. i just try to keep the dishes done and the living room picked up and forget about the cereal stuck under the table! :0) clean only the rooms that are really important-luckily i have 2 little helpers :0)|`|YENiEvoJaa	Make a schedule. I wake up in the morning very early because the baby usually sleeps until seven thirty so any time before then is time for me to do things. I let the dog out, feed, water and pill the dog, do all the housework (there's not much if you do it every day), then I shower, get dressed, and if the baby is still asleep I do some light exercises on the wii fit, nothing too crazy I don't want to get sweaty. By this time she's awake. My chores are done, next time she has a nap I can do school work, pay bills, whatever. Just get off your behind! I recommend to forego any alcohol and get out of bed after at most eight hours of sleep. WHat you may want to do is make a list so you have a routine, after a few days you won't need the list.|`|Ezkn5azdaa	I am not the only one. I hate cleaning and hardly get anything done with my 2 month baby girl. My house is a mess and I have no desire to clean it. I be cleaning it soon. But I am packing and about to move to my parents for little while. I am single mom of three kids. And right now my 2 month old baby girl in the hospital and have been over a week now. She been having weight issue. They put a feeding tube in her because of it. Been hoping today would be the day to bring her home since she gaining weight. But she isn't going to be since she vomit again and trying to find out why now. But I think I know why but the doctor doesn't want to listen to me at all. Right now I am waiting for my mom to pick me up and we be heading to the hospital to be with her and find out want going on next.|`|lGcpXteaaa	Oh you could have just explained how im feeling right now!!<br>  <br>  I just put youtube on, keep y!a on and tidy...that way i just come back to change song and check my answers...<br>  <br>  Its the only way i can ever het motivated to tidy. I HAVE to listen to music hehe x|`|iH2whFkHaa	LOL pretty much I just think of how much better I'll feel afterwards and then once I actually start cleaning it's easy because I kick into cleaning mode and start having 'fun'. Usually I put on some music and dance around and sing while I'm cleaning.|`|16vwEBiqaa	I watch tv. ABC has all of its shows available online. Instead of sitting around the tv on a Sunday and Thursday nights for 3 hours to watch my favorite shows I spend time with the family. Then during the week I will take my computer into a messy room turn on a show and clean. Sometimes I find myself in front of the computer for a few minutes to watch what is going on, but I figure I'm getting more done than I would have sitting in front of the tv.<br>  <br>  I obviously have a laptop and wireless in my house.|`|0fbcc59fc901bca7e0ca600714a7fb88aa	Well, what do you do while your baby is awake.  Is the child fine and in a playpen or swing?  put a back pack on and carry the child with you while cleaning.  It will get them use to the noise and an excellent cardio.  Add some music from the tv if you have cable.  Stay away from sodas.  The sugar gets you going then you crash.  Then when the baby goes down for a nap, you can go down for a nap too.  Don't rely on friends to watch your child.  You could eventually be putting them out.  You just have to find a routine.|`|TJ4q7X8Vaa	I do cleaning spurts of 15 minutes. You'd be surprised what you can get done in that amount of time. As soon as I lay my daughter down I will set the timer and start in a room and go until it dings. She naps three times a day so there's 45 minutes of cleaning. If I can I incorporate my baby into cleaning. Like I will put her in her crib, dump laundry in with her and fold it, while she plays in it and I talk to her. If anything is left at the end of the day. I'll do it while Daddy is having his play time. Hope that helps.|`|cab8f3eed982d7c810bf2e8fc14f2cecaa	Sometimes I have to make myself do it. I am like you. I only mean to sit down for few mins while hes napping and hr later I maybe still here lol. I agree with Lynn. I have to keep going and not sit down to even watch tv or nothing bc I wont get it done.  My LO isnt even walking yet or crawling so we will see how " clean " the house is when hes doing those things.<br>  <br>  Edit: my husband and I try to always put things back were they go after use. Course I go around almost morning and pick things up if need be.|`|r7q8LW7Aaa	I try not to stop until the kids are in bed and the house is tidy.<br>  lol, I know this seems extreme, but if I sit down for half an hour, I'll sit down for 2 hours, and it works better for me to keep moving. I'm only stopping very quickly now while dinner's cooking!|`|Ph3sh6Goaa	Guests coming over usually motivates me to clean.|`|qIHTmouhaa	I turn on some music (not to loud to wake the baby up) and I just keep at it. Doing one room at a time helps me.|`|fznvQptlaa	right? i just took my daughter to afternoon K and in on here too! my son' nap time as well... lol|`|dfo5eKcbaa	O.K. finally someone who can understand me lol,What i try to do is say ok the baby goes done at 12:00 i will make coffee before then and drink 1-2 cups then at 12 when i know the baby is asleep i put on my i-pod on low so you can still hear if the baby cries and i try to see how much i can get down in lets say 3 songs then at the next nap time i say how much in 5 songs before you know it the house gets done and trust me you will feel better after the house is clean and i use that as my motivation for the next day,When my house is a mess it puts me in a funk and i dont want to do anything just make it a challenge and see what happens.|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I think it is a phase, I go through the same thing depending on how the week has gone.  Like this week for instance has been horrible.  My son has had a fever for 3 days, cutting teeth, ear infections etc.  So as you can imagine the nights have been horrible, no sleep, crying baby constantly.  Some times when you feel like being lazy you just have to allow yourself to do that.  You have a 24 hour a day 7 days a week job, it never ends.  So I say if your baby is napping and you don't want to do anything you shouldn't.  Just pick up real fast before your hubby gets home so it looks decent.  Also if anyone stops by and sees your house a little hectic they understand, you have a baby.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I know this doesn't explain in any way how to motive yourself but I hope it at least helps you justify just sitting there and enjoying some relaxing time for yourself.|`|wb781QEzaa	If you have any close friends or family members see if they can watch the baby for a couple of hours so you can rest and clean the house or see if they will help you with the house work. When i had my first baby my sister came and stayed with us and helped out with the house while I tended to the baby.
wsgZQSOTaa	if they are going to be those girls then walk away and never look back now. i personally hate "friends" like that. find someone that will always be there for you and not give you any unsults (insults in the form of compliments) or piss you off because its funny.|`|RSfFN1Koaa	You are kind of annoying. They spoke about you just one time (that you told us).|`|AqPiOph8aa	Just leave them.<br>  And I don't think you will be the topic of discssion at the lunch table.<br>  <br>  I think you should just meed some new people and hangout with them. if your really tired of it.

She may think the worst thing in the world is to have children.. who knows.<br>  My only really negative experience was this past weekend. We were helping a friend move, and a mutual acquaintance was there. She's pregnant and spent the whole time bitching and complaining about  how she just wanted a beer. I ended up in tears and leaving.|`|jOYDj3nIaa	I am trying to conceive myself and I am way out of tune of what you just wrote, you can purchase something from the dollar store that could help u conceive?  wow this is interesting|`|s8VY7uReaa	Some people are just nasty that way. You should ignore people like that. They aint happy themselves so come with things like that. im TTC too...so BABY DUSt to u..hope you give us some good news ;)|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	Forget her!  People are stupid.  *Hugs and BabyDust*|`|hfdYg5h3aa	i am sorry people are so rude. but maybe there is still a chance for you all you have to do is wait for your missed period. i know its like waiting for the lottery but you will win and if not this month just try next.it will happen and  <br>  i know how you feel i am 9 days post af and i got neg all last week. im still waiting another week before i test again. good luck<br>  baby dust~*~**~*~**~~**~|`|6lKbDEFDaa	F'em in the A! Girl, it doesnt matter what anyone else thinks! it hasnt happened to me, but i am sure that I would have said something back, like WTF is your problem?! LOL...dont stress it! :) I also got a BFN yesterday morning at 9dpo, but I also think that it was way too early. I wish you the greatest...**~~lots of baby dust~~**  ;-)|`|ZtDrwELIaa	i would have said i'm glad that i do, i hope its positive! but im not quick thinking on my feet like that so i usually go home and think about all the things i wish i would have said lol people are assholes but she might have been ignorant (well i guess obviously she was) as to what she meant and how someone else would take it. thats why i keep my mouth shut where ever i go i'm afraid something stupid might come out that will sound the way i didn't mean it. but i defintly don't look at other peoples things and if i do i don't think or say anything about it shes just one of those biyatches|`|aLAmvX5Naa	I got pregnant at 24 while married, yet I could pass for 16 sadly. I got many negative responses during my very much planned pregnancy. One lady told me it was a shame teen pregnancy was on the rise and I told her 6 years ago there were no pregnant kids in my graduating class, I don't know what happened. Must be the drinking water. And walked away :)<br>  <br>  I guess the lady at the store didn't feel you met her qualifications for mom of the year. Maybe it is your hair color? Ignore rude people.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	There are so many people who make comments that they should really keep to themselves.  It goes back to judging.  I am assuming they were thinking that since you bought that at the dollar tree than you couldn't afford to have a baby, or something like that.  Which is crazy because I have bought all my pregnancy tests at the dollar tree and we are pretty well off.  <br>  <br>  The best thing you can do is stay positive.  If someone says something mean to you just be the better person and smile.  We are trying for our 4th and many people have asked why on earth we would do that.  We don't feel like we should have to explain to them why we want another baby so we simply smile and say "Cuz we're crazy like that" :)
AmrI7VBgaa	first off-are you a father?or just a lonely mother??anyways--not only should you be around and helpful for your children but the mother of your children should feel special sometimes too.make a difference in your family's life by lending a helping hand or listening ear anytime you since they need help or comfort or just a friend. it isnt hard to be a good man or father once you get past any ego problems most men suffer with.i believe that money helps when raising children but it isnt what makes good parents.just try to be the "rock" in the family because fathers are important and strong in a childs eyes. i believe you made a good step towards being a better man by asking for directions in the first place. good luck and give your children your undivided time and effort everyday and you will always feel like a great father.|`|uvYJYZ98aa	A dad is someone who looks after there child with hope, security, and even niceness. A dad should be protective of there child, make sure they get good grades, and make sure their child has a friend. As a dad you will be challenged with a lot of things. You will have good memories. You will always have to go through rough times. Even if your child does not agree with your parenting styles as long as you know you are doing the right thing, your child will grow up to be a strong independent person.|`|SRsFkNBBaa	listens to his child, occasionaly plays with his child, provides for his child (even if divorced!).<br>  understands his child "is just a child"|`|MYU46ap5aa	For a child, he provides emotionally & financially, plays with the child, teaches and listens.<br>  <br>  For a lady, well, hmm..

aac7c6d4d79683e9cae0fe6a541bbccdaa	The hospital probably told you, but you should always call your regular doctor first-they can examine you in the office and it will save you a lot of time (and money, for you and/or your insurance company).  Even when you go into labor, you are supposed to call your doctor first and they call the hospital.<br>  <br>  But, no-it is not a problem that you are measuring 35 weeks.  At this point in pregnancy, the baby varies in size from others and also, the position the baby is in can change your measurement.  If you ever get measured after the baby has dropped, you are likely to measure a lot less than you are-do not worry about that either, as it is normal.<br>  <br>  The doctor did a routine internal exam, from the sounds of it, and I am certain that they took care to not cause any trouble.  It is unlikely to trigger labor, though some women might experience a little cramping and even spotting after an internal and yes, occasionally it might start labor.  Later in pregnancy, after you have started to dilate, some doctor's will perform a membrane sweep or "strip your cervix", and that can in some cases start labor.  <br>  <br>  Sorry you are experiencing pain.  Unfortunately, a lot of that comes with pregnancy.  I hope the next few weeks go by quickly and comfortably foryou, and wish you the best with your little one.|`|AA11920812	Perhaps she was checking your cervix?<br>  <br>  Did she tell you if you were dialated or not?<br>  <br>  Spectrum is normal. And, usually if you are that far along they will want to make sure you aren`t in labor if you are experiencing pain. It shouldn`t start labor. Some docs say that you can start labor by scraping the membranes...but there is no way that would be done at 33 weeks.<br>  <br>  Measuring big isn`t anything to worry about. They`ll just watch you as you progress. When I was measuring big my doc wanted an ultrasound at about 38/39 weeks to look at the head. He wanted to make sure that he was face down in case I went into labor (c-sect might come into play) but he was face down. And, all was well. He was a big baby at 9 lbs 9 oz 21 1/2 inches. But, my girlfriend measured big her whole pregnancy they said the babe was going to be like 10 pounds. They took her to a csect saying she couldn`t possibly push the baby out (she is petite) but her daughter only unded up being 7 lbs - exactly!! And, was two weeks late.|`|FfxgHWGxaa	at this stage in pregnancy any internal can start labour off as you are so far on. I remember with my first i was about 37 weeks when i had an internal and the next day i ended up in labour!! take it easy and good luck.
J6Ksn0P7aa	This may make me unpopular, but spank him when he throws a fit.  Take him to the car and give him a couple of swats on his butt, when he learns that he will not get anything by throwing a fit he will stop.  You can substitute whatever you use as  a punishment, but most of all NEVER let him win by throwing a fit.  Always remove him from the fun stuff if he throws a fit.|`|Z8Ui1ugLaa	Ah, don't you love this stage.  I'm going through it with my daughter and my son did the same thing.  He eventually grew out of it, but it was a struggle.  He was very head Strong and I think I would just carry him out crying but then once we were in the car he would be okay and calm down.  I remember bringing the stroller everywhere and strapping him in when it was time to leave because he got too heavy for me to lug to the car.  <br>  <br>  My daughter is at this stage now, but she isn't so head strong.  She always gets upset, the library is the worse, I can actually speak to her and explain that she has to stop crying and it's time to go home. I don't want her to be sad, because it does hurt to see, so I will ask her if she wants to color at home, or watch Dora, or have a cookie when we get home, etc.  Then her mind gets off of leaving and she then looks forward to getting home.  <br>  <br>  When that doesn't work and I start getting frustrated my next step is to ask her to stop or she'll get a time out in the car. The third, is I ask her does she want to come back again, because if you don't stop and leave now, you won't.|`|uAyYRXnvaa	I think it's always best to give them something to refocus their attention on..... like saying "oh my god, is that the cutest puppy in the world that just walked past the shop!" - he'll be out the door in a flash.  OK, he might be a little disappointed that the puppy's already vanished... but at least you're out of the shop.  Or you can have a "race" to the exit, first one there's the winner.  Usually gets my kids running... and people asking if I'm Ok when I pretend to be out of breath 1/2 metre from the door so the kids can "beat" me.  I don't have a 100% hit rate, but doing something silly and unexpected usually snaps them out of their fit.|`|MMj7YcXkaa	when my son was two, he pulled the same stunts!  I would just come to him and like 10 minutes before we would have to leave say: In 10 min we are leaving.  And when we leave we are going home, remember that awesome toy in your room?  We are gonna play with that.  Then keep reminding him over and over like every 2 minutes.  He never shed a tear or had a tantrum after  that.  You dont always have to use a toy...you can use whatever he would enjoy|`|7tV3o2q4aa	Give him a countdown.  "we have to go in five minutes.  we have to go in three minutes.  finish what you're doing, we have to go in 1 minute."<br>  <br>  It will take a couple of tries, but it will work.  within a month, all you'll need to do is hold up 5 fingers, then 3, then 1.|`|4iXL4C6paa	I usually just distract my daughters with something else like "come on girls lets get in the truck and listen to our song", or "lets go get our snack"......just use something he really likes.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	You can start on the way there.Explain to your child that "we are going to the park and even though we will be having a good time I am going to remind you when it is time to g and you need to be a good boy"then as you know that your time in the place is beginning to come to an end about 1/2 before start giving prompts like....."in 20 mins we are leaving buddy",ok "15 mins until we go",ok "10 mins,remember to be a big boy no crying"ok "5 mins" "GREAT JOB BUDDY LETS GO" remember when he does this without a struggle remember to give praise.I know it might sound a bit like yeah ok lady but I went through the same thing with my now 9 year old son and nothing worked except for prompts so that he knew what to except.Good Luck and I hope this helps!|`|7kaHDPnRaa	I would give him a warning every minute until its time to leave. Also, tell him something good about the place you are going. So, "we can do ____ @ ______" or if you go, i will do _____ or play ______with you" .And if he throws a fit, punish him. Make it CLEAR to him that a fit is not tolerable, Also, if he doesn willingloy leave, PRAISE ANd AWARD him! give him sonething to look forward to,<br>  good luck, and THIS WORKS!|`|xbzCxo8yaa	about 10 minutes b4 time 2 leave, remind him that he has 10 minutes, to finish having a good time because you will be leaving..do this again at the 5 minute and 1 minute mark, this way he is prepared to leave, you may also have to assure him that you will be returning, whenever it is that you will be returning............hope that helps|`|cHROCt3Aaa	i give him a warning, and then when it's time to go i say, 'ok, time to go. do you want bubbles in your bath tonight?' or something along those lines. 'would you like apples or grapes for a snack?' it distracts her even if it's just long enough for us to get to the car. :D|`|qSptjMp3aa	you must give him a ten minute warning or five minute warning so say in five minutes we leave and tell him its time to go home so he can have fun there!
Coc593Ikaa	Are you asking if a woman in a coma can get pregnant and have a baby? Yes. There have been cases of this in the past.<br>  <br>  ADD: As far as "keeping" the baby...no. Obviously she could not take care of the child. Someone else would be granted custody. However, if she regained consciousness, she could get her baby back.|`|0qP8gLpyaa	deliver a baby? probably. <br>  Keep the baby? no. <br>  The baby would either go to a willing family member for custodity of the child OR if no one in the family was going to step up or if family wasn't available to take the child (such as they are rather aged or have no ability to care for a child) then in those cases I would image foster care would be called in to take the child until such time the mother regained conscienceness and could care for the child or until the child could be placed into a home if that were not possible.|`|mpgpImZyaa	Yes.<br>  While in a come your body is still working, you're still breathing etc.<br>  So the nutrients would still reach the baby.<br>  So Im almost positive its possible to have a baby while in a coma.|`|2wmuuOHRaa	u can get pregnant and carry a child while in a coma but keeping it would be difficult becacuse u wouldnt be able to care for the child|`|L7uz5Xmzaa	<a href="http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&res=9404efd71639f936a15752c0a960958260" rel="nofollow">http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.ht...</a>|`|AA10888290	yes

4RjM5lElaa	UGH - I went through the same thing.  I was HUGE and could not find any support.  I stumbled on this bit of info and have been making sure all my mommy/mommy-to-be girlfriends are in the know:<br>  <br>  Go to the hospital where you are delivering - or call them or another hospital - and see if they have a gift shop.  Many are now catering to moms.  If they have this kind of gift shop (you can find out on your hospital tour, through the hospital website, or just call), see if they offer nursing bras.  If they do, go there. <br>  <br>  Many perks to this:  You get a QUALITY bra - which you need for support, you can get a fitting - so someone will help guide you to the right bra for you and you do not end up wasting cash. <br>  <br>  Two things:  A good nursing bra will cost $$$ - I wasted over eighty on several cheap ones...ended up spending 60 on ONE high quality one that could hold me properly - bought it at the gift shop and the support was great....AND it lasted many, many months.<br>  Get fitted AFTER your milk comes in - otherwise you will get into a bra that might be too small and then, again, you've wasted cash.<br>  <br>  Good luck!!!|`|da0bd1389f2c6ba2fe645d6d1c4be705aa	I know how you feel im fighting with the bra thing also in a normal bra i cant fit a D but am no were near a DD went to motherhood maternity and they gave me a E bra and what scares me is that it fitted key word fitted no longer does! if you ever figure out bra sizes let me know!

vue9NOhYaa	There are no set rules. The main difference in the size of the jars, so when your baby is eating enough to make them cost effective, you can move on.  <br>  <br>  Do be sure to read the labels when buying stage 2, since many of them contain starchy fillers, and are less nutrititious than the stage one foods, which are just what the label says. (A 'vegetable and chicken dinner' for example, is often mostly pureed carrots and rice, with just a bit of chicken...)|`|zPYyGw8oaa	my son started 1 at 6 months...I moved him to 2 a few weeks later|`|4t5eGShiaa	My 6 month old son is now on stage 2 baby foods. You can move to stage 2 as soon as you've finished letting your little tastes the flavors of stage 1 (to make sure he's not allergic)<br>  <br>  Stage 2 is basically combo flavors of stage 1 foods and just a tiny bit thicker. (if its still to thick for your little one, just mix in some water or BM or formula to thin it out)|`|NroZQN5vaa	When he seems ready to take on a thicker texture, start adding cereal to his food to make it a little lumpier.

I started with one flavor, kept him on it for a week then moved to a new flavor till he got through all of them then moved to 3rd purees.

pXSKSS3daa	Yes, car seats really do have expiration dates. You will need to get a newer model, unfortunately. Nurses will come out with you when you are ready to leave and ensure proper installation of the seat.<br>  <br>  I actually saw on an episode of Bringing Home Baby that a couple couldn't install their car seat correctly so one parent had to leave the hospital, take it to a fire department, and have it installed correctly. They then had to show the nurse they knew how to install it and all was well.<br>  <br>  "Let's say you're on board so far. Now, you need to know the reasons why they expire. <br>  <br>  Technology changes  <br>  <br>  Car seat technology is always evolving, as are vehicles' ability to secure seats properly and consistently. Before 2002, Lower Anchor & Tethers for Children (LATCH) did not exist.  Now it's a common system by which car seats are installed.  The same is true of top tethers on car seats and tether anchors in cars. A skilled technician would never think to bypass tether usage if it is an option. This technology exists to make our children safer. <br>  <br>  Materials wear out<br>  <br>  Plastic stresses and warps. Straps and fabrics fray and rip. Instruction manuals get lost or destroyed. Important instructional labels fade, tear or fall off completely.<br>  <br>  Manufacturing landscapes change<br>  <br>  Your manufacturer may no longer stock replacement manuals and parts. Maybe the company has gone out of business entirely.<br>  <br>  The bottom line is this: Know how to check your car seat's expiration date and vital information. Retire that old car seat and get a new one if necessary. As always, ask for help. Contact a CPS technician for some curb-side instruction."|`|oXzHvsBpaa	I went to have seat installed the expired in a month and they wouldn't let us put it in. The car seat that they purchased was not brand new. Car seats have a life of 5 years before they need to be replaced.|`|XSol0H6Uaa	I don't mean to be rude, but when it comes to car seats, don't you think your baby's safety is #1?  Do you know for sure she bought it brand new, do you know for sure if it has never been in a car accidient? I say buy a new one.  and yes, they have expiration dates on it, because it's time to buy a new one, that has safer components to it.

You set the pace and prevent it from getting out of hand.<br>  <br>  BTW I don't think she needs a doctor.

r7dYHFLtaa	On the child's behavior !<br>  <br>  I leave my baby with my mother in law..And when I drop off my baby,she's always happy ! So,That makes me feel GOOD ! and that she's well taken care off...|`|DDIBEvUTaa	i think every parent who leaves their child with a sitter should use them.  I'm thinking of getting a job sitting full time & it wouldn't bother me at all, in fact I'd encourage it.  Sitters/nannys should have nothing to hide.|`|iIJm5JToaa	Before I had a kid, I thought it was kind of creepy, and overpriced.  Now that I have one, I wish I could record every second of every day.  I loved my sitter, but still wondered all day long what was going on.  <br>  <br>  Turns out she wasn't that great, but it took me a few weeks to figure it out.  Overly wet diapers every time I picked him up, her telling me he was fussy ALL the time when he was fine at home, being able to see that he had been crying alot (I could tell by his eyes) and the fact that I saw here leave her 4 month old on the couch.  But it takes a while to put it all together.  (one day a wet diaper, the next day fussy, then an OK day, etc)<br>  <br>  Needless to say, he's not going to that daycare anymore.  I watch how people act with their own children over an extended period of time before I let them watch my kid.  If they're mean to theirs, they'll be mean to mine.|`|hqx5T6HEaa	You might be shocked by what you discover.  I had to get rid of ours.<br>  <br>  We used a nanny cam.  Our nanny is great.  I've never seen her mistreat our 1-year-old, but she often masturbates on our sofa when our daughter takes a nap.<br>  <br>  My husband got off on it.  I got rid of it.
Coc593Ikaa	Well, my doc didn't tell me to eat donuts, but the 3 days prior to the test day I had to eat a "carbohydrate-loaded diet". I was instructed to eat an extra 150g of carbs a day. It was quite hard to figure out how to get those in. Perhaps that is where your donuts come in, to get you the extra carbs in your diet without you having to think too hard about it.<br>  <br>  ADD: Just did some googling...your 4 donuts would be an extra 100g of carbs.<br>  <br>  ADD: Eating them throughout the day would minimize your body's response to them. If you ate them all at one time, you would have a larger impact on your insulin response.|`|rI0d7K9Zaa	I've never heard of that. I had to fast for 12 hours. drink some nasty orange sugar water that they gave me at the clinic. and then I had a blood test every 30mins for 3 hours. It doesn't seem to make sense to ask someone with possible diabetes to eat 4 donuts a day.|`|Vs17ceYKaa	i had to do the 3 hr its just to make sure you dont have dieabetes but i never was told to eat donuts they said have something sweet atleast once a day well good luck|`|LDiBjNf5aa	I have never done it before, but I can't say that it sounds all that bad ;)|`|4D1VEKW5aa	Never heard of them telling you what to eat before you start fasting, thats new to me.|`|T48smu01aa	I don't understand you question?? are they having you eat the dough nuts or are you confused about the fasting??<br>  For one if your doing the 3 hr test I would try not to eat dough nuts at all for the day since there really high in sugar.....they have you fast because they want to make sure your blood sugar is low enough so when you drink that really icky drink it shoots u whether is be normal or way out of whack which would GD. I hope I helped.|`|Bw18seFqaa	I was suppossed to do this test, but couldnt do it..  I didnt get instructions on eating donuts tho.<br>  <br>  I was suppossed to fast before the test, get a fasting blood draw, drink the glucose drink, and then get blood 1, 2 and 3 hours after the drink.<br>  <br>  If you vomit at all during the test, it has to be redone.<br>  <br>  Its to see how your body is metabolizing the sugars.<br>  <br>  Since I couldnt do the test, my Dr had me fast, get a fasting blood draw.. go eat, then get a blood draw 2 hours after my meal
ffe04ac4fefbb1ae0a7bd8d06171e322aa	Emily and Matthew|`|d6e11chxaa	It's NOT Ava and Aidan. Those are the most popular names as voted by the users of one website. Not accurate at all! Going on individual spellings of children born in the last year who applied for social security numbers in the US (a MUCH larger group), the top names are Jacob and Emily. Verity with appellationmountain.net counted up all of the different spellings and variants of names from 2007, and the top names are Joseph and Isabella. I would make the argument that if you cluster names a bit harder, anything rhyming with Aidan would win by far for boys, and Em- names would win for girls.|`|z7pyuwxGaa	Girls<br>  #1 Isabella<br>  #2 Ava<br>  #3 Emily<br>  #4 Elizabeth<br>  #5 Abigail<br>  <br>  Boys <br>  #1 Aidan<br>  #2 Jayden<br>  #3 Jacob<br>  #4 Micheal<br>  #5 Ethan|`|xyI7PRuhaa	Ava and Aiden|`|fKCWfCviaa	Kade for a boy<br>  and Ella for a girl.|`|AXEp1Bu6aa	I think it's Aiden and Ava.|`|kHk8rS5Xaa	aiden/aidan<br>  ava
RT3Og4Oiaa	WAY too young for cow's milk. starting babies early on cow's milk is bad because the lack of vitamins and iron...it can cause anemia in babies. <br>  <br>  Have you tried all formulas, like Lactose free ? Acid Reflux kind? Gentlease? Soy? Changing formulas too often can also be a factor in the digestion of the formulas. Can be too much on LO's tummy. Try one and stick with it, until the can is gone, and then if it doesn't work , try another kind. Their digestive systems can only handle so many changes at once.|`|AA10186411	DO NOT.  At that age there is a HIGH risk for intestinal bleeding, as little one's intestines are not capable of handling cow's milk at this point.  Has he tried Nutramigen?  What about Good Start? Those were the ONLY 2 formulas that my daughter could tolerate.  It sounds like if its reflux, you may either just have to deal with it, or get surgery.  Cow's milk wouldn't make it go away anyway.  My daughter is 17 months and still suffers from reflux, only not as bad.|`|KyFCYs0Yaa	It is not really the lack of vitamins in the cows milk, it is the lack of fat. Infants that small need the fat for physical, as well as mental development. <br>  Try Enfamil Nutramigen formula. It is expensive, but well worth it!! I used it with my daughter, and I noticed a dramatic difference in 48 hours! Since your baby is almost 6 months old, he probably wouldn't need to be on in for more than a couple of months.<br>  Ask the doctor about the Nutramigen formula, and about the cows milk.<br>  Good Luck!|`|OrKpKxkHaa	Oh he is way too young. Cow's milk does not replace formula when a baby turns 1, food does! You cannot possibly think that someone can survive (nevermind thrive) on milk and vitamins do you??? Ask your doctor, I'm sure he will disagree. Keep trying formulas and working with the doctor. In the end, spit up is annoying but as long as the baby is growing, it's not really a problem. Good luck!|`|NroZQN5vaa	I just started my daughter on cow's milk and she's going to turn one this weekend. 5 or 6 months sounds awfully early to me. Have you discussed that with your doctor? Maybe they have some other suggestions. Babies that age tend to have trouble digesting cow's milk properly. I would talk to your doctor about it. If they give you the all-clear, go for it. Otherwise, they might have a different idea.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	No, I don't think he is ready for cows milk. Just keep working with his pediatrician.|`|Wb9oqcWDaa	I think you should stick with the formula.  Maybe the baby is upset from all the changing.  It's not good to change formula like that, it upsets their tummy.  I was having issues with it also and my Dr suggested Enfamil Gentlease and it worked wonders.  Also I started putting Gas drops in all of his bottles and that worked also.  Cows milk doesn't have enough nutrients for a baby that young.|`|cWw4USvZaa	I would ask the doctor again, as I was told not to put my kids on cows milk until 12 mos. I will say that my daughter has basically the same problem (she throws up cows milk even now, as it is too hard on her stomach). She is now 2 and drinks goat's milk, and NEVER throws it up. You could ask about opinions on goat's milk|`|RPBeYbx9aa	COWS MILK BEFORE AGE 1 IS A NO!!!! Intestinal bleeding happens when their little bodies cant tolerate a DIFFERENT SPECIES' milk. why is nobody breastfeeding??? Babies delicate little bodies are built to digest breastmilk made naturally and free in the mommies body!! why is nobody breastfeeding anymore adn now even trying to give him breastmilk from a cow!!!???? sounds absurd!!!|`|KatjfLLwaa	I gave my kids cows milk early too. It didnt harm them. Both of my kids went through 6 or 7 different formulas and they still threw up. I eventually gave my son canned evaporated milk which seemed even better than cows milk.|`|2LmfQUbKaa	hi well i dont see what it could hurt try it and see if he dont spit it up then you have a winner if so try some soy milks! good luck!|`|AA10713742	It is recommended that you wait until your baby is 12 months old.<br>  <br>  You should talk to his doctor.

1w5B2kTlaa	Damien is a beautiful name by the way.<br>  <br>  I think Pierce would be a good choice because it sounds sharp and has a crisp feeling to the name.|`|DO3grY10aa	You have several good choices there.  If Joseph or Christopher are family names I would definitely choose them over any of the others.  <br>  <br>  Because Damien is so closely associated with the movie The Omen, it would be good to choose a classic middle name in case he ever decides to go by his middle instead of his first name.<br>  <br>  Damien Joseph gets my vote.|`|8CTNzb6kaa	Riley|`|7DcNVvaRaa	I still can't get past the old horror movie The Omen where the kid's name was Damien.|`|Vk6oCBgQaa	Damien Cade, Joseph, Christopher|`|oqhF2Gsaaa	Damien Riley is the best.

T0gv52CDaa	With my oldest son, he would take a bottle from anyone but me.  If I was in the room, he wanted the breast, but if I was not around, he had no problem with the bottle.  Your son will not starve himself.  Try leaving the room if not the house when your mother is going to be feeding him, or if you are home, then let the chores wait until he after you have fed him, then go back to whatever else you need to do.|`|deIzFnV8aa	We had this problem at almost exactly 3 months, and I can't say we have completely overcome it. here are some things that have helped:<br>  <br>  Giving the bottle in the same chair that baby usually nurses in.<br>  <br>  Dimming the lights ffor less distraction.<br>  <br>  Singing to baby while they eat; stroking their cheek<br>  <br>  Trying a faster flow nipple (medium flow), since many babies become more efficient nursers at this age.<br>  <br>  Being persisent - not giving them the breast if they refuse the bottle. Wait at least 15 minutes so they don't learn that refusal=getting their way.  If  you are around, give him th ebottle yourself instead of nursing.<br>  <br>  Give mom something that smells like you to wear.<br>  <br>  And good luck!|`|g7r4W2vRaa	Now he knows the difference really well and also knows what he prefers. The only thing I can suggest is make sure the milk is warm like when it is coming out of your breast and to keep offering it to him. If he still refuses then I suggest feeding him before you leave the house he should last at least 3 hours before the next feeding so try to be home for it. My son hated bottles he took them only when he was a newborn but around 3 or 4 months he refused and I could never get him to take another bottle again. So I had to work my schedule around him and you may have to do that as well. it isn't that bad especially when he is older and you don't have to feed him as much.|`|wb781QEzaa	Who is spending more time feeding him you or your mom? If she is then he might have formed a bond with her and will only take the bottle from her or maybe you changed something in your diet and he doesn't like the way the breast milk is tasting now. Or if you are doing more breast feeding than bottle feeding then he might just prefer your closeness and that's why he is refusing the bottle.|`|SJEqXq21aa	u should check the sucker to see if enough milk is coming out. maybe its too small so he gets frustrated.. cuz that happened to my baby.<br>  or maybe he just likes ur breast more!  just like some babys get used to the bottle other babies might get used to the nipple. . i dunno mamas but im no doctor so u should ask.
af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	deff get a blood test.i say ASAP you already haven't had your period in a good while unless your period is irregular that could be why.. but if you're usually regular deff go get checked out! baby dust to you!! =]|`|eA9UQPqNaa	try and take a test with a doctor or try takeing blood tests sometimes home tests are wrong and not very accurate|`|lB405hQKaa	Go see your doctor for a blood test.

0UPvxzkxaa	yes you  are making Sense lol... i'm not sure if you should take that as an effective reading as the two lines are already printed but hormones in ur urine change the colour to form one or two lines. personally i would forget that one and try another(know there expensive) but just to be sure. your GP will do one for free.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	I really dislike the digital tests and actually they aren't as good at detecting an early positive.I would just try your regular store brand test or even a regular Clear Blue Easy.If you saw 2 lines it COULD be a +,but you aren't supposed to read the results after 10 minutes.Good luck and I hope this helps.|`|F3dWvVy5aa	You can tell by the thing you pee on without the digital thing. if you saw two blue lines it should be positive. Just go get a regular test not digital, I always didn't like the digitals. I was pregnant and one said I wasn't.|`|xypA3yZMaa	I think i understand... you may be pregnant why don't you purchase one of those tests that are easy to read? just to make sure.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	You need the digital thing. It tests differently than a regular two line test so always shows two lines even if you aren't pregnant. Go back to the first response tests, those are my favorites although I used both when I was pregnant and both worked well.|`|p0prrzf2aa	get a different brand. try a digital|`|HPRlEWu1aa	after a few hrs i believe the ests arent accurate ... u should take the clear blue digital that says pregnant or not pregnant|`|soFpywFcaa	try digital .....................................get l a few more actual and try again|`|WWcaKZ7Qaa	Hey there. You can't really tell by the tester on the inside after that long of time, you can get evaporation lines which will show you are pregnant even if you aren't sometimes. Sounds like your tests were defective, which sucks! I'd call and complain about that actually.<br>  <br>  Anyhow, everyone seems to recommend the digital tests, but I never really cared for them. They give errors and mess up a lot plus they are less sensitive than many other tests on the market. I used first response tests and had a lot of luck with those. The pink dye in them shows up a lot more clear than the blue dye of other tests I tried. I'd get another test and try again, preferably in the morning with your first urine of the day. Good luck with round two!|`|d1027f6834f2f2660c8aa9290737073eaa	You need the yes/no readout on the test.....your tests are invalid and need to be tossed. <br>  <br>  However, call them with the lot number on the box and let them know what happened and maybe they'll send you some new ones or reimburse you for it.<br>  <br>  Unless you're way late for your period I wouldn't take the digital tests, I would stay with the stick tests.<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  EDIT~~I'm not sure why people aren't understanding~~this IS the digital test that she's talking about here! You can't get the same results by looking at the strip on these as you can the stick tests.

AA11116434	Yes, my first pregnancy took 2 IUI's. The 2nd IUI was medicated on clomid.<br>  Trying for #2 was much harder. It took EIGHT exhausting, expesive IUI's. 3 were unmedicated, 4 were on Clomid, and the very last one was actually unmedicated and was the one that stuck. It's a numbers game, like gambling. Try not to take it personally every month when it doesn't happen, but I hope for your sake it only takes 1 try. And, I have a 40 year old friend who concieved TWINS unmedicated on her 1st IUI!!

i2cZDC81aa	brooke was right on. He has more than likely discovered the little holes in his ears.... then it will move to the nose. lol have fun!|`|Boubyng3aa	My nephew 19 months old was doing the same thing about a week ago, and we thought that it was just him being exploratory, and when my sister-in-law took him for his shots, she found out that he had fluid behind one ear, and infection in the other. She too had just had him to the dr a couple of weeks earlier and the Dr's said nothing was wrong. I hope your son doesn't have a ear infection. Best of luck|`|aPlW5TM7aa	I think your toddler is curious about his new found ears and wants to know the use of them. I'd just keep q-tips and objects away from him when your can, cut his nails, and just keep an eye on him.<br>  <br>  Just wait till he finds his eyes and starts poking them constantly. haha :) Good luck dear|`|cQiO32ZVaa	My son used to do that, lol, however, it went away after a while. My son used to try stuffing food in his ears but would say it was a bad thing and stop him from doing it, so I guess he realized it was not a good thing to do.|`|CJkrXeDgaa	Usually the sign for an ear infection is ear pulling.  Sounds like he's just really in to his ears! (better than the nose, I guess)|`|mSXgWy0Raa	A lot of little quircky behavior that kids do are their personal traits. It's the funny story you'll tell about them when they grow up. If he's had 3 opinions on possible ear infections with an a+ then the next question is do you react when he does it? Or does he do it when your not looking also? If he gets a reaction from you, he may be doing it when he feels a bit neglected. He may just be facinated with them as in a phase (to out grow). Since kids like to immulate grown ups, he may be doing it after seeing the q-tip thing.The first time he hurts himself, he'll hopefully stop.Does he do it only when your friend comes over? Kids are notorius for jealous behavior.Don't worry!
ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	pumpkin patch. When I had my son I was so frustrated with the lack of cute baby clothes for boys. <br>  Pumpkin patch has great styles, comfy, and very reasonable priced.|`|CsnIpuNvaa	If your budget is low, there are cute clothes at Once Upon a Child.  I got cute GAP and Old Navy clothes there for my baby boy.
OEMIkJTUaa	For a girl, I like Gracyn. It looks girly and is very cute!|`|MCsHlqtiaa	I LIKE Gracyn it sounds like a cut name and it sounds more girlie because it has the whole grace type thing in there!|`|oYmZUO8Caa	I LOVE Gracyn. I really don't like the "ae". Good luck!|`|mbfXOPRXaa	I like Greyson and Gracyn.|`|WnlzScIyaa	Gracyn is the best it is more elegant and girly! Cute name!|`|bpdVWt7aaa	graison|`|484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Graysen, or Graysun would be nice. <br>  But it definitely sounds better for a boy. <br>  Gracelyn is cute for a girl. :-)|`|M2EKtjIbaa	Um. You're kid's going to be nicknamed "Gray". Did you really not think of that?|`|CxRJwJsraa	all of the ones with a and e remind me of the word greace. <br>  Grayson and Greyson are too boyish to me.<br>  <br>  I went to school with a girl named Gracyn and I've always prefered that spelling for a girl. I'd also like Gracen, which wasn't mentioned.|`|1hciyvKdaa	Whatever is the most femine looking. The name is so masculine.<br>  Gracelyn is a more feminine version?<br>  For short, Gray just sounds so dismal to me, so nonenergetic, or whatever.|`|mRQxlNH5aa	I like Grayson best but there is also Graysyn, Graison, Graysin, Grasyn, Graesin, Graisin, Graycin...just some ideas...hard to come up with more though lol. Congrats! I think it's really cute for a girl too!|`|Oo3PC1yQaa	I've never heard that name before, but I like it. <br>  <br>  I'd spell it Grayson or Graceyn.|`|jBnQiZVFaa	I like Greyson.  Grayson is my second vote.  The others are too complicated.  I should know, I have a common name made complicated with spelling. I have to spell it for everyone.|`|J9fxTGwKaa	Greyson is cute<br>  <br>  <a href="http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452" rel="nofollow">http://babynames.com/namelist/9680452</a>|`|ZCT2mKmaaa	Graesyn|`|LJ0uNLlAaa	Grayson, like normal.|`|KOcCenrEaa	Gracyn  for girl.<br>  Greysen for boy.|`|LmlIzdwsaa	Greyson- Very cute name !|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	I love Gracyn =)|`|syVPYmXWaa	graceson or graeson!<br>  <br>  congrats!!...is she going to have a middle name?
YJVmL9Ubaa	Tell him from now on he can only have contact with her in case of an emergency with the child,or only about dropping the kid off or picking them up,that's all,because you are uncomfortable with anything else.Tell him in fact she can talk to you about anything and you'll give him the message about the child unless it's an emergency.|`|lLyyuPpvaa	You have to think at all times about the children in a relationship.  Yours, his, hers...relationships with ex's must be tolerated and encouraged for the sake of the children/child.  If they can still get along, great, most can't.  If you think he wants her then that is something to be discussed with him, but you can't expect him to just abandon his baby that he had with her, even if you have one with him.  And I would sincerely hope that you want him in his child's life, because if he can give up on one child he can give up on yours if you have one, in a heartbeat too.  You don't have to like her, but you do have to understand that she is going to be in your boyfriends life forever because they share a child.  Now ask yourself if you are okay with seeing her every week and letting her be in your boyfriends life every week....if not you need to get out now.  Don't make him choose between the two of you, because if he is any kind of man at all he will choose to be with someone who understands that a child needs both of their parents, not just one.|`|POGZZmoUaa	If you want this guy in your life you better realize that the ex and his baby are part of the package, for the rest of your life.  Why would you want a guy that would abandon is own child?  If he is any kind of man at all he would never abandon his child and accept only yours.  If you think there is a chance of them getting back together and you can't accept his child then forget him and find a man the has no other children.  Don't complicate his and his child's relationship, doing that will only mess up your own life.|`|jIsAIwCgaa	You got with someone who has a baby, you knew that the baby and the momma came with him. and thats REALLY Fukd up for you to say you would like to have a baby to make him forget about his other one! how would you feel if you did get prego and she got him to forget about you and your baby and go be with only her?!!!! If you dont like him and his whole package then maybe you should just move along. im sure your not the only one bothered by the sittuation! Atleast baby momma is trying!|`|IoWoDxG8aa	You need to talk to him to find out what his intentions are. The fact is this: She is havng his baby and he is going ot be connected to her for the next 18 years. If you love him and want to be there and support him, then you need to be there for ALL of him...that means him, his baby and his baby's mother because she is apart of his life. If you can't deal with it, then leave and move on. There are many men out there that are single and don't have a bun on the oven.|`|OIS808Qmaa	You must be a teenage girl, because no decent grown woman in her right mind would say such things.  What you don't understand is that she had his child, and even though they aren't together, it is best that they remain friends for the sake of THEIR (not just hers) child.  He will never just forget about his child.  And you should be happy that she's nice to you, even if it is fake, because chances are she doesn't like you either. (just a hunch, because you don't come across as a very kind hearted person)  Get over yourself, and fast.|`|VOmE0UFsaa	that wont solve anything*~ it will prob make things worse*~ thats his child and he is going to love it no matter what*~ have you tryed talking to him about it?? Tell him that you understand that he has a kid*~ and thats fine but u feel that if hes going to be with you then he should only talk to her about the child*~ Its okay to be civil with the person but if hes talking to her more than that its not cool*~ and if he cant understand that and isnt willing to change things for your relationship with him then hes not worth it*~ adding another child to this right now may make things worse*~....  Try talking to him*~ good luck*~|`|AA11116434	You want him to forget his baby? Jesus! I know she may be awful, but you knew what you were getting into. You need to be supportive of him being a daddy. And, if he left his first baby mama, well, you may just be baby mama #2 in a long line of baby mamas- so choose wisely. And why buy the cow if the millk's free? For real. Whats wrong with getting married first? Being stable? Giving a child a better chance at success at life than you had? <br>  <br>  It doesn't sound like you are ready to be married to a man with kids, or ready to be a mom. Hate her all you want, but don't take it out on his baby.|`|U6C4Bywwaa	its obviously you with the issues. Not the boyfriend OR the baby moma. Youre extremely jealous even though they both seem reasuring. You dont trust him, and in the end, it will be your jealousy that ends t he relatinship. I would suggest that you do no get pregnant b/c he will never "forget" his firt child and its selfish of you to want him to?|`|W6S6WpsNaa	First off... How old are you? It sounds like you need to grow up!  He will NEVER forget the baby that he made with her.  He will be tied to her for the rest of his life.  So if you don't like it, then move on!  Sounds like you are just a jealous *****!|`|paHbLR9aaa	Sounds to me like you have a jealousy problem.  If they have a child together, she's not going to just go away.  If you can't deal with her, then you shouldn't be with him.|`|xCfHnQBbaa	Whoa, dont get pregnant just to try to tie him down.  He is never going to forget his kid.  You need to relax sweetie!|`|kC7U3VK8aa	you need to accept her or get another boyfriend|`|hIzQyflqaa	are u the same one who was going on about her breastfeeding? get a life and grow up!|`|ESAM0U7xaa	SEEK HELP! what's wrong with you and how old are you!?!?! how could u ever say you don't want him to ever have anything to do with his child. <br>  this situation is obviously to much for you to handle and it's time to MOVE ON!!! it's not gonna get any better and he will be dealing with the ex for a very long time. <br>  it brings me great joy to see my bf have the relationship with his son that he has! it's so awesome. and i know he loves me....the ex is in the past and i have accepted my situation. we are actually trying for a child now...but i would never do it to get him to change or move on from his past life.<br>  <br>  i'm sorry this may all seem harsh, but brutally honest! that's what u get when you ask questions on here, esp when you want a real answer and the truth from me!<br>  <br>  my guess is your young.....find a good guy that will take care of your needs and wants. he is out there!!!|`|VPsDptrraa	Ugh... tough one! I think you need pro counseling, but I'll try! <br>  <br>      This is a case of pure jealousy. She's doing you a favor, by delivering your baby, so you should be nice to her, and give her respect. If you give respect, she will give you respect.<br>      If she is only just became pregnant, I would suggest asking your boyfriend to not invite her over as much, or not talk to her as much as before, but I suggest being nice, even if you can't stand it, try to deal with the fact your boyfriend is with another woman, not really though, but technically. Don't worry, its only for not even a year. Hey, at least he didn't have to have sex with her!<br>  <br>  H?pe I helped!<br>   tee?h<br>  <br>  And at least he still ? you!|`|FAiCdPcVaa	Whatever you do, do not have a baby with him until this is straitened out!  He will not forget about her baby, and you shouldn't want him to, it's his hid too!  If he just cut his kid out of his life, that would make him a bad father.  Just try talking to him about how you feel.  He needs to keep some kind of relationship with his baby's mom, but only for the sake of the child.  Tell him for the sake of his relationship with YOU he needs to only have the baby's mom around you when it comes to parenting, not to just 'hang out'.|`|AA12370001	Sounds like you have more of the problem.  Since he has a baby with this woman, he will know her the rest of his life!  So if you want to be with him, you better get used to her.  How do you expect him to be a good father and simply forget about his other baby? <br>  <br>  If you have children with him, then that baby who's mother you hate, will be your childs half-brother or sister!<br>  <br>  You better grow up or get out of the relationship because the relationship comes with HIS baby and the baby's mother!|`|96HWpdkFaa	It's his child...that's terrible to want a childs father to forget about them.<br>  <br>  Maybe you don't get along with the mother...but don't try and hurt the child because of it.|`|CkecSp4Uaa	You seek professional counseling.  Seriously.  He's clearly not going to stop being a part of his child's life (good on him) and that includes being at the very least civil to his child's mother.  She's not going to stop being part of his life anytime soon.  Even if he stops seeing his child and his child's mother he's not going to forget because you better believe he'll be hit with child support payments.  If it bothers you this much then your only two options are to stop seeing your boyfriend and choose another man who doesn't have any baggage (ie a child with a former girlfriend) or get professional help to help you deal with your feelings.|`|41750b9e94be3f10bf789863a1a3a228aa	relax!<br>  They are having a baby, this is a huge deal.  they need to be there for each other.  If you can't handle that then you need to leave him.  <br>  If you love him and want to stay then buck up, be a big girl and trust it when he says he wants to be with you and not her.  I know it must be hard, but be the bigger person here and think about that baby.  Don't cause drama for that little one he/she didn't ask to be born to these people, don't make it his/her fault.  Good Luck!|`|5yAsj29Vaa	You're pretty immature to think the way you do.  Grow up and get a life.  You need to drop the drama and mind your own business.  They have a child together; deal with it!  You should be proud your man takes care of his kid and treats their mom with respect; he's not a douche like so many other fathers out there.  He deserves better than you.|`|uuHPneEcaa	hun if thats his child. u cannot  make him forget about his other child.. Its not fair. U just have to get over the fact that she is going to be there for 18 years sorry.. <br>  <br>  my baby's father was married when I got pregnant and still is (i didn't know about her) his wife and I are okay with each other cause we don't have a choice we have babies by the same man. and he doesn't concider my child his yet until he is born. I didn't ask to have a baby by him it just happened.. u are thinking of the wrong reason to get pregnant sweetie.. seriously.  because that is like me say hey u need to get  a divorce some stay with me and our baby and let us get married and u forget about u other two babies and ur ex wife cause u have me now. Thats really selfish.. <br>  <br>  So ur just gonna have to deal with it. Sorry to be like I am that is how I see it. <br>  <br>  Sorry u can't make him forget about his child... and if u think she is being fake nice. let it roll off ur shoulders he's ur man now.<br>  <br>  if u can't get over the fact that she is going to be around maybe u too should end it until u can get over the fact that child comes before u.<br>  <br>  why am i getting thumbs down.. i am telling her from past experiance.  Its okay doesn't bother me any its you alls opiion not mine.|`|vOFdHvlvaa	God u really need grow up, i just answered another of ur ?'s were u thought breastfeeding was yucky and weird, and that his babymomma shouldn't breastfeed or should wait til u leave.  And it's very immature of u to want to have a baby just so that he'll forget about his first child, and very cruel too.  Grow up already.  And u either need to learn to trust ur bf or u need to break up with him.  Trust is a essential part of any realtionship and if u don't have it, then ur relationship isn't very good.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Sorry but 18 is still pretty young, and age really has nuttin to do with this, it's ur maturity level that has everything to do with it.  I'm only 17, but much more mature than u are.  U are being extremely immature about this whole situation.<br>  Sorry to burst ur bubble but we are giving u real answers, they just aren't answers that u wanna hear.  And most of the advice u got was very good advice, but all u want is for someone to completely agree with u.  U don't really want real advice.  We are tryin to help, but ur being too immature to see that.|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	wow. you need to either grow up or stop dating this guy. your maturity level was evident just in your question when you refer to her as "baby momma". The mother of your boyrfriend's child is doing nothing wrong. She HAS to be in contact with the father for the sake of the child, and the fact they have a good relationship is IMPERATIVE to the well-being of the child. Who cares if she is "fake nice" to you? At least she is being cordial- there is no rule that says she HAS to like you. <br>  <br>  What do you do you ask? Like I said, either grow up or date a man that does not have a child. PERIOD.|`|bebee00e4f3a4e5d156594de8d4a527eaa	You don't need to do anything. She will always be in his life,they have a child together. But he is not together with her,and if you go on letting her get under your skin,then that is on you. If she's fake,yeah so what. <br>  <br>  But you are delusional if you think getting pregnant will make him forget about his other child. Doesn't work that way at all.|`|E5CnUdhsaa	your an immature schmuck<br>  <br>  first of all your pissed as going by your last Q on here because her baby has the nerve to breastfeed<br>  <br>  now your just being petty! what is wrong with you? if you cant handle it and leave your boyfriend. find someone that is not tied down....damn like i said before if you were my daughters daddy gf id be livid mortified and would refuse entry into my house infact you wouldnt be near my child with that attitude and bitterness|`|UdtzY5ciaa	Yes, that is a wonderful reason to have a child.   I'd really suggest ending this relationship.  There is very little trust here.<br>  <br>  ------------<br>  Edit: 18 is not young?|`|AA10153923	Sorry hun, this is an immature reason to want to get pregnant.<br>  He should NEVER forget his baby if hes caring for him/her.<br>  I would think twice..... Your not ready to have a child, sorry<br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT: Your 18, your too YOUNG.Your being really immature.<br>  We can NOT answer your question because your question is about MATURITY.<br>  The father of my baby has another girl with a child.<br>  I need to deal with her for the rest of my life even if I like her or not. I am NOT even with the father of my child, <br>  but they are BOTH in my life FOREVER.<br>  How would you like it if he abandoned your child for the other one? Horrible right? How would YOUR child feel?<br>  <br>  You need some counseling, what your thinking is SO incorrect, and abut 30 people have told you today, THIS IS WRONG. I am not trying to be mean, just telling you the truth.<br>  I hope you way of thinking changes.<br>  <br>  DEAL WITH IT this is the man you chose.<br>  <br>  <br>  Yes, like someone said on here, RE READ what you said in a couple years, you will be ashamed of yourself.|`|WPI0Z47saa	Even if you did get pregnant with his child that doesn't mean that he will forget hers. If it is really that hard for you to deal with then maybe you should reconsider your relationship. She will always be in his life somehow since they have a child together and it is very selfish of you to want him to not be involved in his childs life which right now includes her since it is a baby. Seriously try to get a hold of yourself and except it or you need to move on. This would not be a healthy environment for you to purposely bring another child into as long as you are acting that way.<br>  <br>  EDIT: You did get real answers for both of your questions. You just can't see what the right thing to do is. Reread what you wrote in about 5 years and see how silly your question really was. You don't like the answers because that is not what you WANT to hear.|`|kGkUG0fKaa	Umm..it is his child's mother. they should be friends...duh! and you dated him knowing he had a child and a child's mother so why complain. Shut up and deal with it or get a childless boyfriend. I am  friends with my sons father and I will be damnned if some lil chick he dated did not like me. She would be highly disappointed because we have a child together and can't stand each other to be in a relationship but for the sake of our child we r friends and talk about everything from life to his relationship issues...deal with and quit whinning!

nkSRIq0Iaa	She's exploring her world! It's fun to make a big noise in a room full of people. If you don't encourage her to do it ( positively or negatively ) she'll get bored sooner or later and move on to something else. My 12 month old's current favorite is sticking out her tongue and making fart noises.|`|olF9Hl6saa	My son used to do the exact thing too. Not screaming as in crying... just being loud. I used to say that he just liked the sound of his own voice. He's 4 now... and I still say that. It sounds like she is just testing out her voice. It could be that her voice echos different in the resturant. Or maybe it gets attention from nearby people.|`|cHROCt3Aaa	my daughter is 2 and she still does this. she is just loud. she's like that everywhere. you can't make them be quiet.|`|P1xlrvAaaa	Can you possibly add more info to this?Does this happen only when she is eating??????|`|7kaHDPnRaa	You honestly cannot do too much about this.<br>  You can try by disciplining her somehow with a punishment or something.<br>  I know that when i was a baby, i would always cry and scream really loud. Once, we even got thrown out of a taxi.<br>  But, once the kid is old enough to understand, she should eventually stop.<br>  Try disciplining her and awarding her when she doesnt.<br>  If it gets worse, talk to a psychiatrist or a psychologist.<br>  hope i helped and good luck! :D|`|5ZwIASCgaa	My son is 11 months and does the same thing he doesnt do it all the time but sometimes he does it he aint mad he just screams..the first time i was horrified lol but now me and my husband just try to entertain him and take his mind away from screaming...Good Luck|`|RlGkf0C8aa	Not sure if this is the same thing or if your daughter is really upset but our one year old son has just started 'talking' at the top of his lungs whenever and wherever he feels like it! He's not screaming or upset, just exercising his new foundd voice. We tend not to worry about it too much although he does get really, really loud We try to shush him a bit but we really don't make much of a deal over it because if he realises it gets a reaction then he will do it more! I guess they just get over it in time. In the meantime, we have started going to very family friendly restaurants or if we are going to a nice place in the evening, he stays at home with Nanna or Aunty. Don't worry about it too much though, anyone who has ever had a child will look at you in sympathy.|`|zlGb9NkZaa	you may be right. give her as little attention as possible when she does that. my 1 yr old does this sometimes, and she used to be worse. we started ignoring it mostly and just saying "shh" & frowning at her briefly & she only does it now if she IS bored out of her mind (or is trying to get someone's attention at a different table--usually another baby).<br>  <br>  until you get her to stop, go to family friendly restaurants where no one will bat an eye at a screech or two :)|`|WgyGipBMaa	Hmm to young for discipline, just try to to take her anywher fancy? lol good luck eventually she'll grow out of it or she'll understand its a no no
pzLDXL6gaa	It could just be that it's the start of your period, but some women say early pregnancy symptoms are the same as PMS symptoms.<br>  <br>  You could definitely get a positive result after 4 weeks, so go and buy a test. Best to take it in the morning (first morning urine) for the most accurate result. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Harriet|`|MigBOiUPaa	yea u should take a test it should show up by now..|`|k9VvIG3gaa	Early pregnancy symptoms are kind of like PMS symptoms,so its hard to tell that way, after 4 weeks you would be able to take the HPT (home pregnancy test) with the morning pee (so first pee of the day) and it will tell you if you are pregnant or not,and if it sais you are pregnant,go to the Dr, so they can do a proper test..just to be sure, because HPT aren't 100% accurate.|`|gA22md42aa	I got so hungry and thirsty a lot but that was at 6weeks :(<br>  <br>  Oh i know i used to have these really semi-tight abs. then at my 4th week i saw a blubbery -ness thought of working out but started the workout laziness at 2weeks pregnant.  preferred to sleep in a lot.<br>  <br>  I know lots of girls don't usually work out like me so i guess you have to see about your normal habits and see if anything changes?<br>  <br>  take a test either way.|`|Bw18seFqaa	the first pregnancy symptoms are similar the PMS symptoms..  many women do not know they are pregnant until they miss their period and take a test.<br>  <br>  Get a home test kit and test yourself in the next week or two.|`|l1STgPyRaa	get a test and that should be able to tell you now days.|`|QinqWfXOaa	If you are pregnant, it is possible to take a preg test as soon as 11 days after conception (which may not even be the same day as the sexual encounter) and get a positive.  You do not necessarily have to wait until you miss your period!  <br>  Don't take one too soon and get a false negative though.|`|4VIjILk1aa	Yes you will be able to take a test now. Yes signs can start at four weeks. If you have unprotected sex you always have a chance on being pregnant. Cramping with out a period is a major sign on being pregnant.|`|GAIGewp2aa	with a regular home pregnancy test you can usually tell just before or just after your missed period, which I'm guessing would be around now.<br>  <br>  sorry about your craps.|`|XrKviWgSaa	yeah you should be able to tell now, take a test with your first pee of the day it will give you the best results
6qh6sRX9aa	Start immediately. There's no such thing as too young to learn.<br>  <br>  The absolute, single most important thing is to teach your children about financial literacy. Invest in Robert Kyosaki's "Rich Dad, Poor Dad". Its a fantastic book.<br>  <br>  Also, teach them that drugs are wrong and WHY they're wrong. Explain what the consequences are, instead of just saying "because I told you so". <br>  <br>  Teach them that recreation is a privilege, not a right. They have to do their work (home work, chores, etc) before they get to have fun. Do not provide allowance. Provide rewards for good work/behavior but never let your children believe that they get something just because they have a 'right' to it. That is why we have so many free-loaders in our society..<br>  <br>  Also, instill in your children respect. Respect for the law, respect for other people, and respect for themselves. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :-)|`|G2auAv1Saa	You start teaching when they are born by your actions. <br>   love, respect, responsibility, manners, religion, morals|`|YmEGCGtnaa	love, compassion, hard work|`|xIowgWL7aa	Teaching starts at birth. Its not always like a lesson, but its the way you talk to your child, the way they see you interact with others, how you treat other people and your opinions. Children like to parrot whatever they hear their parents say and sometimes the strangest things come out of the littlest mouths, so you have to be careful at all times.<br>  <br>  It also has to be age appropriate. Discussing the perils of sex and drugs with a toddler will get you a blank stare. And it helps if your child sees it at home. Lecturing a child about drinking while holding a glass of wine in your hand is not the best way to go. Ditto for smoking.<br>  <br>  As a parent, it seems that a lot of this comes naturally. You have the instinct to protect your child and you will learn what you child can understand and what needs to be explained in even more detail.<br>  <br>  There is really no set time table, but be prepared to answer questions as they arise. Being honest and truthful goes a long way.|`|1KIwM1uOaa	With kids the best way to teach is to teach by example.<br>  <br>  Teach your kids that they have to respect themselves and others above anything els.  If they do not have self respect or respect for others they are going to be lonely bitter people in life.<br>  <br>  Second they have to know you have to work to get anything in life.  No matter what you ay think nothing in life is free.  <br>  <br>  Talk to them from the time they start school about drugs and peer pressure and that is ok to stand up and say no.  In fact it isharder to say no and be different than it i to just go alon with it but it makes them a better person.<br>  <br>  If you and their father love them, take time for them, play with them, let them see you work hard, sacrafice your wants for others, be responsible etc then your children will.  If you let them grow up handing them it all and making excuses for their bad behavoir then they will expect it al through life.|`|LQqTQYYZaa	--Respect--respecting other people and appreciating people who they are in the inside but not in how they look like.<br>  --Manners--Being polite and being respectful to people.<br>  --Talk to them about drugs and sex and teach them the bad outcomes of it.<br>  --Let them be involved in a lot of after school actitives.<br>  --Go to church--learning about God, and how we should live our lives.<br>  <br>        Teach them as soon as you can.|`|xRpZ9nmfaa	if you show those things in the things you do and they sees how it positively it affects your life they will follow

It took me months to tell my ex fiance that I miscarried his child. We all heal in our own time and sometimes we need to do it on our own. I'm so sorry for your loss and I wish you luck in the future.|`|NNwEuC8paa	If you didn't have a miscarriage then yes it is wrong. If you did have one then I guess its okay to tell him, but why would you tell him that if you didn't even tell him you were pregnant?|`|kT7GVOosaa	did you have a miscarriage? if so then no, if you didn't have a miscarriage then yes.|`|079d2408b404792068cec1c2e4eb8488aa	I don't think so at all. I know that he was the father but at the same time its your body and you are the one having to deal with the physical as well as emotional pain. Not saying he doesn't have to deal with it emotionally, but at times lets face it we are the mothers and that attachment we have no one can replace. I wouldn't feel bad for waiting. You had to wait until you were ready, nothing wrong with that.|`|ESAM0U7xaa	not really...maybe you needed some time to process it! your the one that goes thru the hormonal changes and most of the emotions! even if you weren't planning, it is still hard to accept. what you should always remember is a women loves the child thru the whole pregnancy...the man usually doesn't love the child until he see's him/her for the 1st time. the woman has the instant bond!|`|POGZZmoUaa	If you told him you were pregnant and then miscarried, he needed to know.  It was his loss too.

Shoes for me and my husband are name brand and last longer.  For the kids they get cheap brands or nice ones only if they are on clearence.  They outgrow them so fast or get them filthy so its not worth the extra cost.  We buy generic on alot of food but some things you can tell the difference.  When it comes to shredded cheese you cant tell walmart brand from kraft but when it comes to things like bacon if you dont get the name brand you will be eating nothing but fat and no bacon.   Basically just depends|`|ge3meKYEaa	Quality- and I only buy american made items.<br>  <br>  I shop in Macy's and Bloomingdale's because they have factory audits that prevent child slave labor.  Walmart is a terrible place.|`|AA10730513	It is your way of showing your appreciation and supporting their efforts to spread the word about their wonderful products. Taking 4 minutes out of your favorite tv show doesn't come cheap you know. It's only fair that you repay them for the favor.<br>  <br>  Sometimes the brand name is better. Often it's pretty much the same. And every now and then you will even find something where the store brand is better!<br>  <br>  Laundry detergent seems to be one of those things where it's good to have a box of tide around in case you have an extra dirty load. And the very cheapest stuff sometimes seems weak in comparison. But if you get the mid-price stuff (I spend $3 - $5 on a bottle of laundry detergent) it gets the job done. <br>  <br>  Clothes - My $50 pair of Reeboks last about twice as long as my $20 walmart shoes and are way more comfortable. They were a good investment. And my $20 jeans are much more durable and fade resistant than the $5 pair I got from the dollar store.<br>  <br>  Food - I actually prefer the store brand of corn flakes. And milk and eggs seem to be about the same no matter what brand you get. <br>  <br>  Electronics - I will be sticking with the name brands for a while due to some bad experiences. But I have friends that think the cheapo stuff is ok. (2 exceptions: There is nothing wrong with my Duraband brand stereo and DVD player that goes in the car. ... But my Durabrand brand DVD player that hooks up to the tv has been a big of a disappointment due to its lack of features compared to my grandmother's RCA.)|`|J7Mmo5Xmaa	Hope you get something out of this hon.<br>  Years ago I bought cheap tennis shoes.One day I saw a pair of converse shoes.They had the bottoms sewed on, nice cushion insoles,arch supports, and they were 20$(this was before they got athletic endorsements that they used to jack the price up sky high).<br>  I could have bought a cheap pair for 5$.I was on my feet a lot so I bought the converse they lasted me a year and I walked on concrete.They were comfortable.After a while they got to be too high 40 a pair then up and up and up a,d the quality went down the toilet.<br>  The cheap shoes were made as good as the converse and still are.<br>  I buy the Dr. scholls, they aren't made as well as the old converse, but they are pretty comfortable and they last long enough for what I use them for.<br>  Look at the quality, if the price isn't much more, and the quality is as good, save yourself some money, the name brand is just that,a name.Usually once a company makes a name for itself, the quality goes down to the toilet to make the product cheaper and they jack the price up so the CEO'S can give themselves a large salary increase and the investors a bigger dividend.While the public pays a "brand name price" for chinese made junk.|`|1VdgsZPoaa	On occasion you are getting a better purchase.  I have always loved Apple products because IMO they were always of a better quality.<br>  <br>  I don't understand Hollister though, their clothes are flimsy and scampy.  I wouldn't pay $50 for a shirt that won't even last me a full summer.<br>  <br>  I also like Tide, I think that is a good laundry detergent.  Sometimes it depends on what we are raised on, have used all our lives, and feel comfortable with.  Other wear/use brand names to fit in or show they have money.|`|KRQtXHwIaa	I think it depends on the item. I pay brand name for diapers, the generic ones are awful in my opinion. When my kids moved to formula they were on generic walmart brand. Most of my groceries I buy generic, and I buy Sun or Extra laundry detergent, because I can get a bottle twice the size then tide and for less money. I have four kids and a husband so I have to cut corners where I can :)|`|Kyiwqxdmaa	Usually you are just paying for the name, the namebrands advertise so they need to get more income from the product then store brands that don't.  You can try the store brand, if you like it save money that way, there will always be some things you will get name brand because they are better, but not many.  Great way to save money!|`|hul6O9Nlaa	I'm sorry but for clothes, baby stuff,  they are better. I really believe in the you get what you pay for saying. Anything I've gotten at crappy Walmart seriously breaks on me.  Those little indian childrens hands making stuff just dont compare to the more expensive brands LOL.  Now for laundry detergent thats a different story, go for whats cheaper!|`|x8cCRkBaaa	It depends on the product. As for clothes, I don't buy designer but I do buy name brand like Nike and Old Navy for my son and I. I do shop at ALDI, Food 4 Less, and Fairplay because they sell their groceries cheaper than big name supermarkets.|`|TvBwvGuUaa	we get clothes from walmart and they are nice but cheap. laundry soap, i wont negotiate on it, we get ALL brand. its too easy to get rashes from stuff like that. body wash and stuff has to be name brand in my house, and so do diapers (or he leaks through em).|`|iWuMOPXIaa	It is all just a label.<br>  <br>  I always get the off brand products. I  save TONS of money and it works just as good.|`|q84KT11saa	I think it really depends.  You have to look at a lot of things when you are buying clothing.  Like first of all, the stitching.  Is it holding the fabric together nicely or does it pull apart a bit.  Are there any loose threads.  Will it shrink in the wash.  Does it require any special care.  Was it pre-washed, what fabric was used to make the item.  Lots of things to think about.  Personally, I find bran names are ridiculously  expensive for what you get.  I think they have some nice clothes, don't get me wrong.  Just beyond my budget when something a quarter of the price will do the same job and last just as long.  Keep in mind you can also have the opposite problem.  If you go to cheap, then you can end up getting clothes that are made with a bad fabric, fade easily, fall apart easily, etc.  <br>  <br>  As for other products like laundry detergent or food items, the name doesn't mean anything.  You really have to try them and go with what you think works the best.  I get an environmentally friendly laundry detergent along with Gain.  The environmentally friendly one is twice the size and half the price of detergents like Tide.  I must say though, I buy Gain because I LOVE the smell of it.  I use it on my clothes.  Its like my treat.  Gain Joyful Expressions . .I can smell it now.  Things like soup, I always get a name brand if I don't make it myself.  I find you can taste the difference in the non-name brand soup.  Same goes with a multitude of other things.  Some things are fine substitutes . . like Kidney Beans.  I can get a can of Kidney Beans and I have never had an issue with the cheaper product vs the name brand.  <br>  <br>  So what it comes down to is doing your research and testing these things out.  Fancy name brands really are not always top quality.  I have had just as many name brand clothing fall apart in the wash as I have cheap clothing.  So its really personal preference =)|`|TQW5E6olaa	It depends on the item. Personally, I just have brands I like that I stick with. For the most part, i look at the quality. Clothing, at Bella's age, we do mostly Target and Carters with a good mix from Macy's. I just don't feel I should spend a ton of money on clothes she won't wear long. <br>  <br>  Cotton balls, paper products are used and thrown away, I don't need to spend a ton there.<br>  <br>  Detergents and soaps, I've tried some different ones and have found I like the brands better. It's a personal preference more than anything.<br>  <br>  I also get the recall emails and have noticed a trend there. For example, kids items from Walmart frequently violate lead paint standards.

4RjM5lElaa	Here is a snippit of what I found and the link is noted on the bottom, hope it helps!<br>  <br>  Most sleepwear made from synthetic fiber is polyester and according to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC), "less than 1% of either polyester or cotton sleepwear garments are treated with flame retardant chemicals." The key word here is "treated," which, in this case, does not mean exactly what one might suppose. Treated or not, most children's sleep clothes made of synthetic fabrics will contain flame retardant chemicals in one way or another. In some cases, the material is treated after it is woven or after the garment is finished; in other cases, the flame retardant is actually bonded into the composition of the fabric. Therefore, the most chemical-free (as well as comfortable) option is untreated, snug-fitting cotton stretchies. But it's crucial to note that they must be snug-fitting in order to comply with government safety rules.<br>  <br>   <br>  <br>  Chemicals used on pyjamas or pyjama fabrics include halogenated hydrocarbons (chlorine and bromine), inorganic flame retardants (antimony oxides) and phosphate based compounds, all of which are the basic building blocks of most conventional fire retardants.  Like all fabric finishes, fire retardants can off-gas into the air children breathe and irritate their skin.  For purposes of the CPSC, synthetic materials are either considered to be "inherently" flame resistant or treated with flame retardants. Materials not requiring treatment include most polyesters, modacrylic (Verel, SEF, Kanecaron); matrix (Cordelan); and vinyon (Leavil).  However, "inherently" flame resistant polyester textiles are manufactured with built-in fire retardants.  This is because the fire retardants can be chemically inserted into the polyester compound, becoming a part of its molecular composition.  The enhanced polymers are quite stable, so polyester sleepwear is unlikely to pose a health risk to your child, beyond the reduced breathability of the fabric, which can contribute to overheating and rashes.  And one can also consider the negative impact on the environment during its manufacture from petrochemicals.

hLQa3VtYaa	Yup, you could definitely be pregnant. If you miss your period go to the store and buy a pregnancy test..... I tihnk the most likely time to get knocked up is in the middle of your cycle (2 weeks or so after your period).|`|kUCVLuTPaa	you should try again and keep your legs elevated for at least 15 minutes to allow the sperm where they need to go..I used to always have sex with my bofriend then get right up and NEVER got pregnant but once i had my legs elevated and let them go where they need to go then i got PREGNANT!!!|`|af2136bcacd19dc5b2bab9b0737163c9aa	check your fertile days.. www.babycenter.com if it shows you were fertile on the day this happened you have a good chance of being pregnant. either way theres always those crazy times when it can just happen considering you had unprotected sex even if you go wipe or clean yourself there is still sperm left behind inside you its impossible to "clean it all out" . good luck! you can find out up to 5 days before you are expecting your period or if you get a blood test done those can be done a few days after conception and get and accurate answer..|`|vdXnvJwMaa	it only takes one sperm cell to get pregnant, and there are thousands of sperm cells per teaspoon of sperm no matter what color or consistency.  Once inside of you it is up the where you are at in your cycle and mother nature.  Good luck, hope it works out how you want it!|`|jRSXE7BTaa	You can take a test about 14 days after you had sex.. Sooner, if you know for SURE you ovulated that day but, considering you don't, you should wait two weeks.|`|G9EJuDyGaa	Yes, it's possible.  You really can't find out until the first day of your missed period.|`|AZEeXXIXaa	It all depends which day of the menstrual cycle you are in. <br>  If you are in 1 to 10 day or 20 to 28 of cycle then you have very less chance of pregnancy.<br>  But if you are in 11th day to 20th day then chances of pregnancy are surely high.<br>  Some home pregnancy test claim that they can detect pregnancy as early as 4 days before your period starts but most of HPT are reliable if done a day or two after you miss your periods.|`|0aad97d9db05440fa56bc3fe102003b2aa	Well obviously you could be pregnant if that happened. You will have to wait until it is time for your next period to be able to take a pee test.
hjLzSGV0aa	take another test in like 2 weeks|`|soFpywFcaa	theres no telling could be a late period or just could be hcg level is low i say wait a week and take another test|`|olF9Hl6saa	I have PCOS and have been on Metformin for almost a year. My doctor said it would regulate my insulin levels/hormones and cause me to have regular cycles. It did not work! My periods are just as irregular as they were before I started taking the medication. I can completley miss 1 sometimes 2 periods in a row. My doc said that at this next appointment we will look at getting me back on the pill (I've had bad side effects from the kinds I've tried in the past). They pill can also help to regulate your system.|`|AaxIZSTwaa	I would say there is a chance you could be. For some women it takes longer to show up positive on a HPT. If you have been on metaformin for awhile and haven't had problems with it not working I would say there is definitely a chance you could be pregnant. Good luck!!!
qYeBBrYYaa	YOU SHOULD KEEP YOUR BABY BECAUSE IN THE FUTURE YOU WILL REGRET IT IF U DON'T AND I DON'T THINK HE COULD DO ANYTHING IF THE BABY DOESN'T HAVE HIS LAST NAME AND IF HE WAS NEVER THERE FOR THE BABY LET ME GET UR EMAIL TO K.I.T IF U WANT|`|Bw1h5xAcaa	Your body, your choice. He cannot do anything to you.|`|7xit1ogxaa	So, basically you are saying since you don't like your ex there is no reason for you to keep your baby?|`|AA11315360	Yes he can fight for custody of the baby too. Dont worry because courts usually give primary custody to the mother. If you keep the baby and he wants custody then he has to pay child support.<br>  Even years later if you decide you need help you can actually sue him for all the back child support even though he didnt know about the baby.<br>  If he isnt a violent guy then I suggest you tell him you are pregnant and it might be his.|`|fUK9y3Qkaa	So your having an abortion because you can't count on him. That makes no sense and it's kind of pathetic. You dont need him to help you raise the baby. I raised my first on my own. I would have never thought of having an abortion. Y is it that you would rather KILL the baby than give it up for adoption? Freaking pathetic. Abortion is not a form of birthcontrol.U dont need to be having sex if your not mature enough to accepts what come with it and take responsibility for your actions!|`|tDEiKXIQaa	There are places that can give you support and help ypou with baby items and rsources you will need call Birthright 1-800-550-4900 God Bless Congrats on your little baby.|`|Bi7i3JIEaa	First he'd have to take a paternity test to prove the baby's his, and if he wanted to keep the baby and you didn't he can fight you in court for full custody and try to have your parental rights terminated, this would make it so that you have nothing to do with the baby, however you can have an amnio done for them to determine paternity, and try have his rights terminated however you would have to prove that he would not make a good father|`|xGlqXMRAaa	From what you've said so far he doesnt sound like he would be very interested but you never know.  As far as doing anything to you legally no he can't the worst he could do is give up the rights to the baby, basically making him not liable at all, in other words no child support etc.  Of course you would have to consent to this but their is always a lot of grey area when it comes to these situations.  If you really don't want him to have anything to do with the baby, don't even name him as the father, give the baby your last name and move on with your life.  But remember raising a child by yourself can be a tough thing theirs a million women that do it beautifully, but it is hard so just make sure that its what you want truly. Good luck and congratulaions.

NI8D46J0aa	I was about 6 weeks with my first one, and I had several drinks on several occasions before I found out I was pregnant. everything was fine.  I think you're fine.|`|LMc23g9Maa	You will if you carry on like that!  At 5 weeks, there is the start of organ formation so that should be your warning.|`|uhUUn246aa	Like many other unexpected mums to be - this is common - even i, myself has been in a similar situation. When i found out i was pregnant - i freaked (not at the news) but because i had been partying in the previous weeks. So i did some research and read up on it - generally provided you stop drinking alcohol, caffine, smoking and taking drugs (party drugs etc) you should be fine, especially because you found out so early in your pregnancy (you're about 4-5weeks right?) i think you should be fine. Just get all the normal check up's (ie blood tests scans etc) with your doctor and stay relaxed and healthy you and your lil bub should be fine!<br>  <br>  Best wishes.|`|81dd15df4b71774a4d8192add4bcb9caaa	I was in the same position when I found out I was pregnant. The doctor gave me the best advise by saying what you did before your pregnancy has to be written off because you can't change what you did... all that matters now is what you do after you are aware you are pregnant. There is no real way to know if your actions will play have any effect on the baby until it arrives. Worrying about something you can't change will only cause unnecessary stress. |`|zPwpHfXgaa	No Your Fine Sweetie Just Try To Limit Your Caffeine Intake.

I was almost 6 weeks pregnant and spotting and they told me I was going to miscarry.  So I drank that night when I was out.  And the next night!  Turns out... I was NOT miscarring and now I'm 16 weeks pregnant and the baby is fine.  My doctor said it's absolutely fine.  It happens all the time.  And she's certain no damage is caused.  I was drinking when before I found out I was pregnant as well.  After reading so many google searches... I have yet to find ONE person who said it caused damage.  Do not worry.  And Congratulations!  :)|`|Zy56XB9eaa	it'll be fine. i think it happens to most people. you can't avoid everything in the lead up to getting pregnant. it takes some people years to get pregnant. imagine if they avoided alcohol and caffeine for that long?!  <br>  Good luck, and congratulations!|`|JI7Zwtitaa	just stop drinking fast. one of my best friends is a midwife so i know. you probably won't have caused any damage.

3QJZqEy7aa	Never go by online calculators - everyone is different,  I tested for over 2 years and ovulated between day 10 and day 14,  so  i would say having unprotected sex at anytime during the month means there will always be the chance there.<br>  <br>  Also what I found was - have sex frequently throughout the month,  having sex only around the time of ovulation does reduce the chances of becoming pregnant.<br>  <br>  Also bear in mind that each cycle you try you have a 20-30% of chance of becoming pregnant and for many couples it takes many months (or even years in my case).|`|215dfe0c283eb141a2ed0b4dcb32274caa	If you ovulated somewhere closer to November 9 and BD on November 10 then you have a good chance of conceiving because the egg will be there waiting to be fertilized. Or you missed the window because you ovulated closer to the beginning of ovulation, Nov 4. So it's unknown. If you know the exact day of ovulation...say by using OPKs or checking cervical mucous it could be determined better. Good luck!|`|P03VfBFAaa	if you ovulated between the 4th-10th you probably missed....because according to the online calendars you probably ovulated on the 8th....anywho lots of baby dust to you

484fd75888bbb282b3da584ad880893aaa	Use it as a middle name instead, or use the initials as inspiration for another name - for instance Jacob Ryder, or Jason Ryan.

mDm8yFcMaa	I have the Chicco Cortina Travel System and I really love it! It is on the bigger side but I have no problems getting around in stores or getting it in/out of my Honda Accord. You can buy the stroller separately if you don't need the car seat. Here are the features that I like: very comfy for baby and it reclines flat for napping, it has a decent sized adjustable canopy to keep the wind & sun out of baby's face, it has shocks in the wheels so it has a very smooth ride over rough surfaces and it is good looking as well. The stroller is about $160 so it has a pretty good price point. The stroller seat is made out of fabric not a plasticy material for hot weather.|`|X6as2nOAaa	Go search online at different stores or go into walmart and get one.|`|p1sB578jaa	i went to albeebaby.com and got a stroller cheaper than what i found at babiesrus (even after i paid shipping it was over $10 savings) i also got another double stroller, much cheaper and car seat from them.<br>  <br>  graco is great durable and reasonably priced and some cute patterns as well.|`|3vzxSKLcaa	Do NOT buy Evenflo- it is a brand I bought from Target, and it was an $130 system and it broke with in the first two weeks.

She's 7 years old right now and has been like this since she was 4.<br>  BTW i really like the name Lillian it's so cute, and i really like Lily as a nickname for Lillian, cuz it's adorable.<br>  And i love the name Taylor it's one of my fav girls names.<br>  The Lillian that i know has a bad middle name lol, it's Francesca and i don't like it at all, nor do i think it works well with the name Lillian.   <br>  Lillian Taylor is a much cuter name than Lillian Francesca IMO anyways lol.<br>  Hope this helps, :D.|`|C8E3fe3xaa	Lilly Taylor Brown|`|r5UfVeYbaa	i like the spelling Lilly better it's classier!!<br>  Lilly Taylor Brown is my favorite lillian is a bit old to go with taylor!!<br>  i picture a smart, friendly,perky, confident, popular, beautiful, athletic little girl. I see brown or blonde hair, fairly pale skin and blue or green eyes|`|miFe45quaa	I love the name Lily.<br>  Lillian Taylor Brown is gorgeous. Lily Taylor doesn't sound right.<br>  Lillian, I picture a 20 year old female, with brown hair, expressive eyes, and just such a sweet person. Lily, I picture a little girl with pig tails, running around with a huge smile on her face. She just got a new pink dress =)|`|ylAILdcUaa	i like Lily better, it just look smore pretty.<br>  Lily Taylor Brown is gorgeous.<br>  i picture a sweet little blonde girl, with pigtails and a pink shirt with a butterfly. :)<br>  <br>  beautiful name, congrats and good luck.|`|140581050ff8e4e1837ed61c01214957aa	I prefer Lily over Lilly,<br>  Lily Taylor to Lillian Taylor, <br>  and I picture a cute blue-eyed, blonde-haired little girl. <br>  <br>  =)|`|423983e632cb60a59de566f2b6c70711aa	Lillian Taylor.<br>  Lily.<br>  Very smart and sophisticated.|`|IOQshyGMaa	A friend of mine is called Lillian but she spells her nickname Lili which I like better because the portion of the name which sounds out Lily is spelt Lili or Lilli|`|V9ddU84Iaa	I like it better with the three L's (Lilly).<br>  I like Lillian Taylor Brown better, it sounds...idk...cleaner and more finished than Lily Taylor Brown. Very elegant sounding.<br>  With Lillian, I think of a more polished, sophisticated woman. Someone who would be the really pretty boss of a company.<br>  Lily sounds a bit more like someone in a sundress. (If you're understanding what I'm saying, my mind's on metaphor and visual imagery mode)<br>  <br>  Also, with Lillian, the nickname can be Lily (or Lilly) and voila, woman in a sundress! ^^<br>  <br>  It's a very versatile name, both strong and very feminine. I don't usually like really feminine sounding names, but I think it's very lovely.|`|Rx31LHjbaa	Lily|`|DCJAMtkHaa	I personally prefer Lily.  I think it just a little cleaner.  The double 'l' is a little more cluttered in my opinion.<br>  <br>  I would pick Lillian Taylor Brown - it's gorgeous.  Lilian can sound elegant and professional as well as cute and pretty.  And you can still Lily as the nickname.  Lily is cute, but it doesn't have the same versatility.<br>  <br>  I picture someone is really intelligent.  Maybe a little shy or a little reserved.  But a total sweetheart.|`|uUjSQaEqaa	I would do Lillian because then she has a full "professional" name.  My name is Margie, but my full name is Marjorie.  I like having a longer name to sign documents, use when working with other professionals, and to be called for events like graduation.  I think the spelling Lily is adorable though!|`|prllht3vaa	Lily<br>  Lily Taylor Brown<br>  I picture a sweet, pretty, cute little girl. A good girl in school, and a girl that can follow directions, i kinda person. <br>  <br>  :)|`|eFbpSF9Caa	I like Lily, It looks prettier<br>  I also like Lillian Taylor Brown. That way she can go by Lillian or Lily.<br>  I picture someone would be a senator- someone who's fair and kind<br>  <br>  Good Luck|`|6f54cfe561a33f4d3976270a0c53628caa	Lily for a nickname Lillian as the first name. And seriously I don't see how you can picture a person just by the name (guess no 10 points for me, oh well!)|`|pl7lWGZDaa	I love Lillian. I prefer Lillie over both of those spellings, but I like Lily alson.|`|W2JUHdSfaa	how bout lillie<br>  itd be unique without being a stupid pretentious name<br>  <br>  I like lillian taylor brown<br>  I picture a sort of<br>  sweet and shy, but hardworking type of girl|`|5IcWBAwwaa	lily<br>  lily taylor brown<br>  cute, girly, preppy|`|eaa2aUt0aa	I think lily is better than lilly because its spelt like the flower<br>  <br>  Lillian Taylor Brown flows better but u can still call her lily<br>  <br>  delicate and pretty|`|aJjV5b95aa	Lily<br>  Lillian Taylor Brown<br>  Someone that loves to smile and make other people laugh.|`|Rhr1umV1aa	I like it with one L.

I also like the spelling Lillie. I picture very pretty 17 year old girl, with a sweet  personality. With long blonde flowy hair down just 2 or 3 inches past her shoulders with an aqua blue t-shirt, heels, a touch of blue eyeshadow, light blush, red lipstick, and small silver hoop earrings, walking down the sidewalk of a shopping plaza.|`|aa8d66371ff46d7a821623d9f0e9c6bfaa	Lilly<br>  <br>  I think it should be<br>  Taylor Lillian Brown.<br>  <br>  I see a nice girl who has a strong head on her shoulders doesn't let others influence her often. More of a leader then a follower, possibly a cheerleader r a softball type of player n she will jus have an all around good future not 2 metion she will be a heart throb lol|`|ZvOXs61caa	lilly<br>  lillian taylor brown<br>  cute, nice , sophisticated, well behaived|`|KKo4Fctzaa	I think Lily is better<br>  Lily Taylor Brown is cool<br>  And I picture a smart, pretty girl|`|c3CVY87caa	1)  I prefer Lily.<br>  <br>  2)  Lillian Taylor Brown (let people call her Lily or Lilly if she wants)<br>  <br>  3)  I picture a short, happy girl with short blonde hair and blue eyes.  She would be a cheerleader and be very popular.  Her favorite subject would be Literature (she's an active reader) and she would absolutely despise Government and Economics classes.  She would be thin, but not anorexic looking, and be bubbly and love shopping and riding bikes.  When old enough, she will drive a sky-blue Volkwagen Beetle Convertable.<br>  <br>  hope this helps some! :)|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I like Lillian Taylor Brown best.  Of the 2 spellings I like Lily better.  I see someone cute and sweet as a little girl.  Just bubbly and easy going as an adult.<br>  <br>  Best wishes!<br>  <br>  PS I answered all 3!
52bAHCaUaa	Don't miss Dr. Phil today!<br>  <br>  It will probably answer all your questions!|`|YmEGCGtnaa	she hasn't had any problems, she just chose to freeze her embryos and get them implanted when she wanted to. she chose to not be union with the father he wanted to marry her but she wanted to be a single mom. very very weird.|`|yea2hci5aa	I'm sure she's answered that already and you can look it up on you tub by now.<br>  <br>  And also, I'm so tired of people being all over this woman.  What she did was wrong by having all those kids without the means to support them but it's too late at this point to stop her.  All the kids are here now and people should be focusing on how to help them instead of scrutinizing this woman.  <br>  <br>  Sorry, don't mean to be rude but I'm just sick of people talking about her.|`|IngripgMaa	She has said in the past Ovarian Cancer?!  But, I'm starting to think she isnt the most honest person!
9LqHgmcLaa	the only one of those rules that makes sense is charging extra if they pick them up 30-60 minutes late. if they have special dietary requirements  then provide those not bring bowls and spoons and playpen and a 2/3 year old are too big for highchairs and playpens.|`|0SIhrYCbaa	I'd prefer someone wash my dishes too, but no one will.<br>  You should charge a late fee but that's it.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	No to the first and last ones.  You should provide things like play pens, high chairs, spoons, bowls, toys, etc.  All the parents should bring is daipers, wipes, formula, and clothes.  You should wash what the children use while in your care.  To the second one, allow one warning then charge if thay are late picking up their child.<br>  <br>  EDIT: are they the only ones you watch? Then yes she should provide high chair, play pen, some toys etc.  You can pick up spoons and bowls pretty cheap but you should still wash the dishes.|`|lr9E8IC5aa	So basically your saying, I'll watch your kids but not clean up after them? Do they have to bring their own toys as well? If I took my kids to a provider that I had to bring my own high chair, I'd laugh in their face and walk out, kids in tow. Diapers, formula and wipes I can understand, but who wants to carry a highchair around all the time and why would I pay for 2 of them? That's crazy. Sounds like you want the money but don't want to earn it.<br>  <br>  I agree with charging a "late fee" but that's about it.|`|65x0vJNnaa	If you a starting a daycare business you need a contract so you and the parents have a clear understanding of what all the rules are.  You need to provide all but diapers, wipes and any special dietary needs.<br>  Make sure you are doing this because you love kids not because you need the money.|`|f271e85d3652236c7b8ad081ddef6a9daa	My daughter goes to an in home daycare and I always bring toys and a change of clothes etc. I also pack her lunch and breakfast as well as snacks. My sitter usually will wash my child's dishes but it is not something I expect her to do and would be ok with it if she did not. I guess the picking up kids late depends on your relationship with the mother, my sitter has no problem if I am running 20 min late etc. But on the other hand I pay her for holidays and days I keep my child at home. This is her job and she needs to make a living like everyone else. So I feel she deserves to be paid like me, I get paid for holidays and I earn vacation time, she should to.|`|drOXfPM6aa	The child care provider is to provide a sleeping area and the high chair. Parents should bring diapers, sippy cup, formula, or special food. You should wash the childs dish after they use it while in your care. I would charge late fees. My last provider charge $5 when late plus an additional $5 for every 30 minutes. The only time they did not do that was when it was related to traffic and you called ahead of time and they did not have plans.|`|oqbVLu1faa	I agree with the first person that you should provide the high chair, playpen, spoons, bowls, toys, diaper changing area, etc... You can find these things cheap at used children stores or on Craig's List. You should especially provide the basics if you are charging money for your services and the services are ongoing. If you are babysitting once in a while as a high school student and you don't plan on doing this for very long, you might ask the mom if she has any extra things like a restaurant booster chair the kids could use when they're at your house. Some people without kids simply don't have these things, but if you're doing it as a sort of business (advertising your services), you certainly should have the basics. If you're a friend of the family and offering to do this for them, they might be willing to help get you set up.<br>  <br>  You definitely need to wash their dishes (and their hands, faces, bottoms...) multiple times a day. Kids eat frequently and they get dirty a lot. Dishes are just part of the day, my dear. <br>  <br>  Now, charging extra when they are late is fair. It helps keep people from walking all over you. First time late gets a warning and then I might charge $5 each 15 minutes after that, so if mom shows up 1/2 hour late, it's $10 on top of what you would normally get paid (though it depends on what you're charging hourly). <br>  <br>  Most moms know enough to bring a diaper bag full of gear the kids will need for the day--diapers, wipes, extra clothes, a favorite toy, a snack (if one isn't provided at your house), etc...
LIGYejglaa	Sly - in most states, it is illegal for the hospital to withhold your medical records. If you can't get them after asking for them, I would recommend taking an attorney with you on your next visit. If you can't afford one, take a friend that looks like an attorney (but DON'T impersonate anyone that is living or dead- that's illegal too) and doesn't mind pretending to be one.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	When I inquired with the Children's Home Society, I was sent a letter that said <br>  Thank you for your recent correspondence to the Post Adoption Program of the CHS. We will respond to your request as legally allowed by the state of California and as prescribed by the adoption regulations established by the California state Department of Social Services.<br>  They sent me a packet of stuff to fill out. I received a letter thanking me for my correspondence but since my daughter had not sent in a letter of consent there was nothing they could do.<br>  My sister found a search angel who found my daughter. She sent in a consent form for info and was told that she was indeed my daughter and that was it. <br>  Also, another letter that said the CHS will provide NON-identifying background report to an adult adoptee or a birth parent upon their request.<br>  So what they were saying was we couldn't get any useful information.<br>  There is a 6 week period when my daughter was in fostercare, that nobody knows anything about.|`|NoUkTQCgaa	I was given NOTHING by Catholic Scarities, except for 21 year old non-id info which was all lies. <br>   <br>  Once I paid someone to get my obc info (illegally) I had my N Moms name. <br>   <br>  I knew that I was the only baby girl born at the hospital in which I was born, so I forged my N Mom's name on a medical release form to get my birth records, just to make sure it was her before I began my search. <br>   <br>  The only info there was the drugs she was given (probably illegal now) and my stats. That was it, only that I was called an "In-house" baby, meaning no family. :( <br>   <br>  That was 22 years ago. There is NO way I could get that info now because of HIPPA. <br>   <br>  I would love to have info about my foster parents. I was in 2 different foster homes til I was almost 6 months old. I would love to see a pic of me as a newborn, even though they probably dont have one...|`|aed5cad075214254f2f176a51206a7d7aa	Yes, I've asked for them, jointly with my mother.   They're telling us they have been 'destroyed'<br>  <br>  We don't believe them.<br>  <br>  Mom has also ask for the surrender document she supposedly signed.   They won't give her that either.|`|frpCK0utaa	i wasnt adopted through an agency, it was private. I wouldnt even know how to go about getting that information. I'd like to try, but wouldnt even know where to start.|`|RKcwfrGOaa	Yes and no.  I requested records as soon as I was 18, but it was a verbal request.  I must give them credit for immediate response time.  Immediate as in right that very moment.  However, the information I obtained was also all verbal.  The director read my file while I listened.  It was all non-identifying information.  Not only was my mother's name omitted, but every other name including the name of my foster parents, doctor, and caseworker.  I do know the name of my caseworker and foster parents.  I still have some written correspondence between my caseworker and my adoptive parents.  My amom knew my foster parents, so I know their names.  I haven't seen them in 30 years, though, and I have no idea what became of them.  The only name I don't already know is my doctor's.<br>  <br>  However, it would be really nice to have those records instead of piecing together information from various sources.  If the agency is required to provide me a hardcopy, I think I'll request one.  : )|`|UO1QE8phaa	I have requested them.  My request was denied.  I requested them again and did so in person with my a-parents (BOTH of them) in attendance.  My request was denied again and I was given the "real parents" and "ungrateful" and "birthmother privacy" speech.<br>  <br>  I requested them again, in writing, and was told that my request "would be filed against such a time as my 'birthmother' consented to the release of information about her" (which she has done, by the way, as we are in reunion and she told me -- and showed me a copy of the letters she has sent).<br>  <br>  I responded, in writing, saying that I was NOT requesting information on my MOTHER, but on MYSELF.<br>  <br>  I received the exact same letter as above in response.<br>  <br>  To date, I have received NO medical or other records regarding MYSELF or my stay in the custody of the agency (a few weeks) before I was formally adopted.  That stay included at least one return to the hospital of my birth after I was released (following my birth).  I know this because my mother was/is acquainted with the people who fostered me.  They (illicitly, tee hee) told her I had gone to hospital but would not (could not?) tell her why.  While they were fostering me, they were on "the list" to adopt with the same agency.  Guess they felt they had to "mostly" follow the rules.  They would have been un-listed had the agency ever learned they had spoken to my mother at all.<br>  <br>  *sigh*
VXhOLgDEaa	ahaha..yes I was just like you!....I liked to be in a clean environment. I hate messy cluttered rooms....it brings stress onto me like crazy!...But now that I have my daughter who is 10 mths...I can't get anything done around the house. You're right...as long as the bottles are done..and her food is steamed...I'm laying on the couch watching tv. Dirty dishes in the sink...my husbands and my laundry is overflowing...there's toys and crumbs and crap all over the floor tables....okay...it looks like a hurricane went through here....but as long as the baby's laundry ..etc.etc..is done. I do not care!? I only get to relax 1 hour for the whole day..because that's when my daughter naps....when my daughter goes to sleep at bedtime...I can barely walk...cause I'm sooooo tired. So yep that's my life.|`|pXSKSS3daa	Nope.<br>  <br>  I'm a neat freak. Was before Noah and am now.

My mother-in-law had six and did the same.  It's a matter of scheduling.  But if it doesn't both you, who cares.|`|20c96a5e1e1d8742c7835d3700704d38aa	I know how you feel. I was a nut about cleaning before my 11mo. I own every crazy cleaning tool there is. However the last time where used was before she born, LOL. She is getting more independent now and its getting easier, plus the more mobile she is, the more important it is that the floors are cleaned and that things that are easily swallowed or dangerous are kept out of reach.|`|mVD3TQkFaa	I was a neat freak to the point I'm pretty sure I may have been a little OCD! lol. My daughter is 1 month old and when she is napping I either nap with her or have some me time.

As it was i am a little messy and like seeng things neat , it relaxes me. The bathroom is shittei and i can't even get past the toilet before she wants a feed.  Better yet , shes only 40 days :0 So i pretty much feel the same way, and yeah my mom has helped so much and has allowed me to focus on baby. Eventhough i still slip and leave a mess at times...|`|ba91f39977984e4e7308c5858b127eeeaa	ya that happens. Before my first was born, i was a great green thumb, after he was born I'm lucky if store bought flowers last a week. <br>  I figure like everything else I just schedule housecleaning once or twice a week and try to clean. Its always decent not too clean and not dirty. My ocd though is the bathroom that one always has to be clean.|`|xRUZkFU9aa	Nope. How do you not have enough time to watch a baby and clean? I mean...that's all you have to do..clean, cook, watch the baby. That will definitely keep you busy during the day...but what are you doing when she naps? Sitting around or what? Clean little by little. Don't be lazy all the time because your poor husband works hard so that you can sit home..<br>  <br>  EDIT: OK then I don't blame you...you probably need a ton of sleep..Kudos to you because that is pretty tiring. Make your husband clean most of it and you clean the rest.
6gthdHpnaa	You weren't there, so you have no way of knowing what happened. It sounds to me like both the teacher and the boyfriend were somewhat at fault. It will all work out without you needing to meddle, the issue has nothing to do with you, and when you try to fix something like that, you usually do more harm than good.  Good luck!!|`|XLsnuAqmaa	who cares if your friends don't like the teacher.  that has nothing to do with you.  move on.  you can't care about what others think is what i think.|`|BU1f41Wcaa	Sounds like alot of drama that you should stay out of.
RpQfIQXmaa	let someone be a spy,like the teachers, and spy on him for a day. your 9 year old must have experienced something during school and not at the vacation. or talk to him nicely again, or send to a counselor.    the first idea maybe the best one.|`|h6NqNzHAaa	He obviously has a problem at the school. Get his to a counselor to talk about what it is. Currently he won't tell you or the school but I can promise you that it has something to do with someone or something at the school. Make him go of course, but get to the root of the problem.|`|3K1QW7Oeaa	Could be the following:    1. A bully  2. A lazy bum  3. School's too hard for him.  4. Maybe he spent so much time with mommy and daddy that he didn't want that to stop.|`|e9adf83d87be6ce67e66ff59ef0e4a91aa	Are you sure no one is harrassing him at school or doing anything that might cause him to withdraw?    When I was nine I was being sexually harrassed at school and I wasn't close enough to my parents to say something so humiliating, so I'd go to the nurse's office almost every day and just pretend I had a fever.     Make sure you know what your son is going through at school, that might take a lot of effort from your part. I'm not saying it has to be a huge problem, he might just not like spending his time there, but don't overlook this until you've figured it out.    Talk to the school psychologist, it would probably be good if you had your son sit with her/him. A child really opens up with them, and they can figure out the problem. They figured me out in less than 5 minutes.     If he's been clingy, he probably feels threatened by something, but that's only an idea. Make sure to talk to the administration.|`|BTkHkkJTaa	Maybe he is just home sick.  when i was in second grade i was fine going to school, then after a long vacation break, i started getting upset going to school because i was used to staying home during that time period.  And the problem was that i was home sick.  i used to go to the nurse and call my mom from school so i could go home.  I would have him meet with the school councilor a few times a week.  my old school councilor used to calm me down and we would take walks around the school.  it really helped.  don't worry, its just a faze he will grow out of.|`|yV8fog7Paa	he may be being bullied. I was bullied as a child and people still try to now, but I just ignore it and look to them as if I am smarter than them and they area dumba-- and don't know anything. ^^ But as a 9 year old I was bullied so bad, in tears so much. I hated school. I am clingy as well. Maybe have your son stay and help his teacher sometimes so he knows he can go to his teacher when he needs help or us upset. I always make sure I have a relationship with a teacher because they are the onyl people I want to go to when I am upset.     Counselor sounds good, but not forcing. I hated counseling when they made me go. I HATED the counselor. HATE. HATED. HATE.    Give him a big bear hug and if he feels scared or something talk to the office or something to allow him to call you during the day or just take a 20 minute break away from every one in class.|`|U531TVPOaa	My soon to be 7 yr old does that sometimes too. Or he'll cry when I tuck him in at night saying he doesn't want to go tomorrow. He did have a bully problem twice- which was not reported to my husband or I! I was really upset. Just make sure that there isn't really something going on that you don't know about. Teachers don't see everything. One time he was bullied on the bus. No one told me and then he broke down crying 2 days after. He knows he can talk to us about anything but he was still really nervous about saying what happened because he was embarrassed. It doesn't matter how "tough" your son is, it can happen to any kid. It could be that he's just clingy. I ask my son about his day at school everyday when he gets home so that if something went wrong, I'll be able to tell so.|`|YXQECboUaa	If no one knows he is obviously hiding some thing so sit him down and have a talk because something is very wrong.|`|phyttAf3aa	Go to school without him knowing and observe him for awhile.  See if he's acting normal at school or if he's acting upset.  Does the teacher say he acting different in the classroom?  Ask the school counselor to talk to him.|`|js5zxWCqaa	Hmm.  I don't know, you seemed to cover everything.  Well, tell him that if he is to stay home that his day(s) will be filled with chores and that he is not gonna sit home and do nothing.  I'm sure he'll change his mind real quick or give you an answer as to why he don't want to go.
WIEPISyeaa	I just feel bad for all her kids because she has so many and obviously doesn't have a way to take care of them all.  As for her wanting to not get rid of her embryos, I think that that is noble in it's own way--but perhaps she should've donated them or something instead of attempting to conceive them all herself?  <br>  <br>  I don't know, I'm torn...and somewhat jealous that she gets so many when we can't even seem to conceive one.....|`|Ox1vB8xwaa	I admit, I haven't heard the entire story.<br>  <br>  But if she's able to care for all of those kids, then OK.  It's her deal now.  I need to go read up on it.  Anyone have a link?<br>  <br>  It's the 15 year olds who are trying to get pregnant that bother me.  It's like, you are 15, you can't get a job or drive or support this baby, WHY are you trying to have it?!<br>  <br>  I understand accidents happen, but the ones who actively TRY make me wanna scream.  There was a girl on Tyra a few weeks back who was taking fertility drugs at age 15 just so she could have a baby.  Made me wanna cry.|`|bg3L4k0Jaa	I just think that she did it for the "OMG" factor.  You know what I mean she thought well I will have eight babies and then the press will come and I will get free stuff and people will send me money and I will be famous.  Because who in their right mind would purposely have 8 babies when they are not married and doesn't have a job and lives in a house that her parents pay for.  Or use to pay for.  I just think she did it for all the wrong reasons and it is a little depressing for the babies I think.  That is my opinion on it all.|`|tFvTW9CXaa	As Doctor I would have never agreed to do this when she already had 6 kids, which by the way one or two are actually disabled. <br>  I think this goes back to how this girl was raised and yes, I blame her parents for a big part of this! I read somewhere she had been trying to get pregnant since she was 17 in high school! CRAZY! Now she's looking for a 1.4 million dollar home in the hollywood hills? WHAT? Really? This lady is a piece of work... I know this will sound harsh but I think she is going to have those kids taken from her. And I hate to say this but I agree....they should! Look at the way she lives now.<br>  <br>  And what's this about a porno movie? WOW! NUTS! I guess yeah, she needs money to buy 8 more car seats and 8 more of everything... how if she going to travel? She will need an 18 wheeler to get the babies to their appointments and all! LOL!|`|3Rr5SAhhaa	Honestly, I think the woman is whacked!! I mean, I don't know her at all, but from what you see in the news and read about her, she just seems mentally unstable. Plus, even her existing 6 children are worried about how they will make it with 8 more. When 6 and 7 year olds are worried about things like that, that's a sign that something is wrong at home.|`|Plu6OVoGaa	She has issues! I feel so sorry for her kids to have that kind of selfish person as their mom. Her parents are no better either!<br>  <br>  She's an attention whore who'll probably be like Jon and Kate and get all her money's worth for her story!|`|BzvstX7uaa	I am disgusted by the whole situation and am tired of hearing about it lol.|`|PN7XMglOaa	The " nice " lady is about to do a porno film !! I can't believe it .|`|1NEbsemjaa	I think that a girl on welfare who lives with her parents and already has 6 children has no business having more|`|d233c5a2e4e12b8e3298613c249d71b4aa	I honestly feel that her doctor is most at fault.  I think the public and the media are blowing this way out of proportion and that everyone should just leave her alone.  I mean ET last night on tv said you won't believe the condition of her home.  Well all I saw from the clip was some crayon on the wall and some laundry out of place.  I mean, come on give her a break.  No maybe she didn't do the smartest thing but those little miracles are here and doing well and I believe that is something no short of God.<br>  <br>  There are multiple families on public aid right now that are continuing to have children.  Whether you have 2 and are pregnant with your third and can't afford them or have 6 and are pregnant with 7-14 and can't afford them what is the difference.  Now I have heard that they are planning on taking her children away.  I can list you children right now that are worse off and they still live with their parents.<br>  <br>  Also most get a TV show and book deals out of this sort of occurance (Jon and Kate plus 8, the Duggar Family, the Six Pack, the Dilly Six, Kids by the Dozen, etc).  So is it just that no one likes her or that she is a single woman or what, I don't know.<br>  <br>  Really how can anyone think that these tiny miracles should have never happened or are a mistake.<br>  <br>  There are bigger things going on right now and I only hope that life returns to normal for her.  Sorry to go on and on but I get so fumed when I see the media and others harping on this.|`|e1ae2fbad2e2e19da95432269bb0ccd0aa	I think its insane that a women who can afford invitro can also be on government assistance.  That's my major issue with this story.  I am also confused about how she put name on the birth cert without having him sign any paternity paperwork.  Last time I checked, in CA if you aren't married the father had to sign a whole bunch of POP paperwork to be on the birth cert.<br>  <br>  I feel for all her kids.  I can understand not wanting your embryos destroyed but you also have to look out for the children you already have.  There are probably many people who could have used those fertilized eggs.<br>  <br>  EDIT: as of right now the hospital is threatening to not realise the babies to her because she does not have a stable living situation.  The house she lives in is up for foreclosure, $23000 in back mortages. Blows my mind<br>  <br>  EDIT: She hasnt agreed to make a porno, there was just an offer to her to do a prono for $1 million and if she would be a "contract girl" then they would include medical insurance for all her kids.|`|x0J8S5sWaa	To tell the truth, everytime I read something about her I just start seething with anger. She is incredable irresponsible. She already had six kids! SIX! And she couldn't even afford those children, and she had plastic surgery. Seriously, if you look up pictures you can tell she looks way different. And then she has 8 more! It doesn't matter that she wasn't expecting octuplets, she knew that was a risk and she took it when she couldn't even take her of the ones she already had. I feel bad for her parents. They probably thought they would finally get to settle down and retire, but NOOOO, they have to become parents again. I feel bad for the children. Their mother obviously has mental problems. And I feel bad for the tax payers who are supporting her irresponsibility becaues they have no choice. I hope the children are put up for adoption to safe, happy families and I hope she gets the treatment she so clearly needs.<br>  <br>  P.S. I also hope nobody donates a cent.|`|ITfBQzg6aa	i think she is a very blessed or crazy lady... she has 14 kids in total that's nuts... God Knows i want kids but take away 10 from what she got.. But if God wants to bless me with that manny kids they hey im all for it if its Gods Will.<br>  <br>  When i first heard about that lady i was super mad and jealous of how careless she was and how easy it was for her to have 8 kids when i cant even have one..|`|vigFmfLmaa	I think it was her choice to make, yet a very unwise one.  She better be glad all 8 have survived.  Otherwise she wouldn't be getting paid for all this media attention and she and her other 6 kids would be without a home when the bank forecloses on her mom's.  Unfortunately, they are going to be her little cash cows now.|`|G4qP2gATaa	I'm so tired of these questions.....<br>  <br>  I really don't care.
VY4LqfLpaa	it can all be different.  I've gotten parent's choice nipples before in a medium flow that were faster than a fast flow playtex nipple...<br>  <br>  We use the playtex drop ins (I got tired of bottles and bottles and bottles)...these are easier to clean and keep from piling up.  I found Variable nipples for the drop ins which work really good.  They keep with babies pace rather than baby keeping up with the pace of the bottle nipple...<br>  <br>  I just wish I could buy the caps and rings seperately for the drop ins bottles...oh well...
IngripgMaa	It really just depends on the promotion they are running at the time, and how you filled out the survey!|`|3fYRi1y4aa	They should also start sending you the checks that they send out for 5 or more dollars off.  I loved those!  The store that I went to would let me use more than one and I would get them for free by the time all the checks added up.  You can also go on ebay and some moms who dont use enfamil anymore will sell their checks.  So you are still paying a little bit for the checks but getting way more of a discount.|`|nKXTjqQWaa	You're cheating the system to get more? Why not just buy Parent's Choice, it's just as good for your baby but half the price. It's sold at Wal Mart.|`|2N6KEoVqaa	How did you sign up for them?|`|FXINmF6saa	Why don't you just apply for WIC it's easy and you don't have to lie just tell them you can't afford baby formula. It's really expensive I know but they give you like 9 cans a month for your baby and baby cereal and maybe stuff for you I think. Depending on how old your baby is. Good luck and it's better to be honest there's nothing wrong with needing a little help, baby's are expensive. Remember if they see you're cheating to try and get more free stuff they'll cut you off. Just trust me, get WIC and it won't cost you anything nor will you have to do anything more than apply. Good Luck!|`|p1sB578jaa	at least they are free|`|8DnIXwnyaa	it depends on the due date you give.|`|rAkWoweOaa	This isn't really relevant to your question, but if you live in a town that has a Brookshire's (I believe that is just in the Arklatex, Arkansas, Louisiana, Texas) Everytime you buy a can of enfamil, you get a cupon for buy one get one free.
H0fXySX9aa	pineapple worked the first time<br>  the second time sex and lots of it good luck hun|`|b3CwObBdaa	as far as i know, due means 40 weeks, not 38.  why are you in such a rush?  are you sick?  is the baby in danger?<br>  or are you just tired of being pregnant?<br>  I would rather wait until my body and the baby decide that it's time.|`|Fd4lITkvaa	Sex and evening primrose oil may have worked for me. I started taking EPO at 35wks orally and had sex at 37wks 5 days, my water broke at 37wks 6 days. It may have all been coincidence, my son measured 3wks ahead and looked over done at birth according to my midwife.|`|aLkCxq5aaa	Hi, <br>  I'm with you on the castor oil...I would try most things except that!<br>  All I can say is, since week 37 I have been walking for an hour every evening, squatting, rocking on my birth ball, nipple stimulation, orgasms and sex...and today is now my due date!  I wish I could say something worked for me, but so far nothing has.  If I havent gone into labour myself in the next 4 days my midwife is visiting me at home to do a membrane sweep.  I had this done with my 2nd on my due date and contractions started 16 hours later although they were irregular all day and finally gave birth a day later, 2 days after sweep. <br>   I have now given up concentrating on trying to help labour along and hopefully now I'm more relaxed things might start to happen!! Tonight would be good! We'll see...<br>  Anyway, good luck for your big day, hope all goes well, xx|`|yB5go5wbaa	I tried raspberry tea, spicy food, walking, sex, bouncing on my birth ball, pineapple... and my doctor stripped my membranes three times - and I was two weeks overdue!  Nothing worked; my little peanut was stubborn.  Good luck, but yours will come when s/he wants!|`|wFe7L1XJaa	Sex and walking worked for me i had my son on his due date|`|veO1RXrCaa	Im 37 weeks tomorrow and my O.B said that Im officially full term.  I can have this baby anytime now.  She even made mention of a possible sweep next week.  If I am already dilating.  I don't get why people get their panties in a twist bc you want the baby to come sooner then later.  He or she is done cooking.  They can come now.  Im tempted to eat a whole pineapple, walk ten miles, jump my husbands bones, do some squats while eating a spicy dinner.  People need to chill the hell out.  I was fine at 40 odd weeks with my son.  I was well prepared to wait and let nature take its course.  Now Im freaking uncomfortable,  I think labour is coming and I want to give it a helping hand.  Try nipple stimulation and even walking up and down the stairs.  I hope your and my little ones decide to come soon.|`|POGZZmoUaa	A normal pregnancy is 40 weeks.  Why not just wait and let nature take it's course?  Let your baby choose it's birth date.  For sure you baby will come when it's ready.|`|IjOEpqgOaa	Try having sex! -My friend was over due, her doc told her to try sex! && after she did-- couple hours later she was in labor!<br>  <br>  <br>  Congrats to you :)|`|FfxgHWGxaa	apparently a very hot curry and a bit of sex is the best way!!!!
HmkCFddAaa	Talk to social services they can tell you what all is involved and the cost and such, they can also tell you about foster care if that would be an option.. You can also google adoption agencies, just make sure you check out their credentials before you choose one. Don't think you asked anyone for their opinion of what they thought of you but some seem to want to give that instead of an answer to your question.|`|nESfk0bXaa	Gosh, you sound like a lovely person.<br>  <br>  Normally I'd recommend foster care, but I think those kids deserve ADULTS adopting them, not someone who is "jealous" over sperm, and someone who "doesn't want to go through childbirth".<br>  <br>  Get a puppy. Kids are not glue to bond your shaky union.<br>  <br>  I didn't know marriage of gays was legal in Florida...a parent who lives in truth is always better than one who pretends and expects their children to lie as well. She's not your "wife", she's your girlfriend.|`|S5Lsbh0taa	Either way it takes the sperm and an ova to create a baby... funny thing about that is you need a man and woman to create a baby. Some things can't be glossed over no matter how hard you try to ignore it.<br>  <br>  (And I have gay friends who don't live in that kind of denial...)|`|511e806a702f7f4b678843ad2696165faa	There are still many agencies domestic, and over seas who will not allow same sex partners to adopt.  <br>  <br>  This doesn't seem to be the problem.  Your general blase attitude towards pregnancy and adoption really is indicative of someone who is still growing up themselves, and is too immature to handle the rigors of parenthood.  <br>  <br>  "As long as you have the cash"?  Really?  Even though most of these places are FOR PROFIT, that doesn't mean they are truly in the business of selling babies.  Lets just say that if they don't like you, or you don't reach their standards, your money (no matter how much) isn't going to be good there.<br>  <br>  Grow up a bit, then perhaps you can figure out a way to do this that isn't so offensive for you.|`|QOU5pQaAaa	"I get really jealous at the thought of some whack man's sperm in my wife"<br>  "she doesnt want to go through childbirth"<br>  "I don't think it matters to an adoption agency as long as you have the cash right?<br>  <br>  <br>  You know what I really want right now?  One of those adoption agency stamps that say in big read letters, "DENIED!"|`|R7qaqlrXaa	Give me a break! please don't adopt! this same sex couple crap has got to go! HOW DO YOU THINK YOU GOT HERE???!!! A couple girls got together and rubbed? Give the newborns a break and give them a chance to be raised by a "real" couple. No wonder this world is getting screwed up--<br>  Man and a WOman=child<br>   Hey did you figure out your medical reasons on WHY you can't have a child?????|`|qTElBk0caa	I would suggest trying 'foster to adopt'. Children in these programs are in major need of loving homes. Good luck to you two.... :)<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh, and for the most part..... the typical agencies ARE selling the kids. Which is another reason I always suggest 'foster to adopt'.... which you can still adopt an infant this way.|`|oiJITSNZaa	Yes some agencies that are left with some morals do not accept same sex couples. And rightly so...why do you even want a child? Sure doesn't sound like you are head over heels with the idea!|`|P9S5wlLyaa	Yes, it does matter to adoption agencies. They aren't selling the kids. They're trying to find good homes for them. And you do get the occisional adoption agent who doesn't believe two women should raise a child.<br>  <br>  It'll cost you the legal fees, the money for the home study, and the birth mother's hospital expenses. In general, the cost of domestic infant adoption can cover an extended range from  $10,000.00 all the way to $40,000.00 .<br>  <br>  You should consider adopting an older child, as they are far less in demand than wee babies.<br>  <br>  Here are some adoption agencies in Florida. <a href="http://directory.adoption.com/domestic/Florida.html" rel="nofollow">http://directory.adoption.com/domestic/F...</a>|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	Lady,it's not just about money. It's about how much time, patience,love,understanding,realism you have. I am sensing you don't have any of that.<br>  <br>  Is has nothing to do with being gay,straight,lesbian-so do not pull that card out. It doesn't matter-people are not scared like you think-they just don't want to be bothered.<br>  <br>  You need to readjust yourself first.|`|4lHJEq5Haa	"We considered going to a sperm bank, but I get really jealous at the thought of some whack man's sperm in my wife, and she is really tiny, so she doesnt want to go through childbirth, which is fine with me...<br>  <br>  I don't think it matters to an adoption agency as long as you have the cash right?"<br>  <br>  yeah... it really doesn't sound like you have your priorities in the right place here. sorry. Adoption shouldn't be about feeling jealous of a sperm donor, and not wanting to be pregnant because your wife is tiny, OR about handing over enough cash to buy a kid. It's about placing a child in need with a loving couple, not a mail order.<br>  <br>  Look into foster programs if you're serious about having children. And maybe wait for your maternal instincts to mature a bit. You are there to enrich the child's life, not the other way around.
BTuFtui3aa	There's no way for strangers to predict how either of your moms will react to your pregnancy-- that really depends on the personalities involved.<br>  <br>  Your adoptive mom can't give you back. Caring for your adopted child is not optional. Once a child is officially adopted, the child has the same legal status in the family as a biological child. If your adoptive mom kicks you out, she is guilty of child abandonment, and relinquishing custody of you would be no different in legal terms than giving up her rights to a biological child. The fact you are adopted doesn't make a difference in your current standing in the family under law, even if your adoptive mom reacts badly.<br>  <br>  It's somewhat possible your biological mom won't want contact with you-- it's unlikely, but the chance exists-- but that would be the case even if you weren't pregnant. You don't know who she is yet, so you can't be sure what would happen even if the situation were different. Given she most likely went through a crisis pregnancy herself, I honestly think she's more likely to be sympathetic than judge.<br>  <br>  Without knowing your families (adoptive and biological,) we can't really say how they'll react to your pregnancy. I think your best course of action is to talk to your adoptive parents calmly and rationally as soon as possible, so you don't have it weighing on your mind, and so you can get prenatal medical care, which is vitally important for you and your baby. Having at least a basic plan for how to care for your child and continue your education will probably help, but you have plenty of time to prepare, so don't stress about that yet.<br>  <br>  I hope both of your families will be loving, understanding, and supportive. If not, you can most likely be legally emancipated given your pregnancy, so you don't have to let them bully you even if they take it badly. You're a mother now, and you have the strength to get through this.|`|3e354ee85999a7bc21252e59e538dc35aa	Instead of worrying about it, you need to talk with your real mom (amom) and tell her what is going on. She can't give you back, but she needs to know and the sooner th better.|`|qayCggxMaa	Deal with one issue at a time.  There's no "giving you back", and I doubt your adoptive mom would even if she could.  Tell her about the pregnancy and deal with that issue first.  Finding your real parents may take time and will be a sensitive issue, but it can wait for now.|`|VOmE0UFsaa	Honesty is always the best policy hun*~ talk to your adopted mother*~ you never know if she is going to be supportive or not unless u  talk to her*~ u may be surprised*~ i understand ur probably scared but shes going to have to know sooner or later*~ and u need to tell her so u can start caring for your unborn child properly*~! A mother loves their child no matter what*~ just try talking to her~! Best of luck to u hun*~!|`|YR9l82vmaa	well, first of all your adoptive mother can't  give you away. and you should tell your adoptive parents soon, so they can get you help. after you're settled you can start looking for your birth mother.|`|8Qxb7OZOaa	First you need to decide whether or not your going to carry the fetus to term.  Go to planned parenthood....its free and they will also have a counselor there talk to you.
uqZsiMsdaa	They should fairly easily be able to determine the sex of the baby as long as he or she is cooperative and will spread its legs!|`|0upnZ6hSaa	Yup!!  I found out at 19 weeks.  My friend went for her 12 week sono and found out she was having a boy.  DRINK LOTS OF COLD OJ beforehand to get the baby moving.  I did that and the dr had a hard time measuring the little bugger....but he moved around enough for me to find out it was a boy.  AND--because he was so wiggly--I got to see him again on sono 2 weeks later so they could try to re-measure him.  (i didn't drink OJ that time!)|`|8zODA3dIaa	i didnt get to find out with either of mine till they were born...they both had their legs cliched together ..when i had ultrasound on my second one and the legs were clinched together i said its a girl lol...|`|oryGaz4eaa	It seemed like you can tell when you are 4 months along. I would be prepared to know. Exciting!|`|bxlYleZkaa	No problem. just so long as he/she is lying right!|`|t0mb150gaa	Yes they should be able to let you know the gender of your baby.

Good Luck!|`|uFrqC4Y2aa	Yes they might be able to tell you|`|KdqaGnlwaa	It depends on your doctor. My doctor wanted to wait until my 20 week appointment, and I had an appointment with her at 16 weeks.  You might be lucky, but if I were you, I would rather wait until everything is fully formed, because you might get the wrong results.|`|nFE6T6Hgaa	There's a possibility but they recommend at 20 weeks or so to find out. I found out with my son at 18 weeks. I would make sure you tell your doc that you want to find out and make sure you'll be able to get another one if you do. Good luck! and Congrats!|`|IjOEpqgOaa	I don't think so. YOU might be lucky.<br>  <br>  Earliest is 18-20weeks! <br>  Hopefully your baby has his/her legs open!

I found out when i was just a couple of days further than you,18 weeks..and they could see very clearly that i am having a boy. Good luck! :)|`|eV7rtxmuaa	Yes definately!|`|MUEsS8tYaa	Possibly. They usually find out around 20 weeks, thats when I found out what my baby was. But some babies like to hide. lol|`|drDpM6opaa	i also have my 20 week scan on the 2nd but i will be 20 weeks and 3 days cant wait good luck|`|zI3Y7Pz5aa	I would think so, as long as the baby allows for the view!! they were able to tell me my baby was a boy at 13 wks!

JyWCPVfzaa	Sometimes sex can make a lady's cycle come sooner, so by what you're explaining, I could be almost sure you're not pregnant. If you really don't want to have a child right now, you should start using protection or take your birth control pills.|`|HpWCjBv6aa	Implantation bleeding is usually a couple of spots of light pink or brown and then nothing.  If you were having any sort of flow, then you are not pregnant.  It's possible that there's changes in your body, changes in your emotions that are affecting your period.  Also, if you were cramping, I don't think it was implantation.    Morning sickness generally doesn't affect anyone until around six weeks.    This is what could be happening.  A) you could be having phantom symptoms - which is really just a way of saying you're convincing yourself you're pregnant, and therefore symptoms are popping up left and right.  Or B) you could have decidual bleeding.  Decidual Bleeding  One of the most common causes of period-like bleeding during pregnancy is called decidual bleeding. Sometimes, during pregnancy, your bodys hormones can get out of whack, causing you to lose parts of the lining of your uterus. This is especially common in the early stages of pregnancy, before the lining has completely attached to the placenta. While it can be troublesome to think about shedding part if your uterine lining, decidual bleeding is generally not thought to be a health threat to you or your baby.    So I implore you to take a pregnancy test, all the same, just to ease your mind if nothing else.|`|V55Yt1Ppaa	Hi sweetie, Do not panic, As per me you are safe. it would be best for you take a test then only you can be sure about any situation. All the symptoms which you have mentioned does not prove that you are pregnante. I had the same situation with me in the same months but I does not have any pregnancy. So you also take easy and go for test.    take care :o))
