I currently weigh about 215 lbs, and I already have a diet that's making me lose roughly one lb a week. (This is after the occasional slip-up, a cookie one day, can of soda the next.)

I have a ten lb dumb bell, access to a set of stairs, and your basic household furniture. Spending wise, I can't afford to buy anything more to help. Does anyone have any tips? Any exercises they know of that would help me in performing situps and pushups, or routines that worked extremely well in building endurance and stamina?      Also, I've heard a lot about Hydroxicut and other weight loss supplements...any of them really working for you? Please, no insults or unhelpful comments regarding my decision to join the Army.

First the Stimulus and then the mortgage bailout plans, which have brought the market down some 900 points since being announced....the lowest since just after 9/11. To add some icing on the cake, Obama then announces his *future* plans to raise corporate taxes and the taxes on those making over 250K per year.      What exactly is Obama thinking? Why announce the plans to raise taxes now? Why not wait? Why raise taxes on those who actually create jobs when we are shelling out over a Trillion dollars to preserve or create jobs? Is he trying to crash the market? That does not make any sense.      What gives? What are his true intentions?      Please if you feel the need to respond that Bush did blah, blah, blah.......there are those who realize that our economy was sound just 6 short months ago and throughout the Bush Presidency. No need to respond.
20090222171643AATT8nF	Politics & Government;Law Enforcement & Police	I need some help with a Speeding ticket?	Okay, I was going 75mph in a 45mph zone. The reason behind this  is that I had just got done doing some work on my car (new air filter due to it feeling like it was under powered lately, which it was. tire rotating and new tires put on, fluid check, oil change, few other misc things) and I wanted to push it to see if it would feel better than it has lately.       So I figured I would use an on ramp to the interstate (interstate is 65mph, so it would be safe for accelerating hard), yet their were to many people on the road, so I scratched that off and went to get a bite to eat. When I got done, I decided to head home, to do this I went down towards the interstate, the road is 2 lanes each way, 45mph, nice and wide emergancy lane with it being a long straight away. I was already up to 45mph and was like, this is perfect, so I nailed the pedal, rpms jumped to 6k (redline is 7-8k) and she was doing good. I had been speeding for no more than a 1 minute when I was approaching the ramp, so I began slowing down. Thats when I saw the shiney metal car up in the emergancy lane ahead of me with the lights off. I was like ****, a cop, hes already got me, no point making it look like I am running, so I hit the emergancy lights to begin pulling over right when he hit his blue lights.      The cop asked why I was going 75 in a 45, he had a hard time believing me and gave me a ticket. I got a court date in a month from now. Should I plead guilty or innocent? I had no idea it had gotten to 75mph, I was busy watching the other gauges and the road.      It was a clear night, no one else on that road, so to me it seemed like the best place to test my car and how it was handling (its an altima, not a racing car or anything) so I know what to expect from it. Aside from guitly or not (would pleading guilty affect me doing a retrail?) what would you expect a judge to do to someone who was testing their car responsibly (as close as one can when accelerating hard) after having work done on it to make it safer to drive?

I only found out I even had this account about a month ago when my dad told me I had to pay taxes on the dividends and capital gains.       I'm 19, so I should theoretically have ownership of the account (age of majority is 18), however, my dad (the custodian of the account) just told me that I couldn't have the money.      His reasoning was that he paid for my first year of college out of his retirement fund, and is going to take the money from my UGMA to reimburse himself.      I can understand where he's coming from, however, if he was going to use the UGMA money for my education, why didn't he just pay directly out of the UGMA in the first place (he was the custodian at the time anyways).      So the problem is that I had to drop out of school because I couldn't afford it anymore. Since I got married, I'm no longer a dependent of my parents and they are not financially supporting me in any way. If my dad reimburses himself from the UGMA account, that leaves me with nothing to use to go back to school (my first year of college was $15,000 according to him and the account is only worth $8,000).      Am I wrong for feeling like my education money is being held hostage?
20090222190129AASvkVw	Politics & Government;Politics	When will poor and working-class conservatives realize they've been had?	You're just a tool of the oligarchy.      A single line of code in an operating system.      A cog in an immense machine.      The corporate oligarchy you defend doesn't care about you - not at all, not even a little bit.       When they've extracted all they can take from you, they'll throw you aside and move on to the next.      To them, you are disposable, replaceable, expendable. A cost on their income statement. A liability on their balance sheet. Nothing more.      You will never be inaugurated into the ole' boys network. You will never get a seat at the table. You will never be invited to a three-martini lunch at the country club. You will never join the upper echelons of the ruling elite - they reserve that for their own.      The "rugged individualism" and foolish optimism they've instilled in you is an illusion. They tell you if you work hard for them, for long hours and little pay, that you too can become one of the masters.      They are lying. They will pull the rug out from under you, right as you think yourself on the cusp of entering the ruling class. No, they won't allow it.      They'll cut your salary to "stay competitive," and then ship your job off to China anyways. They'll fire you so they don't have to give you severance pay. They'll declare bankruptcy to steal your pension.      You think yourself honorable and righteous for not demanding the income you've produced. You are a fool. You think the myth of the "free market" is a matter of morality and principle. You are a dupe.      The oligarchy doesn't care a lick about the ideology they tell you to care about. They have no morals. They have no principles. They will happily rob you blind as you're foolishly parroting their talking points.      You are a serf, they are the lords. You are a slave, they are the masters.       They've taken your health care, your schools, your drinking water (remember back when you didn't have to buy bottles?), your roads. They've bankrupted your country and stolen your future.      But now that they've taken everything there is to take, and they don't know what to do, for they have no use for it anyways. They were never taking because they wanted. They took because they wanted to take.       Their illusion has been exposed. Their fraud has been outed. Their system of compulsion is broken. Their failure is manifest. Their debt-slaves are defaulting. Their fiefdom is revolting.       It's all coming crashing down, and not even they can prevent it. The implosion is unavoidable. Time to wake up.

20090222183732AAAM4XD	Politics & Government;Other - Politics & Government	In lieu of recent headlines, should there be an animal "Bill of Rights"?	Would u support an animal Bill of Rights?      For those of you who didn’t know, today kicks off National Justice for Animals Week!      Started by the Animal Legal Defense Fund (ALDF), February 22-28 is a week dedicated to raising awareness of animal abuse and to share information on how communities can come together to create and enforce tougher laws to protect animals.      As part of this week, the ALDF would like to send a message to Congress that we, the people, support legislation that protects animals and provides them with basic legal rights.      Enter the Bill of Rights for Animals, which would entitle animals to the following:      The Right of animals to be free from exploitation, cruelty, neglect, and abuse.      The Right of laboratory animals not to be used in cruel or unnecessary experiments.      The Right of farm animals to an environment that satisfies their basic physical and psychological needs.      The Right of companion animals to a healthy diet, protective shelter, and adequate medical care.      The Right of wildlife to a natural habitat, ecologically sufficient to a normal existence and self-sustaining species population.      The Right of animals to have their interests represented in court and safeguarded by the law of the land.    These all seem to be fairly straightforward ideas. Unfortunately, from backyards to factory farming and labs, animals are still suffering and cases of abuse and neglect aren’t a scarcity.      That being said, it’s time to speak up for out voiceless friends and send a clear message to Congress that we want legal protection for animals. While it's not an actual bill, hopefully someday it will be. It’s also something that legislators will certainly have to consider the next time a piece of legislation to protect animals passes through their hands.

20090222182936AAqLEi8	Politics & Government;Immigration	Why Are Immigrants On Welfare?	Some people mistakenly think that immigrants are not eligible for welfare. Several years ago, Congress did attempt to render immigrants ineligible for most forms of welfare. However, subsequent backpedaling by Congress and the executive branch has undone most of those reforms. Furthermore, many immigrant families get welfare through the eligibility of their U.S. citizen children. (It is also important to realize that even when immigrants are ineligible for federal welfare programs, the burden of their support is simply shifted over to the state and local welfare agencies.)      Refugees, asylees, and all amnestied illegal aliens are exempt from the public charge requirement.3 Congress has decided that the American people will serve as the sponsors for these immigrants and pick up the tab for their support.      All other immigrants must pass a public charge test and have a U.S. sponsor or sponsors willing to pledge their income to support them. Before a potential immigrant receives an immigration visa, American consular officers are supposed to evaluate whether he or she is likely to become a public charge, and, if so, to deny the visa. The consular officer is supposed to take into account a variety of factors: the amount of support the sponsor can give, the resources and skills of the applicant, and any special conditions (such as age or infirmity) that might affect the applicant’s need for support. The Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 set the new legal standard for the evaluation: the sponsor of the applicant must have an annual income of at least 125 percent of the federally designated poverty level. There are several problems with this standard:       Read further at  http://www.fairus.org/site/PageServer?pa...

Charges started off as Burglary and Possession of stolen property.  The burglary was dropped.  Now they are determining whether or not to charge him with a felony or a misdemeanor.  The determining factor is the price of the GPS.  If $400 or more, it is a felony.  So my question is this... Legally, what price does the D.A. use?  The original price of the item when it first came out (in 2005) or today's price and if so, where do they get their information?  This GPS is a discontinued item by the way.  HELPPPPPP!

Bottom line: Taxpayers are now on the hook for a record $59.1 trillion in liabilities, a 2.3% increase from 2006. That amount is equal to $516,348 for every U.S. household. By comparison, U.S. households owe an average of $112,043 for mortgages, car loans, credit cards and all other debt combined.      Unfunded promises made for Medicare, Social Security and federal retirement programs account for 85% of taxpayer liabilities. State and local government retirement plans account for much of the rest.

Any concerned government official reading this (who wouldn't support this idea because it would jepardize their paycheck and position)please calm down. I am not gonna overthrow your corrupt and ragged "democracy". Now those who are here to help please keep reading. I feel that the time has come to over throw our government and their so called "democracy". They infringe many constitutional rights, and only see the millions that are getting from lower class tax payers. The founding fathers did not have this in mind when they created the United States of America. Unfortunately over the years money blinded government and turned it into a crocked and backwards leadership. The United States is currently the strongest and most able country in the entire world. In a decade or less Russia, and/or China will be. Our "democracy" fails to see the hundreds of real problems. They try to end the recession but in reality they are only making it worse. The current recession will NEVER be fixed(until the government is fixed) because unlike the past economic crises there are alot more problems, under the surface, related to the economy.In a century or less humanity will end because of the population crisis. Recently in Britain a thirteen year old boy became a father. Now i am only 13 myself but this made me furious that a thirteen year old is raising another human being. What will he do for money after his parents die cuz he obviously isn't going to college now. What I'm trying to say is todays society is preventing the economy from being repaired. Garbage, golbal warming, and population are all HUGE problems that we must address. Now i will be honest. I wanna overthrow the government and replace the current "democracy" with a more sucre, fair, and equal democracy that is truly a peoples government. However many people fear the government and the military. I wish that people would first realize that if something is not done quickly then we will be ******. I also wish people would realize that where there's a will theres a way. The military is not as powerful as you think and with enough technology they can be defeated. Just look at Korea and Vietnam. The government is the same way if the south was a little smarter in the civil war they could have won. Same with Hitler in his quest to conquer the world. The government and there military puppets are not as strong as you may think. Also we as citizens must address the problems of society but we are to afraid of the government so we sit back and watch the "democracy" do their worst to us the people. We are responsible for fixing our government and unfortunately our forefathers made the government to strong to destroy it from the inside so we must overthrow it from the outside. Please please reply if you agree with me. I could care less about what anyone against me has to say. And like i said earlier i am not going to overthrow your precious "democracy" so put your guns and handcuffs away and don't begin deploying your Marines to police the world because that is not our job either. So reply if you agree DON'T if you don't agree with me. Tell your friends and family to read this comment on anything else that could be improved or anything else that the government is denying us unfairly. Thanks :]

Think about this new system: None of the candidates are revealed to the public. No history, no appearance. Not even stances.       Instead you have lists of 10 policies guaranteed by the candidate and his assigned number. As usual, caucauses and primaries would be held for their party.      The candidates are then elected based on their list of policies.      The candidate would then have one month to show initiative to do something about 1 policy, or the next most popular candidate is put in office.      Find the fallacy of this system if their are any.      Follow up: Do you believe Obama would have been elected under this system?

Please read more before responding :   http://www.chinohills.org/index.asp?nid=...     http://www.saynotopowerlines.org/       There are laws that require that power lines are 350ft away from schools, but I guess this doesn't apply to residential homes.          The school bus stop is right under these power lines.  They can move the bus stop, but can they move my children's bedrooms??       Alternative routes have been offered and deemed acceptable.

I stumbled upon a little known kept secret after I was laid off WHICH SUCKED over a year ago.  I was collecting on unemployment benefits after which is now extended. NOT SO BAD right, I made just as much if not more with no taxes taken out.       My girlfriend applied for diability 3 times to get some more income for us, and she was finally approved for Soc Sec. benefits with the help of an attorney.        I still don't work (on the table, lol), we are both on subsistence, she gets partial housing paid for (Section 8) where I live as well as our daughter.       I simply claim that I am homeless, and the welfare office HAS TO provide for me.  I simple don't make enough money $0 zero dollars.       We both get a welfare check every month, food stamps, a Pennsylvania access card (like a credit card), we are eligible for several community services, WIC, free pharmaceutical and walk-in health care at a local clinic etc.       If I told you how much we both made each month you'd crap your pants.  This is no joke, check it out yourself, ask, find out...      It's not what hand your dealt, it's how you play your cards... 5 years, then we move to a different county and it starts all over again, that's how it works folks. I'm not to proud to stand in line at the soup kitchen everyday. WE GET BY very comfortably... thanks Uncle $am, it's about time we help ourselves to the American dream, lol. You tell me who's crazy? Who is the fool? Why pay for the cow when you can get the milk for free?  I NEVER took a hand-out before, but now I see things differently, no night shift, no driving, no car insurance, no gas prices, no bosses, overtime, etc

They did the same thing that Republicans say that our government shouldn't do.      They infringed on a society. They got into affairs they had no business in. They borrowed money from the Chinese and printed even more to pay for this war, killing the U.S. dollar's value. That money is going to rebuild everything in Iraq that this war destroyed. The United States is spending $13 billion a month in Iraq, which by the way, is contributing to our record budget deficit.      You're taking tax-payers money, and giving to Iraq. Oh, now I get it. Socialism in America is bad. Socialism in Iraq? Necessary. Why? Because George W. Bush. and Dick Cheney said so.      Okay pro-Iraq war people, this is the point where you turn around what I just said so you can justify all the money being spent in Iraq.

20090222213845AAD8oFB	Politics & Government;Elections	Are you frustrated that almost 8 years after the fact we are finally beginning to focus on Afghanistan?	To me it is extremely frustrating that now we are beginning to truly focus on Afghanistan. After 8 years of what can barely be called a presence in Afghanistan we are finally beginning to concentrate on the region. It's extremely frustrating for me because I had a few close friends who were stationed in Afghanistan & when they came back they had said they felt forgotten and felt as if they were there for political reasons. Anyway... now that it seems like the concentration seems to be turning back towards Afghanistan and the war we were supposed to be fighting I am once again contemplating joining the service because as long as I end up there I would feel like I am fighting for the right reasons.

20090222214510AAVPBle	Politics & Government;Politics	Why are reforms to capitalism considered "socialist"....?	Reforming capitalism is making capitalism a more viable system so that the free market doesn't destroy itself. Allowing unregulated capitalism would eventually lead to monopolies.      Reforming capitalism is allowing capitalism to continue. As Obama is taking action to the economic crisis, he clearly does not want capitalism to fail. If he wanted it to fail, he would have let it destroy itself. Thus, he is not socialist.      Social democracies in many European countries, although better than the US, are still capitalist. These economic systems allow price to be determined by supply and demand factors. Social programs like health care are not socialist.

In fin dei conti, verrà sfruttato il governo di destra per poter risolvere col pugno duro il problema dell'immigrazione, considerando che ormai è questo che la maggior parte del popolo desidera. Con ciò, potrebbe, in un futuro prossimo, avere la maggioranza lega  nord....e risolvere così i problemi della nazione. Sarebbe bello, ma questo stato penoso sbaglierà tutto ciò che c'è da sbagliare e, come accade adesso, cè il rischio che un'altro topo vecchio sminunzito di sinistra venga ancora a far da padrone.

Questionam os jornais na manh? de hoje = que o público aguardado pela igreja romana  e parte da imprensa. No compromisso papal no Brasil - foi muito abaixo do que se esperava. Exemplos: Esperavam 70 mil jovens no pacaembú e o público foi de 40 mil. Em Aparecida aguardavam 1 milh?o, comparecendo um público de 150 mil. Em S?o Paulo na sexta-feira, aguardavam 1 milh?o e contaram com 600 mil. "Em contraste, a policia estimou que: Uma parada gay em Sp reuniu 3 milh?es. Um show grátis dos Rolling Stones no RJ, 1,5 milh]oes de espectadores. Igrejas evangélicas 1 milh?o." Os evangélicos tem reunido verdadeiros massas humanas em seus eventos. A exemplo o grupo de louvor: Diante do Trono, que tem em seus eventos reunido acima de 1 milh?o de pessoas, e no entanto a imprensa brasileira faz "vista grossa" e nem é preciso um contigente das for?as armadas, militar e civil para protege-los.

20090222212531AAxbHQ7	Politics & Government;Politics	Why is it that every recession for the past 60 years happened when Democrats in controlled Congress?	I would like an honest thoughtful answer to this question, I have researched the connection with Democrat control of Congress and recessions and I believe there is an obvious connection.  Please answer with more than the typical "Democrats clean up after Republicans" because it simply doesn't wash and the history doesn't prove it.  How about some thoughtful answers for a change?      Here's the data I used in researching the question:         Almost without exception every recession in the last 60 years happened when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress.  In the instances when the Democrats controlled a single House of Congress it ended a growth in the economy, which continued after they were removed from power.      Date of Recession    Control of House/Senate   1957-1958                               Dem/Dem   1960-1961                               Dem/Dem   1973-1975                               Dem/Dem   1980-1982                               Dem/Dem*   *In 1981 the Republicans take control of the Senate and the recession comes to an end.   1990-1991                               Dem/Dem   2001-2003                               Dem/Rep*   *Prior to the Democrats winning the Senate in 2001 due to a Republican switching parties the economy had been in a steady growth since 1994 when the Republicans had won control of both Houses of Congress.  After the Republicans won back the Senate two years later the growth continued until the Democrats took back the House and Senate and took office in 2007.

20090222213846AAwrnZv	Politics & Government;Politics	What has happened to the US?	Let me start of by saying: i am proud of my country with all my heart. But something is seriously wrong with our country right now. Not just the economy, but generally the society.      I think it is debatable whether we're a more tolerant society right now, or we were in the past. In the past, blacks and gays were exploited. There was racism and a true freedom of expression.      But i believe that the governments in the past were largely responsible for the racism in the US, the people would just follow the government's leads. The people themselves were no hating, it was institutionalized by the evangelical and Church teachings that governments liked to implement. It was the government that banned the smoking of marijuana because the blacks and mexicans did it, but didnt ban alcohol because the whites drank it.      I believe that the political correctness these days is far worse than the racism in the past. We are not a truly free society anymore. We cannot smoke marijuana even though it is safer than alcohol. Everything is monitored. Everything opposing the politically correct has serious repercussions politically and socially. The Americans in the past used to be exciting, daring, fun people. They loitered with drugs and other ****, but they also worked hard to make our country the best in the world.      These days, we are nothing but conservative pigs, who are actually more intolerant than the people in the past. You can argue that against me, but i think we have become more intolerant. In the past, people could migrate to the US because they knew it was the land of the free. It was a choice they made to come to the US, because it was the best country in the world.      But now, we are trying to accommodate all these Chinese and Asian immigrants in our country, because we can't do anything ourselves. Plus, we are not a free country anymore. All the CEO's and top managers of huge firms are Asian, and we are nothing. We are intolerant douches who cant do anything themselves, who dream of the past but dont do anything to implement it; look for our govt to feed us everything.

The top 1% of tax payers pay 39.9% of all income taxes, while the top 25% pay 86.3% of income taxes.  Without the rich, the US government would not be able to function.  Even though they lose upwards of 50% of their incomes to the government, they also contribute the majority of donations to charities.  The poor may resent them for their success, but they did nothing to cause your condition.  Blame yourselves rather than those who are more successful than you are.

There is a vacant lot next to my house where my roosters sit at night.  We live in an area which is zoned residential/ag.  I had my chickens in cages, and the neighbors shot them.  So, the remaining ones are free range, they still shoot them. Today, we heard him shooting again, I went out the back door, my brother went into the front to smoke a cigarette.  I saw the guy in the bushes, I yelled to stop shooting my chickens, he replied not to let them loose, then he shot at them again.  My brother heared the pellet pass his ear, almost shooting him in the head.  He went down to the neighbors house, the guy came out of the bushes with the gun.  When my brother returned, he called the police, told them what happened and described the gun.  The officer went to investigate.  The guy showed him a different gun, and said he was not shooting.  His neightbors said it was someone with a .22 up the road.  What can we do?  I saw him fire, my brother saw the gun and almost got hit.  The police say there is nothing they can do.  Please help!!!  We live in Pahoa, Hawaii.  The road my brother was stadning on is frequented by children, it is around a public park.

Do we still see Obama as a good president, possible good president, or is he another Bush-like President?

The '''Sydney gang rapes''' were a series of gang rape attacks by a group of up to fourteen Lebanese Australian men against White people. The term ''white'' in this context typically refers to Australian people of West European ancestry whose first language is English. The crimes, described as racially motivated hate crimes by commentators such as Miranda Devine ("Ethnicity linked to brutal gang rapes")saw blanket media coverage, the passing of new laws, and over 240 years in jail time handed out to nine men.The attackers used SMS and mobile phones to orchestrate the attacks, utilizing this technology to phone ahead to other attackers to co-ordinate timely transport of rape gang members to the locations where women were being held. Authorities later intercepted these phone records, and a small sample of this material was released to the media, the rest being too offensive to publicise. The attackers texted such messages as "When you are feeling down ... bash a Christian or Catholic and

Gol lamenta incidente com Clodovil e diz que houve falha no sistema    Em nota divulgada nesta quinta-feira, a Gol lamenta o incidente envolvendo o deputado Clodovil Hernandes (PTC-SP), que foi retirado de um avi?o da empresa nesta quinta-feira quando tentava embarcar de Brasília para S?o Paulo.       A confus?o teria come?ado quando um comissário pediu para Clodovil trocar de lugar com outro passageiro --os dois queriam o mesmo lugar. Irritado, o parlamentar disse que n?o mudaria de lugar e que deveria ser respeitado já que era idoso e deputado federal.       Segundo a Gol, uma falha em seu sistema marcou de forma indevida o assento no v?o 1847, de Brasília para S?o Paulo (aeroporto de Cumbica).       Por conta da suposta agressividade como teria tratado o comissário, o parlamentar foi vaiado e xingado pelos passageiros do avi?o.       O comandante do v?o teria pedido que ele se retirasse da aeronave. A Polícia Federal chegou a ser acionada para retirá-lo do local. Assessores do deputado disseram que ele foi voluntariamente prestar esclarecimentos sobre o episódio para a Polícia Federal do Aeroporto Internacional de Brasília.       Depois de prestar esse esclarecimento, Clodovil embarcou à noite para S?o Paulo num avi?o da TAM.       No aeroporto, após o incidente, o parlamentar escondeu o rosto quando percebeu que havia fotógrafos e cinegrafistas no sagu?o.       A Folha Online apurou que Clodovil exigiu que a Gol colocasse um jatinho para ele ir de Brasília a S?o Paulo.       Na nota, a Gol informa que se colocou à inteira disposi??o do parlamentar, oferecendo outro assento no mesmo v?o e op??es de embarque em v?os posteriores.       Crítica       O presidente do Conselho de ética do Senado, Sibá Machado (PT-AC), condenou a atitude de Clodovil. Segundo ele, o deputado deveria compreender que a orienta??o do comissário de bordo é de praxe.
