20090129040236AAXHAM3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians, when does passion become idolatry?	Many Christians say that idolatry is not just a worship of another supernatural god, but can manifest in the form of obsessive interest (e.g. clothing, sports, etc) or celebrity "worshipping".   But passion is one of the key ingredients for success, happiness, and purpose for life. If being a true Christian means that Jesus and spreading his word has to be one's only passion, aren't all "true" Christians bound to become just missionaries and pastors?    The amount of work and effort successful people put into their area of study amounts to their achievements in life (I'm not just talking about money-related achievement), but churches constantly seem to reinforce the notion that Christ has to be one's main focus in life. It just brings me the image of a medieval/theocratic societies that I consider too be quite negative. So to what extent does the "worldly" pursuits become idolatry and sin in Christian/biblical context?

20090129040846AAvbyzQ	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why are people who are ignorant talk so much trash about illegal immigrants?	Why do people keep saying that illegal immigrants don't pay taxes? If theyre here working.. illegaly yes.. but still they're working right? So they have to pay taxes.. theres really no way to get around that.. its not like u can check off "no i dont want to pay taxes" any where.   They even pay taxes that go to social security benefits that they obviously dont get. they pay taxes on other stuff too. duhh.   They dont use all American's tax money.. what the hell? come on. Yea there are things out there that help illegal aliens.. but still most of them dont know about it and pay for medical stuff, cars, etc themselves.. including college.   The job thing.. ok well i understand that theres no jobs.. the economy is bad.. but still thats only been recently. Illegal immigrants were here before that and job shortages wasnt a problem. They do the crappy low paid, no benefits jobs that americans dont and wont do. americans are too spoiled and would rather resort to food stamps than making $6 an hour mowing grass in the middle of texas or cold weather.   And now that the economy is bad, people try to say that its because of illegal immigrants.. come on.. seriously?   I get it.. illegal is illegal. yes. But still im sure many of you break laws.. do drugs, speeding, DUI, etc... and those things actually hurt and kill others.. coming here illegally? not really.. yes. there's a lot of murderers and rapist..etc that are illegal..  but u round up a bunch of poeple no matter who they are and some of them are going to be bad people// duh.   another thing.. people say that the children that illegal immigrants bring here or are born here should pretty much  be punished? ok so what if a legal american parent does drugs and puts their kid in danger, or does drugs while pregnant? Should the child  be penalized for their parents' actions? that doesn't make sense.   And some say "well, if i rob a bank, its ok because I was just stealing for food." Come on.. how is that the same thing. Illegal immigrants aren't coming here to steal anything.. they are working and making a living and paying for stuff themselves..   yes.. illegal is illegal.. but does that stop americans from driving under the influence or smoking weed? no... it doesnt.    I understand the whole thing about making immigrants in general learn to speak english.. yes.. this is america and even though its full of different cultures, it's America.. not your own country.   I think its rude to display other countries' flags.. and for immigrants who are here legally or not to bad talk America..   And yes.. they shouldn't try to make America seem like a different country.. have u been to texas? it doesnt even feel like you're in america! wtf?   I think America should not be made out to be other countries..    But seriously people. Don't be ignorant and say that illegal immigrants dont pay any taxes.. and live off of American's taxes.. they live off their own taxes they pay too. They can file for taxes too, though a lot dont because they dont know about the tax ID #. so they dont even get more money back..  they arent living here for free.. they cant get social security benefits,, health benefits.. food stamps or anything like that from the government.   So do ur reseach before you go and say something that makes you look like an idiot.

20090129041046AAKlCrn	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do people feel they need religion to believe in god?	I am a deist, which means I believe in god 100%, however I don't need a 2000 year old fairy tale to do it. I don't believe the bible or any other book written by man and I don't believe in hell.       Now my christian friend once told me "why don't you just accept jesus as your savior, then we can go to the same place". I told him that we will go to the same place weather heaven exists or not.       But when I was a christian I hated church. My mom took me to at least 10 different ones as a kid and I hated them all equally. I always felt like I didn't need a man to tell me what to believe. And I know that nothing i do in this life affects the outcome of my next.

20090129041426AAIT9L0	Society & Culture;Etiquette	When will "Bad Words" become a non issue?	Think about it, you can turn on the TV nowadays and find violence, sex, drugs, killing, adultery, terrorist bombings, rapes, dick and fart jokes,  and probably worst of all, mind-numbingly stupid things like celebrity gossip on every channel.      So why are little words like s*** and f*** so taboo when all that other stuff is crammed down our throats the rest of the time? They are only words people, they can't hurt anyone! Unlike a lot of the previously mentioned items I might add.      Now I'm not saying that swear words or any of that other stuff I mentioned are good. I'm just saying that in today's society we have become immune to these things and need to stop being so uptight over words.      What ever happened to "sticks and stones will break my bones but words will never hurt me"? Seems like today the saying goes "words offend me so give me all your sex, drugs, and murders instead".      Am I the only one who thinks this is ****** up?

The other day I heard a commotion downstairs, and when I came down and saw my daughter standing over my son, holding his legs up, while pushing her foot into his groin. My son was in obvious pain.   I immediately told her to stop, which she did. My son was in pain, but was otherwise okay. Later I talked to my daughter and asked her why she did that. She said that he had made her angry, and that her friend (the same age) did it to her younger brother (he's 7) all the time. She also said she's seen her kick him many times. I asked her if her friend's mother knew what was going on, and she said that very often her friend did it in front of her mother, and that her mother had taught her to do this to boys when she is angry.   I told her to never do that again, and that what her friend was doing was wrong.      What I don't understand is why her friend's mother would allow, and even encourage her to do that?      Does the mother have a right to raise her daughter in this way?

I broke down this morning and just begged my mom to let me stay. She saw the pain in my eyes. My body just can't take it anymore. She said that I looked like a junkie...Then my grandma started saying that I don't do anything and that I don't work. And that I don't even care about my physical appearance and don't look like a 16 year old. I swear, that was like the cherry on top today. That made me break down and cry even more.

I need sleep so badly at this point. It's not even funny.

20090129043904AA5Rtpb	Society & Culture;Languages	Does the Welsh language have a purpose?	Recently got into something of a debate via email with someone here who described non-Welsh-speaking Welsh people as only 'pseudo-Welsh'. So I'm curious - can someone tell me what actual function the Welsh language has in the modern world that we absolutely couldn't do without? You don't have to be Welsh to answer this, incidentally, I'd be interested whether anyone outside Wales has strong views on the question of whether the language should be mandated or not.

20090129043202AAUT9pX	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Why can't I forget about my ex?	The girl I liked since the day I started college (last year). Finally had the guts to talk to her, and everything turned out well. I was 18, she was 21. We were together for 4 months and everything was going good too. Around the Fall, the school didn't do much for her, so she decided to go back where her friends lived (...found out her ex lives with those friends as well).      We talked a few more times. I was concerned and as for her, she told me, "I didn't want to bring this up to you because I was afraid on your reaction, but my ex asked me back out again, and I couldn't say no". After hearing this, I felt shattered, as if my heart already had enough pain from her leaving.      I will admit, she was my first girlfriend, and things could had been better if she didn't leave, but no. 4 months being with her made me felt shattered for another 4 months.      After a whole year, I moved on, and I did things that I focused on doing for myself......until now. Now, for some reason, I can't stop thinking about my ex, but this time without me being upset (which I find weird). I keep thinking about her...but I'm not all that upset like a year ago. When I think of her, I catch myself just sitting in my quiet room, not even moving.      Most guys say that I should meet other girls...but I don't know. For a guy like me, I don't even pay attention to women much and I don't know why.         Why can't I forget about my ex??

20090129064649AAFyX3U	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Correlation between language and facial features?	The different sound structures of different languages can influence facial structures? Take for example, English and French, which are comprised of short "relaxed" sounds that require relaxed jaw muscles in order to pronounce properly, in contract to Chinese and Japanese, which are comprised of rigid and "strong" sounds that require tense jaw muscles to pronounce. Thus, speakers of Chinese and Japanese, would, over many generations, develop (or select for, in Darwinian terminology) strong jaws and jaw muscles, along with large, broad, and strong cheekbones (zygomatics) to support them. That is why I think that different language structures can definitely, over time, impact the facial features of their speakers. What do you think?

20090129064118AAMajQg	Society & Culture;Mythology & Folklore	Egyptian mythology project?	Cats and Goddess’ to Egyptians      ? The first domesticated Egyptian cats in Egypt were more than likely used for warding off the common asp and other snakes, and the typical chasers of rodents. Slowly though, the cat became more to the Egyptians than just a normal animal, the cat became a god.   ? Ancient Egyptians took their cats on hunting excursions instead of dogs, the most popular excursions being the marshes where cats may have been trained to retrieve fowl and fish. Statues of cats were placed outside the house to protect the inhabitants and to ward off evil spirits. Mafdet was the first Egyptian feline deity, sometimes depicted as a lynx, but the most famous cat goddesses in the world, first revered by the ancient Egyptians were Bastet (also known as Bast, Pasch, Ubasti) and the lion-headed Sekhmet.   ?  Bastet had the roles of fertility, protector of children and the protector of all cats. Bastet became so popular in fact that she became a household goddess. This goddess was called Bastet when in full cat form, and Bast when only having the head of a cat and the body of a beautiful woman.   ?  Bastet's counterpart was the goddess Sekhmet who represented the cat goddess' destructive force. Sekhmet is known as the goddess of war and pestilence.    ? Together, Bastet and Sekhmet represented the balance of the forces of nature in Egypt.   ?  In Bubastis, or Tell Basta, the cats lived a lavish life as the `embodiment' of Bastet in her temples. Egyptians also mummified their cats, filling their tombs with bowls of milk and rodents.       ? Sekhmet was an Egyptian war goddess, usually depicted with a lioness' head.   Sekhmet was credited with bringing death and destruction to the pharaoh's enemies and evildoers,                   especially through plague.   ? Conversely, she had the power to heal the righteous. Sekhmet's priests were regarded as magicians and healers. In later times, Sekhmet was seen as the aggressive side of the goddess Mut.      ? Bastet was a feline goddess of ancient Egypt who mothered the king and destroyed his enemies. As "the Eye of Ra who protects her father Ra," she was a manifestation of the solar eye. Bastet was regarded as both the daughter and the consort of Atum-Ra.    ? Bastet herself was generally shown as a lion-headed woman until the end of the second millennium B.C., when her cat and cat-headed forms became prominent. From the pyramid texts onward, Bastet has a double aspect of nurturing mother and terrifying avenger.    ? She also was one of the goddesses associated with the story of the "distant goddess," the daughter of Ra who quarrels with her father and retreats into the desert.    ? Isis- the wife and sister of Osiris, the mother of Horus. She was worshipped as the mother, and was one of the first goddess’. She is recognized in Greco-Roman mythology as Demeter and Hera.       http://www.swan.ac.uk/egypt/events/women...

I got a brilliant answer for my previous question about exorcisms not being performed in Judaism, and that they don't believe in Demonic possessions etc. Fair enough..       What happens if a nice Jewish family moves into a new house, then after a few days, strange things begin to happen - knocking sounds on walls, the piano plays by itself, strange sounds etc, poltergeist activity, you get the idea...       We have documentations of such phenomena among Christians (and other religions) in which a Minister or Priest is called to perform an exorcism or blessing in the house.      But since exorcisms are not performed in Judaism, how would a Jewish family deal with such phenomena? Or does that ever happen at all?       Thanks in advance.

I arrive 5 minutes before my appt. time and he's still not finished with working on someone's nails. He was just starting to file her nails. I was really disappointed because the whole reason why I made the appt. in the first place was so I can ensure that he would take care of me since I don't like how the other technicians do my nails. I had no choice but to go to someone else so that I wouldn't have to wait and miss my train. But just like I assumed, she did my sloppy as if she didn't care. :(      It annoyed me to the point that I am tempted to go to their competitors right across the street. What would you do?

Well Gen 2:24 states  ...''That is why a man will leave his father and his mother,and he must stick to his wife,and they must become one flesh''..........so taken literally,(like you have taken John 10:30 literally) does it make sense to believe that a husband and wife are now one individual, or are they two people joined in One purpose? Of course the latter is true, so couldn't it be said the same occurs for John 10:30, that in fact Jesus and His Father are two individuals joined in One purpose?  If you answer No, why is one scripture taken literally and the other isn't?

20090129063627AAFyedF	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Is it acceptable in Western Society?	I'm from Korea (a peninsula between Japan and China)   I'm often frustrated when I think of my girlfriend in her early twenties ( 10 years younger than me)   I usually spend my time, energy and everything with my girlfriend.   But she sets more value on her friends(whether they are men or women). Quite honestly, I don't look at any other girl but my girlfriend.   On the other hand, she often drinks alcohol in a bar with one of her male friends after midnight. And she normally talks to one of them on the phone after 1 am.   So I often complain to her about that, but she tells me not to worry about that, because she behaves carefully and only loves me.   Even if it's true, I don't like her being with them late at night.   So I wonder if she really loves me. How can she lets me down like that? At first, I thought it would be a sort of generation-gap.   And I also know that she used to want to play outside her home until late at night in her childhood, owing to her horrible father, an awful drunkard. This is why she relies on her friends more than her family.   But most of my friends agree with me. They don't understand my girlfriend's behaviour, even if she neither kisses her male friend nor has sex with him.   What about the Western society?   Do you normally understand her behaviour? Is it acceptable for a girl to stay with ONE of her male friends in a bar or any closed space after midnight or to talk to her male friends around 1 am?   Has my girlfriend become too westernised?   She says that she is suffocated by my excessive interference in her privacy. But I think that my complaint is justifiable at least in Oriental society.    What do you think about that? Who do you think is wrong in the conflict between my girlfriend and me.

Why didn't Jesus teach us to pray for his Kingdom to come if he was God in the flesh ?   Is he not also the Almighty God ?

20090129055115AAmfL3f	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	To those who think Christianity is religion.?	Often I read things like "Why does religion tell people they are going to hell?" and "Why does religion hurt so many people". Many people often forgetting that there are many peaceful religions out there. People like Buddhists, Pagans, and Hindus who don't hurt anybody but yet are also being attacked by the anti-religious for things they did not even do. Since when did Christianity become the only religion? Why do us peaceful religious believers have to suffer because a few people took their religion too far and killed a bunch of people. To those who think religion is bad and it kills people why do you include us in your statements. We do not force our religions on other people, we do not kill people for their beliefs. So next time you want to make a generalized statement deeming all religions intolerant, murders please remember that not all religions fit that description. So we have it. When did Christianity become the only religion?

20090129062327AAcpvIo	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is there any hope of getting help for my boyfriend?	Firstly I just want to thank everyone for your kind responses in my questions. I appreciated your help very much.      You confirmed what I already though, that if he is abusive, I should leave him.       But what I want to know is, do you think there is a chance he might stop being abusive if he agrees to go to therapy?       90% of the time he is great. We wet 8 months ago, I moved into his house 4 months ago, and he only started abusing me three weeks ago. As well as the "breaking glass" and "cahier" examples, the other night, we decided to watch a movie. He wanted to watch "The aviatior" and I wanted to watch "Armageddon". When I put on the dvd, he screamed at me because I had put on Armageddon, and told me if I didn't put The aviator on in 2 minutes, he'd lock me out the backyrad the whole night.       I cannot ignore it, these are incredibly bad things to do to anyone, and he has no right. So, if he got help, could he stop, or will he never stop?      If there is no chance, I'll leave him tomorrow, seriously. I am not putting up with this any longer. Thanks so much for clarifying what I already thought I should do, but am now 100% clear. It was way too embarrassing to talk to anyone in the flesh about it.
20090129064534AAaZQCa	Society & Culture;Etiquette	Whats a young guy to do?	Recently I ran into a friends younger brother who was complaining about how older women seem to hit on him alot for a guy of only 22yo. He basically looks 35 because of his drug abuse days when he was a raver (dance music fanatic) back at around 16. He drinks like a fish, and smokes pot like a chimney. Suffice to say he has neglected himself alot and looks older than even his 29yo brother, who himself appears almost 35 too!      Anyways he is always shunned from when he tries dating 19yo girls who are well within his age bracket and life experience, having only turned 22 a few weeks ago. When he tells them he is 22 they laugh out loud, like as if he is a dirty old man trying a pickup line. My heart goes out to him because often he goes home quite despondent and confused at womens reactions towards him. I sometimes go out with him and see how the constant suspicion about his age does wear down his confidence. At 1st I didnt think much of it, being 32 but looking almost mid 20s, I never get turned down by younger women, at least not yet based on age alone. So I thought he was exaggerating, but even showing them his drivers licence raised eyebrows and they just walk away, preferring to even talk to his almost 30yo brother! than make smalltalk with him. He is a great looking guy, but his youthful looks only held up until a couple of years ago when he did so much meth that he lost like 2 stone!      So my question goes out to the people.... whats a young guy to do? I mean clearly in this case its a matter of mistaken identity, or mistaken age identity. So instead he has to palm away seedy women who are old enough to be his mother in some cases grandmother! Is he destined to be shunned by his own age group? are young people so superficial that a few extra wrinkles or tired faces from years of substance abuse would change their minds completely about knowing someone their own age at all?!? What is the world coming to? Why isn't personality more important to young people these days? And how can I help my friend to being able to meet girls his own age and not have to contend with sleazy women who are twice his age thinking he is datable material for divorcee's or widowers.

20090129055825AAnhAa2	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	How can I maintain my sanity?	I recently decided to quite drinking for a while and set myself a goal to lose weight and get in shape.  For the last few months, I have been doing very well by inching towards my overall goal to accomplish this. My daily routine consists of me waking up at 4:30 to 5:30 every morning and going to the gym. I do weight training on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, and do my cardio on Mon, Wed, and, Fridays, I also have been keeping myself on a healthy diet to suit my goals and good eating habits.       The problem I have is my routine is starting to drive me crazy because I get really bored on my off days at work, and can’t find anything else to do while I’m at home after I finished my daily workout for the day. I can only watch T.V. for so long. Also, I think I’m starting to get too much sleep. I don’t nap during the day, but I usually go to bed no later than 10:00 pm every night. I can bear it during the week when I need to wake up the next day. But my problem is that since I designated Sunday as my resting day, I get extremely bored on Saturday nights and really don’t want to go to bed that early because, I have nothing to do on Sundays.      I particularly enjoy night life, but I can’t think of anything I can do that won’t jeopardize my goals to get into shape. I don’t want to go to a bar or club because I don’t want to drink. And I think it would be kind of stupid to go to a place like that when I have no desire to drink.   Anyways, I posted this question looking for some suggestions.   Serious answers only please.

20090129083722AAB3BqI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians - Do you do the will of God - really?	How serious do you take the following scripture?      Matthew 7:21-23    21Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of God; but he that does the will of my Father which is in heaven. 22Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works? 23And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity.      Notice:   1) They said Lord, Lord - They thought they were Christians   2) Jesus clearly states - Only those who do God's will enter God's Kingdom.   3)They were doing many good things in the name of Jesus.   4) Jesus states they are still in sin.      John 14:21   He who has My COMMANDMENTS and keeps them, it is he who loves Me. And he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest Myself to him.”      Do you keep and obey God's commandments?      I will bring only 1 of the 10 to your attention at this time. Do you keep and obey the 4th one? The Sabbath.      Not, do you keep it as YOU think it should be kept but do you keep it as GOD instructed?      John 15:10   If you keep My commandments, you will abide in My love, just as I have kept My Father’s commandments and abide in His love.      Jesus and the Father's Commandments are the same 10 Commandments.      Many have twisted God's Word to say we are no longer under God's 10 Commandments.

20090129051040AAsoCrc	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians: why must there be a deadline to be saved?	Namely, death? The way I understand it is this; heaven is a party. The door is open, and anyone can enter... the choice is theirs. They can choose to walk in, or they can choose to stay outside (hell). However, eventually they close the door (death) and the choice is no longer there.      My question, however, is why would anyone ever close that door? Don't they want people to come in to the party? I tmakes no sense that a loving god, who WANTS us to be with him, would at any moment say, 'no, you can't come in anymore'.       And, if it IS possible to come into heaven after death, and when you are in hell... then what have we atheists to worry about? As soon as we have proof that god exists, namely, that we will be in hell, then we will believe in god instantly. We can simply walk right through that door...

Who couldn't survive without fashion clothes?  Who couldn't survive without their cell phone? who would worry about what clothes to wear? Who would worry about certain food or just food to eat?  Who would worry about types of shoes or if you have shoes? who couldn't survive without internet or electricity to their house?  who wouldn't survive if they had to go hunt for their food or make their own fire to keep warm? who wouldn't survive if they didn't have running water or tv? Who wouldn't survive without text messaging, messengers, or email?  who wouldn't survive without their car or cars? who wouldn't survive without the sinful pleasures of the world?      A reading from Chapter 6 of Matthew: Dependence on God.  "Therefore I tell you, do not worry about your life, what you will eat [or drink], or about your body, what you will wear.  Is not life more than food and the body more than clothing?  Look at the birds in the sky; they do not sow or reap, they gather nothing into barns, yet your heavenly Father feeds them.  Are not you more important than they?  Can any of you by worrying add a single moment to your life-span?  Why are you anxious about clothes?  Learn from the way the wild flowers grow.  They do not work or spin.  But I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.  If God so clothes the grass of the field, which grows today and is thrown into the oven tomorrow, will he not much more provide for you, O you of little faith? So do not worry and say, 'What are we to eat?' or 'What are we to drink?' or 'What are we to wear?' All these things the pagans seek.  Your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom [of God] and his righteousness, and all these things will be given you besides.  Do not worry about tomorrow; tomorrow will take care of itself.  Sufficient for a day is its own evil."

20090129054553AAupaBt	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What do you think about the theory  the gods Jehovah  Zeus Allah Ext Are really Aliens ?	Have you ever seen the movie Star gate    Some people believe this is an accurate    Description of what has happened        MUCH OF THE Old Testament is devoted to describing the origins and early history of the Hebrew people. According to the Bible, the Hebrews descended from a clan which lived in the Sumerian city of Ur around 2000 to 1500 B.C. The clan was befriended and ruled by a personality named Jehovah. The Bible claims that Jehovah was God.    The ancient Hebrew eyewitnesses responsible for the above descriptions were not able to get a closer look at Jehovah. The Bible points out that no one was permitted to approach Jehovah’s mountaintop landing sites except Moses and a few select leaders. Jehovah had threatened to kill anyone else who tried. The early Bible therefore contains only descriptions of Jehovah as eyewitnesses saw him from a distance. It was not until much later that one of the Bible’s most famous prophets, Ezekiel, was able to get a closer look and describe Jehovah in greater detail.       Now it occurred in my thirtieth year, in the fourth month, as I was among the captives by the river of Chebar, that the heavens were opened, and I saw visions of God.    And I looked, and behold, a whirlwind came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire flashed, causing a brightness about it, and out of the midst of it gleamed something like a pale yellow metal.    Also out of the midst of it appeared four living creatures. And this was their appearance: they had the likeness of men.    And their feet were straight feet; and the sole of their feet was shaped like the sole of a calf s foot; and they sparkled like burnished brass.    And they had human hands under their four-sided wings. Their wings were joined together; and they did not turn when they went, they all went straightforward.   As for the appearance of their faces, they had the face of a man, and the face of a lion on the right side: and they had the face of an ox on the left side: they also had the face of an eagle.    In amongst the living creatures glowed something like coals of fire or lamps, which moved up and down between the creatures: and the fire was bright, and from out of the fire flashed lightning.    And the living creatures ran and returned by flashes of lightning.    Now as I looked upon the living creatures, I saw four wheels upon the ground, one by each of the living creatures, with their four faces.    The appearance of the wheels and their composition was like the color of shiny amber: and all four wheels had one likeness: and their appearance and their composition was like a wheel in the middle of a wheel.    And when the living creatures went, the wheels went with them: and when the living creatures were lifted up from the earth, the wheels were lifted up.    And the appearance of the sky upon the heads of the living creature was reflected as the color of the terrible crystal stretched over their heads above.    And when they went, I heard the noise of their wings, like the noise of great waters, as the voice of the Almighty, like the din of an army. When they stood still, they lowered their wings.    And there was a voice from the crystal covering that was over their heads when they stood and had let down their wings.    EZEKIEL 1:1-25       What do you think ?

20090129032429AAYzBrl	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If morality is independent of God, then?	Please try to answer all of these questions (particularly the first two).      1. If morality is independent of or outside of God (e.g. in the Form of Good), then is it eternal, and if so, does that mean God is not the ultimate First Cause?      2. If morality exists inside the mind of God and is therefore expressed in his commands, then does that mean God cannot command arbitrarily? If so, does that mean God is limited, and therefore not omnipotent? (Or how do you define omnipotent to avoid the contradiction?)      3. If God’s commands must relay either the Form of Good existing outside him (if you accept that view), or conform to his own nature (if you accept that view as an alternative), does that mean any commands alleged to be from God that reason reveals to be immoral are not from God?      4. If reason reveals that murdering innocent children and women is immoral, then does that mean that the Canaanite Genocide that the Bible records was a command from God is immoral and therefore not from God, showing that the author was flawed theologically?      5. If you counter to number 4 that the act of murdering innocent children and women is not immoral if God commands it, then is it immoral for me to kill myself, even though I hear God speaking to me and telling me to do so?      6. If you counter to 5 that I am crazy, on what basis do you make that assumption, and in what way is that assumption different from those that some unbelievers make about some biblical authors?

20090129053751AA6WCi3	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Does anyone else have experience of running groups for Christian singles and widows and the lonely in Church.?	I have never heard any kind of teaching for the single women in our church in all the time that I have been here, except that we tend to get ignored and all the married couples have families.      I have felt God calling me to start something up, but am unsure how to go about it.  I know you would say pray, well I have been doing so for the past 4 years!  And it won't go away, and this morning I had 3 positive responses and 1 slightly negative - but she is married with a large family.  I do not think it is a dating thing, I think it is that God says in the Bible that we should care for the poor, the lonely and the widow, and I feel that I am called.  (Why, God?????)      I would however like to hear from others who have groups like this and how they run things, activities etc.        Many thanks in advance and God bless those of you who are trying.

20090129070556AAq1Vx5	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Atheists: what are the top 3 flaws in atheism? ?	Atheism is not without flaws. I am not doubting my own atheism in any way, but I feel it is healthy to question everything, including your own convictions no matter how strong.       So - here's mine, in order of importance. I elaborate on each point below.      1) The origin of the Big Bang.    2) Why are this intelligent?    3) The Quantum World.       --------------      1) Easily the largest hole in atheism, in my opinion. I would say this is the only instance I can think of where science has no better answer than religion when it come to our earliest origins. Richard Dawkins has tried to rationalise it all by claiming that a God would need to be much more complex than a natural event, and therefore the latter is more likely. The truth is, no one knows because we can't draw any information at all from what happened before the Big Bang.      2) Our large brains demand high quantities of calories at all times. And although it only makes up 2% of our body mass, the brain demands 20% of all our bodies oxygen consumption. The thing is - nobody quite understands why evolutionary pressures lead us to being so intelligent, and we would still be at the top of the food chain if we were less intelligent. Obviously a fair amount of processing power is required if we are to communicate, but there still seems little reason why we are this intelligent.       3) Many seemingly impossible events occur in the Quantum world on a frequent basis. I'm sure that this is because we don't have a full grasp of it, but it still makes one question what we perceive to be reality, and if supernatural forces could be present.      -----------------      Just to re-iterate, my conviction in atheism is very firm, and I certainly do not consider myself agnostic. But it is arrogant to suggest that it all makes perfect sense, and that there are no loose ends.

20090129055401AAHjaM1	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Fellow Christians: a question about prayer.?	Dear Christian brother or sister: What percentage of your prayers focus on your personal well-being and what percentage are spent interceeding for and anguishing over the winning of the lost or the maturing of the body of believers?     I was reading from a commentary of Hebrews this morning it said:   "15 Looking with care to see that no man among you in his behaviour comes short of the grace of God.." Heb 12:15 a   "In our home, in our body, in our daily need, the temptations to ease and enjoyment, to sloth and standing still are ever around us and in us; let us take heed lest we fall short. Let us look carefully, and see if there are not others around us who are fainting and turning back, and let us count it our duty and privilege to care for them. Let us beseech grace of God to give us power in faith and love to be the; deliverer of our people and our brethren. If we feel powerless to speak to others or to influence them, let us lay ourselves; before God with the cry that He would use us to save some: He can fill us with His Spirit and His love."   —The Holiest of All      All this gave me cause to ask myself, Am I caring of others enough to consider their state as a Christian? What is the focus of my prayer? Do I pray for things, blessings, help, that is, do I pray more for my needs? or are my prayers concerned with the state of my brothers and sisters? and for the lost?   I ask you too: what is the focus of your prayers?

20090129063505AAxsL0w	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Not just reading the word, but letting it abide in us to overcome the evil one?	Getting to the Word of God and reading is probably one of the biggest struggles in the christian life.  It is one aspect of our christian life that is most attacked by satan because we know that it is by the word of God abiding in us that we can overcome the evil one.      1 John 2:14b shares, " ... I have written to you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one"      How important is it for the word to not just be " read" by us, but for the word to be given a way to " abide" in us.  So if we are in a situation where we cannot have the word in our hands, we have it in our hearts, stored up as a tool to overcome the evil one.      In what ways do you open up to the Lord and open up to the Word each day to have it abiding in you.  Have we all seen that its the abiding word that gives us the means to overcome the evil one?  How critical is it for us to even pay the price to memorize key verses and store it up in our hearts where we are prepared and equipped with the word to always do battle with the enemy and overcome him in the Name of the Lord?      Grace of our Lord Jesus be with us all here in the forum.   In Christ   sandy

I have written to you young men because you are strong and the word of God abides in you and you have overcome the evil one.

As a convert to Islam, your parents are obviously disbelievers and "Rejectors of Allah and his apostle". Therefore, they will be destined for the fires and the torment and an everlasting torment.     Now, seriously imagine your own parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, best friend, all of them being burnt by boiling liquid and suffering and in pain.     Can you really believe and accept that they deserve to go to hell, just because they don't believe the same as muslims?    Seriously, how can you accept that Allah would make somebody then just throw a good person into hell? Imagine your own mother in torment and suffering, being beaten and stretched and in pain.    Please share your thoughts. Thank you.

Hello I am asking a question to my brothers, and sisters, and I have taken into consideration that we all Love God, but are human and being so have defects. Mine is spelling....hahaha.       I Have been on this site for sometime now, but stopped coming becuase I started seeing the same ole answers from non~believers, as well as believers. I find that it saddens my spirit when non~believers answer questions with insult, or call the Bible a fairy tale. But it breaks my heart to see my beloved family of God answer some non~belivers questions with hate, or to say they are going to hell. I find it hard to have that crusader mentality, and say I am saved. The object of preaching the Bible is to further the kindom, not to trade insults with lost souls. Tit~4~Tat. It should not be so. I understand it is hard to contain oneself when our Father, and King is riddiculed. I battle this very feeling often. But I just think that Love concurs all. Even when someone is insulting you, cause in the end it is your heart, and how you feel that counts. To get in a dig, and say cruel things is not Christian. And if they must be in your walk, do them with class, and dignaty. You are not representing just any ole King. You are representing "THE KING OF ALL KINGS". Again I understand that it is hard to contain ones anger sometimes, but it is that very thing that makes you a servent of the most high. These are people who are lost, and many will stay that way by choice, but many have a chance if they see Christ in your walk, and talk. For many you are the only Jesus they will ever know. When you feel like lashing out, STOP, be Kind Rewind.......that thought. And think that answer through before you give it. You cannot take words back. Some people argue so they can learn more. Yes learn more, but for whatever the reason they chose to argue, or insult to see what Christianity is all about. And careful who you condem to hell. For one you are not the final judge, and two gays, murderers, glutins, the slotheful, all sinners have a chance to change, and all Christians will have a chance to backslide. I'm sorry if I offended anyone, but i just think the Love of Our Lord Jesus Christ can argue are, his point better then our anger at the lost.        Note: Never waver in what you believe, but use your God give tackt to show the world Jesus is love, and hopes that all will change before judgment day.       P.s. Have you hugged someone today, or told someone Jesus Loves you?     Let that hand you hold out be a palm of friendship, not a fist of hate.

I was caught off guard because he's never actually been the first to start a conversation, I didn't have much of a reply

20090129064516AAaCunI	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Seriously, what does this make me? ?	So, I believe in some kind of God, more like a creator of the universe. That's all he did, nothing else. I believe that everything in the bible is made up stories that are used to protect humanity. They are teaching written by men who want to let us know good from evil and are not to be taken literally. I believe in science, I believe that a galaxy crashes into another one, gases and planetary bodies spread and create a new sun, and then certain planets develop atmospheres and nutrients necessary for life.  I believe that then, that life evolves into multi-cellular organisms and then into some type of fish life. After that it changes in many ways and if life is lucky, it becomes intelligent. Thus we are born. So, is it possible to believe in a power that created the Universe as we know it but doesn't have anything to do with particulars of human life?
20090129071720AAzP7iD	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Other - Cultures & Groups	Why do a lot of people think black men own mulatto women?	I can't understand this. A lot of people think that all mulatto women date or marry black men, and that we never date or marry white men, and that all mulatto men date or marry white women    I am mulatto, I have a black father and white mother, and my fiance is white. I am 21. I have dated black and white men, but this is obviously by far my biggest relationship, and we are going to get married and have kids.     In fact, most mulatto women I know are married or dating white men. Some are dating or married to black men, but most white. And look at Halle Berry, she is with a hot white man.    So why is it that people think that most mulatto girls go with black men, and that most mulatto men go with white women?

20090128223324AA0i9nR	Society & Culture;Etiquette	How do I ask my roommate to give me and my boyfriend alone time?	(This is long and filled with details, skip to the bottom if you prefer)      My boyfriend and I planned on being able to have alone time this semester when my roommate went to visit her boyfriend at his school, where she went nearly every weekend last semester.  Unfortunately for us, he has since changed schools and is now in a different state.  Last semester, when my guy would come to visit from out-of-state, my roommate wouldn't leave unless she already had plans or something.  She was (and still is) always in the room.  She never took any of the hints that I wanted her to leave us alone, even if only for an hour, which included me literally crying while saying "I wish I was alone with you for just a little bit" on the last night of one of his visits.      We both want to have our boyfriends over for Valentines day.  Mine was also going to come over the weekend before, for our anniversary.  When I mentioned to her that my guy was going to stay over V-day, she said "Well I figured that you, he's coming here the weekend before, and you live close enough to go home."  I replied, "Yes, but there are other people in that house, and just like you, I want alone time with my boyfriend."  She said "I guess that's true," and the conversation was dropped.   I know that she wants to be alone with him, after being in different states and not seeing each other for almost a month.  It was the same situation my guy and I were in last semester, but did she leave?   Nope.      While I'm very tempted to stick around all weekend out of spite, I'd much rather make a deal with her.  My roommate doesn't seem to have any friends who dorm, but her sister lives in a different part of town.  I want to tell her that if she can give me and my guy one night alone next weekend, we'll find someplace else to go on Valentines Day.      I have no idea how to go about asking her to do this, or if I even should.  I mean, it sounds very fair to me, but I don't know if it could be perceived as mean or bitchy or whatever.  Also, for the future, other than striking up a bargain, is there a polite way to ask her to give us an hour or two of alone time, or a night?  Please help!

He considers our young men to be fools, and our fathers to have erred. You must either restrain him or allow us free action against him, since your religion is the same as ours, opposed to his.' But the apostle continued to preach the religion of Allah and to seek conversions, and the people hated him.

20090129081742AALEFcI	Society & Culture;Etiquette	What is the etiquette for sending my condolences to friend's family?	My dear friend of 11 years passed away in August 2008.       I just found out a week ago, after I looked at his myspace page. Everyone on there was saying how sorry they were that he's gone.       I hadn't talked to him since like early 2008; and we've been living in two different states for about 9 years now.       I'd like to send a card expressing my condolences to his family, but is it too late?      I looked at his obituary online and it says that memorials can be sent to the University that he use to attend. Should I call the specific dept. at that University before sending a card, or should I just send it? And, again, is it too late?      I feel TERRIBLE that I didn't find out earlier. But, I feel that I must send his family my sympathy and let them know I care; he was a good friend to me.       What is the etiquette in this situation?

People tend to avoid her as she has (possible dementia or similar) and goes over the same conversation again and again everytime you see her. I helped her out once because she was buying icecream for her granddaughters (whom i dont even think were visiting) and i carried them in for her, she told me there werent many decent people left in the world like me (bless her) and gave me 20p for my daughters (which i tried not to take). I am in two minds whether to pop over occasionally to see how she is and give her some company maybe take a box of biccies and a magazine or two with me, but i dont know whether a) she would want this or b) i would be wasting my time. I am in the house all day with my 10mo due to being a disabled SAHM so i know how depressing it can be on your own.      Any thoughts,

20090129074902AAZIjZK	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Christians..I have a question for you..?	Christians- How strong is your faith and are you willing to die for it?   If the government made a law against Christians, to arrest anyone preaching or proclaiming the Gospel of Jesus and that it is the only way to God. Would you be willing to stand your ground or would you be like Peter and deny the Christ if all hell breaks loose.. And what if the rapture didn't take place before this law was passed?      John 13:36 Simon Peter asked, “Lord, where are you going?”   And Jesus replied, “You can’t go with me now, but you will follow me later.” 37 “But why can’t I come now, Lord?” he asked. “I’m ready to die for you.” 38 Jesus answered, “Die for me? I tell you the truth, Peter—before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.      15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another of the disciples. That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, so he was allowed to enter the high priest’s courtyard with Jesus. 16 Peter had to stay outside the gate. Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate, and she let Peter in. 17 The woman asked Peter, “You’re not one of that man’s disciples, are you?”   “No,” he said, “I am not.”   18 Because it was cold, the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire. They stood around it, warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself.   The High Priest Questions Jesus   19 Inside, the high priest began asking Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them. 20 Jesus replied, “Everyone knows what I teach. I have preached regularly in the synagogues and the Temple, where the people[a] gather. I have not spoken in secret. 21 Why are you asking me this question? Ask those who heard me. They know what I said.”   22 Then one of the Temple guards standing nearby slapped Jesus across the face. “Is that the way to answer the high priest?” he demanded.   23 Jesus replied, “If I said anything wrong, you must prove it. But if I’m speaking the truth, why are you beating me?”   24 Then Annas bound Jesus and sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest.   25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself, they asked him again, “You’re not one of his disciples, are you?”   He denied it, saying, “No, I am not.”   But one of the household slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, “Didn’t I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?” 27 Again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed.      Here we see a man (Peter) who walk with Jesus, talked with Jesus, became his friend, experience his power, his miracles, worked with Jesus in his earthly ministry and yet when the flames got hot. He got out of the frying pan, by denying Jesus the Christ..      I wonder if it will be reported all over the news media, about this law being passed, that thousands of Roosters are sounding off and heard throughtout the lands, because of christians denying the Lord? And If you are unwilling to telling others now of your faith and love of the Lord, it is not written in scriture but I could imagine there will be many Roosters crowing for having denied the Lord...Are you absolutely sure that you would be arrested or even killed for your faith in Jesus? I may not know about your faith but Jesus knew Peter would deny him...

That's not a Heaven I'd want to go to. It would be just as bad as Hell. That would mean that God takes one of his creations, one of which would be sexual desire and sexual intercourse between 2 people, and tears it up and throws it away. I thought God didn't tear up and throw his creations away in Heaven. I find the thought of no sex in Heaven extremely disturbing and a fate that's just as bad as Hell. I would damn sure hope there's sex in Heaven. God would have to pretty damn cruel to give you a taste of something on Earth and then deprive you of it for all eternity.         Any thoughts?

20090129073131AASBCmz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Why do some Catholics say this about Mary, when it isn't in the bible?	Now this statement could be true, but they say:      "Through one woman's disobedience to God, sin and death came into the world. Likewise through one woman's obedience to God, came life and the hope of salvation. "      Weird thing is, is that Paul said that through one Man sin enter the world, and death by all passed to all men. Then he says later that:      Romans 5   18 "Therefore, as through one man’s offense judgment came to all men, resulting in condemnation, even so through one Man’s righteous act the free gift came to all men, resulting in justification of life"         So why do they say that Part about Mary if Paul never added that part to his teachings to the Romans?
20090129074913AAUyLYF	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	How come the Holy Spirit never told Peter or Paul to write about Mary?

Isn't that proof that we don't have to say Hail Mary's, and we don't have to say that she was sinless and we don't have to ask her for intercession.       Paul is in heaven, along with Apollos and Timothy, and they never said anything about Mary. So isn't that proof you can go to heaven without giving Mary any reverance?
20090129081420AATePcT	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	What amazes people about Mary, Jesus' Mom?	I don't understand, she didn't really do anything. As in, she's not recorded as raising the dead, healing the sick, casting out demons, as preaching to congregations, as going around preaching the Word to either Jew or Gentile, she wasnt martyred. Nothing, she didn't do any of those things. She sat and was taught by Peter on the Day of Pentecost, and she probably wasn't allowed to speak in the Church because of the rule of Paul.       So it doesn't make sense, she didn't do anything powerful like the Apostles. So what amazes people about Mary? Did not Peter and Paul raise the dead? So what do people like about Mary??

20090129072335AAV9uKz	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Is he bisexual, straight, or something in between?	This based on my last question about this guy I know who I've been debating about his sexuality with.       To recab his sitaution is: he's attracted to girls but they never seem interested in him. The rare ones that do most wouldn't want to date. He felt lonely for years, and since he'd get hit on by guys instead of girls, he decided to get close this very girlish emo guy who could pass as a chick if he were a transexual. (he's not trans)      To the point: He says he doesn't feel he's bisexual because he's not attracted to both genders, he's only attracted to femininity, and anyone who resembles (physically and mentally) a chick. He said "I feel like over the past year, I've been so desperate for some affection from the opposite sex, that I've considered getting that affection from the closet thing to the girls I crush on. And I've noticed that it's specifically white, feminine, emo type guys with girlish behavior is the closest thing to the girls I like."       He said if he was truly bisexual, he feels that would mean he'd be attracted to both the masculine and feminine gender. But he's only into femininity, and if girls chased after him the way they do other guys, he most likely wouldn't even be considering girly guys because he says he's not really all that into the male sex (genital wise), but more into that either are cute girls, or at least strongly resemble female beauty.       I thought that was very interesting. I admit I've seen some guys who look so feminine that they actually look cute like a girl, but I've never been desperate enough to want to be with one.      So is he then something between straight and bisexual? He sounds like he has a point, but what are your thoughts?

20090129081919AAtllSM	Society & Culture;Cultures & Groups;Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgendered	Why are many straight guys SO over the top in their disguist of male to male sex?	I mean I see/hear it allll  the time. "EWWWWWWWW, omfg...I'm goign to puke all over,..no wayyyyyyy, maybe if you paid me a MILLION...ew ew ew, dude that's just so gross, nasssssssssssty, yuckkkkkkkk," and they go on these , honestly, WAY way way over the top descriptions of their total disguist of male to male contact/sex.      I mean, it's JUST a human body. Girls have a body too.  Some guys are more hairy some are less hairy, some are clean, others arent. It all varies, and in all reality, men/women aren't THAT greatly different to have these straight men conjure up these over the top and ridiculous diguisted remarks.      I mean the way they talk about the nastiness of male/male contact, you'd think that they were being asked to make out with a skunk, horse, or a pig or something. Hell, in some cases, they'd rather do things with that, then another guy.         I laugh and I think to myself, are they just THAT insecure in themselves and sexuality that they'll go to any great lengths to mask it?      I mean when I see guys act that way, which is really immature, I think to myself...what are you trying to hide?      I mean for real, I TOTALLY understand that guy/guy contact is a turn off to alot of guys, and that's totally understandible and fine.  I mean heck, it can even gross some people out because it's just..not their thing...      but the whole "EWWWWWWWWWWWWW pukkkkkkkkkkkkke omfffffggggg my whole LIFE IS RUINED..." and that whole thing, is that really necessary?      It's JUST a guy. and then th e ones that want to be paid millions to do it. It's so stupid lol. Okay so you deserve millions for simply touching another male species. LOL.      Okay right, like they're THAT disguisting.         Straight guys need to get over their insecurity and over the topness about sexuality.      Heck, even girls aren't that bad about other girls. They'd even be like "oh she's hawt, but nahhh. im not into that." they at least respect/admit differences/similarities.      But men, no. Many straight men will rarely almost never acknowledge that another guy is "hawt" and say nice/great things about them. They always keep it to thtemselves, or get embarassed when they have to "admit" such things, and if you let alone mention any physical/sexual contact with them,      they go off the wall crazy. AAAAAAAAH!!! end of the world.            Straight men, what is wrong with you? lolol.      You make us laugh. (and the girls too)

20090129081240AAHuacE	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Foot Prints Does this Comfort any of you?	One night a man had a dream. He dreamed    he was walking along the beach with the LORD.         Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.   For each scene he noticed two sets of   footprints in the sand: one belonging   to him, and the other to the LORD.            When the last scene of his life flashed before him,   he looked back at the footprints in the sand.         He noticed that many times along the path of   his life there was only one set of footprints.            He also noticed that it happened at the very   lowest and saddest times in his life.         This really bothered him and he   questioned the LORD about it:         "LORD, you said that once I decided to follow   you, you'd walk with me all the way.   But I have noticed that during the most   troublesome times in my life,   there is only one set of footprints.   I don't understand why when   I needed you most you would leave me."            The LORD replied:         "My son, my precious child,   I love you and I would never leave you.   During your times of trial and suffering,   when you see only one set of footprints,   it was then that I carried you."            This carries me though life daily any one else?

I won't say I believe in it or don't, I'm pretty neutral about it but it does get a bit freaky at times.      A long time ago while I was on the bus traveling back to the city from the mountain I heard echos of children laughing. A lot of children laughing but the light in the bus was dim and everyone was asleep.      Once I woke up by this noise next to me. I saw a short weird shape figure next to me and I asked, "what are you doing?". It turned to me and I passed out.      I've also been having sleep paralyzing heaps but I'm aware that I get them through stress and no sleep however it's pretty freaky as I'm afraid that I can't move again!      Once I heard these foot steps around my bed and it stopped RIGHT beside me. I just shut my eyes and told myself not to look. Obviously my mind believed there was something there and I went to sleep.      So a few weeks ago I heard echo of this man speaking at the end of my bed. Then a few days ago I heard a man speaking and a child responding back. It was all echoish and suddenly I felt a big thump on the bed, and on my chest and my chest felt like something was constantly slapping me while I heard this "NaH NAH NAH NAH NAH NAH" in a child's voice. I remember myself saying "Remember the nah nah nah...turn around and sleep, everything will go away". I did and I forgot about it then a few days a go my sister told me she saw someone standing there in her room.      Anyway what could it be...I refuse to believe it's anything but illusion. I thought it would be cool to talk to it but then someone said never to talk to a demon! Only demon will touch/talk to you, whereas angels and others won't?      Okay freaky..

20090129081201AA7xxd4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Are there particular chants that are said whilst circling the Ka'bah?

It wasn't a job interview, but it was quite a formal meeting. I was greeted at the door by a receptionist, told to have a seat and wait for the guy I was supposed to be meeting. She brought me a cup of tea and left me alone to wait for a few minutes. Was I supposed to take my coat off? That's what I did.       Also, the seat I was sitting in was kinda straight on to the door, so it was like on my left. When the guy walked in the door, he introduced himself and shook my hand, I'm a girl so I wasn't sure wether I was supposed to get up or not, so I kinda, twizzled to face him and was sort of talking to him looking at him sideways. It was awful I felt like such a t***!! So, was I right in taking my coat off, and not standing up, or is that pretty bad?

Well, I've been thinking about it for a week, and I think I'm about to come out to my parents. As much as I want to go on living the lie, just so they think everything is normal with me, with my life, I can't stand the pain that tears me inside silently. It's hard, we all know that. And sooner or later, it'll be out there. They'll have to know. I don't want them to past on later in life not knowing me for myself. So, I have decided, that I am going to tell them tonight... It's hard, particularly telling my mom. She doesn't know much English, so I'll have to speak Hmong to her, and I know I'm going to end up stuttering along the lines of saying it But for my dad, he doesn't get home until later tonight, so Idk. I want to tell my mom first, but at the same time I want to tell them both at the same time. It's hard... :'(       Reef, if they blow up on me, will you still offer me what you did? In all honesty, I think I can handle it, but I can't really say so. But if you are willing, and if it doesn't go good, will you still do what you told me? *sigh* But the thing is, as much as I'd appreciate you being there, I don't want you to feel like I pushed you to do so.       Ugh, I am like 70% sure I am going to tell them tonight. I've thought long and hard, and yeah.

20090129082437AAohta4	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	Would it make sense to you if Atheists changed what they called themselves?	I know language is a sticky thing and it probably wouldn't happen, but if it COULD happen - would the following make sense to you?      To define ourselves by what we don't believe in, doesn't make sense.  We don't call people afairyists or aunicornists.  It seems simpler to define ourselves by the processes we do believe in - which are natural ones.  We would be "Naturalists."        Then, for people who don't believe in natural explanations for things, can be "Supernaturalists."  Then, it is up to THEM to find an alternative explanation to the natural explanation that biology, chemistry, etc. has laid out for them.      Your thoughts?

20090129083307AAblhBL	Society & Culture;Other - Society & Culture	Is it okay to be angered/upset by trashiness and people who fall below your standards?	I ask if it's okay because I'm against snobbery and classism myself, but I take pride in myself, what I drive, what I wear, school/work, and just being happy...trying to make the world a better place, and when I go out there in the world, I smile and really like it when I see other happy people with clean cars/clean clothes, look like they take care of themselves, etc....         and then when I see people litter, drive up cars that are just really banged up/not maintained, or generally look like people don't care about themm, and when you go by them you see 1000000 cigarette butts, weird odors...bad clothes...strange looks to their faces, like u know they're just...crazy or something....badly maintained neighborhoods, etc,...      basically whenever I experience poverty, hardship, people who don't care, violent people, and things which fall BELOW my personal expectations,      I get angry or upset, because I feel like it drags me down, or can drag me down, or I feel like that's what's making America look bad, and I try to avoid driving on those certain streets or going to those towns, because it just feels SO un-inspiring and what not.         I mean I strive for the best and I want to be proud of my country, but whenever I see people who don't care and add to the destruction of it,...i get uspet.      Like for example, I go out there put on a really nice upbeat, inspirational song, start singing, everyting's going well,...and then I notice that people are driving like maniacs, going like 20 miles over the speed limit, giving each other the finger, ...the cars...well..they look like they're from like the 70s or whatever...the nasty/rude trucks driving by, the bad roads...all the impatience/attitude...people smoking, not caring....         then I suddenly get upset/depressed, and find that the outside world breaks my bubble, and I feel like I get sucked into all of that and get dragged down and kind of become slightly impatient/miserable myself..because it makes an impression on a person.            SO that's why I ask, I know that I'm being idealistic, but what should I do...just give up and give into all the trash around me...or keep trying, or what? Because it upsets me.      I don't want to be driving down a highway and thinking happy thoughts and then have these scary looking people from a bad neighborhood drive by and look like they want to k9ll me.      I mean..that's unfortunately America today esp. by the big cities, and ...I hate it.

I have acquaintances who buy tickets to shows then don't bother going, they throw out perfectly good designer clothes just because they are tired of them, don't bother to pick up small change if it falls out of their pockets etc. I am on such a tight budget I scour the pavements for small change, recycle clothes, switch off lights wherever possible, feed my dog only on leftovers and basically fight to conserve every penny. I even wrap myself in a duvet every day as I have no carpets and can't afford to heat my home. I can't help but be offended by those with money who choose to throw it away. How do you feel?

20090129082542AAiwZdz	Society & Culture;Religion & Spirituality	If someone throw their life away to save somebody else', could that person go to the hell?	a man's family is sick. he needs a new heart. he and his love one is a match but it's illegal to harvest organs that donner can die without it unless the person is brain dead or something. so he decide to kill himself to save his love one's life and he did. (because the patient who needs a new heart is his family, he can direct the heart to himself if he wants.)      the reason he committed suicide because he wanted to save his love one's life but he also wanted to die because he was depressed and didn't want to live anymore. he had been thinking about suicide time to time but he considered it as a sin. so he never ever actually tried to commit a suicide until he decided to save his love one by killing himself. which he succeed.        in this case, could he go to the hell?
