LzSj90pbaa	When you buy something, you never want to buy it off someones recommendation.  The reason you do not do this, is because their needs might not be your needs.   The only thing that you have given us is that you want a touchscreen phone. Besides just the touchscreen, what else do you need?|`|qHMBkLx2aa	iphone.    You won't regret it. There are so many things that you can do with it. I've tried so many phones that at&t had to offer and I was never satisfied. I got the iphone and I'll never turn back now. Plus, it has the touch screen you want :)    Edit: If your dad doesn't let you get an iphone, I'd go with the eternity. I have a couple of friends with this phone and they seem to enjoy it. I hear the only problem with it is that the keyboard kinda sucks.|`|ORGIk7Vkaa	Plain and simple IPhone. 8gb for $199 and 16gb for $299 there's no other comparable option, plus far as touchscreen it blows all other ones out of the water.
LzSj90pbaa	CB is a gsm carrier, so the bold will work with it as it is a gsm phone. However, if you buy a bold in the US/Canada, it has not been software unlocked yet, meaning you wont be able to use it on CB.   You could buy a Turbo Sim or a Sim Rebel which tricks the phone into thinking you are using the assigned network. These run about $40 on ebay.   You could buy a overseas model that is unlocked and it would work.   Or you could just wait a few weeks/months until the att bold is unlocked and get it in the US.|`|EEhSNHkXaa	I'm told Cincinnati Bell will begin offering the Blackberry Bold within the next month or two.
cDYowiDNaa	I wouldn't get mixed up with anything verizon. I canceled my verizon phone service a month ago because they were constantly messing up my phone bills. They were always trying to sneak in new charges.They were adding new charges every month and sometimes they would send me 3-4 bills. I had to call them every month, waste my lunch-break, just to get them fix their mistakes. They would always apologize, but the same thing happened every month. Finally, I decided to cancel them and get service else where. Well, I paid my final bill. Some how I managed to over pay it and they sent me a check for the over paid balance. The funny thing is that the very same day that I got a check in the mail, I got a letter from an attorney that was representing verizon, and it said that I owed verizon $21.00 I couldn't believe it. I got a check and a threat from verizon on the same day. I have had service with them for years, and I always paid my bills when due.  If anyone has verizon, you should watch your bills closely|`|5sVrGqiZaa	If they are giving you something to sign a contract you are locked into that contract. you can cancel your service but you will need to return the phone and all when you do so. If you live in a 3g area it is nice to have the data plan!!|`|yIgd5vDAaa	Unfortunately, I don't think they do anymore. This is sadly becoming the norm, as Verizon just announced last week that they are no longer doing the "free" 30 day trial, and any charges you incur in the 30 day trial from here on you will have to pay for. Before, Verizon would foot the bill for your usage during the trial if you didn't keep it. You might want to try asking an AT&T representative, though, as they may still have some kind of trial period.
5sVrGqiZaa	Yes you can but the phone will not work until it is activated.  for example your friend has an Iphone and you have a Razr, you take your sim card out and put it in their iphone it will say phone not activated hook up to itunes to activate. Since at&t uses a completly different service for the iphone that is why it will not work. But you can stick an old sim card into it...by the way u need a needle to open the sim compartment on the top of the iphone|`|9CKrP9Keaa	All sim cards fit phones that accept sim cards. If the phone is unlocked then it will accept any providers sim card.|`|xsizQ5X1aa	Should be able to. If it's a sim card from the new att and has the 3g logo on it, than it should be that simple as to take it out, and stick it in the iphone.
lJAaBmlyaa	this won't fix what has happened in the past, but it's a cool voicemail system. Go to www.youmail.com it's free and will allow you to listen to your mail for free
Rw2owat5aa	Simply choose the five numbers you call most often and add them to your Fave 5. myFaves plans include:        Unlimited nationwide calling to any five numbers* on any network, even landlines   One-touch calling, text messaging?, and photo sharing?   No nationwide long-distance or roaming charges on any calls
bQ6zI02Xaa	Yes you can always upgrade to the iPhone.  The only thing is that if you are not eligible for upgrade, you pay more.  Ex: 8 gig iPhone upgrade eligible 197$-199$, not eligible 397$-399$  (walmart sells iPhones 3$ less, that's why I show the price gap)  So as you can see you can buy the iPhone early but it's double the price.  So unless you "have" to have it early it might pay to wait.  And you can use the extra money to by a good case or speakers.|`|5sVrGqiZaa	call at&t and see if they will allow you to do upgrade now, since it is only 12 days away they should let you.|`|nM1DMsNFaa	wait 9 days dude|`|cc3GVUZKaa	Well AT&T is really cool with anything. I think they will allow you to upgrade 12 days early. Besides they get the profits. BUT I suggest calling them ahead of time OR better yet go into the actual AT&T Store to talk to them Face to Face.
3zM7JptVaa	yes. it is strong enough. but i would get a case right away, b.c the back scratches like crazy. and it will drive you crazy.|`|XHharKJgaa	The screen is VERY durable and literally scratch-resistant. The back chrome plate scratches like crazy though, so I would still recommend buying a case. It's better to be safe than sorry. As far as cases go, I recommend the SwitchEasy Rebel Touch or Incase Slider. They range from $25-$35.
LlsCUAy7aa	i went to the sprint website and selected the same plan you have and it says unlimited texting is $20    Here's the link... hope it works:    http://nextelonline.nextel.com/NASApp/on...|`|LkulUylbaa	With that plan to get family unlimited messaging it is $30, slightly higher because you get it for more people.    Hope I helped!
k8MaZA6haa	Try activating your phone number on t-mobile.com or even call them so they can take you through a process to fix it|`|lJAaBmlyaa	do you have the sidekick plan? if not it'll always be there and you have to hit menu L to bypass
e318378ddbe6399092c196834588851faa	As long as you're in the service area.|`|k8MaZA6haa	Yes, Yes and Yes
LzSj90pbaa	It might be a good buy for someone else, but not you. Going off this, the only things you want are a notepad and email. You can do both of those on the iphone.  However, if you want to do something else, then the variables change. For example, if you text, then the iphone is not a good phone. You cannot send or receive MMS, you cannot forward texts, and you cannot send a text to multiple people.|`|LkulUylbaa	Well, the iPhone was perfect for me, but may not be perfect for you or anyone else. This is because I run outside a lot so I need my cellphone/iPod in one. I just love how simple it is to use and how good it looks while doing it. One thing to not though, I think that the touch screen typing is fantastic on it but now everybody thinks that. Some hate it, some love it. It's up to you.     Good Luck with your iPhone 3G purchase!    Hope I helped!
Awy82nOfaa	i dont think you can, but there is a trick     http://www.ventones.com    you can     1) make your own ringtones for free from music files, or youtube videos    or     2) follow these steps (trick) and you can have any of their millions of ringtones sent      -step 1-  after you sign up, make sure you login      -step 2-  go to the Ventones home page and click on the free Mosquito Ringtone  link. That one will also take you to the "free ringtone preview page" and it will show   the Send to Phone button. Don't click on the Send To Phone button though!    -step 3-  Next open the Ventones site in a new browser window but leave the first   one open as well. Search for the ringtone that you want   (from their free ringtone page ) and click on it.   That will take you to their "free ringtone preview page"   which will NOT have a send to phone button    -step 4-  now go back to the first Ventones window (the one with the mosquito ringtone)  and click on the send to phone button.    It will send you the ringtone you opened in the 2nd ventones window.   Sounds complex but it works every time for me|`|buvdUtEPaa	hey, i also have samsung blast.  I have to say that you can't do it. I find it bit strange too, because blast is messaging cell phone, but didn't allow custom text messaging ringtone.   other than that, i find blast a good phone.  Disappointing, but can't do it.
M9YNvbraaa	You can certainly buy him a phone with Sprint but you need to ensure   several things 1) that he really wants a p new phone 2) that you get him a phone he likes and will use-there are so many different phone out there that can do so many things sometimes you need to tailor the phone to the needs of the person 3) that you get te best pricing- you can get the best pricing if either of you are eligible for a discounted upgrade-only sprint can tell you that- and they will not give you the Information for you bf unless you can properly verify his account- usually some part of the ssn-generally the last 4 numbers or a password if he has one. i f you are not eligible for discounted pricing the cost is usually substantially more, sometimes 100.00 or more in the difference depending on the phone you want.|`|Qh2rc1DNaa	I would talk to him first...or maybe make a "coupon" for a phone.  A friend of mine bought a phone for her husband.  He hated it because he 1) didn't like the phone and 2) didn't need/want a new phone.  He ended up returning it.|`|ULX0NLUHaa	Sure, you can buy a phone for him. Make sure the ESN number is clear(call Sprint and ask). And then give it to him, he'll have to be the one to activate it because its his plan and not yours.
TudZYPN5aa	Black with the yellow stripe, unless you want to buy a case.    Cases are pretty expensive and hard to come by...
OaEQpd4yaa	The phone was free because you started a contract. You may buy another one but you will have to pay full price. The phone insurance doesnt cover stolen cellphones only damaged ones.  http://www.t-mobile.com/shop/Phones/  Suggested retail price is the full price.|`|9CKrP9Keaa	Call T-Mo|`|3yvuMkzTaa	When a phone was stolen from my account, I went to my carriers store, & turned off the old phone. That line wasn't eligible for an upgrade, so I had to pay full price. The salesman gave me a break on the price, & threw in some free accessories!!!|`|1QVAIKdyaa	If u had insurance on it then yes u can get it replaced but if u have no insurance on it then no u will half to buy a new one
LkulUylbaa	This would have to be because of the water you got in it. I have done that before with my Alias and it did that. I just bought a new one and for some reason they gave me a discounted price. I suggest getting a new one.    Hope I helped!
01GbQLZwaa	my phone used to do that all the time and as it came out the battery wasn't tight enough. I went through two phones with the same problem and i finally just took a little bit of cardboard and put in against the battery so it was pushing it harder onto the connectors. It was small enough i could put the battery case back on and with the cardboard it hasn't done it since.|`|LkulUylbaa	This is a common glitch with phones. I work at VZW and get this commonly. Take it in and ask. If you don't have a cell store near you, go to a BestBuy and call the Geek Squad. They are really good.    Hope I helped!|`|ChSZb4wtaa	Um sorry but i dont know so what i would sugest is to go to the local phone store (of your servace provider att, verizon ect) and tell them and they may give you a replace ment or fix it. =)
DjRjnzaLaa	DO NOT RESTORE IT! you will lose all your songs. too late i guess. check if you have a warranty on your ipod by going to apple.com and check if you have any so you can get ures fixed or replaced. Then get a cover for your ipod cuz the classic is very fragile. I put all my ipod songs on my computer using a program so if my ipod breaks then I can get a new one and still have the songs. (ihave 10000 songs btw not illegally downloaded) Hope i helped|`|bcb5bce7aeb5e5a747203a085360538baa	reset it press menu and the center buttons at the same time until the apple appears|`|APnnHXYgaa	Well I hate to say it but you may have to get a new ipod. If the warranty is current just return it and restore you ipod's memory from your computer. Hopefully you synced it! I hope this helps!

4jbFXoYfaa	no not my phone bill all it shows is the number of text you got or sent|`|d5ug5W5kaa	no because i have unlimited. if they did, i probably wouldn't be allowed to txt anymore haha.|`|82dqeCFgaa	no you have to ask for them|`|FNvv74UQaa	Texts are like phone calls, shows time, date and recipient|`|elPLFotOaa	nope and if it did i would be in juvy!  lol jk        -amber|`|bfxerFkeaa	i think you have the option to report it that way.  women love this function, but guys hate it|`|AA11146445	No they do not,but if they did then that would be such a violation of privacy and would be a major drag :) so your secret text messages are safe    by the way the phone companies only show how many   messages you sent and recieved|`|XuKj2TLwaa	NO! glad to|`|UlrvomV5aa	no.|`|rw1rvYIFaa	yes|`|ZIJvBQAMaa	No dumbie, or your parents would have already grounded you!|`|4rNMmoSpaa	It only shows how many text messages you have sent and have been sent to you.|`|Me8JEgzpaa	Nooo, they are completely free. That's why they are on your cell phone. Sorry sarcasm. It is hard to tell on the internet. TXT messages will appear, but they will not say who and what was on there.|`|Q6akazbZaa	no Y u hidding something, dont worry cause i will find out anyway!!!!!|`|AVShSjzpaa	no just how many, but if you have a legitament need for them you can find out by calling the phone company.  I've done this in the past to bust employees who were abusing their phones and racking up phone bills ( I wasn't a psycho but the ones who gave me $600-$1000 bills I looked into lol)|`|9lCulhIsaa	i think it depends|`|LlMS9NsSaa	Yeah, not on the cell phone bill that just shoes the amount but if you check it online it shows the  just the date and time.|`|sOTRIqLCaa	no it just shows the place liek country and how much . at least mine does|`|CUOgGhY7aa	i dont think so unless you have to pay to text one message|`|83a3dgKmaa	No it doesn't show up on my phone bill.|`|0TQKFdBpaa	yupp.|`|AA12032374	I have never seen a bill with that before, I suppose you could contact your service provider and ask if that can be done.

But if you have a plan with your parents they could find out without the bill. Try getting a prepaid phone if your so concerned.|`|7A8h5ralaa	it depends on your plan. if you have unlimited text, then apparently not. but if you don't it will show up on your phone bill. then again, it also depends on your service provider...|`|VfmT2OY5aa	haha nope! i have verizon but im pretty sure none of the cell phone plans have that.. thank goodness :]|`|0zHj2nZqaa	No they don't, with altell they show nothing, and with verizon they show how many but the account holder can go in and have your text messages requested if need be, say court ordered or something...|`|Vjem5OJhaa	No, just how many.|`|pn88K8UXaa	not on mine (verizon)|`|4vsYprP4aa	no it does not show up it will just tell you how many texts you sent and the charges.

But some phone companies like T-mobile for example do show the phones you dialed and received.|`|VOAyAhsSaa	I have a Cell Phone Plan. If I didn't have a plan, the text messages would show up as (for example): TXT 555-555-5555 9:04 AM, Feb 31, 2009. Though, if someone were to go into great detail, then yes, even if you didn't have a cell phone plan, it would show up the exact same way. Long distance texts cost more.. Anything that isn't part of your plan will show up in bold as extra. So if you don't want to get caught texting.. Get a plan. My parents are too lazy to check. :)
9I7Eynybaa	nope,its illeagle for them to even let them take a glance at ur texts,they cnt send them in the mail either,just the person and time.they can get in bigggg trouble|`|rQ9Fl0jlaa	no but they can find out at what time and to what number!|`|qBDL8iFxaa	nope
KbuOMIPxaa	jailbreaking your iPhone is basicly havcking/modding it by downloading a software connecting your iphone any running it it will hack/mod your iPhone so u can get like 3rd party apps or something and get loads of apps for free with this app it installs called installer :L its awesome but there have been cases where it has stopped working but it just means u can't download apps from it anymore its fairly simple u just gotta do your research quite alot    Your iPhone needs to be rebooted before u use the software to hack it I used it before I rebooted it and of wasn't so good  u may have to update the firmware or watever on your iPhone to1.1.4 or smething like that    there may not be a point now that the app store is out but you can get something else from installer called customize this let's you change the sliders, calculator, the desktop bit with all the apps, the icons, text beside the slider, tons more its cool    I suppose illegal because your like changing stuff on itandgettin free apps but i wouldnt worry|`|TpJbtJCfaa	No    Yes, you have a better chance of dying in a car accident than getting caught with that.

b2af104a189227ec51e22f6b307ab4eeaa	this attachment does not exist, and even if it did, it would not work well. XBOX live in-game communication has a very narrow bandwidth, and it would make music sound like crap.  Also, not everyone in your game will like the same music as you.  Why should they have to listen to it?  Also in many games, like Halo 3, constant broadcast of sound can cause game lag.|`|jnPEGDeaaa	There is not cord that would plug into your ipod to the controller.

Paypay charges 1.9% of money received. Ebay charges 5% for general things I think.    So to make a profit you have to consider these charges (these are off the top of my head and I may be wrong.)

2371cef50b34a91834d583994080ea0eaa	Microsoft has been focusing so much attention on the Zune that I think a handheld gaming system has been put on the back burner. Microsoft is also more computer oriented than either Sony or Ninentdo so I think it will be sometime until a gaming platform is realeased but like everything else Gates put on the table it will be amazing when it does come out.     I have never actually gotten into XBox, my sister sings it's praises, but I have always been a nintendo sort of girl. Recently purchased the Wii and PS3 and microsoft really needs to get the ball rolling to be compete with either of these systems. I would like to see how it all plays out.|`|fa4ebaff4471c0ffd47859120925908baa	Sure, Why not|`|DRf5F26Xaa	Future generations of the Zune will be based around wireless gaming...wait and see......Billy G told me so!!|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	No because it's just going to be another failure like the PSP when it comes to going against Nintendo.  Nintendo rules the handheld market, and it's going to be next to impossible to put a dent on Nintendo's handheld market.      MS should spend more time making the 360 better instead of diverging their resources on the Zune and the handheld.    Just so you know, there is a strong rumor that MS is already working on a handheld.

Your music is still stored in your itunes library, and will be downloaded to your ipod after you restore it.  It doesn't take very long.
DRf5F26Xaa	Well the PS3 has a lot of potential if the developers are able to max that out.  The current problems with the PS3 are all hardware related.  Sony originally intended to have "the cell" cover all of the processing needs for the PS3, including video processing.  Once they got to beta testing this they realized that they were going to need a real graphics processor and went to NVidia to get it.  Nvidia is using a renamed, relabled version of the 7800 (fyi..it's out of date) with the PS3.  The problem is causing major frame rate issues for the PS3.  It was hyped at 60fps, 1080P for everything.  Developers are finding out that is not the case.  I truly believe that they'll be able to get beyond the obstacles and tap the true potential of the PS3 but for the time being it's only good for a paperweight after you beat Resistance FoM.  I had a PS3, beat the game, and then returned the entire system after I figured out all of the hardware issues and the uncertainty from developers.  If you need a good example of development problems...look at Motorstorm.  It was officially delayed again today.  They can't get the thing to run above 30fps (barely 30 actually when multiple cars are on screen) and have downgraded it from 1080p to 720p native.  An out of date GPU and an unknown/untapped cell processor are giving developers a hard time.  Give it a few years and we might have a race on our hands.  Right now, all maintenance issues aside, the 360 is the hands down winner.|`|267d2a7127e536139e8cb68f7c89f6feaa	x-box 360 better games|`|7d6c925fbab78446ad6958d5d084eb3daa	ps3 is way better than xbox360|`|5ec1a0c4c193a1bb8f600b85fda762bbaa	The PS3 was rushed and has no good games except resistance. I was going to get a PS3, but once I played gears of war, I'm getting a 360. I wouldn't buy a PS3 until next year once all the bugs are gone and better games are released. And saying that the PS3 is overpriced is idiotic, the blu-ray it has it worth way more than $600. but I still prefer the 360 for now.|`|46ca0600f117d55aebcf794e9491f62eaa	brand name, then ps have more games|`|461d4e747cc2b9156c4fff70cf30186faa	I think that the showdown is going to be between the Xbox 360 and the Playstation 3. The Wii is simply out of its league. While its design is relatively unique, I feel that it the initial fun will wear off. The graphics aren't upgraded much from the Gamecube - it's not even HD! The thing I think that the Wii has in its favor is the Virtual Console idea. Nintendo owns the rights to most of the older, classic franchises (Mario Brothers, Donkey Kong, etc.), and they're not giving those to Sony or Microsoft. I have been saying for years that Nintendo should make a console that is backwards compatible all the way back to the NES or even to the Atari. But now that it's arrived, I think that it will not fare well against all of the hi-def gaming experience that the 360 and PS3 have to offer.    Between the PS3 and 360, I think the 360 will come out on top. Graphics-wise, I believe that both are capable of pretty similar graphics - most wouldn't be able to tell the difference if they didn't see them side-by-side. Microsoft has recently fought for its market share, extending their manufacturer's warranty to 1 year, continuing working on backwards-compatibility, and issuing upgrades that will allow the 360 to output a 1080p signal. Once Halo 3 is released and when (if ever) Microsoft releases an HDMI connector and upgradeable built-in HD-DVD player, I think the 360 will win.    The PS3 is so popular right now because of all the hype. In a few months, a PS3 will not be hard to find at all. Sony has backed themselves into a corner with this console. First of all, it is WAY overpriced. You can buy an Xbox 360 (although a stripped down verstion) for $300. The cheapest PS3 is $500. While it offers more features than the cheaper 360, the modest pricetag will be a HUGE winning point for the 360. Many people don't need the HD-DVD player, internet connectivity, wireless controllers, etc. The general public will be more inclined to purchase a less expensive console if it's comparable in graphics quality. Blu-Ray technology, while extremely useful in data storage, has recently been seemingly losing the format war. HD-DVD already has the running start with the DVD name. Add to that the fact that consumers will not have to buy a whole new DVD collection - all regular DVD's are compatible in HD-DVD players. In the end, I feel that HD-DVD will win out, which will be the ultimate blow to Sony and leaving Microsoft and it's Xbox 360 the victor of this generation.|`|AA10569237	PS3 ia just a overpriced paperweight. They don't have any good games out right now and so far 360's graphics have proven to be better.|`|8af62aac4b9377869569f38bcdbf453daa	look this is how i see it right now the 360 is winning the race practically every game they release is hot with titles like prey,dead rising,ghost recon,call of duty,perfect dark zero,lost planet,the only great PS3 have is Resistance fall of man one more year the PS3 will be ready|`|ac1365a624636ab08c89b38cdb516706aa	Xbox360 is better than ps3|`|AA10543564	It's better cuz it comes equipped with a built in blue ray drive, it's online functionality and services my not be the best but it's better than what ps2 offered and it's free out of the box, people often forget that, and best of all, it's region free, think of the possibilities, say from the UK US or even ASIAN countryz games made for those regions will play jus fine in your country no problem and in color.    Is it worth the price tag ofcourse yes. If MS decides to include the HDcd drive in the next batch of xbox 360s later this year, they still can't jack up the price cuz sony still would have a better offer than em.
DRf5F26Xaa	The best thing about plasma's are the refresh rate...but that's about it. Picture quality isn't noticeable to the average eye between plasma and LCD. Rather than spending thousands on a nice big plasma or LCD set I would wait for what's just around the corner.  It's called laser tv.  The laser lamps allow TV's an opportunity to provide "perfect color". The current UHP lamps used in most projection sets can only display half of the available spectrum of colors.  The truest color system available to TV owner today is still the old CRT set.  It's the only format that can show a truly black screen.  Plasma's and LCD's fail in comparison to a high definition CRT set when comparing color spectrums.  Some other benefits of the laser format are listed below.    -Half the cost of Plasma or LCD Displays (40 in   -Very thin display similar to plasma/lcd  -Energy efficient (use about 25% of the power used by LCD/PLS)  -Half the weight of current LCD/Plasma sets  -50,000 hour life    All of this info originates from Arasor/Novalux and is still in the development stages. Hopefully it comes to fruition...sounds like a great format!|`|ac7bb57758f4791cf3e994627d2438a2aa	PLASMA is certainly better than LCD. I cannot explain why but its the truth.
AA11662723	Depends.    Blue Ray discs play at 1080p resolution.  If your HDTV supports 1080p resolution, then the only cable that will transfer the information from the PS3 to the HDTV is an HDMI cable.  If your HDTV does not support full 1080p resolution, then a simple component cable (green, blue, red, yellow) will suffice for 720p or 1080i resolution.|`|DRf5F26Xaa	To comment on the above poster......the PS3 has big time problems with 1080i.  If you have an older HDTV that only does 480i/1080i then you are going to have some problems with the PS3.  If the TV cannot do 720 then it won't be able to display anything other than 480 from the PS3.  They keep saying they're going to fix this with a firmware update but it hasn't happened yet.  A PS3 is a waste of money unless you have a higher end Sony HDTV with full 1080p capability.|`|IL7ghayRaa	Need hdmi? no. The cables that come with the system or composite cables. The highest resolution they can out put is 480i, which is not even high def. If you want to watch a blu ray movie or play a ps3 game in high def you will need at the very least to purchase component cables. They are capable of showing 480p, 720p, and 1080i. With 720p and 1080i being considered High Def. Now if you tv is capable of display true high def (1080P) then you will need to buy either a vga cable or a Hdmi cable.    If your tv cannot display high def then just stick with the composite cables.  Now if your tv can only only display as high as 720p/1080i you can use a hdmi cable instead of component cables. The positivie of using hdmi is the signal is completly uncompressed and you will get a better picture.     I hope that helped a little and didn't confuse you. If you are considering getting a hdmi cable check out monoprice.com. All hdmi cables are equal dispite what the sales associates tell you.|`|784b5933d6032a4a0f7e2ddf1f751848aa	you do not need the hdmi cable to watch the blu-ray movies.  if you do not have one though, you are not seeing the quality that you have paid for.  the standard red/yellow/white cable has a resolution of 480i, which is standard definition, which is good if you have a standard def. tv.  a hdmi cabe has a resolution of 1080i, which looks amazing on hdtv's.  so it is up to you.  if you have a standard def tv, then use the red/yellow/white, if you have a hdtv, i would suggest that you gat the hdmi cable, but it is up to you if you want to see the quality that you pay for

TRLRsNwWaa	I agree!    The quality of broadcast programs varies enormously. It rarely shows up on normal TV though, as it's usually more than good enough quality for normal TV.    HDTV shows so much more detail than a normal TV though, that you can see all the imperfections in the broadcast picture. Oddly, this can mean that HDTV pictures sometimes look worse than when you see them on a normal (good quality) TV!|`|87025faa1ad26d83e76310469a07a407aa	If you are watching something that is not broadcast in HD, then the video quality will actually look better on an older TV than on a new HDTV.  This is because the signal has to be stretched to fit the more pixels a HDTV has.    Also there are two different types of HDTVs, 720p and 1080i.  They both look compareable but, if you have a 720p TV then a 720p signal will look better than a 1080i signal and vice versa.    Also, each TV has a different microchip inside that does different things to improve picture quality (remove streaking and blurring are examples).  This is why some manufacturers can charge more for their TVs, since they are technically more advanced.  However, for the most part you wont see a huge diffence between a cheap HDTV and an expensive one.|`|woSjw0BMaa	Not a lot of programmes broadcast in HD format.  Even if you have a Sky HD box not a lot of channels offer a HD version of that channel.
TRLRsNwWaa	I'm afraid it is.    Windex is very bad for LCDs. Some brands are more susceptible than others though.    I always use a clean cotton cloth or clean T-Shirt. I use a little soap - The sort that comes in a bar for washing your hands with.    Use a couple of clean, damp cotton cloths to "rinse" and a clean damp cotton one to dry. Do not let any water get inside though!    It's worked for me, but NEVER use any paper product like a tissue - I used one on a DVD and it scratched it like wire wool....    I hope the new TV isn't too bad?    Hopefully, it might improve a little better with some isopropanol on cotton?    Good luck!|`|7ca44a3727786e789f15a19554574c39aa	Probably.

NEVER use PAPER.|`|AA10531114	ur probably just paranoid, it wont damage your LCD. The liquid didnt go into the tv its only on the surface.
TRLRsNwWaa	You will need a 4 output TV aerial amplifier (I got mine from www.cpc.co.uk as they were cheap and good).    You should get one that says it is suitable for digital TV. The gain is good, but you want one with the lowest noise figure you can find (even if it means sacrificing some gain).    Then you should just be able to connect it with normal TV aerial wire and sockets.    I hope this helps?!|`|cbgAkhDGaa	Good answer from TK but suggest you ask for a coxial tv cable with a foil between the screen and the outer sheath.

j7rBM2yTaa	The early automatic exchanges were big machines that took up the entire floor of a building. These were designed to serve up to 10,000 customers (0000 to 9999). The exchanges were strategically placed around a city to cover an area of population and each exchange typically had a three digit code so that you could have almost 1,000 exchanges in each city. Each city would then have its own code bringing the full phone number up to 10 digits.    Many exchange buildings ended up with multiple machines inside them to cope with the demand. Modern digital exchanges machines are a fraction of the size and handle many more customers (20,000 to 50,0000 each). In the UK many city codes were extended to 4 digits  to cope with the ever increasing demand for more lines.
3xXIKcMOaa	Two more things need to be known.  Is it the big fat old PS2, or the skinny newer PS2?  Is the disk have the blue/black bottom, or is it the original clear?    Over time, the big PS2 become worn out, and won't be able to read blue/black disc, and then clear ones. (Once it can't read blue/black, you may as well just toss it. It's literally unfix able.)     However, if it's crashing, it most likely has nothing to do with your lens. :/  If you're feeling brave, you could try taking apart, and cleaning the fans with some windex and q-tips.    On a lighter note, it could also be just the power cord getting old. You can buy them for like, eight bucks online.    Good Luck~

Both brands make immaculate picture quality and only thing that differs in the 2 brands is technical and build quality only.  If you consider the way it's built, solidity, AF accuracy, reliability, ease of use and ergonomics, go Nikon, best in the mid range like D90. It makes good shots but has a lot of crap in technology like live view and video. Maybe, if you wait a year or 2 more it will have DVD player, I-POD, GPS and Cellphone included, maybe internet connection, who knows.  Canon cameras are good brand, good value for money. Black spot is the lens park that costs a bit more since all Canon lenses are motorized. Nikon's major prime lenses and high end zooms are motorized as well and cost the same lovely prices.  So, don't worry about the crop, look what fits you best. Have a look on and of production series as well, Canon D30, D5 or Nikon D80, D200. Concerning the crop, note that doubling the size of the sensor like APSC to Full Frame bring you just 42% more vertical resolution, so don't worry about the little more from Canon to Nikon APSC.    End of production cameras can be a good value for money.|`|pZGLhV2Waa	They are both basically the same but the D90 is a bit newer and has video. No you should not be worrying about buying a crop sensor DSLR. In order to get a full frame you would have to at least double your budget. While I see full frame cameras being considerably cheaper in the future that wont be until whichever camera you choose is long since obsolete. Just make sure you buy good quality lenses because these will last a lifetime.|`|FQuuztpQaa	What's the point? 10 or 12. 12 is better the 50d might be too much mps.

Audio type not supported means that the phone you sent the file to (which I assume you did) can not play that specific file type. Can you provide more details?|`|CkW0lc8gaa	1. Make phone A and B visible. If same type of phone, ensure that the phone names are unique.    2. Select content you want to transfer e.g. sound file or picture.    3. There will be options to transfer using email, SMS or Bluetooth.    4. Select Bluetooth and it will then ask to scan for available devices.    5. Once you've IDed the phone you want to connect to, select it.    6. On the receiving phone, you will be prompted whether you want to accept the content from the sending phone.    7. Accept.    8.

I am not sure what make of phones you have  .. that would help ... you can get what they call a  "dongle " this is a device that will add blue tooth to your computer ... if your phones will play mp3 or other audio formats you can either send music or tones to your phones that way or copy the tones that are already on there .. You can get them on eBay .. cheap ..  And some phones like Nokia offer free software to add tones and exchange files to and from your cell phone ..by means of either a cable or blue tooth .. ( tones may not be free but you could probably find some or edit Mp3 to create your own ..) so if I knew the make and model of your phone it would help ..|`|0kQVsVPvaa	That means that whatever you are trying to transfer is not supported on one of the phones.

CkW0lc8gaa	I presume you are looking at getting one for your mobile phone.    I have a 1GB Sandisk MicroSD transflash memory card. It came with a SD adapter. I used it with my Motorola V3X and now a V6 Maxx. Works just fine.    In theory, you can take the card of the phone and use the adapter to read it on your PC. However, in practice, the card is so small and I've found it generally hard to remove from my phone. I find it much easier to use the USB cable. Once connected to my PC, it is recognised as a disk drive. I can then copy and move data as required.    When I made the switch from the V3X to V6 Maxx, the applications installed on the card needed to be reinstalled. As for the sound files and music, it was ok. The new phone was able to read and recognise the files.    I understand that the V3X will only recognise up to 1GB. The V6 Maxx will recognise up to 2GB.

Sometimes they will do if for free.|`|CkW0lc8gaa	Most Nokia and Motorola have PC software that will allow you to synch your contact list in Outlook and do transfer from PC to phone or vice versa.    In the case of Nokia, it's called PC Suite. For Motorola, it's Motorola Phone Tools.    I maintain my contact data in Outlook and the transfer over to whatever phone I'm using. Depending on the phone model, not all the fields are available. However most phones have the following:    Name  Address  Phone Numbers i.e. mobile, home, office  Email

Please note that Motorola Phone Tools is not a free software. Download at your own risk|`|CkW0lc8gaa	There's a CD that comes with the phone called Motorola Phone Tools. It allows you to transfer music, ring tones, pictures etc.
CkW0lc8gaa	This phone could be locked.|`|0gwsGzB0aa	Most sims cards are programed to work in the country of origin.

CkW0lc8gaa	Make your own. Here's how.    http://moto.ninetoez.net/maketones.html    This works for the Motorola V600, V3X and V6 Maxx.    I'm a Star Trek fan and I have some sound effects that I use:    1. Priority one message from StarFleet coming in on secured channel  2. We are the Borg, lower your shields and surrender your ship. Resisistance is futile  3. Emergency Klaxon  4. A vessel has been detected in unimatrix 101. Alter course to intercept  5. Communicator chirp|`|AA10690673	First find out what audio extension file your phone reads, this would depend on its model and brand. Can it read mp3? midi? mid? wma? If it can, you can download free sound effects and some audio clips from some sites on the internet. Save these to your computer hard disk then copy it to your phone's audio folder via bluetooth, infrared or USB cable.   If the files you like to copy cannot be read by your phone you will have to find a suitable file converter. I would recommend that you reduce the file size before transferring it to your phone so that it fits within your phone's memory capacity.
PNf83uugaa	High-Speed Downlink Packet Access (HSDPA) (Sometimes known as High-Speed Downlink Protocol Access) is a 3G mobile telephony protocol in the HSPA family, which provides a roadmap for UMTS-based networks to increase their data transfer speeds and capacity. Current HSDPA deployments now support 1.8 Mbit/s, 3.6 Mbit/s, 7.2 Mbit/s and 14.4 Mbit/s in downlink.    Further speed grades are planned for the near future. The networks are then to be upgraded to HSPA Evolved, which provides speeds of 42Mbit downlink in its first release.    In addition to supporting high data speeds, HSDPA greatly increases the capacity of the network. Current HSDPA networks have the capacity to provide each customer with 30 gigabytes of data per month in addition to 1000 minutes of voice and 300 minutes of mobile TV.|`|CkW0lc8gaa	HSDPA = High-Speed Downlink Packet Access. It's available on some phones like the Motorola V6 Maxx. It's fast!
CkW0lc8gaa	Use Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). Under Media Studio, there's option for Video editing. Select the video you want to transfer and use the software to transfer over to your phone. It will convert into an acceptable format for the phone. Note that there's a file size limit. Having said that, I've heard that some people have watched an entire series of "Lost" on their phone. It was the V3X if I recall.    Enjoy :-)
CkW0lc8gaa	You can download the manual    http://www.motorola.com/consumer/v/index...    Goto the contact you to create voice dialing. Locate the Voice Dial field. You'll be prompted to record a sound. Follow instructions. Save and you are done.    To use voice dialling, press the Obey Moto key. Say the name and it will dial the number.    Enjoy :-)
CkW0lc8gaa	IMHO the PEBL is a beautiful phone. The phone feels pleasant to touch and hold. It has a nice soft feel. In the looks department, it looks pleasant.    In terms of features, it's basic. Good for making phone calls, SMSing and has GPRS data access. Memory is also limited so you can install a few Java midlet to increase functionality.    Bottomline: If you like the look and feel and just want to make phone calls, SMS and do some web browsing, this is the phone for you.|`|9334468ee62575fcb841386642db7df5aa	OMG, boo hooo you want a blue pelb, and your mommy won't let you get it. Your lucky you can even switch your phones! I have a cingular nokia, ok, and I don't have text mesagging or internet access!

CkW0lc8gaa	It's my preferred mode of communication in some instances such as:    1. confirmation of meeting venue, date and time  2. confirmation of specific details  3. communicating specific details e.g. address, phone number    The reason I prefer SMS over voice in such instances:    1. non-intrusive i.e. receipient can view SMS at their own leisure or even when they are in a meeting  2. delivers message in unambigious manner (of course depends on who u craft the message)  3. retains record for both sender and receipient    It is not appropriate for the following:    1. I need to explain to someone  2. deliver a lengthy message  3. convey emotions i.e. apology etc.  4. negotiate
CkW0lc8gaa	This is in the phones software. The only to get rid of it is to reflash the software with a generic version. However, this will wipe out all your customized settings and all data. GPRS settings will need to be entered in again.    If you still decide to go ahead with this, backup all your data before hand. I strongly recommend you read up on the flash version BEFORE doing anything. A good place to start is Howard Forums.    www.howardforums    Look under your phone manufacturer section.    REMEMBER: Reflashing your software could destroy your phone rendering it useless
CkW0lc8gaa	If you can be bothered, try this. It's loads of fun and free!    http://moto.ninetoez.net/maketones.html|`|MfmP1mU5aa	no i think xingtone.com costs you can try mytinyphone.com and click on "make ringtone"...its free by the way|`|mKR0PugVaa	Xingtone.com  I make all my own great ringtones from my mp3 files.

AA10100003	Yes.  Like the person above me said, it can depend on the make and model of the phone.  It also depends on the type of antenna; some have the short stubby antenna, some are extendable, others are integrated into the phone.  Same principal as a TV antenna; it doesn't work as well right next to the TV, lengthen it, and you'll get better reception.|`|CkW0lc8gaa	Short answer is yes. My wife and I have different phones but we are both on same telco plan. We see who's phone picks up a particular network first as we near the border.  It's become a little contest as I'm a hard core Motorola fan and she's Nokia. I'm proud to say that my Motorola seems better at this. Both handsets are stock models with no antennae enhancements of any sort :-)
CkW0lc8gaa	If you have pictures or music on your phone, try deleting some of them or better still, transfer them to your PC.    If you still experience problems, I recommend using Opera Mini. This is an excellent 3rd party browser that will work on most websites. Here's the link.    mini.opera.com
99bed288200ee8e667e61f471e856b8aaa	No Mercedes-Benz COMAND unit is set to be able to play DVD's. It is illegal in the United States to have playable DVD screens visable from the driver's seat..............However if you are in a metropolitan area, there should be a number of aftermarket customizers that can make the necessary electronic adjustments that allow you to play DVD's. Know there are two settings for this, the main setting only allows movies to play while the car is in Park. (Seriously, what's the point of watching a movie while we're supposed to be paying attention to the road) The cost associate with getting full DVD usage out of the COMAND unit isn't totally worth it. If you're jonesing for a movie that bad, get a portable DVD player.  If you want to locate omeone to do that for you, just ask your local mercedes-benz dealer who they use, and recommend for aftermarket work.
CkW0lc8gaa	Install Motorola Phone Tools (the CD that came with the phone). Check for the latest version by doing Live Update (Menu, Settings, Update). The latest if 4.5.1.    Once done, connect the phone to your PC. Allow the phone to be detected and relevant drivers installed. Start MPT and goto Media Studio. Locate the music files you want to and then transfer to your phone using MPT. It will do the necessary file conversion i.e. format that the phone can use along with correct bit rate etc.
7PWNS6y5aa	you can go Motorola service centre.|`|CkW0lc8gaa	I'm making the assumption that you are refering to the phone software. The simplest way is to:    1. visit your countries Motorola website. There's no a utility that you can download to upgrade software. If you cannot find it, check this out:    http://direct.motorola.com/ENA/SoftwareU...    2. Install the utility  3. Connect your phone using a mini USB cable  4. Backup ALL your phone data  5. Run the utility    Note that you may lose all your customized setting so you'll need to manually reset them.
VlmN3TLeaa	Yes pretty sure the new "Jasper" will still and have a chance of getting the RRoD.

Well ya.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	It's too early to say about the Jasper because it just came out, and it's going to take a few months before the complaints start filing in.    My guess is that they will still get the ring of death, maybe not often as the Zephyr or Falcon.
VlmN3TLeaa	No. They do not check.  I went to go trade in mine a coule weeks ago saying I want to trade it for a new Xbox 360. I got the Elite of course bcuz I had the money.

XHharKJgaa	Like the first answerer, I don't understand why you wouldn't get the iPod back even though you know who took it. If you are young, say below high school, get adults or teachers or administrators or even parents involved. They can do something about it. Just make sure you have the right person. First, just go up to them and ask for it back. If they don't, then get the right people involved.|`|8H3vIlUQaa	Umm if you know who stole it, why don't you get it back? Call the police?

But if your phone is not a smarphone, then you wouldnt need to wory about viruses because cellphones are not 'capable' enough to process a too-much complicated file. Cellphones like the RAZR, K770i, etc. can only install JAVA files, and JAVA files in mobile are very limited that's why most JAVA games are in 2d and JAVA apps are not that good compared to smartphone applications.|`|OyVbOVz9aa	yes  very rare, but if u dont know what ur geting, and they dont want u to see, it likely    it can do stuff like jack up ur blue tooth. those are the ones i have seen

vGxr9e59aa	That's just the nature of the technology.  Learn to be more careful with them.  Always handle them by the edges only and keep them in their cases when not playing them.  If you do that, there's no reason why DVDs shouldn't last you 20-30 years, or longer.|`|VYWaL2graa	Strange. The only time my DVD's get scratched is when I let people borrow them.     Just don't place them face down on anything other than inside the case or the player and you will avoid scratches.|`|AA11814392	No, just a weakness of any technology. VHS are prone to screwed up tapes and so are CDs, LPs, etc.    For any DVD I usually back it up (Read: not distribute) so even it scratches it doesn't mean I wasted money, I just make another copy. Legally, it falls into a gray area, if you can rip music to backup why can't the same be with DVDs?
fwdsp3dVaa	Neither is better or worse then the other! It depends on YOUR situation to determine what is best for YOU!    Plasma TV's are cheaper because the technology is less expensive and there isn't a lot of part outsourcing like there is with LCD's!    With LCD's, you'll find out that a lot of their internal parts are made by a common manufacturer and sold to different brands. You can have a screen made by one manufacturer that is sold to LG, Samsung, Sony etc! But with Plasma's TV Manufacturer's like Panasonic or Pioneer, most if not all of the TV's parts are made In-House by that company...not outsourced! That's what helps keep costs down and makes repairs easier and cheaper too!|`|cbfccc4287377dc8be8cf39e5480816faa	I would definately prefer the LCD to the Plasma, the main reason being that the life of a LCD screen is way more than that of a Plasma screen.    TV Manufacturers are working more to develop the LCD technology and some of them have given up on Plasma. The future of televisions is LCD.    LCD's cost more because the technology used in them is more expensive, but with time this will come down too and so will the issues like the black screen, the viewing angles etc will improve.|`|LZMQzp1Eaa	LCD's are better. plasmas have alot of noise (the speckly dots on your screen).  and lcds produce a sharper image|`|AA11814392	Plasmas AREN'T cheaper than LCDs, nor are they better or worse. Case in point, the Pioneer Kuro - beautiful blacks, pictures, etc. at a wallet crunching price (Up to 4k).    All panels have a quality range, this goes for LCDs and Plasmas. You got the cheap plasmas made by off-brands (not all are bad). And some made by the off-brand LCD makers like Olivia, Dynek, etc. These are pretty much a toss up between the advantages and disadvantages of both panel technologies then its all up to the consumer to pick, basically, these sets have no frills, no bonuses, no cool things, just a simple working set at a low price.    Then you got the higher end LCDs as they transition to OLDE (low power, no backlights) and current LED TVs which also cost up to 4k. They each have their dis/advantages and most of them have really been "fixed" or lessened and don't exhibit most problems older sets do - visibly anyways.|`|W3mm0LdYaa	Simple answer go rent a plasma when it breaks down it gets fixed for free and once u reach the 36 month contract you can buy for $1.00 or give it back and upgrade to new tv great company for this is Radio Rentals

If you can, take a peek inside and try to get some model numbers off of the tubes and google them or search on E-bay.      If they turn out to be highly prized models, you might want to remove them and bring them to a guitar shop with a good amp guy and have him test them to see if they're OK.    There is a growing market for old tubes, mainly by High-Fi buffs and Guitar amp guys.

I have done it many times.  Some people will argue that the quality of signal will suffer but I would bet those same people wouldn't be able to tell the difference in a blind hearing test.  Something to consider, however, is that in a public building like that there may be some regulations that you will need to keep in mind, especially if you are going through walls.  You might need to get specially rated cable to meet fire code regulations.      If this is just for a temporary showing of a movie in the space then use the most cost effective solution.  No one will know the difference.|`|3NKQUIglaa	Don't do that. go to www.monoprice.com for all of your cable and wire needs.

The PlayStation 3 competes with Microsoft's Xbox 360 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles.    A major feature that distinguishes the PlayStation 3 from its predecessors is its unified online gaming service, the PlayStation Network, which contrasts with Sony's former policy of relying on game developers for online play. Other major features of the console include its robust multimedia capabilities, connectivity with the PlayStation Portable, and its use of a high-definition optical disc format, Blu-ray Disc, as its primary storage medium. The PS3 was also the first Blu-ray 2.0-compliant Blu-ray player on the market.    The PlayStation 3 was first released on November 11, 2006 in Japan, November 17, 2006 in North America, and March 23, 2007 in Europe and Oceania. Two SKUs were available at launch: a basic model with a 20 GB hard drive (HDD), and a premium model with a 60 GB hard drive and several additional features (the 20 GB model was not released in Europe or Oceania). Since then, several revisions have been made to the console's available models.    Sony officially unveiled the PlayStation 3 to the public on May 16, 2005, during the E3 2005 conference. A functional version of the system was not present there, nor at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2005, although demonstrations (such as Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots) were held at both events on devkits and comparable PC hardware. Video footage based on the predicted PlayStation 3 specifications was also shown (e.g. Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire).    The initial prototype shown in May 2005 featured two HDMI ports, three Ethernet ports and six USB ports; however, when the system was shown again a year later at E3 2006, these were reduced to one HDMI port, one ethernet port and four USB ports, presumably to cut costs. Two hardware configurations were also announced for the console: a 20 GB model and a 60 GB model, priced at $499 (499) and $599 (599), respectively. The 60 GB model would be the only configuration to feature an HDMI port, Wi-Fi internet, flash card readers and a chrome trim with the logo in silver. Both models were announced for a simultaneous worldwide release: November 11 for Japan, and November 17 for North America and Europe.    On September 6, 2006, Sony announced that the PAL region (Europe and Oceania) PlayStation 3 launch would be delayed until March 2007, due to a shortage of materials used in the Blu-ray Disc drive.    At the Tokyo Game Show on September 22, 2006, Sony announced that it would include an HDMI port on the 20 GB system, but a chrome trim, flash card readers, silver logo, and Wi-Fi would not be included. Also, the launch price of the Japanese 20 GB model was reduced by over 20%, and the 60 GB model was announced for an open pricing scheme in Japan. During the event, Sony showed 27 playable PS3 titles running on final hardware.

It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.

Some would consider the Nikon D80 as affordable, while others would consider the D40 too pricey.    If you are looking at DSLR, the Nikon D40 is a great way to get into photography. But you will run into limitation with the lens selection if you must have autofocus. I use the Nikon 50mm f/1.8 lens with my D40, and miss a split prism for focusing ease. If you need autofocus, then the D80 would be camera to target. Canon has their comparable models, but I am not that familiar with the Canons.|`|0AqkCOWIaa	You say you are a beginner photographer, so you are going to want to start with an SLR camera. You say that you are on a budget. Digital SLRs are rather expensive, the cheapest being 430$ with a lens, and the most expensive being $39,000, but you aren't going to start with a camera of that price, obviously. If you do not have $430 ( at least ) to spend on a Digital SLR, you can always go with film, it's a little more of a hassle, but the images will be just as good. You can go on Ebay.com, and find many used SLRs for cheap prices. If you can afford a Digital, I would recommend the Canon Rebel XSI, or the D60, if they are too expensive for you, consider the D40.
EWuVYSOXaa	There is an app that allows you to print using a Mac computer and printer but there isn't anything like that for Windows or Linux users.  Even if you get the phone off of Ebay you will still have to get the data plan and if you try to use it without the plan it will be flagged and you will be given the choice to discontinue service on the phone or get the plan since this is part of the contract with any iPhone.|`|KNYF1hnhaa	At this time you can not print directly from the iPhone.  No matter where you go to get the iPhone, you will have to have a monthly plan to use all the features of it.  Without a plan, all you can do is use Wi-Fi.    Also if there is still time left on the original one year warranty, that follows the phone to the new owner.  Apple supports the phone and not the customer, so unless the iPhone is unlocked or has accidental damage, any remaining days left in the original warranty would still be valid.|`|9D2l26mOaa	no and yes|`|LcnSBvqWaa	if you buy an iphone online you don't have a warrenty plus you need to go to your provider to get a special sim card.. along with the fact you'll need to upgrade to a data plan or you'll have a crazy insane phone bill|`|XOdzZkOxaa	u cant print from an iphone..hello does it have a printer?... u can buy 1 off ebay but u wont be able to use it until u sign up for a contract..
c33FAkx4aa	There is no harmful radiation coming from cell phones.  The HARMFUL radiation is known as Ionizing Radiation.  Alpha, Beta and Gamma radiation are classified as Ionizing Radiation.      Cell phones (and all other electronics on earth) emit Electro-Magnetic Radiation.  It is NON-Ionizing.  There is NO HARMFUL RADIATION FROM CELL PHONES!|`|WrdfZdM4aa	Please note, that many "made in China" cell phones has the same design from the outside, but inside is absolutely different hardware.  The best thing to buy from known manufacturer, not just noname item.  Usually well-known factory has all required certificates and watch over production process to avoid any harm for people in future.  Especially if it's makes handsets for export.  But, I want also to mention, that such small level of radiation like was in old Sony Ericsson T68 - never was reached in any other handset...|`|h3yQMguraa	If you're worried about radiation, buy a Geiger counter and test it.  I would be more worried about usability issues or longevity when using a Chinese handset.

vJj6lo4faa	Let me answer your question in SHORT.    Yes, you have to install them games.  Thats why they provide hard disk in the  console.  Thats why the load time is faster compared to other consoles as it reads from the hard disk and not the dvds.    hope it helps.|`|pl2SocVKaa	no it just means you have to have that amount of gb left on your ps3 to play it so it doesn't even matter you have 80gb and the only games you install are psn games and most games take up between 90-500mb depending on the game|`|VcNHahtgaa	I recently bought mine also :P    But I think you can delete them also whenever you want like demos. Like, I know my cousin played over 10 PS3 games and bought 3 PSN games and he only has a 20GB launch model. He didn't even upgrade it lol.      EDIT:  Oh yeah, you can upgrade your PS3 hard drive whenever you want. You can get 320GB for about $80, you can use it like a memory card for PS2 I think.    And wow... the guy above me just copied and paste that from like Wikipedia and didn't even answer your question.|`|9AR6B4ELaa	tht's why they provide that damn hard drive. but not all games needs installing. the big games like the final fantasy might need installing.|`|JPDpxPc2aa	Not all games need installs. Some developers just duplicate data on the disc so you don't have to install games to reduce load times.    Uncharted is 1 example.|`|lebKMTaQaa	I'm probably just going to be repeating what others here have said, but let me summarize it for you anyway.    The initial install that some games have is to help with load times and keep the game running rather than having to sit through long load screens. Not all, in fact most games do not use this feature. This install is required for that particular game, and there is no way to keep it from doing so (not that you would want to anyway).    You will still need the discs. That is a very small portion of the information on the disc. Remember, a Blu-ray can hold 25 GB normal or 50 GB if it is dual layered.    Advantage, again saves on load time and keeps the game running smooth and looking smooth.    I have 20 games right now, each with 1 to 5 saves, have downloaded about 40 songs for RB, and a few different wallpapers. I have used about 28 GB on my 60 GB machine. I still have plenty of room, even with the required installs, firmware updates and downloaded content.    If you plan on downloading a lot of permanent stuff (movies, music, full games, etc) you may want to replace you hard drive with a larger one. However if you plan on moving these downloads out of your PS3 and/or deleting saves as you go, you should be OK.

vc7yohelaa	Everything looks compatible, although I would consider getting a name brand power supply like Antec. I'm not sure of the power requirements on the 3870, but i know my 3870x2 sucks up a ton of juice, and that PSU might not have enough Wattage.    Also, Why not go with a SATA hard drive? they have faster data transfer rates, and are easier to setup since (last time I used one) IDE hard drives require you to set the drive to master or slave.     AND make sure that you have an extra SATA cable lying around, because that optical drive you're buying is OEM so it isn't going to come with any burning software or cables. Same with the OEM hard drive

Plus, you could get caught and have serious consequences. And even if you don't get caught you will have to live with a guilty conscience. If you steal, that makes you no better than any other person that you would classify as a thief. There's no exception for you.    Here are so better alternatives to stealing an iPod:  1)If you really want an iPod, you can probably find one pretty cheap on eBay.   2)Other kinds of MP3 players such as Zunes are typically cheaper than iPods, so that's another option.   3)You could explain to your parents how badly you want an iPod and maybe they'll help you buy one or get you one as a gift.  4) This is a fun one. Ask a bunch of different people if you can have a very small amount of money (never more than a dollar). It'll add up really fast and chances are they won't bother to have you pay them back.    So please, don't steal someone's iPod. You'll really upset that person. Not to mention all of the risks involved.|`|sux1aIHEaa	ask your parents to buy you one off of ebay.  do not steal one because what if you just get one and someone steals it from you.  someone stole my ipod....i've had FOUR ipods already.|`|1thElV58aa	your a mean PERSON! do you know how hard some peoples parents have to work to get their child an ipod, once their ipods get stolen that break there heart.

HBNx77BBaa	Sorry, but if there was a camera like that nobody would be using anything else.    Low noise in low light demands a large sensor. Not loads of megapixels, in fact quite the opposite. The sensor must be big. DSLR sensors are much bigger than the sensors in compact cameras. So-called 'bridge' cameras are just compact cameras with big zoom lenses.    You could get a DSLR for that money but no lens. Certainly not an 18x zoom. You put noise at the top of your list, so maybe you do want to look at a DSLR. For starters compare the Canon 1000D, the Nikon D60 and the Nikon D40. The D40 is pretty old, but well-liked and affordable. You can get the cameras with an image stabilised 3x zoom 'kit' lens which performs very well. The D40 may not be sold with an image stabilised kit lens (vibration reduction in Nikon-speak) so check that first. All of these options will exceed $AU500.    dpreview.com is a good place to get reviews of these cameras.    If it is the 18x zoom and image stabilisation that you don't want to compromise on then have a look at the Panasonic Lumix FZ28. I think it will be within your budget just about. The top shutter speed doesn't much matter to he honest. There's rarely enough light for a compact camera to use it's top speed. With good technique you can get succesful shots of sports - you have to use pre-focussing and panning and rely on a bit of luck too but when you take lots of pictures some will work out.|`|nU5UqACUaa	add a couple of zeros to your price and I will answer your question.  Curious, Nikon D700 ...........|`|3mAgM405aa	If you are really on a budget and want the best quality for the money, check out the P&S Panasonic Lumix DMC-FZ28 [with a Leica lense] which has more features than most pro DSLRs that require auxiliary lenses not even equal to the single initial full-range lense that comes with the FZ28. It is reviewed at:    http://www.steves-digicams.com/2008_revi...    It just came out on November 4, 2008.    It's an all-in-one 10.1 megapixel digital camera which includes (i) built-in image stabilization; (ii) HD720 quality video [Quicktime] which permits zooming while videoing; (iii) a 18x zoom [27 - 486 mm (35mm equiv.)] "Leica" lense for nature photography; (iv) up to 0.39 inch macro option; (v) up to 6400 ASA; (vi) takes up to 380 pictures per 120 min. battery charge; (vii) has a "burst speed" of 13 fps; and sells new for $320 at amazon.com.    Here's an actual handheld picture of the moon:    http://g-ecx.images-amazon.com/images/G/...

e4hMIUGCaa	Call divert means : to transfer a call to another number,if the original number being called is not active or in a blankspot area,or in a busy.Or Redirect. It is not TO TAP a phone.  I think the provider want to remind its subscriber,and NOT intend to give a warning that a divert call is in active mode.  Moreover, you have  just deactivated your divert option.As long as your phone is active and in network coverage area,you will always receive all calls aimed to your number.  To make sure if your divert call is really active or not,you can check this way.  .. Switch off your phone.   .. Take another phone,homephone or you can borrow it from your friend,CALL your number   .. Listen to what your provider says,if :  = if it is said that " the number you dial is not active or out of coverage area,please call again later..."(or something like that) its mean that you really have NO active divert,even if it is noted so in your phone screen.  = if a sound says " your calls is being diverted (or transfered or redirected),please wait...!"

But, it has a slow processor and low RAM which is not suitable for its operating system. I also don't like its joystick. Then, I saw an ad about Nokia N78, which is the successor of Nokia N73. I found that N78 has more RAM (96 MB), faster processor (369 MHz) features than N73 like Wi-Fi, autofocus (in camera), newer operating system etc and has a comfortable and flexible cursor supporting Navi-Wheel instead of the uncomfortable joystick. So, I bought it instead of N73. N73 often stops working and hangs. Whereas, after updating the firmware to version 20.149, my N78 has been working faster and perfectly, without hanging. I recommend you to buy Nokia N78 instead, but it costs a little higher.|`|exe5U7ZUaa	Look for it in here :  http://www.fonearena.com/nokia-n73_345.h...
CkW0lc8gaa	I'm making the assumption that you are using a Motorola phone and that you are using the Java application to connect to the internet using GPRS.    All Motorola phones will have a telco GPRS settings. If not, please get your telco to send you the setting via browser message. You can then save the settings. To access the internet using a 3rd party browser like Opera Mini, one needs to setup the Java session. Simply copy your telco GPRS settings to another new session e.g. Temp. Open the Temp settings and take note of the following:    1. Port number  2. DNS (if required)  3. GPRS APN  4. Login (if required)  5. Password (if required)  6. Proxy (if required)    Manually enter this into your phone. The default GPRS session should still be your telco GPRS settings.

My V6 Maxx allows printing via Bluetooth so that's another option.|`|b2972287e366f5c1407c131b23fd7144aa	Don't think your service provider can help, what mobile are you using, the later models of mobiles allows you to synchronize with your PC or Laptop, from there you can print out the text that you received, not sure about those you sent.|`|ed6c4b98ac329b35245eb1dfc3f3cd31aa	go online and sign into your account and print out your text from there
CkW0lc8gaa	Try this:    1. Transfer the entire file over to your phone  2. Then transfer it back under a new name (if you prefer)  3. Edit the transferred version    Here's the logic. The transfer will convert the file to a version the phone will recognise i.e. correct bit rate, size etc. Then edit the recognized version. It should work.    Have fun!
CkW0lc8gaa	Try Opera Mini. It allows you to access most websites. Here's the link:    mini.opera.com    Open you phone browser and type in that address. Download and install.    If you are using a Motorola phone, you'll need to configure your Java Session to match your telco GPRS settings.    Another neat feature of Opera Mini is that you can suppress download of pics => savings in terms of data download and improve download time. As a bonus, the browser has a counter that measures data volume.
CkW0lc8gaa	Absolutely! That's why usage of cell phones in cars is banned in some countries. Studies have shown that even drivers who use a hands free set experience reduced response time and are unable to react as well to a road situation. This was featured in a Mythbusters episode :-)
CkW0lc8gaa	Use Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). It comes with your phone. Follow these steps:    1. Install MPT  2. Check for updates (latest is 4.5.1c) using the Live Update function within Setup  3. Connect your phone to your PC only when all updates completed. It will detect your phone  4. Launch MPT after the phone has been successfully detected and the right drivers installed  5. Once connected, use Media Studio then File Transfer  6. MPT will convert the file into a format that the phone can use    Have fun!

CkW0lc8gaa	You need to check with you telco. Some use GPRS to download MMS so you'll need to check that your settings are correct.

CkW0lc8gaa	It's the phones unique ID. Take note of the number and record it in a safe place. If your phone is ever lost or stolen you can use it to positively identify your phone. Some telcos can block the IMEI so the phone cannot be used on that network. In the event the phone is recovered, you can also use the IMEI to claim the phone back.    To get your IMEI, press * 06  on your phone.|`|AA12133366	Because if your phone is stolen you call the service provider, and have them shut it off.  If and when the person who stole it tries to turn it on, they will have to give the service provider the IEMI number, which will register as a stolen phone.  Voilla you find who stole your phone, and would probably get it back.  Your IEMI is also used when determining insurance claims.  I know that every time I have had to make a claim on my cell insurance, they have to make sure that my IEMI matches the IEMI that they have on record.  I hope this helps you understand a little bit better.|`|IKZLG2ngaa	I beleive that your mobile phone provider can block the handset from use should it be stolen.  They require the IMEI number in order to ensure that they are blocking the correct phone.      Usually when someone steals a phone, they can put their own SIM card in and use the phone.  If it is blocked, then no SIM card will work in the phone. It is meant to deter people from stealing mobile phones.

You need to take it back to the mall and turn it in at the main desk. Think of how the owner would feel. I've lost my phone before and the person that found it kept it. Not only did they keep it but they also used it. The calls they made didn't get charged to me but the problem was that it was an expensive new phone that had expensive accessories on it too (flashing antennae, phone case, face plate...).    And SLVRs are also expensive. You really need to take it back. If you don't believe in karma then think of how you would feel. You'd feel like crap wouldn't you?|`|vb75goZCaa	ummm what go back to the mall ummmmm no if the phone still has service on it simply go throught the contacts find a number thats marked home not cell and call and inform them you found their phone or if you dont feel confident doing that go to a cingular STORE not the booth at the mall and they can find the number in that phone call the customer  and mail it to them or let them pick it up at the store|`|CkW0lc8gaa	Do yourself a favour. Try locating the owner so you can return the phone. Put yourself in their shoes. Imagine having lost all your contacts and now having to recontruct. Would you like someone to return a phone you lost!    Pay it forward. Someone wil return the favour in an unexpected way. Feel good by making someones day. You have the power to make the world a better place.
CkW0lc8gaa	Yes. Here's how:  1. Subscribe to a data plan from your telco. Select a plan that meets your needs. E.g. if you are light user, then go for a volume based plan. If you intend to use your phone as a modem for your PC, then go for an unlimted plan.  2. Get your telco to send you their GPRS configuration. It's normally sent in the form of a browser message. Save the settings.  3. If you are using a Motorola phone, take note of the setting and copy it to Java Session within your web sessions.  4. Using your phone browser, point it to:  mini.opera.com  5. Download and install.    You can now surf the web using Opera Mini. I recommend disabling pic download to save data.    To use your phone as a modem for your PC, install the software that came with your phone. In the case of Motorola, it's called Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). MPT has Internet Connection sessions. That's how you connect to the net.    Have fun!
CkW0lc8gaa	If you are using a Motorola Phone, try Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). It comes with the phone. There's a function Media Studio that will allow you to create your own ring tones. You can even record your own sound bits or use existing sound files and edit them to your satisfaction. The phone can be connected to the PC using bluetooth. You can also transfer the file to your phone. MPT will do the necessary conversion so the file will work on your phone.

CkW0lc8gaa	The approach will vary depending on content.    1. For ringtones, music, just copy it to your PC and then transfer it over to your new phone. If you old and new phone has bluetooth, your can just transfer it directly.  2. For Java midlets, you'll need to identify the renamed Java Jar file. Here's a good article on how to do this on Motorola phones.    http://moto.ninetoez.net/backupjava.html
10ee80f07044671193924f54637f7685aa	Most cell phones only let you record one end of the conversation if it lets you record at all. This is because some states have laws that do not allow phone calls to be recorded unless all parties involved agree to the recording.|`|bf868d4ae7172d6fb6bec9fc89aae0f1aa	no, and it would be illegal if there was|`|vlgMRJWxaa	If there's a recorder on your phone, mess with it to see if you could record convos.

CkW0lc8gaa	Do the following:  1. Update to the latest Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). Under Setup, Live Update. DO NOT connect your phone yet.  2. Install the latest 4.5.1c.  3. Turn off your phone and let it sit for 30 seconds. Then turn it back on. Allow the phone to fully cycle before connecting to PC.  4. Connect your phone.  5. Let the PC detect the necessary software. Allow the process to fully complete.  6. Launch MPT    If you phone still does NOT connect, try this:  http://developer.motorola.com/docstools/...    Use the application to uninstall the drivers and then reinstall. Again, ensure your phone is NOT connected until this is completed. Once done, reconnect your phone and let the PC install the drivers. Launch MPT.    If this fails, try Bluetooth.  1. Under Setup, Connect to different phone.  2. Select bluetooth.  3. Follow instructions on the screen.    MPT is finicky. I recommend you have all other applications shut down while it is running including Outlook. If you like to archive your text messages, export them to a file so you can restore if necessary.    Have fun!
CkW0lc8gaa	Best Answer - Chosen by Asker     Here's what I would do:    1. install Motorola Phone Tools then under Setup, Live update, check for the latest version which is 4.5.1c  2. install the latest version  3. plug in your phone  4. run Motorola Phone Tools  5. let the phone connect (you'll know it's connected when you can see your telco and the globe sign)  6. Media Studio, File Transfer    You can edit, even record your own sound files within media studio. It's under Tools. For pictures, you can also edit then transfer. Try it! It's loads of fun.    Enjoy!

CkW0lc8gaa	An easier way is to use Bluetooth. Here's how:    1. Pair the phone with your PC.  2. Setup Bluetooth with OBEX Object Push.  3. Double click on the Bluetooth icon on your task bar.  4. View devices in range.  5. Select your phone.  6. Double click on your phone icon.  7. Drag and drop the Jar file to OBEX Object Push.  8. Your phone will prompt "Do you want to connect with your PC?".  9. Accept and the transfer will begin. Once complete, it will prompt you to install.

aVgjUkX3aa	Well for what you want you won't really find one with direct record function. usually most are either 2,4, or 8gb like the Creative V plus. those have the functions your looking except for the 20gigs. to tell you the truth the good customer support is a tricky one cause they will all offer you something diffrent on that and its a chance of luck. The Zune is good but the battery isn't as long as the I Pod but then you lose the FM tuner function. Go with either the zune or the Creative Vision M not the W its a lot more. thats probably as close as you will get to what your looking for. by the way the vision M has a 18hr audio play back the Zune 13hr and i pod at least 20hrs if not more.... oh and if you want a full charge make sure you buy a wall charger, that whole PC charging won't get you a full charge.  laters|`|AA11359237	Go buy a ipod, they are easy to use, once you set it up, you plug it to your comp, import your folder, and sync, nothing to it.

CkW0lc8gaa	Depends on your telco. Mine allows you to connect up to 5 others. Here's how:    1. Either call or get the other party to call.  2. Once the call is connected, there'll be some options on your soft keys.  3. Select make new call or answer new call.  4. Once connected, select conference or link calls (depends on your phone menu).  5. Continue doing this until you have all fix connected or you have the parties you need connected.    Have fun!

CkW0lc8gaa	Most of the newer phones come with software for your PC. I'm using Motorola phones and it comes with Motorola Phone Tools (MPT).

CkW0lc8gaa	It could well that the file type is unsupported. The best way to ensure that ringtones will work is to use Motorola Phone Tools (MPT). During the file transfer process, MPT will make the necessary conversion i.e. file size, bit rate etc. You can use bluetooth or the USB cable. I recommend using the USB cable as bluetooth can be very slow depending on file size. It also drains your batteries rather quickly.
CkW0lc8gaa	Yes you can. Goto your phonebook, the do the following:    1. select all your phone contacts  2. copy to SIM    Note that most SIM cards have a limit of 200 entries.  Chances are your telco has already included load of other entries already e.g. help desk, support, roaming numbers etc. In addition, SIM cards do not store data the same way as a phone does. E.g. Your phone will store multiple entries for a contact i.e. email, office, mob, home  etc. The SIM stores it as seperate entrties. This means that when u migrate phones  and copy over the SIM entries, it will come out seperate entries. A better way is to use Motorola Phone Tools and copy all your entries to Outlook. That makes data migration much easier.

SKkE3fK1aa	There are 2 types of plans, the kilobyte charge and the hourly charge.    KB charges are for services that charge you for every KB that gets transferred to and from your phone.    Hourly charges are for services that gives you an amount of time or days or months, before charging you.    If you do not use internet too much on your phone, i suggest switching to KB charges. however, if you use internet on your phone alot then 35 a month isnt 'high'.|`|JwPu0XbIaa	Because people are willing to pay it.  It's as simple as that.    A company will charge whatever price gives them the highest profit.  If they charge too low a price, they won't make much money.  If they charge too high a price, few people will use their product, and they won't make much money.  Somewhere in-between, there is a price that maximizes their profit.|`|QOfwK537aa	because cell phone companies want their money too. =[

AA10903893	You've pretty much answered you own question.  Financially, the is no reason to attempt to get this camera repaired.  It is old, outdated and would cost far more than the camera is now worth.    The real question then becomes what are the pictures stored in the internal memory are worth to you.  Other than that, yes the prudent move would be to go for a new camera.    Side Note:   Have you tried putting a memory card into the camera and copying the pictures from internal memory to the card rather than trying to go directly to the computer?  Or does it not stay on long enough for that type of transfer either?  |`|QhkZLFKoaa	I would say it depends on how you normally get your photos off of your phone and the value of the photos themselves.  I would first try to keep the camera plugged into the wall (charging) while hooking it up to your computer (to get the pictures off).  Ultimately repairing a three year old digital camera is not worth it unless the pictures on the memory card are very valuable to you.  Instead keep an eye out for new cameras for sale, you can find some great deals on digital cameras online, I suggest watching sites like woot.com or slickdeals.net  |`|adTUcnIGaa	No, smash it and claim off your insurance.|`|iUywFkuNaa	In the digital electronics world, 3years is a long time, advances in both tecknolgy and lower prices make the next generation of camers a steal compared to repairing an old one!|`|GQjnabYvaa	No. Just get yourself a new one from comet their really cheap about 60 for a decent samsung or sony one.  http://www.comet.co.uk/shopcomet/search....    and if you want to treat yourself you can get a 10.1 megapixel one which would cost you about 200  or even less!
AA10903893	Do you have an SD Card Reader on your MAC or one that you can plug in?    It would probably be easier (and quicker) to take the memory card from the camera and transfer the pictures that way directly, rather than tethering the camera to the computer.|`|8AYA5gTBaa	If your camera is taking too long to download, it might be doing an auto-shutdown.    If your Mac has more than 1 USB port, try the other one. Depending on the model of computer, sometimes one port might be sharing it's bandwidth with the internal USB bus. Switching might speed up the download.    If that doesn't work, try using iPhoto rather than the Easyshare software. It's excellent software and is already installed. It might be more efficient in downloading your photos.    If that doesn't work, consider getting a card reader. They are inexpensive ($10-15), and you can avoid the whole camera shut-down problem.    You can get a cheap card reader from online companies like this one:  http://www.supermediastore.com/

You will get a cord the use (you can always keep it plugged in to basically have a wired controller)  and a battery pack that doesnt use disposable batteries.  But if you want, you can always use the other battery pack (the one that uses disposable batts) with no batteries in it, with the cord attached, and it will work.  Its around $20.    Also, sometimes they can break easily, so be careful when unplugging them, such as dont pull the cord, pull the thing that plugs into the controller/xbox.

The G1 is just a mimick with some add-ons of the iPhone itself. If the iPhone never existed, neither would the G1 because Google and T-Mobile are just trying to compete. Yeah the G1 has it's own advantages to the iPhone and it's disadvantages as well. The G1 is not attractive at all, the freakin phone is fat. On the other hand the iPhone looks gorgeous. The G1 has a real QWERTY keyboard but I only find that distracting. The iPhone has rich content made with elegant polished software from a company with years of experience with rich software creation on devices (iPods) as well as computers (Mac). But Google just had it's first launch of a device. I say iPhone.

Right now tho there are no bundles, but there might be a killzone 2 bundle coming out when the April reduction hits. unless you go somewhere where there is a different currency, like a different country, the price is the exact same.

There is Wi-Fi, 2G, and 3G. Wi-Fi is the stuff you use on the iPod Touch and for your computer. 2G and 3G is the same as Wi-Fi, but it is slower and you can get 2G or 3G wherever you can get a cell phone signal. The iPhone 3G comes in 8 GB and 16 GB. The 8 GB is $199 and the 16 GB is $299, but keep in mind the expensive contract including the data plan. And yes, you sync songs to your iPhone the same as you would with an iPod, through iTunes and the sync cable.    Hope I helped!

Or if you really want to be cheap, the Creative Zen Stone (1GB $40) is pretty good. Its just like the Ipod shuffle, but a tiny bit bigger, but a whole lot cheaper. It doesn't have any features, but has good sound quality|`|2e5ad6f02cc76fce30db21a1d7700cb7aa	I have Sansa. I've had it for 1.5 yrs and I like it. It has a radio (and I can record radio, when I hear a song I like); it has enough memory for my 500 songs and I can still add more. And you always can use a memory card to have additional space. The battery lasts up to 4 days ( I used it about 5-6 hours a day on my trip). Charging is easy, just plug it into your computer when it's on. And it's less expensive... Hope this helps.  Good luck!

7tJZ4mp2aa	This should be easy.  First assuming your TV is indeed cable-ready (any sold in the past 20 years should be), look for a switch or setting in the menu for "antenna" versus "cable".  Set it to "cable".    The reasoning here is that channels 2-13 are the same for antenna and cable, but antenna channels 14-69 are totally different frequencies than cable 14-100+.    Actually there are a few frequencies that do overlap in the UHF band so that's why you probably pick up a few beyond ch 13.

You might be able to get 60gbs avail online for a tad bit cheaper but i'd spend the extra dollar and buy the 80gb.|`|AA10856937	Yeah, they have 80 gig ipods.  Look on apple.com.  They have some re-furbished sometimes in a section of the online store that you can get for the same price as the 30gb.|`|Jb9Eme0vaa	The 60GB is no longer made by Apple, it was replaced by the 80GB. Wal-Mart does not usually carry them. If you want to put 8,000 songs on it, you need the 80GB, because the 30GB only holds 7,500 songs, or less with videos. The iPod has a standard price, everywhere. The stores that usually have 80GBs are; Circuit City, Target, Best Buy, & Apple Store. Maybe Wal-Mart.com has 80GB. If you want to save a little money for a 60GB, go to eBay, but that's probably not the best choice. You could also cut 1,000 songs out of you're library and save $100 by getting the 30GB.

AA10903893	There are sensor cleaning kits.  However, they are really meant for dust and not "growth" or anything of that nature.  Your best bet is to find a authorized Canon center and getting them to clean it.  It will run you around $50 or so, but that is much cheaper than a new camera, and if they make a mistake cleaning it, they will have to fix it, if you try this yourself and do something wrong trying to get that growth out, you are out of luck.    Once you do that, make sure you start storing your camera in a dry location.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Do take it to a camera repair shop... if they ruin it, they'll have to pay for the damages (new parts, etc.)|`|nxdvuT0daa	Do not attempt to clean it by yourself, I saw it before you might get lucky and you wont destroy you sensor but if it is a fungus growth it will re appear in a matter of days, take your camera to a workshop and let them do full system cleanup and after that do not attempt to change the lens in a humid conditions.|`|n71t0xoCaa	I have to agree with everyone here. If you are not thouroughly trained to clean the highpas filter and sensor do not do it. It will be money well spent to let someone else do it right and not mess it up. Lets hope the fungus is only on the highpass filter that way it should be able to be cleaned and if not the highpass filter is much less expensive than a sensor. 
AA10903893	First the Definitions (simplistic, not technical):    Telephoto - Single Focal Length Lens that can shoot at far distances  300mm 400mm etc.  Whatever you see is what you can get, there is no "Zooming" or widening of the frame.    Telephoto Zoom - Lenses that can shoot at a range of distances within a single lens, so you can have a (fairly) wide angle and zoom in to subjects further away.  They are typically not as sharp as Telephotos, but they are more versitile and generally cheaper.    What would probably suit you best would be a Telephoto Zoom lens such as the Tamrom 28 - 200 mm. lens.  It is a single lens that will allow you to take regular shots but also the ability to zoom in on subjects at a distance.  It runs about $285, but will cover most of your basic needs without needing to buy several different lenses or needing to swap lenses quite so often.|`|i5OVORXgaa	Canon EF 75-300mm f/4-5.6 III Telephoto Zoom Lens   http://www.amazon.com/Canon-75-300mm-4-5...    |`|3TqPF1zMaa	What subjects do you want to make pictures of?

EKCp8DkPaa	Nikon D700 12.1MP Digital SLR Camera - $2700.00    Awesome dynamic range and low light capability!     I purchased the Nikon D700 about three weeks ago from Computizone.com and it is an awesome camera. My previous frame of reference is my four year old Canon 20D and the D700 beats the Canon on every front.     The added dynamic range of the Nikon's full-frame sensor means most photos are well exposed - including the sky and shadows. Often only minor adjustments are required post camera (I use Lightroom 2). I've also found that the autofocus on the Nikon D700 is light years ahead of the Canon. Focusing is not a problem.     Then there is the low light performance of the Nikon D700. Wow! Indoor photography without flash is now possible. I purchased my D700 in a kit with Nikon's 24-120 mm zoom lense with vibration reduction. The vibration reduction combined with the ability to shoot at higher ISO settings means photos of moving subjects can be shot at higher shutter speeds - resulting in less blur.     Overall, I am very satisfied with the D700.        |`|AA10903893	Most "Professional" cameras are at $3000 and MORE.    What you want to look at is wholly dependent on what you plan on shooting.  For example, the Canon 5D Mark II ($2699) is a full frame camera that takes (based on samples) excellent pictures and is a good camera for lanscape and portrait work with 21 MP of resolution, but at 3.9 frames per second is probably too slow for wildlife or sports shooting.    The Nikon D700 (approx $2795) is faster at 8 frames per second (with special battery add-on), and is excellent in low light, but with 12 MP of resolution is not as good for portrait and landscape work.    |`|Efd1G2loaa	The best? Probably an 8x10 Arca Swiss or Toyo View. I know Wisners are good, too. A Graflex would be a good cheaper alternative. Or, if you were needing a smaller format, you might consider a Pentax 67.
AA10903893	There is no way to come up with a valid answer based on megapixels alone.    A dSLR with an 8MP sensor will outperform a 10MP point and shoot every time of course, but even within point and shoot cameras, some 10MP will be better, some 8 MP will be better, it depends on brand, model, sensor and many other factors beyond the number of megapixels in the sensor.|`|KIBGC8ZAaa	well, if you want more, then how about trying sony cybershot w300- it's 13.6mp or a canon which has 14.7mp...|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It depends more on the size of the sensor ... 8 mp on a large sensor will out perform a 10 mp sensor on a small sensor    http://www.kenrockwell.com/tech/mpmyth.h...    How do you know which sensor is larger?    http://www.dpreview.com/learn/?/Glossary...
AA10903893	The Cybershot wins if you want the most gimmicks and "extras."  But if you want the ability to zoom in more (10x vs. 5x), be able to shoot in burst mode (3 pics per second vs 1.6), or want to stay away from proprietary Memory Stick memory, then the3 Panasonic wins out.

I8yV5Hglaa	1000 songs is about equal to 4 GB.    So with the 16GB model, you'll still have 12 GB leftover for video.    1 hour of video takes about 0.8 GB in iPod format, so that is 15 hours of video, or about 6 full-length movies.    So the 16 GB model should be fine for you.  Even if you need a little extra space, you can just have four movies on at a time instead... and you'll save yourself $100.|`|2K43LgeWaa	If your going to be doing what you said, then go with the 16gb, i have the 8gb and it fits all of what you said on it.|`|AA11706004	I'd go 32, just because it has the extra space if you want it later.|`|ElLBELGeaa	Well if it's just for internet, calender and email maybe the 16gb would be best|`|zbXkyCOTaa	get the 16 you prolly wont even need a 16 i have a 8gb and i got tons of songs on itt and it is not even close to bein full but yea youll love the internet and apps you can get for it|`|NbsVccbaaa	i think you should get 32G because songs keep coming out and if tou get 16GB and fill it up you cant put the new songs on

When you get a memory overload during playing a game or listening to music it shoots you back to the home screen.  --------  1- The fix they said is hold the Home and the Sleep button till they shut off. 2- Turn off Wi-fi when not using Clear Cache and Cookies and all on internet.  3- If able to Restore the Ipod.

zpmXGZsCaa	There are some good answers above.  I have been playing synths for a number of years and currently own several.  I assume you want to buy a synthesizer as a gift for him.      As mentioned above, the Microkorg is good.  It looks funny because it has miniature keys, but it sounds great.  And as mentioned,, it has a vocoder which is a mic that sends your vocals to the keys being played.  Microkorgs are about $400 online or from music chains like Guitar Center.      Here are a few other choices:     Alesis Micron - $400 - Small like the Microkorg, but with full sized keys.  Great synthesizer sounds (better than the Microkorg IMO.)    Korg Microkorg XL - $500 - This is the new replacement for the Microkorg above.  It just hit the street, so it may be hard to find right away.  Small keys like the original, but huge sound.        Korg Micro X - $500 - Full sized keys, small keyboard, great sounds.     Korg R3 - $550 - Full size keys, small keyboard, great sounds, and built in vocoder.     Yamaha MM6 - $600 - Nice synth especially for piano, electric piano, and organ sounds.  Good synth sounds too.  The best synth on this list for people wanting good piano and electric piano sounds with their synth.      Roland Juno D - $600 - Good Roland synth.  It's been around for over six years though - might be a bit dated sound wise.      Roland SH-201 - $600 - Lots of knobs to tweak - great sounds - a good first synth for anyone.  If your bf likes to turn knobs, this may be the one for him.        Korg X-50 - $700 - My personal favorite of this list.  Cool looking, great sounding, 61 full size keys.        Basically a complete list of new synths priced $400 - $700.  Used synths can be had cheaper of course, but that would take a few pages to lists.|`|PumYhJSvaa	My husband has a micro-korg and he spent around 300 on it. It comes with a vocoder and he loves it.|`|7HMNeRvsaa	Have a look on  http://www.guitarampkeyboard.com/en/korg...  or http://www.gear4music.com/search/synth/f...

LzSj90pbaa	The iphone does not have all the features people think. Ill just compare the fuze and bold to the iphone.  The only feature the Iphone has that the bold does not is an accelerator (the fuze has one).  The fuze does not have a single feature the iphone doesnt.  The things that both the fuze and bold have the iphone doesnt:  Mp3 ringtones  sms ringtones  installable third party media players  drag and drop program installation  drag and drop file transfer  gps with turn by turn directions  bluetooth stereo  blueooth file transfer  internet tethering  visual missed call/text alert  java  MMS + text forwarding  voice dialing  Both phones play more video formats  Video recording  Multitasking  camera zoom + LED flash    Now onto the applications. Its impossible to compare the apps for two phones without knowing what you need. For example, if you watch movies on your phone, then you should know that you can install third party media players for both the fuze and the bold that will allow you to play any format and any size video, so there is no need to convert it.  The iphone has a very basic multimedia player so you have to format any video to the exact specs of the phone before you can play it. Apple does not allow third party media players for the iphone.  next is the app store.  The app store is convenient in the fact that apple has brought all the apps for the phone to one spot. On the other hand, you cannot install any programs that apple does not approve of for the itunes store. Because they deny applications that mimic or improve on their native apps, youll never have a better multimedia player or a better texting program.|`|OJShm63saa	no I have been monitoring the cell phone market ever since I got my 3g iphone...every time there's a phone that gets hyped as an "iphone killer" it grossly fails to even matching the iphone.    some people are contrarians so they're anti-iphone...I was like that, but I realized that the iphone is just flat out better

381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	There is no 2g iPhone.  It's just an iPhone.  The 3G doesn't refer to 3rd generation.  3G is the network that's used for data transfer.  It's faster than Edge, which is what the original iPhone uses.    Anyway, AT&T can't force him into a 2 year deal because Apple didn't subsidize the original iPhone.  People who bought the iPhone paid the full amount.  Apple didn't give a discount.  Apple did subsidize the 3G, so they can force you into a 2 year contract.  The original iPhone was 300/400 bucks, and the new 3G is 200/300 bucks.      AT&T will activate the phone for him.
SKkE3fK1aa	just update your drivers. If you are using an OEM (computers that were already built when you buy them, like HP, Dell, Acer, etc.) then go to their website and download the new drivers    If you are using a Self-built PC (meaning you assembled your PC from scratch) then you go to your Motherboard (or SoundCard)'s website and dowload drivers from there on.    Or use Windows Update to update your PC and get your drivers 1-touch.
CKRfaRYvaa	As long as the phone is new enough to be E-911 compatible, then you can still activate it.  And if this is the phone you were just using, then it's almost definitely E-911 compatible.      However, if you are buying a phone from eBay, ask the seller for the ESN (electronic serial number) before bidding.  Then call Verizon at 800-922-0204 and ask them to make sure the ESN is ok for activation.  They'll check to make sure it's not on a lost/stolen phone list for you.  If the seller refuses to give you the esn, do NOT bid.  Any legitimate seller will give you the ESN, and any seller who doesn't, well, let's just say they don't want you checking the ESN for a reason.|`|Asb3yT3xaa	as long as it is digital, yes.

ogkhlNjPaa	Okay I worked as a tech with sprint for a long time and have worked with both of these company's products many times. I have done repair work, installed many programs, and got asked this question so many times. Both of the company's make good products and RIM (Blackberry) has really pulled it together and made some really impressive pda's. In the past RIM really were mainly just for e-mail. But the new "storm" is an awesome phone. It does all the funtions you mentioned at an impressive speed. I was not a huge fan of RIM until they cam out with the Storm. But if your not with the provider that has bought the rights to the phone I would go with the treo all the way. Palms technolgy is built well and has way more appilcations than RIM. There are over 10,000 diffrent games and applications that are compatable on handango.com alone. I just noticed that your with sprint, so go with the palm!!!! Its a good phone and does all the things your asking for, but the cool thing about it is that you can go to that website and pick diffrent navigation, streaming tv, and e-mail applications that you like. With the blackberry you only get the programs that sprint provides, which is probably going to be telenav for navigation. Telenav is a good program but there are so many out there that are much more user friendly and do alot more things.  Plus the voice reconigtion on telenav is not that great. For streaming tv your only going to get "sprint tv." Its okay as well but has a very limited seletion of channels compaerd to the programs on handango. When you think about it, your streming tv works off the internet so you should be able to get a large selection of channels but you really only get about 30 with sprint tv and it cost about $20 bucks a month. The palm can get way more if you go to 3rd party companys for your tv. Texting is pretty much the same with both, they both have a "qwerty" key pad. E-mails are the same too but as i said before with palm you can pick the program you want. Plus you can also add programs that would help you with work. For example, if your a carpenter you can get an application that could answer any question about your carpentry. Or if your a teacher there are things out there just for you, like dictionarys, and planners for your teaching plan. The blackberry is only going to work with whats already installed, which is a good program but there are soooo many more out there that can do live video messaging as well. Palm can work these applications, Blackberry cannot. If you like custom things then go with the Treo!!! Its a better phone due to the fact that you can pick what application programs you like. If your ok with "stock" programs go with the blackberry. Oh yeah the touch screen on the Treo is really cool to. Plus Treos dont completely crash like blackberrys do, well not as often. I got 20 blackberrys that completly crashed for every 1 treo and nothing could be recovered from the phone. So if you had not synced it recently you were screwed. Go with the treo.|`|sX8YVFrzaa	I have used both. I am not really a fan of windows mobile so I would go with the Curve. It has a great keyboard and is excellent for texting and emails. If I was you I would wait a few months a get the Palm Pre. Its going to be amazing!

Xaffu60Waa	How much what? Jailbreaking your iphone is free and something you do yourself, generally.     If you want to jailbreak your phone, I suggest you read up on this:     http://modmyi.com/wiki/index.php/State_o...    you might want to do some googling yourself, just if that link doesn't do it for you.     For Tmobile, I think that once you have jailbroken it, you download the Tmobile service package from Cydia (which is like the app store for unlocked iphones) and then pop in your Tmobile sim card.
T1OVh8EKaa	windows mobile might work, however linux is probably a more viable option.
OhTPygYlaa	You know that you need Outlook (not Outlook Express) on the PC and Visa to run WMDC. Next, which way are you syncing? Phone to PC or PC to phone. Contacts are in Outlook on the PC and in Contacts on the phone.  Hope that helps.
AA10687320	mediaconverter.org, just copy and paste a url from youtube and you got whatever song you want free.
H9zYhBeRaa	Hi  I have the same problem, I cant seem to play any sound off my surround sound but i can play it off the actual built-in tv speakers. Make sure you've plugged in the HDMI cable into the back of the television. Also have you tried turning up the volume on your TV to about 25 to 35? Otherwise check the back of your LG mini theater system for a HDMI port. if it does plug the HDMI cable into that instead.    Hope this Helps.
WbUrwR2Haa	i think that if u contact apple at 1800-MY-APPLE and give them the serial, then theyll be able to detect if someone trys to use it to their iTunes, maybe.    I understand how upset you must be but life goes on.    i would try contacting apple and giving them ur serial  , see what happens    absolute best of luck!
ctVhZMZXaa	Don't do it. I tried to do it to mine and it got all messed up and it never worked the same even after I restored it
SKkE3fK1aa	If you want portable DVD player, get the brand COBY!    If however you want a portable music player that plays video, i recommend getting a high-end phone instead of buying an iPod or whatever.     Example, I have the N96, I use that phone to CALL and TEXT people because that is what normal cellphones do. I listen to MUSIC and WATCH VIDEOS like movies or self-recorded memories because that is also what modern cellphones do. I take PICTURES and VIEW them later or have them PRINTED because the 5 MEGAPIXEL camera is quite good. I also edit WORD, POWERPOINT and EXCEL documents before I do something big because it's a smartphone not a cellphone. I also go to YOUTUBE because it has WiFi.|`|ySdKuMuVaa	Zen would be good has 6 hour video battery life. 2-16gb 4gb for $100 http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    San Disk Fuze 2-8gb  8gb. 8gb is $100 http://www.bestbuy.com/site/olspage.jsp?...    You might need to buy a video converter though.
fxXJZZRKaa	Yeah of course everything will actually be the same. Just go in a Metro PCS store and tell them what happened, they will sell you a new phone and put in your number under your name. It will cost you $79 plus tax. I don't think Metro charges for activation fees though. I doubt it you will be charged or that though.
tq5vKKWzaa	don't use iTunes
SKkE3fK1aa	Nope, the LG KU990 (Viewty) is not compatible with the 8GB card as well as any other microSDHC cards. I recommend using microSD cards instead of microSDHC ones, particularly the 2GB.    microSD (64mb - 2GB)  microSDHC (4GB - 32GB)    But microSDHC looks exactly like microSDHC the only difference is their internals.
T1OVh8EKaa	only way i know is to delete your whole library (not the files, just the itunes list) then reload it
RyvKws7Laa	At that size, just stick with 720p.  That's all you need to future proof a TV of that size.  Don't get caught up with 1080p, you won't notice it at that size.    I would try and get 120Hz refresh rate so that you can play back fast motion better (sports and action films).  Most are otherwise only 60Hz.  You can find really high end ones at 240Hz, but those will cost you a small fortune.    Also look at response times.  The smaller the better (5ms or small would be pretty solid).  8ms is okay, but not really that great.    Next, look at the contrast ratio.  Ignore any dynamic contrast ratio numbers (those are junk).  Look for true contrast ratios.  The bigger the better.    Lastly, you want to go and look at the TV in store.  Center yourself and be back approximately the same distance you would be at home.  Then walk to the left or right and keep going until the image becomes unviewable.  Then you know the viewing angle.  Then you can decide if its suitable for the room you want to put it in.|`|3NKQUIglaa	One good thing to look for is the atsc tuner, which picks up over the air hd signals. You just need an antena, but sometimes not depending on cable source.|`|5ALjkYEpaa	You can find good brand lcd TV which gives much better sound at Exspecto UK|`|b4nyOu7aaa	May you check on dvdcent's page: http://www.dvdcent.com/shop.php?k=lcd&c=...      Samsung LN32A650 32-Inch 1080p LCD HDTV with RED Touch of Color is the absolute best pick:    Bought 4 TV's this year for Xmas, this one was for myself. Needed a smaller TV and this one worked perfectly. Picture is excellent with Verizon FIOS and HD. Sound isn't the best but not bad. Better than the LN52A550. The touch of red is very suttle and when I ordered was a bit worried about it but is nice and can barely tell it is there unless you look with just the right lighting. Now I would prefer the touch of red if given the choice. Delivery took about a week with CEVA and had no issues. I set the TV up but they helped inspect it and will carry it wherever you want it. Setup is simple as well, just connect and auto scan. I also payed a bit more and ordered from Amazon versus the others since Amazon will let you return it if problems (30 days) and the others typically will not. Have had it for 1 1/2 months and is main TV in kids play room, watched daily. Great TV.    http://www.dvdcent.com/electronics-10658...
n4pNNcGfaa	Your wife should have been taught by her program how to handle these situations.      1.  Identify her dog as a service dog required because of her disability.  2.  Ask to speak to the manager if someone denies her access.  3.  Contact the owner or corporate headquarters if the manager doesn't resolve the issue.  4.  File a complaint with the Human Rights Commission, Attorney General's Office, or U.S. Department of Justice.  5.  Go to court.    Right now you're on step two:    Contact the manager of the store and ask about their service animal policy.  Offer some service animal educational materials, such as:    http://www.ada.gov/svcabrpt.pdf and the ADA information hotline operated by the U.S. Department of Justice: 1 - 800 - 514 - 0301    Better than 90% of the time this alone will solve the problem.  The manager will post the handout on the break room wall and have a little talk with the employees.  If it doesn't, you move on to step three and send a registered letter to the corporate headquarters.    Your wife's program should be willing to intervene at this point and do the education work or negotiation with corporate since this problem would affect all of their clients who wish to shop at Best Buy.    ----    Remember that if your wife is not disabled, if her dog is not trained to perform tasks to mitigate her disability, if she refused to answer what the dog is trained to do when asked, or if the dog was behaving inappropriately (disruptive, out of control, or dangerous) then the business has a legal right to refuse her dog entry.  If this is the case, they must still serve her the same as any other customer if she leaves her dog outside.|`|sfLSWEiMaa	Rather than type 3 pages Ill keep this short. There are several other answers to this very question that can also be viewed, search for "service dog"....     the DOJ enforces matters like this but try to resolve it yourself first if possible...    DOCUMENT EVERYTHING first... times, names, descriptions, exactly what was said....line your ducks up in a row....THEN, be very very firm with the stores manager at the time you call that you are upset about how you were treated and ask to speak to the general manager....write a formal complaint with ALL THE DETAILS so that the manager can address the employees that were involved....you can even ask for a written apology...IF the manager was involved, contact a regional manager....     IF you do NOT get the resolution to your satisfaction, contact the DOJ...      http://www.ada.gov/svcanimb.htm    good luck...|`|QNuW7ivyaa	Contact Best Buy customer Service.  Be respectful and inquiesative on their policies.  More than likely, there was a misunderstanding on the level of the employee at that particular store.  Customer service can address the issue and probably offer you a nice "apology" gift.  If they do not give you an answer you like, remind them that it is illegal to deny a service animal.  Make a claim, or formal complaint. Get a complaint number, and than contact your legal services.  (usually service dog foundations have people who specialize in this kind of thing and can help you very specifically).

Mine cost $500 and is 10 mega pixel, but there are cheaper ones to choose from with less mega pixels. Its small enough to fit in your pocket, but the screen is a decent size too. and it has a very good video camera option that lasts alot longer than usual digital cameras..so you can film your kids too :)  I highly recommend it. Hope it helps|`|8EmeNHyjaa	I suggest Sony Cybershot DSCW170/B 10.1MP with 5x Optical Zoom with Super Steady Shot.You can fire off three shots automatically at 1-second intervals (VGA standard mode) or 2-second intervals (full resolution mode) -- a great way to capture a childs first steps or a pets best tricks.http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012XZ...|`|e9f790d77a3b3a69de567374bd8e389aaa	thats the one problem with most point and shoots... they have lag  and when you start getting into the more expensive better ones, you might as well get the dslr looking ones that don't lag.

d381leKpaa	ummm a lot of ps3's freeze from time to time, but Sony has gotten slightly better at fixing that problem. But if you havn't gotten it yet, and you can wait, i would like to recommend to wait till April.   During April the PS3 will have a $100 price reduction, it is un-denied by Sony, but unconfirmed as well.|`|CJVuBAMqaa	No because it has more thing and more technology
