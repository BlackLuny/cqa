3kEzoBWzaa	There oil-absorbing sheets that you buy.

Olay also sells face wipes specifically for oily skin, plus they can be used as a makeup removes as well.

It doesn't hug as much as #3 & is beautiful, I would get rid of the straps and wear it like that!<br>  I don't like #1 because, well, I like traditional white dresses.. & I don't like #2 because I think the stitching looks bad around the waist area.

The reason I suggest that is that while these dresses all appear to be shapes that would flatter most body types, you never know how you'll feel in something until you try it on. <br>  <br>  The last thing you want is to find that "perfect" dress online, buy it, and then find it uncomfortable. It's in the summer in cyprus? These look like they may be heavy or hot in the weather. What about beading? I know a lot of beading can actually be itchy or painful to your arms. <br>  <br>  I think that your wedding dress is too special of a think to pick out based on what we all think. You should go have fun trying them on!|`|Ii0PpO8naa	Being that it's a summer wedding on the beach, I'd go with a thinner style like dress 3.  Although I also really like dress 2, dress 3 is light and summery and fits the beach wedding better.  And you have a good body to pull off a thinner dress like 3 as well.<br>  <br>  I'd love to get married on a beach! Congrats!|`|NRkmiftEaa	First off, congratulations! Getting married in the summer is really fun.<br>  <br>  I would deifnitely go with the third dress for the following reasons:<br>  <br>  The wedding is in the summer, by a beach. The other three dresses have full ballroom bottoms, and they all have tons of layers underneath. You're gonna die of a heat stroke in them. They're too hot especialy for a wedding outdoors, they may be more suitable inside a church (wit air conditioning) The third dress is perfect for a summer wedding. It doesnt have that much layers so you'll be cool, and it's a lot more beachy and outdoorish while the others are more dresses to wear if you're doing this in a church, etc.<br>  <br>  2nd reason. You're skinny, so you'll be able to pull of a dress that's a bit closer to your skin. It will define your curves very very very well. A person who's a little heavier might not be able to pull something off like this, consider yourself lucky.<br>  <br>  and third, this is a gorgoues dress. It's soo beautiful. It's simple, but yet sophisticated and classy.<br>  <br>  Trust me, go with the third one. It's the perfect dress for a wedding in the summer.<br>  <br>  All of them are beautiful dresses, but my least favorite is probably the last one. The layering of the dress is weird.|`|S22SYneBaa	Oh my gosh- the last dress is drop-dead gorgeous! I would wear it sleeveless, but thin straps would be cute too. I wish you the best of luck! (and if you don't pick that dress I might have to :)|`|NjGFiwahaa	i absolutley LOVEEEE the 4th one with your suggestions included!<br>  (the straps removed.)|`|iDXlG70Laa	awwww! you are so pretty! I think one or two! I cant decide! I dont like the last two because i dont think theyd be a very flattering dress for your shape! Dress one would be pretty on your skintone and hair and the rouching would look really great and I like the design of two a lot! You should close your eyes and picture yourself on your wedding day! Which one do you picture yourself wearing?

As long as you're wet enough (or have enough lube), your guy takes it slow, and you're not super tight, it'll be fine.<br>  <br>  And guys have no reason to be grossed out - the guy you're with should be mature about it.|`|9dNEw7etaa	Every girl will bleed the first time unless her hymen has already broken (this can happen from tampons, horseback riding, etc.). Any guy that cares is not a man and not worth your time.|`|kNzBfPMFaa	its all about a girls hymen. if it hasnt already broken in a sport or some other activity, then yes you probably will bleed. if the guy truly cares about you and loves you (which you need to make sure) then no, it shouldnt bother him. just tell him that he needs to be gentle and its your first time. you'll be fine =]|`|ZI6Wpb0paa	I had quite a lot of blood and I would recommend putting a towel under you because it can be messy.

It depends on if the     oris is torn or just seperated. I think that guys are mostly focuse on other things so don't even worry about that. You don't bleed that much.|`|c7ERXsGSaa	Some do, some don't.<br>  <br>  I didn't. But it hurt like a sonofabitch.<br>  <br>  And if they guy loves you enough, he won't care. (Which you should make sure of before you sleep with him.)
HhSjWXEQaa	I love converse. They're the only kind of sneakers I wear!<br>  I found neon ones at hot topic<br>  and sparkly ones at nordstroms..they're all over the place. Now I have over 20 pairs! <br>  And if you order them in low tops they're cheaper, and of course buying them in the store is cheaper, but you're more likely to find your size online.|`|4lqwMnhJaa	Zappos.com, Delias.com, and Piperlime.com all sell Converse. They would vary from $35-$50, depending on the style you want. Good luck :)|`|3kRnw3eNaa	Everywhere that sells brand name shoes sells Converse. [: I have three pairs. I got one doubled black and white ones from Champs for around $50. My black low tops from Shoe department around $35 and my gray ones I took from a friend. Lol.
ic7JdBYwaa	i have a really good site to answer that question<br>  <br>  i wanted to know the same so i went on this site and the hairstyles and cuts they advised actually suit me and it tells u whether a frindge would suit u or not!!!<br>  <br>  www.dailymakeover.com<br>  <br>  try it! it's totally worth it!|`|UyUZ8Uy6aa	heart<br>  or oval|`|4lqwMnhJaa	I can't tell what face shape you have from the side.

Good Luck :)|`|cAqMoc5Paa	ookok take a picture front on and not smiling then put a peice of paper against your computer screen and trace the shape of your face....<br>  <br>  basically faces can be square oval or round
456d68efa2a1d62c7af67d47f76d8bf0aa	Flickr is quite simply the best photo sharing site there is.  Miles better than anything else and a whole world better than Photobucket.  It is like a social networking site because you can add contacts, leave comments on other people's photos and they can leave comments on yours.  You can add favourites (other people's photos). It is sooo easy to upload photos that it's actually fun.<br>  <br>  You can also assign copyrights very easily.  Every photo you upload automatically comes in different sizes.  You can add notes onto any photo, other people can also add notes to your photo as shown in the link below (place your mouse over the photo to see them):<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaimelondonboy/3099187188/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaimelondon...</a><br>  <br>  I like it so much I bought a pro account back in 2005 and have been renewing it every year since.  Have got nearly 5,000 photos online (all my own photos).<br>  <br>  You can also upload photos directly from your mobile/cell phone - very handy if you are out on the move.  You can add videos. You can set permissions allowing certain people to view your private photos too.<br>  <br>  Feel free to add me as contact if you sign up. :]<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaimelondonboy/" rel="nofollow">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jaimelondon...</a>|`|UEw1OQ4gaa	Yeah, I have flickr.. its really good.. :)<br>  <br>  Pleasee answer mine :)<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqAMya_t89Rntq827COwTlXsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225153645AABL3wQ">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZdtKz9DMaa	I've used Flickr & Photobucket before and I have found that it is easier to upload several pictures at once on Photobucket. As long as you have access to the internet, you can access your pictures on both Flickr & Photobucket.|`|tjZUbRDeaa	I love Flickr. All the pictures are so professional and it's a great website.<br>  I can reach it from my computer.<br>  I can upload pictures from it to my myspace if I save it to my desktop first.
b2cfc65d6cd40511b003b66405c2fc86aa	There is no such thing as "Asian hair". Asian people have hair that differs just as much as everyone else.<br>  <br>  Some Asian people have straight, thin hair and others have wavier hair with more body... it all really depends upon the person. However, it is extremely rare for an Asian person to have really curly hair.|`|dNL4n2oGaa	Straight is...<br>  I think that is Asian hair so yeah..
gPYTkIW2aa	A lot! Like a mother-effer (but I guess it depends on your pain tolerance)<br>  bring your own ice to numb it.|`|st5reHVjaa	yes u can swim by may.<br>  it doesnt hurt that much.<br>  and if u have a little flab it doesnt hurt that much either.<br>  it hurts more then ur ears but not as much as ur cartilage. (my cartilage stayed red for a loong time)<br>  but dont get double belly button piercings, thats nasty.|`|Kb0p6mcJaa	it doesnt hurt atall.<br>  & yu can swim, just put vasaliene on it.<br>  & clean it good when yu get out.|`|JhjzzHXpaa	If your getting your belly button pierce by a seasoned professional, it should only feel like a small pinch & then it's sore for about a week or two.<br>  <br>  & of course you'd be able to swim by May.  A piercing is basically like getting a really small wound.  It's all in how you take care of it.  I've seen some girls have the worst outcomes of belly button rings because they didn't clean it daily.  <br>  If you decide to, make sure you go to a piercer that you feel comfortable with & has a lot of experience.  Kind of like finding a OBGYN. haha.|`|dV6E3sHMaa	no not at all.<br>  it just feels like a little pinch.<br>  and yes you can swim by may u can swim by the end of april.<br>  i got mine done in june and i was swimming a week later and i was fine.|`|FoxTcv4Zaa	worse than pregnancy|`|2fYyw4LBaa	Bellybutton piercing feels like getting a shot, its a pinch for like 2 seconds. It's not bad at all. But I've heard people passing out and s**t so I guess its all on how high your pain tolerance is. And they tell you not to go swimming, or be submerged in water until your piercing is completely healed... so if you dont have any complications with it you might be ok to go swimming...|`|MFTeow5laa	um well it depends where you get your belly button pierced. the place i got mine, first they but in a skinny needle through, then a thicker one and they keep putting thicker ones through until its the right size. its hurts. a lot. for like two months.|`|S9SC4yJQaa	It hurts of course but its not too bad. You can definitely swim by may. Keep in mind when you first get it pierced it hurts to lay on your stomach and it hurts if anyone touches it!|`|2ec3c76fd8030a72563cfb9a02cf55e2aa	It won't hurt much, and any pain or discomfort will only be temporary.  It should take about 6 weeks to heal, if you take care of it properly.|`|1h5RpINNaa	It doesn't hurt at all.  I hurts less than the ears, and way less than pulling off a band-aid.  It should be healed by May for swimming.|`|EQXy6WTxaa	My friend got it pierced, and it got infected, and then it closed and looked odd.|`|M71hN9OBaa	it doesnt hurt at all.<br>  <br>  and yes you can swim by may.|`|0w9tY32uaa	it just stings, like getting your ears pierced.|`|m0dmwCmFaa	lol, i have mine done and it reall doesnt hurt at all. when they clamp it it basically numbs it i guess you can say. they did the same with my tongue. so no worries there.. and your really not suppose to swim till its healed. but i did i live by the beach so i guess the salt water helped it heal and plus when you clean it you get starlized salt water. (:|`|iv5ZnTA2aa	mine didnt hurt at all! :)<br>  the day i got it i was chatting on loads to myself when i got into the store like OMG THIS IS GONA HURT BLAHBLAH but then he was like "look up for a sec" and i was still talking.. then he just did it! i was like wow that was so fast. its really quick nothing at all to worry bout! mine took 5 months to heal though, so it can take anything from a month to a year, its different for different people. you will know when it is healed, if it isnt healed when you move it , it will really hurt and it will keep scabbing up and drying up. if it is healed it will never dry up or scab and it will move around easily. hope u get it done! xx|`|QWfkHyUeaa	less then getting your ears pierced. and they heal pretty fast... it doesn't hurt much at all.... i got mine when i was 16 years ago and i was stressing and i remember saying what is it all ready done to the tattooist that did it...  you should be fine to swim.... it's only a piercing.. if it got irratated or itchy then stop but i was a fast heeler and i was back at the pools like within a week.. i just made sure afterwards i used the cleaning stuff and soaked the area in it when i got home, i was fine|`|IWDYKQBgaa	umm idk if you will be able to swim but i know it doesn't hurt that bad my mom got it done. but be careful they break a lot unlass you get the expensive ones.|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	It doesn't hurt at all! ( that's MY opinion.)<br>  & nooo, you have to wait a bit longer to go swimming, it takes about 6 months to a year to fully heal.<br>  Good luck (:|`|JxXCbm0daa	If your worried about it hurting than you ovbviously shouldnt get it pierced.
Gk4kNAWsaa	THIS IS NO JOKE...<br>  <br>  if i had already taken a shower (12 to 15 minutes) it only take me about 15 minutes to get ready! (i only wear eye make up and have real long brown hair that i never blow dry...i just pin it up or let it hang down long and let it dry on it's own) <br>  <br>   i have never understood why some women take 1-2 hours or more to get ready. 30 minutes would totally be pushing it!!!<br>  <br>  smiles from little miss plain and simple,<br>  rachelle|`|Ao5aSAWiaa	Evening of what? Something important, a lot of time, like a good hour plus to do hair and all aha. But just for some fun with my friends, maybe a half hour to throw on some clothes and eyeliner while shoving a last minute meal down my throat.|`|5jsMY4RIaa	no more than an hour. an hour and a half if I take a shower.|`|216d90e6aa749da6fe51585ee054ef87aa	About an hour.

But I take like 15 minute showers--or longer, lol. And I take my time putting on lotion, making sure I pay extra attention to my body so its nice and smooth and soft. And I don't leave the house until I feel my outfit is complete. I guess Im high maintenance, but Im also very slow because I dont like to rush. Especially in the morning...& plus, Im always late lol so it really doesnt matter.
9oMXpS05aa	you need a molding spray. it'll hold your hair exactly where you want it. try got2b glued (i think that's the name of it).. the bottle looks like a yellow fire extinguisher.|`|qbnrzyCZaa	Get your hair wet (like right after you take a shower) then use some gel to get your hair nice and sticky to stay and put your hair in those directions when it's finally in the position you want it to be and put hair spray (I'm talking lots!) then your hair won't become flat through out the day. Good Luck :)
qTs5uNP5aa	Heres a cute outfit:<br>  <br>  Hair: Ponytail with little curl on the bangs!

If you do, really just cute sneakers are fine. But not DCs or anything. I mean like tight sneakers like rocket dog or converse or something like that. Graphic tees from Delias, or Forever 21 are great for that kind of thing. They have sayings and stuff like flowers, too. Good luck!|`|jo7n4Olaaa	Try a nice top.

WpgEqGrvaa	I think the last 2 as opposed to the first picture of the bangs you want.<br>  The first is very heavy and your face seems quite 'soft'. <br>  The second two are more gentle.

Similarly, if you don't like it once it's done it won't be so hard to grow it out :D|`|h4hSJzdcaa	the second would look better on you

bOLShuCuaa	um...........i think you should get your bangs to your eyes and comb them to a diagonal. then i think you should get 3 layers. one a little under your ear, another to your chin, and another to your shoulders. curl your hair out right after you wake up.  then you will a cute due|`|DGDhQBwpaa	you look really young, i would just leave it at one length for now. or maybe you could get side bangs, that would look nice too. it would probaly make you look older, too.|`|SYPeab1Raa	Dont pull it back on the top and curl the sides.  Thats a celeberty style.  If you dont want to do that, cut your hair down to your shoulder, and get bangs.  Straighten your hair.
AA11101361	It depends on how light/dark you are currently.  An African American friend of mine who is light skinned gets spray tans from time to time.  Since the spay tan is just about as dark as she is, it gives her a really nice glow.  Try it out and see how it looks.|`|D1c8cRM4aa	You want to be darker??|`|SYPeab1Raa	It depends on the brand. Sometimes it will make you look mexican.  Most times it will make you look darker.  And sometimes it has no efffect at all.|`|QrJme3hdaa	Is this to make your skin even?  If yes, just use the Jergens Glow for face or legs.|`|VbeDUoIsaa	i'm guessing it wouldn't show....why would you want to get a tan if you're already dark?

QC9DNd4Qaa	Its made by Paul mitchell. I believe its called break away. You have to be licensed to buy it. But it takes away all oxidized color. If you cant use that then wash  your hair in heavy detergent like laundrty soap. It opens the cuticle layer of the hair and takes out color. Be sure to condition it cuz its going to feel very dry.

They would be the most logical if you don't want to be towering over everyone else, and probably the most comfy for dancing etc.<br>  <br>  Though if you did want a bit of glamour to your footwear, how about a pair of kitten heels?

Apb0xkPAaa	your not fat but i do know what you mean..<br>  go to the gym.. work on your stomach..<br>  and then do some cardio to burn of side fat [ex: running, bicycling]|`|piy8iGGnaa	NO. You are NOT fat. You look great for your height. And you are actually at a great weight for you height. I'm 5'3 and 125 pounds. And I think I Look fabulous. All you need to do is workout to stay in shape and tone up. I personally don't like being on the skinny side. Maybe cuz I'm cuban. I like having curves. Just no gut, love handles or flabby thighs. Just work out 3-4 times a week. Try doing 60 squads 3-4 x a week for your legs so they look toned. Do about 100 abs 3 times a week and some sort of cardio to burn the fat. My personal favorites are Squads. Gives your buns a nice lifted look and bicyclee. I do 3 miles 3 times a week. I have an Ab-Slide and it works out my abs, arms and back. You really don't need to kill yourself. You just need toning. Do it with your friends and its more fun.|`|c0502c253957f058b987a53469f45229aa	You do not look fat!  I know what it's like to have no idea what you look like and to just want someone to be honest with you!  You have great legs, and they look like they will always be thin.  Most people don't have ankles like you.  Take advantage of your legs.  Play a sport you like.  Don't worry about cardio since you don't need to lose weight, but do some lunges, squats and calf-lifts.  Self magazine always has good exercises you can do.  Don't think about calories but pay attention to what makes you bloated.  drink water and stay away from too much sugar and white flour.  <br>  I'm 5'5" and 135-140, not overweight but heavier than people would guess.  I have boobs and muscle--and no complaints from me or boyfriends!|`|Bhe23EGjaa	my goodness darlin'!!!! you are not in the least bit fat. but i totally understand how you are feeling. i recently gained weight, my doctor said that i am in the correct weight range for my height, but i am used to being smaller. i started walking, which is a nice way to get light excercise and fresh air. it really helps me feel better about myself.|`|SiVQHx9Caa	hey hey <br>  no no no u do not look fat at all.....youve got a gorgous curvy figure im seriously underweight i wish i was lyk you....many of my friends think there fat and there not is called CURVES and unless your a man your suppost ta have them....haha....<br>  well maybe if you want to keep tonned i was told by a friend that doing 30 sit ups a night before bed everyday 4 a week that she noticed a diff nd shes got a flat stomach so maybe you would feel better if you noticed a diff yourself<br>  hope i helped<br>  YOUR NOT FAT :D|`|c84425896dcf011d7ce55b0c848251c7aa	you think you're fat? honey please! not even a little.<br>  <br>  if you don't really like your body type tough, some great ways to feel better about yourself are light dieting and exercising.<br>  Start going for a run.

ibtLgY5Xaa	Obviously babies.|`|O8oiLvPWaa	No, baby oil is not made from babies, but here are the ingredients of a few brands listed below. <br>  <br>  I remember when baby oil that was available at the supermarket was 100% mineral oil, packaged differently and sold at a slightly higher cost. People sometimes bought plain mineral oil from the pharmacy or used petroleum jelly instead. Then, with industrial progress, other ingredients began to be added to the baby oils <br>  <br>  Now, back on the farm, people sometimes used herbal remedies for diaper rash and dry skin. If nothing else was available, they even used lard. <br>  <br>  In some countries, whale oil is used.<br>  <br>  That reminds me that honey and sugar were used on the farm to heal wounds. Honey is hydroscopic, meaning it attracts water or moisture and helps to seal a wouind. Many honeys are 80% sugar and 20% water. Honey is also antiseptic, killing bacteria. This leads me to think that honey was probably used at times to treat diaper rash. <br>  <br>  All this reminds me to say that putting butter on a burn does no good at all and may do harm. For a burn, put ice on it or it will burn all the way to the bone. Then maybe honey could help it heal, but ask your doctor!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Soft and Silk Baby Oil <br>  Ingredients: Mineral Oil, Aloe Vera Extract, Vitamin E, Acetate, Fragrance. <br>  <br>  Johnson's Baby Oil, Lavender scent <br>  Ingredients: Mineral Oil, Fragrance <br>  <br>  Burt's Bee Baby Bee Oil <br>  Ingredients: prunus armeniaca (apricot) kernel oil, vitis vinifera (grape) seed oil, tritium vulgare (wheat) germ oil, tocopheryl acetate, fragrance, tocopherol, rosmarinus officinalis (rosemary) leaf extract, glycine soja (soybean) oil, canola oil <br>  <br>  Buddha Baby Oil <br>  Ingredients Prunus amygadulas dulcis (sweet almond) oil and Lavendula augustofolia (lavender) oil.<br>  <br>  Baby Moon Oil<br>  Ingredients: Lavender, tangerine and "other" essential oils, in sweet almond and olive oils.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  ....or it could be made from babies....  :/|`|qZPZ2bTpaa	The ingredients are on the back of the bottle.

It's not edible (except as a 'laxative' as pure mineral oil) but it does make one 'feel baby soft' when smoothed onto the body or used in the tub.  It's basically a 'moisturizer' for the outer skin.  Vegetable oil, corn oil, the different kinds of olive oil and most other 'oils' are used in cooking and meal preparation.  Olive oil is also used to 'moisturize' both the hair and the body as well as a cooking oil.|`|AcARmgG1aa	according to your theory. <br>  <br>  babies..|`|5KdXVKrJaa	baby<br>  jk that would be horrible<br>  good question <br>  lol|`|dcd11iUwaa	a by product from the petro-chemical industry|`|u6HndVxaaa	oil and babies|`|yje6VNCpaa	ohhh. crap. i never thought about that.

eEznnpnVaa	Your tissue in general has been damaged by your piercing [that is inherent with a piercing], what you're describing sounds like the typical pain that follows tongue piercings. I would be concerned if the swelling didn't reduce significantly after a week. <br>  <br>  You can't see the nerves in your tongue...or anywhere for that matter. You're probably looking at that big blue vein--your lingual artery on the underside of your tongue. <br>  <br>  I think you're fine, but I would get your piercer's opinion.|`|Lqdi9Xswaa	that doesn't sound good, but i've never had my tongue pierced so i'm not sure if it is normal. call the person who pierced it and ask them what they think.|`|eN5xA6RKaa	it sounds normal to me. my tongue swelled up for awhile after i got mine done and it hurt when i moved it too, if its still swollen and sore after another week then go back to the piercer and see what he says. and for it being off center on the bottom, thats fine, he or she pierced it that way to avoid hitting your blue vein in your tongue. people wont notice it because its on the bottom anyways. if you have nerve damage you wouldnt be able to move your tongue, taste, and your tongue would be numb..and since your feeling pain its not numb..because when something is truely numb you cant feal pain.|`|SW6fButzaa	We have very recently and now it is normal to have these problems, for now you have to do is cuidartelo and stay calm if you want to go that you pierce your consideration, and in any case in 15-20 days if you still bothering well then you must if you go to see because it is not so normal.|`|OqD4Z6wpaa	wow i have not heard of that happening and it didnt happen to me. it could just be healing and it feels weird. but if its really bothering you, go to your piercer and have them look at it just to be sure. the piercer might have hit a nerve, and if they did then they should re pierce it for free|`|7tRTZhnLaa	Um yeah about what that other girl said about going back and having the person redo it... don't listen to them. If the piercer messed up the piercing the first time, it's probably not the best idea to have them do it again. Go see a doctor.|`|icUCVqn6aa	no i think ur fine i have my toung done to and my lasted for two weeks and it was swallon with a ring around my toung that was like yellow and purple but i was fine ti was healing i would worry when it dont go away and turn black|`|BAPj9JW3aa	hmmm i'm really not sure ....maybe you're just being paranoid?<br>  <br>  if you're that concerned about it, go back to the person who pierced you or go see a doctor.
yIfaACw5aa	Triangular, spaghetti-strap tops are better suited to women with small busts. Bikini tops with soft padding can add curves and confidence, providing a lift for small breasts. For petite frames, string ties on tops and bottoms give the appearance of width. <br>  A frill and detail can make you look curvy.<br>  <br>  eg:<br>  <a href="http://www.newlook.co.uk/1619550/161955041/ProductDetails.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.newlook.co.uk/1619550/1619550...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?beginIndex=0&viewAllFlag=&catalogId=20552&storeId=12552&categoryId=105430&parent_category_rn=51608&productId=893049&langId=-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.dorothyperkins.com/webapp/wcs...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.monsoon.co.uk/invt/49710441&bklist=icat,5,shop,accessorize,accessorizeswimwear,swimbikinitops" rel="nofollow">http://www.monsoon.co.uk/invt/49710441&b...</a>|`|KWl605JTaa	yes ruffles tube top!<br>  go to delias.com|`|9sHJz788aa	Go for one that doesn't show to much cleavage, then get nice tight bottoms.

KmwrfHPtaa	It stings, and after it will be an achy pain. It doesn't last long though -but be careful to control allergies and do what you can to avoid getting a cold. Healing becomes much harder when your nose is runny!<br>  <br>  The secret to a pain-free (or less pain, anyway!) is to 1. Do NOT anticipate what it will feel like or how much pain there will be. Speaking from experience you do not want to focus on it. 2. Think of something else. The whole fluffy clouds and kittens thing doesn't work for me, so I think about finances or something.Thinking about bills works for me! 3. Treat it like it's not a big deal -because it really isn't. Go in there and assume that it's going to be super quick and casual.<br>  <br>  It's not about trying to trick yourself (you can't) but it is about convincing yourself that it's alllll good. Find a reputable piercer and don't let anyone near you with a piercing gun!|`|O5nCKpwcaa	It stings and your eyes will water but it is not as sore as you think it would be and if you get it done with a gun, its way quicker. Will throb a bit after but wouldn stop me from gettin it done .I've had it done twice as once I let it close up. Good luck with it. Hope you like it.!|`|xXMUyCalaa	it HURTS dont let nooone lie to u it stings when they put the needle through it takes a lil while to heal tho but while healin it dont really hurt|`|GvuMyMFOaa	It hurts enough to make your eyes water, but if it's done quickly and properly the pain will go away within a minute or two and then there will be a dull ache for a while.
AA11614812	if ur talking about like a vampire kiss..(which i have) its fairly easy to take care of.<br>  <br>  make sure u dont get hair product into it.  wash the area with antibacterial soap about 3x a day and make sure while its still healing (about 4-6 weeks) to have clean hands when u touch it so it doesnt get infected.|`|3a72ae0c30ef90de390ceb62b46fb44aaa	I'm not a big fan of the surface piercings.  They seem like a big waste of money for something that will grow out in a few months.<br>  <br>  I would think though, that if you get the back of the neck done, it would not be very easy to take care of and you will probably have to have someone else clean it unless you are a contortionist. Won't your clothes get caught on it?  If you have long hair, you're going to have to keep it away and really clean until it heals because of the dirt and grease that collect in your hair.|`|IKq25y8faa	a bunch of people i know have their neck pierced. it looks cool but my neighbor got it infected, it was sooo disgusting, it turned green and like weird liquidy stuff would ooze out.

YmYupQyGaa	If your parents are dead set against it,do you reckon piercing it yourself will convince them they're wrong?<br>  No,and they'll probably make you take it out.<br>  Great idea.|`|AA11940634	If you can't find rubbing alcohol, where'd you find a hypodermic needle to do the piercing? Has it been sterilized by an autoclave? Do you know where the place is on YOUR nose where you won't damage veins?<br>  By the way, if your parents don't want you to have it, do you think they'll let you keep it if you do it yourself? You're kinda proving you're irresponsible.|`|e9gsf1GJaa	my parents are the same way.<br>  1) Rubbing alcohol and Hydrogen peroxide are way too strong to be using on a fresh piercing, they will kill the new skin cells your body needs to form in order to create scar tissue and will slow down healing. <br>  2) Polysporin and Neosporin are petroleum based products which your body cannot break down. They create a waterproof seal over the piercing which traps bacteria inside the piercing. <br>  <br>  <br>  OH! and its easier to get a septum piercing,<br>  cause you could hide it by buying the retainer<br>  I RECOMMEND IT!|`|AA10849332	rubbing alcohol....can be found at any drug store, wal-mart, grocery store....sometimes even gas stations carry it.<br>  <br>  but what is the point of doing something like that behind your parents' back?

Try to show your teeth a little more to make your smile a little bigger.

It may sound absurd at first but it contains the same active ingredient found in 90% of most over the counter teeth whiteners such as Crest. Every time before you brush your teeth just swish it like mouth rinse and in a matter of 1-2 weeks you'll notice a good difference. For those who are skeptic, try it and you'll find out it tastes exactly like the teeth whitening material.<br>  <br>  Goodluck|`|ObmLjqYMaa	If you used any of the Pearl Drops range, <a href="http://www.pearldrops.co.uk/productrange.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.pearldrops.co.uk/productrange...</a> should sort out any discolouring of the teeth. <br>  Also to soften lips and remove any dry skin, just begin by using a clean unused toothbrush and apply a dab or two of petroleum jelly to it. Brush lips until dead skin is scrubbed off and rinse with warm water. <br>  Then if you get some cinnamon oil and dab on lips before you put on your lipstick, should plump your lips making them look bigger and fuller.<br>  This all should help make your smile look that bit better!|`|B3H7HIFGaa	Really, i don't believe in trying to improve looks. Just how you feel about yourself. If you train yourself to honesly believe you look amazing without changing anything about yourself now, then it won't matter.<br>  <br>  You're smile is nice.

DHJAiHMNaa	A foundation brush will give you a nice coverage without wasting product.  The sponge just wastes product.  Your hands work well, but the coverage may not be as uniform all over.<br>  <br>  Try Target.  The Sonia Kashuk (sp?) line has a nearly identical brush to the Bobbi Brown foundation brush for 1/3 the price-$15.  If you keep it clean with baby hair wash (about once a week), it will last you a long time.|`|s4psKJrPaa	i dont think you can, it would get all weird.<br>  <br>  mine please!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgsDsPWyyqxOFGIKF4PzYEbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226134211AA5CraE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|e6nfGN37aa	idk|`|qroOTyrGaa	Brushes give you a more even finish by blending more and don't tug on the skin which can irritate it. I actually really love the Body Shop foundation brush. Just a warning: brushes can be a bit more high maintenance as you need to clean them more. I wash mine ever 2 days. I take baby soap and put a bunch in the palm of my hand, then I wet the brush with super hot water and I swish the brush around in my palm, rinse it and repeat those two steps until it's completely clean. If you don't clean it, it could develop bacteria and make you break out. <br>  Good luck!!|`|dhN3srQbaa	try MAC's 187 brush. its a stippling brush and you stiple it on your face then blend. it gives a natural/flawless airbrushed look also makeup sponges are filled with bacteria not with a brush that can be easliy washed and also brushes last longer(well high quality ones do) and sponges yo have to keep buying watsing money. The brush costs $42 USD but trust me its worth it I had mine for 5 years and it hasnt shed at all and looks brand new.|`|i8cR16z0aa	You could use any eyeshadow brush like the one here : <a href="http://www.mandee.com/nshop/product.php?view=detail&groupName=perfume&productid[]=MD-M08812085581000&startColor[]=&dept=&sale=" rel="nofollow">http://www.mandee.com/nshop/product.php?...</a> it is the long brush on the right.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	brush for liquid, probably not stick with the sponge
iSBl5MYgaa	Infusium 23 leave in treatment is very good for the hair. washing hair everyday is not good unless you have oily hair. too much of anything is bad.Iam trying to grow my hair so i do some hot oil treatments, i have curly hair but when i straighten it with flatiron i leave is like that for about a week. you hair has natural healthy oils. It wouldnt hurt to go to Toni & Guy once in a while to do a special hot peppermint hair mask or just a mega protein conditioning.And they say changing your shampoo and conditioner here and there,which is good to have 2 or three kinds to choose from.

xT024KMsaa	I love stilletto. It adds a lot of length, but not a lot of thickness- which I like as my lashes are thick, but short.|`|GItWq2mGaa	Pros:<br>  <br>      *  It doesnât clump<br>      *  It builds decent length<br>      * The wand is easy to use<br>      * Cute packaging and itâs shaped like a stiletto!<br>  <br>  Cons:<br>  <br>      * No patent finish<br>      * Smells worse than Colossal<br>      * Falls short in the volume and curl department<br>  <br>  Verdict:<br>  I give this mascara 3 1/2 out of 5 stars.  It isnât terrible, but it wonât become a âfavoriteâ either. If you want a very natural look and only need to add length to your lashes then youâll love it.  I prefer an almost fake lash effect so I prefer CoverGirl Lash Blast and Maybelline Colossal because they give more volume and curl.|`|VMEKBGUjaa	I really liked it!

I think you're very pretty already|`|AA10067860	your a really pretty girl so you won't have to do much at all. first off, once and a while if you want to you could straighten your hair. and on the days you want to keep it curly i would put sun silk gel in it because it will tone down the frizz. you could also wear some mascara, a little eyeliner(if you want)  and a pale rosy blush(but not to much) and some light pink shimmery lip gloss. since you have sweatshirt on in your picture im not sure if that means you wear the, often but if you do then you should change it around and wear colors like blue,green,pink and other brighter colors, trust me they will look nice. if you want i can make you some outfits and put them together for you on polyvore(if you don't know what that is its just a website were you can make outfits for people ha ha) so out it in the details and let me know! good luck(:<br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  okay i'll make some for you but where do you shop nad like whats your style or a style do you like?

YwHl37Hgaa	Try lavender oil. Apply this oil on the back acne everyday for minimum 15 days or else apply fresh Aloe vera juice or the gel and wash after a few hours. When washing your back use a loofah, sponge or exfoliant to help remove any dead skin cells that may clog up pores. Use a gentle action and donât be too harsh otherwise you will end up breaking the skin. You should probably change your shirt twice a day to avoid bacteria buildup.

IpFb0LWmaa	I believe tanning lotion magnifies the sun's rays, so it speeds up the tanning process. They make tanning even more harmful, and just because you use tanning lotion doesn't necessarily mean you'll tan. I've never had any success with tanning lotion.. I'm pale and only get burnt when I use it.<br>  <br>  The only non-harmful kinds of tanning lotion are sunless ones - Aveeno and Vaseline both make good sunless tanning moisturizers that give you a gradual tan over a bunch of applications. But it takes a long time if you're looking to do your entire body!|`|U6CPWDqgaa	Tanning lotion really does work. getting really any lotion dont get the tanner because that makes your legs and arms really dark but it you got a really light color you could still see it. for a natural look get a meduim tanning lotion and put it on every day for about a week.|`|DGDhQBwpaa	no tanning lotion is going to be harmful.

lIpjuMTHaa	The Neutrogena foaming self tanner works really well. And it doesn't streak or look orange easily. What I do is I shave and loofah, and then i mix some of the foam with a little bit of regular lotion and then apply it. That seems to work the best, then have someone like a mom or friend check for streaking.|`|Q7kNtNSRaa	I dont know coz i dont use tanners|`|vV77Pv1vaa	first of all, thanks for being so smart about your skin.<br>  <br>  i feel the nutregina one, its a double bottle, ...connected as one, one side squeezes out white lotion,the other too, but combined they work nice.

kUE3Ddktaa	You know how your brain can tune out background noise, like a fan or music or a dripping faucet?<br>  <br>  It does the same thing with scent. When you are exposed to any sensation for a long enough period of time, your brain basically starts to ignore it so that you can concentrate on other things. The scent is still there - if someone walks up to you, they will smell the fragrance because it's "new" to their brain. But if they sit with you long enough, their brain will tune it out, too.<br>  <br>  If people are telling you that your fragrance is strong, that's a nice way of saying "Eww, you're wearing too much cologne." Just put on a little bit. You may not be able to smell it, but other people will.|`|e6nfGN37aa	becuz u get used to the smell and dont notice it anymore or its a cheap perfume!!|`|8ENRWmoMaa	one of your bodies defense mechinisms is that it ignores smell after a while of being around them.  hence how bum's dont pass out from their own smell, and garbage man can work at the dumb sights and not wannna die.|`|8ae38a2ac6a77dd4a25ba0e15d91e256aa	because chemo receptors stop signaling the brain once you've been exposed for a fragrance for a period of time. yes, others should still be able to smell it.|`|FIOUkBpHaa	It's because you're around the scent so often that your nose has gotten too used to it and doesn't even register it most of the time.<br>  <br>  And you should probably wear a little less, too.|`|yPPO4YnRaa	you get used to it being there after a while, so you don't notice it anymore.|`|3XABixiQaa	you cannot smell the fragrance that u wear sometimes becuz u get use to it during the day.. other ppl can smell it tho.. its just like if you walk into someone elses house u can smell the scent of their house but they cant becuz thats wear they live and spend most of their dayy.. dont over do the fragrance...

f8oGNBtCaa	This is a tough one. I don't think there is really anything you can do in ball gowns. So my best suggestion is make it a girls day out like a spa day, getting your hair/nails and stuff. Then just dress up in your dresses and take pictures, change out of your fancy stuff into casual stuff and go out to a fancy restaurant... therefore your hair won't look too done.<br>  <br>  If that's too expensive to do, pick a friend who has a nice basement of their own and throw your own mini prom, only difference is you won't have to pay your school to hang out in their basement.<br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!|`|a4Tij3Xnaa	Find someone with a big back yard or large family room and have your own Ball. Get some Japanese Lanterns, lots of Christmas lights in white, tables and chairs (borrow them from church) get plastic table cloths from dollar store party supply and paper plates,etc. to match. Have everyone bring two snacks, chips and dip, finger sandwiches, cookies and punch made with seven-up, frozen juice constrate and crushed strawberries, with slice very thin, oranges.

Like, go bowling (all night or cosmic).<br>  If you have an age appropriate dance club, go there.<br>  Go to an all night diner.<br>  Go to the movies.<br>  Use the money and create your own fun party, it'll be TONS cheaper and you can have your own music and snacks.|`|0L1HVgiXaa	Go bowling. My brother and his fiance did that and it was funny to watch them try to bowl all dressed up and it might be a good way to have fun with your friends.|`|aLGe7JZEaa	Go out to a restaurant like Friday's.

EYqTV2EYaa	It varies. Usually, it's 5'5"-5'8"+.|`|6YYJHdQ2aa	i was watching Americas Next Top Model and they said 5'9 is really short to be a model so If you wanna meet Tyra Banks standards I suggest over 5'9!!!!|`|afX9FlaEaa	to whoever said 5'5 AHAH<br>  <br>  5'8 love and up any shorter and no...dont believe me just look at all the models however if you want to be a non fashion model and do catalouges....5'6 and up <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.newmodels.com/height.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.newmodels.com/height.html</a><br>  <br>  Letâs look at some numbers.  A study done in 2002 showed that among top editorial fashion agencies in Los Angeles and New York, 81% of their âeditorial fashionâ models were 5â9â and above; 15% were between 5â8â and 5â9â, and only 4% were below 5â8â tall.<br>  <br>  According to the US Center for Health Statistics, only about 3 ?% of all young women are within an inch of 5â10â in height.  The average weight for those women is about 145-150 pounds â some 30+ pounds more than the ânormalâ fashion model.  If you add in factors like facial beauty, body proportions and all the other things that qualify a girl to apply as a âfashion modelâ the competition is a very small part of the population.<br>  <br>  By comparison, almost 20% of all young women are within an inch of 5â6â.  So when you couple the strong desire of the fashion industry for tall women with the fact that a short girl has 5-6 times the number of competitors, the chances look very small indeed.<br>  <br>  <br>  If your taller youll be more succesfull...gisele is 5 10|`|vRZolfOraa	Well the minimum height (I think!) for catalogue modelling is about 5ft 7inches, and about 5ft 9 for catwalk modelling.<br>  <br>  However you are still only 13 so it is likely that you will grow a bit more before puberty is over. If you are serious about modelling, and be careful because it is a hard industry to work in, then talk to a career's advisor (if you have one in school) and then maybe ring a reputable agent for an informal chat to get more information on what type of modelling is available and what the requirements are.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps<br>  xxx|`|NRkmiftEaa	5'5 is too short to be a model. I'm 5'7 and i barely made the cut. Most agencies want girls from age 14-18 to be at least 5'7 and girls from 19-23 to be 5'9. At least my agency does (ford) I suggest waiting a bit and see if you grow any taller. If you do reach 5'7 and is under 110 lbs. consider it.|`|y8LnEPxPaa	i think short ppl can still b models but if ur not very nice looking u cant get a modelin job so easy i want 2 b a model 2 it sounds awesum|`|Deb4iqbvaa	Normally you have to be over 5'8" to do runway, but you could do commercial too (that's things like catalogs and sale ads as well as actual commercials).

Em00pBjTaa	i love old navy. i'm fifteen and i shop there all the time. they have some old lady stuff, but a lot of the clothes are super cute.<br>  and reallly cheap usually.

I've been to old navy before.. people judge their clothing on basically like how no one really wears it.

Also if it is a religious high school then there is your answer.<br>  <br>  If it's none of the above your school is stupid and you should protest. But you know, one can actually say that it does affect learning in the same way not wearing uniforms does. People will be focused on how good or horrible your makeup look. Students might touch up in class. If the makeup runs it can get all over papers, desks, and walls costing the school money; Also the school wants you to focus on learning not on picking up people off the opposite sex or seeiing who has the best and worst makeup.|`|FHui30aeaa	It is not a big deal.  Plenty of decent schools do not let you wear make-up. and I think you need to concentrate on your school work..  I do not how old you are but it is AFFECTING AND ALLOWED.   Not effecting and aloud.  OMG  worry about your learning and not the   make up.|`|dhN3srQbaa	Honestly I have no idea why at my school they're strict about uniforms but not makeup. makeup wont do any harm i guess because theres some girls that put makeup in school and go to bathrooms fixing it and etc. maybe they think its a distraction? i don't why its completely retarded.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	I don't know natural beauty, thank god my school isn't like that but it is stupid it doesn't distract

7Es1LjvHaa	Depending on the sensitivity of your skin if you have bought the relevant facewash/cleanser, then, firstly, splash your face with lukewam water as this opens up your pores. Then apply a small amount of product into your hands and lather up. Start by gently placing your fingertips on your forehead, cheeks, then gradually throughout your face and neck AVOIDING the eyes. Massage gently and enjoy. Rinse your face for a good minute or so. Pat the face dry gently with a face towel. Take the moiseriser and pour a small amount into the palm of your hand. Then gently again spread all over your face but be careful NOT to apply too much product.<br>  <br>  Smile and you're sorted for the rest of the day. Hopefully, then guys will take notice :-D|`|4vdtR7sSaa	.. r u like 2? u use a cleanser and cleanse it, then put on moisturizer S:|`|ae69df0205dd6e6d96e6d67fdc47b203aa	You have to be an American!|`|8vTpcyPOaa	I like to cleanse my face with a good facial cleanser using warm water to open up my pores. Then I apply a light moisturizer, I personally use aloe b/c its cheap and works for me, after while my skin is slightly damp.|`|UhroMfoWaa	I don't know about cosmetics and stuff like that, but you must find an organic material to your skin fresh! Moisturizers can cause infections and injuries to the skin when there is cold weather or air pollution.|`|1gXo8oHtaa	Use a washcloth or something and clean your face then use a toner last put on some sensitive lotion.<br>  -Shay|`|tXSPCtHCaa	I like to keep it simple. I remove makeup at night with ponds cold cream.  I wash with plain soap in the morning and use a washcloth to gently exfoliate my skin with the warm water. Then right after I shower, I apply a layer of crisco all over my face, let it soak in 5 minutes, and wipe off the excess.  Thats it.  I know it sounds weird, but doing this has cleared up my awful cystic acne (swear to God). COMPLETELY cleared it up people. I was amazed.

Their prices are great. some range from 10 dollars- 150 dollars cheaper. It's crazy. I would totally reccomend it. Oh, if you want "fake" lables, New York city streets have TONS of knock-offs but toally adorable. (No one will ever notice, so why not? lol) Also, find a near Flee-Market. I've been to like 10 near my town and I saw tons of knock-off Luie-Vaton (sorry, I don't know how to spell it) and I thought they were real. They were like 25 bucks.

They often have designer clothes that are much cheaper. They aren't knock-off brands, either. They're usually there because of a small product defect that isn't really noticeable (ie: the thread on the shirt isn't the exact color, the logo wasn't in the exact place the manufacturer wanted it, the dye color is off by half a shade, etc.) or because of product over-stock other places.|`|wmVmNEBOaa	Marshall's and Nodstrom Rack.

My favorite plant at that aside from blue roses|`|AYYDec7iaa	what ur sign..>? like scorpio?? etc|`|nTn3Crneaa	I have a tattoo too, and I would say, that you might want to incorporate some sort of writing into it? I think that would look really nice. If you wanna do something behind your neck, don't put any portraits obviously, but you can incorporate a symbol with a word maybe in handwritting. So for example, it could be a skull or something and you have have a word in handwritting across it or at the bottom, bascially incorporating the two. And since you like green, I would do something like black and green, so the green can pop out, maybe a border around the symbols or the word. <br>  <br>  Hope i gave you some ideas.

hhWDHmfyaa	It depends on your skin color and your shade of blonde.<br>  <br>  The rule of thumb is the warmer your skin color, the warmer the blonde you want.<br>  <br>  If you have really white skin, you want an iceblue tint to the blonde.<br>  <br>  That all being said, if your blonde is flat, faded, and looks like it came from a peroxide bottle, then no amount of shading will fix it.<br>  <br>  Blondes, Brunettes, RedHeads and PurpleTops are all sexy.  It's not what you have.  Its how well you wear it!|`|AA12279950	Hey - us blondes have more fun.  It's a FACT!|`|dYGLyVpzaa	I think blonde hair looks great - I'm a bit biased though :)<br>  Although I don't like people who dye their hair yellowy-blonde - that always looks bad! I love bleach blonde hair though, and natural looking blonde colours too.<br>  I have highlights and they look expensive (well, they were haha), so in terms of highlights I think its important to get them done in a good salon and not off a dodgy person or out of a box! Some of my friends have had highlights and they look baddd - as long as they aren't too far away from your natural hair colour and don't look stripey (if that makes sense) then I think they can look really nice :)<br>  Blonde is generic, but if you like it then keep it! Its important to stick to what you like and not what everyone else has, thats really being edgy!|`|214621b9e16728aa03fa904b0f6c597daa	If the hair is colored right then  no.

I'm into street punk and one thing we do to look edgy (I think it looks SO badass) is dye half the hair black and half the hair blonde right down the middle... that may not be what your looking for, but thats what I think of when I think of an edgy hairstyle.|`|65lAMyULaa	HELLLLLNO!<br>  Your trying to say your scene though?<br>  As opposed to "edgy?"<br>  I think it looks so cute!<br>  Im actually bleaching my hair<br>  before the school year is over, IM SOEXCITED!<br>  :D<br>  But as for highlighted hair....<br>  I'd stay away from that<br>  i think it looks cheap and gross|`|gHyu4Hqaaa	bonde and blonde tones in the hair is back now.

jWmnSXlLaa	Apply white eyeliner to the waterlines. Not too dark of eyeliner on top and use highlighter shadow in a light color on the bottom of your eyelids. It helps them to look bigger. Youtube has some great ideas on making your eyes bigger. It can be tricky I have small eyes too.|`|e6nfGN37aa	To make your eyes look bigger you should use mascara, eyeshadow, and dark eyeliner!!!|`|izHVk0SOaa	Well I don't have small eyes but I use Define-A-Lash mascara and it works really good. As for eyeliner, you can line your top eyelids with whatever color you want I guess. But for the bottoms of your eyelids, use white eyeliner to open up your eyes and make them seem bigger.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://well.ca/images/large/products/maybelline-define-a-lash-volume-_1204304093_LRG.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://well.ca/images/large/products/may...</a>|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	Oohkay, well first off DON'T line the inner rims. It makes them look wayy smaller. Try wearing dark brown liquid liner on top then line the bottom with a darker shade of kohl eyeliner but only line halfway through. Make it thicker towards the outter corners  and smudge a little. Then line the inner rims of the bottom part with a white eyeliner, it makes them look wayy big! For mascara I recommend any from the brand Too Faced or if you're looking for a drugstore brand try Maybelline Lash Stiletto.<br>  Good luck (:|`|HBgOdYsXaa	you can use black eyeliner on top and bottom, some mascara but not to much and what ever color of eyeshadow <br>  make sure it matches what your wearing|`|2pQUMKb2aa	apply eyeliner on one half of the lid, the outer side that will make it bigger looking|`|1OMpG5cPaa	Plastic surgery

jWmnSXlLaa	If you post a pic it might help us give you some tips or colors you would look good in.|`|9D6Y4dYuaa	Hey doll!<br>  <br>  I've been in your shoes...too many times, as a matter of fact. One thing I can tell you that will always give you the upper hand is being yourself. I know this sounds like something your parents might tell you...but it's absolutely true. Don't ever try to be something your not. The girls that try too hard fall even harder. Real people can detect fake qualities and tend to distance themselves from individuals who force an image or look. <br>  <br>  So for starters, always wear something you feel comfortable in. If it's too tight, you could look awkward and promiscuous. If it's too baggy, you won't be showing confidence (which is always attractive to everyone). <br>  <br>  Another secret I kind of figured out on my own, that works wonders, is always wearing one statement piece. What I mean by that is wearing one great thing that stands out; whether it's a shirt that is a bold color, a great necklace, a print bag. But never both. Not to say that you can't wear cute shoes and a cute necklace, but you wouldn't want to wear red shoes, a red bag, and a red necklace. Do you see? Too much is overwhelming, but subtlety is incredibly underrated. But a nice pop of color or a fabulous scarf is completely chic. <br>  <br>  And if you're still looking for something more to set you apart...try a different hairstyle. I don't recommend doing anything drastic, like dying your hair black. Only because this can take a while to get used to and going too dark can drown out your light features. But choppy bob cuts are really in style right now and your hair will always grow back. Or, maybe get chunky bangs. They add personality to the face and are oh so cute!<br>  <br>  And my last bit of advice...take it easy on the makeup. If you don't have blemishes or skin imperfections, you don't really need foundation. Besides, it can lead to clogged pores which can provoke acne. So don't use it if it's not neccesary. However I have found that a little bit of bronzer or a touch of blush can really brighten up the face. Simply apply with a makeup brush to the apples of your cheeks and blend well. This should give you a fresh, sun-kissed look. <br>  <br>  And for your eyes, if you like liner, use a gentle color like brown or gray. Black can be too harsh on light features. Make sure to line the entire eye from corner to corner to get the best results and use shadow sparingly as well. I also like using a shimmer to highlight the area right under the brow. It opens up the eye and adds a touch of brightness. <br>  <br>  So I hope my tips help and I wish you the best of luck. Make sure to stick to your roots. If you like something or a particular style..go with it! Don't worry about what other people think, they might just grow some admiration for your unrivaled confidence. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Stay classy!|`|tZES73R0aa	First show your individual take on clothes.  I suggest going to american eagle.  Their clothes are cool!  Then with your hair try getting some layers or somthing.  If your mom allows you get some highlights.

YB63U3Pgaa	unless you get your hair chemically straightened ( which i wouldn't suggest you do ) there's not any other way you can get it straight. What do you mean by your hair is smelling? Like a burnt smell? You straightners are probably set too high. Also make sure you have properly washed out all you shampoo and conditioner and also try to use some sort of heat defence in your hair before you blowdry and straighten it should make a lot of difference|`|iSBl5MYgaa	for your hair smelling i think its the flat iron itself, clean it. wash hair with smelly good products and some products for after washing it, even spray some perfum or a little bit of powdered perfum.|`|DGDhQBwpaa	use herbel essences dangerously straight? it will not give you the effect that a straightener will, but it should help a little bit.|`|GY6bYaItaa	Just get it chemically straighted.|`|Ezb0o5E1aa	I doubt there is any other way. You should blow dry and brush your hair at the same time to get it straight and you can use the cold air instead of the hot, which is probably making your hair smell. You should condition it a lot more also if straightening it and blow drying it is making it dry and smell.|`|QxQxVPnraa	accually idk if its possible :(<br>  haha but i straighten my hair a lot too and it smells burnt but if you spray body spray on your hair is doesn't smell bad anymore|`|sK6Aoz8Maa	try putting your brush under a sink for 5 min and the water will straighten it for you. it works for me, maybe for you too|`|q411DXsFaa	get a perm kit and brush it in your hair that's what I did and I love my hair!

DmcMDCZfaa	Well first you need to talk to people about your friends, like friends, counselors and parents.<br>  <br>  Try excersizing it feels great and u will build muscles instead of fat. Wake up early in the morning and do 50 crunches, 30 push ups, 40 squats, a few laps around the track, run up and down your stairs for like 10 minutes, and do wall sits for like 5 minutes. This way you are building a lot of muscles and streghnthing your abs. but eat healthy and not too much junk and sweet food. <br>  <br>   Grades are more important than looks. So first ask your parents if you can get tutored, and study really hard. Homework comes before t.v. so finish your hw and study for your tests, and review all your notes every night. Ask questions and pay attention in class.<br>  <br>  For prettiness, don;t wear a lot of make-up. If you have blue eyes wear silver eyeliner, if you have green eyes wear gold eyeliner, if you have brown eyes wear black or brown eyeliner. And wear a little mascara and thats all you need. But remember a guy will look for looks in a girl but also personality. So, be nice to everyone even if they are mean to you. And you will get a boy friend, it just takes time.<br>  <br>  Have fun being 16!!<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|4ff218e2255beff55f45ff64faa9d71caa	when i was happy in life i realized that i had these three things:<br>  <br>  sleep<br>  confidence<br>  religion<br>  <br>  that was in 7th grade... could get any girl i want... i had close friendships. over the years i lost religion 1st, then sleep, and then confidence<br>  <br>  *people who sleep more get better grades and can manage their weight better. better grades, better weight = more confidence. more confidence = more friends and guys. and with religion you know god wont take it all away. lol. idk though religion just made me feel better whenever i had a bad day i guess|`|YSVMFcM7aa	Well.

Sometimes when we get down, the thing we need most is something to kickstart our life again.<br>  <br>  I think if you find something new that you really like or are really passionate about, then it'll make you a lot happier and more positive. Try a new sport, or a new hobby. Or, just start exercising to lose weight. <br>  And once you see improvements, it will really motivate you to be better and be more confident in yourself.<br>  <br>  Don't get discouraged if things seem hard at first. <br>  <br>  Finally, one thing that has helped me become a better person is knowing that sometimes failure is the key to success.|`|f8oGNBtCaa	I'm 16 and feel similar sometimes.<br>  You need to know that people care about you and want to see you improve yourself. Feeling that way can lead to depression, and that's definitely not a road you want to go down. <br>  <br>  -It doesn't matter how many friends you have as long as you have friends you can trust.<br>  -Being overweight is totally under your control. Diet, it goes a long way. I'm overweight to and it's because I got discouraged just like you. But I have support from my very few friends and my family to lose the weight, so I'm going on atkins (I've lost 40 pounds on it in the past.)<br>  -The grades, it doesn't matter if you're not doing great in school as long as your not failing and you know that you're doing your best. You probably haven't been putting full effort in because you have so many other worries on your mind.<br>  -Pick something you like to do, and just do it! Don't let your mind talk you out of it and back into the house. Myspace can be fun but it's a bad thing to spend all your time on, because unless you're talking to real life friends, your putting yourself into a tough situation. I say this because when you talk to people you don't know you don't know who you're really talking to and it can put forward a dangerous situation.<br>  - I don't know you, but i've been there. I know you have the power to fix all of this and I believe in you.<br>  <br>  Hope I helped, if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here for you =).<br>  (aim- ix3miibabii91706 and hotmail-boicrazi4lyfe14@Hotmail.com)

I have used everything MAC, Clinique's, Lancome, Estee Lauder, Revlon, Maybelyn, cover girl. And I have been doing make up for 15 years.

izHVk0SOaa	I have really blue eyes also! I use greens and purples. I think they are nice colors to go with blue eyes. Here's a pictures of the exact same green eyeshadow I have:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://shinymedia.headshift.com/kissandmakeup/images/photos/uncategorized/2007/04/19/maybelline_eyeshadow_expert_wear.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://shinymedia.headshift.com/kissandm...</a>|`|q411DXsFaa	The Best Eye Shadow Colors for Blue Eyes<br>  As a general rule, those with blue eyes should look for eye makeup in gray, violet, taupe, purple, and deep blue. Many have found using a dark shade of blue will actually bring out the more natural blue tones in your eyes; giving you a brighter and more vibrant look. <br>  <br>  If you are looking for an edgier or more dramatic evening look, mixing black liner with a bright blue will give you a classic â smokyâ effect. You can also throw in some silver, fuschia, or turquoise if you are going out and want a funky nighttime feel. <br>  <br>  Those with blue eyes have the distinct advantage of being able to wear a wide array of eyeshadow colors without a lot of mishaps. Blue eyes are agreeable to many shades, however, the ones listed above are the ones proven to be among the best. <br>  <br>  Violets and lavenders are most recommended for those possessing a combination of baby blues and blonde hair. This is because a light purple is the most flattering for most blondes who tend to have fairer skin than those with darker hair. <br>  <br>  You can use violet on the creases of your eyelids as well as on the lid in general. A lighter lavender above the crease will give you a more dramatic look for evenings. More neutral colors are ideal for daytime, but it's always fun to wear purple no matter what the time or season! <br>  <br>  For those blessed with naturally red hair, brown shades will tend to work better on your blue eyes. Since your hair is already such a vibrant color, your skin tone and eyes will demand a more natural looking shadow. <br>  <br>   Help is on the way!Tans and browns can flatter the shape and shade of your eyes without overpowering your hair or other features. In the evenings, adding a gold shimmer is a great finishing touch for those with gorgeous, fiery hair and contrasting blue eyes|`|wdoiVkEHaa	Brown, grey, or silver looks really good!|`|FgjhjRxZaa	I have blue eyes too. <br>  I don't wear eyeshadow tho. <br>  I usually line my eyes with eyeliner which gets slightly thicker towards the outer corners and use mascara to make my lashes super long and thick. This makes my eyes look huge and people always comment!|`|WtM9JnqYaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txg-v1TZ1IQ&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Txg-v1TZ1...</a><br>  <br>  AMAZIN HELP!!!|`|znHTUp6Uaa	never use blue, it just washes it out<br>  i know brown is really good for making blue eyes stand out as well as black.. but brown is better :)|`|tZES73R0aa	Try like a shade of purple.  My cousin wears those colors and they look really good on her.|`|OZKwc1pHaa	Smoky greys look amazing on blue eyes. Line the tops of the eyes with a black kohl pencil and a subtle flick. Then line the bottoms and smudge with fingers. Then using your fingers add grey eyeshadow, using less and less the further you get away from the eye. Trust me, this will look gorgeous.|`|dU2SRsP2aa	i use really dark eyeliner, any girl looks prettier in eyeliner, no lie and u can also use liquid eyeliner on the top of u r  eye lid, use dark color like silver, and black, they really bring out u r eyes. u can get it at icing or other make up stores|`|8vhzpMIsaa	brown really makes eyes pop it looks really pretty if you live near target then they have makeup made for blue eyed people but if you don't you can get any brown eye shadow
24sK6L2uaa	You may need a bigger ball. Go back to the piercer if they say its fine and you don't trust it you can go to another piercer and ask their opinion.|`|0Ji5L32gaa	i would suggest going back to the shop and getting him to have a look, because my lip id the same thing, and they had to put a bigger ball with a bigger ball in<br>  <br>  and if he says its fine, then take it out, let it heal up, and get it redone somewhere they know what theyre doing<br>  <br>  its meant to sit on the skin, not in it|`|QMbxBynZaa	it most likely means your body is rejecting it. so i say go back to the place and have him take it outand give you a bigger gage ! :)
mJbwemH8aa	Its a tattoo and you can put it anywhere, and i think in yr forearm would look good.<br>  <br>  .|`|FDgHnvm3aa	I wouldnt do it unless it has some sort of meaning. If it means something special, then it doesnt matter if ti looks right when your arms are down because its really for you

You get this light light yellow kinda white puss looking stuff. That is not bad though because it means it's healing right. If it has an oder  or is a nasty looking color then it's prolly infected.|`|Qb4P6ruEaa	Yes ma'am!<br>  Yellowy white stuff is gonna come out for a while.

Drb9EP5Kaa	The idea of an occlusive moisturizer is to cover the skin with a waterproof film through which water cannot evaporate or otherwise escape. Occlusive ingredients include petrolatum (a.k.a. Vaseline), mineral oil, siloxanes (dimethicone, cyclomethicone) to name a few. Occlusive ingredients may clog pores and produce other unwanted effects. Siloxanes tend to cause fewer breakouts than petroleum-based ingredients but individual reactions vary. Occlusive moisturizers should be considered for dry skin unresponsive to moisturizers based on oil-water emulsions. This may happen when the primary cause of dryness is excessive water evaporation from the skin surface. In such a case, an occlusive moisturizer, particularly one with a siloxane, may be a better alternative. It is best to apply an occlusive moisturizer over moist skin.<br>  oh, and olive and avocado oils are commonly used in Occlusive moisturizers.
C0HZ8ZB4aa	I should hope you will be getting a professional in a shop!<br>  Was this done by a non-pro? I answered your question on it yesterday. I do feel sorry for you. But if you went to a scratcher, you've only one person to blame! It would be good if you said so though, so you can put a message out to all the other kids here that it's a bad idea. If you got it done at a shop, please give the name of the shop so that we all know not to go there!!<br>  You could try posting the picture on thetattooforum.com, they give good advice there, good but honest! But you really do need to take it to an artist. Get some ideas together about the sort of thing you'd want on your back (forget that you have something there already - start from scratch and find some inspirational pictures of any kind of thing you'd like) - take them to your artist with your ideas and he'll be able to tell you if he can work out a cover up with any of the ideas. The only thing is obviously you'll need to think on a large ish scale, so no dragonflies or whatever! You could try emailing the artist you've chosen, if they have a website, but I would imagine they'll ask you to come in for a chat.

DO NOT APPLY ANY SORT OF MAKE UP TO AN OPEN WOUND. this is asking for infection, safety first. well- as safe as you can be cutting i suppose.<br>  <br>  good luck. best solution: buy a punching bag and quit cutting. hope you can find dermablend, it is a wonderful product with many uses.|`|z3A8meCNaa	Hey, trust me I've tried to cover my cuts (not self inflicted, from an abusive dad) and it doesn't work.

pMFLqU0Yaa	I'm much more pale than you and I wear various shades of red lipstick all the  time. For a bright red, try Cherries in the Snow by Revlon. It looks good on the super-pale, sour cream colored types such as myself. I wear that when I'm off work or I have a date. For everyday wear at work in a "straight red" as I call it, Avon makes one called "Crimson" that I think almost anyone could get away with wearing and look great. For job interviews or other occasions where you want to tone it down a bit, go for more of a wine or cinnamon shade. Right now I'm hooked on Max Factor's "Wine Shimmer" (#430) for the more toned-down occasions. <br>  <br>  If you only want to use one red lipstick all the time, I'd definitely go for the Avon shade "Crimson". Otherwise, buy a few different shades and  swap them out depending on what else you're wearing (I wear a lot of black, so the reds look very dramatic with that and the pale skin I got going on) and the situation.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Forgot to mention - If you have an Ulta store near you, buy your lipsticks there. If a shade doesn't work for you, you can return it. You can return just about anything at Ulta if you don't like it. It took me nearly a month to realize I was allergic to my new facial foam cleaner and they took it back even though the bottle was nearly empty by then. Just a handy thing to know when you're trying new shades...|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	It might work, but I suggest putting on another layer of clear lipgloss(just a little) and smudge it a little bit around the corners to make your lips look a bit more plump(your lips are relatively thin). And the best brand for bright red lipsticks I've came across would be Shu Uemura, their lipsticks won't settle into the wrinkles on your lip.|`|qroOTyrGaa	Your skin tone, eye color and hair color would allow you to do a red lip. You're going to have to apply a foundation as an uneven complexion never goes well with a red lip. Estee Lauder carries a great rich red lip gloss called "Cranberry". I would do a winged liquid eyeliner as well with a shimmery nude shadow and wear your hair up and out of your face. Hope I helped!|`|2pQUMKb2aa	i think you could don't do deep but a medium bright color would look great on you|`|Sf2gFsuhaa	the color depends on your skin tone  maybe you could pull it off its hard to say|`|s4psKJrPaa	whered you hear that? you can pull it off if you have skin like say, hayley williams from paramore, she does good with red. but not a lot of people can.<br>  <br>  mine please!! <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AgsDsPWyyqxOFGIKF4PzYEbsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226134211AA5CraE">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|FeRC5jkoaa	you dont got the lips for it.

tWePoJYNaa	First of all, never never never shave your upper lip. It will only grow back faster and darker than before!! You need to wax it off. You can get waxing strips, but I HIGHLY suggest going to a salon and getting it done so you have a good first experience. But there is a specific kind of Nair you can use. I've used it successfully. DON'T use the Nair for legs on your face. You'll have a sore, red and dry upper lip for days.<br>  <br>  I love the venus brand razor for my legs. They have a bunch of different kinds, but they've all worked for me. I use a thin soap instead of shaving cream. I find that it works better plus my skin is too sensitive for most shaving creams. I wouldn't suggest nair at all! You need to get used to shaving your legs in the shower. Plus, it's faster (and better for you. Nair is a strong chemical). Underarm hair is a different texture, but you can use the same razor. I do suggest though a seperate razor for your bikini area because of the different bacteria down there (I read that in a magazine! lol) <br>  <br>  Good luck! At first it seems like it takes forever because you keep missing places and have to go back! But you get better over time. Just save a lot of time for the shower in the beginning!|`|c0uwtsJ5aa	hmm i think the more blades the better on a razor, i cant really say any good brands, and its not really that easy to cut yourself if you go slow<br>  um upper lip... i havent shaved that... see if you can get like little waxing strips(maybe look at the stuff they use to wax eyebrows and use it there?)<br>  yes you shave your armpits the same as legs<br>  usually for me the next day i see little stubbles, but after 5-6 days i shave again|`|AbAHhcwiaa	I dont think shaving your upper lip is a good idea it will just grow back and more.  when you shave stay away from the big bone in front of your leg and be careful with the knee,  when shaving the knee, make you whole leg straigh.  Dont goo to far up on you leg too<br>  hope it helps|`|0AQF8pnKaa	Razor: Intuition (the ones with the soap around them) or Bic Soleil (be careful and shave lightly, if you press hard it'll cut you)<br>  <br>  Shaving Cream: Depends on whether your skin is sensitive or not, but each shaving cream is exactly the same.<br>  <br>  Lip: NEVER NEVER shave your lip. it'll grow back harrier. buy nair or veet or even just wax it off. it burns slightly but after you wash it off you sould be fine. for your first time buy a sensitive kind.<br>  <br>  For my upper lip i just go and get it waxed. it barely hurts and it takes 10 minutes or less.<br>  <br>  Underarms: Yes, I do shave the same way but I use a little extra shaving cream then I usually do. <br>  <br>  Bikini Line: Shave VERY lightly and use extra shaving cream<br>  <br>  Since this is your first time it'll last 2-3 days, but if you shave more often the faster it'll grow back.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|HLmd17r9aa	Since your mom is willing to help you with your problem, for the upper lip, I would suggest waxing. Do NOT use store bought creams for your face. Nair will most likely burn you (I know this from using it on my eyebrows!) and it will leave a more embarrassing mark than the hair you have now. Go to a professional to get waxed. Maybe you can do some chores around the house to earn some money for it if your mom can't afford it (it is about $20 and lasts for about 6 weeks).<br>  <br>  As for shaving your legs, you can use any razor really. You could buy a Bic razor, or something like a Venus razor. There are creams like Skintimate that are really good, or you could just use soap and water (some creams will irritate your skin). You could use the Nair for your legs, as the skin there is not as sensitive, and you shouldn't burn at all.<br>  <br>  You would shave your armpits the same way as your legs. Shave in the direction your hair grows, if you shave against it, you could get painful ingrown hairs. As for your bikini line, you seem kind of young to worry about that now, but you could shave or wax. Again, I wouldn't use anything like Nair in this area because it is far too sensitive and those lotions can really irritate your skin.|`|ODbwZsnoaa	- i use venus embrace. it's been the best one i've used. the more you shave, the less you cut yourself. just don't press hard at all[trust me, the razor WILL get it]<br>  -use shaving cream. it helps a lot and is sorta like your "guide" to knowing what you have to shave, etc.<br>  -um, i've never shaved my upper lip, so i can't exactly answer those questions. i do suggest you get your upper lip threaded though because it's much better for you.<br>  -i heard it's not too bad. it probably would be better. im too scared to use it :P<br>  -idk. sorry.<br>  -i shave my underarms the same was as my legs. use shaving cream. it hurts me when i don't.<br>  -lol, this is gonna sound funny, but when i needa shave around my bikini line, i just put on my bathing suit and shave so i know what will show. and yeah, you do the same thing.<br>  -well i used to take 45 minutes to shave my legs. now i only take 10-20 minutes. i guess you just get quicker once your used to it?<br>  for my underarms, it takes like 2-5 minutes. <br>  <br>  be careful!<br>  good luck :D|`|0Ji5L32gaa	youl have to try different razors to find the one our comfortable with<br>  and only cut yourself if you do it wrong<br>  and you can use anything that works up into a lather<br>  try going to a salon to get your upper lip waxed, which shouldnt really cost much or hurt much, and better than shaving<br>  yeah iunderarms is the same<br>  probably best to wax bikini line<br>  and with some practice none of it takes long<br>  a few minutes at most<br>  <br>  so good luck|`|z4R0wIzlaa	i am 13 too and i like gel but it doesnt matter i have the venus vibrance and it works great. i cut my self shaving sometimes by accident but it is just a little scratch nothing much and it doesnt hurt. i wouldnt reccomend shaving ur upper lip because it will grow back fast and ugly go to a professional to get it waxed or plucked. i wouldnt use nair it smells a lot and from what i hav heard it burns too.|`|NInBTFewaa	k<br>  shaving CREAM<br>  nAIR DOSENT BURN BUT IT DOSENT WORK WELL, IVE TRUYED IT, dont SHAVE YOUR UPPER LIP, ITLL COME BACK FASTER AND THICKER, you use tweesers. sorry about my capps but i'm to lazy to change it now. Uh yes legs and underarms are pretty much the same but so really softly on your knee capps, and dont do the upper part of your legs, you will regret it.

ZkrGttKaaa	All your future mentor wants to see is the nature of your art background. And I would highly recommend you do a little hunting, to find that possible mentor. I was brought up under three tattooists, for the most part, untill I met the guy who I really wanted to learn from... not just another lame shop owner. If you can, take the time to get to know your local tattoo artists. And show them all your work that you put together. General art ability. It doesn't have to look like flash. Get a few tattoos from the folks who look like they're going places. That's how you get to know them. Then you can just drop by every once in a while. They talk, like anybody else. Stay away from the badmouthers. You'll know him when you meet him. Good things take time and effort. Take care.|`|QxQxVPnraa	When ever I see one they usually just make the drawing and when you present your Portfolio yeah can say what body part each tattoo looks best on.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	jus tmake a portfolio of your work. jsut general art.<br>  take ti into shops and say "Im looking for a tattooing apprentiship"|`|rGWiOVDIaa	Take pictures of tattoos you have done.

TO4f5Zvyaa	Plait your hair into braids, the thicker the braids, te looser the curls/waves, te thinner the braids, the tighter/frizzier- (hint, if you go for small, DONT BRUSH- youl end up with an afro lol)<br>  OR twist your hair into strips. Same applies with the thicker/tinner thing.<br>  <br>  Thes should be done when te haor is wet, as it is 'longer' then- when it dries, the hair tightens, so do it when wet and let it down when it had dried fully, then the curls will be defined and gorgeous.<br>  <br>  I do this like 3 times a week and everyone says it looks good- in a non big-headed way lol. <br>  <br>  I wouldnt recomment curling serums to use with a hair dryer- they just make your hair sticky and the curls go terribly.<br>  <br>  Im sure you will look fantastic (:|`|i38Ev1Zaaa	After you get out of the shower, you can do a few things to spruce up your natural curls/waves.<br>  <br>  Brush your hair after you get out of the shower, towel dry really well, then blowdry it a little bit before you apply mousse. take about 2 handfuls of curl boosting mousse, then scrunch it into your hair by doing a squeezing motion. The curls should start forming. Then, scrunch and blowdry at the same time, putting the blowdryer on a lower heat setting, then keep doing so until your hair is dry. This should give you more of a natural looking curl.<br>  <br>  If you want loose curls, use a few wave boosting products, like the sunsilk Waves of Envy line. Just apply about a palmful of the wave boosting gel to your hair, then brush it through, spritz it with the wave boosting spray and put it up into a bun, and blowdry. This should give you really really loose waves.<br>  <br>  And lastly, you can always do the braid trick- just spritz your hair with a wave boosting spray, and braid it and leave it in overnight.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11229637	your only options are<br>  <br>  1) to scrunch your hair directly after you get out of the shower then put the hair in a bun and sleep in it. in the morning your hair may stil be wet. throw in some more mousse and hairspray and hopefully you'll have waves.<br>  <br>  2.) sleep in braids and take them out in the morning for a more crimped look

YiY9Yd2Jaa	If you are vitamin E deficient, then it will benefit, but if you aren't then the primary side effect will be a lighter wallet. Many people take more in the way of vitamin supplements than they need to. Anti-oxidants (like vitamin E) are one that is over-used. If you are getting plenty of natural food sources that contain vitamin E, then any more than a moderate supplement is probably a waste. <br>  <br>  It is a little like having a container of water, once it is full, pouring more water in is a waste, you body, once it has a full complement of vitamins, is like that full water container - more won't help.<br>  <br>  That said, there is nothing wrong with a good multi-vitamin supplement - just to make sure that you are getting all  you need, but individual supplements should only address a definite 'known' deficiency.

sNE6qwAOaa	This is something I was wondering last year, and I found out the answer.  I had a few scars on my back, and I figured "I'l just go to the tanning bed and get my scars tan and the skin around it will just blend it in."  Well, I was wrong.  When you have a scar, the skin is weaker and is more sensitive to sunlight.  If you have a recently formed scar (like in the last few months), you should do your best to keep it Out of the sun.  <br>  <br>  If you tan a lot and the scars get a lot of sunlight, they will become more visible and may be more permanent.  I know this probably isn't the answer you wanted to hear, but just try to keep the scars out of the sun!  Once they fade, you can go back to tanning as usual :)|`|x7zeMBa0aa	i dont know about scars, but a healing wound is no good in the sun, i think sun def. ades scars, but your sra will still be there in the end...UV will not get rid of your battle wounds!|`|7MuFMepgaa	The more tan you are, the less visible scars are.|`|HLmd17r9aa	If anything, your tan will reduce the appearance of scars. If you have stretch marls that are white, however, a tan could make them more prominent.|`|6kVgsUveaa	Scars unfortunately tan alongside your skin.  They won't fade, however will blend as the surrounding skin colour darkens.

XOoxPm0gaa	I would wear a pants, a cute tank and either a fitted jacket or a cardigan on top of it. The important thing to do here is to wear a fitted top, you want to show off the weight you lost and that's the best way to do it! You may also want to wear a heavier jacket over it and when you sit down, take it off and suprise everyone with the way you look now! Congrats on the weight loss!|`|aD5vY7Yuaa	Sounds like there will be old people around.<br>  <br>  If you're more of an alternative person (Jeans, band tees, etc.), just wear a nice pair of jeans and maybe a polo shirt with a hoodie or something. If you're a little more clean shaven, maybe a pair of slacks and a sweater/blazer.|`|ANc3Icmqaa	Wear a casual top but tight one ;)<br>  Show off your figure girll :))<br>  xxx|`|fligJAkYaa	A pair of slacks that are slimming and a blouse with a high stance that will nip you in at the waist.

WDbE5gffaa	No, you should leave 6 weeks in between hair dyeing. Unless you are really desperate, then you need to do lots of long conditioning. Don't panic too much yet, if the colour didn't turn out how you expected it, it may soon go that colour after you've washed it a bit.|`|YB63U3Pgaa	what did you use on your hair. ( i.e bleach or colour, and if you know what peroxide volume did you use)  It's not always the case that you cant re-dye again it would completly depend on what you did to you hair and the condition it is in at the moment. Also what have you done to your hair on previous occassions? For example if you have bleached your hair for the past 6 months every 6-8 weeks then re-bleaching it again might not be possible, if you just touched up your roots and it's not totally matching the rest of you hair then just sorting out the roots wouldn't be too difficult, that hair hasn't been exposed to lots of bleach, styling ect and will generally be in good condition.|`|SYPeab1Raa	Yes, but use lots and lots of conditioning.  If you do this to often it will damage your hair.|`|mCoipTkbaa	no! please don't..it will damage your hair.|`|pPaCK5UCaa	no.|`|C5PyVxu8aa	I think you should not because it could damage your hair you should wait a few weeks maybe two or three weeks good luck :)

I'm thinking maybe a strapless with a sweetheart neckline that goes just below the knee? What kind of print are you talking about? if its long, you may want to go with a more subtle print, and maxi dresses are already a statement. I think that it would look cute long! I'm short as well, and sometimes long dresses can totally be pulled off, as long as you have a laid back fun personality to go with the look.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	hahah, I agree with going back to your natural hair. I cut off my relaxer last summer to go natural and I love it. The result: curly hair that is thicker, volumous, and stronger. I've kept ALL my growth since I've been natural, whereas, had I still had a relaxer my hair would still be breaking off and getting shorter. <br>  <br>  Make sure your braids aren't too tight because this could make your hair break off, receed your hairline, and loosen your hair at the roots (you don't want this!). Make sure you take care of your hair while its in braids. Your hair isn't going to get longer if after you take down the braids and start combing and notice a lot of breakage. People usually see longer hair (not faster growth) with braids because the braids is a protective style that helps you retain length because you don't need to daily style your hair or comb/brush/use heat regularly. The daily manipulation of your hair is what breaks it off and keeps you at the same length or shorter. <br>  <br>  If the braids aren't working then try switching to another protective styles such as buns, wigs, weaves, and twists (hard for straight hair) for example. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.biracialhair.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.biracialhair.org</a> - she has a good section about how to properly comb/brush/wash the hair so that it doesn't break off as much. She might be natural, but her advice is still relevant. You can even read her hair story because she could never grow hair longer than a small afro for years until she learned how to properly care for her hair. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com</a> - this forum has many waist-length and mid-back length naturals and relaxed heads. You can get good tips and advice for taking care of your hair so you can grow your own hair long. You'll notice that many of them faithfully use protective styles. <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.longhaircareforum.com/forums/showthread.php?t=321851" rel="nofollow">http://www.longhaircareforum.com/forums/...</a> - this thread might be of interest to you.|`|oS70PnhIaa	By braiding your hair, and cutting your split ends periodically.|`|Hmap2B8Paa	My answer is go natural. I recently switched over and my hair hasn't been healthier. My hair is dry, curly, wavy that is prone crispy ends. which was always made worse from products with alcohol ingredients and heat tools used to smooth and tame.<br>  <br>  You may think I'm crazy or gross but here is the natural hair plan.<br>  -- STOP washing your hair.- It may be hard to break the habit but once you do you will wonder why you wasted so much time.-I usually go 7-10 days between washings! I recently let time slip and around day 10 had to go to a reception, used some hot roller and hairspray, which dried things out and ended up going 2 weeks without a wash! I asked my very HONEST family---thought it only looked couple days past washing.<br>  <br>  ---.To clean your hair properly use must go old school. Ask your Grandma how she used to do it. I bet she will say Baking Soda and Apple Cider Vinegar-I take two plastic cups in the shower. One with couple-few tablespoons of each ingredient.<br>  <br>  -Wet hair and fill baking soda cup with water apply to scalp and hair. Massage the scalp well. I don't try to comb though at this point.<br>  Squeaky clean curly hair tangles. Rinse the soda mix out-no comb.<br>  <br>  -Fill ACV cup with water apply to scalp and hair. Massage in and rinse. I will finger comb as I'm rinsing at this point. Your hair will be the softest you ever felt. You actual hair feels smooth not the conditioner residue like with typical products.<br>  <br>  --At this point I wet set my hair with large plastic rollers. It smooths out my hair and gives me those big, lush, Hollywood wave/curls. Carmen Electra style. Doing this is a pain in the butt, but It looks great and lasts. Since I'm only doing one a week it's no biggie. Use the appropriate size for you length.<br>  ---For my setting spray I mix very small amount of leave-in previous purchase trying to use up. and 1/2 of a LOREAL Ineral Hair Fixer treatment and fill my 9 oz spay bottle with water.<br>  ****If hair is damaged get the junk ends cut and do weekly hair fixer treatments (available at Sally's--6 treatments for like $8)<br>  Never done a wet set roller set- no sweat I'm fairly new my self. There are plenty of videos on the web. I use no addition products listed above and use my boar brush. I air dry but can use blow dryer w/ diffuser or hood dryer.<br>  <br>  You are done for the week, or two, or month! Just brush, which is very important. Get a boar or boar/nylon brush. Brushing moves the natural scalp oils down the shaft to the ends. Helping your scalp stay in order as well as providing your hair with natural moisture and styling product. I get static fluff when brushing, but I finger comb and all is smooth. DON"T forget to brush at bedtime! Oh and a silk pillow case is key as cotton sucks out you natural oils.<br>  <br>  Give it time. It may take a couple weeks for your scalp to reach it's natural PH and return to it's natural beautiful state.|`|RFhUF2Uqaa	by taking out the braids and not cutting it .. ?

YuPNVX9maa	Oh god, I used to get that. Your lips are really chapped. This happen a lot especially in the dry winter. I have finally defeated that but i still have to do upkeep. I put on a lot of regular vaseline on my lips at night, and that helps a lot. Vaseline is really moisturizing, and they sell a kind of lip balm that works really well. Keep a heavy moisture lip balm with you at all times and apply it when your lips start to dry and burn. Also, makeup and licking your lips just makes it worse. Don't worry though, it should probably go away if you moisturize a lot!|`|W29RO0jEaa	Dont touch it with your tongue and put carmex on it and itll go away:)|`|QxQxVPnraa	haha<br>  <br>  Well your keep licking it because you think it is chapped and dry...it looks like a gatorade stain right?<br>  <br>  It is like the sucking and licking is making it irritated and red and it burns<br>  <br>  i used to have itt<br>  <br>  All you have to do is just DO NOTTT lick it or suck it at all and it will soon go away in like a week<br>  <br>  also you can put chapstick on it to prevent you from licking your lips again

foMK7Kxuaa	i think your hair would look great with bleach blonde layers right under your redish-orange hair and then a few electric blue streaks near the bleach blonde :]|`|0G1fOjpWaa	Don't be stubborn:) Forget the idea of two colours......you have fair skin and warm reddish brown coloured eyes so therefore you have only two options as far as I can see....If you go any shade of blonde your eyebrows will clash and your skin will look very pink, thats not good, so blonde is out. The cool tones of black hair will wash out your skin and dampen the warm brown of your eyes. If you went a medium/dark chocolate brown, it would go quite well with your skin and eyes and other features but If you really want to make the most of yourself and stand out you should get a very dark coppery auburn shade all over....it would look amazing against your skin and your eye colour would really pop, please take my advice.......|`|sOkTUYq7aa	the 2 pics look very different  . you look like you have red hair in the first one and brunette in the second.<br>  <br>  i would say, try black hair.

r4i7xPnMaa	Yikes, my recommendation would be to take better care of your skin. Make sure you're washing your face twice a day with a good cleanser, then toning, and moisturizing. If you're not doing much this weekend, pick up a clay mask, or better yet, make an aspirin mask at home to alleviate some (if not all!) of the redness. if you google "aspirin mask", you can find recipes. It's basically just crushed up aspirin, honey, and a little bit of water.<br>  <br>  I used to have acne too, and I wouldn't go anywhere without foundation. Then once I found a good face cleansing routine, I found that I didn't need to rely on foundation every day, because my skin didn't look half bad all on its own.|`|zgDxpqRsaa	you could get a tan<br>  <br>  <br>  or fix your other make up to where people wont notice your face to much|`|qroOTyrGaa	Use a tinted moisturizer. It adds color and also has an SPF usually so when you're out in the sun your skin is protected. Follow with a sheer cheek stain if you want some color in your cheeks. If you want a treatment before your trip put calamine lotion all over as a mask and that should help with the redness. <br>  Good luck luv!|`|qB726TKSaa	do you have face wash try that or maybe a face lotion idk blush maybe?|`|trpvcTBiaa	Put on some lotion.

0SsJR87xaa	I don't care if you said not to say it but there's a good possibility you're gonna f*** your face up. But for the sake of your health I'll tell you what you need to know.<br>  <br>  First, you have internet, so go to a piercing supply site and buy a pre-packaged, sterilized, 16 gauge needle. Sterilized equipment is probably the most important part of a piercing operation. Don't use one of your mommas nasty old sewing needles.<br>  <br>  Second, have your jewelry handy. The easiest way to sterilize the jewelry at home is probably leave it in alcohol for a few minutes. Piercing needles are hollow so the eyebrow ring will fit right into the end and you can slide it through with the needle.<br>  <br>  Third, you should probably have a friend do it if you're not gonna go to a professional. You're not gonna be able to see what you're doing properly if you're just looking in a mirror. You or your friend should wash hands thoroughly beforehand. I recommend medical doctor gloves. You know, the rubber stretchy ones that are fun to blow up. <br>  <br>  Fourth, massage and squeeze the spot with your fingers. This will loosen up the tissue and make the piercing go smoother.<br>  <br>  Fifth, use a marker to mark a point of entry and a point of exit. If you don't like the spot, clean it off and mark it again.<br>   <br>  Sixth, okay you have a low pain tolerance but this is a piercing. Suck it up. Ice will numb it up but also might make it swell. If you mark the spot while its swelled, when it goes back to normal you will find your piercing in a quite different spot than you chose.<br>  <br>  Seventh, time to pierce. Count to 3. On 3 take a deep breath while you or your friend pushes the needle through. Once the point is sticking out the other side let the needle sit and put your jewelry in the end. Once jewelry is in place, proceed to feed the needle and ring through.<br>  <br>  For aftercare you will need a soft liquid soap or saline solution. Use it to wash the area a couple times a day. If you're using soap, be sure to rinse thoroughly. Its important not to use alcohol or hydrogen peroxide because this will dry the area out.<br>  <br>  As for your parents, there's nothing you can do if they don't want you to have it. Explain to your mom it's your body and you're gonna express yourself how you want. If you have to take some heat then that's the price you have to pay for your "baby".<br>  <br>  I gave you this info because you are probably dumb enough to do it yourself. I don't care what you say, no matter where you live there is a professional piercer near you. You don't live in a South American rain forest and even if you did there would be someone close to you who is more qualified than yourself. 95% of professional tattoo shops have a piercer. GO THERE. Good luck with not catching an infection, stabbing yourself in the eye, passing out from pain, or getting blood in your eye while you're doing it.|`|AA12069201	1. you seem to have some anger issues that you need to work on<br>  2. how old are you?<br>  3. i don't think you want a piercing as much as a married couple wants a baby...they are two COMPLETELY different things, and it was a bad example|`|IAaPW50gaa	>.> Don't do it.<br>  <br>  LOL! Jk. But uhm, If you were going to do it, It could go terribly wrong. It does hurt a LOT if you don't have your own clappers and pierce gun. If you're doing it just with a safety pin or a needle by hand, It will hurt like hell. The reasoning for ice is to make it numb so you don't feel it as much. If you don't use ice, The only thing I can suggest is (If you drink), Get drunk and do it... Ahaha. It will be the least painful way. But watch out for infections. It can happen easier than you think.|`|gPYTkIW2aa	please be very careful. It is dangerous. If you are absolutely going to do it then be prepared to be disowned. I would use a rather think safety pin that you have boiled and soaked in cleaning antiseptic alcohol. If you don't want ice then microwave a wet washcloth and hold it to your eyebrow. It will someone numb it. Then put an apple slice above the spot. Also you should clip the spot you want with a clothespin so it will be a little bit protruding. Then stab it on through. Do not take it out immediately but slowly put in the eyebrow ring hat I hope you have bought. unless  not , then use a think earring. keep cleaning it with alcohol and spinning it.<br>  <br>  Know that this will not ever go away. It will effect the job you get, the college you get into because people will see it and label you as a certain kind of person. It's sad but true. And I can't help you with your mom. I hope she will forgive you.|`|0boTBFEVaa	I've had both done, four times. I have a very high pain tolerance, so I would say it only felt like a pinch. Others say it hurts like a *****.<br>  <br>  They don't stay as well as some piercings, they're more likely to get infected or come out in your sleep. However, I find them very attractive.|`|VcO87w4Daa	well if it hurts too much you can't go all the way through as you won't be able to push it. many infections.<br>  i heard it's the most painful piercing of the face and doesn't close up.. my boyfriends older brothers didn't close up he took it out after 2 months.|`|0Ji5L32gaa	if ice doesnt help then theres not much you can do except brace yourself and do it<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|RFhUF2Uqaa	don't do it.<br>  and no, i am not gay, nor do i rape dogs.|`|Yi4ja5Lkaa	your gonna get an infection...|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	wow your parents must be really proud!

Make sure you get a ride do not walk this will burn calories. When home sit. Do not get up watch American idol followed by all seasons of lost. While sitting eat 3 gallons of ice cream, Vanilla. If anyone asks what your doing yell at them and make sure they don't disturb you.But don't yell too loud this will work abs and burn fat. Eat large amounts of food before sleeping. You lower heart rate will slow down your digestive process. If you develop diabetes you're on the right track. Continue this lifestyle till you have gained the wanted weight. This worked for me.<br>  <br>  Follow weight gain plan at own risk!|`|64Aijvccaa	If you want to gain weight, you should try eating food with lots of calories but no or little fat.

You should just take care of how your legs look and you'll be fine.|`|i03qjBEfaa	Eat more. Not to get fat though.<br>  Eating ore will fill your figure out some.

Accentuate it!<br>  You can probably pull off the high waisted dressy looking shorts. You can wear those and dress em down with a cute graphic tee &/or suspenders.

zTLuK65laa	Great taste, girl! Love that dress! I think gold heels would look stunning. Because of your tan, try gold eyeshadow, too. Also, maybe some, er....sparkles? I'm not really sure. Don't go for the leggings, but if you do, not lacy ones. Accessories? I'd say gold necklaces, bangles, earrings (hoops).  Try a pretty French Twist for your hair, add clips that are gold and possibly sparkly hair spray.<br>  <br>  I love gold and sparkles, and silver too. You will rock the show!|`|iSBl5MYgaa	I loveeee style.(jLo,beyonce,kim kardashian, jessica simpson) it depends how your doing your hair too (maybe a ponytail with gold loops) or cute girl look with curls and a parted rom one side with a bobby pin...you dont want to do to much.big earrings, no necklace or more innocent small studs with thin necklace.Do some black shoes, no leggins dress is kinds fancy. Keep all the jewelry the same, dont do black earrings or since you got gold cuff.when you have an outfit, there is always one big thing that stands out, you dont want to over do it, its like your trying to hard to get noticed.oh and maybe a clutch purse too.|`|U4bqQTjiaa	Maybe dramatic curls, golden necklace, dangling earings... and yes, I agree with the gold pumps. No leggings.<br>  <br>  Nice dress, btw. I absolutely love FOREVER21!!! =)|`|JKzQN8xAaa	Check out www.kwamzycollections.com for great jewellery my dear. Great jewellery finishes off any outfit!|`|QKyco0x7aa	red heels and a big bangle bracelet|`|fy4ivQp2aa	easy: gold pumps...duh...lol =)|`|6HhO1Evfaa	White panty hose should go good.

Shoes, heels might work, black, brown, green, gold, silver, or white preferably.  A golden necklace possibly, if you have one that is gold-colored.  That's all I can think of though.|`|6sjphNcPaa	not leggings - they are tacky.<br>  <br>  Wear red shoes - something with a pop of color because of the black.|`|Dmn8UxSyaa	first of all, its tacky as all hell, second of all so are leggings.<br>  <br>  if you need to wear this dress, black opaque tights might class it up a little. don't wear gold with this!! you'll look like you're going clubbing. i guess if you are it's ok. and don't wear red heels!! with a more sophisticated looking dress sure, but please not with this one.  black patent heels or silver heels would also help it look more sophisticated. long silver earrings would be good, maybe a silver necklace. not too much jewelery because the buttons make up for a lot. hair up or down. you could definitely get away with dramatic makeup in this dress, bright lips OR bright/dark eyes. good luck.|`|fzAaPFelaa	Ok i would go with a nice red pump for shoes, since you are in all black, that would draw attention with your shoes. As far as leggings, no, i would go with the pattern tights they have at F21. Your hair should be pulled back and tied into a low ponytail and as far as accesories go, since i said to wear red pumps, i would go with a very small red clutch!

LOL.<br>  <br>  I don't know if this is the case for you but I have an oily face so when I wake up in the morning my face is very oily. The oil on my face distorts it shape, makes it appear darker, and makes my blemishes and discoloration more noticeable. But after I wash my face all of that nasty stuff goes away along with the negative effects it brings. So if you have an oily face that is the answer.|`|2DRWQxP3aa	I feel that way.

lGrtsyKaaa	I've never come across an extension with only one clip.  That doesn't seem physically possible, unless it is a ponytail extension or something like that.  I have a human hair extension with only five clips called a fall-piece that hooks in behind the ears and runs several connected tracks of hair from temple to temple across the back underside of my head.  I just part my hair tease it where the clips attatch and "clip, clip, clip, clip, clip"--done. You can order these online or through a hair-stylist.  I recomend getting your stylist to order it, because a fall piece often needs to be taken up to fit the width of your head and that needs to be done by a professional.  Stylists also often have a sample wheel to determine what color you will need more accurately.|`|AA11840910	You shouldnt use real hair- they shave it forcefully from young children and women|`|Fd4EBV1Vaa	there are some great ones on ebay.

Kimonos were Japanese. The Chinese originally wore Hanfu, loose robes belted at the waist with long sleeves, but when the Manchu took over in the Qing dynasty, women wore Qipao (tight, button-up dresses, the kind you usually see in Chinatown) and men wore Changshans (like Qipao, but looser, still button-up).

lPCjNkEnaa	Step 1<br>  A tinted green (a color that visibly counteracts the red) product restores skin to a neutral tone. If the product is thick, make it blend more easily by applying it over a lightweight moisturizer â look for those formulated for sensitive skin or labeled "hypoallergenic" â and spreading it gently with your ring finger or a sponge.<br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Finish with a light foundation or a tinted moisturizer over the entire face. Over application of foundation can cause even darker blotches on the skin. A light layer of subtle makeup will veil the redness and make you look as if you have a healthy, rosy glow.<br>  <br>  What to Get:<br>  <br>  Physicians Formula Wanderful Wand Brightening Cream Concealer, $7 at drug-stores<br>  Or <br>  Eucerin Redness Relief Tone Perfecting CrÃ¨me, $15 at drugstores<br>  <br>  Almay Smart Shade Makeup SPF 15, $14 at drugstores<br>  Or <br>  Clinique Perfectly Real Makeup, $22.50|`|Qgg6i6K7aa	The Physician's formula is really good, complete coverage. <br>  You will have to use a foundation over it because it's very green and trust me, it will stand out.|`|cfkuPoMaaa	I recommend Conceal Rx? Physicians Strength Concealer in soft green. It i amazing! You have to put on foundation over it otherwise it will just be a green dot on your face.  I would use a liquid foundation (hypoallergenic and oil free). You need to apply the concealer, then use a makeup sponge and dap the foundation on your face. Don't rub it in or the concealer will rub off.|`|0JOscjgUaa	Well, when you put a green on red it balances it out.

AXEqOEloaa	My cousin has short hair too and what she does if french braid it from the nape up then makes a ponytail. Sorry not much help but maybe an idea for you.|`|x5SJDvIraa	Depending upon where your layers are, your best bet is going to be take a shower so that your hair is really wet, and right when you get out brush it up into a high pony and put it in. Use hair spray, or gel on your hair and then maybe a few bobby pins. <br>  <br>  It all really depends on your layer lengths. If you have a bunch of short ones, they will fall out no matter what you do. Especially if your cheerleading.
OdLj07Svaa	there isnt a quick fix but dont worry i did the same thing but it was more like 20 mins lol i no idiot move just put some vaseline on it or some burnaid if it hasnt gone by school tomorrow try some concealler but test a little bit first because if it stings its not worth it just a tip for the future get nair sensitive it works just as good you can still get a burn from it but it wont be nearly as bad|`|wSYhEREjaa	put vaseline on it, it said 8 minutes not 10 to 14 minutes! haha don't worry it will be ok. My mom  used to use that stuff but now she just gets it waxed. I get mine waxed too, trust me it's easier just get it waxed, it only costs around $7, good luck!<br>  <br>  ?|`|sOkTUYq7aa	don't worry, it will go away eventually.  It's just that your skin is really sensitive.  Next time, test out a spot first before you put it over your entire upper lip.  The best thing to do is just ice it down a bit, and apply something moisturizing like vaseline.  It will sooth the burn

It is a very normal question and one which may be very hard to answer because people and their pain thresholds differ.<br>  <br>  A lot of people tend to agree that the arm is the place that you will experience the least pain and which will give you the best positioning for a tattoo. It is simply about getting your tattoo in a place that contains the most muscle and which will absorb the tattooing needle better, this way you experience less pain. Areas where you are likely to experience the most pain are areas with a high level of nerve concentration and erogenous zones such as the inner thigh and areas which are directly over bone such as the ankles.<br>  <br>  Some areas which hurt a lot such as the ribcage are usually chosen by those who have a lot more experience in getting tattoos, if it is your first tattoo and you are rather uncomfortable with the prospect of having to bear pain, you can stick with getting tattoos on fleshier locations such as your arm or your leg. When getting tattoos, you should try your best not to concentrate on where tattoos will hurt the most but how great your artwork will look on you when it is finished<br>  <br>  Sincerely,<br>  SuperDave|`|P8xN2IzIaa	eh, I wouldn't know.

bB5d5YVeaa	I struggled with acne from about the 10th grade through my first year of college.  Then I found-out what I was doing wrong.<br>  <br>  We have "good bacteria" that lives on our faces.  They are called macrophages.  They good bacteria eat the bad bacteria that causes acne.  When we use soaps (espeically deodorant soaps), the soap kills the good bacteria and this allows the bad bacteria to take over.<br>  <br>  I stopped using all soaps on my face and my acne went away.  I am not saying that would work for everyone, but it worked for me.  I went from being a pizza face to having normal skin.  So, try washing your face with just warm water and no soaps.  It might mean washing your face several times a day (like every hour) with just warm water, but just don't use soap and see if it makes a difference.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Clean and Clear works good. <br>  <br>  Also i heard pro active works<br>  <br>  help meee<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AhQl3nPgjaNOL3qXEpp5q2Xsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090225152551AA8WyPu">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Ttp7dVFqaa	Face transplant.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	There's not really anything to do, you're probably stressed.

BuctVReEaa	Try twisting bandages (or similar strips of cloth) around damp hair and then twist the hair around the bandages and knot or secure the ends and then sleep in them. This is the same process as our Grannies used called ragging the hair.<br>  In the morning, gently untwist the rags and split the waves with your fingers. This will give a soft, natural wave on resistant hair. Use a good hairspray to keep out the damp air as this will cause the waves to drop alarmingly!|`|uJl3j4ljaa	mousse & hairspray is my best friends when i curl my hair :). if your hair is straight i suggest applying mousse...then a bit of hairspray since ur hair doesnt curl i would bobby pin in sections ontop ur head dont make it look perfect just do it messy.then spray hairspray & let dry or diffuse a bit. i would always get compliments on my hair when it was pinned up looking messy but that wasnt the intent lol i was just tryna get it to curl.but my hair was super long.an then i got it chopped off n it started to get curly by itself since nothing was weighting it down.|`|4Pguvjyraa	OK I HAD A CLIENT(WITH THIN STRAIGHT HAIR) THAT WAS GOING TO PROM AND WANTED LOOSE CURLS WHAT I DID WAS HAVE HER WASH HER HAIR THE NIGHT BEFORE AND LET IT AIR DRY WHILE SHE SLEPT, THE NEXT DAY I CURLED IT FROM BOTTOM TO TOP WITH A 1" CURLING IRON AND I PINNED THE CURLS UP TO SET AS THEY COOLED THEN I SPRAYED SOME HAIRSPRAY(FROM 10"+ AWAY) WHILE STILL UP IN THE PINS, I LET THAT DRY THEN I TOOK OUT THE PINS FROM BOTTOM TO TOP AND THEN I SPRAYED SOME MORE HAIRSPAY.

kUZIWRfZaa	If it is frizzy and puffy after you blow dry, you have an option of doing two things. <br>  <br>  1. Do not rinse out the conditioner you put in your hair after you wash it. It's best to use Pantene Pro-V. It works great for dry hair. Leave a considerable amount of it in your hair before you blow dry it. Always make sure to keep your hair wet when you blow dry it. Passing a blower over dry hair always leaves a frizzy, puffy effect, so be sure to re-wet your hair if you've come to part that has air dried. This works best for normal to dry hair. <br>  I noticed you don't want to make your hair greasy, but some grease/oil is needed to maintain moisture in your hair, especially if its frizzy. "Biosilk" (expensive) and my personal favorite "Softee" olive oil hair products (extremely inexpensive) work great to maintain shine and moisture.<br>  <br>  2. Get a texturizer. This is my favorite option and one I do every six months. Texturizers are NOT the same thing as relaxers. A texturizer helps you keep your curls or wavy hair but allows you to wear it bone straight and dry with NO FRIZZ afterward! I have extremely curly and dry hair, so this is my life saver as I love to wear my hair straight. The greatest thing about a texturizer is no matter how sweaty or hot your head gets, you still won't get any frizz! They are generally cheap in price, ranging from $5 to $7 if you do them yourself. If you go to a Pro at a salon, depending on the length of your hair you might pay from $30 to $100. I get charged $120, so I do it myself! You only need to do it every six months and your hair will stay healthy. When you apply it be sure NOT to leave it in your hair for too long or it will completely get rid of your natural hair composition. (It all disappears within six months anyways, so if you do leave it in too long, the effects will eventually go away). I normally apply it to my entire head and wash it out the second I finish...and when I say second...I mean second. I literally have the shower running while I apply the product into my hair.<br>  I purchase "Soft & Beautiful Botanicals" Hair texturizer. <a href="http://img.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/320076.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://img.walgreens.com/dbimagecache/32...</a><br>  <br>  I've been using it for over 9 years now and it's the best. <br>  Here are a couple of pictures of my hair when it's curly and when it's straight so you can see that I can maintain curly and straight hair with little to no frizz!<br>  <br>  CURLY: <a href="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/MissHelmz/lynncurls5.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/M...</a><br>  <br>  STRAIGHT:<br>  <a href="http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/MissHelmz/lboogdn.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i35.photobucket.com/albums/d164/M...</a><br>  <br>  NOTE: I have very thick and strong hair. If your hair is thin and brittle, I'm not sure what the effects of using the texturizer will be. You may want to consult a professional before using.<br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|2rGTBWw7aa	Biolage smoothing serum will help your frizz and loose ends! also make your hair shiny if you only use it from your ear length down<br>  <a href="http://www.drugstore.com/qxp157569_333181_sespider/biolage_by_matrix/smoothing_serum.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.drugstore.com/qxp157569_33318...</a><br>  <br>  ***also; sunsilk anti-poof creme works great.<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Sunsilk-Anti-Poof-Jojoba-7-Ounce-Bottles/dp/B000FKHOMM" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Sunsilk-Anti-Poof-...</a><br>  <br>  (this one is my favorite ,ive been using it forever. it keeps my hair un poofy and un frizzy and smells nice too!)<br>  keep in mind that most hair products work way better after you get out of the shower when the hair is damp.|`|YuIuDCFfaa	what i do is i get it  little wet by spritzing my hair with water and putting it in low pigie tales. if im short on time i, i just leave them in and take them out in about 30 minutes. if i have a lot of time, then i straighten them after they are dry. to finish it off, i comb it through and then add some hair spray.
SuvinbcWaa	THE FIRST 1<br>  GIVES YHOO A PECHY CUTIE LOOK<br>  THATS TOTTALY IN!<br>  CUTIE PINK<br>  ITS A MUST HAVE<br>  ASSECIALLY<br>  WITH THE BOYS<br>  THEY LIKE A NATURAL COLOUR!(Y)|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Are you wanting to wear them all at once? The first and last ones would be good highlights. Meaning just under your browbone. The darkeds shaded put in the crease of your eyelid and outter V then next to that do one a litter lighter. Keep going til the lightest shade is in the inner part of your eyes.|`|qhKP68eiaa	The lightest color (#1 I believe?) goes on the upper lid, medium (#3 color?) goes on the lower lid, and then the darkest goes in the crease.
ifYIghJLaa	the 2nd one|`|igrdohopaa	I love the 2nd one (=|`|vNBYAIZLaa	first- soooo many people have jackets like the second one|`|kpTlEW59aa	i would go wit the blue one it cooler! =]|`|c0vuxtROaa	hmm winter is oooover (almost) soo idk<br>  thouuuughh i like the first one(:!|`|wWbE3YKcaa	second one!
NEJgU0BNaa	yes
HZN6UFxyaa	if you like people who shouldn't be wearing tight shirts and pants than yes. But to me NO people don't have fashion. oh NB,CT by the way.|`|3sP4Mto6aa	Grand Rapids MI oohh yeaa|`|AA11440097	Spokane WA.  NO|`|sg0m6LBRaa	not rlyy. everyone in my area justs puts together stufff.<br>  im not in like NYC or boston though.|`|UGbk5vETaa	Meh. I guess there are some really great dressers (i would consider myself one of them hehe) and some that suck.<br>  Girls stil wear jeans, uggs, graphic tees, northfaces, hardtails, edhardy, ect. <br>  EW<br>  But, I guess there needs to be terrible dressers to make the real fashionistas stand out :)|`|jo7n4Olaaa	Berks County, PA Yeah, I guess. I mean sometime I see people and I'm like "Wow, they really need a fashion update" but other times I think so people look really nice. Living in Mennonite land doesn't really do anything for anyones fashion sense. If you don't know a Mennonite is, look it up. Don't worry, they are not bad. Lol|`|MrPwK9s7aa	Well the tweens and teens like me are more up to date. as in Dior came out with something that morning they will go to the mall and get it. Dress to impress. Literally. Oh and i live in NJ. A wealthy part of NJ|`|piqkAV1Xaa	canada ontario !<br>  yesss its all about fashion|`|U3veABIGaa	Well yeah! Every where can have style and in my town you NEED SKINNY jeans
3kEzoBWzaa	Use volumizing shampoo and conditioner. You could also buy products that add volume like TREsemme's Root Lifter. You could also get volumizing mousse.<br>  <br>  When you blow dry your hair, tip your head forward and dry your hair from the bottom. While blow drying, position a brush at the roots of your hair and comb upwards while aiming the dryer at the roots to encourage volume.|`|AA11840910	Get layers cut into it and that should keep the weight off and make it look funky|`|KL1GW0wpaa	layers|`|sOkTUYq7aa	get some deep cleansing shampoos, like degunkify by herbal essences.  It gets rid of the buildup, so that your hair is lighter.  Also, if you want volumous hair, definitely check out the Aussie collection.  They have a lot of products for curly, volumous hair.  And do NOT use  a lot of product like hairspray, mousse, gels..  It will just weigh it down even more|`|Rz9kzGBSaa	hair spray
jez0O0bXaa	Warm look at it in the sun, the most natural light. The base level seems to be a 5 with highlights of a 6. Anything with a gold/red is warm.|`|uJl3j4ljaa	the base color seems to be a level 4 or 5 depending on which color brand( everyone thinks levels are the same,but working different places i noticed they aren't)  it's very rich in color, so it is warm. we use wella at our salon if i was doing that color...i would apply the color 5/75 or 5/77.depending using color touch or koleston.|`|J73cJDZeaa	It's a warm but it depends on what you hair colour is currently. <br>  <br>  Because this is a very brown colour I had it once before and from going from blonde highlights I used, Garnier 100% in deep brown - and got the darker looking colour on the left.|`|4Pguvjyraa	IN THE SUN IT LOOKS LIKE A LEVEL 5 WARM COPPER BROWN BUT IN THE SHADE IT LOOKS LIKE A LEVEL 5 MOCHA BROWN|`|vsEWHCuhaa	I think it's a chocolate brown.<br>  With the sun it looks warm...so warm or neutral|`|tg89r7ZJaa	this is a brownesh warm color..|`|BO28Mn8haa	warm. level 4. i have that color.|`|blOfX1nhaa	Its chocolate brown with golden caramal brown highlights.|`|y2nC8BUGaa	It looks like warm brown with highlights.|`|qhKP68eiaa	golden red tones give it a "warm" color.|`|lHc6lgF0aa	looks brownish to me....
lwWicZCwaa	There are two useful topics which I think you should know. One is Hair Removal Techniques and two is How To Use The Epilator.  <br>  <a href="http://buy-braun-epilator.blogspot.com/2009_02_15_archive.html" rel="nofollow">http://buy-braun-epilator.blogspot.com/2...</a><br>  <br>  For the price, let see this store for popular epilator<br>  <a href="http://astore.amazon.com/buy-braun-epilator-20" rel="nofollow">http://astore.amazon.com/buy-braun-epila...</a>
4d3f368a801a90e1ba866f3eb049ec60aa	I think dirty blonde, but if you want that color bring a picture to your hairdresser, they could probably help more.|`|BrNfFo73aa	The hair color is Dish-Water blonde or Ash blonde that is the hair color.Ur welcome hope i could help.|`|YYJ2SlKbaa	I'd say dirty blonde
jWmnSXlLaa	I have used ID bare minerals and it seemed to me a shade lighter. But, it may of just been my skin tone.|`|tfsImr9oaa	no it should appear the same as your skin tone if you picked the proper shade UNLESS you get a big brush full on your cheecks then it will just look like dirt. Less is more.
CO5jcxMraa	i use to get horrible bacne but then i moved in to college and the dorm uses hard water ( which a lot of places try to get rid of now, and i know my dad did we had a water softener at my house) anyways.. at college the hard water got rid of a lot of my bacne! <br>  And another thing i noticed was that conditioner causes acne.  so do not leave your hair on your body if you have conditioner in it and make sure you rinse your body well so conditioner doesnt dry on your skin.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|62oLK3wsaa	i know this is weird but get a bowl put 3 table spoons of honey in it and one teaspoon of cinnamon powder <br>  use it as a cleanser whenever you bathe i used it on my face and back during teen years <br>  it takes at most two weaks to start working|`|Ft7CdRkOaa	I've been using this product called clear pores foreverrr and it works amazingly|`|CDVCoD7kaa	You might have prickly heat rash. Is it itchy? Try using peppermint soap and take cold showers. Search online, "prickly heat" or heat rash..<br>  <br>  But it could be something else...allergies?|`|st5reHVjaa	clean and clear!!!!<br>  use ur face wash on it.
ND4wPcQkaa	I've had plastic surgery (not facial) and it was the best decision i've ever made. I hate when people say just embrace what you have because that's not always easy. The idea is nice but sometimes it's just not possible. I feel so much better about myself now than I ever did. I did it for me and no one else and I'm so happy I did. Isn't happiness the most important thing? So if you're unhappy with yourself and "embracing what you have" isn't working, what's wrong with getting plastic surgery? I understand when people say it's wrong to get so many of them, but I just don't understand why people are so against plastic surgery in the first place.<br>  Anyway, that's my opinion.|`|9XGTjIqMaa	it's a personal choice and I have nothing against it. Unless you have Body Dysmorphic Disorder or BDD and are addicted to plastic surgery, I don't see how plastic surgery is so wrong<br>  <br>  Of course people should do it for themselves and not to please somebody else. Plastic surgery can change your life dramatically and it should not be taken lightly because just like it can be a great positive thing it can also be a negative experience<br>  <br>  oh and for that guy who said people who do it suffer from low self esteem, that's not true don't be so ignorant|`|kUhcypC9aa	I have had surgery and although it wasn't facial, it was something I wanted and it boosted my confidence big time! I think if you need it for your self esteem then why not, just don't think people should let it become an obsession because it then starts to get unhealthy in more ways than one! :) x|`|91nAPOLtaa	I think they suffer from low self esteem and care too much about what others think. But hey I'm no ones judge. If its gonna help someones self image and they can afford it, go for it. Each to their own I say. Just don't get carried away (ala Micheal Jackson, Joan Rivers ect.) You could end up looking like a monster...Those two are scary!!!!|`|Zdh6pVqMaa	I personally think that plastic surgery should be reserved for only those with deformities (either from birth or from accidents, other surgeries, etc.) or with health problems. (breast reductions). Anything purely for "cosmetic" purposes seems wrong to me. You were born with a certain body for a reason....embrace it. Age gracefully and love your wrinkles!!!!|`|xxSGhywoaa	I think for there to be a profession for the doctors to specialize in there need to patients that need it.  The only thing I disagree with is Joan Rivers and Cher proportions of Cosmetic surgery.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	as long as it looks natural i don't see much wrong with it. if people are going to get plastic surgery they should do it for themselves and not others. i myself would never get plastic surgery but if people want it that bad i don't see much wrong with it as long as it isn't so fake!
bCudUSvtaa	My best friend got this done, we thought it would look really cool, but to be honest, it always just kind of looked like a weird zit, the stud just looked funny there...  And it kept getting infected, which didn't help the zit look, but even when it was "healthy" it just looked like a pimple...  She took it out after a few months, and it's healed up pretty well so far...  We think she'll have a scar like a belly button or ear piercing though...<br>  <br>  NOT trying to talk you out of anything, just hoping to share some experience!|`|wSYhEREjaa	haha its called the labret, search it up on google to make sure i'm correct. I think it depends how long you have it in and when you want to take it out. Yes it should clear up, depends on how long you wait to take it out, good luck<br>  <br>  ?|`|zgDxpqRsaa	yes it will close those actually close faster than ear piercings do and actually it doesnt even hurt at all|`|VYFdo6zmaa	Lip piercings or anything around your mouth for that matter heal over really easliy if you decide to take them out. I have my monroe peirced which is on the upper lip and it healed over within a few hours of taking it out I couldn't get the stud back in, but the hole is visible for a month or too after you take it out, eventually it will go away. also if there is ever a day you don't want the piercing, but do not want to let it grow over. you can by retainers... which are little plastic studs that you barely notice that stop your peircing from healing, but make it almost completely invisible.|`|Oh53ZpGJaa	omg thats so xool<br>  and i dont think you can see it very well just like nose rings.
vIyGYz2paa	skinny jeans..some converse..and a graphic tee|`|0U53vlhEaa	Skinny jeans with a tight colorful tee and accesories|`|1c9d381b762522a9849b15cca142703eaa	pants + shirt|`|E9kBhO0gaa	Sometimes less is more. dont pay to much attention to shoes, if your hair is up big flashy earings with a plain lower cut blouse & nice jeans. if your hair & makeup looks good then you can get away with a not so great outfit.|`|U8lG8Ltjaa	skinny jeans w/ uggs and a tank top<br>  plus gold necklace and maybe earrings and bracelets.<br>  dont overdo the accessories tho :)

3kEzoBWzaa	Maybelline , Almay, and Revlon make excellent eyeliner. I suggest you go for waterproof because if you don't, it'll smear or come off within and hour. Get the retractable ones not the actual pencils; you won't have to constantly sharpen them.|`|NsEGvDpDaa	I use wet 'n wild because its really inexpensive and works really well for its price.

She's definitely not ugly...she has this soft prettiness about her. She's not drop dead gorgeous, but if she dolled up (and removed the damn hat) I'd be jealous of her. She should also smile more...genuinely? She looks like she doesn't want to to take the pic...|`|wLa4rKAFaa	What are you people on about?

98YowT2laa	get a relaxer! i had the same hair and relaxer makes it look like nice waves without frizz.  but don't try to do it yourself, go get it done somewhere where they know what they are doing.  <br>  also blowdrying before i got it done made it look worse then it would have if i'd had let it dry natural and took soooo long.  now i can blow dry it pin straight in like 15 minutes|`|MTxZRhiraa	hmm ?  Well i have a friend with the same problem but uhh . what i told her to do was buy head and shoulders shampoo wash your hair with it in the shower (its takes out the dandrift) then once you get out of the shower brush your hair and put it up in a pony tail or something .. I actually told my friend to put her hair in braids so its not frizzy its all just up and nothing sticks out or anything btw she look really pretty haha. Uhmm if not that ask a hair stylist.|`|IlY8aaZCaa	uh. ok. so i have this crazy thick hair too, and it all depends on what it feels like doing that day. if i wake up and it growls at me, chances are its not gonna cooperate. i usually either straighten it thouroughly (NO SHORTCUTS!) or kinda style it to excentuate the curls. and as for the frizziness, i spray Static Guard on the brush and brush it through. oh, and gel,doesn't help. try moose. still holds, but theres virtually no residue and has a natural look. <br>  <br>                                                 Good Luck :)|`|rENVXGd3aa	you can get a straight perm<br>   <br>  and get your hair layered and razored.<br>  <br>  use head and shoulders shampoo/conditioner for the dandruff|`|GXM74MGPaa	If you stick w. gel, you might wanna use clarifying shampoo. It takes out the build up from hair sprays and gels, thus the reason u get dandruff. My hair is the exact same way. Heres what I do. Use that shampoo and conditioner, use a oil serum and blow it out w. a round brush to straighten it. Now if i wanna leave it curly, I wash it te same way, i use the serum, leave in conditioner, and then i curl each curl around my finger to create uniform. It will not be frizzy. Promise.
6uhnyEYEaa	lol, why not? you could also try colonge you like... (sry i hav NO idea how 2 spell that)|`|D1c8cRM4aa	Why not? I don't think it would hurt|`|NDQS5HJyaa	You can certainly use lotion for the smell, but wouldn't using it right after GETTING OUT of the shower be better, instead of washing it off? The scent would probably last longer, and the steam from the shower opens up the pores all over your body--therefore absorbing more. Making the scent last longer, and making your body stay soft longer. Personally, I think its kind of a waste using it and washing it off, but whatever works for you. It depends on your skin type too, Vaseline has some AMAZING lotions. I have extra dry skin, and that's what I use when I get out of the shower. It's like.. cocoa butter Vaseline lotion. It smells so good, I literally want to eat it, haha.|`|xuvqrnOoaa	thi made me laugh... but ya try it and if it works then you could do it on a regulare basis... i bet your skin would be really soft too|`|MrPwK9s7aa	Try AXE. That guy product. Body gel or what ever. I think it smells good. Even after you wash it off.|`|miU0ogXiaa	yeah I think that's a good idea.  It will moisturize your skin and smell nice too|`|qroOTyrGaa	Sounds like you really want to so do it. But why don't you just apply it when your dry and leave it on? You'd get even more fragrance that way.
028xaZCeaa	the only place i can think of is EBAY|`|5KzOOjHuaa	I found one at a thrift store like that<br>  but its the ones that only have the triangle crimps (like a normal crimper) but it works good.
MrPwK9s7aa	Cute dress. Casual. My mom goes to those things and brings me back new make up. Even nice jeans with boots and casual/fancy shirt. which. No bright colors. moderate but fabulous. Is best. those things are just social. oh then she should dress to impress.|`|u1t12bsAaa	She does not have to dress up for a make-up party. A nice pair of slacks and blouse would be fine.|`|Po4Lljjwaa	kmb14199 - Are you debating with yourself???  "Casual.  Fancy.  Is Best.  Definately dress to impress.  Moderate.  Jeans."  Haha!  <br>  <br>  I would wear jeans with a dressy shirt.  Presentable yet laid back. <br>  <br>  Is best.  *LOL*|`|xc6iCPUQaa	Something cute but casual like a cute pair of jeans and a dressy shirt or something...
NDQS5HJyaa	I would say something solid color, so you don't look like you're wearing too many patterns--which can look tacky.

eglpnEAbaa	I know what you mean, my eyes are light brown and I'm always experimenting with which colors look best.<br>  <br>  It's all about contrast love. Using purples and greens will make your eyes pop and that's when you'll see the lighter tints in your brown eyes.<br>  <br>  My advice, brown on brown does nothing. Black works for almost everyone, for almost any occaison.<br>  <br>  In terms of eyeliners, Annabelle is my favorite. It goes on smooth and stays all day. Avoid their black liners though, they smudge.<br>  <br>  MAC has amazing eyeshadows which a bit of eyeshadow base will look stunning with.  <br>  <br>  And look up the link below, xsparkage has tons of videos on how to make your eyes stand out with the right products.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/xsparkage" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/user/xsparkage</a><br>  <br>  Hope that helps!|`|9M4Tuc2Faa	try covergilr exact eyelights mascara in black gold, and try eyeshadows and eyeliners that are darker than your eyes; in comparison, it will make them look lighter!|`|OdLj07Svaa	you cant really change the colour of ur eyes you could try a darker shade of eyeshadow it will make them look a bit lighter than what they are|`|v4mDAZ4caa	There is this mascara from covergirl - exact eyelight. It apparently makes your eyes lighter, or appear lighter. Also depending on the color of your eyes you should go with the opposite eyeshadow. If it dark brown, try wearing dark blue.|`|vELJqdQAaa	you can go with contacts, non prescription ones though, but they can be a tad expensive. Or make your eye make up dark ! it'll make your eyes look lighter from the eye shadow etc color. and it will make your eyes stand out more|`|AA10815622	light shades like  a yellowish brown will bring out the light spacks in your eyes. Also use black eye liner only on the lower lashes to have your eyes "pop" more which will make them look a bit lighter.
Iqh7U5Ypaa	you should use around something just a bit bigger than a 50p peice... i have hair just above my shoulders and a 50p peice just about does mine...<br>  if your hairs thick it will need more, and if it's thin it will need less (to state the obvious) but as you hair gets longer/shorter, use more or less. <br>  Try to use the amount to wash all your hair but not have excess shampoo. <br>  <br>  Happy shampooing (:|`|2v5mKUqgaa	really depends on the shampoo.  you need to build up a nice lather.  try using a little less and if you still get a good lather try a little less still until you get to the right amount.  :)|`|pZfW9Mazaa	My hair is like 2 inches below my shoulder.

iCbquTesaa	First of all : Wow! You look almost exactly like her. I totally agree with " :D".What I noticed is in Shopaholic, she wore a lot of bright colors. Short dresses with cap sleeves are a good idea too. Try printed skirts with a different colored top that doesn't really go with the shirt, and then find an accessory to tie it all together. Don't really do too far with jewelry or makeup and get some red lipstick. Headbands are good too. But, beware that you may not be able to pull of everything that she wears because she is taller. Try looking in a thrift shop, bargain store, or quirky stores like Delia's.|`|US2C6izEaa	first off..<br>  ohh my GOD your beautiful(:<br>  <br>  and i think her style is great too.<br>  its sort of an indie, but yet querky kinda style.<br>  that style can be found at stores like american appearal.<br>  urban outfitters, and melrose.<br>  they sell interesting cool dresses and clothes that i think best fit this catagory<br>  so in my personal opinion, thats your best bet ;p<br>  <br>  hope this helped(:|`|WwVHWz5saa	I don't really know what kind of style you want.. try going to vintage shops and having a look around? Also look in shops that you don't usually go into.. you probably have like 3 favourite shops, but visit others and you might find something you like :) Topshop might have something good? by the way you are gorgeous! and I love your fringe.. could you tell me what you asked for to get that?|`|ox77vqviaa	well usually the quirky/cute style kinda comes naturally and you already have her hair style so now maybe you just shop at stores like vanity,wet seal, and  forever 21...good luck!|`|czAbrzcUaa	I think your style is already quite quirky, I really like that outfit in the last picture. When you go shopping, make sure you buy things from all different stores and try to avoid things you've seen other people wearing.

jkHpeMqaaa	It's usually a dark dark brown, almost black color, or a regular brown. In dramas, people dye their hair a lot and it looks natural.. Like, having light brown hair, or a red-tint hair. But really, it's mainly a brown or dark dark brown color... <br>  But, you know, people can have natural red, or blonde, or reaaally light brown. -Shrugs.- But most japanese dramas have dark brown haired girls..|`|J9Rgy02baa	Japanese hair color is naturally black or dark brown.

blOfX1nhaa	Yea just get it thinned out at the salon if you realy dont like the thick hair...sometimes thick hair is just so hard to take care of....but dont get it tooooo thinned out! I used to get it thinned out all the time back in the days when I wuz in high school but now I just leave it the way it iz....I think its good to have it thin for school so every morning its so much easier to do things with it and you can leave it down and it looks silkier.|`|ATYp6h7Oaa	use a smoothing conditioner ( makes it easier to straighten :) <br>  and next time (if you dont have them allready ) you go to the salon ask the person to thin it out , and getting some layers thins it out to ,,, <br>  a half pony would work well insted of a regular pony ( just keep out a few pieces around your face to keep it looking cute not childish )|`|oche3k5taa	The "poof" has been really in lately.  when you wear it up, just take the front [like your bangs], and poof it up, like people did in the 70's i think?<br>  <br>  or you could just scrunch it...it will still look thick, but it will look like your hairs just naturally curly and crazy, and that can be very cute on certain people. <br>  <br>  you could also go and get your hair thinned.<br>  ive heard people talk about that,<br>  it may be rare but you can do it.|`|uJl3j4ljaa	i have rly thick hair also, i use silky sexy hair for shampoo n conditioner, an then i use chi silk infusion while its wet n then use a bit after its flat ironed. it helps soo much. i use to have really long hair n it bushed out so i got a few inches cut n some layers put it & it helped but not enough & that is what i do every day to my hair and i get compliments about my hair all the time how it lays n stuff but it took me forever to find something that worked in my hair.|`|kUgxskmSaa	get some thinning scissors like this<br>  <a href="http://www.horsetackinternational.com/images/201962-thinning-shears.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.horsetackinternational.com/im...</a><br>  <br>  and use them , you will find it much easier to straighten , if your hair is REALLY bushy then thin it ALOT !!!|`|lypVGSI0aa	I think you should maybe consider a new haircut?   get some layers and have the salon thin it out.

1uRWWQ6Yaa	Tattoos are too proletariat for me. <br>  More than half the people who get them, regret it later.<br>  Tattoos don't open any doors of opportunity, they close them.<br>  <br>  I was never dumb enough to get inked. I was peer pressured when I was 19-20 years old, but I stood my ground. I thank God every day that I wasn't stupid enough to get a tattoo. <a href="http://www.av1611.org/tattoos/regret.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.av1611.org/tattoos/regret.htm...</a>|`|SohrsIBoaa	anywhere with a lot of fat will hurt less. if you cant take pain, dont get it on your shoulder blades, of ribs or elbows. i mean. i have them all over but they dont hurt me. the place that felt to best was behind my arm. like opposite my biceps, lookign behind me. it tickled. but if you wanna look at it everyday id say go with the chest.|`|tCiVuFK9aa	The pain involved also depends on where you put the tattoo.  Anywhere where the skin is tight and close to bone is more painful that where you have a little more fattie tissue and muscle.  I have one on my upper thigh and truly it wasn't very painful but I had one on my ankle and it was.  If your tattoo is very small I would consider putting it on your upper chest or back of shoulder.  If it is about medium in size, put it on your shoulder.<br>  Red<br>  <br>  To Mr. Cooper, tattoos are a matter of taste.  And contrary to believe they do not keep you from getting any jobs.  That would be discrimination by the way.  Most of the people that I know have kept their tattoos very tasteful and to a minimun and none have regretted it.  I don't and by the way I am in administration for a major blue chip company.|`|WLuEIwp5aa	Chest is killer.  The closer you get to the nipple, the worse it is, and it's bad enough that even my tattoo artist gave up on tattooing any further down than about 3 or 4 inches above his nipple.  The arm is a lot less painful than the chest will ever be.<br>  <br>  Though I will say, there are plenty of people with their entire chests tattooed, so it obviously won't kill you.  It just sucks while you're getting it done, that's all.|`|m0KleJrvaa	Your bicep and your shoulder are the least painful places you can place your tattoo.|`|PBMg4OTMaa	As far as I've heard, chest tattoos do hurt. More so on girls than guys though! <br>  Where you get the tattoo does affect how much it hurts. I had one done on my ribs and oh my God it hurt like hell (totally worth it) but the one I have on my wrist barely scratched and the ones on my thighs were almost pleasant!<br>  I do actually have a really low pain threshold as well. It's pretty bad! But I have ten tattoos and am still willing to go back for more so I wouldn't work yourself up too much. I always wanted to get a tattoo and the pain is always totally worth it in my opinion. <br>  Tattoos on the arms are quite low in pain, other than that I might recommend the thigh. <br>  Good luck!|`|AA11986869	I have 5 tats and yes it hurts but not that bad. It all depends on where u get it at and if u get a lot of details. the shading in is what gets me. I do know that some tat artist will let u feel the needle on ur skin before they put the ink in to see if u can take it. u may want to try that route. get luck and once u start u wont want to stop. working on my 6th.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	chest.   or if you dont mind not showing it off.....thigh|`|Ublc3bAtaa	the square between your nipples down to your bellybutton is the most sensitive area to get a tattoo. yes it is a little uncomfortable here but it is bearable, it depends if you really  want to get a tattoo or not. the tattoo you have described sounds like it might be best positioned around the heart area BUT... take great care deciding it is the tattoo you want as its going to be there for a while. also dont scrimp and save getting one, go to the best artist that money can buy not joe the scratcher down the road because he can do it a little bit cheaper...

It makes your skin radiant fast, but still manages to leave your skin moderately moisturized. Also, don't forget to moisturize overnight with a light, citrus face creme-this will help enhance the tone, clarity, radiance, and texture without causing any breakouts(citrus has a natural acid compound that cleanses and destroys acne-causing bacteria) hope this helps.|`|fe1228b2ceb2dd00abc9e693647fbd5daa	I would say, that Neutrogena is the best :)<br>  I have reallly sensitive skin, and it works great!<br>  I have a clear face, and it doesn't have added oil in it, so it leaves your face nice and fresh!<br>  Just don't wash more than two times a day because it can easily dry out your skin :)<br>  Hope I help!<br>  <br>  Oh, and I would also use their face lotion + on the spot acne treatment with it for the best results!<br>  <br>  Sorry for the rambling, I love their products, they are the only stuff that works for me and my allergic skin lol!
ChLyqWyoaa	do not cut it unless you're good with sewing because it needs to be rehemed at that sides. I would wash it in hot water and dry it on high heat it'll shrink down at least a size.|`|xGlp0Yj7aa	I would shrink it in the dryer because cutting it will make it look a little odd. Or if you want to mess with the sewing cut the bottom & then fold it up and sew it. Hope that helped! Best of luck :)|`|jo7n4Olaaa	Turn the shirt inside out and get someone you know to sew it on the sides so it gets smaller.|`|v0FlUan0aa	i wouldn't cut it. i'd shrink it in the wash!|`|Oh53ZpGJaa	uhhhh...<br>  just cut some off the bottom first so its shorter. and wear a ponytail around it so its tighter if you dont want to mess with sewing. <br>  but if you do, cut the sides and sew them back together i think.<br>  [:

mY19PPlIaa	Well my huband absolutely goes crazy in love for girls with LONG BLACK SHINY HAIR. He loves the tanish complexion on girls and likes eyes that are big and have a nice shape to them. I think any girls eyes look awesome with  the right mascara and eyeshadow.|`|84vvo1EYaa	i love black or blonde hair.<br>  as for eye color i love brown eyes of any shade, but that's just me.<br>  have a nice day. =]|`|rdB2Pbldaa	I love dark hair, pale skin, and light eyes! I think that makes such a pretty combo. I also like blonde with dark brown eyes. I guess I like contrast. My least favorite is dirty blonde/mousy brown hair. Also, I think the blonde hair/blue eye thing is sort of overrated. No offense to anyone who has that!|`|TdRgGCJPaa	Blonde hair and blue or green eyes although I don't thinks look matter and the inside counts the most, definetly.

POttiRSzaa	Color, Color, color!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>  Raves are all about the colors and you don't have enough. Also you need wear something that will make you stand out. My friends and i always went and got UV body paint and loads of glow sticks. Ravers are also known for having an unholy amount of plastic/play jewelry. Lots of beads in candy colors. ^^ Pretty Much its all about going wild with everything. I hope this helps you out some and have fun!|`|bd499f5017ffc8776de9bfd98e2a4ef1aa	change the shoes. then ur good to go|`|jI2j3wd8aa	yes is perfect for it.|`|6c0c0d2d763f285ee6c99331d738fecdaa	Pretty cute, but trust me on this... don't wear Uggs.  You're going to get super hot from dancing in a mass of people for hours.  I've been to a couple raves and they're a lot of fun, but I'd honestly stick with shoes that you'll be comfortable dancing in for hours, something that won't leave your feet too exposed for people to step on, and something that won't make you too hot.  I've worn converse to raves and been the happiest.  Sometimes you can buy shiny fun ones at Target, or you can buy Fluffies to go over them if you're into the boot look.  Google Fluffies or look them up on eBay :)|`|5j0qSHXjaa	I don't think you would want to wear a dress at all... I been to a few and you get sweaty maybe you should wear some skinny leg jeans, uggs, and go a little slutty on the shirt maybe a sexy top, but trust me no heels or dresses are good for this type of party

NDQS5HJyaa	To be honest, I didn't even know there was cream blushes out there. I would imagine them being a little more cakey looking than regular powder blushes. So, a regular blush brush is probably out of the question. Why not try using a foundation sponge (which would be better than using your finger) or experiementing with other brushes to see what works?

73551d0e5ca644ea0453a21d28b70194aa	Hi :P<br>  <br>  The best thing for straightening your hair is a good product, so I suggest you just go to the local drug store (probably Longs or Walgreens, even Walmart or Target) and just take a peek at the hair section with all the products. Some might work better than others, but the best thing about getting them at drug stores is that they're cheap so it's not a huge waste of money. Another thing that would help is a quick, light spritz of a good hairspray...I recommend Nexxus. Hopefully that should do it! Good luck, hope I helped :)|`|AMpGR5B7aa	Hair straightener, blow dryer, leave in conditoner, garnier fructis sleek and shine. =D|`|fFQZABndaa	I have VERY curly hair, but with a great flat iron, it can stay straight  for days (until I wash it).|`|x2DweOpqaa	stay away from moisture, and i think that there are some hair products you can use before straightening to keep it straight. also make sure that you're thoroughly straightening your hair. take your time.|`|dYK1KPp4aa	Get a Chi. It'll work wonders.
cAL3BQdqaa	haha that sounds so fun. Too bad I have uniforms.... haha. <br>  Anyways I think you should find a bright short sleeve tee, wear another bright tank over that. (If you have an animal print scarf, hoodie or belt wear that too) Wear some crazy looking shorts (neons, leopard print, etc etc.) with tights (preferably colored, but some people don't have them so wear patterned ones or something) Wear flip flops with your tights too. Everyone has bright flip flops xD Put your hair in like super high side ponytails or do pig tails and wear bright colored raybans. haha. I hope I helped!|`|5MbXjS1Iaa	Haha, dressing up is my favorite thing.<br>  <br>  Bright colored tights, like bright blue, bright green, yellow, orange, etc.<br>  Leg warmers, any color you want. [you wear them on your shins/ankles.] <br>  Short shorts of skirt, bright colored like hot pink, blue, yellow, anything.<br>  <br>  You could do anything with your shirt, from bright tank tops, to a crazy T. <br>  <br>  Do your make up colored, like green or blue eyeliner, and make the cat tail at the end.<br>  <br>  Tease your hair, and put in a pony tails,<br>  then put a pink hair tie.<br>  <br>  good luck!|`|c8VO8ED0aa	It really just depends on what kind of outfit your looking for.<br>  I think 80's themed outfits are really cool because its like neon, and off the shoulder shirts, and leggings, and legwarmers, and really drastic makeup!<br>  <br>  I recently had an 80's dance and i wore an off the shoulder purple shirt, with a neon yellow tank top underneath. I work Hot pink leggings, and bright orange short shorts. With a lot of blush and BLUE eyeshadow.

qOKFuXfLaa	Here are some myths & some facts<br>  <br>  Makeup Myths and Facts<br>  Myth: Cosmetics are not regulated.<br>  Fact: and their individual ingredients must be safe, and labeling must be truthful and not misleading. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has legal authority over cosmetics similar to its authority over other FDA-regulated products, such as foods,nonprescription drugs and nonprescription medical devices. For instance, the FDA can take immediate action to stop the sale of any cosmetic product that does not meet its standards.<br>  <br>  Myth: Cosmetics contain dangerous, toxic ingredients.<br>  Fact: FDA regulations require that all ingredients used in cosmetics be substantiated for safety. If this isn't done, the product's label must read: "WARNING: The safety of this product has not been determined." In the U.S., cosmetic manufacturers are required by law to establish the safety of both finished products and their ingredients.<br>  <br>  Myth: No independent body evaluates the safety of cosmetic ingredients.<br>  Fact: The cosmetic industry supports an independent panel of world-class medical and scientific experts, the Cosmetic Ingredient Review Expert Panel (CIR). This scientific body examines all available data and assesses the safety of ingredients used in cosmetics. CIR publishes its findings in the peer-reviewed International Journal of Toxicology and has restricted or banned the use of hundreds of chemical ingredients owing to concerns over consumer safety.<br>  <br>  Myth: Cosmetic and personal care products often contain substances known or suspected of causing cancer and reproductive toxicity.<br>  Fact: No credible research has ever shown that any cosmetic or personal care products cause cancer or reproductive toxicity. Chemicals found to be human carcinogens are not used in cosmetics. In fact, very few reports of injury involving cosmetics have ever been reported.<br>  <br>  Myth: Cosmetic companies can use any ingredient they want in their products.<br>  Fact: By law, every cosmetic on the shelf must be safe. In the U.S., cosmetics are regulated under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, which is enforced by the FDA. The FDA has the legal authority to regulate the safety of cosmetic products; however, it has comparatively little need to use its authority, because cosmetics are composed of safe ingredients and because, when necessary, the cosmetics industry has acted voluntarily to withdraw ingredients that have been scientifically shown to have the potential for adverse effects.<br>  <br>  Myth: Skin-care products are all hype; soap and water works just as well.<br>  Fact: The science behind skin-care products has grown in leaps and bounds over the past 20 years. Today, there is good scientific evidence behind the use of such ingredients as antioxidant vitamins, green tea polyphenols, retinoids, alpha- and beta-hydroxy acids and essential oils in skin-care products to minimize wrinkles, fade dark spots and strengthen collagen.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/guide/makeup-myths-facts" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/guide/m...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Makeup History<br>  <br>  Makeup has been an integral part of humankind for thousands of years.<br>  Women throughout history put their health at risk with many of their homemade cosmetics. In some cultures, for example, women used arsenic, lead, mercury and even leeches to give themselves the pale appearance deemed beautiful in the old days. Thankfully, we've come a long way from the days of using toxic and deadly mixtures to enhance our looks. Today's multibillion dollar cosmetic industry must meet strict government regulations about what it can and cannot include in products and must follow safe manufacturing guidelines. Today, the most serious injury you're likely to receive from your cosmetics is an irritation or a rash from using a product that's too harsh for your skin. Yet, despite decades of safety testing and a safety record unparalleled in many industries, there are many myths circulating about the dangers of cosmetic ingredients. Here's an overview of some makeup myths and the important facts about makeup safety you'll want to know.<br>  <a href="http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/guide/history-makeup" rel="nofollow">http://www.webmd.com/skin-beauty/guide/h...</a>
xU8ovpD8aa	You have two bass players?|`|AA11083249	Your only ugly if you call yourself that.<br>  BTW; most of these bands that are out there don't even look good.<br>  So grow confidence and play the best as you can. Trust me you'll go far.|`|c56913c08cba588e69362b4096180e89aa	F*ck them, right?<br>  We're all f*cking ugly in this world.|`|qroOTyrGaa	By becoming famous and getting lots of groupies. That's the sweet thing about being rockers, no one cares.|`|wntR614Saa	ugh!!! u guys r not the cutest guys ever... but who the hell cares!!! if u can fuccn rock then that all that matters.<br>  <br>  btw... the jonas brothers are not that hawt!!! kevin is sooo u-g-l-y!!!|`|3i92vjQuaa	OMG. <br>  you guys will DEFINETLY NOTT be famous for looks so kicckk some meannnn asss when playing music/singing.<br>  <br>  If someone sings really good i disregard their ugly looks.|`|aBwQ06A6aa	oh, umm the drummers kinda good looking. Get new haircuts, i think ur clothes r alright. Just get haircuts.|`|gXrwqoTGaa	I think they were just being honest. Just because you disagree with them does not make it mean. And honestly most of you are ugly.|`|7KTH0B06aa	Your okay..i guess<br>  You should try to clean up a little though. Most people like they Jonas brothers are hot..and well your.........not|`|hhW4j8PCaa	People are mean because you are ugly.|`|l6eh4xopaa	hey dont worrie about it <br>  and yeah u could change your style up a lot but <br>  your not ugly.|`|x2DweOpqaa	yea... you're ugly.... all of you.|`|tJGbfxdgaa	didn't i write like a SUPER long answer to this yesterday?!?<br>  <br>  oh yes, you even say someone answered it "to your liking"<br>  what do you want us to say? "no, you're total hotties"?<br>  no babe. sorry. read what i said yesterday and stop asking this.<br>  <br>  ha, and you've got your friends asking it a couple times too...<br>  "are we cute we want to be a pop band!?" "we want to be a rap band, how do we improve our appearance?!" oh, norwegian metal.. bull ****. <br>  GIVE IT UP...|`|tEIGR2vFaa	Um, they were right.|`|govpgOhqaa	None of you are ugly. you're just young... and you are still growing.<br>  People are only saying you're ugly because you have younger looking features <br>  (all of you)<br>  but in my opinion none of you are ugly. don't worry about stupid people online, the majority of people who comment your pictures like that are ugly as well.|`|xk5XK6CPaa	Drummer is the best looking....<br>  <br>  Guy on the farr right with the long hair, get a hair cut, maybe contacts, and trim ur eye brows a lil.  Guy behind tht guy. Maybe grow ur hair into a skater look. Guy on the very left you keep up what evr u r doig looking good. Guy on the right to the hat guy ummm...idk, try sumthing new..<br>  <br>      Clothing try a new look bc u guys look all slopy and stuff.|`|RLK401pgaa	being like the jonas brothers is no accomplishment...<br>  you guys aren't ugly, just young.|`|Ttp7dVFqaa	You're all ugly.|`|7cpL3gGIaa	The only person there I would consider "hot" is the person standing next to you with the microphone (third from left). The rest of you aren't ugly...but I wouldn't call you "hot" either. Of course, if you guys have a great sound, looks shouldn't matter all that much. The JosBros are pretty popular right now, but in 20 years, where will they be? Boy bands always break up (no offense) and though they're talented, music changes really fast. They're sound is not very versatile. However, look at bands like Aerosmith (who still rocks- abajillion years later), and NKOTB (who just got back together)- none of the member, in my opinion are, "hot", but they are extremely popular even now...<br>  Good luck on your music!|`|60FCA8dVaa	That sucks that they're so disgusting. They'll never get it and don't understand the real meaning of ugliness. That's what they see when they look in the mirror.|`|vhXbGB8naa	Tell them to suck it, there's plenty of ugly bands out there, plus people generally don't even know what band members look like.|`|Gl9xW2o6aa	omg<br>  what the hell<br>  your guys are not ugly<br>  you guys are cute<br>  just have better thingss to wear , when you wear your clothes like that<br>  you look like little kids|`|kS7JqjPzaa	hey Fuc* em all <br>  <br>  Who the fu*ck like JOnas BROTHERS AHAHHAHA<br>  <br>  sorry for my lang|`|JGS287Eeaa	you already asked this question|`|HRRfZDQqaa	ugh, dont listen to them.<br>  idk your band but maybe ur good.... and i hope you dont do jonas brothers crap lol please...|`|yhkEyVXLaa	First off, the Jonas Brothers suck and it's incredible that anyone likes them.<br>  <br>  Second, trying to be like someone else got no one anywhere because people don't look for clones, they look for originality.<br>  <br>  You also won't become famous with that attitude.  If you aren't comfortable in your current skin, then you most likely never will be happy with yourself.  <br>  <br>  You need to be confident and happy with who you are and let that shine through.  People's opinions shouldn't matter to you like that.  Either way, you are fine the way you are and don't let what others think of you get in the way.
lPCjNkEnaa	Diminish Redness<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Women with light or medium skin, who are especially prone to redness, can use a color-correcting concealer on such prominent areas as the chin and nose. Typically tinted green (a color that visibly counteracts the red), these products restore skin to a neutral tone. If the product is thick, make it blend more easily by applying it over a lightweight moisturizer â look for those formulated for sensitive skin or labeled "hypoallergenic" â and spreading it gently with your ring finger or a sponge.<br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Finish with a light foundation or a tinted moisturizer over the entire face. Over application of foundation can cause even darker blotches on the skin. A light layer of subtle makeup will veil the redness and make you look as if you have a healthy, rosy glow.<br>  <br>  What to Get:<br>  <br>  Physicians Formula Wanderful Wand Brightening Cream Concealer, $7 at drug-stores<br>  Or <br>  Eucerin Redness Relief Tone Perfecting CrÃ¨me, $15 at drugstores<br>  <br>  Almay Smart Shade Makeup SPF 15, $14 at drugstores<br>  Or <br>  Clinique Perfectly Real Makeup, $22.50|`|JqDkLWeTaa	try a green concealer it cancles out redness alot but not to much also try mixing baking soda and an ice cold bowl of milk and soak a cloth on it and then let the cloth sit on ur face for 15 minutes|`|evnj2DUpaa	Try a different medicine or a more stable concealer. Good luck, and I hope this helps!

Everyone does the side bang, because it's looks good on basically all face shapes, but not everyone is brave enough to do full bangs, which is why I love them and love people who have them. I say def. the straight across bangs, they are model-ish, chic, classy, just adorable. Def. them!|`|28WPZ06Jaa	I would definitely say side bangs. The straight across bangs make you look kind of young and they are a little unflattering. The side bangs are much more flattering and you look way more grown up. Super cute. :)|`|rUNmgppXaa	I love the side ones on you.<br>  The straight acoss make your eyes look weird, and messes up the shape of you face.

KL1GW0wpaa	I reckon you could achieve that look by sleeping with your hair plaited into several large braids, then curling random strands with straighteners in the same way that you curl ribbons when wrapping presents.  Then use a semi firm-hold hairspray.
2fYyw4LBaa	I also have an Industrial- compared to that a bellybutton piercing is nothing! I'd go with the bellybutton. Its cuter. I know people get tongue piercings because they're 'cool' or whatever but they are often associated with oral sex and being slutty. So thats completely up to you... and personally I think its kinda gross.<br>  <br>  Good luck though|`|D1c8cRM4aa	I have both, and honestly i forget everyday that i have it!

KfQOWAS7aa	Leave them, if you pop them (no matter how tempting it is, and believe me, I had acne and it was crazy tempting) you're certain to get 1. inflammation, 2. a scab, and 3. PIHP (Post-Inflammation Hyper-Pigmentation, basically, those dark spots that can take anywhere from a few weeks to a year to fully go away.)<br>  <br>  If you keep picking the same zit, you'll end up hurting your skin and creating scars. Don't pick or pop. Use a cover up, go to your dermatologist, and if your acne's bad enough, ask them for Isotretinoin (also called Accutane or Sotret--it's the highest grade of acne treatment which has 80% rate of no new blemishes after finishing it. Downside: makes your skin dry, but it's not horrible. I did it, now I have perfect skin.) <br>  <br>  Oh, and don't believe people on here about crazy concoctions to mix up and put on your face, just go to your dermatologist. Good luck!|`|1B3ujUO4aa	leave em.... i listened to the "pop em" ppl and now i hav horrible dark spots left over frm thm): but there fading..slowly..weary slowly..until thn COVER UP for me~!(:<br>  <br>  answer mine?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090224144330AAdd6HD">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a>|`|AA11101361	Leave them.  If you pop them yourself you run the risk of making a bd situation worse and scarring.  Keep in mind that the pimple is temporary and a scar is forever (unless you pay for laser scar removal, then it's a few hundred dollars)|`|MGOmVeMfaa	DONT POP!!<br>  i pop mine when they get pus in them just cuz pus really bothers me; then i regret it since i have a hole and/or scab (a few hours later anyway, if you pop it, sometimes it bleeds) in that spot|`|HzCBOwlyaa	ok before you pop listen to me! <br>  <br>  i swear this works<br>  its soo simple<br>  LEAVE IT ALONE your pimple will go away in like 3 days if you dont touch it! if you pop it you might scar! whats worse a pimple that last maybe 3 to 5 days or a scar for life on your face.<br>  <br>  i have very senstive skin im not sure what you have but i dont break out much but when i do sometimes it is annoying because my face is ALWAYS clear even thru out high school....but sometimes i do break out usually around the nose or chin area which is painfull lol.<br>  <br>  but a hot clean rag works it takes away the oils that are in that pimple , takes the swellin down a tad and use some cover up it will dry it out|`|AA11083249	Actuallly its much more healthier to leave them, because once you pop the zits your skin cells are damaged and possibly fill up with more oil.|`|sOkTUYq7aa	DON"T ever pop them.  Trust me.  They will leave deep marks, holes, scars... and it'll be unfixable|`|woK6mApGaa	dont pop or you'll get ice pick scars.
P1YeBCnaaa	I agree with Nancy, they told me Pro-active was great but it made me break out even more. I used cetaphil and did not help.... But then I used mary kay acne products and my face cleared like in a month.|`|c56913c08cba588e69362b4096180e89aa	It just depends on the person. They say Proactive works great, but it didn't do anything for me. I use Clean & Clear though. It works well for me.|`|xuvqrnOoaa	i have never ad acne... but my brother uses oxy pads and other products form that liine and hes skin alright ... he stilll gets pimples uder his greast bangs though but its might be cause his hairs so long|`|62oLK3wsaa	three tablespoons of honey one teaspoon of cinnimon powder<br>  mix together til large clumps of cinnimon are gone <br>  use as a cleanser at night <br>  put on lightly after you cleanse your face <br>  go to sleep when you wake up wash it of with hot water <br>  it really works <br>  it will  show instant resukts but after 2 weeksa all acne should be gone <br>  natural stuff id better for you then any harmful creams|`|2fYyw4LBaa	I've been using proactive for about 3 years now... I love it. Every now and then I still get a pimple or two but I swear by the stuff! It really does work. But if you want a quick fix try Clean and Clear deep cleaning astringent.... its alcohol based so it dries up acne and pimples fast.|`|qroOTyrGaa	Cetaphil isn't for acne, it's for sensitive skin. I actually really like Spectro gel. Out of all the inexpensive brands it worked the best for me when I had acne.

I was such a wimp that i didn't get them done before that. I flipped out the last time I had to get a shot. Really, it was me psyching my self up over nothing. If you go to Claire's, what they do it clean your ear off with alcohol, then mark where the piercing goes, then they will take a little white box shaped thing and put it over your earlobe and count 3,2,1 and go. It is so fast it barely hurts. It's like a sharp pinch, but you can cause more pain actually pinching someone. <br>  <br>  Just close your eyes after they confirm that the pen marks are straight, and get both done at the same time. It's not bad at all, I promise.|`|c8VO8ED0aa	I got mine pierced about 4 years ago so i was 12.<br>  It hurts for like a nano second, and then its over. <br>  Its like getting a shot, but for me getting a shot is much worse than getting your ears pierced.<br>  <br>  It's really not that bad!|`|WQPJ6Tucaa	it hurts when yu get them for a little bit.<br>  <br>  but it really doesnt hurt that badd.<br>  it feels like a pinch.<br>  <br>  you should get them pierced.|`|6ri7AYC1aa	nope it doesn't hurt.<br>  More like a pinch.<br>  But I heard that if you go to a piercer rather than the person at the store it hurts less.(but that's just what I've heard.)|`|82XQwyluaa	if you've ever gotten stung by a bee...it hurts less than that the pain wears off in less than half an hour...got them pierced when i was ten....it looks scarier that it feels|`|mXrOYvFLaa	it feels like a pinch! i would know cause i have gotten mine pierced 3 times!

sUeZ5duGaa	I wouldn't totally dress up, but I would dress a little more nicely. A cute outfit that would fit that description would be: <br>  -A pair of cute jeans. If you get the right pair, they will make you look great and flatter your body.<br>  -A nice blouse. It doesn't have to be frilly. It can be more casual, but it will always look better than a t-shirt.<br>  -Some simple black boots. Some simple black boots are amazing and always look great!<br>  -A cute purse. A purse is a great thing, it is cute and can carry things.<br>  -A chunky necklace. A chunky necklace is very in style and can make any outfit better.<br>  -A chunky bracelet. They are also very in style. If you can find a bracelet that would match the necklace, than you should get it. If not, mix and match a few, and see what looks good.<br>  -Earrings. Earrings are wonderful. They make your eyes look a ton better too.<br>  -A cute Jacket. If you get the right jacket you will look leaner and longer!<br>  If you follow all those rules, you will be able to make a stylish outfit. <br>  <br>  If you want to buy some stuff, here are the links,<br>  <br>  The jeans- <a href="http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do..." rel="nofollow">http://www.oldnavy.com/browse/product.do...</a> These jeans are terrific! They are mid rise so you don't have to worry about looking like a dork with really high jeans, or having to constantly pull up your pants because they are too low. They also are a straight leg which helps you look leaner and your legs look better, no matter what type of body you have. They are also a darker wash which also makes you look leaner and your legs look better too.<br>  <br>  The blouse- <a href="http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in..." rel="nofollow">http://www1.macys.com/catalog/product/in...</a> This is a great blouse because it is more fitting. It also has an amazing collar which makes the outfit look better. The fabric is very nice and looks great. Also the frills on the front makes your front look absolutely perfect. It may look dressy on the model, but when you dress it down, it looks casual. <br>  <br>  The black boots- <a href="http://www.target.com/Merona-Kierra-Tall..." rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Merona-Kierra-Tall...</a> These boots are great. They look amazing when you wear a pair of jeans with them. Don't worry about the buttons, you can't see them when you wear jeans over them. They are one of the most easiest heels to walk in too which is an added bonus.<br>  <br>  The purse- <a href="http://www.target.com/Merona-Satchel-Bla..." rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Merona-Satchel-Bla...</a> It is adorable and will match your outfit beautifully. It's also simple and very in style.<br>  <br>  The necklace- <a href="http://www.target.com/Merona-Satchel-Bla..." rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Merona-Satchel-Bla...</a> It's cute and simple and would go with the outfit perfectly.<br>  <br>  The bracelet- <a href="http://www.target.com/Sterling-Silver-Ag..." rel="nofollow">http://www.target.com/Sterling-Silver-Ag...</a> It matches the necklace perfectly and looks fantastic! <br>  <br>  The Jacket- <a href="http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/ProductDisplay?storeId=10251&catalogId=10201&productId=458727&langId=-1&categoryId=12619&parentCategoryId=12552&colorSequence=02" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollisterco.com/webapp/wcs/st...</a><br>  It's slimming because of the dark color and buttons.

Also after lunch and you are out you can always use the toothbrush when you need it.|`|CSzDV3gEaa	maybe. sometimes i carry a travel toothbrush and travel toothpaste in my makeup bag. do what makes you feel comfortable though.|`|nspaGCh9aa	Carry a travel toothbrush.  And keep gum all the time you'll need it if you ever get into a situation lol.|`|kUhcypC9aa	Yeah I would carry one round with me!! Why not?! :) x|`|9XGTjIqMaa	some might call it stupid but I do that, I carry a travel size brush and toothpaste in my purse because I leave my house really early in the morning and return really late. I wash my teeth after lunch because I like keeping my mouth clean Im not ashamed of it. and I wash my teeth in my work's bathroom not in a public bathroom<br>  <br>  lol u should go rinse your mouth with some water, may be that'll help a bit since you don't have any other alternative :) :)|`|ActoZyHraa	I would do it, my teeth always feel dirty especially after eating, plus i`m obsessed with keeping my teeth white . it would be good for when your mouth feels "dirty"|`|2MKvrydWaa	i've never did that till i was prego and i had really bad moring sickness so i did'nt want to be around anyone with throw up breath.lol|`|QW4jdXGjaa	I wouldn't take it everywhere, but i'd have it sometimes.|`|iCbquTesaa	maybe, if i really had to. i would get those on the go strips that fit on your finger.|`|eus7WqzUaa	Yep!  I know its like-an OCD thing but yes.|`|392052a3dbd6d94cc65100310f44fccfaa	Yes i did for a while.|`|0d62ca9e718f27bf869d294b798f0964aa	i wouldnt but do whatever you want to|`|7ZMilKYoaa	Well my mother is a nurse and since she has to work with people she carries a toothbrush with her everyday to work because like after lunch you wouldn't want yellow teeth, or food stuck in between. So you can or you don't have to, it's a personal choice.|`|19Oav6ysaa	Yes, it turns out it might be a good idea to carry them around with you, since your mouth feels dirty and all.  That'll teach you to laugh at your clean friends.  You should only laugh at your friends with the dirty teeth.|`|c2JIhglraa	You can use brush-ups as an alternative to that. They are the slip on finger tooth brush type things.|`|Td6drVi3aa	i carry them. i have braces and its totally cool especially when everyone smells like a lunch box and u smell like a clean mint.|`|AYH0RPsjaa	Gross, I hate people like that nobody wnats toy see you brush your teeth in a public bathroom some people have NO class.|`|rDb9ZLyfaa	I do... that way you are always fresh & clean
blOfX1nhaa	I dont know but I dont believe commerical shampoos are even good for your hair they are full of chemicals and things that will end up drying your hair within time....they put a silicon inside the shampoo witch is full of chemicals and it makes your hair feel silky and smooth but its realy destroying your hair after time goes by you will notice your hair getting split dry ends quick....and you wonder whats causing it?|`|If2ww2i9aa	Yes it actually does!<br>  I tryed it and i love it.<br>  I give it a two thumbs up:)<br>  Hope you like it if you end up buying it:)|`|BuctVReEaa	No I haven't tried it but since your hair is actually "dead" root awakening as a title is very misleading. In the end all a shampoo can and should do is clean your hair.<br>  The best way to make your hair stronger and healthier is to eat a good, nutritious diet, and if you are really worried take brewers yeast which can be bought very cheaply.<br>  Sorry to disappoint you but many claims made by products are an absolute con!|`|53uOSbZLaa	I agree with Lexy...all the cheaper department store brands don't usually do much good for your hair. The cheaper brands do use a lot of silicones and waxes, which make your hair FEEL better, but in time they will actually weigh your hair down, and aren't really helping the health of the hair at all. The silicones and waxes in the cheap hair products make you think your hair is getting healther because it feels softer and smoother, but it's really doing nothing other than coating your hair with the wax or silicone.<br>  <br>  I quit using cheap brands long ago. You really do get what you pay for when it comes to hair products. I saw a tremendous improvement in my hair when I started buying good products. Also, with the salon shampoos/conditioners, they are actually more concentrated than the cheap brands, so your products will go a lot farther than you'd think, since you're having to use less product to cleanse/condition your hair. <br>  <br>  If you want some products that are actually GOOD for your hair and add body/volume, I'd recommend the Joice Body Luxe line, the Redken Bodyfull line, the Sebastian Body Double line, Big Sexy Hair Big Volume line, etc. I have fine somewhat flat hair myself, and all the above shampoos/conditioners have done great for me. Biolage also makes a good line for volume called Volumatherapie which is one of my favorites.|`|jKBQgwEqaa	its a really good shampoo u should get it!!!!
bhyUX6kkaa	You don't need to be licensed to work as a makeup artist in most places, unless you are working at a salon or spa or somewhere that serves the public like that. <br>  If you just want to work at private events like weddings, film sets, fashion sets... you don't to be state licensed. <br>  <br>  This means that when schools give certificates, even the big schools like MUD, they are just certifying that you finished their curriculum. You're proving you took a course and nothing more. <br>  <br>  Anyone can issue a certificate of completion. If you did what the certificate said you did then there is no question of legitimacy. <br>  <br>  If you want a license then you need to go a state board certified school for them to issue a legitimate license.
P7rosHBNaa	9<br>  I think it would make yours eyes show up really well.|`|MTcs2pKwaa	YES,YES,AND YES!You would look so better in black hair!|`|kS7JqjPzaa	Yes you would look like Kate perry|`|AXEqOEloaa	I like the color it is, your are to light for black hair. Keep in mind natural black hair looks way different then when it comes from a bottle.|`|dlmVTt18aa	You would look better with black hair:) Beautiful eyes btw.|`|RN7NzeCsaa	yeah you would!
TdRgGCJPaa	Ok.<br>  :) back to you too :)!!!!<br>  I think you should ask for LONG layers, and sidebangs all the way over, on the left side. Then, ask for her to only take off two inches (point to right under your Sternum, if that makes sense). Then, well, that's it, great luck to you and your family and stuff!!!!|`|sOkTUYq7aa	sshe has awesomeeee hair<br>  for straight, just ask for long layers, with straight bangs across<br>  for curly, again long layers , and style it yourself with a curling iron.  If you want it permanent, go for a perm.  I would describe it as snake like curls, or just get your hair washed and tell them how you like the look of your hair when it's wet

Guy's like that!|`|FxAD44Moaa	the breast region,  normally it's indicated about a woman's breast size but there's some men  who are broad across the lower chest region  (male  breast)  especially if they lift weights and have a broad chest area.<br>  <br>  top heavy.<br>  <br>  :D|`|HRRfZDQqaa	they have all their weight on the top half of their body. the torso and up..<br>  but then their legs and thighs are pretty thin|`|WpaQKpckaa	BIG Boobs.|`|Ke9cILe6aa	Big boobies..<br>  <br>  BIG  B(.)(.)BIES|`|WvpjQv9uaa	That the person's body wieght is distributed more above their waist and less to their lower body.

AILK0BTiaa	yes..very possible. the taller you are the larger your size can be and you are still slim.. for instance a five foot ten woman in a size six would be very very slim.. too slim actually.. :o)|`|xqQO81Omaa	If a woman is tall and large framed then she'd probably be better of as a size 14 than a size 10.<br>  <br>  UK sizes*|`|UIueiJnZaa	Yes of course!<br>  Actually sounds very nice.<br>  I'm 5ft 3, and a size 6-8. But I don't look that slim as I'm so short, so I look quite 'dumpy'.<br>  I'd prefer to be tall and slim. It would be lush to have jeans that actually fit!<br>  So in answer to your question (which is a little confusing) yes they could be a size 10 quite easily. If it fits it fits, if it doesn't... make it!<br>  x
CBJge2kxaa	I think you should stick with one product for several weeks there is no miracle cure out there.  I found that Proactiv works very well but it generally takes a couple of weeks to really work and can actually seem like it is getting worse then better at first.  Also try drinking lots of water it keep your sking clearer|`|AA11101361	Try using Oil of Olay.  They really are good for dry skin.  Go with Total Effect Daily Cleanser (it's for acne and cream cleansers are great on dry sensitive skin) and Fragrance Free Moisturizer.  There's also a cream to treat spots if you currently have a breakout.|`|k7jInxBXaa	there is this lotion that is works amazing on dry skin, I don't remember what it's called but it starts with E. sorry if that doesn't help much, but<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  can you answer my question?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqYe50_LRTLCLhh0HupkCb7sy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226145848AAupUxb">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|2DRWQxP3aa	baby lotin will make your skin silky smooth. I love it! And you can use it in your hair. heck, you could even use it in your eyes cause it doesn't sting. lol. I love that stuff!|`|RVqw1C8baa	I USE CLEARISIL DAILY PORE CLEANSING. whatever you do dont get clearisil ULTRA! that stuff IS SOOOO BAD. after you used daily pore cleansing pads use aveeno cream (just a tad) to prevent dryness|`|dv8267AAaa	Be aware that some products may give you the advantage of having clean, smooth, radiant looking skin... but some also have downfalls.<br>  Such as pulling/ tighting your face.|`|0G1fOjpWaa	Clearasil? Proactive? Clean and clear? Oh my god, you don't use these products on dry or sensitive skin, they're too harsh even for oily skin.....The way you describe your skin tells me that you need natural products to really moisturize and not irritate your skin, my advice is to go to a good pharmacy and buy some rose water and glycerine mixture, its cheap, it wont irritate your skin and it smells of roses! what more could you want:) If you can't get that or you find it not quite moisturizing enough then i would get some almond oil and maybe warm it up a little and massage onto your face twice or three times a day. Don't wash your face for a couple of days.....strange advice I know but washing it every day is unnecessary if its very dry.|`|evnj2DUpaa	Try Lancome products.They are a bit pricey, but they cleanse very well and are available for all skin types. You could also try Nivea, but I have no idea what those are like. Any moisturizer is good, you may want to dab a little bit of lotion on your face after you wash it. Also try moisturizing face masques, they work wonders. Aveeno is good too, just dab a little bit on your face. Good luck!|`|62oLK3wsaa	honey and cinnamon i call it honimon<br>  it really works my aunt is a "skintoligist"<br>  to make it put three tabespoons of honey and one teaspoon of honey in a bottle <br>  use it as a cleanser  before you go to bed then lightly spread it on you infected areas and wash of in the morning with hot water <br>  <br>  it works amazing but it can take as long as two weaks to start working<br>  it also works as a moisturizer <br>  im 24 now and i still use it as a moisturizer

r4i7xPnMaa	First off, Studio fix fluid and studio fix powder aren't meant to go together. They're two different kinds of foundation. So basically, you're wearing two layers of medium-coverage foundation (waaaaay too much!), which might explain why you're breaking out. Pick one or the other (liquid if you have dry skin, powder if you're oily) and roll with that. If you're looking for a powder to set your liquid foundation, try a translucent pressed powder.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for fuller coverage, try Studio Sculpt foundation, or pick up the Studio Finish concealer to cover up your imperfections, and use one of the studio fix foundations to even out your skintone.<br>  <br>  <br>  As far as MAC being bad for your skin, check out this video. The girl is an ex-MAC employee, so if anybody would know, it's her.<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2uM_l0wT-Q" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2uM_l0wT...</a><br>  <br>  Basically, most types of makeup aren't bad for your skin. You just need to make sure you're applying non-expired makeup in a sanitary fashion. If you put on liquid foundation and rub it in with your fingers, are your hands clean? Use some purell beforehand to prevent any bacteria from jumping from your hands onto your face. <br>  Do you use a makeup sponge? Switch it out for a new one at least every week if you're using liquid foundation, or every 2 weeks if you're using a powder, The bacteria from your makeup sitting out in the sponge all day multiplies throughout the week, and every time you re-use your sponge, you're just putting more of the same stuff onto your face.<br>  Do you use brushes? If you're using liquid foundation, you absolutely MUST clean your foundation brush every single day. Clean the rest of your brushes at least twice a week, and deep-clean them with baby shampoo at least once a week. You can make your own brush cleaner by following the simple instructions here:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FwklwLsSSg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FwklwLsS...</a> <br>  Oh,  and NEVER want to touch a dirty brush or sponge to the bottle of liquid foundation. Pour a little blob of foundation onto your (clean, ideally Purell'd) hand, and swirl your brush/sponge/applicator around in the blob. This will also help your makeup last longer, because you'll notice you end up using less.<br>  And always make sure you wash your face when you wake up in the morning and before you go to bed at night.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps, and if you need any more help, feel free to ask!|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	Mac's coverage is very nice, but I breakout to almost every type of foundation in Mac.|`|SA6dCr0Laa	How are u applying your MAC makeup? If you're using brushes are u cleaning them properly? Usually this is the problem. People think its the make up thats making them breakout when in fact is the bacteria accumulated in the brushes. Also do u dip ur brush back into the makeup or do u pour some out on the side? If you touch ur brushes to your makeup u are putting back any bacteria on the brush into you makeup leading u to breakout everytime u use it.<br>  Also, if u share your makeup with your friends that might bring bacteria to your makeup.|`|6pouFxBCaa	MAC is usually really good with skin, super safe and everything.<br>  MAC is a good brand, so maybe if you just used it for lips and eyes you'd avoid breakouts.
Qgg6i6K7aa	My husband likes the soda flavored ones.|`|Drb9EP5Kaa	My boyfriend really love the C.O. bigelow's mentha lipshine ones, they're really really sweet without any chemical taste, and makes my lips really soft(that's what he said anyways, the sweet and soft).

AA11101361	Whatever you prefer.  Neither has more or less benefit to your skin.  I prefer showers since I think that a bath is just sitting around in filthy water.|`|dv8267AAaa	I would assume taking a shower is more efficient, than taking a bath daily... why?<br>  Few reasons:<br>  -Bath water may become dirty<br>  -Body may sit in bath water long enough to become wrinkeld|`|ClZWgDoxaa	I would assume a bath because then you can put all that fizzy stuff they sell (moisturizers that mix with the water in order to hydrate your skin..) with a shower it's kind of like just no hydration thus drying your skin.|`|kKiAFJJ3aa	I would say showers, because the bath water can become dirty and there can be bacteria on the floor of your shower so putting your body on it could cause bacne or other body breakouts.|`|g0Jd46Xxaa	showers, bath water stays dirty|`|7bd97da03ce5561a49ac83c7af2cd7f2aa	i like bath's better, its whatever u prefer.|`|VTgGRzQAaa	Hi there,<br>  <br>  Whatever you like! There is no difference looking from the water perspective. If you need to relax I would say warm bath, but if you just need to refresh - shower.<br>  For both you can get a lot of nice stuff to use. So do whatever you like and don't let anybody else to tell you different.<br>  <br>  :-D|`|RcvLXyuzaa	Showers are better because they rinse all the dirt and oil off of you. If u take a bath u r sitting in ur own dirt. ewww right?!!!! First take a quick shower and then relax in a hot bath.|`|ZgW0KacZaa	A shower because bath water will end up getting dirty, it will be bathing in your own dirt.
nCIR89sXaa	Make up that would really make green eyes pop is bronze eyeshadow on the top of your eyelid. Also mascara and eyeliner.<br>  For hair one thing that is really cute is to put it in a "poof" or like a cute messy bun <br>  For clothes it depends on your style but i personally like stores like forever 21 and hollister and wet seal and macys<br>  <br>  best of luck<br>  <br>  <br>  (:|`|5EEN5vo5aa	itd be better if you put up a pic<br>  (:|`|nQFQaEngaa	do your own style!!!<br>  GOSH!
2fYyw4LBaa	Yes Ive used proactiv for 3 years and Yes it does work! If you use it daily, and dont skip steps it really does clear up your skin! Its worth the money but if you dont have the money try buying 'Clean and Clear- Deep cleansing astringent' - its alcohol based that helps get rid of blackheads, acne, pimples, and blemishes. You can buy it at any drug store!|`|WKoG3ujFaa	Yes, i use it! and it works!!!!<br>  umm the only thing about it is its VERY time consuming lol you have to use it every morning and night and after u sweat otherwise it wont work.  When i first bought it i used it but sometimes i skipped a day or forgot whatever, but it didnt work. About a year later i just wanted to try it again and i did and now im still using it. just make sure u maintain it otherwise it wont work.  Also i do still occasionly break out like when im stessed or get my period but its not as bad as it could be|`|BGCiqQFgaa	My dermatologist told me that proactiv is a bad idea, because the product is only a temporary solution. It will damage your skin and you'll have to keep buying it or you will break out again. I use natural skin care products and things from the derm. that work very well.|`|CO5jcxMraa	yes it does work but make sure you use all three steps twice a day.<br>  its a hassle but for clearer skin, girl, just do it<br>  it might take a week or two but dont expect something to work in a day.<br>  <br>  good luck|`|xROIQPPeaa	Proactiv actually does work, but I wouldn't recommend it.  The chemicals in Proactiv are very strong, enough to bleach towels, which dries out your skin A LOT.  <br>  <br>  I used Proactiv a while ago and stopped after about 3 months.  It dried out my skin so much, that my skin actually started to peel.<br>  <br>  Instead, I'd recommend you go to your family doctor or a dermatologist for acne cream.  It's much more safe for your skin.
l1FfxlwAaa	umm... i dont think ur hair supports a mohawk|`|GXM74MGPaa	Yeah do not use gel. If u wanna get a mohawk, use glue. It wont make it curly, and it is not bad for your hair. Or hair spray. DO NOT USE GEL.|`|7o3ArWnCaa	get a relaxer on your hair. (get it done professionally ) this will straighten your hair but don't go swimming in cloren while the relaxer is still in your hair.|`|i09pUyE4aa	don't gel it.<br>  try hair spraying it,<br>  but i can't guarantee it'll work since i don't know what your hair is like.|`|lcKWwhFaaa	don't use so much gel. perhaps?<br>  orr use glue <br>  thats what my friend does.<br>  it sounds crazy buttt it works good.|`|QkfGYIcxaa	don't get a Mohawk|`|aU7xvYA2aa	get a perm|`|6aXzlIg1aa	try flatting ur hair then get it but you will always have to flaten it

However, I used to but stopped cos I found it more comfortable without one.|`|97a7d25a569ecc28c857f02a34b7fd9baa	I would recommand you to go without a belt when you go commando in jeans, but it's up to you.  If your pants are a couple sized too big, than wear a belt to be safe.  Deffinetly go commando, get rid of those underwear.|`|mjDdy67Jaa	i can do it without|`|L9kqt0LLaa	Instead of ditching your underwear when it gets hot, why not ditch the jeans and find something with a thinner material? That would make more sense and be less gross. <br>  <br>  If you do decide to go down the gross route, then I'd definitely wear a belt, as people do not wish to see your crack. Oh, and don't forget to wash you jeans on a daily basis, otherwise you'll smell like a tramp.|`|PHKayk0oaa	wat s commando??|`|HHnQyjFBaa	If your fly comes undone, you're in big trouble there buddy.|`|x2DweOpqaa	my guy friends who go commando usually don't wear a belt, or use a shoe string as a belt. however, remember that if you use a shoe string, it kindof looks like you're wearing a thong when you bend over haha.|`|MrPwK9s7aa	Depends on the belt. Belt and cargo gut shorts with a polo or Tee look ok.|`|EgJftrXGaa	....

t6ZZMFeSaa	The best way to do it is take a bobby pin , at the end there is a hole, place the bobby pin over the pimple (pimple in the hole) and push down on it. This makes it so that when your finished popping it you cant see any marks. Make sure the zit is ready because if you have the habit of squishing zits before there ready it marks up your face.|`|JqDkLWeTaa	i highly do not recomend it but with CLEAN  hands and a clean face first drain the zit by holding a very hot cloth on it but not like too hot and then slightly squeeze the zit between ur thumbs if it doesnt pop leave it|`|D3Ru7ghsaa	squeeze them from both sides until the skin breaks and white stuff comes out... EW!<br>  but i wouldnt do it, it can leave scars and thats worse.|`|QrJme3hdaa	Don't pop them, use Mary Kay Acne Treatment Gel.<br>  <br>  Look at my website <a href="http://www.marykay.com/nalli" rel="nofollow">http://www.marykay.com/nalli</a>|`|CO5jcxMraa	make sure you wait till it's ready and you start by applying pressure from outside and work your way in..|`|c56913c08cba588e69362b4096180e89aa	I suggest you don't. wait till they naturally leave.|`|c8f7Htx3aa	apply warm moist heat, its not good to pop them unless they are at a white head. If they are at a white head apply warm moist heat then use a sterilized pin or needle and lightly prick the pimple with it, lightly apply pressure and follow with tea tree oil or astringent. Never squeeze pimples it can cause scarring.|`|dwkurIyNaa	i have a friend named eudora who's really good at popping pimples and she like totally shows me how to do it sometimes.<br>  <br>  so anyways what she told me is that you need to push your fingers inward toward the pimple then wait until the liquid stuff comes out...<br>  <br>  she told me that the puss might cause infection because one time she had a cut and the puss got in and it was swolen for days.

X6gAFO6daa	first off you're not associated with abercrombie so using an email address like that could get you sued or suspicious of scamming. use your own, unless its stupid and immature.<br>  Tell them your full name and/or the name you go by, your age, address, sizes, and descriptions of your features like hair length or eye color. U may also wanna slip in any prior modeling experience, if any.
bGWcSAGCaa	The skin around the chin and mouth is extremely sensitive, which you've likely discovered from tweezing the area.  Electrolysis can be equally uncomfortable, especially since the same follicles will be treated repeatedly until they're no longer able to generate hair growth.  This equates to many trips over the course of many months, even for a small area such as yours.  For such treatment, I'd plan on a minumum of $2500, though you could easily spend twice or thrice that.  That said, there's no guarantee you'll be hair free.  Also be aware that electrolysis can cause scarring, depending on factors that may not always be in the control of the aesthetician or office performing the procedure.  Laser treatment is another possibility, but I don't have a clue on the cost or results.  My advice would be to consult with one or more drs and aestheticians before jumping ahead with electrolysis.  Perhaps your current prescription will provide the best longterm results and least trauma at no more expense.  Good luck to you.

c8VO8ED0aa	Well for you it should be really easy to get your acne away since you dont have that many.<br>  <br>  You need to wash your face morning and night with a good cleanser. <br>  ex. neutrogena, dove, or cetaphil products work really well. <br>  <br>  I also use Acne Stress Control its by neutrogena and works really well!<br>  It treats the acne even before it emerges, hydrates and softens, and reduces redness!<br>  <br>  Just make sure to wash your face! and if it gets worse you can always go to a dermatoligist they help a lot!|`|wziA3f4Naa	Do your parents have bad skin? If they do, do yourself a favor and get in a routine of taking GOOD care of your skin. I had bad acne(still do but its controlled) my mom's skin was very bad, and she has alot of scarring. i didn't take the best care of my skin when I was about 15 when it all started because i didn't know how. As a result I have some scarring. I am not trying to scar you, just telling you if you think it will be a problem down the line, look into a salicylic face wash or go to the dermatologist. Get good rest and eat healthy. DO NOT OVERWASH you face only twice a day and you should be okay. Gentle is key. I hope this helps.|`|C44Ux50paa	i would use cleanser only once a day or every other day. if you dry your skin out too much it will make your skin worse.

Hope it helps!|`|Bi34oNnvaa	If you dont want to use any heat I would set it in rollers...theres two kinds you can use,the hard plastic  kind and the soft kind that have the snaps attatched. With the hard plastic ones you would add a setting lotion(light gel ) to damp hair and take quarter inch sections and roll in the direction you want the curls to go if you dont use any heat like blow dryer though it will take a long time to dry. The other snap closen rollers you can roll your hair with at night and take them out in the morning and comb through with your fingers and youll have curly hair...you dont need to wet your hair when you use these kinds but they have to stay in overnight.I never found them to be too uncomforatable to sleep with tough. You can find them in the hair styling product section at Walmart. Good luck. P.S. Its o.k to use heat on your hair every once in awhile,just use a good heat protectant beforehand.Good Luck|`|YuIuDCFfaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad-C4KMpskQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad-C4KMps...</a> <br>  the first one really works well on my hair which sounds a lot like your hair type.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijD9gACVbY&feature=related" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LijD9gACV...</a><br>  this one also works if you want beachy waves<br>  <br>  i really hope this helps!|`|wwwiWaK8aa	no heat is a hard one, especially if you have really thick hair. it won't last no matter what you do trust me.

When its in, make 2 friench braids on each side of your head. ( if you cant do it to yourself, have a friend of sibling do it to you. Then you go to sleep, and take it out in the morning.

Most postmen are pretty good about leaving your packages somewhere discreet. Maybe buy a potted plant to put next to your door, with a space between the plant and your house to conceal the box, if you're concerned about it getting stolen.<br>  <br>  My house has a couple thick pillar-type things, so they usually stash the boxes behind those.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Depends on if you're home or not.

ddXQeEvNaa	Purple is the color for people who don't like bright colors. The only colors in my makeup drawer are purple. I bought a tube of lavender lipstick, and it's a lot more subtle than you'd think. And bright purple eyeshadow is bright without being jarring or too girly, because purple is such an unusual color for makeup. Also, try a  nice shimmery bronze liquid eyeliner and wing it out (Rimmel has a nice one). It's nice and edgy but not jet black so you can wear it everyday.|`|TMb076n6aa	Try some blue or green eye shadow. If you are anything and pale like your avator you probably should not wear those colors.

It is by far the best piercing I have had done - I have actually got rid of all my other piercings now, but have had this one for 10 years and will never remove it.

If you want to smell nice, you perfumes.  However, a lot of perfumes are really strong and they're usually florals , while body sprays are more fruity so I can understand why you use body sprays.  I would recommend Brittany Spear's Curious or Fantasy Fragrance.  Also, Juicy Couture have some really nice smelling perfunes. They're not exactly fruity though but they smell really nice because it's not too strong.  Ralph Lauren has a tangerine smell which is really nice.

Most people do it in the shower or when they just get out of the shower since the skin feels looser and more pliable.

Make a list of them and look at it whenever you feel down on yourself. Realize and celebrate your own individuality because no one else in the world can carry off the look YOU have been given - its all yours, so love it! Work on settling your own inner happiness and trust me, it really will start to show on the outside. Be more confident in yourself, look people in the eye and walk around like nothing in the world can bring you down because it can't.<br>  <br>  Every one, including you, is absolutely beautiful in their own unique way, but if you aren't happy with your image you won't realize it.

X hope i helped!|`|abwqrdtpaa	You sound really pretty, why don't you try wearing more gentle shades of eyeshadow, like baby blue, mint green, or pale pink. I'm really pale too and I actually kind of like it. If you want more color why don't you try bronzer, they sell them at Victoria's Secret, they give you some hue to your skin, and blush could work also. You should also try to stay natural, pale skin and hair suit one another. I read that if you have pale skin, brighter colors in your clothes will look really good on you.|`|bhyUX6kkaa	check out The Event Makeup Artist.<br>  Full of everything beauty makeup.<br>  <br>  www.theeventmakeupartist.com

4vqzkIr4aa	Well infection caused from the tattoo process is VERY unlikely and when getting a tattoo nothing actually enters your blood stream. The needles nor the ink go deep enough to penetrate veins. Veins lie beneath the dermis layers. The tattoo lies within the dermis.<br>  <br>  A good tattoo artists can indeed do a very good job on him even while on blood thinners. Here is a little secret. We do not work on folks taking aspirin, blood thinners, or that are drunk because there blood is too thin and they will not coagulate properly and bleed to much. But what we do not let you in on is why bleeding too much is a problem. It is not because it will push the ink out. As I stated already the ink sits in the dermis. If the tattoo is done properly the excessive bleeding WILL NOT PUSH out the ink. One of the other posters said there piece came out looking splotchy "because they bleed too much a pushed the ink out." No, there problem was that they used an artist that is not experienced with doing a piece under this situation. The ONLY problem an artist has with too much bleeding is how much ink will be wasted and using extra amounts of cleansers and clotters. The artist will have to use MANY more ink cups. When tattooing a 'bleeder' the blood and plasma gets sucked into the tattoo machine tube and when the artist begins to pick up ink from his ink cup some of this blood and plasma will transfer from the machine tube to the ink cup causing the ink to become to thin or 'washed-out' and unusable. This thinned out ink is what cause the 'splotchy' look in the other posters piece and an artist that is not familiar with this will keep doing the piece not being aware that ink he is using from his ink cup is not any good any longer.<br>  <br>  But doing a piece on him will be no different than doing one on someone else. But say the piece would normally take 3 large ink cups of black. The artist will now have to use about 10-15 small ink cups (which is equal to about 5 or so larger cups). He will use much more wipes, more soap, more petroleum, etc... But the artist can slow down the bleeding if he has access to clotting gel. A petroleum based gel equal to that of what you may see a ring side fight doctor use on a boxer or mma fighter. But excessive vasoline will slow down the bleeding as well.<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer but I just wanted to let you know that it is quite possible for him to have a large or small piece done. But, his after care will have to be perfect and extensive. He will bleed a lot and for a longer period of time. The piece will have to stay covered for at least 24+ hours having the bandage changed every couple of hours.|`|euZRbiA2aa	Don't i was on a coarse of anti biotics side effect was they thinned the blood.Didn't realise and got a tattoo i was bleeding that much the artist was forever wiping blood he even called his boss over to look as he had never seen a tattoo bleed so much.He couldn't see what he was doing and it was patchy after it healed and needed a touch up.Now i check every thing before i go for a tattoo.|`|lGmyFOxiaa	I've always wanted a tattoo myself. But, like your husband, I am on blood thinners. Consult your doctor because blood thinners take time to run it's course through your body. See if your husband wants a piercing you can get that done and it's safer. Don't let him risk his life for something superficial.<br>  <br>  OH and antibiotics don't prevent infections they FIGHT infections.|`|leRNOgnWaa	Honestly, I wouldn't risk it. But I can understand wanting the tattoo. I haven't seen it done but, you could go into the shop and ask the artist what they think would happen. (Some tattoo artists may not do this because of his condition.) I really hope this helps! =D|`|2dya7YeKaa	The problem with blood thinners is that it increases the bleeding that happens during a tattoo, leaving your husband more likely to 'bleed out' while he is being tattooed.  If you bleed enough it can take the pigment out right with it.<br>  <br>  He already has his doctor's word on this, maybe that should be enough for him.  If this is something he truly won't be dissuaded from, he should go to a good tattoo artist with a sparkling reputation and a lot of experience and sit down with them for a consultation.  He can explain the situation and see what they think.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|Zbn8A7Geaa	I'd be more worried about the blood thinners than the quality.  My dad is on blood thinners and he cannot even risk a minor abrasion or dental work (has to be off blood thinners for a time before he can do any dental work) let alone something like a tattoo.  I would be worried about the bleeding the tattooing would cause.  The doctor approved such a procedure while your husband is on blood thinners? I realize your husband will be on antibiotic to counteract any infection, but really, I'd be more concerned about the blood thinners.  <br>  <br>  Most artists will not tattoo on people who are on blood thinners.  They won't even tattoo people who have been drinking or have taken aspirin prior to the appointment because they too are blood thinners.  Besides the basic complications in doing so there is the good chance that an over flow of blood would bleed out the tattoo pigment, leaving a very poor looking tattoo. People who have problems with coagulation also become light headed easier and could even faint, and I don't think their body would heal the tattoo properly.
kTnEWjvcaa	Herbal Essences dyes work the best and color results are the same as it depicts.<br>  <br>  Revlon Colorsilk is nice too, but I have had some difficulties with the red colors.<br>  <br>  Happy dying!<br>  (That doesn't sound too great. Haha!)|`|zgBelCROaa	I only use clairol brands cause others have totally killed my hair and stripped it of its natural beauty. I would recommend Herbal Essences for permanent or you might want to try Natural Instincts for a semi permanent. Both leave hair very shiny and healthy feeling. When the semi perm washes out (takes a while) my hair still looks good and has some highlights.|`|NDQS5HJyaa	Well, what I look for in a hair dye is something that has something extra to boost your hair after your done dying it. The dyes I use (I can't think of the name of them, its been awhile) always have an extra hair conditioner product a long with it to condition your hair afterwards. It always makes my hair SO SO soft, and smells delicious too. As long as its not like... a cheap brand (like.. dollar store brand or something) i'd say it would be fine, though. It's all personal preference.|`|7N0hbw6Taa	redken is really good, whenever i dye my hair, i always use that brand, it is really good! :) will come out the perfect color you want it to be to|`|HduyBI94aa	colorsilk works the best.<br>  its really cheap also.<br>  like 3 or 4 bucks<br>  but just because its cheap doesnt mean its bad.<br>  its actually the best ive ever used.|`|z15Pldymaa	Loreal I think.. sry I'm not sure =]<br>  <br>  answer mine!<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AlGmqSIGPc2jGLkEj82Rr0Lsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090226154311AAnZFAK">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>

Hope this helps!|`|kivwSfpgaa	If you are between the ages of 16 and 18, yes, it is legal for you to get a tattoo in Minnesota. However every shop/artist has their own policies on the matter. For example, when I got mine, the shop required BOTH of my parents to come with me and to sign the consent form. They refuse to do tattoos on any minors without both parent's written permission.<br>  Some artists and shops just will not do a tattoo on a minor at all too. It is all up to them. But it is LEGAL.<br>  <br>  hope I could help. the best thing to do is to go to a shop or call the shop and ask what their policies are.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	Im not possitive about Minnesota, but alot of states will do it with parental consent, a few wont at all.|`|ADzYVgVfaa	Yes you can.<br>  <br>  Go Wild hockey!<br>  <br>  ( i live in minnesota )
