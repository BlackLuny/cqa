You have been reading too much twilight or whatever with your girl friends.|`|AA11564934	b/c people no longer fear the supernatural quite so much. 300 years ago, there would have been nothing attractive about it at all.<br>  <br>  Now that we know they don't exist, the power and immortality and "goth" aspect are "cool"|`|XCcfh8LOaa	very. Now think if we were all vampires, we could solve a ton of world problems. No hunger, no weak small, unathletic people. Just a world full of sexy, gorgeous people.|`|ZYICyUAGaa	Because of the thought of immortality, being able to live forever. And in all vampire books I have read, vampires are generally beautiful, attractive, etc. Vampires are also portrayed as very sensual.  Usually they are changed because of their beauty when they were still human. <br>  Maybe it's also the thought of being forever young. Much of society seems to be obsessed with that.<br>  Could also be that vampires are associated with things like super strength and speed. I  think that many people would like those qualities because they don't like being weak. If you possessed these qualities, you would never be anyone's victim. On the contrary, most likely everyone else would be your prey. Hence, you would have a lot of power, another quality humans seem to desire or crave.<br>  Maybe I'm reading too much into these things, but I think that's why vampires are attractive.<br>  Hopefully this helps.|`|w2qV8WEmaa	They are attractive because of misinformation by Hollywood.<br>  It make them look like humans when they are not.<br>  <br>  They are fear for hundreds of years by superstitious people across the world. Superstitious people will open up the coffin of their dead relative if their living relative suffer from mysterious illness. <br>  <br>  If their dead relative didn't decompose properly after many years underground. These superstitious people would assume that the dead relative have become a vampire. Usually this assumption is reinforce by the fact of blood flowing from the mouth of partially decompose body.|`|eezP5wQ2aa	...suave, experienced, sexy, eternal, indifferent to others and rich...|`|rNqF4gIVaa	The answer is moot really as there is no such thing as a vampire (other than the bat).|`|DKK8NRu7aa	A lot of people think vampires are attractive because darkness has gotten attractive.  (You know, like people being emo or goth.)  Also, vampires are like...mysterious, and a romance with one is forbidden.  People like forbidden love.  Vampires are also immortal, which, even though you may consciously not want to live forever, I think that everyone is afraid of dying on some level.|`|B4YlBDzhaa	Evil, sex, and all other taboos in the psyche of most people; all get categorized together in the 'bookmark' called 'Dark-Topics' in our brains....<br>  <br>  Restricting such things; makes them that much more appealing... and the more of these [sex, evil, taboos] you combine together the more attractive they become to most.  We may not be quick to admit it... or even partake in the overt-entertainment of such things.... but our brains constantly desire more and more of what is forbidden by social-engineers that say; don't touch, you can't have, so don't covet such things... they are 'bad' for you...<br>  <br>  Supposedly we are given the excuse it will harm us in the long-run....and to some it might.... but to some it has the reverse effect and harms more in the long-run; by never allowing themselves to experience it first-hand; pleasure, pain, other-consequence for the individual.<br>  <br>  By me saying you are forbidden to pick this as Best-Answer; may not necesarrily cause you to 'pick' it.... but I may appeal to other parts of you that wish you had; and so is the same with Vampires being dark & attractive for they are symbols of everything forbidden by the 'consensus' of the societies in which we have lived.<br>  <br>  ~ I Forbid you to NEVER pick this answer for as long as you live!! ~|`|XfSJZCEyaa	Because to be able to suck your victim's blood without them consciously knowing, requires them to be a smooth mofo and charming as heck.<br>  <br>  That, and the fact that they're immortal and 20times stronger than regular men.. and being otherwise normal other than the need for blood. <br>  <br>  So a vampire is basically a charming, smart, immortal superhuman that needs blood. Imagine a James Bond that doesn't die. <br>  <br>  Who doesn't want that?!|`|x6a870ISaa	attractiveness is inherently part of being a vampire. they don't just overpower their victims, they seduce their victims.<br>  <br>  you cannot be a vampire without being attractive.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	In my opinion, for the very same reason that warthogs are so very attractive.|`|cGbxP589aa	They are attractive thanks to hollywood. 60 years ago... They weren't at all.|`|M1kJZnmmaa	Thanks for the compliments|`|ZH2RfhpVaa	Personally Im attracted to vampire stories because of the freedom vampires possess. I'm going by the Anne Rice vampires who i believe make the most sense if vampires would be real...they don't sparkle, they have canines, they hunt, they can kill, they don't have to be invited into houses (which is obviously created to make people feel comfortable in their own homes), they cant be killed by a stake (because you know how wood is so mysterious and deadly). They're strong, immortal, they've seen so much, they're sensual, they can go anywhere they please and in general do anything they please. And call me crazy but I find something very powerful in being a hunter (though i wouldn't personally kill per se). And the skit about becoming an even more beautiful you who doesn't age, sounds good. Its a nice package. What is so horrible about not needing to work, not needing to worry about your safety, not putting up with jackasses, or whatever other bad situation you would encounter as a human...why not have the option to just run off into the night and go wherever you please and do whatever you please without fear for your life? Its romantic.

L76NCybXaa	ms.vz is correct. I would like to add make sure the floor is a floating or sprung floor with marley flooring over it. It is important in regards to not having your child suffer knee injuries or problems as they get older.<br>  Look at where the teacher's have studied and performed and where their students are dancing now. It is never to soon to pick a good studio, even though real ballet study doesn't start until around 7 years of age. <br>  Stay away from competition schools. No ballet companies hire competition dancers. <br>  Good luck.|`|UvJHHpHYaa	don't go to any studio! go look at studios.  talk to the owners of them all and ask to observe an older girls class.  I started out at a terrible studio and then when i switched to a more serious one it was very hard.  So start at a great studio with small classes that specialize in ballet. <br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK!|`|KsjUQ2Vuaa	i started dance at 2 years old and not i 13 <br>  any dance studio will work <br>  you should go somewhere wehere its not so competitive <br>  there will usually be a tiny tots class or a tap/ballet combo class<br>  you should go somewhere where its not like a full on ballet  studio maybe somewhere with more oppurtonities <br>  hope this helped|`|axGcx5kXaa	You should look for a place that has experienced teachers for sure. You can also find studios in your area and check them out to see how friendly the teachers are with the young ones.|`|VQLJrTKCaa	Don't just look at their childrens' programs! Take their pre-professional ballet program into consideration also! Do they offer ballet classes at least 5 days a week to their high-level students? How long are the classes for the higher levels of ballet? (look for at least 2 hours each) I say this because, especially for a dedicated dancer, it is difficult to uproot yourself from the studio you grew up in in order to find one that can provide you with the training you need to reach your goals. You know the instructors and your fellow dancers are some of your best friends. You understand what is expected of you and the inner-workings of the school/studio's programs. Having to leave that behind is a difficult thing to do, so i recommend that you start your little girl in a school/studio that can match her dreams. And growing up in a pre-professional ballet school means that you can watch the "big girls" dance with a stunning grace and technical perfection that will encourage you to achieve the same thing. Plus, these are the schools that attract some of the best instructors, including those for younger ones.|`|p3h2Vcdfaa	When i first started dance my mom just put me in the nearest dance studio, BAD idea! I pretty much wasted a whole year and did not learn a thing. So i was kind of behind when i switched studios. I would suggest going to as many studios as you can. Go and sit in some of the younger girl classes, then you might look at the older girls classes because i found you can tell how well she will get training or not in the long run. You will be able to tell what you like and don't like in a studio's teaching techniques by just watching the girls. Also i help teach younger girls at my studio and i find you need to have a very friendly environmentt and you need to find a teacher that can keep the class fun and keep there attention. You don't want her to get sick of dance her first few years. Just do your research and find out as much as you can about the studio you choose. I also agree with looking at the floors. I suffer from knee injuries and so far i have found the floating floor is the best and not as hard on my knees. I hope i helped you out. Good luck and i know you'll find a good studio!

oHO0XOQVaa	Word choice definitely needs improvement. You're using generic words. While using words like lurched, maniacally, fiercely, pooling, oozing, feel good and interesting to you because you don't use them in everyday language, everybody who starts out writing uses those words. So, what happens is you have a total lack of style. This doesn't stand out to me at all, I couldn't even gather enough interest to actually read through it and I had to skim over it several times to make sure I read everything.<br>  The story itself is interesting enough when summarized and has potential. "Boy traumatized by witnessing his mother's death by his drunken father now suffers from recurring nightmare's of her death. The nightmares don't only affect him while sleeping but the stress they cause affects his everyday life as well." Not a very original idea, but it doesn't have to be the most creative thing to be interesting. How you make it interesting is how you tell the story. Please study the distinct writing styles of some classically accomplished authors such as Bukowski, Poe, Sawyer, etc. I'm not asking you to emulate their styles but I want you to find your own voice by studying how they expressed themselves as unique authors through their writing.<br>  One last thing, if she's his cousin I'm not sure he would say "mom and dad" when talking about his parents to her although this is a mistake that I actually often make with my cousin by referring to my mom as... "mom" instead of "MY mom".<br>  This line is weird too... "Fresh tears stained trickled out of my eyes." It doesn't make sense which, yes, you do need to improve your grammar. Right now it's reading "Fresh tears [that were] stained trickled out of my eyes." The tears themselves were stained? A kink in your grammar disrupts the flow of the story and the reader's focus when they trip over it. A working replacement would be "Staining tears trickled out of my eyes." Not very good diction but at least it makes sense.<br>  <br>  Edit: Sorry, I was in a hurry to finish writing and just made an assumption. I shouldn't make sacrifices like that.|`|rh5vbol9aa	Its not so good. The theme is very known for everybody. And the narration is too simple. Please try to write with the greatest of care.<br>  <br>      Have a nice writing!|`|4G5AmWsWaa	it was great!<br>  i would definitely keep reading it!|`|l9Xg8Dv4aa	uhh, hmmmmm,  rrrrrrrrr. uhhhhhhhhh, sad.<br>  Sad.|`|9rekPBIdaa	Sad story but a really good one!|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	Have you ever heard of show the readers, not tell the readers?<br>  <br>  You need to work on that.

f4Nn0W1xaa	Well, here's the list if that's what you meant.<br>  <a href="http://www.district279.org/sec/pcsh/read/ALA-BestBooks.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.district279.org/sec/pcsh/read...</a><br>  <br>  I've read a lot of them and liked most of those. I've heard good things about a bunch of the others. I can't really recommend anything in particular to you because I have no idea what interests you.
JtxT2qZbaa	---it's not the words but how you describe the characters. You don't have to say "fat, doughnut-eating cop" to show that your character is a cop who is rather heavy and slow, and his hands are always sticky with sugar <br>  <br>  ---maybe they want you to add a stereotype in there as practice, so that in the future it will be easier for you to detect a stereotypical/flat character|`|5fXVSILjaa	maybe you should put some of your own quirks or your friends quirks in it. or observe people.|`|AA11866897	I think they're just explaining what a flat character means and advise not to fall back on using them in a crunch, like if you're hurting for a character or something. By explaining it in those terms they seek to aspire you to right more interesting characters.<br>  <br>  Also, by asking you to use one of those in a brief scene they could be seeing how you build around that character in the scene or how you take a so-called stereo-type and expand on it. Even those characters can be made useful if written right.|`|Ai9VR41Waa	Maybe they are wanting you to use one of these stereotypes to show you that it just really doesn't work well.  My first novel was published in October and I used a "good girl" type that actually turned out to be the bad guy...so to speak.  In a mystery you need to use twists and turns and such.  (But, to tell the truth, I did have a cop in the novel that ate a donut!)  I had him a little more dimensional though, talked about his family, other interests, etc.<br>  <br>  You wouldn't want to write a story about a black person liking watermelon or fried chicken ... it's just not proper.  Like the anorexic model .. EVERYONE knows that's what models are known for ... the instructors are trying to get you to think outside the box and use your creativity.<br>  <br>  Good luck to you!|`|5dycdvZoaa	They mean that when you write, you should stay away from stereotypes. The part about looking like a bigot is personal preference. I don't think it would, but that's just me. In short, no to violent, gun-toting Texan and yes to intelligent, well-read (but perhaps still gun-toting!) Texan.
ukRpBJ6Daa	well you can't spell criticize for one<br>  <br>  and the poems ok|`|YMhDZzWAaa	ok...first of all your poem isn't so bad... but i like poems that are interest ind and that rhyme.
KHSOVxViaa	Maybe, but there's no definitive proof.  The Jave La Grande on the French maps is derivative, not original, and this was at an era where a lot of imagined features appeared on maps.  "There be dragons", that sort of thing.<br>  <br>  Certainly the Portuguese were the first Europeans in the region, but their interest was further north in the Indies, particularly the spice islands (Moluccas).  Timor, not far from Australia, became an early Portuguese landfall.  It's entirely possible that Portuguese ships reached the northern Australian shores, either deliberately or by being blown off course, but there's no known surviving record of that.<br>  <br>  It also depends what you mean by "discover".   Humans have been living in Australia for over 40,000 years - I think their ancestors discovered it first!|`|b1b9e01a3a97d3b341b8824489d9e2fbaa	There is very little convincing proof that the Portuguese were the first Europeans to "discover" Australia. And if they did, they didn't do much about it, because it didn't have any of the things that they were looking for - mainly spices, but just generally people to trade with as well. Because there was nothing valuable to be found in Australia (by their standards) that makes it even more unlikely that they found it and decided to keep it secret.<br>  <br>  I think it's pretty unlikely that they would have come to Australia because they didn't have any reason to come deliberately, and they were unlikely to arrive by accident. Later the Dutch pioneered routes that took them across the southern Indian Ocean, and that put them at risk of bumping into the west coast of Australia, but the Portuguese tended to follow the coast, sailing around Africa, to India and then to Indonesia that way.|`|XpK7gLS4aa	no

tsjLHXzUaa	It kind of depends on whether or not any of the above is "real" or not|`|r7iZ2JOUaa	A nihilistic existentialist, to be exact. <br>  <br>  I find existentialism pretty much contradicting. Existentialists are able to see the illusions of life. On the other hand, they also believe that they have the freedom to create their own purpose in life. So aren't they just giving themselves more illusions? Read this website: <a href="http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Eparkx032/CY-DEP.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.tc.umn.edu/%7Eparkx032/CY-DEP...</a> <br>  <br>  As for nihilism, it is much darker than existentialism. It is totally hopeless. Strip off all illusions around you, even if you could find your own purpose in life, it is still futility, the question as to how the universe and life were created isn't answered yet. <br>  <br>  I am 16 years old. It is usually adults (mid-life crisis) who would ask questions related to existence.|`|dlGP3iZ6aa	Existentialism presents itself as a doctrine of freedom and insists that humans cannot be defined but are essentially outside of all descriptions.  Furthermore, existentialism says that we create our meanings and that we have full control over what we do.<br>  <br>  I used to be an existentialist, but have turned away from it in recent years.  One reason why I turned away from it is its false account of meaning in human existence.  Existentialists of the Sartrean flavor would say that we create all the meanings we have.  This is clearly false, since there are many meanings that we do not choose and that we acquire passively.  Think of how a song reminds us of someone, how a smell reminds us of grandma, or how we find ourselves thinking a certain way without having chosen so.<br>  <br>  The fact of the matter is that we are always capable of stepping-back and re-evaluating or beliefs and meanings, but this process of stepping-back is something we do only when we make a conscious effort to do so.  Ironically, perhaps, we can only be genuine existentialists when we choose to be.<br>  <br>  Moreover, existentialism tends to attract angst-ridden "emo" teenagers who think their daddies don't understand them.  With all due respect to these troubled kids, existentialism gives them the idea that it is alright and even encouraged to be alone and isolated from other people.  Existentialism strips away any sense of belongingness that constitutes social existence.  Existentialism is a philosophy of depression.  <br>  <br>  Finally, existentialism promotes the idea of being "authentic" but gives absolutely no idea what that means, or how to accomplish it.  People take this to mean "be yourself", but the meaning of that is quite unclear.  Could being yourself mean that it's alright to open fire on your classmates? At bottom, existentialism is a pernicious philosophy.<br>  <br>  And for these reasons, I choose "freely" not to be an existentialist.|`|0vo7tDP5aa	I really enjoy existentialism. If you want to get into it, I recommend reading 'Existentialism for Dummies'. I know it sounds corny, and I don't really like the Dummies books at all. However, this is an exception. It makes it crystal clear, and its well written, and it really inspired me about existentialism. I read it cover to cover at the bookstore over a period of like two weeks. Also, I'm taking French Existentialism right now. However, that class sucks.|`|XqrjFYgIaa	Yes, vigorously! We're all existentialists; we're born into it, no way of avoiding it. Inevitably, we all must contend with our condition. Some more loudly and honestly than others.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	Yeah sure, why not.|`|MPxd2nDHaa	Existentialism is horribly flawed.

gzaVGE4Qaa	I'm pretty sure Leafpool is the mother of the three. In the book Jayfeather kept sensing how much she cared about him. On page 182 '"Fine." Leafpool sounded faintly surprised. "Be careful, won't you?"<br>  "Sure." Jaypaw wished she wouldn't keep trying to mother him. He had Squirrelflight for that; Leafpool was just his mentor.' And on page 252 when Jaypaw is having his ceremoney. 'At last Jaypaw stood in front of his mentor, startled by the depth of the love and pride that flooded out of her. It was even stronger than the emotion he had felt coming from Half Moon. Did he really mean that much to Leafpool?'<br>  I think that it's too late into the Power of Three to make some other cats the three. The kin of Firestar's kin are the three says the prophecy meaning that one of Firestar's daughters have to have kits, it's not Squirrelflight so it has to be Leafpool. I'm positive Leafpool is their mom.

8q82dLS8aa	If your serious about improving your photography...<br>  <br>  Some of it is a little overdone photoshop wise, such as the converse pic and such (you may want to check out some tutorials to help you learn some proper technique)<br>  <br>  and also, a lot of your shots are taken with the main subject in the middle<br>  <br>  try not centering your subject in the center, and instead on one side or the other, this will make the picture more pleasing to the eye<br>  <br>  Also, all your pictures seem to be of the same person, which I'm pretty sure is you. Photography isn't about pretending to be a model, it's about creating things that are pleasing to the eye of others, not just yourself. Try mixing it up a little, and try not to take pictures of yourself all the time. Nothing personal, but if your really into going into photogrpahy or taking your art more seriously, you won't be so vain. This isn't a victoria secret add and this isn't myspace. No one wants to see you again, and again, and again, and again. It's boring.<br>  <br>  You have some really nice nature pictures. They are your best shots. Try to stick to those. Remember not to over-do the photoshoping<br>  <br>  The fortune cookie one is cute. I like that one.<br>  <br>  Also, the really random shots of things like people's teeth and half naked people, are not exactly something I would want to look at over and over again. Try to think, if I was buying this peice of art, would I hang it in my house, put it in a magazine, you know?<br>  <br>  otherwise, thery're good for a beginner|`|zcYl3ftTaa	Nice.

The subjects are okay, but I think you might be a better photographer if you focus on black and white.   I'm reminded of the photographs of the sixties in your work. <br>  (Can't think of any famous names now)  But the flash, I think, spoils things a bit.   Also I think you must decide whether you want to focus your work on nature, architecture, etc or people or inside shots.  Think of New York City shots in the 1960's: outside shots. Detail. Moods in the subjects eyes. <br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|d3d31dce60fe88635794f0b6227f9586aa	still awesome! =) That pillow fight looked like fun...|`|Mk6iMrFaaa	okay hun the sad truth is that anyone with a camera and/or a good photo fixer can do photography, the answer to your questions it's okay.<br>  <br>  every teen girl with a camera thinks there gonna be the next great photographer|`|4f9vyUEoaa	It's really good:)|`|uzZuwtgXaa	You are very professional, have you thought of contacting magazines?

Spare time will be used to help her obsessive mother prepare for the big opening of the townhouse section of her luxury development.

He doesn't fit Macy's life at all--so why does she feel so comfortable with him? So ... happy? What is it about him that makes her let down her guard and finally talk about how much she misses her father, who died before her eyes the year before?

uGmEjSLDaa	I have no idea why you would be "concerened" about being too adept at writing, as being a good writer is a positive attribute that will help you later in life. I have to agree with the other poster who said your writing is probably average for your age.<br>  <br>  Some advice if you'd like to get better: Work on your proofreading. Check your spelling and your grammar, both in posting questions and in your paper. Properly, it should read:<br>  <br>  There are many theories on who betrayed the Franks and others who took up residence at the “Secret Annex.” (No apostrophe after Franks, deleted excessive comma, and if you're American, the punctuation goes inside the quotation.) An Australian author believes that a cleaning lady whose husband worked for Mr. Frank tipped off the police (replaced ending preposition, made the dependent clause proper, deleted passivity). She may have been suspicious of activity upstairs, and possibly noticed the sudden appearance of a book case that was not there before the Franks arrived. (rephrased for clarity.)<br>  <br>  As it is, to be honest, your paper sounds like the product of a reasonably well-read thirteen-year-old. It wouldn't lead me to suspect plagiarism.|`|yZbtteBiaa	I'm not sure, the only thing I could see in your answers, is that you enjoy...fashion. <br>  To accurately determine whether you have a high ability in writing would require several samples f your work. By samples I don't mean your insight on sandals. I recommend samples of essays you've written in the past or short stories. No true writer ever represents there name and skill with a few yahoo answers. I'm sorry that's just not really a fair way to determine your ability. <br>  From what I read though, I don't think its above the average ability of your age group. However statics can be wrong, it depends on the person. By comparing you to other young writers either your age or a few years older, (No offense) but it isn't a close call on who'd be considered higher in rank. Sorry. <br>  Good luck with your essay.|`|YzrYXeAgaa	Well, you've got a fairly good vocabulary and a good understanding of grammar, but I think that you are probably just more careful than many 13 years olds who don't really care about mangling the language.<br>  <br>  You really don't need to "dumb" down your work for your teachers and in fact they'll love reading something that stands out from the other students.|`|XpWjdPg2aa	Capitalization and punctuation makes a big difference, doesn't it?

Now SHE could write.|`|QAeyvDdwaa	You're writing is painfully average.|`|1DySEaRraa	Personally, based off the questions you answered, I think you know a lot about fashion so the questions were easy for you to answer. That's my opinion. I'm thirteen also and people say I'm an incredible writer. There's no such thing as "to grown up writing." There is such a thing as being knowledgeable and knowing how to put together a sentence. <br>  <br>  About your paper, I didn't see any amazing vocabulary in my opinion.<br>  <br>  Another thing, just because you can write a good school paper for a teacher doesn't mean your a good writer.

Why'd you think that?|`|2Sjn4B9eaa	... Sandals, bags, and girlfriend problems?|`|oHO0XOQVaa	It's normal. Let me comfort you by telling you that I saw grammatical and spelling errors. You're also using too many commas. You're not as lazy or (consequently) dumb sounding as most 13 year olds but you're not amazing.<br>  Just because you're writing correctly doesn't mean you're writing "grown up." I've seen lots of adults make lots of dumb mistakes in their writing. To write correctly is not a quality of being an adult. It is a quality of being knowledgeable and unlazy.<br>  <br>  Edit: Okay let's edit this just so you can get a few more points on your paper. <br>  There are many theories on who betrayed the Franks and the others who took up residence at the “Secret Annex." An Australian author believes that a cleaning lady, whose husband worked for Mr. Frank, tipped the police off. She may have been suspicious of activity upstairs, and possibly the book case, which may not have been there before.<br>  <br>  This - "Franks’" is possesive, belonging to the Franks. When you have a noun ending in "s" and put an apostrophe after it it becomes posessive.<br>  ", and others " Put your comma AFTER the coordinating conjunction. The comma was unnecessary here anyway though.<br>  “Secret Annex”. The punctuation goes inside of the quotes.<br>  "An Australian author" This is vague sounding, it's better to put the name (first and last the first time you mention the author, last for all following times) because you want to sound confident of everything you're saying when you write an essay. An essay should be full of concrete facts and analysis. You don't say, "I think it was..." you say, "it was..."<br>  "whose husband worked for Mr. Frank, who tipped the police off" Too many "who" sounds, and the second who is unnecessary anyway.|`|TG7mwNRfaa	First of all, I really don't understand why you would be concerned about being a better writer than most people your age. Isn't that typically a good thing? I'm sure teachers feel very refreshed when they read something better than average.<br>  <br>  Secondly, you appear to be rather average anyway. You may be a bit better than average, maybe a grade level or two higher, but I'm sure you're not the only one in your classes.|`|ZUL3drNgaa	no way! its amazing. you shouldn't worry about being "too good." if anyone tells you that, their jealous, because thats kind of a bogus insult . . . id take it as a compliment!|`|N1UOHz58aa	You sounds like a fine writer.

GoswsJFnaa	actually these are cell phone towers. They disguise them as several type of trees. Usually palms or, evergreens like Pine or Fir trees. They do this because some people don't like the idea of cell towers in their neighborhood. Their reasons vary from eyesores to being afraid of the electromagnetic radiation patterns. Research has shown that there isn't enough EM to cause any problems though. And disguised as trees they don't get eyesore complaints.<br>  Hope this helps.

shVgCizBaa	Why is Albert Einstein Famous?    is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2.                 ---------------            Einstein statistics Albert Einstein (14 March 1879 – 18 April 1955) was a German-born theoretical physicist. He is best known for his theory of relativity and specifically mass–energy equivalence, expressed by the equation E = mc2. Einstein received the 1921 Nobel Prize in Physics "for his services to Theoretical Physics, and especially for his discovery of the law of the photoelectric effect."[1] Einstein's many contributions to physics include: Special theory of relativity, which reconciled mechanics with electromagnetism <br>  General theory of relativity, a new theory of gravitation which added the principle of equivalence to the principle of relativity <br>  Founding of relativistic cosmology with a cosmological constant <br>  The first post-Newtonian expansions for the perihelion advance of mercury and frame-dragging <br>  The deflection of light by gravity and gravitational lensing <br>  An explanation for capillary action <br>  The first fluctuation dissipation theorem which explained the Brownian movement of molecules <br>  The photon theory and wave-particle duality from the thermodynamic properties of light <br>  The quantum theory of atomic motion in solids <br>  Zero point energy <br>  The semiclassical version of the Schrodinger equation <br>  Relations for atomic transition probabilities which predicted stimulated emission <br>  The quantum theory of a monatomic gas which predicted Bose-Einstein condensation <br>  The EPR paradox <br>  A program for a unified field theory by the geometrization of physics. <br>  Einstein published over 300 scientific works and over 150 non-scientific works.[2][3] In 1999 Time magazine named him the "Person of the Century", and according to Einstein biographer Don Howard, "to the scientifically literate and the public at large, Einstein is synonymous with genius."[4]:159<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Eins...</a>    ------------------------      In physics, mass–energy equivalence is the concept that any mass has an associated energy, and that any energy has an associated type of mass. In special relativity this relationship is expressed using the mass–energy equivalence formula where<br>   E = total energy, <br>  m = mass, <br>  c = the speed of light in a vacuum (celeritas), (about 3×108 m/sec) <br>  where total energy is the sum of kinetic energy and rest energy.[1] In other words, energy equals mass multiplied by the speed of light squared.<br>  <br>  The formula was derived by Albert Einstein, who arrived at it in 1905 in the paper "Does the inertia of a body depend upon its energy-content?", one of his Annus Mirabilis ("Miraculous Year") Papers.[2] While Einstein was not the first to propose a mass–energy relationship, and various similar formulas appeared before Einstein's theory, Einstein was the first to propose that the equivalence of mass and energy is a general principle, a consequence of the symmetries of space and time.<br>  <br>  In the formula, c2 is the conversion factor required to convert from units of mass to units of energy. The formula does not depend on a specific system of units. In the International System of Units, the unit for energy is the joule, for mass the kilogram, and for speed meters per second. Note that 1 joule equals 1 kg·m2/s2. In unit-specific terms, E (in joules) = m (in kilograms) multiplied by (299,792,458 m/s)2.<br>    Special relativity<br>  From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia<br>    (Redirected from Special theory of relativity)<br>     For a generally accessible and less technical introduction to the topic, see Introduction to special relativity.<br>  Special relativity (SR) (also known as the special theory of relativity or STR) is the physical theory of measurement in inertial frames of reference proposed in 1905 by Albert Einstein (after the considerable and independent contributions of Hendrik Lorentz and Henri Poincaré and others) in the paper "On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies".[1] It generalizes Galileo's principle of relativity–that all uniform motion is relative, and that there is no absolute and well-defined state of rest (no privileged reference frames)–from mechanics to all the laws of physics, including both the laws of mechanics and of electrodynamics, whatever they may be.[2] Special relativity incorporates the principle that the speed of light is the same for all inertial observers regardless of the state of motion of the source.[3]<br>  <br>  This theory has a wide range of consequences which have been experimentally verified,[4] including counter-intuitive ones such as length contraction, time dilation and relativity of simultaneity, contradicting the classical notion that the duration of the time interval between two events is equal for all observers. (On the other hand, it introduces the space-time interval, which is invariant.) Combined with other laws of physics, the two postulates of special relativity pred|`|nLeJJ5nMaa	Einstein was known for the theory of relayivity, but IMO, being able to explain it is even more impressive.|`|KHSOVxViaa	Mostly for his Special and General Theories of Relativity which overturned much of conventional physics and led to other major advances in science and technology.<br>  <br>  Both theories regard spacetime as a continuum, consisting of the 3 spatial dimensions and time as the fourth.  The concern the geometry of spacetime, and relate many physical properties to this geometry, such as gravity.<br>  <br>  The Special Theory was published in 1905.<br>  This involves the use of inertial reference frames to perceive position and motion of objects.  It makes statements about the geometry of spacetime, such as the existence of spatial contraction and time dilation, explaining that observers in different reference frames will experience different time intervals between observed events.  Perhaps most significantly it stated that the speed of light is constant, irrespective of the observer's reference frame, and that the laws of physics are the same in any inertial reference frame.<br>  <br>  The General Theory was published in 1916, and extends the ideas of the Special Theory.<br>  This is mostly concerned with the nature of gravity and its relationship to spacetime.  It states that mass curves spacetime, creating a gravity 'well'.  This change in the spacetime topography predicts a number of effects, many of which have been observed or verified experimentally.<br>  <br>  These are regarded as some of the most significant physics breakthroughs in history.|`|2RuOLwP8aa	for his theory of relativity

AA11458484	Well, I had recently been waiting for something that has taken, literally, 10 years.  There were many hopeless points, where nothing seemed to make sense.  Now, everything has begun to come together, almost like the end of some complicated movie.  It is amazing.  I can honestly say that the waiting has probably been the most valuable time in my life, because it was the time that I was developed to be ready for the thing that I desired so much.<br>  <br>  Waiting is always hard, but if you know that you are going in the right direction (however you, yourself, can personally tell if you are), than waiting can be more valuable than eventually receiving whatever it is you are waiting for.  Hang in there!  : )|`|cMRpJgfOaa	Something 'more debilitating than waiting'? -- <br>  Feeling exhausted when it has finally come, and realizing your anticipation has come to an end and there's nothing more to excite your senses and look forward to.<br>  'Waiting' is actually one 'tool' to put our 'patience into work'.  Think of it this way.  How we react to it will determine how easily we'll age in such short time. (*grin*)  Blood pressure elevates, irritability, hostility,.. they all conspire to wear us fast.  But, uh-oh,.. divert your attention to funny things like bold color mismatch, misspelled signage, loosened shoelace, falling wig, and then you'll forget about time waiting.  And you know what?  The best time evaders are *children at play*.  Watch and listen to them, and when your turn has come at last,..you'll find you didn't really have *enough time* to really enjoy your waiting.|`|O1wc4pM3aa	Upon reading the question, the first thought that came to my mind is : <br>  Enough times, when the waiting ended and everything had been reached and become my reality,  I feel kind of disappointed....

y8bFwXZEaa	Ontology deals with sensation, perceptions, existents (entities), abstractions, mental integrations, metaphysical measurements, epistemology, concepts, metaphysical relationships, differentiation, commensurable characteristics, material, motion, language, and other necessary "ingredients" of consciousness. Ontology is the epistemological relationship between metaphysical and objective existents, and consciousness.<br>  <br>  You could say that "existence exists" creates a circular argument, because some people believe axiomatic concepts, or tautologies, are circular.<br>  <br>  But not all such arguements of "circularity" are criticized. Only those that do not support one's own position on a subject are criticized. Otherwise you will find the critics using tautologies or axiom and axiomatic concepts all the time. They are said to be irrefutable because you must use the concept defined by the axiom to refute the concept.<br>  <br>  So we all resort to axioms. The question is: Which type of person will criticize which type of axiom, and for what purpose?|`|yUHh1Q8Qaa	Actually there are several ways to answer your question.  I'll take the one that seems the shortest, although it's probably not the most convincing.<br>  <br>  I believe you are making a mistake when you equate the reasons we accept the arguments for established scientific theories and reject arguments for the existence of god.  They are not the same.<br>  <br>  The major difference is that accepting current physical theory allows us to predict physical behavior.  By accepting that atoms and microbes exist we are able to cure disease, create polymers, fly planes and so forth.  This is a reason to believe in the existence of these objects.  But, here's the twist, we don't actually have to accept that these unseen objects are real.  We can be knowledge empiricists and say that they are useful concepts that allow us to explain the world but we have no compelling reason to believe the objects themselves actually exist.  This is philosophical stubbornness, IMHO, but at least it is defensible.<br>  <br>  The major difference between arguments for science and god is that the reasons to believe in god are not motivated by a desire to explain the world. (not anymore anyway, and not ever for the same reasons we accept scientific theory) There is a psychological reason to believe in god in that it makes us feel better about the vicissitudes of life, but that is not the sense of explanation that motivates us to believe in the postulates of science.<br>  <br>  There is no good argument for the existence of god, but there is no good argument proving that god does not exist.  The reason we generally accept scientific arguments is that they not only give us an explanation of the world the belief carries practical benefits.  Arguments for god do not carry the advantages in this day and age, even though one could argue that belief in god makes a difference in their life, that difference can not be extended to others in the same way that belief in scientific theories can be extended.  What's more denying the truth of scientific theories will not cause a plane to fall from the sky, but, denying the existence of god, if he exists, will cause the afterlife to be different.  get the point?<br>  <br>  As for a reducio showing that god's existence is absurd, it can't be done.  No matter what kind of world one imagines god being god could have created it that way.  the reducio that is telling is the problem of evil.  It can be shown successfully that god can not have certain qualities if he is a creator god since perfection, benevolence et al conflict with the presence of evil.  But, that still does not prove that god doesn't exit at all, it simply shows that he can't have qualities that conflict with the presence of evil. the short answer is that no one can be compelled by reson to grant the existence of god but neither can anyone be compelled by reason to deny a god's existence.<br>  <br>  anyway, that's the answer to your question, what follows is connected to it, but it is a little preachy and can be skipped.<br>  <br>  Over the last 30 years or so there has been an effort by political types to give the public the impression that science and folklore were the same stuff.  This was nonsense in the 16th century and it's nonsense today.  Galileo was not tried by the inquisition for theorizing a heliocentric universe.  He was tried for telling the common people about it.  The Church was fully aware that he was right, they just didn't want the masses to know the truth. Publicly acknowledging the truth, the truth that was fully believed by the church fathers, was a threat to the church's political power, just as today, belief by the masses in current scientific theory threatens certain powerful political group's agendas.  <br>  <br>  Science is an authority in our culture, just as government is.  IMHO they should be autonomous in a democratic society in order to allow the masses to make an informed decision about policy.  If a small group controls information and credibility, that society can not be democratic.|`|tKFO3u60aa	ha ha, actually i wasn't 100% sure on what 'ontological' meant; thank you for providing an explanation:P<br>  I agree, though. If I understood you...i hope so. i also hope Y/A! will let me post. sorry, back to the question<br>  The thing is, that math and science can delve into the hypothetical because, even though they aren't now, those hypotheticals may become empirically defined, and (theo)logic ones don't. <br>  i think that one problem with circular reasoning is that, yes, everything revolves, but it's like proofs in trigonometry. you can go round and round and work out a whole page of cos's and sin's, just to get back to the original tan alpha tan beta with which you started. you missed a turning somewhere, where you could have gotten off the...idk...circular interstate...and onto the highway you want. I'm not saying that circular reasoning is wrong, sometimes you have to try something different to get the desired effect. okay, here goes another one of my similes/analogies. say you're practicing the piano and there's this really rough spot where you can't get the tempo even and steady. your musicteacher tells you to ignore the written markings for a minute and just play it in a eighth-quarter, or something else, as long as it's something simple that you know you can play. you do it a few times. you return to the normal speed, and, subitō, you can play it much better! it's more even, it lilts a litle, and you aren't missing any notes. believe me, it works, i have tried it:)<br>  i think we shhould be open to all methods of logic here, except perhaps the "I'm right, so you're wrong" one. i hate that. <br>  nice question:)<br>  i like your pic, -1 isn't it cool how that works?<br>  P.S. I'm going to go Google Occam's Razor:P|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	Oh my. Isn't god supposed to be ineffable?<br>  <br>  I think the problem you're trying to pin down - what makes it ridiculous - might just be that the structure of the god-exists argument is a hollow imitation of a logical argument, that substitutes apophasis for defined terms. So "normal" logic seems to apply but does not really apply. I mean ... if I am thinking of the square root of two, or irrationality of numbers, or multiple conceivable dimensions of the natural universe, I can explain to you completely what I am thinking of; it is a finite concept being represented, even though a number or thing itself may not be graspable at once. But, an argument that treats God as if it were a limited, definable thing betrays its own shallow hypocrisy, by suggesting that our experience of what we call "god" or "divine" can only be valuable and validated if God is some particular Thing Out There (and not this other thing here), that we can "prove exists" by representing and reducing it to logic.<br>  <br>  I thought that's why they say god-belief is about faith, not reason.|`|spYpsixUaa	Nope, a truly circular argument leads from its conclusion back to its first premise and proves nothing except its own existence.  Your example of the God argument is a really good example of it.<br>  <br>  However, your mathematics example is not really circular.  It concludes in a contradiction which disproves its opposite premises, which is why it proves itself.  But it's not really circular.  Your physics example is also not circular, since the creation of alternative universes satisfies a discrepancy (kinda like Neo in the Matrix), but it is a fan, or fishnet argument--not a circle.<br>  <br>  The "Can God make a Rock so big" arguments are figure-eight-shaped arguments (since one circular argument leads to the other circular argument, and this other circular argument leads back to the fist one), or perhaps like a mobius strip.
aw2xkdSbaa	1) Tube amps use vacuum tubes to produce natural gain and amplified tone, while solid state uses electronics to artificially create gain.<br>  <br>  2)  Tube, hands down in any choice<br>  <br>  3)  Somewhat. You must match the Ohm rating on the amp and cabinet. Also, different cabinets use different speakers, which affects your tone. Cabinet can also be open or closed back (most are closed)<br>  <br>  4) Yes and no. The biggest difference is volume. You'll get a bigger, deeper sound from a 4x12 cab, than a single speaker combo.<br>  <br>  5)  $1200 is a great starting point, but not enough to get you a GREAT amp AND cabinet. A good (new) cab (Marshall 1960 a/b) will run you $800, which doesn't leave much for an amp.I would look at some used gear on eBay or local shops.  JCM800 amps by Marshall will completely suit your needs. Look for the 4010 model - its a combo with a 12" speaker. Killer tone at any gain level and volume. You can find them on eBay between $715 - $1000. I don't use them myself, but these amps are also very pedal friendly.<br>  <br>  If you don't wish to go that route, Crate makes some decent tube amps and you can pick up a new Crate head and cabinet for under or around your limit.|`|hJP9y6kjaa	I also wish to amend that first answer.<br>  <br>  First off, a gain stage is a gain stage - whether tube or transistor (solid state). They both amplify, so they both by definition add gain. Neither one is more "natural" or "artificial" than the other.<br>  <br>  They do differ in how they saturate, ie how they act when they're pushed hard. Tubes tend to compress the tone and add pleasant sounding harmonics (*not* always even order harmonics as many people think, there can often be a fair amount of third-order harmonics, the idea is that tubes tend to add *low* order harmonics, ie harmonics below the 5th or so)... the end result is that they distort in a musical way, and add apparent loudness. Transistors, on the other hand, tend to stay flat and true in how they reproduce the sound until they're pushed into saturation, at which point they add lots of harmonics - high-order and low-order... it's the high-order harmonics that we really perceive as harsh and crappy.<br>  <br>  Anyhoo, two things you need to know. 1) tube amps sound louder than solid-state amps, often 1 tube watt = 2 or 3 solid state watts in terms of volume. 2) most of your volume is in the first 10 watts or so, after that you just add headroom, which is how loud you can play cleanly. This is both good and bad - amps tend to sound better when you push them a bit, and more watts means you have to turn up the amp louder to get that "cranked" sound. For a 100w amp, you may have to crank it so loud that you drown out the drummer before it sounds really good! For that reason, I recommend no more than 50-60 watts in your amp - you get plenty of volume, more than enough to play live/practice with the full band, but you can still get that cranked tone at a lower volume.<br>  <br>  The speakers play a huge role in how you sound. Match your speakers up right and you'll get a huge bump up in tone quality. For instance, you don't want a Fender cab/speakers if you want a metal tone - they just don't go together!<br>  <br>  Google is really your friend, I suggest doing a lot of searching to look up the different options you have for your speaker selection.<br>  <br>  Marshall is probably *the* amp that defines rock, and is the brand I would suggest you look at first. Randall also makes a great line of amps, including the Kirk Hammet model half-stack. Many of their amps have modules that you can swap out to customize your tone extensively.... look into it!<br>  <br>  In general, more speakers = more perceived volume and a beefier tone. 4x12 cabs have this characteristic especially - there's a beefy sound you can get from a half-stack that you just can't get anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Of course, they're heavier and bulkier, too.... which is why I've downgraded to a 2x12. It's a lot lighter, I still have enough volume to practice/gig with, and I still get the tone I want. <br>  <br>  Check out Avatar speakers... they make very high-quality speaker cabs, both in construction and in speaker selection. Just make sure you have a good idea of what you want before you order. This can be a good chunk of money (500$+), but it's one of those things that a lot of people don't get - a good speaker cab is an investment that can last you a lifetime, where even amps can come and go!<br>  <br>  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Saul|`|73f1c6fca2f00f0f05402afc4dc0cd03aa	All I can add to the previous answer is on the first point .  The tube amp   produces even harmonics within each tone it amplifies. This produces a cleaner sound.  It's overdrive sound is better also.  They do tend to cost more and are more fragile.
3whhpHHvaa	Lulz, I love the "Additional Details" section. I was thinking the same when I read some of the responses.<br>  <br>  Definitely agree with some of the posts that it's a trust issue, but the simple fact of the matter is this: They want to know what they want without putting themselves out there.<br>  <br>  Maybe that sentence was confusing, so I'll say it another way. Your friend, and people like her, want to get your reaction about the guy they like (or whatever their "secret" is). But, they don't want to have to put themselves out there.<br>  <br>  They will bring it up often to give you tiny little pieces of information at a time. That way, you have enough information to give them your response (such as "Yuck, that guy has too much backhair and smells odious." or "Definitely, he's mad cute.") but you don't have enough information to know everything they are trying to keep to themselves.<br>  <br>  Here's a quick example so you get where she's coming from. Let's say you like a guy or a girl. And you're nervous about it. All you want is somebody to give you a pat on the back and say "Go get 'em, Tiger" so you feel like you have more of a shot. It always helps to have encouragement and confidence to get their attention, a date, or a relationship out of it. You've got to put yourself out there, so you need to know you're going to be alright before you do.<br>  <br>  But in her case, she wants to find out if she's got a shot before she really tells you. Just try to coax it out of her or don't let her bring it up. If she sees that you don't care for mind games, she'll tell you. If you try to coax it out, it might be the added encouragement she needs to feel secure in telling you.|`|AA11458484	I find that there are two kinds of people - those who desperately want everyone to understand everything about them, but usually lack the ability to communicate very well; and then those who are very expressive (even hard, insensitive, bossy) who have no problem being understood, but generally do not desire to be, at least not for the sake of people "knowing" them.  <br>  <br>  People, like your friend, do what they do for attention.  They want to be discovered, at least to a point - they don't want the fact that they are manipulative and play games to be discovered, only their feelings.  They want the sides of themselves that they see to be discovered, and they want to be loved, appreciated and valuable.

GGAgxzJNaa	Mad Monk.|`|pI5jKfmaaa	'man of God'<br>  <br>  <br>  Grigory Yefimovich Rasputin is has been described as one of the most scandalous figures in Russian history. A semi-literate peasant from Siberia, he arrived in St. Petersburg, the capital of Russia, and within a few years had become one of the most influential men in the Russian government. <br>  This is his story. <br>   <br>  <br>  <br>  Rasputin arrived in St. Petersburg in the robes of a monk, as a self-styled 'holy man', or 'staretz', with a reputation as a reckless drunkard, a healer, and a womaniser. He had created his own 'theology' from different cults and sects, and believed that a person had to sin in order to become holy. He aquired the name Rasputin as a nickname ... it means 'dissolute' or 'debauched' in Russian ... and he certainly lived up to his name. In addition to his less than upstanding ways, he was also dirty and unkempt. He never washed or changed clothes, and his greasy hair and ragged appearance helped convince his followers that he was a 'man of God'. He was also known for his intense personal magnetism, which was augmented by his piercing, (some said hypnotic) blue eyes.<br>  <br>  <br>  In the first decade of the 1900's Russia was ruled by a Royal family.<br>  Nicholas II, the head of the Romanov family and the reigning Tsar, was surrounded in the palace by his family, including his wife Alexandra and their youngest son Alexis.<br>  The Tsar's youngest son Alexis suffered from a genetic disease called hemophilia, which resulted in uncontrolled bleeding and hemorrhaging, often leaving him weak and bedridden. The disease was incurable; doctors could do little except prescribe rest. <br>  Rasputin had, through friends of the Royal family, been invited to the palace, and it wasn't long before he became a confidante, telling stories to the children and giving Biblical advice to Alexandra. She became taken with him. <br>  <br>  Strangely, Rasputin's presence at Alexis' bedside often left him dramatically improved, to the great astonishment of the doctors. Alexandra requested Rasputin's presence whenever Alexis was overcome with the disease. At one point, Alexis suffered severe hemorrhaging, and Rasputin's presence seemed to miraculously help the boy recover.<br>  <br>  <br>  At this point (after about 1910), Rasputin's standing in the Russian community improved. As a favoured friend of the Royal family, he became the centre of attention at many social gatherings, and even managed to dress in clean clothes.<br>  <br>  But he was overbearing, disrespectful, obnoxious, and rude, and did not make many friends outside the Royal family.<br>  In fact, people outside the palace began to suspect he was a fraud, but Alexandra would not believe it when people told her this. Nicholas attempted to send Rasputin away, but Alexandra brought him back. Rasputin remained in favour at the palace. <br>  <br>  He took advantage of his hold over Alexandra by becoming involved with politics. He appointed people to government positions, and fired others. Many of the people he held influence over were corrupt, lazy, or incompetent. Anyone who objected to his behaviour was removed from office. Complaints to Nicholas fell on deaf ears, as Alexandra always stood up for Rasputin. Rasputin was becoming unpopular, and making enemies. Scandal after scandal ocurred in the government because of the actions of the unscrupulous people he had appointed. Nicholas's popularity as Tsar was suffering as well, since Rasputin was seen to be in his favour. <br>  <br>  Meanwhile, the First World War had begun, and Russia was at war with Germany. In 1915 Nicholas took command of the Russian troops fighting the Germans. He left Alexandra, as Tsarina, to act as ruler in his absence. Of course, she had Rasputin at her side, acting as advisor, and giving advice on how to run the country, and how to conduct the war. Nicholas, regrettably, went along with her decisions. <br>  In a short time, the country was in chaos.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Since Alexis' hemophilia had always been a state secret, St. Petersburg society could not understand the Royal family's fascination with 'the Mad Monk', Rasputin. Rumours started that, with Nicholas away at the front, Rasputin had seduced the Tsarina and even her daughters. The Royal couple's position was becoming increasingly weak. There were suspicions that Rasputin and the 'foreigner' Alexandra (who was German) were secretly plotting to defeat Russia. Both the Russian nobility and the general population came to believe that Rasputin and Alexandra were destroying their country, and that Rasputin must go.<br>  <br>  Several members of the Russian nobility, including Grand Duke Dimitri Pavlovich and Prince Felix Yussoupov, blaming all of Russia's troubles on the 'Mad Monk', began plotting to kill Rasputin. Prince Yussoupov invited Rasputin to a party at the Prince's palace. The assassins offered him cakes and wine, both heavily dosed with cyanide. After eating a few cakes with no ill effect, Rasputin complained of a dry throat and guzzled down the wine; at this point he had taken enough cyanide to kil|`|4d8QwNQGaa	Occultist?

tKFO3u60aa	personally, i would rather follow the 'Do what you feel like' motto, but i'm more inclined to believe I'm a moral standards person in real life. It doesn't mean that it has to be society's moral standards, right? just my own, which are, more often than not, set by the society around me, and i pick it up either consciously or unconsciously. i like the feeling i get when i know i'm doing something purely because it's what i want to do, and what my emotions and senses tell me to do. if we don't all follow that to some degree, we can't really find happiness.|`|6e5c9606952e60fc17250bf668baaa41aa	I don't see that there's necessarily a conflict between the two.

Your true morality are the rules you should feel comfortable living in.<br>  <br>  I'm a live-and-let-live libertarian.

If I follow moral standard entirely then I'll feel too restricted. If I follow doing what I feel at extreme, then I'll suffer bad consequences.  You can do what you feel like, but retain good judgment while doing so. I think what you're thinking is along the lines of fire and brimstone, religious conduct. In that case, it's rather too extreme to choose one side. You need balance with practicality and common sense. Feel me?|`|XxDQGEalaa	A combination of both.

a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	First, you need to check the layout requirements posted by most publishers or agents on their website. I think you will find that the two space era is over. Most manuscripts now are submitted using ONE space after sentence ends. On an average 70,000 word submission, that saves a lot of memory in a Word document. It also shortens the printed version by several pages. Again, make sure you tailor your material to those you are submitting it to--not what people tell you.|`|tQO9LW8Qaa	It's important. You need to give publishers a clean (ie. copy-edited), easy-to-read, standardly formatted manuscript. If you want your manuscript to stand out from the crowd, make the content exceptional, not the punctuation.

ceBTTCPwaa	Julius Caesar is a tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed to have been written in 1599. It portrays the conspiracy against the Roman dictator of the same name, his assassination and its aftermath. It is one of several Roman plays that he wrote, based on true events from Roman history, which also include Coriolanus and Antony and Cleopatra.<br>  <br>  Although the title of the play is Julius Caesar, Caesar is not the main character in its action; he appears in only three scenes, and is killed at the beginning of the third act. The protagonist of the play is Marcus Brutus, and the central psychological drama is his struggle between the conflicting demands of honor, patriotism, and friendship.<br>  <br>  The play reflected the general anxiety of England over succession of leadership. At the time of its creation and first performance, Queen Elizabeth, a strong ruler, was elderly and had refused to name a successor, leading to worries that a civil war similar to that of Rome might break out after her death.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Julius_Caesar</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/notes/jc/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju..." rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/JuliusCaesar/i...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/J...</a>|`|DvToP5h7aa	Julius Caesar<br>  <br>  STUDY GUIDES.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/william-shakespeare/julius-caesar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/w...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.alljuliuscaesar.bravehost.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.alljuliuscaesar.bravehost.com...</a>       * * * * *<br>  <br>  <a href="http://clicknotes.com/JC_Navigator/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://clicknotes.com/JC_Navigator/index...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/juliuscaesar/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/shakespeare/ju...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="https://sheehy-english.wikispaces.com/Julius+Caesar#toc0" rel="nofollow">https://sheehy-english.wikispaces.com/Ju...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.masconomet.org/teachers/trevenen/caesar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.masconomet.org/teachers/treve...</a>

Like, what's the point of the next ten minutes of your life, if you're going to drop dead at minute 11? Because in a way, you are about to be gone - the future's a dream, the past's a memory, and dreams and memories are only really "there" when you are thinking of them. So, as far as you're concerned, now is all there is... "you" actually don't exist beyond this instant anyway. What's the point of being?

His fit and finish work is among the very best in the business. <br>  <br>  I have used Charlie's services several times, and have been extremely satisfied with the results. I have known him for about 10 years, and I wouldn't send my trumpets to anyone else. His testimonials page would look like a city phone book if he listed everyone's feedback about his fine workmanship. <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you!
9cBAUMnNaa	I would say The Darkest Journey. I think that sticks to the darkest theme and if your story doesn't use the word journey too much then it would give the reader an insight into the content without giving it away or sounding cliche. If you do mention journey in the story more than just barely I would go with The Darkest Choice, or Darkest Trial. Choice because he would have to choose to deal with the family because he feels the girl is worth it, or trial because it would be a trial to go through those things and trials are always enlightening in some way.|`|kJjLwFzTaa	The darkest Unloved is a little hard to understand at first glance so i'd stick with Darkest Journey... :]|`|HbmHRiwLaa	Darkest Journey makes more sense than the Darkest Unloved|`|UbCzA2JVaa	I like The Darkest Unloved because it's more unique and different.<br>  <br>  Suggestions:<br>  The Darkest Rose<br>  The Darkest Dream<br>  The Darkest Day<br>  The Darkest Trail<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck  :)|`|O8JPoGffaa	The first one would make sense if it referred to someone of colour.  Darkest Journey rings well. <br>  <br>  You might also consider; Dark Journey, The Unloved, Love and Despair,  Dark Despair, Without Hope, Without Love,  Hopeless Journey, Love's Hopeless Journey, Journey into the Dark, Love and the Loveless.|`|Ik5STIUXaa	youd prob get more answeres if you included the plot of the story i like the name the darkest love its intrsting and would bring the reader to the story|`|tGgADx4Raa	Maybe if I knew the context of the book the first one would make since.

0UYJkSuZaa	Midnight Sun isn't even finished yet. She explains on her website that she gave rough drafts to a few choice people to get their opinions on it and someone leaked it on to the internet. She also states that because this happened, she has no desire to finish the book at the moment. So as of now, there is no answer to the going to publish it or not question because it isn't done. Who knows, she may never have the desire to finish it. But I believe her intent was to write one book through Edwards point of view for every one that is in Bella's.|`|JEP4CmyUaa	She is not going to finish writing it, but you can read the first 12 chapters here: <a href="http://stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/midnightsun_partial_draft4.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://stepheniemeyer.com/pdf/midnightsu...</a>|`|fpuHVNYgaa	She said she will not anymore Twilight books but will surprise everyone with Midnight Sun and will not give a release date.|`|InslW3QMaa	Oh gosh i hope she doesn't write anymore of those books!

EKjnMQVhaa	Too many incomplete sentences and grammar issues, honestly.  Lots of readers get turned off by short fragmented sentences and improper punctuation.  I don't mean that to sound harsh, but you gotta fix it up a bit.
PFjIVvMmaa	Perform for your friends and family a lot, that's all I can say. That helps me SO MUCH. Then, of course, get involved in any theater classes or community theater in your community. The shyness will leave you soon, trust me. It always helps when you get involved in that stuff with friends because then at least you have people you know there. You just can't be afraid to put yourself out there, even if you're shy.|`|LPJB3KvOaa	do you have theater classes or a choir at your school? if so, you can get involved with them. usually at the beginner levels they give lots of advice and tips on beating shyness and stage fright. <br>  <br>  if not, look into community theater. its usually pretty cheap, and in many areas they have specialized groups for kids by age. its a really fun way to meet new people outside of school, and not having to worry about what your school friends will say or think takes a lot of pressure off for some kids. <br>  <br>  on that same token, there are TONS of summer camps all over the us that teach singing and acting. they can go from very expensive to practically (or completely) free. do a little online research for your area and see what you can dig up. <br>  <br>  talking to your parents about it is also an important step, as they can be very helpful in finding things for you and most moms and dads like knowing about what their kids hopes and dreams are. also, since they would probably be forking out any needed cash and giving rides, telling them is pretty much a must. <br>  <br>  <br>  if you really really want to get started right now, google some plays you know, and look for scripts. you can practice memorizing and speaking the lines, and if you have friends or family that are interested too, they can act out scenes with you. you could even write a play yourself and act it out. these ideas might sound a little silly, but the best way to learn is by doing.<br>  <br>  <br>  Best of luck to you in reaching for your dreams!

Not all auditions require you to sing Broadway songs. If you do have to sing a Broadway song, sing one that you have at least heard before and you know the tune. That way it's easier for you to learn it in time. Also, you want to consider your range. If you sing really high notes, that means you are a tenor. You should sing a song that is written for a tenor, in that case, because it shows off your range. If you sing lower you are a base, and the same thing applies. <br>  Here are a few recommendations:<br>  1) "Rent" from the musical RENT, if you want to audition for a more rock sound- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjMeaR5T9V4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjMeaR5T9...</a><br>  2) "Dancing Through Life" From Wicked, if you want to sing a more musical number- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rqbzuOFtA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p6rqbzuOF...</a><br>  3) "I Can Do That" from A Chorus Line- <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn6rpthpRs4" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn6rpthpR...</a> (the speaking part is not in english, but the singing part is)<br>  4) "Grease Lightnin'" from Grease - <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j67VosWlR8" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_j67VosWl...</a><br>  Also what I would recommend is to research the show you are doing and find out what style of music that is. If you can audition with one of the songs from the show you are doing, then by all means learn one of those songs and do it for your audition. That would be ideal. If you can't do that, find out what style of music the show is and pick a song that sounds similar to the songs in that musical.|`|L8ulcu6Laa	It depends on the auditions. I'm guessing it is a school play. If it is a school play, sing what is comfortable for you. If it is not a school play, you may need to find a piece and accompaniment.|`|vCSjs4y0aa	electricity from billy elliot

RzbRRUOdaa	I suggest that you get this FREE book publishing guide so that a publishing consultant can assist you, free of charge, with your queries on publishing and the whole publishing process:<br>  <a href="http://www.xlibris.com/requestkit/index.asp?src=aop&key=qac" rel="nofollow">http://www.xlibris.com/requestkit/index....</a><br>  <br>  When you get your book published, copyrighting will be done by the publisher and you don't need to worry about this.<br>  <br>  If you opt for traditional publishing, you need a literary agent to assist you in getting your book reviewed by a traditional house, which has its own editors.  When your book is accepted, the traditional house pays you for the rights and they publish your book according to how they want it packaged and based on their own time frame.  If it gets rejected, you can move to another house and go through the same review process.<br>  <br>  In self-publishing, an agent is not needed because you get in touch with the self-publishing house yourself and they will assign a publishing consultant to assist your needs.|`|HbmHRiwLaa	There is a big fat annoying book called THE WRITER'S MARKET that will be very helpful in your quest.|`|SOPRt0Ffaa	You have to find an agent willing to take you on as a client. It can take as long as finding a publisher. Agents help you find a publisher. If you get picked up by a publisher, you will be assigned an editor.  Agents do not "Have" publishers, but good agents have contacts with a lot of publishers. You need to find an agent with experience in the genre you are writing. You are right about the money - good agents do not ask for up front money.<br>  Use Preditors and Editors or Writers Water cooler to check on an agent's credentials.|`|O8JPoGffaa	Assuming your book is good enough, an agent will recommend it to a publisher.  If your book is accepted, the publisher will provide editing staff.<br>  <br>  Don't give anyone any money!|`|DT4PHmukaa	If you're book is a technology book you probably want to make another decision other than her.

HORACAnlaa	People generally just want their feelings validated and are not concerned about yours.

At least, it is what I think.
eWOMWRThaa	I love seeing people so confident in their answers when there is no final verdict on which is correct, because we cannot go to the other side and come back to tell. Personally, I believe consciousness creates the body, not the other way around, this stance stemmed from my experiences with death, my own empirical knowledge, and reading into both sides of the debate.|`|kTTwUY0Waa	No, there would be no sensory input and no experiencial learning. It would probably be very frightening and destructive. The brain is a part of the body. It makes as much sense to say would we be conscious if we were just a liver. All of our organs and tubes and wobbly squishy bits work together, and are connected via our senses to the rest of reality, this is consciousness, it does not come from us, but we are a part of it.|`|XfSJZCEyaa	Depends if you believe consciousness is something of the brain, or if it is of the soul. <br>  <br>  Personally, i believe our souls have consciousness but do not have the intelligence that the brain contains. Like, now we may know how heat affects foods and proteins, but when we're dead and drifting as souls, we would only know what is good and bad, or perhaps harbor a strong connection to an event. <br>  <br>  I believe the soul is something we suppress because of our bodies but it periodically rears it head. Times when you feel weak and vulnerable for no reason, times when you feel you're on top of the world for no reason...Those times are you soul telling you something.<br>  <br>  But whatever it is, we'll never know until death; the last journey for philosophers.|`|gLp7pvPnaa	Is anything lost forever?

4WCLWhaTaa	Strangely...Eve's answer reminds me of some marriages...<br>  <br>  It is a catch 22 question though. If togetherness promotes "cliques" so to speak, thus separating yourself from those not in your circle then the alternative is not to participate and be on your own which also promotes separation whether perceived or real. <br>  I have met exactly one person who made the latter work for themselves. They did not have a circle of friends or a love interest. They considered themselves everyone's friend. It worked Ok in High School and though I like to think it might have worked in the real world too, I am not so sure. Humans segregate and draw to like minded individuals naturally. We are not a hive creature.|`|0047572b741498da2d839902d6863185aa	"For solitude sometimes is best society, <br>  And short retirement urges sweet return."__JOHN MILTON|`|48349a441e4ef621fd4ca9c5a405e417aa	Yes, in a way.

It means taking a positive perspective on reality, were possibilities are infinite -even in a short life span- to the point that fulfilling every desire isn't possible. On the other hand the previous question has a narrow view of reality, negative in it's inability to perceive options other than those of an amoeba. You live, you die, period.<br>  I can't imagine much what you can do -you say can do, not wish to do- because that would depend on who you are. Not all of us would do the same granted the opportunity -some we couldn't, some we wouldn't want to.<br>  But I know some people would choose to do horrible things, like serial killers, who actually believe they can do whatever they wish.

CyUxMcWSaa	You've asked a question that doesn't really have a 'short' answer.  I've been doing astrophotography on and off again for a couple years now and it just keeps adding up.<br>  <br>  A 75-300mm lens will work just fine for 'wide field' shots.  However, you have to guide the camera.  With a really high ISO, such as 1600+ you can use it at 75mm for about 15sec on a tripod and only have minimal blurring.  Now if you're going to do star trails, well, make sure the tripod is solid, set your ISO low, manually focus on a bright star, such as Sirius, and hold the shutter open for more than a minute-to start.  Any exposure of length though, you will need a mount such as we use in astronomy for the telescopes to move with the earth so the stars don't blur.<br>  <br>  For widefield shots, I usually mount a camera with either my 105mm lens (has ED coatings) or a short 50mm lens with a minus violet filter (prevents chromatic abberations).  Then mount it to the top of my telescope and let the computer and motors drive it while I correct the movement thru the scope's eyepiece.  With a 50mm lens, set to F/4 or so, @ ISO400, my exposure time is usually between 12 and 15 minutes, depending on where I'm shooting from and what part of the sky I'm shooting.<br>  <br>  For planets, well, I don't know of any camera lens long enough to pull it off.  With astrophotography I have to use a method known as eyepiece projection.  The camera body is mounted so that the image from the telescopes eyepiece is projected onto the film plane or image sensor.  I haven't mastered the technique yet, my motor drive on my scope just isn't up for the task.  Any vibrations are going to show up on the image, hence the biggest reason many use webcams on their scopes and take very small resolution stills from the cam's software.  Many others that have a better budget, and equipment get great shots with thier DSLR and Film SLR, but it takes practice.<br>  <br>  To put it in perspective.  I use a 1016mm @ f/4 telescope, camera mounted directly to the scope, like a lens (prime focus).  With my digital, with it's 1.5x crop, it's the equivilant of 1524mm length.  Using that set up, the full moon fills 2/3 of my digital camera's viewfinder.  I turned the scope to Jupiter one time with it set up like that, it was a white dot, much larger than any of the stars, with 'pin pricks' you had to stare at to know they were there, those 'pin pricks' were Jupiter's moons.  Even with a teleconverter, the planets don't show up without a lot of magnification.<br>  <br>  For the record, the brightest planet visible right now is Venus.  She sits high in the western sky after sunset.  You can't miss her either, she's the third brightest object in the sky after the sun and moon.|`|TbTO5SXlaa	Unfortunately, your lens is far too short to take pictures of any celestial body other than the moon. To photograph the moon you can use the old "Sunny 16 Rule" which states: "On a sunny day set your f-stop to f16 and your shutter speed to 1/ISO."  The moon is a sunlit object. If you're using ISO 200 you might try an exposure of f16 at 1/200 sec. and then one at -1/2 EV and one at -1 EV.<br>  <br>  To photograph planets and/or constellations requires a telescope with an adapter for your camera and an equatorial mount. An equatorial mount counteracts the rotation of the Earth and keeps the telescope pointed at your heavenly subject.<br>  <br>  Here are a few sites that you will find of use:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astro.shoregalaxy.com/dslr_astro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astro.shoregalaxy.com/dslr_as...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.astropix.com/html/i_astrop/intro.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.astropix.com/html/i_astrop/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://neurohack.com/Astrophotography/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://neurohack.com/Astrophotography/in...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.danheller.com/star-trails.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.danheller.com/star-trails.htm...</a>|`|b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Yikes...you went out with a little camera with a telephoto lens and and you tried to get snapshots of the planets??<br>  <br>  What you're trying to do is called "astrophotography."  If you want to get clear pictures of the planets, then you're going to need a real telescope, and you'll have to use a mounting to couple the camera to the eyepiece.  Taking pictures of planets often involves a long exposure.  Remember, that since the Earth is rotating, EVERYTHING in the sky moves from east to west, including stars and planets.  So you're actually trying to take pictures of moving objects.  If you take a long exposure picture of the night sky, you'll get light trails caused by the stars and the rotation of the Earth.  In order to get clear pictures, you would have to use a telescope with a motorized tracking system that automatically moves to compensate for the Earth's rotation.<br>  <br>  Look up "astrophotography" for more information.  But it's a lot harder than you might think.|`|uPVnqbE8aa	Sorry, but a max of 300mm is nowhere near long enough.  If you're serious about pictures of the planets, you should either consider a good quality 2,000mm lens or a good 4X extender.<br>  The best way though, is to get a telescope adapter and mount your camera on a good telescope and snap away.|`|VkKS8nQuaa	It's borderline adequate for shooting wildlife on this planet and you want to shoot beyond this solar system with it?<br>  <br>  The simple answer?<br>  <br>  NO.

fefYXm71aa	damn.........get rid of that chic|`|9cBAUMnNaa	How does your GF feel about the dog? Dogs are very sensitive to peoples emotions, if she doesn't like him, or is afraid of him, or is mean to him behind your back, then the dog is being defensive. It may be the dog is possessive of you and resents her closeness to you. Sense of smell is probably the deal with the period situation. Hormones and pheromones may be the trigger, or the smell of blood may make the dog think something is wrong with her and she should be avoided. Maybe if its a female dog she smells a ***** in heat on her turf and is not gonna have it. (No offense to your GF!)<br>  Thats the best I can figure not knowing the girl or the dog but these are likely causes.|`|Kz8pCUDUaa	females jealousy;'|`|pBVGqgAQaa	maybe he has become jealous over you.|`|8ZdLnNTHaa	Is your girl friend human?<br>  Hope she is not a dog.<br>  Dogs fall in love with dogs.|`|FUyAN0aLaa	I don't know what you say|`|onkUcy19aa	Here is an opposite problem of your situation that could hopefully give you a better perspectives of things:<br>  <br>  My dog hates my boyfriend.<br>  <br>  1. Mebbe at first I thought it was cuz he was jealous but he has no reason to be. We have always been around lots of people and never had this problem before. My brother hates my boyfriend too but thats just cuz he hates all guys I hang around with cuz he thinks they do not have my best interest. <br>  My dog does not growl at my boyfriend but he kinda like grunts and groans and stares funny at him all the time and barks every time he comes in my apartment. We tried my boyfriend giving him treats and stuff like that and yeah my dog eats them but he can not be won over and he hangs his tail between his legs the whole time my boyfriend is around!! He does not like being petted by him either! <br>  I have been dating this guy for over 2 months now and he should be over it by now but my brother is telling me that he sees bad things in my boyfriend that I do not see and the dog knows things I do not know. <br>  This is my first real boyfriend ever and now my heart is torn cuz my dog does not want him around and I do not understand. My friends say that I should not allow my dog to rule my life but I do ask myself if what my brother says is true and my dog can see bad things in him. <br>  I like my boyfriend alot and he treats me nice and does not drive crazy and cuss people out on the road and act like an idiot like so many other guys do. Plus it just feels good to have a boyfriend and go out and have fun. <br>  Is there any way to get my dog to like him besides going for walks and giving treats and brushing and playing and stuff like that cuz he will not let him brush and play.<br>  <br>  2. Sorry to break this to you, but your dog is right. Animals *know*. They really do. We humans are raised to suppress and ignore all of the subtle signals that say *danger*. Ask anyone that's been in a bad relationship or marriage, and if they are honest, they will admit that there were red flags that they ignored. <br>  While on the surface it may sound ridiculous to end a relationship because your pet does not like them, is it really? <br>  <br>  I would do two things. First, keep paying attention to the boyfriend, watch how he treats other people, listen to how he gripes about things, and pay attention to how you feel when you are around him. If he treats others well (especially strangers), he is not negative, and does not act like he thinks he is superior to other people - great! If you can relax around him and not feel like you have to be on your best behavior, that is good, too. If you have to be careful not to make him mad - that is bad, bad, bad. If he makes you laugh and feel cared for, great! <br>  Next, keep an eye on your dog. He is used to having you all to himself. The time you give to your boyfriend, you are taking time away from him, so he is confused. You probably will want to give him a good walk or romp just before your boyfriend comes over, or with your boyfriend. A tired dog is a good dog. <br>  <br>  Just in case your brother is right about your dog understanding that the boyfriend is not good for you, see if you can figure out what makes your dog grumpy about him. Is it just after the boyfriend talks in a mean or irritated tone of voice? Does the boyfriend just have a louder voice than the dog is used to? Is it connected to the boyfriend touching you and the dog is just jealous? <br>  <br>  3. I would give it all some time, take it slowly, and trust your instincts. If the situation makes you uneasy, then something is wrong. You dog could just be sensing this, associates your uneasy vibes with the boyfriends, so just does not like him!|`|WchGezIAaa	Is it a male of female dog?<br>  If its a male, its because she is invading its territory. odds are it thinks its better than you.<br>  or<br>  It knows she is taking your attention and it dosnt like that.<br>  <br>  one of the two.<br>  <br>  you just need to introduce them properly.<br>  Go out to the park and do things with the three of you<br>  and be firm with it when it tries to be negative towards her.

AA10729271	Just because one is highly intelligent doesn't mean one likes being bored, or on occasion enjoys a piece of mindless escapism.<br>  <br>   I read the twilight novels (in about three days) and rather enjoyed them, of course i tend to love the whole tragic-love-fantasy-star-crossed-lover's thing, i recognize that the literary aspect of it isn't high, but what I think many people are missing is that from the aspect of a 'storytelling' tradition it is quite good, storytelling refers to the old-wives tales that people used to pass along verbally, most fairy tales started out that way before the Brother's Grimm and others set them down on paper, and that's what this series reminds me off, a modern fairy tale, very Beauty and the Beast. <br>  <br>  That's why it probably appeals to these younger girls, it's like a slightly cooler version of cinderella. Can you blame them, we raise them on idealized Disney versions of romantic love (the whole a girl needs a man to survive thing) and then we knock them for liking the very thing our society has promoted, are they supposed to become radical feminists the moment they hit 14? you could probably take any well known fairy tale and make all the same criticisms about it. The unreality, the chauvanisim, the reused plot devices. and yet kids still eat them up, generation after generation. big surprise teenagers like twilight, but i'm a twentysomthing college student with a 4.0 GPA and I still love fairy tales, and twilight, not all adults wan't to 'grow up' and lose our love of magic, even when we know it's all imaginary.<br>  <br>  Basically the haters are just bored, like me of course, else I wouldn't be here right now.

If all that was wrong with Twilight was that it is absolutely dreadfully written, the characters are one-dimensional, annoying Mary Sues and there is no plot to speak of, I wouldn't give a damn about it. But on top of that, it teaches its readers that physical attractiveness is equal to moral goodness, girls are nothing without their boyfriends and emotional abuse is romantic. Anything that makes people think that those things are true - and by god, it certainly does - needs to have people being critical about it as well. It's unhealthy at best and downright dangerous at worst.|`|usvPMtMtaa	yes, it is. the point must get across that twilight sucks<br>  and there is a whole club of us and we hate twilight so much and we wish to advertise the fact that it is a very sh*t piece of literature|`|TU7vDI95aa	There are a lot of Twilight haters because so many Twilight fans, like you, are incredibly annoying and won't shut up about these poorly written books.|`|W8F9PboZaa	Ok right so at the moment there are more haters then lovers. You came here a month ago and you would be inundated with questions of "EDWARD OR JACOB?!!" and "Do u reali think i culd marry edward cullen?" Do you have any idea how irritating that is. The only reason us haters exist is to combat the crazies. For every hater there is 3 crazies, the crazies are however less articulate and generally give one sentence answers and are therefore brushed off.<br>  <br>  If you look at the series from a literary standpoint you realise just how poorly written it is. I cannot believe that such an appallingly written book is so popular. I initially liked the series and it was from looking at the critical analysis of others HERE that i realized just how bad it was. I'm hoping to enlighten others :)<br>  <br>  Also I think they're a terrible example for younger kids, particularly girls. Bella is supposed to be a role model. She's shallow, one dimensional and her life revolves entirely around her boyfriend. When he leaves she falls apart and only pulls herself together when she finds another guy to take his place. She has no goals and her aim in life is to be with Edward forever. Not exactly the best role model huh?<br>  <br>  And Edward. This guy is supposed to be the 'perfect guy'. I grew up learning to love a person for who they are, not what they look like. Edward and Bella's relationship is based solely on looks. All they do is describe how beautiful the other is. This is how girls are growing up to see how relationships are supposed to be. No. I think that's terrible.<br>  <br>  And I never ask questions bashing Twilight. I answer them. And I answer pro-Twilight questions too. Simply because i like discussing my hate with other haters, and I like expressing my opinion. That's it. But I'm definitely not against the anti-Twilighters asking the questions. Most of them are really witty. And because we actually are literate and can use the searchbar most of them are original and hilarious. The others I just post my generic anti-twilight post to lol<br>  <br>  The reason there wasn't much of this with Harry Potter is simply because Harry Potter is actually well written. The fanbase is huge spanning over many ages and both sexes. Although there are adults who love Twilight, the majority of the fans, and 99.9% of the insane Twitards, are below 17 and female. And most of them have read under 10 books in their life|`|eLeEwn20aa	I don't think that it's fair to share your feelings of hate... No wonder the world is like it is!!! You should focus your hate on OTHER more IMPORTANT things... You seem to hate the Twilight Saga with a passion when you could EASILY hate something much more worth while! Let people enjoy a book. They don't care whether it's written well or if the relationships seem to be based on looks (which they aren't by the way... Bella just can't believe that she ended up with someone that beautiful who happens to think of her in the same way!). People care about the plot but most importantly about how it makes them feel. What all you Twilight Haters are doing is stopping people from being happy...<br>  If you don't like Twilight then don't talk to people who do and don't waste your time answering the questions about Pro-Twilight when you hate it! How would you like it if your favourite book, or one that you really enjoyed, was being criticized non-stop! Your taking happiness away from innocent people and I don't think that's fair! You wouldn't like that to happen to you so why are you doing it to someone else?<br>  (If you have a problem with this, please go ahead, e-mail me!!!)|`|9794VMZ9aa	I'm a 12 year old... I have read Twilight (up to book 3) and yes, they aren't based on true love, just looks. And I can understand why that would miff some people off (including myself, actually).<br>  <br>  They were okay. Yes, she's a terrible writer, but because you are waiting for a twist to happen, you just have to keep reading. They were OKAY, but I'm not obsessed with them. I'm kinda neutral.<br>  <br>  I'm not pathetic. I know how to spell, I read a wide range of books, I'm particularly interested in war books (I'm not like the 12 year old obsessed readers, I do read about history and real life situations), I do not fantasize about marrying fictional characters, I pay lots of attention to my school studies... surely this isn't the making of a 'pathetic 12 year old'?<br>  <br>  So, in short, I absolutely agree with you. Yes, the lovers annoy me as-well, but just as much as the haters.<br>  <br>  --Hayley.|`|uD7giDNjaa	I think that people think that they look cool if they go against the majority.<br>  <br>  It did happen with Harry Potter, in the beginning. There was a massive group of people that tried to ban Harry Potter from Schools and Libraries. I read about it in Harry, A History, it's a real book.<br>  <br>  I like the book, and I am not a pathetic 12 Year old. I hate that stereotype.|`|I7YFlxPMaa	I personally hate the book. But I know some of the most intelligent people that do. Some of my closest friends like Twilight, and I still enjoy the company. What some fans (and NOT all fans) do is take it personal that people dislike their favorite book. What they don't get is that we hate the book, not the people that don't.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Yes i agree, these haters have gone too far.<br>  They are immature and are as bad as the rabid Twi-Hards.<br>  <br>  They need to grow up, and half of them haven't even read the books.<br>  <br>  Hey, I have read the books, enjoyed them, thought they were okay and I maintain a mature approach when voicing my opinion about them.|`|1Txef261aa	Everyone is different I love those books I don't care that people hate they made me happy|`|AjqO1aJgaa	Because it's such a dreadfully written book.<br>  <br>  "if you do like the book-your automatically stereotyped to some pathetic 12 year old"<br>  <br>  Yup. That's what a "target audience" is. If you like Twilight, chances are you are a 12 year old girl. Any older than 12 and you should know that healthy loving relationships don't work like that.<br>  <br>  "if you dont like the book-you think your above everyone els who does"<br>  <br>  If you're older than 12 and not capable of spotting the massive plotholes and cardboard characterisation, I'm afraid it's hard to see you as being even remotely intelligent. This is heightened by the fact that most people defending the book - including you - don't know the difference between "you're" and "your" or that "I" has a capital letter. You know, the sort of basic grammar you learn when you are eight. Darn right I think I'm "above" a teen or adult whose technical English is worse than my 9 year old son's.<br>  <br>  "i dont remember this happening with harry potter"<br>  <br>  No, it didn't. That's because the Harry Potter books are not full of plotholes and have good characterisation.<br>  <br>  I have no problem at all with people loving the books despite their issues. My problem is with people claiming they are well written and "mature". Especially people who are borderline illiterate.

se ha creado la necesidad de explicarse todo lo que ocurre en su entorno y por ende todo lo que no pudo explicar considero que era de obra divina y surgieron alrrededor del mundo varias corrientes mitologicas y cada una explicaba a su modo las cosas y partiendo de esas ideas  el hobre ha creado a dios pero desde otro punto de vista   dios creo al hombre y todo el sustento de la creacion esta en el libro filosofico, terapeutico y por que no decirlo el mejor de todos y por cierto el mas vendido y leido en el mundo la biblia. creo que tu pregunta es un buen planteamiento filosofico pero

la Mujer) somos bastante, demasiados imperfectos y entoces ?Dios es imperfecto?<br>  <br>  En la antigüedad los humanos en distintas culturas adoraban a variedad de Dioses y Diosas y lo interesante es que cada uno de ellos era representante de la Naturaleza y de la Vida.<br>  Los hebreos "descubrieron" a ese Dios que menciona la Biblia y de allí queda la religión hebrea, aparece unos 2400 a?os mas tarde el cristianismo que en los Concilios de Nicea divinizan a Cristo como el Hijo de Dios nacido de madre virgen y toda esa fábula patética que da lugar a la Iglesia Católica, pero despues otra facción toma a Mahoma como El Profeta suprema y nace el Islamismo que en principio fue un promotor de la sabiduría, de las ciencias, de las artes mejor que el catolicismo y que desgraciadamente hoy es otra cosa completamente distinta.<br>  Y despues el cisma del protestantismo que dio lugar a uno de los mejores negocios que existen en estas épocas que son las iglesias evangélicas.<br>  <br>  A mi

gwM3ZXuEaa	For this answer I am going to substitute the word "right" for "correct.."<br>  <br>  People hold a very flimsy grip on reality, therefore their opinions contradict more frequently than not. So, if everyone was correct, even those with contradicting beliefs, reality (and I use that word to refer to reality as it is interpreted by the human senses, or "Conscious reality") would have contradicting truths. What that would do to reality is more a question for metaphysicists than an epistemological philosopher like myself.<br>  <br>  There could be what we now, in this frame, call Human Good without what we now call Human Bad. However without contrast there is no perception. So, while if someone would look into that hypothetical world from this one, they would only see good, the perception would be there because of his past experiences with evil. However the people on that world would not know evil, and would therefore have no concept of what good even is.|`|wxSO48E3aa	A to Q 1.  Yes I think it could be possible for a mass extinction of humans in a single day.  The only cause I can think of would be when the sun explodes at the end of it's life and incinerates all the planets in the solar system.  All life on earth would cease on that day.<br>  <br>  A to Q 2.  I don't think there could be human good without also having human bad.  If there was no human bad then there would only be human good and only having good is impossible to achieve in human terms.  Being both good and bad is what makes us human.|`|ukASnhn5aa	That is most probably magic.Least likely- at least now.<br>  <br>  It depends on personal opinion, there are no such thing as good or bad if you want to see it that way.

His intensive study of Dragon Magic, based on Oriental astrology, involves two kinds of skills: sword-work and magical aptitude. He and his master hope that he will be chosen as a Dragoneye - an apprentice to one of the 12 energy dragons of good fortune. <br>  But Eon has a dangerous secret. He is actually Eona, a 16-year-old girl who has been masquerading as a 12-year-old boy for the chance to become a Dragoneye. <br>  <br>  Females are forbidden to use Dragon Magic; if anyone discovers she has been hiding in plain sight, her death is assured. When Eon's secret threatens to come to light, she and her allies are plunged into grave danger and a deadly struggle for the Imperial throne.

1Y21zyokaa	Dualism covers a whole range of things but means that there are two substances (usually minds and bodies). Interactionism says that those two things can interact with each other.<br>  <br>  Interactionism is a more specific version of dualism. I could be a dualist and think that minds and bodies don't interact but I can't think that and be an interactionist. <br>  <br>  The reason this is interesting is because we haven't got a good explanation for how a non-physical thing can act on a physical thing. It requires the use of energy to move any physical thing and minds don't have physical energy to expend. If they did interact, they would essentially be adding energy to the universe which the laws of physics says is impossible.
b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	Yeah, unfortunately they can't print your pictures from the entire width of your film, only the standard frame size.  They develop the film, and then basically just scan the negatives and make the prints from the scan.  120 film is much larger than 35mm, so when you expose 35mm film in your Holga camera, it will expose the ENTIRE film, including the sprockets.  But the problem is that most photo labs (especially 1-hour labs) are only set up to make prints from the standard frame size. <br>  <br>  I don't think the problem was with the Walgreens photo lab this time.  But I HAVE had problems with Walgreens.  Unfortunately, it's kind of a 50\50 chance that they'll develop your film right.  There's a Walgreens just down the street from me, and I was taking my color film there to get developed for a while.  They actually did a pretty good job with it.  But lately, every time I go down there the photo lab is closed, and there's a sign saying the lab is only available for pick-up.  So I guess they have a shortage of workers.  I decided to take my film to another Walgreens across town, and they totally ruined it.  There were spots all over my pictures, and when I looked at the negatives I could see that there was some kind of chemical stains and residue all over the film.  So something happened while they were developing the film.  I went back and talked to the Assistant Manager and showed him the pictures and the negatives.  He apologized and said that they probably didn't clean the machine when they were supposed to.  He gave me a refund.  Well, there were a few other people getting film developed there, and you know their pictures are going to be ruined too.<br>  <br>  The sad thing is those people will probably blame it on the film.  Their pictures will be ruined and they'll think "oh, I guess it's because it's film."  They'll think that ALL film captures bad pictures with spots and streaks, and they'll just wind up getting discouraged by film.   They'll get a cheap point and shoot digital camera, thinking it has to be better than film.  They probably wouldn't realize that's it's because the lab screwed up, and that if film is PROPERLY developed by a good photo lab, it will capture awesome pictures that are perfectly clear and razor sharp.<br>  <br>  If you want the entire width of your film printed (including the sprockets), then you'll probably have to send it to a professional lab and ask for custom printing.<br>  <br>  Try one of these places.  Call or email them before you send your film, to explain what you want and see if they can do it for you:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bluemooncamera.com/index.php?fuseaction=services.main&bmcstore=4cbe9c656571cf8d936fdf03d8c1b530" rel="nofollow">http://www.bluemooncamera.com/index.php?...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.northcoastphoto.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.northcoastphoto.com/index.htm...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.dalelabs.com/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.dalelabs.com/index.html</a>      <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.iconla.com/photographic_lab.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.iconla.com/photographic_lab.p...</a><br>  <br>  If you really get into film photography, you should also think about using black and white film and learn to develop it yourself.  It really isn't that hard to do, and you can order all the chemicals and supplies you need online.  Then you can develop your own film and print your own pictures EXACTLY the way you want!  For example, if you wanted, you could take panaoramic pictures with 35mm film in your Holga camera, and then make what are called "contact prints."  Basically, you develop a picture straight from the entire negative, including the sprockets.  Also, if you make real optical prints with an enlarger and develop it in your own darkroom, your picture will look MUCH better than what you get from a 1-hour photo lab!  If you're interested in learning how to develop B&W film, email me and I can help you get started.<br>  <br>  By the way, I'm sorry about what I posted in your last question.  Sometimes I forget that a lot of times random people just come in and vote thumbs down because they think it's funny.  I still personally don't think Holga cameras are too great, but I'm sure you can have a lot of fun with it. <br>  <br>  Good luck :)|`|cBNjgxW9aa	If there were six exposures on the roll that was processed, that very likely means that their processor worked just fine and the problem lies elsewhere, other than with Walgreens.  Also, when they print 35mm film, the frame plate is only big enough for the picture area on the film, it is not going to show the sprockets.  That's a custom lab job, and Walgreens is by no means a custom lab.|`|AmVvWChdaa	I've had many problems with them. They actually lost a whole roll of film once. I don't understand how they could lose the whole thing of pictures within an hour, but they found a way. Sad thing is...I'll never get those pictures back.
b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	One thing you need to keep in mind with those plastic "lomography" cameras, like the Holga and Diana, is that you have very little manual exposure control.  You can't change the shutter speed, and I think it only has two F-stops...and they're not very accurate either.  So you have to try to use a film that will work with the lighting conditions that you expect to have.  You'll notice that all films have what's called the "ISO rating."  That's the number labeled on the film roll.  (Sometimes, it's also called the "film speed.")  A higher ISO rating means the film is more sensitive to light, and a lower ISO rating means that the film is less sensitive.  So for example, 400 ISO film is more light sensitive than 200 ISO film.<br>  <br>  If you use a film that has an ISO rating that's too high, you might overexpose it in your Holga camera (since you can't change the shutter speed).  Higher ISO films also tend to have more grain.  It's kind of a trade-off.  A higher ISO film will let you take pictures in lower light, but your pictures will be more grainy.  So I would NOT recommend using anything higher than 400 ISO.  In fact, if you're going to be taking most of your pictures outdoors, I would recommend using a 200 ISO film, like maybe Fuji 200 or Kodak Gold 200.  They're both great, and they're standard color film that you can get developed anywhere.<br>  <br>  I love using film (90 percent of the pictures I take now are with film).  But I personally just don't care that much for lomography cameras.  I'm sure they're a lot of fun, but I prefer using cameras that have completely manual exposure control (where you can set the aperture and shutter speed yourself manually).  So I mostly use rangefinder and SLR cameras.  Also, I love taking landscape photos, so I want the sharpest, clearest picture I can get.  I use both 35mm film and 120 size film (medium format).  I'm sure lomography cameras are fun and creative, but they're very poor quality.  They're made almost entirely out of plastic, including the lens.  And they have a lot of defects like soft focus and color fringing, and light leaks.  Some people like those defects to get interesting effects in their pictures, but it's entirely because of defects in the camera and it has nothing to do with the film.  A better quality film camera, like a 35mm SLR or rangefinder camera will give very sharp, clear pictures.  And if you ever saw pictures taken with 120 film (with a good quality camera), you would be amazed.<br>  <br>  EDIT:<br>  <br>  You can vote thumbs down all you want.  I really don't care.  Just don't get a film that has an ISO rating of any more than 400 or you will overexpose it in your little plastic lomography camera.  You can't change the shutter speed on the Holga, it's fixed at one shutter speed of around 1/100.  (Even the shutter speed isn't very consistant on those cameras and it seems to vary from one to the next).  You asked for specific films, and I named a few that you could use...Fuji 200, Kodak Gold 200, or maybe Fuji 400.  But what I said about lomography cameras is well known and completely true.  Go ahead and vote thumbs down if you like.|`|65109cb8f29d34e3d6fc411bd1edae58aa	Ilford XP2<br>  <br>  Lot's of exposure latitude, great tonality, can be processed anywhere and it's fast enough for the Holga.

a0a4b271882587e60ffff0e04ab06fb3aa	Any literary work is protected the moment you put a copyright notice on the material--whether you've actually filed your copyright with the LOC or not. That, however, does not protect you from other people using your concept or the ideas in it. Copyright simply gives you the right to recoup monetary damages when your material has been sold by others and you can prove it in court. Otherwise, it's like a screen door in a submarine.<br>  <br>  I have found the best protection for new material is having people read it online--like a readers' group where you can document that others have seen your work. The web is the best place to do that. If your material has been seen by thousands of people, then it's clearly established who wrote it and when. That tends to make pirates and plagiarizers shy away from your material, though some may still try to rip you off. It's when they try to SELL your words and claim them as their own that you have to fall back on the Copyright laws, which means legal action--very costly and time consuming.<br>  <br>  You can forget about that old myth of mailing the material to yourself. It has been tested in court and failed MISERABLY. Doing that offers ZERO protection from copyright infringement. If you really want to be safe, spend the $30 to copyright the material, then wait six or eight weeks to get the LOC confirmation back before you send out copies of your script. You can also find a valid confidentiality agreement at LegalZoom.com for a few bucks. Sadly, those are very expensive to enforce and hardly worth the effort. Good luck!<br>  <br>  Jon F.

This can be done very inexpensively by mailing your script to yourself. When you receive your script in the mail, do not open it. File it. Therefore, in the case you feel to seek legal action, bring your unopened script to court. With the envelope being sealed and with the postal service having a date stamped on the outside with your name and address on it, you have basic, legal, proof that the script is yours.

If you are face to face same thing move to her rhythm, or the rhythm of the music. If your in middle school, i advise to not to stand too close, teachers don't like it. High school, do what you want. Usually hands on her waist, don't wander, its disrespectful.<br>  <br>  main thing: BOUNCE to the rhythm, but not hopping...<br>  also, you could get some of your friends to teach you... I've taught my guy friends...so, just ask people!

1jMwr6E0aa	Bella's blood is NOT irresistable to all vampires. It says in the book that she certainly smells appealing but that its nowhere near as difficult for the others as it is for Edward. She wouldn't be special to Edward if everyone struggled the same way. James reacted the way he did only because of how Edward reacted to him calling her a snack. Have you ever heard how we always want what we can't have? I think that was the case here. James being an excellent tracker not only saw a challenge, but the opportunity to get something that was completely denied to him.|`|YEfW3vI0aa	Because once he got the idea in his head he just had to do it.<br>  Also I think Bella smell 'irresistible' to all vampires, not just Edward.<br>  <br>  James is a tracker, that is his power so that is what he enjoys doing so Bella was just another human to track.|`|b1cVZbX7aa	Coz he likes to take challenges. He take it as a challenge to kill Bella when a family of 7 powerful vampires are there to protect her.|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Because James is a tracker and would kill any human not just Bella personally.|`|eLeEwn20aa	It's because when he says "Ahhh, you've brought a snack", Edward's reaction was very protective and that made James want to hunt her down... The hunt is his obsession because, well, that's his power. Like how Jasper can control the feelings in a room and Alice can predict the future, how Edward reads minds. James is a Tracker. He's not the most powerful but he is on and that's why he's obsessed with the hunt.|`|8X0nWxBYaa	This question is answered in the book.<br>  <br>  Just because Bella is Edward's brand of heroin doesn't  mean she isn't attractive like that to everyone else. James also admired the smell very much. If Bella smelt to James as she smells to Edward that would have meant a full out fight right there.<br>  <br>  Also, when Edward went to protect Bella, that set James off. It "pulled the trigger" and made it his most exciting game ever.|`|3reHk4I1aa	james likes a challenge and he saw bella s the challenge. her blood does smell good to everyone else too. but james decided to hunt bella down because edward was overprotective of bella and like i said james loves a challenge it was proven in the book didnt you read the book?|`|OHTeRwSuaa	First, he's a tracker, so he's hunting as a sport, and is playing a game. <br>  Second, Edward standing up for Bella made the game a lot more challenging. Who doesn't love a challenge?<br>  Third, revenge for the fact that Alice is the only human who ever escaped him. Killing Bella would make it even.|`|HsuoFa6qaa	James is a tracker. He tracks down humans.<br>  <br>  As said, Bella smells irresistible to James as he is a tracker and he feels he must kill her or in other words must have her blood.|`|DOkWTB8baa	James seeks to hunt Bella because of Edward defending her. <br>  He doesn't quite understand why Edward would do that.<br>  And I partly think he is jealous of the relationship between Edward and Bella.|`|GW1PzzdSaa	To spite Edward. He has seen how protective of Bella Edward is and to spite Edward, he wants to kill Bella.|`|RIdVkecAaa	he wants to fight edward for fun|`|DDUHqELuaa	<a href="http://yanswering.swims.it" rel="nofollow">http://yanswering.swims.it</a><br>  A very informative website, kindly stay a minute in website and enter you email address for getting your answer.|`|AA11703549	I don't think bella smells "irresistible" to all vampires. But from the way it was stated in the book, I think James was more enthralled by Edward's immediate reaction to protect Bella than by Bella herself. He was really looking for the challenge of fighting Edward and Bella was his way of getting to him.|`|GbQ6zGuZaa	1) James does that because Bella;s blood is irrestiable to all the vampires <br>  2) Hunt is his obsession probably because that he likes to drink human blood<br>  3) Its probably because of Alice because back then He did not destroy Alice and now he wants to destroy Bella so then he can get what he wants
WYngdeacaa	Well, as in many cases, the Supreme Court botched it.  It was the Dred Scott decision of 1857.  At the time, the Supreme Court was dominated by Southerners.<br>  <br>  Up until that case, the two sides had managed to develop compromise after compromise to keep the peace.  Some states had slaver, some didn't.  <br>  <br>  In general, the free states developed an "out of site, out of mind" approach.  There was no TV, Radio, Telephones, cars, air travel and even the telegraph was limited.  Newspapers and magazines were very local, and the vast majority didn't give the issue much coverage.  There were books such as "Uncle Tom's Cabin", but while they outraged many, they didn't cause a widespread movement.  <br>  <br>  There were, of course, politicians, organizations, magazines, and newspapers were dedicated solely to ending slavery or at least was part of their social reform goals.  These were actually very small factions.  The vast majority of those in free states may have not liked slavery, but they tolerated it as long as it was not in "their back yard".<br>  <br>  The slave states resented the work of anti-slavery forces in the free states, but various compromises kept them placated.  In fact, the first secession crisis occurred, not over slavery, but taxes.  South Carolina threatened to seceded over an tariff (import tax).  <br>  <br>  Southern culture saw industrialization as a vulgar, lower class thing.  As a result, they had to import a lot of stuff.  At the time, Britain was the leading manufacturer of its time.  It could produce and sell goods in America far cheaper than American firms.  The tariff was designed to level the playing field for American firms.  This hit the South hard since most sine they imported the most and because they were farthest away from American factories in the North.  Railroads and steam ships were in their infancy.  Transport was very expensive so importing from the North vs. importing from the South only reduced the cost a little.  Prices still went up.<br>  <br>  President Andrew Jackson threatened to personally march and army into South Carolina and hang anyone involved.  This was no empty threat.  Jackson was nuts.  South Carolina backed down, but I digress.  <br>  <br>  In 1857, the Supreme Court ruled that there is no such thing as a free state and slave state.  The ruling basically said that neither the federal government or the state governments could ban people from owning or selling slaves anywhere in the United States.  <br>  <br>  Although, the word slavery (or slave) was never directly put into the constitution, there is some really complicated lawyer language which accomplishes the same thing.  Dred Scot was actually based on that indirect protection.<br>  <br>  Every compromise was suddenly null and void.  Every state law banning slavery was void.  The Court and President Buchanan actually thought this settled matter once and for all.  They were idiots.<br>  <br>  The slave states were naturally elated.  The free states went nuts.  Suddenly, New York, California, Michigan, Ohio, etc. were slave states.  Previously, they were able to live with slavery on the idea that their states didn't participate.  They may have not liked it, but they weren't really involved.  It's like watching someone get mugged.  You may not like it and may feel ashamed that you don't help, but you're not an accomplice.  This ruling destroyed that thin moral protection.  <br>  <br>  All Americans were aiding and abetting slavery.  It also didn't help matters that, after the ruling, Southerners would taunt Northers by saying how they would move to Boston and set up a slave auction site in Harvard Yard.<br>  <br>  This set the two sides on a collision course.  Mainstream politicians, newspapers, and magazines in the now former free states started to give the issue play.  The Supreme Court had gone too far.  Well, there is one way to overrule the Supreme Court, constitutional amendment.<br>  <br>  In 1860, there were 33 states.  11 would form the Confederacy.  4 would be pro-union slave states (Maryland, Missouri, Kentucky, and Delaware).  Don't ask me why Delaware was a slave state.  It actually had the best race relations in the country.  I think they never had much use for slavery so they never got around to banning.  It would be like Kansas banning whale hunting, great sentiment but very little need in Kansas.<br>  <br>  That left 18 (19 with Delaware) states solidly against slavery.  It takes 2/3 majority in both houses to submit a constitutional amendment to the states.  It takes 2/3 of the states to approve.  The numbers weren't there yet, but the trend was going against the slave forces.<br>  <br>  The House was probably a lock for the anti-slavery forces.  The North's population dwarfed the South.  Also, nearly all new immigrants entered the US through Northern states.  Being new to America, they were not all that fond of slavery.  1860, was a census year.  In all likelihood, the census would give the North huge gains in seats in the House of Representatives.<br>  <br>  The Senate and the States were also about to go.  Every potential state on the horizon was not a place that required slave labor:  Nebraska, Colorado, Nevada, etc.  The only place cotton would grow in any state admitted after 1860 was Arizona and it didn't become a state until 1912.<br>  <br>  Initially, the majority of forces working on a constitutional amendment wanted only to reverse Dred Scott and return to the previous state of things.   As time went on and passions rose, people started thinking in broader terms.  Some agitated to banning it totally by constitutional amendment.  Eventually a compromise position started to emerge.  <br>  <br>  The majority were not ready to ban slavery totally, but they wanted to strip the constitution of all protection of slavery.  This was not a ban.  It would not end slavery, but slavery would no longer be protected from the Federal government.  Eventually, congress could just pass a law ending it.  As mentioned the way, the make up of congress would eventually make this a real possibility.<br>  <br>  This time the South went nuts.  By trying to settle the issue absolutely in their own favor, Southerners only galvanized the resistance on the other side.  The South broke years of uneasy peace in one shot to settle things.  They missed.  Now, the other side was pissed and wanted to return the favor.<br>  <br>  This was no were clearer than the presidential election of 1860.  Lincoln won the Presidency without a single Southern state.  In most of the South, the states refused to put his name on the ballot.  It's like Admiral Yamamoto said after ordering the attack on Pearl Harbor, "We have only awakened a sleeping giant."|`|4147a50109498d46606a694f7b23b512aa	In the US? The south actually needed manual labor for working their cotton fields, so they relied too much on slaves.|`|zu5f76Ciaa	The difficulty early Americans had with slavery was not that they did not see it wrong; many of the nations leaders were against slavery. It had to do with slaves potentially rioting against their former masters once they were free in retaliation for the harsh way they were treated. A good way to think of this dilemma: imagine you are holding onto the leash of an aggressive dog (slavery). You want get away from the dog, but if you let go, it might bite you. <br>  <br>      The Southern economy was also heavily dependent on slave labor. Slaves were heavy investments and planters would not give up their hard-earned "assets" easily. Hope that helps!

VY7dlcx7aa	Actually, the song was originally one of the songs that was created for the first Lion King movie that never made it into the final film.  It was first available to the public on the cassette called "Rhythm of the Pridelands", which came out shortly after the first film.  The song was THEN used for the Broadway show and the sequel.  <br>  In fact, quite a few songs from the Broadway show were taken from the "Rhythm of the Pridelands" tape- the broadway song "Shadowland" is actually "Lea Halalela (Holy Land)" on the Rhythm of the Pridelands tape (the original song was all in Swahili and is very pretty- the english version is okay but they changed the meaning/translation to fit the show).<br>  <br>  So, to answer your question, neither!- cuz' Rhythm of the Pridelands was released in February 1995 , well before the Broadway show (July 1997) and the Lion King II (October 1998).

FZ0hwowaaa	Guidelines for your question;<br>  <br>  ? Keep your query letter brief and to the point, which generally means no longer than a page.<br>  ? At the top of your query letter put the title, genre and length of your book.<br>   ? Begin your query letter with your subject hook, a brief but compelling description of the subject you are covering. <br>   ? You can follow this with a paragraph or two that gives an outline of the book and its special features.<br>  . The next paragraph should cover the market potential of your book.<br>   ? Explain why you are qualified to write the book. Only include relevant background information about yourself that pertains to the subject matter that you are covering.<br>  ? Format your query letter so that it’s easy to read. Short paragraphs and short sentences.<br>  ? Don’t forget to include your contact details in full.|`|TU7vDI95aa	Are you a first-time author?  If so, you should write a "query" rather than a "proposal."  The first step is to finish your book.  Then write a one-page letter to each agent you've selected telling him or her that you're seeking representation, why you've chosen him or her, and what your story is about.  Each agent has certain submission requirements, so check out www.agentquery.com to check on them.  Keeping the synopsis short is a challenge, but a good writer can make it happen.  No agent is going to want to read a five-page query letter.  Good luck!<br>  <br>  Edit: The guy above me gives a lot of good tips.  Make sure to follow them!|`|GwFKW4Wsaa	I do believe thats the "synopsis" and its meant to be about 1-2 pages in narrative form entailing the entire story/novel....<br>  <br>  So maybe extend the 12 lines and loose the other paragraphs...you can also Google it
zu5f76Ciaa	Oh yes, definitely. Nationalism was a root cause for the fascist governments that sprang up in the Axis nations (Germany, Japan, Italy). Hitler riled up German national pride by criticizing the terms of the Versailles Treaty, which laid sole blame for World War I on Germany. Mussolini got support for a fascist government in Italy by stirring up feelings for an empire that mimicked ancient Rome, Italy's predecessor. The Japanese also had a strong history of nationalism to the emperor. Hope that helps!|`|WfHRRCZfaa	Yes<br>  <br>  The rise of the fascist movement throughout Europe scared many nations with anti-facist ideologies. Also, Nazi Germany resorted to genocide in order to spread it social and political ideology|`|2c76d7eb5804cf4a63f2667d2bebcfbaaa	no not really. it was hitler disliking jews, and germany loving hitler. ww1 was all about nationalism though|`|6k90tHsAaa	yes, nationalism just means that you think your nation is the best and thinking everyone else sucks.  so even the guy who says no means yes.

gLp7pvPnaa	Those of us who are interested, are aware of the blind cruelty of natural selection. It is uncompromising cruelty, no compassion, just indifference.<br>  <br>  We do have the potential to control our short term future, but in the long run we don't. Nature will put forth and take back, no compassion, just indifference.<br>  <br>  We are so privileged, nature has endowed us with minds that can comprehend such things, minds with compassion and abhorrence of cruelty. We are simply a part of nature and what it gives it will take back.|`|kuFAx4ymaa	You're really asking more questions than it seems...<br>  <br>  A capacity for evolutionary awareness is possible, but as it stands currently, we are evolving, we are polluting our potential.  Yes, this is a very non-humanitarian point of view, but it is truth.  By providing treatment for genetic diseases, and letting those afflicted breed, we are allowing the negative mutation to continue to future generations.  Whereas in nature these would be eliminated.  Rather than finding cures, we simply address symptoms, which is really just prolonging the problem...<br>  <br>  This point is not relevant to the second part of your question...  Nor is evolution itself...  We do have the ability to decide our own futures...  But this is on a generational level, that is, we are able to decide where we, as individuals, would like to go.  As far as where the species goes as a whole in the future, no, we are not in control and so long as we value freedom and individuality, we never will be.  The only way to really be in control of the future evolution of our species would be a nazi-like fascist system in which all weakness was systematically eliminated from the gene pool...  Which is decidedly a bad thing.<br>  <br>  The reality is that our future is doomed by our emotions.  We are not machines, we react in irrational unpredictable ways...  This will be our undoing...  When and where is something we can not predict, but we move ever closer...|`|XfSJZCEyaa	We can certainly decide our own future. We have become so far up ahead, that with science, we can spot diseases and contain them. We learn to evacuate if there is a biohazard in our area. <br>  <br>  And in the near future, we would be able to correct genetic flaws with science. <br>  <br>  Superbug spreading? Counter it with superior antibiotics (or nanobots). <br>  Asteroid heading for us? Drag it away with rockets before it reaches our gravity field.<br>  Sun going to explode? Migrate to another planet.<br>  <br>  <br>  We're so highly adaptable that nature must regret our existence.|`|7aVOCIh4aa	Well....deciding our own future: doesnt that sound a bit extreme...i mean we all know that earth will be destroyed after a million years and theres hardly anything we can do about it <br>  <br>  We are influencing nature through a great deal of thinking and for that reason i sometimes think that someday we might have the technology to thrive on other planets or stay on the earth until its destruction is ABSOLUTELY inevitable|`|eO1o511daa	Well I'm aware that I'm here, as are you.

But if I asked the PE teacher, which one of the members of the football team was the tallest, the answer, this is easy to be found, for this time, we were dealing with a relatively simplistic fact about human physiology. The level of complexity of the human mind, and the corresponding human physical abilities is huge: how for instance one could account for the limitlessness of human imagination? The flights of our fancy no know bounds; with entire human physical ability we are merely enable to live on ground. <br>  <br>  I therefore think that the process of our physical evolution is might be correctly detailed in his Theory of Evolution and Survival of the Fittest by Natural Selection by Charles Darwin, but he might have over-looked the evolution of mind might, which I believe has been originated, mapped out, scaled and inspired into action by some act of some greater agency in existence.|`|wxSO48E3aa	It's probably a bit of both.<br>  <br>  We've got the ability to manipulate genes and alter our own genetic make up but we've got no idea what effect the alterations might make down the line.<br>  <br>  In a way I think we're trying to take some control of our evolution, by trying to discover which genes cause diseases etc and trying to take them out of the equation.  But we've got no way of knowing what natural evolution will do to adjust to the changes we're making to the human genome. <br>  <br>  I suppose it's trial and error and by that process we will learn what works and what doesn't.|`|1LB7NBhcaa	we do have the power to dictate our own path take crime if your hungary do you steal bread or go to a charity place if you hate some one do you ignore or get rid of them its your choice its about the path you take if your rich and lucky will you become greedy and mean its all about the person and morals look if you get on a plane and the Pilot dies it was tecnalley his time to die but not yours you made the choice of getting on that plane so it was your decision to get on that plane|`|xPeIvywdaa	we didnt come to exist by natural means

UKGPj6Emaa	In the early years of the 20th Century (prior to Prohibition), the American Mafia's influence was restricted mainly to Italian immigrant communities in urban slums. They did not yet have the power or resources to pose a threat to society outside the Italian community. The immigrant community, composed of mostly southern Italians and Sicilians who were well aware of the murder and terrorism practiced in their homeland by societies such as the Mafia and Camorra, were terrorized by these emerging crime families and afraid to go the police. The Mafia routinely killed informers and got away with it, as everyone in the Italian communities knew.<br>  <br>  As with other immigrant groups, Italians were also the victims of prejudice and bigotry from earlier arrivals and lived near the bottom of the U.S. social/economic/political structure. Like other immigrants, they had also lived under totalitarian regimes in their homeland and saw no reason to trust any form of government. While victimizing their fellow Italians, the Mafia did at least provide some measure of order and protection in the neighborhood as well.<br>  <br>  Mafia organizations in the early 1900s were also so secretive that most law enforcement agencies of the time didn't even know of their existance. It was an automatic death penalty at the time for any Mafia member to admit his membership, or even talk about the organization's existence.|`|2f364660a9e7be4d45ae529341311f50aa	The Prohibition era of the 1920s gave rise to the organized crime syndicate in the United States. Federal efforts to enforce prohibition, including raids on speakeasies, were countered by well-organized bootlegging operations with national and international connections. A particularly notorious gang of the times was Al Capone's mob in Chicago. There were also gangs in Detroit, New York and other cities. Wars among gangs, producing grisly killings, frequently made headlines.<br>  <br>  <br>  Eventually, the public's repugnance, given voice by the 1930 Wickersham Commission inquiry, as well as numerous revelations of compromised municipal officials, produced a temporary suppression of political corruption. <br>  <br>  When the 1933 repeal of prohibition made buying liquor legal once again, gangs that were still intact resorted to different sources of illegal gain, among them gambling, narcotics trafficking and labor racketeering.<br>  <br>  Crime kingpins of the 1930s knew from experience in the previous decade that solid political connections were an advantage, and inter-gang fighting held severe drawbacks. The Syndicate, a close-knit national organization comprising numerous crime leaders from around the country, was forged by Lucky Luciano and Louis Kepke Buchalter. Its underground polity set geographical boundaries, distributed crime profits, and enforced its edicts with the help of Murder, Inc., its hoodlum cohort.<br>  <br>  Luciano was arrested, tried, convicted, and later deported to Italy. Buchalter was executed and Murder, Inc. was broken up. With those head blows against organized crime, it was thought by some to be terminated in the United States.<br>  <br>  <br>  U.S. Senator Estes Kefauver and his investigative committee disclosed in 1950 and 1951 that the organized crime hydra was still alive — with new heads. A new wrinkle revealed by the committee indicated that the latest crime lords had sealed themselves off from prosecution by hiding behind legitimate business enterprises and avoiding direct involvement with criminal behavior. Attempts to deport top racketeers were among the tactics used by law enforcement following the Kefauver committee revelations.<br>  <br>  Police in Apalachin, New York, happened upon a major convocation of crime lords in November 1957. They were from all over the U.S. and overseas. The discovery prompted investigations that laid bare the tenacious power and reach of organized crime in the middle of the 20th century.<br>  <br>  Organized crime is lucrative. The 1967 President's Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice reckoned that organized crime's income was twice that of the combined take of all other kinds of criminal behavior.<br>  <br>  In 1970, Congress passed the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Congress's aim was to neutralize the deleterious effects of organized crime (basically, the Mafia) on the national economy. According to its criteria, the target of the RICO Act (defendant) is the kingpin. The racketeering activity is the unlawful activity in which the Mafia is involved. Thanks to the Mafia family's long-term involvement in that activity, it constitutes a pattern of racketeering. The government can therefore prosecute the kingpin under RICO and send him to prison — even if he has never directly participated in criminal behavior. The kingpin can be incarcerated because he operated a criminal enterprise. <br>  <br>  In 1972, the Knapp Commission revealed connections between organized crime and New York City police, which emphasized the difficulty local police organizations have with steering clear of its intimidating influence.<br>  <br>  In 1988, a report on La Cosa Nostra indicated that bribing union and public officials was still going on and conferences to resolve disagreements were held from time to time by the 25 member families. <br>  <br>  The structure of recent organized crime evidently resembles that of multinational corporations; indications are that it has diversified and even cultivated a multinational commodities market. Chinese, Latino and other ethnic groups have broken into organized crime in U.S. cities through the distribution and sale of illicit drugs. Such white-collar crimes as sales of phony phone cards, stock swindles and health insurance fraud have been added to the Mob's traditional loan shark and gambling activities. Meanwhile, such blue-collar crimes as rackets and extortion apparently are on the wane. The latest crimes of choice for racketeering are identity theft and online extortion.

OHTeRwSuaa	Hmm, that's hard. She could represent so many things. <br>  <br>  She's probably most representative of wealth and the upper class. You could say she represents materialism, she always wants things, she doesn't care much about anything else. <br>  <br>  We just finished this book in my English class, and that's what my teacher kept mentioning.

Scott Fitzgerald <br>  <br>  About Daisy Buchanan<br>  <br>  Daisy may be a "nice girl," but she's also weak-willed, foolish, and an incredibly needy chick. You can tell she's used to being the belle of the ball (a fact confirmed by Jordan's story), that she married a rich, athletic, aggressive man for those qualities, and that she's spoiled enough to leave her messes behind, as Nick points out, for others to clean up. <br>  <br>  <br>  So the natural question is, what could Gatsby possibly see in this girl? The cynical answer is that Daisy is the flesh-and-blood equivalent of everything that Gatsby wants: class and a solid stack of Benjamins. Since we know Gatsby's transition to the upper social echelon is thus far incomplete, maybe she is the final step; maybe she is his ticket to elitism. Daisy is, after all, largely defined by money: she's the "golden girl," Nick says, and as Gatsby so clearly puts it, "Her voice is full of money."

I mean, without ANY sensory input to give me a boundary and point of reference for being this "me" point of view, and without any neuronal firing to give my thoughts pattern, any consciousness that was still around would be transformed. If consciousness persists, it can't be with ego - there could be no location or sense of self, no conscious identification with a point of view or a thought or a dream or an idea ... anything that persisted would have to expand infinitely.<br>  <br>  It'd be like returning to before birth -- we're born with no sense of separation between self and world, and we have to gradually learn to interpret ourselves as a point of view or ego, because we're in a body. If we never had sensory input, we would never develop a point of view, never have a dream or a thought we could call our own or say was "me." So take away the body and all that has to go, too. No fear is justified =D|`|HCF0ate1aa	I don't think you're right, because staring, loneliness, intellect, hope, companionship, boredom, insanity, delusions, fantasy, etc. are all conditions of life, not death.

AA11607373	Yes.<br>  <br>  I don't like dumbing down conversations so that people understand them. I simply stop talking because its a waste of breath. Good looks might catch one's attention, but they won't keep it.|`|FoIxsunVaa	No, but good looks are fleeting, so if you don't make it you might need a back-up plan.|`|F5v5Qme0aa	Good looks help get you in the door, but they don't carry you through executing things that take education and experience to accomplish. Everybody wants to look at a pretty face, but pretty faces have brains too. Who would settle for a beautiful fool when there are so many beautiful scolars? Being pretty no longer means you can't be smart and I know a lot of gorgeous, sucessful, powerful, women.  Why not try to be one of them? <br>  <br>  In the end, our bodies all get old and what matters is what's between our ears, not between our legs.  Because if you think all men are going to want to look at is your pretty face, you are in for a rude awakening.|`|tKFO3u60aa	I disagree. I think looks can only get you so far, and, frankly, I wouldn't like to think that it was only my looks that got me the promotion, or the attention of a top manager. I think that intelligence and creativity go much father. Take a look at our world leaders, both politically and morally. Not many of them are extremely good looking, no offense to them. They made it up through their talents, not by just looking pretty and smiling. The pretty people (or the people who pay to become pretty) probably aren't very secure about themselves once their looks drop, which, eventually, they will. Of course, so does your mind, and emotional stability, etc. My point is, you need more than looks to make a life.|`|spYpsixUaa	I'll answer by examples:  I'm having trouble taking you seriously with that cartoon avatar you are wearing.  However, to the guy who dreams about such a basic pen-and-ink representation of humanity, the fortunate thing about your avatar is that it will never age like you will.  All the things that are beautiful about you will fade as you age.  What works for you now will fail to reap the same benefits as you age.  Along with your kidneys--dehydration can be hard on those beans.  Nip and Tuck will only push the waning years so far into the future . . .<br>  <br>  Nope, I've gotta side with those who say that brain removal can be fatal.  You must carry intelligence and experience into any endeavor or you will be thrown out once they find out that you are nothing but pretty.|`|LsBS5bOCaa	Good looks for the entertainment industry.....eventually yes, but may not be always promising in the end. Good looks for a successful relationship....NO - DOUBLE NO.  It all depends on where your going in life and the kind of people you accompany, where some form of looks may matter....may matter.  But since you're one of those that believe looks is everything and you are totally banking on that all the way......your setting yourself up for a hard dose of reality very soon.  Its a very dangerous way to think.  Looks, alone, can only take you but so far, whereas mind strength last.  The beauty and brain (or at least common sense, self-confidence, and true talent) combination is a highly more powerful vessel. Highly more powerful in ways you can't imagine, girl.  You'll learn.|`|3d7413e991732aa7cbba574864c37217aa	I'm female. I think there are advantages and disadvantages to everything ... in general I think we are really very aware of the advantages to being good looking, and not so tuned in to the downside. <br>  <br>  I think the irony is, that good looks ARE all it takes --as long as the good looking person doesn't actually believe that it is so. If you try to let good looks carry you, you're screwed... you become more superficial and incompetent, and unhappy, in all areas, the more you rely on being attractive. (And that doesn't necessarily improve even after your looks are gone. )|`|JvOL7y2Kaa	It really really depends on how good looking you are.  But if you are in the 'good looking' range, you are already walking a much smoother road unless you get way too many ppl being jealous of your looks.<br>  <br>  But yes and no to your question.  <br>  <br>  Brad Pitt was an extra for the longest time before he became a sex symbol and of course as you can see some of our most popular stars or successful individuals out there are no where near the 'good looking' vicinity.|`|aSYtykbFaa	you'd be a fool not to know looks matter in this world, but there are many other things that also contribute to how well and how far you go in life. you have to be confident. people who know they are valuable and are confident about their opinions gain respect and loyalty from others, and from these come opportunities. you also must be smart enough to recognize and take advantage of opportunities when they arise! <br>  there are many ways to achieve the same ends, as they say.|`|9cBAUMnNaa	Wow, how shallow can you get?<br>  <br>  That being said..... Very attractive people can have mental problems, personal tragedies, failed marriages, lose jobs and plenty of other devastating issues. <br>  <br>  Take a look at celebrities. Lots of them are beautiful people but even they have problems. No one is immune to heartache. Look at the lives of people you consider to be successful. Are their live free from problems? Are they happy? How many ugly people have been successful? Look at Bill Gates and every single US president we've ever had. Not exactly beautiful people but they had the brains to become ruler of this powerful country.<br>  <br>  There are no lucky charms in this life. No matter what you look, like, what or who you know, it takes hard work to achieve your goals, to follow your dreams or simply get what you want in life.|`|VlMSFub2aa	It depends on how you want to make it.  There can be a beautiful criminal, and if he is a complete idiot he will get captured and imprisoned, probably.  Studies have shown that attractive people get treated and perceived differently than others, (to their benefit).  Being attractive is most definitely an asset because though not everyone JUDGES a book by it's cover, the cover is what get's you intersted in reading the book in the first place.|`|QlXhPFSwaa	it helps if you plan to use your body to get you where you wanna go. but fugly people with kick *** sexy body can do that too.  but ultimately it is your brain, personality, talent and confidence that will get you far far and away no matter how hideously looking you are. case in point: mick jagger, william hung(well at least he got his MORE than 15 min. of fame)|`|QfwXEAl2aa	I don't think that's true. You need to be smart. I can't stand even being around idiotic people. I don't mean to offend anyone, but looks honestly wont get you everywhere! If you want to be lets say a psychiatrist.... they're not going to hire you because they think you look good.<br>  It may be part of the reason e.i good hygiene etcetera, but you deffinitely need brains.|`|eVZIqtgPaa	good looks take u one step ahead.. but that doesn't win u the race if u stand still after that..

35GfsJ3Paa	For the best pricing, don't sell online. People generally don't pay as much for instruments online as they do in person, because you can't try the clarinet before buying it if it's online.<br>  <br>  Take the clarinet to a reputable repair person and make sure there are no problems (leaky pads, bend keys, loose screws) and then put up some ads in band programs around your area. Also contact local clarinet teachers - they will know a good price for which to sell it and they may also know of someone who will want to buy it. Always let an interested person play the clarinet before they commit to purchasing it. <br>  <br>  Take your time in deciding which of your two clarinets is better - check the tuning of both in all registers, find which has better tone and appropriate resistance. <br>  <br>  Sometimes music stores buy used instruments, so check with several. Shop around to see who will give you the best price.
y8bFwXZEaa	An "asset" is something of value. As a man speaking of women AND men, I think it is an asset only to the person who retains their virginity only to the degree that it means they have not found the right person to lose it to.<br>  <br>  Losing it is not so much a gift to the person you lose it to, as saving it is a gift to yourself. It is something you only have once; it is the metaphorical and sometimes the literal end of innocence; and the person who takes it ought to mean something moral to you.<br>  <br>  On the other hand, many people give it away to prove to themselves their own lack of self-esteem. So, the "right person to lose it to" becomes a metaphysical endeavor.<br>  <br>  Ayn Rand wrote that if she got to know a man's soul, she could predict the kind of woman he would sleep with, because she understood (and taught) this metaphysical phenomenon.<br>  <br>  She made an art of this kind of prediction in her books. In We The Living, the heroine sleeps with a Young Communist as his whore, because she has a secret lover, a resistance fighter against the Soviet system, who has emphysema. She uses the money from the Young Communist so her boyfriend can go on fighting the Communists. <br>  <br>  In The Fountainhead, the heroine has little or no self-esteem--so she thinks; she therefore sleeps with the most immoral men she can find, in order to punish herself, much as a "cutter" punishes him or herself, or a flaggelist whips himself to rid himself of his unholy sins. Then the heroine meets the man who teaches her she has been wrong, and her entire attitude changes into a woman of pride, self-esteem, and self-assurance, because he teaches her she is worthy of better men.<br>  <br>  In Atlas Shrugged, our heroine gives herself only to the men she most admires. Through her life as we see it in the book it is only three men, and she remains true to each of them for as long as the relationship can last. In the first case she ditches the guy (and he ditches her) because he becomes a worthless playboy. In the second case, she meets the thirds man and can no longer love the 2nd man because the 3rd man represents a higher value to her.<br>  <br>  There is a real life story that matches that last one. When Amy Grant and Vince Gill met each other, they each knew that they were higher values to each other than their spouses were to them. They divorced their spouses and married each other.<br>  <br>  So whether or not you still have your virginity really isn't the point--except for the first time; whether you have it or not, giving away one's sex still remains a high value to the person who highly values him or herself--or who uses sex as a weapon against him/herself.|`|AA11564934	depends on the culture|`|yRZuoyPXaa	Asset.  After marriage.|`|onkUcy19aa	Why it should matter is hard to say. The converse is certainly not the case. Female virginity is rarely a turn-off for men and in many cultures it is a prized asset. No guy ever blew himself up for 72 crack whores. But women do seem to prefer to sleep with someone who has experience. This of course becomes something of a Catch 22. It's not so bad when you're 16 and everybody's a virgin. But when you get into your twenties it becomes an issue. And there's no self-correcting mechanism at work. Like marriage for women in the 19th century, it seems that the longer you leave it, the less likely it will happen.<br>  <br>  Lost virginity can be restored. Surgical repair to the hymenal ring ...<br>  allows an amazing exchange to take place, like the total merger of assets. Not even a girl who has always had an intact hymen is sinless.|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	No, just because you have no sexual experience will not make you special, nor losing it will.

When one has sexual intercourse, one's soul is very much involved.  This is termed "making love," as love arises via sexual arousal.<br>  <br>  A relationship is in love if the couple are able to sit at a dinner table and love each other, without having to bring in sexuality.<br>  <br>  When one gives one's childlike soul energies in sexual uniion, there is a series of memories and emotions which are vivid.  If the partner is loving, the two become "one flesh," two people with one mutual lovingkindness.<br>  <br>  Virginity is an asset for males and females alike, as the inner sense is more pure and able to focus on the beloved, without having to go through various previous lovers' energies.

ceBTTCPwaa	The Great Gatsby is a novel by the American author F. Scott Fitzgerald. First published on April 10, 1925, it is set in Long Island's North Shore and New York City during the summer of 1922.<br>  <br>  The novel chronicles an era that Fitzgerald himself dubbed the "Jazz Age". Following the shock and chaos of World War I, American society enjoyed unprecedented levels of prosperity during the "roaring" 1920s as the economy soared. At the same time, Prohibition, the ban on the sale and manufacture of alcohol as mandated by the Eighteenth Amendment, made millionaires out of bootleggers and led to an increase in organized crime. Although Fitzgerald, like Nick Carraway in his novel, idolized the riches and glamor of the age, he was uncomfortable with the unrestrained materialism and the lack of morality that went with it.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f..." rel="nofollow">http://www.shmoop.com/intro/literature/f...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/gatsby/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN..." rel="nofollow">http://www.cliffsnotes.com/WileyCDA/LitN...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby..." rel="nofollow">http://www.novelguide.com/thegreatgatsby...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl..." rel="nofollow">http://www.campusnut.com/book.cfm?articl...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T..." rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr..." rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/barr...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G..." rel="nofollow">http://www.bookwolf.com/Free_Booknotes/G...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.awerty.com/greatgp2.html</a>

It was considered an insult by the Water People, which was exactly why Timothy loved using it.<br>  <br>  “Timmy, they are just people!” Christina said, watching his silvery grey wings flutter - a clear sign he was angry. <br>  <br>  Even through she disliked the Water People herself, Christina thought Timothy went over the top with insults.

AA12343309	Dan, you would have to trace your ancestry going back one generation at a time.  There is no easy way.<br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene..." rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|an1b4pXxaa	Mary Queen of Scots was born in 1542, and Stuart is a pretty common surname so I would say that it is highly unlikely that you are related to her. Families often have those sort of  stories and most of the time they start with someone getting hold of the wrong end of the stick.<br>  Even if you are related it would be almost impossible to trace your line to her because records between the 1500s and the 1800s are pretty thin on the ground.<br>  However it is interesting to trace your family even if it turns out that you are not related to royalty. Ask grandma everything she can remember about her parents, grandparents and any other relative and write it all down. Make sure you do it before she passes on or that opportunity will be lost forever.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	one unfortunate "old" thought on genealogy... is the assuming that if you have the same last name, you *must* be related. Pass that down 4-5 generations, and it is accepted as fact, when they have nothing at all to support it. <br>  I can't give you any shortcut to finding your ancestry.. and shortcuts often send you in the WRONG DIRECTION, anyway. If you really want accuracy, the standard is that you HAVE TO PROVE each step of the research. <br>  In fact.. THAT is not as hard as it sounds. Your birth certificate is the first step, and proves your parents. And.. you are laughing. Why PROVE what you already "know"?? Because you will get to where no one "knows", and by that time, you will be in the habit of not accepting false information. Next.. document your parents to their parents. In early research, you will not find documents online for living family.. for privacy and preventing id theft. You have to do the early part within the home, although you might find SOME records online. Example could be a grandparent who has died and the obit names your parent (these can have errors, by the way).<br>  Keep going, and you will find (as you go) that there are different types of documents/ records for different places and time frames. Each will be unique to the person(s). You will reach the point that you have the "immigrant" ancestor, and will shift to their country of birth. <br>  No one can predict that you will prove that there IS a relationship.. but what is possible is that the ONES YOU IDENTIFY CAN BE PROVEN.  You thus WILL be certain of those. If it happens that you tap into one of the Royal lines, most of those have been worked and documented. <br>  Finally, just a heads up.. many many families have tradition of being related to royalty, Cherokee "princesses", or famous persons. In a huge number of cases.. this is simply what people want to believe, and have not bothered with doing the research to confirm it. Many of them are false stories.

AA12302854	I think you're from the Philippines and you mean "sovereignty". Right?<br>  In a nutshell, Thailand was always an independent kingdom and at first they had to fight off Burmese influence so that they don't become vassals of the kingdoms in what is now Myanmar. Afterwards, they had wise rulers who managed to allow Western goods and people to come in and still remain on equal terms with the Wesrtern powers. Does this answer your question?

Geisha are not just there as sexual objects but are the very definition of 'beauty' and tradition.  Men flock to them and try to present their best front and seek out the most beautiful the most intelligent and the most worthy.

AA10155323	Since the first two didn't gave you enough information. the other is good.<br>  I just wan to add few things.<br>  I don't know how much you know about oil painting. If you don't know anything about oil painting. I suggested you get a beginner book or take a beginner class.It teach you how to mix colors.how to take care and clean you brushes<br>  Those thinner are very toxic, always wear rubber gloves to protect you hands and fingers.You don't want  turpentine into your blood systems|`|ee2eb688bade7663b57e940f752dc454aa	Turpentine is very toxic. We use (less poisonous) white spirit (odor-free kinds are available) to thin paints and clean brushes, palettes, etc.<br>  Work from dark to light, thin to thick. The darkest or lightest tones and purest colors bring out form and create depth. Closer objects are purer, brighter colors; distance 'dulls' colors, so very subtlely ' greying' the background creates depth.<br>  The size and intensity of your brush strokes, thickness of paint and sharpness of image also create distance. Bigger strokes, thicker paint, sharper lines = closer.<br>  Very lightly in a pale color (oils) 'sketch' whatever you're painting on your canvas. Then slowly start building up a total image, background and foreground at the same time (working from dark to light).<br>  Create shadow by using complementary colors (you can figure out the complement by staring at the color you're using for a minute or so, then immediately looking at a white surface where the complementary color will 'magically' appear. For example, the complement of red is green.)<br>  Make your own black from complementary colors. Burnt siena and ultramarine blue make a great, vibrant black and with added white produce all shades of grey. <br>  Finally, and most important, remember the old saw: "Rome wasn't built in a day." or to put an art spin on it, Leonardo didn't paint the Mona Lisa his first time out. Simply, start painting. The more you do it, the more you'll learn.<br>  Enjoy!|`|buS9i5T4aa	You must have turpentine, as well as linseed oil. Make sure your brushes are cleaned after each use or you will ruin your brushes. Also, when painting, since oil paints do take a long time to dry you have to be careful that your colors do not become muddy while painting. Keep in dust free area as oil paints take a long time to dry and if you can't stand fumes make sure you use a face mask. If you don't have the patience for oils, use acrylics.|`|b5B53eTPaa	Since you are the artist YOU decide how to apply the paint in YOUR style.|`|AA11960951	The best way I can really help you in detail and give you examples is if you go to one of my certain pages that will explain more about working with oils compared to other paints hope this helps: <a href="http://www.pets-of-the-realm.com/oil-painting-instruction.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pets-of-the-realm.com/oil-pai...</a>|`|z1ZSiazQaa	get a paintbrush canvas or use yo fingers like oil pastels|`|AA11898755	Kudos to Zetsu!<br>  Also consider applying the paint itself as if it is part of an old Polaroid photo...developing slowly in front of your eyes. Don't start with any medium ( extra oil) or too much paint. Oil paints are like cats and children...the more you have to handle the harder it is to control! Get used to "dry brush" painting first...using only a little bit of paint on the brush at a time. Get used to the feel of it. Don't pay attention to your hand and how it moves - in other words don't try to "look like a painter" just pay attention to the way the image looks on the canvas. Soft and loose at first, becoming clearer and more defined over time. As you adjust to the way the paint interacts with itself you'll begin to have ideas of your own about how to make your personal statement and style come forth. You'll get used to using exactly the amount of paint - a lot or a little - that gives you the feeling you like. Its like any language so be patient with yourself....you have to learn the vowels and consonant, then words and finally you start to sing on your own in another tongue.|`|3ERx4opSaa	ok dont listen to the first two answers, their wrong,<br>  <br>  now you also need turpentine, a solevent strong enough to extract oil from your brushes, if you dont have it, your brushes will be ruined. also consider a paper pallete or paper plate to put your paints on and mix them. Also, oils take a long time to dry, 2-6 days depending on the brand, so store your painting when your done inside to prevent dust from collecting on it. also, you should buy a palette knife to mix colors with, as some are quite thick, and difficult to mix with a brush. turpentine is a toxic substance, so use it in a well ventilated area to prevent harmful exposure.<br>  <br>  have fun painting.

In NY, it's usually the same but with Theatre being higher up than Film/TV (/ denotes column breaks):<br>  <br>  At the top and centered:<br>  Name (Centered and is largest in font size)<br>  Union affiliation (if any)<br>  CELL Phone Number<br>  Email<br>  <br>  Far Left side below the top and centered stuff:<br>  Height <br>  Weight<br>  Hair color<br>  Eye color<br>  <br>  Right side opposite of statistics:<br>  Agent logo with contact info (sometimes if you have an agent, you can remove your own cell phone and email address. Then weirdos that find your stuff in the dumpster can contact them instead of you)<br>  <br>  Film<br>  Title/(Lead, supporting, featured)/Director<br>  <br>  Television<br>  Title/(Lead, guest star, co-star, regular, featured)/Network<br>  <br>  Theatre<br>  Title/Specific character played/Production company or director depending on who is more prestigious.<br>  <br>  Commericials<br>  ALWAYS put "List available upon request!" Do keep a separate list of the commercials with the Casting directors involved in case an agent asks.<br>  <br>  Training<br>  Skill learned/School or teacher/Location (LA, NY?)<br>  OR<br>  Skill learned/Teacher/School Location<br>  ie. Cold Reading/Margie Haber/Margie Haber Studios, LA,CA<br>  <br>  Special Skills/Abilities<br>  Be creative with this. When I was starting out and interviewing with agencies, they would usually go straight there and talk about my special talents and even had me demonstrate some of them<br>  <br>  DON'T:<br>  -Put extra work<br>  -Put Modeling/Print gigs. You make a separate resume for that.<br>  -Lie<br>  -Put age. If an agent asks you when you meet with him or her, then tell the truth. It's for legal reasons. ie. Under 18 can't work normal hours or you have to be at least 25 to do a beer commercial.<br>  -Put your home phone number or address unless you want weirdos coming to your house.<br>  -Put dates. It ages you!<br>  -Have it separate from your headshot. It should be cut to fit and stapled to the back of your headshot.<br>  <br>  If you don't have many credits on your resume, show that you're serious by having a lot of training from the best and unique Special Skills/Abilities.|`|3mAgM405aa	Besides setting all margins to 1", the most important criteria for setting up a professional resume besides relevant text, is "scanability." Here are some helpful tips:<br>  <br>  1. Place just below your identification header [your hame, address, phone, email address] any Conditional Warning Statement such as "Confidential Resume,"Do Not Contact Current Employer," etc.<br>  2. Always fill-in an Objectives category [just below the Conditional Warning Statement] and make sure that he Objective will contribute to the profitability of your future employer;<br>  3. Select a mono-type font such as Helvetica, Arial, Courier or Times Roman; do not select any cursive handwriting styles which cannot scanned;<br>  4. Keep font sizes within a range of 10 to 12 pts.;<br>  5. Avoid styling text with a justified alignment, keep it flushed left;<br>  6. Instead of using tabs to set up blocked text entries, generate a table and use the column and row settings accordingly;<br>  7. Do not place an i.d. picture anywhere on the resume, this is a major taboo due to discrimination issues;<br>  8. Do not place any graphic text [saved as .gifs] onto the resume since it may be overlooked during the scanning phase;<br>  9. List at the very end of the resume your interests which should include travel experiences, language skills, social interactions such as golf, team sports, tennis, etc.<br>  <br>  In conclusion, the above helpful hints were designed to allow ease of scanning of your resume into PDF which can then be text captured for seach purposes by your potential employer. If the original resume was created in Word, WordPerfect or Mac Appleworks, it can be Saved As a PDF file which then can be saved as an email attachment. Otherwise, you can simply use a scanner and scan a hard copy of the resume and then save as a PDF file. <br>  <br>  Failure to conform the resume to appropriate fonts and styles as outlined above will result in rejection of the resume simply due to the inability of the scanning device to properly index relevant resume entries.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|g9gGSfWVaa	<a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_2285204_make-acting-resume.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_2285204_make-act...</a>

Join a drama class, do community plays, and start building a portfolio. This will take years before you can go professional. You must be extremely dedicated and acting must become your entire LIFE. When you're sure that your ready, try to find an agent who will be able to get you auditions. First try for small parts in movies or shows, then move on to something bigger.

draNVjbkaa	SCAM O'RAMA! Kristen Stewart did NOT waste her money at John Casablancas.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas, John Robert Powers, and Barbizon are all SCAMS! They are NOT agencies! They MISLEAD people into thinking that they are, but are NOT. LEGIT Agencies only make money when you do (10% for film/tv and commercials, 20% for commercial print). REAL AGENTS DON'T take $2000 upfront and DON'T make you take their subpar classes.<br>  <br>  A school for modeling is the biggest scam, period! When you get picked up by a LEGIT agency like Ford or Elite, they will teach you or hire coaches. They're not going to reject your resume because "oh, you don't have any modeling classes." <br>  <br>  If you don't think they're scams, then go waste thousands of dollars that could go towards good headshots and training from the BEST schools (JRP, JC, and Barb. are NOT the best!) Also, go to a major market like L.A. or N.Y. with those schools on your resume. You'll get LAUGHED out!<br>  <br>  Schools like Barbizon, JRP, and JC still exist because there are a lot of suckers trying to get into acting and for the money. They think that going to one school will be the answer and it's not. It's these schools that give them and feed off of those false promises. For every 100 people that go through these scammy schools and lose their money, there will always be that naturally talented kid that gets work and that these scammy schools take credit for. <br>  <br>  JRP-Banks on the name of a very famous and DEAD agent. They say that Lucille Ball, John Wayne, Barbara Walters, Heather Locklear, Peter Fonda, Jane Fonda, and many other famous actors went to the school, when NONE of them did! Some of those celebs even threatened legal action for using their names. So you see, they use bait and switch tactics.<br>  <br>  John Casablancas-The franchises have been known for unethical business practices and really have nothing to do with the founder's original intentions.<br>  <br>  Barbizon-It was legit back in the 70s and 80s. Now these franchises have been known for unethical business practices and false promises.<br>  <br>  These schools are OVERPRICED and DON'T provide the caliber training that more affordable and REPUTABLE schools like Howard Fine Studios, Ivanna Chubbuck, TVI Studios, Groundlings, Second City, Beverly Hills Playhouse, Stella Adler, William Esper Studios, Tom Todoroff, Joanne Baron/D.W. Brown, Margie Haber, etc. do.<br>  <br>  Go look those schools up! They are all respected by the industry and LEGIT!|`|Iswn8gXiaa	Kristen Stewart has been acting since she was 12. she played Jodie Fosters daughter in Panic Room. also her dad is a Fox TV Producer<br>  <br>  most likely this is all a scam. <br>  <br>  you want to act, go to a theater and practic<br>  <br>  acting is not a skill you are born with or get lucky with, it takes practic, studying, and patience.<br>  <br>  Kristen Stewart was lucky but i can still tell she takes it seriously and works for her roles|`|fbd87c7846199694ba9130c99b6e261caa	Yes, John Casablanca's is a school not an agent. Their full name is actually John Casablancas modeling and career centers, and all they are is an over priced school that will rip you off.  Sadly the way they pull people in as by making their big claims to fame ( such as Bella from Twilight.") They know the youngest (and sadly gullible) out there are all fans of that movie and therefore that is the hook they will use. Notice how their ads change to represent what ever is hot at the time. Last year I believe it was people from Hannah Montana.<br>  <br>  Don't respond to the postcard. Real agencies do not need to send out postcards trying to solicit people. People go to them, not the other way around. And they definitely don't need to sell themselves on people.|`|aKj4ZxAFaa	Im sorry about disapointing u, but john casablanca′s is scam!, so sorry, but u have to go to real good acting schools, u cant get to a acting agency without a resume, u have to make it, u can make it, with  school plays, theather community, skills like dancing, singing, ice skating, swiming, gimanstic skills and all that, just try!,  when u get ur resume u can go to an agent agency, and there u will get a callback, good luck and good bye!|`|S01zIagOaa	Yes, and as many actors go through many false starts as they learn the industry, it's entirely likely that all manner of accomplished actors have had the misfortune of stumbling into one of these fly traps. There really is no such thing as "discovery", but success is really achieved through a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly progression of proper steps being taken.|`|f696776b941b55b420115b639c09c57aaa	John Casablanca's is an acting/modeling school not a talent agency.<br>   <br>  They will take anybody who is willing to pay for their overpriced classes and photography.<br>  <br>  A REAL agent makes money by taking a percentage of work they find for you.|`|OrtnseWfaa	Yea its a scam.

gje8bfFgaa	Well, if you really want to answer that question fairly, than you need to look at what most other artists at that time were producing, and I do mean MOST other artists - not just the exceptional artists of that such as Cezanne or Guaguin.<br>  <br>  If you do do that than you'll see just how very unusual, unfinished and frankly weird van Gogh's art must have appeared to most other artists, art dealers and clients. It was so very different from what most people called "good" art that the conclusion most came to was that what van Gogh was producing must have been "bad" art. It would have taken someone with an exceptionally good eye to recognise that rather than being bad, van Gogh's art was revolutionary.<br>  <br>  Added to that was his terrible reputation. Given van Gogh's well reported mental health problems, it was all the easier to dismiss his swirling masses of paint as the outpourings of a lunatic, not a great artist.<br>  <br>  It would be just as easy to mis-label a potentially great artist as terrible today as well, so don't be too quick to judge harshly van Gogh's contemporaries.|`|pWoMaxwkaa	They thought too much of themselves and since he had a new signature look to his work , they didnt know what to do with it<br>  whether to be disgusted because its different<br>  or to embrace it because its different.<br>  That happened to many great artists too ; Pablo Piccaso , Leonardo.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	His style was new and I'm pretty sure he was probably a bit odd, but his brother saw value in him just by being his brother.|`|kBBFbTPiaa	because he was a nobody!|`|Bina7xS1aa	they didn't think his art was art..it was too gaudy for them

AA12343309	You have to trace your ancestry.  You just can't put in a name and "there it all is."  Anybody that has told you that they found in a family tree on the internet that they are related to some notable person and they have not checked it out with DOCUMENTS/RECORDS doesn't know whether it is true or not.<br>  <br>  On Ancestry.Com they will do that with your family tree if you have it in One World Tree. Ancestry.Com has 4 programs for family trees and One World Tree is the one that is absolute trash.  When they set it up they took information people had submitted to Ancestry World Tree and tried to combine all the info on one person into one page.  I have seen at least twice where they combined 2 people into 1.   I have deleted family members from that program because of that.<br>  <br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50genealogy2008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family trees.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|XzLUA7ataa	Ancestry.com will tell you about famous relatives, once you trace your family back a few generations.

If I don't think so then I thank them for their opinion and move on.  This has taken me many years and knocks to be able to move on and be proud of my work.  As most of my poems are written for ME.  It is hard to take criticism especially when it is construed to be nonconstructive.<br>  <br>  Of course the other way of looking at it is that the person who made the comment in the first place might be a total 'beep' head in which case their opinion doesn't count anyway!

It has a central theme with a substantial message (and pretty much everything in its considerably long run time is relevant to that message, no small feat), dynamic and relatable characters, and it has great music to boot.

The hardest part of learning to draw manga-style art is relearning proportions as those of drawing photo-realistic faces are not exactly the same.

We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50genealogy2008.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.

yP9qx2f9aa	I have a couple for you, that I got off of a website. They are all by Keena Lindsay. <br>  <br>  Sleeping Beauty:<br>  Hello. My name is Rose, but you may know me better as "Sleeping Beauty." I just have a few things I want to get out in the open. You know, ever since that stupid prince woke me up, I have been getting a lot of grief from a lot of people who have no right sticking their noses into my business. Everyone seems to think that just because some guy kissed me and woke me up, I should marry him. As if. I was just lying there, minding my own business, having a pleasant dream - as I had been for the past one hundred years - when "Prince Charming" decides to take it upon himself to plant one on me and bring me into a conscious state. I barely know him. I'm not going to marry someone I hardly know. <br>  And then, there's the matter of his last name. Think about it. How would you like to spend the rest of your life as Mrs. Charming? Ugh. Just thinking about that disgustingly sweet name makes me want to puke! No way am I getting a joint bank account with that name. Think of how our poor children would be teased. Think of the jokes at the PTA meetings. What a life I would lead! If you think I'm obnoxious now, imagine how I'd be after a few years as Mrs. Charming. <br>  And, of course, we mustn't forget the fact that I'm already betrothed. Now don't look at me like that. I know it's been a hundred years. Just because I was technically in a coma, doesn't mean I'm brain dead. I know he's dead. Quite dead in fact, but he does have descendants. I can just marry someone a little down the line. Okay, way down the line. I must stay true to my parents promise. Chivalry isn't that dead. <br>  Well, I'd better get going. I've got to go find a younger branch on my fiancée's family tree. But before I go, I just want to make one thing perfectly clear: just because someone breaks a spell that doesn't give them any claim to your future. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Goldilocks:<br>  Hi. My name is Goldilocks and I've been the victim of a bad rap all these years. Mothers always tell their children: "Don't be like Goldilocks. Don't be like Goldilocks." Well, I'd like you to hear my side of the story. <br>  I did walk into the Bears' house when they weren't home. I readily admit that, but they had this fancy schmancy sign on the door that said "Welcome". I'm no fool. I know what that word means. Bears speak with forked tongues and then make a big fuss when somebody believes their sign. <br>  And about that porridge. Porridge? (Shakes head, then nods on next line) Wallpaper paste with a few raisins in it. That stuff was awful! And notice they didn't like it either. They went off walking in the woods and left that sign as bait to help them get rid of it. <br>  I did break a chair. One chair. One cheap little chair that wouldn't even make it in a yard sale! Besides, they could always glue it back together with some of the leftover porridge. <br>  And then there were the beds. Beds they call them. Waterbeds with no water. No wonder those bears were always off walking in the woods, they were looking for a soft place to lay their heads and take a nap. So sue me, but get off my back! <br>  Well, anyway, thanks for listening. I just wanted to set the record straight. When you grow up and read to your children, be kind to Goldilocks. Tell them I wasn't such a bad kid. It's all the media's fault. <br>  <br>  <br>  Fairy Godmother:<br>  You'll excuse me for not doing the whole "appearing in a cloud of stardust" routine, but my back is killing me. Besides, stardust is expensive, and our budget just got cut. Whenever there are cutbacks in the Fairy Tale World, the magic department always feels it first. I wouldn't be surprised if there's a sudden outbreak of insomnia with all the way they butchered the Sandman's budget. <br>  Now I can't afford to buy a new wand. I have been waiting for months for that funding to come through. My old one has been in the shop twice in the past week. Of course, it's not because of cutbacks. It's an older model and that Cinderella character overloaded it! Boy, that girl really cracks my crystals! All I hear is whine, whine, whine. (In a mocking, whiny voice) "I need a coach. I need footmen and a groom. I need a dress." And just when I think it's all over: "I need shoes." So I gave her those glass slippers and I hope she has to walk over some rocky terrain! <br>  As if the annoying people at work weren't enough, I have to come home to my husband - The Fairy Godfather. Every time I ask him to run an errand for me, I get (doing The Godfather imitation), "Someday I will call upon you to do a favour for me." If I have to hear that line one more time, I swear I'll scream! But I give it right back to him. Every time we have a fight I tell him he can "sleep with the fishes" because he ain't gettin' in my bed! <br>  Well, I better go. I have to get my wings detailed. I just have one request. Please write a letter to the Queen of Hearts, you know, the head honcho, and ask her to give us a little slack in the ma

2TZ15Rafaa	The bottom a skateboard deck goes through a lot of stress so even professionally printed designs don't last forever. The most permanent result would probably come from a combination of using a wood stain and a varnish. The stain is messy and will probably not yield perfect results but it might actually embed the image in the surface deeper than typical printing. The varnish might affect the decks sliding qualities so you should probably test it out first. Used to be a deck company that produced boards with a plastic layer protecting the actual image so with any luck the varnish might imitate that to a lesser degree.

This will allow you to stand around 10-12ft away from your subject to give you some working room and will not give you any unflattering facial distortion that you would get from a wider angle lens such as a 50mm. You'll also get a nice bokeh.<br>  <br>  You would need to give us a budget for a lens recommendation.<br>  <br>  Be patient and do extensive research to find your best lens and spend as much as you can on it.

However, a decent zoom lens is much more versatile for the amateur photographer and if you do your research there are many that will give excellent results. In fact I believe many pros use a short zoom for portrait shots.<br>  <br>   It would be nice to have a prime lens for every situation but this is often impractical and if you begin to diversify you'll soon discover a prime lens can become quite restrictive. <br>  <br>  But if you do intend to use your lens predominately for portrait shots for a studio setup, then by all means chose a prime. They will give excellent sharp quality. But if you think you might eventually use it for other types of work too, or you intend to roam around with your camera taking impromptu people shots, go with the good quality zoom that has good reviews. Don't forget, if you use a prime you will need to physically move yourself or your subject to recompose your shot.<br>  <br>  At the end of the day, it's all a matter of how you intend to use the lens and how much you can afford to pay for it.<br>  <br>  My advice is to have a good think about it and then do your research. <br>  <br>  The best of luck with your photography.|`|1wzSq4OJaa	the 50mm f/1.8 is a tank.

eVptHOOBaa	The first picture was taken with a very strong back light. The light source is behind the girl and it is by several stops stronger than the face is illuminated, as a result the background is all blown out, and there's this soft effect on the picture. When taking this kind of shot, make sure you set your camera on spot metering, and meter just the face, but not the backlight. Otherwise the face will be dark, and light behind not bright enough to give you this look.<br>  <br>  Second one, also taken with backlight, not as strong, and the contrast was later bumped up. This is a guess though, as far as this second picture. To be honest I don't find it catching enough to try to reproduce this kind of shot....<br>  <br>  LEM.|`|6DbxNVhPaa	just make the brightness high!

U9wHEud9aa	A favorite family reunion idea that brings all ages together is a family Jigsaw Puzzle - even better if the jigsaw puzzle is personalized with pictures of your family members. This makes a great talking point and centre of attention on the coffee table and a great keepsake after the reunion is over.<br>  <br>  Just send the guys at www.jigsaw2order.com a selection of family photos - 15-25 images usually works best. You can also specify a title or other message to commemorate the event. Based on your photos and input, let the professional designers at jigsaw2order.com create a unique photo collage layout for your approval before making it into a puzzle. Don't worry, you get a chance to review and approve the photo collage design before they make a puzzle. Once completed, it can be framed and put on the wall as a keepsake of the reunion.|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	You could start a web site at MyFamily.com or Ancestry and have people contribute data and pictures. That would get them involved.<br>  <br>  Just a note - if you have music, make sure you turn it off frequently so people can talk. 15 minutes on, 30 off seems about right to me. The most frequent complaint I hear about high school reunions are that the DJ ruined it. People at reunions (family, high school, military . . .) like to talk. People don't like to talk above music.
5zUwuDWkaa	The stage door is where all those associated with putting on a play enter the theater. All the actors, technicians and musicians go through the stage door and in most cases they have to sign in to show that they're actually in the building. The stage-door keeper then knows who's in the building and can handle any inquiries from visitors to the theater. The stage-door is also the place where fans hang out when they're waiting for autographs or to take photographs of their favorite performers and, more recently, where actors and technicians who can't break themselves of the habit congregate to have a cigarette.

fbd64694a498c73d8b0c3ca90c37602aaa	Close.  The artist was hired to produce a painting, possibly on a specific subject, and the painting became the property of the person who commissioned it.  A famous example is the Sistine Chapel.  A commission is different from a painting which is done and then offered for sale in a gallery.|`|AA11960951	I will give you my example:<br>  <br>  Once I was commissioned by a man to do a sculpture of his family dog. Reason being that his wife, who was mad about the dog, and could not find any sculptures of this certain breed. So the husband came to me, with the dog once, and with some photos in hand. So that I could sculpt that particular dog.<br>  <br>  So its not just sculpting something, its usually has to do with recreating a likeness of a particular subject that means something to the person who has commissioned it. This applies to any art, painting and such.<br>  <br>  The only time this does not apply, if you are asked to do something just in subject only. Like the time I was commissioned to do a sculpture for a fly fishing competition. So it was only necessary to just sculpt a specific breed of fish.|`|buS9i5T4aa	To have worked commissioned means someone has hired you to do a specific piece of art work that they are willing to pay you for. The Roman Catholic Church hired Artist such as Leonardo Da Vinci and Botticelli to do commission work all the time.|`|FLAtdWrmaa	The buyer went to a painter and asked him/her to paint something fitting whatever limits the buyer specified -- size, portrait of X, abstract "for my living room, which is done in shades of green," less than $1000., whatever.  <br>  <br>  The buyer doesn't always want a specific subject in the painting (nor are they always paying money, or anything else); sometimes they know they'll want to have whatever the artist wants to paint -- but if the only reason the artist has to paint a particular painting is that this buyer asked them to paint it for them, then the painting is a "commissioned work."|`|3ERx4opSaa	normally, an artist goes about expressing his or her creative perception of the world in differnt paintings that he or she does on his or her own.<br>  <br>  a commission is when someone goes to that artist and sais, i want you to paint a portait, or landscape or any type of painting, and is willing to pay $x amount of cash.

pUlstVhxaa	Who decides a person is unrecognizable always best to get a signed release play it safe. Photo's taken in public places do not require a release in most cases it's public domain but if you are taking pictures of specific individuals and providing direction on how to position themselves (posing for you) get a release signed. When in doubt get a release it would be a shame if you got a great picture but couldn't use it for legal reasons.|`|v5n6VKpkaa	You need a photo release when publishing a photo may be construed as breaking someone's right, such as a right of privacy or when mandated by other applicable legislation.  <br>  <br>  Rights of privacy laws vary from place to place so there is unfortunately no blanket answer.  Whether or not people have an expectation of privacy is a good general guideline, but not absolute.  The end use also matters.   If it's for commercial gain, such as advertising, you may need a release, even if the images are taken in public.   It's unlike you would for purposes of commentary or news.<br>  <br>  If the person is unrecognizeable, and you don't identify who it is, you most probably do not need a release.<br>  <br>  There are a few ways to organize that-   Attach copies or link them electronically to each photo, or record the names with each photo and file your releases alphabetically.|`|3mAgM405aa	No model release is required if your photo subjects are on public thoroughfares, streets, alleys, sidewalks and most importantly, they are not depicted in any derogatory manner.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|VMVW3E7Aaa	If you're going to make money from it, then yes - every recognizable person needs to sign a model release.

BBfIXcI0aa	Do the audition notices say "must be able to cry"? If not, I wouldn't. You'll likely be doing a monologue, and there just isn't enough time there to build up that kind of emotional steam. You want a piece that shows how well you can plug into a character and fight for his or her goals. If you, as that character, happen to tear up, then that's fine, but you don't want to force it.|`|PpKJIT0aaa	Dive into your fear of NOT being able to do it when you need to; that may produce the tears.

I've seen RENT onstage with the national touring cast (not the original one, of course), and I must say, I thought it was kind of a mess - there's just too much going on. Now, I'll admit, it was largely due to the production - the blocking was terrible, there were people everywhere, and you frequently couldn't understand the actors even though they were miced. But if the NATIONAL TOURING SHOW is putting up a disaster, I think that says something about the script itself. I feel like the movie made the changes Larson might have found necessary after a run if he were still alive.|`|DZE9qzntaa	The movie is really well done, but upon seeing the actual play, I found the play much more moving. It also depends on who is performing the play-- Broadway vs. A poorly done high school version vs. A well done high school version.|`|MZNIG4zHaa	I love the movie, but the stage version is a hundred times better.  It's blocked out so artistically and powerfully.  There are more songs, and there's something just really amazing about hearing the music live.  You really feel a part of something beautiful.

ot6OJ7JWaa	I was always under the impression that it was 9.8 m/s^2? <br>  Regardless, have you heard about that story that was quite popular not too long about the MRI machines that could "read" peoples minds? If you hadn't, let me do a quick recap. People were put into these MRI-machines and shown different pictures. Almost all the time, when people were shown each picture the same parts in thier brains where triggered. And then it was reversed. The people were shown pictures, and the machines had to guess what the people were thinking based off of what parts of their brains where triggered. <br>  How does this relate? Well, you seem to be quite an intelligent person, maybe you can guess. <br>  We really aren't all that different in our thoughts. Are we capable of free thought? I think not. I believe that we are all people who have our lives created for us before they even start. Every thought, occurence, meeting of another being: previously planned. None of it is real. We have no 100% knowledge that my desk won't suddenly become a gas right now. We have no 100% knowledge of anything. So we "decide" to make laws of Physics that "Explain" things. We need it for our "sanity". For all you know, I could even not be real. I could just be "created" to make you "think" that you are capable of thought, while all the while you really aren't. <br>  Makes sense?|`|KqwloDo7aa	If by 'science', you mean the current paradigm within which scientific discovery is conducted by continually seeking answers to questions based on evidence that many of its practitioners (i.e. scientists) have validated, quantified, and repeated, then the answer to your question depends on what such "science" excludes from inquiry. Why? Because the practitioners of such 'science' do not recognize or understand the basis for 'evidence' that is outside their established paradigm. So they collectively (and reflexively) declare, "That event or phenomenon or concept (you fill in the blank) is not possible." Obviously such as stance is ripe for refutation by verifiable, repeatable, quantifiable evidence, even by rigorous adherence to the tenants of their OWN paradigm.<br>  <br>  The history of mankind’s exploration and discovery of both scientific and religiousTruth is replete with examples of this or that scientist or religious prelate pontificating that this or that phenomena is impossible.<br>  <br>  …..Only to be subsequently refuted by quantifiable, repeatable, verifiable evidence found by others with a set of different ideas that turned the paradigm of established scientific or religious consensus on its head. <br>  <br>  Do the Heavens still rotate around the Earth? Not after Galileo. Are time and space separate from one another? Not after Einstein. Did you get your vaccines this year? Thanks to Pasteur you did. Is the Earth still flat? Ask Erikson, Columbus or Magellan for the answer. Do you have to read this answer in the dark? Not after a little help from one of Edison’s great ideas. <br>  <br>  The Principles of Life uncovered by scientists that govern the relationship between mass, gravity, time, and the curvature of space to produce black holes have been in perfect operation just as eternally before their discovery of those principles as is the frequency upon which you enjoy listening to your favorite music; indeed, existent ever since the Universe cooled it into resonance along with the infinite gradations of frequency radiating beside it. These principles HAD to have been in operation just as perfectly BEFORE we discovered how to harness them into technology as they presently operate now. Or we would not be able to continue to utilize them for our technology today, much less build them into technological improvements tomorrow! <br>  <br>  This has to include spiritual principles. (And they operate perfectly whether or not you doubt or have faith in the Universe’s operation) From the standpoint of principle, then, understand that spiritual knowledge HAS ALSO been in perfect operation just as eternally BEFORE as AFTER our discovery and application. <br>  <br>  What we call miracles is NOT contravention of science. The accomplishment of miracles comes from a knowledge base that science has not yet incorporated into its paradigm of "what is possible". Such as stance is ripe for refutation by verifiable, repeatable, quantifiable evidence, as I mentioned before. The accomplishment of miracles is based on principles, too. And once you discover them in yourself (and they ARE waiting for you to do so) just as scientists have been "discovering" new ways of looking at the Universe, you, too will be able to utilize these principles to accomplish the very same things. <br>  <br>  Whether scientists, theologians, philosophers, or laypersons, we “see” through our ideas. We ALL are free to choose to believe that 2+2=5 for ETERNITY until we have acquired FOR OURSELVES the necessary knowledge of the immutable principle that correctly sums the answer.<br>  <br>  Don't believe me? Try MAKING 2+2=5. Doesn't work, does it? We can ONLY accept its perfect operation, because we CANNOT change Truth. <br>  <br>  In this manner, even a skeptical, hard-nosed, evidence-propounding scientist of the current paradigm of scientific discovery can learn to understand that the same Source Who created perfect principles of mathematics which operate undeviatingly to create ONLY 4 as the answer to 2+2, ALSO CREATED US out of perfect principles. Furthermore, he or she can validate that the correct application of such principles enables them to accomplish anything consistent with those principles.<br>  <br>  Though we were ALL lovingly and perfectly created by our Father with PERFECT qualities, WE HAVE CHOSEN TO PERCEIVE AND ACT as if the immutable Principles with which we were created could be utilized inconsistently with their original purpose. THAT is the problem.<br>  <br>  This is about G I G O...<br>  <br>  Garbage in, garbage out....perfectly !!<br>  <br>  Perfect input, perfect output....perfectly !!<br>  <br>  NOT BECAUSE there is inherent EVIL in US! <br>  <br>  NOT BECAUSE there is inherent EVIL in God's Creation. <br>  <br>  NOT BECAUSE we are flawed or "born in sin and full of sin".<br>  <br>  It is because this infinite SYSTEM was created by the same Source Who created perfect principles of Life, such as mathematics which operate undeviatingly to create ONLY 4 as the answer to 2+2.<br>  <br>  It is because the infinite SYSTEM of which we are an inseparable part operates flawlessly and impartially....<br>  <br>  ALL the principles of Life operate that way, perfectly, without variation, deviation, or attenuation for anyone, at anytime, anywhere !!<br>  <br>  Otherwise, you would not know what electricity perfectly does FOR you when you utilize it correctly. Or you wouldn't know what electricity perfectly does TO you when operated incorrectly, either. <br>  <br>  If you consider this carefully, what is referred to as, goodness including love, patience, kindness, self-control, faithfulness and gentleness", is analogous to what the immutable principle of electricity does FOR you when operated consistent with its purpose.<br>  <br>  Conversely, what is referred to as "The acts of our brokenness, hatred, discord, sexual immorality, dissensions, greed, laziness, hatred, jealousy, fits of rage, drunkenness, envy, selfish ambition and the like....." are analogous to what the immutable principle of electricity does TO you when it is operated incorrectly. <br>  <br>  So what does that have to do with us ?? It is all about OUR awareness and ignorance .<br>  <br>  As author Baird Spalding says in the reference, "Becoming aware of yourself as a spiritual being, offspring of an infinite spiritual system and one with all the powers and capacities within that system, is the very essence of attainment. To grow from the present state of awareness of himself as a material being and into the consciousness that he is a spiritual being contains the full secret of man's attainment.' <br>  <br>  Understand also that the same Source Who created perfect principles of mathematics which operate undeviatingly to create ONLY 4 as the answer also created US out of perfect principles, the correct application of which enables us to accomplish anything consistent with those principles. Furthermore, we can validate that the correct application of any principle enables us to accomplish anything consistent with that principle…..because the Principle is perfectly, eternally immutable. <br>  <br>  As Spiritual Beings created of the Spirit and as the Image of the Creator, Himself...so are WE perfectly, eternally immutable, as well.<br>  <br>  The answer to your question about beliefs is to realize that a false perception (a lie) believed can never be the Truth. It is still a lie….<br>  <br>  A lie (false perception) believed CAN NEVER be the Truth !! <br>  <br>  That is the lesson we can learn from Adam and Eve….<br>  <br>  Sin and evil is analogous to erroneously believing OR acting as if 2+2=4 AND equals 5 were the Truth, INSTEAD OF BEING A LIE.<br>  <br>  Truth and Perfection is as obvious as 2+2 can NEVER be 4 AND also 5.<br>  <br>  TRUTH is, and has been, TRUE BEFORE human beings even invented books, filled with scripture to fight over! <br>  <br>  TRUTH does not even NEED scripture or our disparate, "after the fact" interpretations to validate it!!<br>  <br>  PROVING TRUTH FOR YOURSELF is, and always has been, the acid test of validation.....regardless what you believe or what you call yourself.<br>  <br>  So what does mathematics have to do with an explanation of evil? Please understand that I am only using this mathematical example as a metaphor for THAT which is not only real, but is also true, and which ALSO cannot change.<br>  <br>  OUR OWN ignorance of the unchangeable, eternal Truth of ourselves (that we are perfectly created) is the DIRECT cause of sin and evil, PRECISELY like ignorance of the perfect operation of a mathematical equation ALWAYS and INVARIABLY produces incorrect results. There is an inescapable consequence to this perception, which is, simply, that you remain in error (in ignorance) of the truth, until you realize it AND act accordingly with it. <br>  <br>  As soon as we correct the error, that act ERASES the effect of the ignorance immediately so that we SEE and EXPERIENCE for ourselves the FACT which has been perfectly and ALWAYS true even BEFORE we were aware of our error.<br>  <br>  We see that the correct answer NEVER CHANGED AT ALL......nor, in all Reality, have we! Do you see?<br>  <br>  Don’t believe me? Try MAKING 2+2=5. Doesn’t work does it? We cannot even MAKE 2+2=4 either. <br>  <br>  Why? Because neither Truth NOR Perfection can change or BE changed. Is it not obvious that whether you KNOW or DO NOT KNOW that you are in error, and continue to proceed erroneously, anyway, that the correct answer (Truth) is not in the slightest bit affected? <br>  <br>  The truth about God is the same as truth about the perfect operation of a mathematical equation: the principles by which the equation works and by which Creation works are equally accessible and PROVABLE by any and all, whether an individual perceives these principles or not....<br>  <br>  THAT'S HOW you personally experience the immutable, perfect Truth of YOURSELF..... by direct experience OF IT (just like 2+2=4 or the "shock" of electricity is true). Then YOU KNOW the Truth, not merely believe "in" the Truth second-handedly.|`|pnoQFcT4aa	Simply because we may not be aware of a choice doesn't necessarily mean we haven't made one. Most choices are mad consciously but what if the others were routed in our subconscious? The mind itself takes in all sensory data but we are only ever aware of some of it - life would be intolerable if we were aware of all noise around us for example - so it would be fair to state that although we might not realise why we made a choice, we did however essentially make a choice.

r9s0VyJgaa	Quite frankly I don't know of any "poetry jobs" for anyone, teen or adult.  Its not exactly a 40-hour a week salaried occupation.  Unless maybe you work for Hallmark writing verses for greeting cards? I have no idea how someone goes about getting that job, or if they would hire a teen who lives in Chicago. <br>  <br>  AFAIK, most poets are free-lancers who maybe put together a bunch of poems together into a book and try to find a publisher.
TbTO5SXlaa	First, DO NOT - DO NOT - use alcohol or a moist towelette or a piece of cotton dipped in water. Take your camera to a real camera shop and ask their assistance. Then buy a lens cleaning cloth from them. If your lens can accept filters, buy a UV/Haze filter to protect the front element of your lens.<br>  <br>  If you'll look in the Owner's Manual for your camera you'll find a section on care and cleaning. It will tell you to never use alcohol on any part of your camera.|`|WJLl0d3Jaa	I used to troll people by telling them to use sandpaper and steel wool...but I'll be nice.<br>  <br>  Get a rocketblower thing and try to blast away as much of the crumbs/cheesy bits. Then use a microfibre cloth and gently clean the lens like you would a pair of eyeglasses. You can google for shops that carry these items, but your local camera/electronics store may have a cleaning set with them included.|`|HlQCmCG0aa	I could say something cheesy, like throw the lens away it has coodies, but if you use a soft cotton cloth dipped in warm water with a little bit of vinegar to gently clean off the big chunks and than use a gray cloth to polish off any remaining oils, that should do the trick<br>  <br>  You may want to buy a new gray cloth and stay away from children.|`|xYAuW0Wqaa	You can carefully remove any big chunks or particles from the lens. If you have a blower with brush, carefully dislodge anything that can scratch the lens. I always find that alcohol prep pads will safely remove almost anything from the lens. Then use a lint free cloth to dry the lens and see if that removed any of the oily finger prints from the lens.|`|e31a690779239ea8cd46fcbe573867d1aa	I suggest you don't put any liquid on your lens unless it is lens cleaning fluid. Vinegar may be fine for cleaning glasses but a camera lens is coated and acid can cause damage.

7FsbxYbgaa	This depends on how much money you are willing to spend and if you really do want it to be your last trumpet. Ebay can be great to find decent deals, but you loose the opportunity to test the instrument first, which is very important. In semi-professional/professional trumpet playing there are two big names that stand out. The Yamaha Xeno series and the Bach Stradivarius series. Both are very different and some people hate one but love the other. I own a Bach Strad ( LR180S37) and absolutely love it. I bought it new for 2400. The standard trumpet for college level students at my school is the Bach Strad LT180S37. The difference is the reversed leadpipe on my trumpet (LR). If you really want this to be a lifelong horn, save up and be willing to spend upwards of $1800. Used can be just as well and often better then new, it all depends on how you feel about it after you test it out. Bach's tend to be better vintage, and the Yamaha Xeno's are relatively new and don't have vintage models. Here is a link to all the Bach models. <a href="http://www.bachbrass.com/category.php?category=Trumpets" rel="nofollow">http://www.bachbrass.com/category.php?ca...</a>

If you look at the image with a light and some kind of viewer to see the picture, then it's a color slide (a postive image), not a negative. <br>  <br>  Yes, you CAN get slides scanned.  Pepole do it all the time.  Not EVERYTHING is digital, a lot of photographers do prefer to use film, and even color slide film like Velvia and Kodachrome.  Kodak is going to stop making Kodachrome film, but Velvia is still very popular and in fact Fuji has made a new version of it (Velvia 100).  Also, Kodak just made a new 35mm color film, called Ektar 100.  It's already been so popular that they're going to make it in 120 size film in April.<br>  <br>  You can get your slide scanned and prints made from it if you send it to a professional lab.  If you just take it to a 1-hour photo lab at Walmart, Walgreens, Target, etc the clueless clerks there won't have any idea what to do with it.

XWVgCy60aa	Its already great that she practices every day at home. If she can remember her corrections from her weekly practice and apply those to her home practice that would definitely improve her dancing ability. Make sure she stretches everyday as well. Theres not a lot more to do since she is already taking the time to practice. Practices like slowly going up on demi pointe (for example like going on your toes when you are trying top reach something from a high shelf)  will help strengthen her ankles, make sure she is all the way up on demi pointe tho not somewhere in the middle because that could damage her ankles. If she does it properly then it will strengthen her ankles and make her ready for pointe. If you arent sure just ask her what demi-pointe is and im sure she will know what you are talking about. :)<br>  its great that she has found something that she is passionate about..I know exactly how she feels :) She will grow up to be beautiful strong and confident :) <br>  hope i helped|`|uYJdvnqxaa	You may need to move her to a more professional studio.<br>  <br>  And something to add along with the person's answer,make sure her feet and hips are rotated out.If everything is turned in it won't have the same strenghthening effect.
UsTyc0oeaa	Look in your local Yellow Pages under "Clowns" or "Entertainers, Children and Family".  You probably won't find anyone advertising Leprechauns, but if you call a few and ask, you'll probably find someone.  Be warned, many will tell you that they CAN do it, even if they never have before, just to get your money.  Ask them if they ever HAVE done it before, and how many times, then ask who they did it for and if you can call that customer and ask them how well they did it.  (You're essentially putting this person through an audition before you shell out your hard earned money, so don't be afraid to sound nosey.)  Ask them if they have a costume and if they can show you a picture of themselves in it.  Again, some performers will buy the cheapest, crummiest costume they can get away with just to get customers' money.  You want quality, and that means better costumes.  Ask them how much they know about leprechauns, Ireland, and the legends.  Ask to hear their Irish accent.<br>  <br>  If you want, send me a message, and I'll try to put you in touch with a lady I know in that area who knows some local performers.|`|QIhBRjW5aa	I think I'd be scared sh*tless if I was visited by a giant leprechaun.<br>  <br>  But try craigslist.org
