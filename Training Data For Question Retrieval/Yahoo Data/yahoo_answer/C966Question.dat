20090202095608AAyt9pX	Sports;Football (American)	Superbowl fair or unfair?	The game was entertaining, but the NFL should be ashamed. The officiating was horrible! and anti climatic to boot. I hope those officials get fined there were just too many bogus calls then missed calls. Arizona got screwed. I'm not a fan of either team, but come on STOP THROWING THE FLAG!!! You'd think the Refs wanted TV time. Good game, could've been great, NFL blows it again.

20090202100552AApXFi7	Sports;Football (Soccer);Men's Premiere Leagues (UK)	Defoe, Cudicini, Pelacios, Chimbonda and now Keane, is that some good dealing or what....?	Im sure most will say chimbonda is a bad idea.. But in 20 mins on sat he set up both of our goals so he is already proving that the lennon/Chimbonda partnership on the right hand side still works!!

20090202100153AAEge7h	Sports;Football (American)	Why do Cardinal fans keep saying the refs blew the game?	In every sport there are questionable calls. Basketball Football, exc..If the Cardinals didn't make key mistakes, they would of easily won the game; like stopping Ben in the last two minutes after they took the lead in the 4th quarter, or not turning the ball over before the second quarter ended. Overall SuperBowl 43 was pretty lame and boring.  I can't wait for Tom Brady to return so everybody can try to knock off the them. That was exciting.

20090202101635AAiQ7WC	Sports;Football (American)	IT'S A SHAM THAT SHANNON SHARPE DIDN'T MAKE IT TO THE HALL HIS FIRST TRY?	I know people are going to try an convince me that he's not a first ballot Hall of Famer.  But he retired as the best tight end in NFL history.  If he played for the 49ers, Cowboys, NY, Pitt or any other big market he would have been a unanimous choice.  It's a travesty and shows how stupid these East coast and West coast writers are.  They are so biased if they don't play in a big market or play for the City they write for they get overlooked.  Plus Sharpe retired when he still had some good years left to take a job with CBS.

There were a couple of others that I thought were not suitable for children, but the Chuck commercial was tied in with the 3D stuff!   I try to keep tabs on the info going into my boys brains (aged 9 and 5) and I'm wondering how others felt about this and will you let your kids watch next year?

I have always wanted to be a cheerleader, but in high school my family did not have a car so I could not stay after school for cheer practices and so I missed out in high school. Now I would like to be a cheerleader in college, but I'm told that its's too late for me. Since I have no experinece and didn't cheer  in high school, no one will allow me on the squad. Is this true? Please help me. I really want this! I can work hard and learn fast. I just want a chance! How can I be a cheerleader? Thank you

Vince Young was down when he pitched the ball and Reggie Bush's dumb azz lateral that could've been called an illegal forward pass...but the last drive of the game was all Vince Young and USC couldn't tackle for shiit. but still..USC just ran outta time cuz neither team could play defense. USC dominated the game completely but they lost it. Do you agree? I'm stating this cuz i feel sorry for ya'll, how did you lose with all that talent on ya team? i mean my Rutgers play with heart even though they ain't have all that bule chip players. ya'll owe me some money cuz i bet on that game.
