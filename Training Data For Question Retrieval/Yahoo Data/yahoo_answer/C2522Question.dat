20090202193215AAZ0gCZ	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	TIE-RODS???  SWAY BAR?	I just had a state inspection done on my '05 dodge dakota 4x4. They failed it due to tie-rod play and both sway bars and bushings/ links needs to be replaced and leaking transmission lines. But i'm suspect cuz the steering feels fine, no tire wear, and there is nothing on the ground from anything leaking. And I only have 50,000 miles on it!  Any advice? Should I get a second opinion? They quoted me about a $1300 job

I've been really negligent at scrapping the snow off of my car (99 Plymouth Neon) hood and a few weeks ago my car wouldn't turn. It made farting/pinging sounds. I tried it again in 15 minutes and it did. Today it made those sounds and shook and the check engine light came on. I took it to Autozone and its code machine said "Cylender misfire detected-Cylinder number 2".   Well, an hour later the check engine light is off. What is up with that?

20090202121109AArlTc5	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	Where can I find a local mechanic to change my brakes?	Sounds a little simple, but not really. I have a Jeep Grand Cherokee (1999) and my back brakes and disks need replacing. I have had quotes from various famous companies ranging from ￡230 - ￡350!   I have found a local company that can supply the disks and brakes for less than ￡70, so I am now looking for someone to fit them for me. It would need to be within 10 miles of WA12(north-west England) because the left rear brake is down to metal(so they have told me) ?   If anyone knows of a good mechanic or reliable garage that don't charge the ridiculous could you let me know please?. Many Thanks

It's been about 1 week and all of a sudden last night when I started the truck and turned the heater on everything started going crazy.  The lights started flashing, windows opening, four way flashing.  Basically shorting out.  The automatic doors and windows and heater are now not functioning at all.  Could this be related to the changing of the heater core even though the job was compleated and the truck driven for a week?  If not, how can I trace the source of the short? What could be happening?  The truck engine seems to be functioning fine.

20090202183229AApokEr	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	My car (95' pontiac sunfire) is leaking transmission fluid.?	I dont know if its just a gasket-seal problem or if it needs a new tranny? I noticed a week ago when I moved my car there was a small amount of dirty red fluid on ground. I checked my transmission fluid it was low via the leak. Then I also noticed when I start my car the engine sounds really rough and when I put in in drive, it shifts hard and pops. Also I dont know if this is related but when I step on the brakes they slip and lose pressure, make a popping noise and then go back to normal.  Is this part of the transmission problem?

20090202191735AAj1N84	Cars & Transportation;Safety	Can mechanics legally prevent me from driving an "unsafe" car?	We've all heard the stories about a mechanic who tells someone that their car is unsafe to drive. When they try to leave for a second opinion, the mechanic says that he cannot let them leave (though sometimes they'll let the person leave if they get the car towed).     I'm looking for any state or federal law which would allow authorize a mechanic to do this. I don't want more stories. I want one of the following:    * Link to a law which authorizes the mechanic to seize/hold cars.    * Link to an "authority" (lawyer, government website, etc) which says one way or the other. Articles discussing these authorities are fine.

This started a few months ago after I had gotten some work done on my car where they had to take apart a good part of the inside of my car.  I am not a mechanic and I don't know much about cars.  Initially I thought the fluid was just empty, so I checked, and it was.  I refilled it, but it still doesn't work, and it's not like the fluid has leaked because it is still there.  I looked the best that I could and it seems that the tube is attached.      Any ideas what could be wrong?  Or is this something I will have to go back to my mechanic for?      Thanks for your help!

Hello everyone, I have a 99 mitsubishi eclipse gs non turbo 2.0 from 5 months ago and has 116,600 miles on it and some good common problems began to emerge, an noisy scream or caused by the serpentine belt and dripping oil, spent 640 dollars to change all the gaskets in the engine, the timing belt and water valve, the licking / drip stop but I realized a few days you still losing oil (which is essential for the car) and concluded that the car was burning oil now, so now the car has two major problems, a burning oil and a mechanic told me that I should change some valvules marrow as the pistons and gaskets or anything to stop (for about $ 30) and second stop burning oil and the other big problem is that just turn the car turns to start this crazy, and at speeds up unless I press the accelerator, a mean upload speed so when the car brakes fans and maybe cause a pulling  this transmission failed, now I have no money to put a new transmission, and would get a liquid called lucas that extends the life of the transmissions, but they told me that until they fix this problem of Do not put any lucas for the ghost acceleration, idk if someone has a mitsubishi and ah had the same problems as me or to the past with different cars, I want a second opinion. if anyone has any idea what that might be what makes the upload speed is a thousand to 1300 1500 2000 without pressing the accelerator and the burning of oil would be helpful.       thanks, this is my first car and although the 5500 and buy it eh got 900 so far and 6100 will be invested and not to resell for the same price but the fact the car I like and I like me a lot and lasts run as before.       any advice, opinion or response is more than welcome.          thanks      //////      hola a todos, tengo un mitsubishi eclipse del 99 gs no turbo 2.0 desde hace como 5 meses, tiene 116600 millas en el y bueno unos cuantos problemas comunes comenzaron a salir, un chirrillo extra;o ocasionado por la serpentine belt, y goteaba aceite, gaste 640 dolares en cambiarle todas las empaquetaduras del motor, la timing belt, y la valvula de agua, el liqueo/goteo paro pero me di cuenta a los pocos dias que seguia perdiendo aceite (cosa esencial para el carro) y llege a la conclusion que el carro estaba quemando aceite ahora, entonces ahora el carro tiene dos grandes problemas, uno que quema aceite y un mecanico me dijo que debia cambiar unas como valvulas osea como empaquetaduras de los pistones o algo asi para pararlo ( por masomenos 30 dolares ) y segun pararia el quemado de aceite, y el otro gran problema es que apenas prendo el carro este arranca revoluciones a lo loco, y cada cierto tiempo se acelera sin que yo presione el acelerador, osea suben las revoluciones por lo tanto cuando freno el carro se avienta y causa un jaloneo que quizas este malogrando la transmision, ahorita no tengo dinero para ponerle una transmision nueva, e iba a ponerle un liquido llamado lucas que alarga la vida de las transmisiones, pero me dijeron que hasta que se arregle ese problema de la aceleracion fantasma no ponga ningun lucas, noc si alguien tiene un mitsubishi y ah tenido los mismos problemas que yo o los a pasado con diferentes carros, quisiera una segunda opinion. si alguien tiene alguna idea de lo que pueda ser eso que hace que las revoluciones se suban de mil a 1300 1500 2000 sin apretar el acelerador y lo del quemado de aceite seria de gran ayuda.       gracias, este es mi primer carro y si bien lo compre por 5500 y le eh metido hasta ahora 900 ya van 6100 invertidos y se que no lo revendere por el mismo precio pero la verdad el carro me gusta y me gustaria que me dure bastante y corra como antes.       cualquier consejo, respuesta u opinion es mas que bienvenido.          gracias

Ok I just bought the car from an auction for 500$ The owners deffinately did not tak care of the vehicle. It was missing vey bad and the oil was horrible looking. It took 2 oil changes in 2 days to get the oil to look normal. Well after changing the oil twice and changing plugs and wires, it does not miss, does have a lifter making a slight noise(no big deal) in fact the car now runs great but..... When I am driving say 60 and want to pass someone and I FLOOR it accelerates the rpms they shoot way up but the cars not grabbing any of that power (as if its in nuetral) Now if I am going 60 and wanna pass someone and press the gas down SLIGHTLY it will grab the pasing gear and go faster more gradually, Only when its FLOORED does it miss. The trany oil has not been changed yet since I have had, but I am hoping its the filter in the trany thats clogged, the trany fluid does not look black nor does it smell burnt, it still has a reddish/light brown color. What are your thaughts? I am hoping and thinking that they neglected to change the engine oil and they probably have neglected the trany as well, I am thinking and hoping its just the filter. Please let me know what you think. Thanks, Josh

20090202203211AAF7oHv	Cars & Transportation;Maintenance & Repairs	High-Mileage Oil vs. Heavier Weight Oil for Old Engine?	I have been using 5W-30 motor oil on my 95 Nissan Quest for 192,000 miles but lately, my low oil pressure light comes on start-up sometimes (>1.5 sec) and I have some lifters noises (non-adjustable) from normal wear. My oil level is normal. I want to try something new for my next oil change.       Which would be best to help the low oil pressure and lifter noise?   1) 10W-40 conventional motor oil   2) High mileage 5W-30 motor oil   3) High Mileage 10W-40 motor oil   4) Different suggestion?      I know heavier weight oil makes my engine work harder but will it do harm to my oil pump? I do not plan for engine rebuilt, oil flush, or new oil pump.       Also, I'm using a WIX oil filter and that when the light start to show up. Can that cause a low oil pressure?

20090202203715AA855Wt	Cars & Transportation;Car Audio	Speaker cabinets - kits - would you buy?	Having a fully equipped wood shop and being an advanced speaker builder I was recently asked to build a pair of enclosures for a member of the group that I moderate. That got me to thinking that it might be a good sideline and I'm wondering what the market might be for quality speaker enclosures. The idea is you supply the drivers and the other components, we just build the "boxes." As there is a substantial automotive market we'd offer both home high - fi and automotive models. Perhaps sound re-enforcement models as well. Just so you know, this is an industrial shop, not a residential garage. I'd price them a little under the enclosures that you can find in catalogs like Partsexpress.

20090202203911AAeb4VC	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Please recommend cars to buy with insurance money?	I was in a car crash recently & have been getting rides and sharing with my family. Now, I need a new-to-me vehicle...      My car was recently called a total by my insurance company's appraisers due to the fact that the work would be around $10,000 - which was around the worth of my baby car, a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe, 4Cyl.      I will soon be getting only $6,000 from them to buy a vehicle.      I'd really appreciate some recommendations on what to buy for up to $8,000, ASAP.   That's what's financially available from my savings with the insurance money and what I'd be able to handle with about a year or two of financing.      Looking for a used, long-lasting, reliable car; preferably, one that I could get a remainder warranty on like Kia & Hyundai provide.   I've been looking at getting a used Kia Spectra5 EX, but it's a bit pricey considering my budget.       I've only got a matter of a few days to get this done, too.   Thank you so much for all help!
