Cuando su gobierno no deja: a sus ahbitantes salir de su territorio, no pueden comprar ropa importada, los que se quieran exiliar van presos, no existe la libertad de expresión ya que los canales on todos estatales, sus ciudadanos no pueden utilizar otra moneda que la cubana pero sus gobernantes bien que le gustan los verdes norteamericanos que tanto critican, ya que los turistas son obligados a pagar en dolares... ES TODO UNA GRAN HIPOCRESIA.<br>  <br>  - La URSS: desde el gobierno de Stalin hasta el de Gorvachov, se vieron gobiernos despóticos que no aceptaban la opinión de sus ciudadanos como en la matanza de los kalska en Ucrania por no querer aceptar el Plan Quinquenal quq queria establecer Iosiv Stalin y la de los Georgianos luego de la Revolución de Octubre. Persiguieron a los Sionistas, la KGB mató a Trostky, la ineficencia del Gobierno se vio en el estallido que se produjo en la Planta de energia nuclear Lenin en Ucrania mejor conocida como el caso de Chernobyl. Entre otras cosas...<br>  <br>  Hoy todo este tipod e cosas se ven infinitamente también en el polemico gobiernod e Hugo Chavez como el de Mahmud Amadineyad, que no permite libertad de expresion y se disfrazan de democrtas para oculatr su dictadura<br>  <br>  que ironia no?|`|719ec66845d6ee29c6ea312e790ba6b3aa	El concepto comunismo, no ha sido bien aplicado por nadie.<br>  Todas las dictaduras, que falsamente se basan en el comunismo, son eso, dictaduras. <br>  El comunismo, precisamente, no creo que incluya la tirania y la sumisión de un pueblo. Tampoco creo que el comunismo y/o socialismo sea una ideología que dice que todo un país debe vivir con restricciones y prohibiciones y con una calidad de vida ínfima, a la que hay que acostumbrarse, mientras los líderes dictadores viven como reyes con comodidaes y lujos propios del capitalismo.<br>  <br>  Muerte a los dictadores.|`|VME1Jki5aa	Estoy de acuerdo contigo en la esencia de lo que planteas, incluso hay que incluir ahí otros derechos más vulnerados, como la propiedad privada.<br>  <br>  Pero realmente no se le puede llamar fascismo.

Democrats made up the bulk of those, with 1.7 million voters. This may have been a manipulation of the legislative process to intentionally influence the outcome of a presidential race. Unless the Republican National Committee and the Democratic National Committees policies are changed, this could happen to you some day. The contents of this website will discuss this bill, what happened; and what you can do to try to reverse this situation and prevent it from recurring. Please help us reinstate the voting rights of Florida Democrats.

yjBPsN90aa	Congress generally declares war, but the Democrats in the 1960s passed the Gulf of Tonkin legislation allowing the President to run a war (Vietnam) without a decleration of war and have not been able to put the genie back in the bottle. Funny thing is LBJ (a democrat) misled the American people about Vietnam along with a democratic congress. <br>  <br>  -In 2005, however, a NSA declassified report[67] revealed that there was no attack on 4 August. It had already been called into question long before this. "The Gulf of Tonkin incident," writes Louise Gerdes, "is an oft-cited example of the way in which Johnson misled the American people to gain support for his foreign policy in Vietnam."[68] George C. Herring argues, however, that McNamara and the Pentagon "did not knowingly lie about the alleged attacks, but they were obviously in a mood to retaliate and they seem to have selected from the evidence available to them those parts that confirmed what they wanted to believe."[69] <br>  -<br>  (sounds somewhat familiar to WMDs, now doesn't it my fellow democrats)<br>  <br>  It's also a direct result of congress having a differing opinion of what FP should be. It's no different then one party claiming the supreme court is rigged and stacked when they don't get the decision they want. It's just political posturing.

R0NdLzynaa	I am not a party voter, I always investigate and vote for individuals that understand the Constitution and follow my values, one in the same.         Those I tend to vote for are usually Republicans.  One of the reasons for this, I do not usually here or see most Republicans using race as a point of distinction or contention.  As Martin Luther King said, "I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation. I have a dream today that all men are created equal. I have a dream that one day little children will live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character. I have a dream We are free at last."         Martin Luther King makes the Republican point perfectly.|`|MLYQh8bMaa	Yes, but republicans don't believe in firsts and i am quite sure that Micheal Steele doesn't either.|`|BLMh0dG6aa	My experience is that the parties is where the real power of the country is, because they have a stranglehold on who gets elected, and unless one is on a local level and have money one has to go to them, and do everything they want or not only won't they get into office, but they'll also not be supported for higher office.    So maybe this is a good sign; perhaps due to Obama; if so then he's already accomplished something no other president ever has.    But there're allot of very conservative African-Americans in the Rep. Party, who are all too wiling to sell out to get high positions.    And not all African-Americans see being African-Americans as their defining factor, just as not all white people, or Texans, or NYC denizens see these factors as their  1 defining factor, so we shouldn't assume he'll do good things for African-Americans just because he's African-American; but we can hope.    Besides I've been saying all along that old rich white men may not understand what its like for African-Americans, so at least he's got that going for him.|`|POriIGJtaa	trendy|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Window dressing.

Get over the race thing, it doesn't matter..|`|9jDBKKw7aa	I supported Steel while he ran gopac and I support him now. A true conservative and some much needed leadership.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	I believe that most Republicans take satisfaction in the tactical advantages of having an African American as Chairman of the RNC... they like what it gives them relative to Obama's Presidency.... some added credibility on the national stage. But you have to look at the percentage of African Americans who are members of the Republican party. That's what tells the real story here.|`|BQdXnCcHaa	Great move! I've also enjoyed seeing Steele on Fox, and he strikes me as intelligent and a true conservative. I noticed one poster described him as moderate. I hope that's not the case. The GOP doesn't need moderate conservatives. We lose elections when we run moderate conservatives. We need true, staunch conservatives who can clearly explain our platform of freedom, rights and responsibility to the American people.

LEBV1FPuaa	In the last 15 years imports have roase 1500% while exports dropped 11000%.The credit debt of Americans has increased along the same lines as there are fewer dollars from GDP going to workers. This meant consumption went up and industry went down. This could be compared to a poor man with baloon loan except it was the retail buisness buying jets and outsourcing customers at the same time.    When you send more then half of your growth to another country it baloons faster then a bad loan. When it fills to much with inflation and credit debt it pops. Then you have no industry, the retailer have a smaller cutomer base, and the banks have more debt then equity.    The only solution that works is to rebuild what every enemy in the world fears American industry and are workers so much better that when even threaten it the crooks around the world scream in fear.     We need to tax non American made goods in stores to make the consumer not want to buy them.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	wee r f**ked!

qPbrv7qHaa	I think most of the relevent issues have been covered by other answers, so i wont repeat them here.    One interesting thought is, if they did legalise it, the government would be pardoning and furthermore, endorsing, the actions of people who up until that point would have been carrying out illegal operations.    Producing, supplying, smuggling... particularly overseas which brings in international law.    Its easy enough to say somethings legal and then start doing it in public, but think of all the criminal types that will crawl out of the woodwork repackaged as businessmen.|`|mkMJYIJOaa	THE ONLY reason pot is illegal is MONEY$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$.    Cops lawyers-judges--and counties-and states make a fortune putting people in prison--fines--and probation fees--this is the best free money--seize cars and homes---the biggest CASH COW cops have ever seen.  Pot was legal until 1956--and it is not illegal because it has any harmful effects..the govt--andf FDA don't care about your health--only revenue.    Alcohol is legal BECAUSE THE MOB runs booze--and has since Prohibition ended in 1933...so no  f--ks with the mobs revenue! right?    There are some states who recognize how harmless pot is..Alaska-Oregon Washington State-all have legal limits--and many other states have decriminalized weed..    Australia you can have 3 ounces legally--and of course, Netherlands--you can't smoke tobacco--in bars--but you can smoke weed..because truth be told--weed has many MORE benefits than adverse effects..    Like I said--it is not about harmful or not--it is all about a money grab by law enforcement. Helll..cops drive around in nice cars they legally steal from folks who get caught with weed while driving..    Cops are way more criminals than pot smokers, agreed?|`|m5FyTeYgaa	The government should regulate only actions that affect another person.    Driving drunk or stoned should be illegal. It is dangerous, and puts others on the road at risk.    Making recreational drug use illegal across the board is rediculous. I drink alcohol, but am not an alcoholic. I've smoked pot, but am not a stoner. The issue is control. The government wants the control, and will not relinquish it to you, even though the Constitution says you have the right to do what you want with your body.    On the other hand, if you drive stoned, and kill a member of my family, you will be locked away FOREVER!|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Let me introduce you to your new BFF, the paragraph.|`|XfhkQwKIaa	The old comparison to alcohol argument is not sound reasoning for legalizing a substance with harmful effects. Yes, alcohol is worse and has destroyed many lives but that is a separate issue. We could do without either one of them as far as I am concerned.|`|6ee3feb6285fbcb7ae64e5552099eccaaa	you make many valid points which i will not dispute. however, i had to read your question a number of times to try and understand what you are trying to say. i hope you were smoking marijuana when you wrote it because that would then explain the incoherency of your statements. if you weren't smoking marijuana then i have nothing but pity for you because you have already destroyed too many brain cells.|`|l1ynPOiSaa	The Govt. could not be able to fully tax some thing that can be grown on a window sill.Its all about the ...$$$$...|`|wmXLpI25aa	I mostly agree with you that marijuana is way more benign than alcohol, but I still don't think you should driving while you're high. You ARE impaired in some sense, and it's safest for you and everyone else on the road to NOT drive while you're high.    But overall, alcohol is worse here- it causes people to become severely impaired, and usually brings out aggression and rage in some people, leading to abuse, beatings, fights, accidents, etc. Add to that the risk of alcohol poisoning... It's just bad news.    Marijuana isn't totally harmless, as it does kill brain cells, as alcohol does, and inhaling smoke into your lungs is never good, but overall, I believe it's less harmful if enjoyed moderately and NOT IN A CAR.    Marijuana is illegal because it is associated with serious drugs like heroine and cocaine, so it's hard to get people to look past that, even though pot is not nearly on the same level as hardcore drugs. Alcohol has long been a social substance and the government can tax the crap out of it, so it works out well for them. I think it's just a matter of getting people to not see pot as a serious drug ( because it's NOT a serious drug), and then maybe it could be legalized, but it would be taxed like none other.|`|ajPRVnFVaa	You have a very valid point.  If reefer became a social drug such as alcohol it would become legal.  I would be the first in line to open up a hooch house.

Most illegals are already paying taxes.  However, he may realize, like Bush did, that it would be much too expensive to have law enforcement track down every last illegal and deport them.  A better solution would be to tempt the illegals to come forward voluntarily by offering them an easier path to citizenship.  Yes, we'll be bending our laws for the benefit of those that have already broke them, but it won't be the same as the amnesty Reagan passed out in the 1980's.

bda08b314a4966c36d4acd161c9ec0f6aa	I loved that movie and have seen it several times. I think it is because the president is the leader of the free world and he has other people to take the bullet for him.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	It's a movie...|`|UvzKiis0aa	It's a movie.  In the movie, Glenn Close is the VP and she doesn't want to take over as POTUS.  It's obvious that she is not comfortable with the power she has to wield or the responsibility.  Thus, she is rather perturbed at the risks the President (Harrison Ford) takes to get control of Air Force One back from the Russian terrorists.  In the story line, this attack is blowback revenge from the USA meddling in Afghanistan, arming the mujaheddin against the Soviets.  Damn, that seems to haunt us quite a bit.  Thanks, Reagan!    I guess you could compare it to Bush jumping on Air Force One on 9/11/01 and hiding out all day, flying from military base to military base, in order to protect him from attack.  The Secret Service should have hustled Bush out of the classroom as soon as Andy Card told him about the second plane.  Although I don't see why he needed to run and hide when we were attacked by COMMERCIAL JETS BY GUYS WITH BOXCUTTERS.  How this managed to bring down our trillion dollar defense system is beyond me.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	One of my favorite movies.  VP Close is right.  The president has a responsibility to the country.  Even if something were to happen to the president and the VP were to take over, there is no guarantee that the VP would be up to speed on everything the president was involved in.  Most likely he (or she) would not be.  A famous example was Harry Truman's not finding out about the atomic bomb until after FDR died and he, Truman, became president.    The sudden death of the president can have financial and national security implications.  It can cause the market to react negatively or encourage our enemies to take advantage of a perceived power vacuum.  If a president wants to live his life on the edge by participating in dangerous activities then he should have thought of that before taking the job.    "Get off my plane!!"|`|5B5pirFWaa	Because he is the President, Chief of State. When you take on a position like that it is assumed your personal intrest take a back seat to your duties as the holder of the Office you are in. The postion, power, and stature of the Office is bigger than any individual. Good example my former Gov. Blagojevich!|`|6OLiuM9Gaa	I didn't see the movie.    For most Presidents, that may be true. Most Presidents in the last few decades have never served in combat. Some have never served their country in the military. They are not equipped to make a tactical decision, even though they may have the authority to do so. These must rely totally on the advice of military experts (most like that excludes their Cabinet also). In the absence of such advice, they cannot make a sound decision based on combat experience. Anything they do is a WAG.    If she meant that the President was betting his life on a decision without basis of experience, then she could be right. If he had experience, then she was out of line. If a person is on the scene, he's in a better position to analyze the situation than somebody sitting an in armchair in front of a TV. If that person also has combat experience -- experience dealing with danger, he's likely to be able to make a better tactical decision than one who hasn't the experience.
MPpO4xQMaa	actually it's not that simple Israel knows very well that giving the Golan Heights to Syria without any guarantees is just a suicide , at 1999 Syria and Israel were very close to achieve a peace pact but they disagreed on few meters which blow up all the negotiations   Israel told Syria many times that if Syria wants the Golan Heights then it has to be unarmed area with an international supervision   besides Obama showed a big support to Israel defending their right to exist and live in peace, he also rejected to negotiate with Hamas even though Hamas is elected by Palestinians saying they have to admit the right of Israel to exist before talking to them   I think the Isreali-Syrian peace is un reachable at the moment specially with the Palestinians refugees problem and Hamas offices at Syria|`|2cIKIbYmaa	Prophecy is not my forte, but I do know that Israel is willing to give back the Golan Heights, and in fact negotiated with Syria when the Bush Admin opposed it.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	PM Bibi Netanyahu will give the word and the IDF will level it.

I am sorry that Fox news, the highest rated news organization in this country, is always put in a bad light by liberal haters. They are mostly fair in their analysis. Try getting some balance in your news, once in a while don't by all the nonsense every other media source puts out listen to some different view. You know  get out of your cave "saddam".  I am not sure how this will all play out, it has been tried before with little result, but lets hope it does not take another world war to get us out of this rut. Especially with the soft liberal media that absolutely does not want to stand up to any country that threatens us. I wonder what spin they will put on that if we were forced into that situation. Give our president a shot,you do have at least 4 years to attack him. I would like to say i feel like I watched a country get sham wowed but I also want to give Mr. Obama a fair shake.    Oh Gary, up the democrats have controlled the spending the last 8 years,did you forget who controlled the house and senate. Besides that it is not only rep.or dem. that take your money,it is equal opportunity. Remember every polotician out there has certain special interest groups in their pockets. If you think they are taking your money now,what are going to think when you have to work for a living and give your paycheck to your neighbor who does not work to support his family. I don't know about you but I work to take care of my family and so does my wife, we do not work because i want to take care of people who do not have enough pride to get up and work for a living.

3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	The benefits in both branches are the same. Retirement, health insurance, barracks, etc. No branch gets treated differently as far as benefits go. With the navy you will travel more and be able to see more places. I have a friend in the Air Force and she has only been to Korea. Where she is stationed. I have been in the Navy for the same amount of time as she's been in the Air Force and I have visited about 15 countries. The Navy is also technology oriented because when we are out to sea we need the best because we do not have the luxury of just getting replacements. We also have the best training. Again, when we are out to sea we don't have the luxury of just calling the service rep to our station.    But you should look at the Air Force and the Navy and decide for yourself which one is going to be best for you.|`|378161a161ce8b1460b92ef6619f0c5baa	Are you an idiot?    Benefits are the same.     Pay, retirement, health care etc all come from the same place and are the same for each service.|`|ymNM6mmzaa	The benefits are pretty much the same in all four branches.    Depending on your test scores, the Navy may be able to give you more of a choice on your job.  Also, the Navy tends to promote faster than the Air Force.    If you want to "actually serve and fight," the Army may actually be a better choice for you, or at least worth investigating.  If you sign your contract right at the beginning of your senior year, you will get at least a $10,000 Enlistment Bonus, plus you get to pick your job.    As far as jobs that "actually serve and fight" in the Air Force and Navy, you should look at Master at Arms (Navy) and Security Forces (Air Force).    I would say, if your choice is strictly between Air Force and Navy, your real question is "Do you want to be on a ship?"      Good Luck|`|IOU6zo9Raa	My husband is in the Navy and we are at an army base with mostly airforce here. He is friends with mostly all airforce guys and he tell me very often that he is thankful that he joined the navy- seeing all the bullshit the airforce has to deal with. It does depend on the command, but in general it seems like the Airforce is stricter and harder on it's airmen. They have to follow a lot of the same rules living off post as the guys on post. Airforce puts emphasis on education the same as the navy, but they don't offer as good sign on bonuses and re enlistment bonuses. I would think basic training is similar, it's about the same amt. of time and all. Airforce PT's 3 times a week here as the Navy only has to once. My husband considered both at one time and found that he had more options job wise in the Navy. The job he chose when he first enlisted was never even mentioned in the Airforce recruiter's office. He has told me however that if he was to get comissioned (which your obviously not) he would go Airforce. Apparantly there are more options for an Airforce officer. Navy also seems to promote faster.|`|465585eaeb565271820ea6eaa2a5e0e3aa	1st my background.  I served 30 years in the AF and AFR. I have been around the world twice served in VN and Iraq.I was stationed on a naval air station which had all branches accept the coast guard, having said that;  All branches have things in common and peculiarities unique to them.  You need to determine what type of career you want to pursue first.  Then see what branch most fits that choice.  No matter which branch you choose you will sign a contract, make sure whatever you sign guarantees your career choice and if has civilian application if you do not stay in the military.  Advancement in rank in the AF & Navy is slower than Army because of higher retention and remember the Marine Corps is a branch of the Navy not a stand alone service.  As far as  "fighting ' is concerned I was a forward air controller and many, many AF and Navy jobs may put you in harms way and many, many Army and marine jobs wont.  Maybe you should consider the Peace Corps as a choice  GOOD LUCK|`|AA10025824	The one that will give you the job you want to do.   The Navy would put you in harms way more often during a war, but all the military is subject to that.|`|IUXriZQJaa	It depends on your priorities.  If all you care about are benefits, stay the heck out of our military and leave space open for someone who cares.  If you want to do something worthwhile, go for it. You don't have to be in JROTC to do well in the military, but it will help. It will also help if you take some online classes and get some college credits. Those count toward better enlistment status.      Air Force will give you a much better living standard and better benefits.  Navy offers you far more opportunities.  My dad served as a fighter pilot for the Air Force when they were first operationally flying the super-jets. I have lived around and/or on Army, Navy, Marine Corps and Air Force bases all my life.  You have a lot of options in the military that civilians just don't have.  When you get in, regardless of what branch, take all the training they will give you, and take college classes whenever you have time.  And try to travel when you have the opportunity. It could be your only chance to see the world before you settle down.   On the other hand, if you are a good fit for the military, you could find it to be a nice career.   To me, every soldier is a hero.  Wear our flag well.|`|ygimTNzoaa	Yes, long term Air Force offeres MUCH better benifites and retirement. My fiances friend got out of high school and went in the air force retired at 38 years old. I dont hear much about the navy though I'm sure they offer good things. Airforce is just a little better though in my oppinion.|`|89eacaf706726be6ca9f259d599c0f27aa	dont join based on benefits because they only "really" differ based on enlistment and retiring bouses but the benefits are pretty much the same while in service for any branch.    Join based on the job you want and what atmosphere/work environment you want    Edit: ALL services SERVE&FIGHT my cousin was getting shot at constantly while in Kazachstan and Kyrgicstan as a security forces airman in the air force    The navy also spends a lot of time protecting off shore oil rigs in the persian gulf and one of sea cadet instructors got a bronze star in afghanistan(and he wasn't a seal)|`|0D4q4Q2Raa	Both of my brothers (neither of which were in the USAF, they were marines) tell me that the Air Force has not only better benefits, but also a more overall lax outlook on things. I can't truly tell you from experience which is better, but I trust both of them and am going to join the Air Force myself.|`|AA12291184	don't do it!!!!!      you will be sent to war, you will meet the most evil people who will want to kill you.|`|8C9yJ0Bwaa	Talk to both the Air Force and the Navy.  Check them out for a few weeks and ask as many questions as possible  If you have friends who are in either branches, ask them too what its like.    Then decide.  You have a lot of time on your hands, don't worry about getting into it too fast.     The Air Force Recruiter may tell you not to talk to the Navy, don't listen to him, he wants to say that so you will join USAF. Its best to scope out everything first.    Good luck!

So I'd say they're doing that old trick of failed politicians, trying to blame the US for problems that were of their own making. And, of course, they ignore the degree to which the US and American policies have fueled economic growth.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	USA is epicenter of the world crisis.|`|R5u7IEUoaa	Who cares what they think...and anyway, it's not like they are pure, sweet, and innocent.  Always easier to blame the other guy than to take on the responsibility.  That's the liberal way.|`|BImIMnbzaa	It's probably both !  Bankers, Wall Street, Congress, the White House.  These are just a few of the culprits responsible for the economy as it is.  It truly has been mishandled and why people like the former two chairmen of the federal reserve didn't speak up, makes it a total mystery.    The US can take a big portion of the blame for the worlds economy faltering as well.  The domino effect was more than just a supposition, it was real.  It started in the US, and before long became a world wide disaster.  Since the economic demise stated as early as 1982, I believe that perhaps two things contributed to its start.    Detente with China was the catalyst that opened the door to cheap manufacturing.  It was in 1974 when Henry Kissinger, under the authority of Richard Nixon, broke the isolationalist barrier between China and the rest of the world.  By 1982 China had already penetrated the the US manufacturing enough to start seeing changes in the GNP.  It was Ronald Reagan, a short time later who announced that we were no longer in the industrial revolution, and were becoming an information gathering society.  At the time, I don't believe many of us truly appreciated what was being said, or what impact it would have on our lives.    The debacle that was to become the Jimmie Carter administration had tremendous impact on the US economy.  To what degree it could have had lasting effects, will be left to the ages.  Historians will determine this, and Jimmie's legacy lies in the balance.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Yes, I think they're right but they should also recognize that we have taken political steps to correct the situation and are taking steps to try to address the adverse economic effects.

Because of a terrible drought all the Jews went to Egypt for food and shelter and later were made slaves by the Egyptians. Moses led them back to the land of Israel.

Then in 70 AD the Roman Emperor Tiberius destroyed Jerusalem and captured the Jews and totally took over the country. On May 15 1948 the Jews recaptured the land and re-formed their country inviting as many Jews as wanted to come back to the Country of the ancestor's birth.

READ IT AND DECIDE FOR YOURSELF , THIS IS THE TRUTH ( It takes just 1.5 minutes to read!!!! ) It makes sense and it's not slanted. Jew and non-Jew -- it doesn't matter.    > 1. Nationhood and Jerusalem. Israel became a nation in 1312 BCE, Two> thousand years before the rise of Islam.    > 2. Arab refugees in Israel began identifying themselves as part of a   Palestinian people in 1967, two decades after the establishment of the modern State of Israel.  > 3. Since the Jewish conquest in 1272 BCE, the Jews have had dominion over the land for one thousand years with a continuous presence in the land for the past 3,300 years.  > 4. The only Arab dominion since the conquest in 635 CE lasted no more than 22 years.  > 5. For over 3,300 years, Jerusalem has been the Jewish capital   Jerusalem has never been the capital of any Arab or Muslim entity.   Even when the Jordanians occupied Jerusalem, they never sought to make it their capital, and Arab leaders did not come to visit.  > 6. Jerusalem is mentioned over 700 times in Tanach, the Jewish Holy   Scriptures. Jerusalem is not mentioned once in the Koran.  > 7. King David founded the city of Jerusalem. Mohammed never came to  Jerusalem.  > 8. Jews pray facing Jerusalem. Muslims pray with their backs toward  Jerusalem.  > 9. Arab and Jewish Refugees: in 1948 the Arab refugees were encouraged to leave Israel by Arab leaders promising to purge the land of Jews. Sixty-eight percent left without ever seeing an Israeli soldier.  > 10 The Jewish refugees were forced to flee from Arab lands due to Arab brutality, persecution and pogroms.  > 11. The number of Arab refugees who left Israel in 1948 is estimated   to be around 630,000.     The number of Jewish refugees from Arab   lands is estimated to be the same.  > 12. Arab refugees were INTENTIONALLY not absorbed or integrated into the Arab la nds to which they fled, despite the vast Arab territory.   Out of the 100,000,000 refugees since World War II, theirs is the only   refugee group in the world that has never been absorbed or integrated   into their own people's lands. Jewish refugees were completely   absorbed into Israel, a country no larger than the state of New Jersey  > 13. The Arab-Israeli Conflict: the Arabs are represented by eight separate nations, not including the Palestinians. There is only one   Jewish nation. The Arab nations initiated all five wars and lost. Israel defended itself each time and won.  > 14. The PLO's Charter still calls for the destruction of the State of   Israel. Israel has given the Palestinians most of the West Bank land,   autonomy under the Palestinian Authority, and has supplied them.  > 15. Under Jordanian rule, Jewish holy sites were desecrated and the   Jews were denied access to places of worship. Under Israeli rule, all   Muslim and Christian sites have been preserved and made accessible to people of all faiths.  > 16. The UN Record on Israel and the Arabs: of the 175 Security Council resolutions passed before 1990, 97 were directed against Israel.  > 17. Of the 690 General Assembly resolutions voted on before 1990, 429 were directed againstIsrael.  > 18. The UN was silent while 58 Jerusalem Synagogues were destroyed by the Jordanians.  > 19. The UN was silent while the Jordanians systematically desecrated the ancient Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives.  > 20. The UN was silent while the Jordanians enforced an apartheid-like a policy of preventing Jews from visiting the Temple Mount and the   Western Wall.|`|m5qw9g17aa	Yes, only 5000 years.

He only wanted to recount 3 heavily democrat counties (Broward, Dade, and Palm Beach) which would maximize his chances.  That was why Bush took the case to the Supreme Court in the first place.

Afj4KTFMaa	I understand what you are feeling... It's difficult for both parties invovled in military relationships... especially when one is a civilian that has never been in the military.     Things to remember if he has to go away is keep up communications and don't be afraid to express your feelings of loneliness to friends. They can be your greatest support. As far as communications go, letters are great to send a little touch of home. You can scent the paper with your usual perfume/body spritz... If he deploys to places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, then he will usually have access to MWR's... which of course have free internet and most are equipped with all the Messengers... Webcam is another great way to communicate because you can see eachother. Which helps with the lonely days. Keep a set of his dog-tags on a teddy bear that you can hold at night... Little cheesy I know, but it helps...     He is going to be stressed whether he stays in the states or goes overseas just due to the normal stresses of the military... Be his support and always try to remember that he joined for a reason and the military can be a wonderful life for people.

GFOdY3nBaa	yes, she should get evidence that she is abused by him.  i would say at the least he is abusing her emotionally, and threatening to take the baby. she should go to the shelter (she needs to keep her marriage certificate, baby's birth certificate, all the papers of hers).   then she needs to make file for sole custody, and make an appointment with immigration.   they wont deport her, she needs to get her prove of abuse, and talk to the officer. it is really not likely she will be allowed to get a GC, but she might keep the baby.   she can always say he made her stay here, and have a baby, and now blackmailing and extorting her. this is a police matter, and if there is any physical abuse, than he will get in trouble. there were cases when people were getting their papers because they ve been abused. but it takes a lot to prove it first.|`|cdpBdzZtaa	Try to find local non profit organization for Battered Immigrant women,they might help your niece's friend.

di43MlSFaa	It was in the news this morning that Senator Gregg (R) of N.H. I believe, has been chosen to be Secretary of Commerce, that he was the second choice behind Bill Richardson. His fellow Republicans are 'warning' him about accepting the position.  I am extremely baffled by everything taking place now. If qualified, good people are chosen for positions what difference should it make if they are Republican or Democrat.  Way, way, way back in the day there weren't the two parties, it was completely bi-partisan before the two parties formed.   We elected these people to represent all of us, not this side or that side. It's truly sad that our country is so incredibly divided and those in Washington have to force issues instead of finding a common ground to represent all the people in some way. They won't please everyone all of the time, but making the attempt would be refreshing.  I know what President Obama has spoken to about his desire on working with all of those in Washington and am pleased by that. Whether or not the rest will work together with him and his administration seems to be in their court. Both sides create these difficulties to varying degrees from all I can see.   Truly though, it seems that the "United we stand, divided we fall" concept has been completely forgotten and gone by the wayside.     Edit:  The Republican Governor's are now pushing their counterparts in Washington to pass the stimulus package. With all States badly needing programs/funds to help their States stay afloat, the GOP Governor's would very much like to see the stimulus get passed.  http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090131/ap_o...

After the election the reality of Washington politics returns and it's business as usual.    President Obama has tried to make nice with the GOP, visiting them on the Hill, saying that he cares about their votes and so on.  But the first vote in the house on the stimulus package attracted not a single Republican "Aye".    The Democrats, after their huge victory in November and with a President with almost unprecedented approval ratings, hold the winning hand and will quickly tire of making endless concessions in the name of bi-partisanship.  A double whammy for them as the GOP, left out in the cold and whining and scratching at the door, will look increasingly irrelevant.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	The GOP knows that all these earmarks have been on hold till they got the full majority.

XLXncQu9aa	Well, I must first say Rush Limbaugh is an idiot.  He has no idea what he is talking about as it concerns the legitimate issues.  All he gets paid to do is sit on his behind all day long, and rant and rave about nothing that can be conducive to our society as it relates to our issues.  He's the guy that said he wants Obama to fail as president if he doesn't stick to his "conservative values".  Who cares about whether Obama sticks to conservatism or not, as long as these issues get resolved.  Back to your question, leaving the economy the way it is will do more damage.  The reason why is because if we leave our economy in a recession, we are basically doing nothing to grow more jobs.  The problem over the last few years has been the loss of jobs, and the increase in corruption in government authority.  If we can grow more jobs, and start making officials responsible for their actions then we can see a better economy.  But jobs must be created by going green, and not depending on foreign oil, and other properties.  Until we grow jobs, and get the value of money going again, it won't change.  A recession left alone would be deadly, and we are talking about a worse economic crash than that of the 1934-35 era.|`|DYNaQ6Yzaa	Yes, anyone who has studied economics understands that - government interference will only worsen and prolong it - like FDR'S     the revisionist's theory about the new deal taking us out of the depression is false - the wars took us out of the depression - there are some excellent resources for the real story avialable:    "Treasury Secretary, Henry Morgenthau, angry at the Keynesian spenders, confided to his diary May 1939: "We have tried spending money. We are spending more than we have ever spent before and it does not work. And I have just one interest, and now if I am wrong somebody else can have my job. I want to see this country prosper. I want to see people get a job. I want to see people get enough to eat. We have never made good on our promises. I say after eight years of this administration, we have just as much unemployment as when we started, except now we have enormous debt to boot.""|`|lMKy9Ho8aa	If anyone truly believes anything that Limbaugh says, then they are just as SICK as he is!!|`|BLMh0dG6aa	That's like saying well treat that town that's being bombed like an ecosystem, they'll be enough people left to rebuild the culture and populace, so we won't go top aid them.|`|AA11828439	Herbert Hoover thought so.

Have we ever actually left a recession alone and not interfered with it?|`|otYOxmnuaa	Yes -- basic high school economics tells us of a natural economic business cycle that we're all subject to:    Peak - Contraction - Trough - Expansion - Peak - Contraction - Trough - Expansion - Peak    We're in a contractionary period and/or in the trough.  The next stage is for the market to find it's equilibrium (where supply of products/services meets demand of the consumers) and correct itself -- pushing us into growth (expansion).    The question is how long and how deep is the trough?    The funny thing about this stimulus bill is that many world renown economists came out recently (2008) and said we probably do more harm than good if we meddle in economic affairs -- that is try to correct markets when they're going through a natural correction.    Who was one of these economists?    Alan Greenspan.  He publicly said everything he thought to be true about manipulating market particulars in order to control peaks/troughs is wrong.    And here were are again -- injecting money into a market to artificially raise the trough.      Short run advantages often have long term implications.  It'd be nice for someone within the office to take a stand and say "lets think this over".  ======================================...  For the people who gave thumbs down -- this is the reason we're going to be strapped with another 1.3 trillion dollar debt.  It's ignorance...nothing more. If you have no idea, you don't belong in the discussion.  ======================================...  What do we do?  This would be my approach -- get government out of the way and give people their money.    Cut all taxes    We already have infrastructure to create jobs at current businesses...give them an opportunity to do so.    1. Cap. Gains (Get people investing)  2. Consumer (Increase purchasing power -- encourage people to be on the street looking for the bargains)  3. Income (Across the board chop)  4. Corporate Tax (a big chop -- we have one of they highest corp. taxes in the world -- it's stifling business)  5. Eliminate useless fees and or bureaucratic kinks and help businesses operate fluidly      I'd also cut government spending and cleanup some of the excess in government programs.    And with the added revenue generated by lower taxes (which is an indisputable fact), they can start infrastructure projects if they choose to. You know -- earn the money first before you spend it.    As for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- you have to scale them down as they're using valuable resources we could use domestically.    I wouldn't supply abortion funding to Africa at this point. And I would look to cutting back some of the foreign aid we offer around the world -- use that money here at home.    I'd look to campaign in favor of nuclear power and get some plants built.    I'd regulate the health care industry -- make a deal with them that if they pull premiums out of the sky, we'll mandate ALL citizens must own a policy and make sure it's criminally charged if they don't -- just like we did with car insurance.    I'd offer cash prizes (incentives) to free-market enterprises who can introduce:  1. A viable alternative to combustion engines that reduces overall output of pollution and/or waste.  2. A viable oversight plan to watch over free-market activity in exchange of excessive regulations which stifle growth    There are a ton of projects we could pursue.    ======================================...    And for those who think taxing the rich is a great idea -- you're wrong. They provide YOU with jobs and they can only do that if their costs are minimized. Basic economics.    And Clinton's policies actually reduced tax revenue. Bush's policy of cutting tax increased revenue and brought in more money than Clinton ever came close to doing.    When you tax people -- you levy an added cost to them and their businesses.|`|MVY8xhXlaa	I've explained this in great detail too many times- seems like it's an endless question by democrats.    Here's an analogy to help you - it's like a person having a depression and the doctor loading them up with prozac instead of helping them deal with the underlying problem.  Prozac (government help) is a temporary bandaid but not a solution.  Rush is absolutely correct.      This explains why so many democrats are premanently on prozac- same mentality.|`|13db40225fc025aff3b81b2609fc6918aa	Because what Music man has said is correct.Please feel free to do some research,not just listen to the mainstream media (including Rush). Government intervention will just make the problem worse.Where do you think we can get the money (over a trillion dollars) without causing the value of the dollar to fall?  I know it is hard to believe,but government is not the answer to everything.If you put a limit on things , people will react.Unemployment for example, limit it and people will learn to look while they can,not just work to get an extension. People need to be forced to change or they will continue to make the same mistakes.|`|N5jBMjrDaa	I highly doubt that Rush Limbaugh after flunking out of Southeast Missouri State University after two semesters is qualified to give advice on how to handle a recession.|`|84871326f6678fb2f9c40486796e4ebbaa	The short answer is 'yes'.  Left alone every depression, recession, bubble and panic will eventually 'come to an end'.  Every downturn will eventually hit its lowest level of equilibrium and gradually the overall economy will recover.  The problem lays with damage done in the interim to a first world, formerly industrialized country of 350 million people who rely on modern services such as electricity, clean water, trash removal, transportation, education, food delivery, medical services, on-call police and fire, functioning courts, affordable shelter and a host of other services that only a modern society can provide.  All of the above points rely on people working for wages, either to purchase their needs directly, or have them provided via the taxes they pay.  No wages mean no income.  No money means no taxes to support first world services.  A long enough depression without intervention means an end to a government that does nothing and the institution of a government that does something.  This is how we got Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Ho Chi Min, Tojo, Pol Pot, Saddam Hussein,  that jerk in Iran, and all the rest of those bozos that have a 'quick fix'.   Give it a think.  Obama is doing not only the right thing, but the only thing.

I speak Iraqi dialect Arabic, but I am in the military police corps. My language skills paid off during my training of Iraqi Army and Iraqi Police. It was better to use my skills rather than instill trust in a translator who you knew nothing about.      Going to the ROK would be easily obtainable since they are always needing Soldiers for that area. Ask your recruiter what would be best for you.

But he will, rest assured.|`|FmEsMOKVaa	Well...I'm glad you voted for issues rather then race.    The way i look at it....Obama mat be inexperienced but if he is open-minded...listens to various experienced people....checks his facts over again...then he can make sound decisions.    But if he is arrogant..close minded like Bush..then he will make many dumb decisions.     But let's hope he gets his facts and really put effort into his descions by checking up on facts.     Most poeple reagardless of race have a tendency to make quick decisons without researching. Let's hope Obama is one of the few open-minded people that takes the time to look into things.|`|n5wvy5FYaa	As expected, he's true to himself alone.

Hopefully Obama does CARE which would be a refreshing change.  Obama is 1/2 black and 1/2 white --  I don't see him as a black man.  I see him as a man who comes from both sides and I'm waiting for him to show me the change.  At least he says he's in it for us and I don't see the arrogant attitude of a **** of a president we had to endure for 8 years!  So far Obama is saying all the right things... like it's so carefully orchestrated which to me is politics.  But hopefully there's a deeper commitment and I admire him for listening to others and looking to all sides to find solutions.  If he isn't acting in a vaccuum we have a better chance to get some good change going on.|`|5yuZwOLQaa	His spending is already out of control.  We do not know what happened to the last stimulus money and he is putting more out there.  The bill is loaded with spending programs that have nothing to do with stimulating anything.

He is surrounding himself with former criminals and tax cheaters.|`|u2HV0MaHaa	Sorry but I think I need to speak to some of these assertions;    ?

Ordered the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay.   ....and they are going where?    ? Ordered a pay freeze of his top staff.  ....nice move looks impressive but does little     ? Ordered stricter controls on lobbyists in government.  ....right before Geithner anounced his right hand man is a lobbyist    ? Ordered compliance with the Freedom of Information Act.   ......Does this mean he will finally release his records from Law School?  ?

Met with GOP leaders of both Houses of Congress to improve the stimulus package.  ......that seems to of worked. The GOP is voting against his stimulas plan along with 11 Dems    ? Did an interview with Al Arabiya TV, improving our reputation in the Arab/Muslim world.  .....says who?    ? Talked to every leader in the Middle East.   .....so I can assume the wars are over?    ?

lMKy9Ho8aa	though they did not come out victorious, Hilary and Palin paved the way for women to be acknowledged in high levels of government offices. It was the first time in US History to have a woman be a presidential candidate (Hilary) and for one to be on the vice-presidential ticket (palin).  The 2008 election set-up precedence for what our country has never seen before; women and minorities running for highest levels of office.

AA12191521	In a multi party parliamentary government you have much bigger chance of the government failing. This is what just happened in Iceland. A bunch of small parties banded together to beat one large party. But then the smaller party coalition started fighting among themselves and could not put a government together. Pretty soon everyone quit and left the country in anarchy. At least with a 2 party system it is easy to know who the majority is and you don't have as much infighting. A 2 party system ensures continuity of government. You may not always like them but they will always be there.|`|m5J36D28aa	I've always been open to more parties but they can't seem to get their act together.  Lots of money being wasted on half-*** attempts to get votes.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	It's OK.  It ensures their will always be a majority.  That's not always a good thing, but it allows the government to move quicker and with more authority than multiparty systems.  Once you introduce a third party, if a measure requires a majority to pass it, you easily run into scenarios where majorities cannot be achieved, and the next step is to compromise, most multi-party system compromises are so watered down and ineffective that it makes the governments less effective.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	No, I don't like the two-party system either. You're not alone. And hey, I agree with everything you said up there.     Ever heard of Ron Paul? He's probably the only politician who's thinking of now and of 50 years from now. He's against the Iraq war and foreign intervention, and he's probably the furthest from Marxism there is.|`|v0PY0UDAaa	We should have no parties and people should run as individuals.  Parties encourage insider politics and corruption.  The only people who get to run are people that can navigate the shark infested waters of their own party.  They also have to appeal to the radial fringe of that party in order to get ahead nationally.  Political parties don't encourage politicians that serve the best interest of their constituency, but instead encourage politicians that contribute best to the party.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I like the two party system over alternatives like a one-party system (for obvious reasons) or more parties because in that scenario no party gains enough backing to accomplish anything and if it does get enough power, the dissent is too fractionalized to provide a proper check and balance to that power.    I think that if you look at the history of the US which has had a two party system for most of its existence you find that although there are ups and downs, the system has provided the opportunity for us to be where we are now, the world's lone superpower and the biggest economy on earth.  We may have a weak economy, but we will recover from that and there is sufficient debate and backing to implement effective help for the economy.|`|tdG5409Uaa	I think we all in this world should come to a larger area with billions of acre and drink, smoke, chat , and settle out our difference. But before we start let's give a moment of prayer to the BIG DOG|`|3nO2lfkcaa	I'm not sure, but a two party system based on fundraising is definitely hurting any chance for "real" democracy.    My beef is that one side is conservative, and the other conservative-light. I'd like to see some actual progressives and true leftists have a louder say in things. But in a duopoly, these voices are shouted out of the mainstream, and we end up with a center-right ruling faction.|`|tu2VbI0zaa	The problem, is that you see war as needing to be avoided, and wrong..    And sadly, war is the only way sometimes to fight for our freedom, our survival and our rights....    Do you think evil people will just ask nicely for whatever they want?    No...they'll just kill us all, unless we stop em...    And I've been in both parties...and while I stand by the values of the Republican Party, this endless in-fighting in america, isn't very healthy or wise....|`|09neUq82aa	Firstly I'd suggest you try to understand one or two things about Marxism. Not a Marxist, just annoyed by ignorance.    Anyway, I don't like the two-party system. Rather than truly represent the people, a two party system just keeps things moderate. The two parties are generally on opposite sides of the political spectrum, but they both move towards the centre to scrape up more votes. Beyond a few policies, there aren't many major ideological differences between the Democrats and Republicans.    The end result is that people all vote for one of the two parties closest to their principles (and they are almost always a long way off), not an independent party that represents their view fully. This leads to the Government being an improper representation of the people.    Still though, a moderate one is a very privileged political position to be in. True democracy seems utopian to me. After all, if the Government was a completely proportional representation of all peoples' true political views, there'd be nothing but arguing and shaky coalition Governments!
bQLQdRBZaa	The Keynesian economists--and most others--were warning this would happen. No one wanted to listen. When we spoke out, we got ridiculed.    So now the right wing whats to know?    Short answer: they are getting exactly what they deserve. And cleaning up the mess they made because hey refused to listen and exercise any responsibility or restraint is going to be very, very expensive.    They can forget whining for sympathy. They  deserve none and they will get none.    Just on a personal note--even up to a year ago, I got called "unpatriotic" and " commie" for daring to point out what was happening. Don't expert me to do anything but laugh when some neoconservative loses his home, his business, his job.  BTW: I'm making more money than I ever did in my life--because I thought for myself and took steps to protect myself from the "conservatives" irresponsible policies.  LOL|`|zjpB2GARaa	The Keynesians were discredited due to the disaster they caused in the 1970s.  While the Austrian School economists were predicting everything that has come to pass in the last 2 years or so, the Chicago and Supply Side (and other establishment Republican economists) were saying that all is well and the Keynesians were sitting around whining about CEO pay and gas prices.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	What do you mean?  There were plenty of Keynesians around before the crisis...but the Republican Congress for the first several years under Bush, and Bush's Treasury secretary were NOT Keynesian...understand now?    The stimulus will help the small person faster because it creates jobs through government spending.  Just cutting taxes like the Republicans want will not be a fast solution, and certainly will not help those who have already lost their jobs as they are no longer paying income taxes!|`|21d1f12aab8b2f3771bee2912c3e2dfdaa	Keynesians with all their theories is a pure joke, especially in now days.

The austrian school is the only school worth paying attention to which is why we dont pay attention to it.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	Your question proves that you don't understand Keynesian economics.    "Keynes argued that the solution to depression was to stimulate the economy ("inducement to invest") through some combination of two approaches :    a reduction in interest rates.    Government investment in infrastructure - the injection of income results in more spending in the general economy, which in turn stimulates more production and investment involving still more income and spending and so forth. The initial stimulation starts a cascade of events, whose total increase in economic activity is a multiple of the original investment.[1]"|`|5ZfcMc34aa	Keynesians and supply-siders are both groups of morons who are trapped in a single theory and can't get out.    It will never occur to them that a bill could be produced incorporating the PROVEN aspects of both theories and playing both ends against the middle to solve the problem    Dogmatists are hopeless wanabe intellectuals that have no ability to deal with anything other than ideology.

They have most of the White Racists, and most of the blacks are democrats and nearly all of them are extremely racist, the largest and most openly biased and bigoted racist group in the country are democrat blacks. Then you have the Mexican groups like LaRasa, which means "the race" and it's like a nazi supremest group for Mexicans, but no one says anything to those lousy racists, as if only white people can be racist. Racism is nothing but a tool to hang whites who don't like favoritism given to democrat voting blocks at the detriment of all others. The democrats could care less about real racism, they are steeped in it and quite comfortable with it.    The democrats are also the party built on lies, and the truth would utterly destroy them. The democrats best weapon is to smear someone in the media and in the entertainment industry (both basically owned by the very richest people in the country who are the elite democrat billionaires), and smear them so bad no one will listen to them with an open mind, and to keep on it, defaming, lying and basically doing all they can to assassinate the character of those they see as a threat.     What did they do when Steele was elected head of the GOP? They immediately started in with the defamation and character assassination, much as they did with Palin, Judge Thomas, remember all the racist crap about Conalisa Rice? they of course did all they could to constantly defame Bush for that matter, Cheney ... and about everyone they want to discredit SO THEY NEVER HAVE TO DEAL WITH AN HONEST DEBATE ON FACTS ... Because that would be their undoing.|`|41ebd12ba67eeb8a3a4ac05bc524403caa	You obviously haven't a clue.

(100% black, no less) Who nominated Clarence Thomas to be the first black member of the Supreme Court?     Are you referring to the Democratic Party of Democratic Governor George Wallace, re-elected time and time again?    How about Democratic Sen. Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who singled out Miguel Estrada, Bush's affirmative action nominee as "especially dangerous" because "he is Latino."     When George Allen was caught on tape calling S.R. Sidarth a "macaca" - twice - he lied to the Washington Post when asked what macaca means.  Allen said: "I don't know what it means." George Allen knows exactly what macaca means-- his mother is French Tunisian and very well versed in French Tunisian curse words. George Allen has a long and ugly racist past.     Senator Robert Byrd is a former member of the Ku Klux Klan!     Howard Dean, the past Democratic chairman once remarked that "I still want to be the candidate for guys with Confederate flags in their pickup trucks." And what is that supposed to mean?    Do you want to EVEN discuss Vice President Biden's remarks about Senator Barack Obama, Indians, 7-eleven, and Iraq? I thought not...he was running AGAINST Barack last Spring when also said, in the Democratic Primary Debate, that he would be proud/honored to run against or with John McCain in this election.

i405qKokaa	As a Brit myself, the US is the land of opportunity. Bearing in mind that you can go to University in the UK, and leave without the chance of getting anything resembling a proper career-whereas you are pretty much guaranteed a good career and stable lifestyle in the US if you work hard at it-that's how I view the US. In fact, I owe my success to American people employing me, when I found it impossible to get work in the UK as I didn't have "the right connections", didn't "live in the right area" or go to "the right Uni". Americans are more willing to give people a break, rather than be judgemental and snobbish.  The tv isn't great, but tax is low and lifestyle is much better than UK. Healthcare is supreme to the abysmal healthcare in the UK (how many other countries are you told that it is impossible for a Doctor to see your baby at your house-typical British healthcare).   As for "the intelligence of its people", you can't pigeon-hole people. The Americans that I work with are intelligent and hard-working, although obviously we both have cultural differences that cloud our judgement sometimes.    That pretty much sums it up for me.|`|5CI2YHoqaa	Your the same as us really, although alot more patriotic overall we in the UK are rubbished for wanting the best for our fellow man. But Pres Bush did you guys no favours in the intelligence stakes.|`|V1dNF1vCaa	I don't think you can generalise on a culture's intelligence because everyone is so unique. We are all smarter than others at at least one thing. It's all down to the way we are taught and how we learn, but your education system isn't that much different to ours anyway.     Personally, I don't like it when I see Americans or UK citizen's on here making generalisations of any kind about how people from other countries behave.     There's no way you can take what you know about a handful of people and apply it to a population.|`|AA11705909	The President you have now is a great deal more intelligent than the last one you had.

Your general style of things tend to be much more full on than in britain, with things being bigger, louder and overstated.    As for your role in the world. Thats more down to the government than the average person. But i think that president bush did not represent you fairly, and did your image no favours.

I hear that schooling is pretty poor, but the vast majority of anyone's knowledge is obtained outside of school anyway, so that shouldn't matter.    I find the healthcare system a little uncaring, but hey, who am I to judge? I hear many Americans are wasteful, but this is just a generalisation to me.    I think the amount of flags would annoy Eskimos if they could see all that fabric not going towards making coats, and that without America there wouldn't be anywhere near as many good films, songs, books, etc.      I don't like generalising. I don't think you can put people in little pockets of "Brits," "Americans," Frenchies," etc. Everyone should be judged on who they actually are, not where they're from.|`|oLjrxLmIaa	The media portrays the world so much better than the us, Theres smart people and dumb people everywhere you, people need to stop generalizing|`|uq4ZuWnEaa	Dumb to say the least.  They play it big and Intelligent but most are not that well educated.   It is not their fault it is the institutions of America bending the facts to suit their ego.  The US role in the world is tyrannical at the least and non democratic. We are not educated on the tax system of America and to be quite honest we have enough with our own tax system without worrying about yours.  environment few people care their idea is do what we do as we like as long as the rest of the world cuts down its carbon emissions, day to day life not much different from the rest of the world, television you are the best at making rubbish programmes but very entertaining  I think America should stick at what it does best films both for tv and cinema.  Movies the best ever always have been socially/cultrally not to good  but then that is the case with the western world there is just no class it is all rather crass.  In general the Americans or the majority of them are nice normal people but they are brain-washed by their politicians into thinking that they are the cream of the cream.   Bad news they are not you are all just human beings just like the rest of us.  No better and no worse just Americans|`|BUGuJIk9aa	In general? No comment.|`|HRCFViataa	A reflection of how a person views a nation (in this case america), is more of a reflection of that person, than the nation in question.    In general i would say, america is one of the more educated populations of the world. However if i was to suggest a problem with america it would be, you tended (under bush) to be a little short sighted when came to other countries.  But i think that had a lot to do with what happen on 9/11.    I also think its become the fashion in this country (in the past couple of years) to bash america, which i blame on the lefty attitude which seems to be creeping in with ever closer integration with the E.U.    P.S I served my country in its armed force and im proud to be called a Brit, but i certainly dont like to be called a european.|`|GbiFRG5eaa	For the record, unlike another poster I am proud to be called a Brit lol.   I actively dislike generalisations, you cannot define a nation on how it is portrayed by/in the media.   As to the areas you question, my view is, again, biased by the media: The education system is crap unless you have loads of money. Your kids are checked for knives and guns before entering school. Only the rich can afford health care. Your tax system is very confusing. You turn your nose up at environmental issues, but hey I am totally with you on that one, we are all being conned. You make generally good movies and t.v.   Culturally and socially I think your society is more divided than us, despite the fact we invented the "class" system. Possibly because ours is based on lineage rather than wealth.     There is only really one thing that does annoy me, and unfortunately that does come via the media.  What is it? In a nutshell it can be summed up thus, you can have the most unattractive, unappealing individual on a tv show who is told "honey, sugar, you are beautiful/intelligent/amazing", when clearly they are anything but!  Is this a good thing? Are Americans boosting the confidence of the individual, ie anyone can achieve anything? Or is it a great big con to lull the populace into not improving their lot?   At the end of the day we are all just people, it is those who rule us that seek to divide us, the majority of us just want to live our lives in peace and harmony.  You are only as dumb as they want you to be, intelligence scares the crap out of those in power.  So what happened with Bush? roflmao. .   .|`|UBS4jIAcaa	personally i think that US residents with poorer education tend to be more verbal than the better informed ones.    less education = easier to indocrine     this makes millions of slogan shouting unthinking meatheads....    still here in blighty a lot of people just watch soap operas all day and are only intrested in celebrities, they take coke at the weekends without a thought of where it comes from and moan about the nhs when their bodies get messed up.    millions of sheep, just guzzling resorces and farting pollution. bird flu would be a good thing imo|`|szyUVMOlaa	if you look at nominating Bush twice, the whole Iraq fiasco, the rubbish healthcare system, gun culture... then not too bright! To be fair most of this is out of the control of the average citizen but I would say your image here is not too great.|`|LLigvFnTaa	Some wars are justified but some arent. Most things are fine but i dont like the way america has behaved as a super power. It could have averted a number of tragedies but it chose to be the dumb nation. Americans are too self contained and they lack the ability to respect other cultures not just the european.|`|hGFrwtgzaa	I think Americans are generally seen as quite ignorant people, which doesn't do much for their image. They're definitely not seen as one of the more intelligent nations.|`|DBuXLzjLaa	im english,from what ive seen of bush,and peoples views on obama,im not impressed,i think america is too big and diverse to be one country its difficult to explain but here in britain if something happens we are all closer together and never far away,although we dont all agree we are all together,thats my opinion anyhow
LqSciCrhaa	Hell no!!!    Enough said.|`|t3QAaSN9aa	The banks don't seem to be doing too well on their own.  Our tax money is already helping to keep them going. As long as the deposits are safe, what difference would it make.|`|TKbYavhzaa	All I'm saying is, if I have to pay for the banks with my tax-dollars, shouldn't I get to own a piece through my government?  I want to be able to fire the jerk-off that thinks he deserves a multimillion bonus for bankrupting my company.|`|Cni4Zh77aa	The banks are oligopolies anyways. What's the difference? Mom and Pop died when Reagan took over.|`|2m1hbw2iaa	Not by a long shot!|`|XPSIn3wxaa	I stopped trusting Banks  all of them  when they took my money, gave me .05% interest and then lent my money to you for 28% interest on your credit card and said that was legal.    They are money changers and deserve to go to jail  forever.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	These bailouts sicken me.  If a company is "too big to fail" then break it up and let the weak parts fail and the strong ones survive.
Hxttt7G0aa	That so called stimulus bill tells me everything I need to know. Anyone who would back that garbage is crooked as a dogs leg, or a complete moron.    How about in stead of using equalization without really looking into it, you get educated before you suggest that everyone is the same? Things are very different.    I'm not a republican, because I don't like much of what they do or stand for. I'm not a democrat because they are disgustingly corrupt and not held accountable by the media or entertainment industry which the elite billionaires own, who are almost all democrats. (while they in the media and entertainment industry hang that mantra on republicans using press and entertainment industry to push it and brain wash the people into accepting that as a paradigm).    Now sure, there are some on both sides, many in fact, who will see their party as their people, and never think they could be doing wrong. Just about the same dynamic as local sports teams and how they can do no wrong in a game against a hated rival, same idiotic thing.|`|Ocyrox5baa	Probably not.
KXHYBTWsaa	Hey, Angela.
BrjZhySIaa	Assumptions and generalizations are the top two traits exhibited by the sheep of America.  They usually obtain these traits through their exposure to the brainwashing propaganda machine, that most people call the mainstream media, as well as the publik edumacayshun system that teaches our youth a whole bunch of nothing (on purpose)  i.e. many grade school students were asked who they would vote for in the election if they were old enough to vote.  Their only choices?  Obama and McCain.      The sad part is that most of these sheep don't even realize they have been duped into this mind process.|`|	Oh!  you like the other guy = Hellary Clinton|`|	Probably for the same reason they assume you're a racist if you criticize him: They lack the cognitive thinking skills to argue rationally.|`|	I see a lot of assuming on this site. And it's not just one side doing it to the other.|`|	This is definitely annoying.  I did support Bush on many issues and I didn't support him on many issues but many of my friends who didn't support Bush but don't' like Obama are labeled racist if they criticize him or they are asked why they supported Bush.    This Obama love fest is getting old.  He ISN'T Jesus.|`|	Just because its dichotomy doesn't mean you like any of the options.|`|	They don't. But if you kept your mouth shut about Bush while he inflicted the damage he has on us, they wonder why you're suddenly paying attention.|`|	Same reason why if you criticize bush, people assume that you like obama.|`|	Probably because they lack the vision to realize that there are more than two answers to the question and that not everyone is a "goose-stepping" Republican or a "Godless Communist" Democrat!!:)     As a registered Libertarian I understand your plight!! I liked Ron Paul but voted for our candidate Bob Barr in the general election.    Don't let them get you down!! One may get drowned in this world of ignorance but the last thing they will see of me is my extended middle finger!! Fight them until the bitter end says I!!!!!!!!!|`|	Because these same people "think"correction, are of the opinion thatObama is a "liberal."|`|	Because they only know Democrat  and  Republican. They didn't know about Independent party.. hahahahhahah      Independent party would make good president.|`|	DUDE THAT HAPPENED TO ME TOO!    Somebody PMd me. I guess they saw something I said about the USA PATRIOT Act. He (she?) asked me if I liked Obama. I said no.    He accused me of being a Bush-loving republican. I told him I was not.    He accused me of being a racist. I again told him I was not.    Then he was really confused. I told him he was making assumptions based on generalizations.    Just because everyone else fits into a little dichotomous box doesn't mean we do!|`|	Just tell then    Assumption B the Mutha of Disata !|`|	because YA much like the country is overrun with silly repubs and dems.. while the whole time the few independents and libertarians just LOL@ them..|`|	Those who do so, are brain washed that there are only two political alternatives. This is not so because there are many other Parties like the Libertarians or the greens|`|	Is is called arrogance they like to feel there vote had purpose. Those of us with ta three digit iQ know they are all CFR puppets. Folks changing the actor does not alter the script are you all so delusional|`|	it only confirms the ignorance. America has lost it's way. it is easy to distract ignorant people by placing other issues to cry about. it's like a baby crying and you give them a rattle.   if you appear to not like the rattle then you are different and the babies don't understand why.|`|	yeah, no kidding. two evils from two different sides of the room.|`|	For the same reason that if you criticize Bush they want to paint you with the "unAmerican" label.  The mentality that you belong in Box A or Box B - there are NO other "boxes" as far as they are concerned.       I love to engage the men I work with, because they have all bought into the neo-con "stuff" and they assume that because I haven't I MUST be a liberal.  That I fully support Ron Paul totally baffles them.  When I criticize something, I get told "you just want the government to solve everything."      NO I DO NOT.  Talk about people that don't pay attention.    I do NOT want the government to ANYTHING that the Constitution does not specifically state it SHOULD do.  PERIOD.    They just don't get it.   Rational thought no longer exists in America.  How sad is that?|`|	They assume.    ***/u/me
8DPRGTvPaa	Don't let the people on Y!A get to you. It's a place to get some insight on how people think but it certainly doesn't reflect the thinking of all Americans, no matter what category they fall into.     People need someone to be the fall guy and when you personally don't like someone, it's easy to point the finger at them.|`|KrrXT6ocaa	i think you have a shallow thought process.    the right thing is merely your opinion.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Shoot them.    They need to stand in line right behind the horse's asses that said the same thing about Bush.|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	Gotta love this fascist fashion being flaunted by the party in power!!!|`|AA11313983	The same thing that happened to the people who said that about Bush.|`|SGyRIjCIaa	HA HA HA    The first answer is absolutely fantastic. Couldn't have said it better myself!    --EDIT--Who said that President Obama is doing the right thing? Besides Jay Z or Oprah or one of his sheep. Really, I'm talking someone with real economic intelligence.. You give me the name of someone respectable who said that and then we'll talk.     And no it is never "okay" to bash the President but the liberals taught us all quite well how to bash a President.|`|4zijn0cgaa	They should be applauded because they got it right.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Do nothing to them.    It's their right to feel that way just as it was my right to despise Bush when he messed things up.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	lol if thats the case you might as well put me on death row, I will never support a lying baby killer. Your proposal sounds an awful lot like tyrany to me.|`|MM8rqTMtaa	Welcome back.  How was your exile during the Bush years?    You don't quite have a grasp of the whole liberty concept, do you?|`|GGJ8T6uYaa	I think they should be given the same opportunity to speak their minds, just like the liberals did with regard to George Bush and his policies.  Or have you forgotten how poorly GW was treated by the liberal press and Democrats in general in recent years?  Should their fate be the same as that you speak of?|`|CBx6qHztaa	Cool.  I like the way the dems are starting to sound.  I knew it was in them to be the most devisive hateful beings known to man.      I love the tolerance they display on every level.    Stay classy...|`|pVdV4gwgaa	Nothing. Leave them alone. Some people are just stubborn. When they stop being bitter about their candidates loss then maybe they might consider supporting THEIR president. It's just very unpatriotic.|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	The should be given the Congressional Medal of Honor for standing firm against communism.    Long Live the United States of America!|`|NA38sBLqaa	It would be nice to have a President that is actually Constitutional qualified rather than one that hides their true birthplace from the voters.  It is rather difficult to support a President (no matter their politics) that refuses to release their sealed birth certificate especially when the Constitution calls for the President to be a natural born citizen.|`|t82AcQT1aa	I do hope they come to try and deport me. I have "presents" for them.|`|joh3VNcZaa	He isn't going to do what is right.  Why support the wrong policies?|`|PTnPKurQaa	They should be deported for disagreeing with the president?  You, sir, are a hypocrite.|`|2e405d18fda0a031cdc970b9510cd13caa	Really.  So do I get on the same flight with Rosie o'dipshit and the rest of the rabid libs who said the same thing about Bush?  Hope you can take care of yourself, 'cuz you're gonna be one dam' lonely person here all by yourself...    O-Sambo AIN'T MY President...|`|WQONdh1Laa	What will happen to those people is that their lives will suck because they're messed up. As we all know, OBAMA DOMINATES.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	If we were to punish anyone who lacked support for their President, every single one of us would be guilty at one point or another.     This is the United States, and the beauty of our freedom is that we have the freedom to speak out against our leaders.|`|YczLYtWjaa	the same thing that was done to those who did not support Bush........nothing|`|B1VxBl2paa	Deported over disagreeing with an illegal alien like Hussein Obama?    LOL|`|Q6ZQlMLpaa	People should support their leaders until those people give reasonable reason not to be supported.  Call it anti-American or what ever you wish when someone will not give a chance.  Obama has just got into office and is trying to get us on our feet.  Sure there is things in his package I disagree with, but with any package you will find those who disagree with it.  It is all where you are in life and what you believe in is right.  That is the beauty of living in America, we can voice our opinion.  But to not support our president, is a person who has no intention to succeed at all.|`|OYWKu6ouaa	Why should we support anyone who has policies that we don't agree with?  That's like saying, "Oh well I don't think government funding should go towards abortion, but if we give it a chance then I might agree with it."  It doesn't make sense.  I will never support Obama.  Not now, Not ever!!
8dc5NMexaa	Generally, yes, if an adult.  State laws will control and state laws vary.  State laws may prevent name change if: 1) there are pending criminal charges; 2) there are prior criminal charges to which you are on probation or parole; 3) there is an intent to avoid civil or criminal obligations or doing so in the course of committing fraud.    Court costs depend on the county in which you reside.  Esti. $200.00  Attorney's fees will range from esti. $200 - $1,000.  Shop around.  Do-it-yourself will costs only court costs, time, effort, uncertainty, possible embarrassment, confusion and possibly result in giving-up.|`|YjV1MLLVaa	Yes you can but it requires alot of time and money.|`|d9e367846b5ba5a880e1207e0d7a113baa	Depends on the state, I would research legal name change.|`|3af30c08175e2bc96bcd85540e09d175aa	Depends on what state you live in.

Its a way to keep yourself informed without fearing what you find out. You follow the facts and evidence no matter where i takes you and in the end you might benefit from it.  However, i'm a pretty thourough person, i'm rarely wrong when it comes to history and what one should learn from what we have already done in the past. I might venture an opinion from time to time, but unlike many of the leftist i battle, i know my opinion is just that....an opinion.....and I state it as such. I also realize it might just be wrong too...but that's why I support it.  The common leftist emotional idiot today that you encounter usually base things on their flawed emotions... Some kind of Dr. Spock BS that if you feel it , it is true. Which has recently been proven to be a false notion and one that Dr. Spock himself tried to reverse 11 years after his book was out.

Wouldn't it be better if Barney Frank were held accountable for his misdeeds regarding Fannie Mae, specifically when he claimed it was financially sound when in fact, it was far from it? Wouldn't it be better if the government hadn't forced banks to write loans to people who didn't qualify, under the guise of "fairness"?

Smoke that.|`|6oASoFr7aa	This dude wasn't even a republican heading into the GOP, he's obviously someone there preping to run against Obama 2012, but I doubt he has what it takes and I doubt he will make it through the primaries.|`|9kx7KDFLaa	No|`|YMFo5N2haa	very interesting|`|oLjrxLmIaa	No i wouldnt go that far|`|gRfqjemmaa	I think you are racist. I have heard Mike Steele talk many times over the past two years. I have heard him take over for talk show hosts when they are off. He is a very good man. I Like him. Never seen a picture of him, who cares if he is black.  Obama went to MD to talk down Mike, urged the crowd to NOT vote for Mike. Because he is a conservative, he was called an Uncle Tom, an Oreo. He had Oreo cookies thrown at him. You talk like the racist my friend.|`|nmmX87IBaa	the GOP gave us the first black Supreme Court Justice, the first black Secretary of State, the first black female Secretary of State.|`|yprHJNHAaa	Rush Limnaugh is the true head of the RNC...the republicans in congress are following his lead.  Rush wants Obama to fail and the republicans are going to make it their priority.      Steele...I really did not care for his arrogance as Lt. Governor of MD...and when he appeared on talk shows he was just as arrogant.  No...Mr Arrogance is in Texas...and OUT of the White House.  The US needs to move on....and we can do a lot better.|`|oBL3AtRfaa	I can't beat God's Reporter's answer. He is absolutely right.    The GOP will pull for whoever they think has the best chance of winning. So if the door was closed before (and it wasn't), it's certainly open now. No experience necessary!|`|haXKbqwRaa	Naw, Sarah Palin is much better.|`|PTnPKurQaa	Not until he becomes more conservative.|`|AA10937947	NOOOOO!!!!  republicans should be looking for the best candidate not just the brown ones!!  I'm glad Bobby Jindal has more sense...|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I don't think he would be the right person to head the ticket. So No.|`|4zKmOkI4aa	check back in 3 years|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	The first 100% Black Political Leader with integrity!    Micheal Steele '12|`|NMaCcyeKaa	I kind of doubt it.  Also, I'm not sure if the chairman of the party can run for the presidential nomination.  Part of the chairman's job is to help coordinate and run the primaries, not to actually run in the primaries.
024Pu2XRaa	Unlike Obama, Michael Steele has fought for everything he has earned in his life. He's not the chosen one. He actually is an independent thinker who is not afraid to follow his beliefs.|`|ZxtEh7yZaa	Yes the first 100% Black Leader with integrity in American Politics!    Micheal Steele '12|`|AA11702773	I don't know yet.  All I really know about him is that he is black.  The people calling him 'a true conservative' aren't all people I consider to be true conservatives, themselves.  However, I'll look into him and develop an opinion over time.|`|ZOXoPgJbaa	no steele is just another war mongering neo con. Dont let him fool you. Ron Paul is the only real change you can believe in.

Those who were dishing out the smear looked bad for doing it.|`|1FkYHLXDaa	I give up........how.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Fox is one voice against an army of media Liberalism.      Chris Mathews from MS-NBC shot his wad over Obama.   He probably has a poster of Obama over his bed and plays with himself for hours while starring at it.|`|CBynwmKwaa	you tell me...|`|aYsPBtXHaa	they dont choose|`|fN3aXySWaa	Maybe they were doing some good journalism...truth has a well-known liberal bias.|`|VuaOKpYXaa	The only network less biased than Fox was CSPAN  http://newsbusters.org/blogs/rich-noyes/...    The rest of the media was completely biased in Obama's favor which is why he won  68% positive stories about Obama vs 36% positive stories about McCain|`|5YTkGB5yaa	Fox News couldn't compete with Obama's false promises of government entitlements.
6OLiuM9Gaa	I have long said that President Obama should be given a chance.    First thing he did was to pick a political ploy in lieu of attending a event honoring CMH recipients.    The second thing he did was sell out Guantanamo to the pacifists... and the terrorists.    He promised to cut the military budget 25%, eliminate "unnecessary" military spending, and to halt funding on research and development. Here's the first step.    I'm watching. All I've seen so far are what appear to be nothing more than steps to eliminate the US military.    Or 16,044,340 E-7s for 1 year. Just think... 16 million seasoned veterans...    I'm wondering... is it time to get nervous yet?|`|AA10025824	No more bug juice on Submarines.  Clean the toilets with toothpaste instead.|`|IUXriZQJaa	This is OBama's first step in clearing up funds for his brownshirt "civilian army."|`|6Fsliwlhaa	Out of that 55 billion, whic service is getting hit the hardest?  Or is it an even split?  The military pays people to figure this out, so I'm sure they'll cut a few projects.|`|M7oAG5Aiaa	Anyone of those that you have listed would be a fine start, with the exception of the pay raises for military personnel|`|AA11163314	The really shame is that the pork bill he is pushing would have created more jobs in the US if they spent some of the money on defense items.    Just for example: by reprogramming $55 billion from wasted and pork we could in effect bring out entire F-22 fleet up to the strength that the Air Force needs for a major war - and provide jobs for close to 10,000 people for the next four years.  Not only that - these would all be good, well paying jobs in aerospace which would strengthen the middle class.|`|JsDID6gJaa	DOD is the only department liberals cut...
fSlZQzS4aa	Dealing with your problem is a local responsibility.|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Hopefully nothing, you CHOOSE where you live, the government does NOT make you live where it gets that friggin cold|`|r8tpwmixaa	Paying off rich bankers?|`|y4wwMI4Oaa	While Obama is eating $100 per pound Filet Mignon, steak!    His personal chef commented on CNN how Obama likes his cuts to perfection,  it is a disgrace to show that on National TV, when America is hurting so much!|`|HIY7oeWBaa	What do you expect, Obama lets his brother live in a hut in Africa with mud walls on $ 1.00  a day!
kzNnMrMHaa	Some are but most are still engaged in the partisan rhetoric that diverts their attention away from the real issues of the corruption and greed that encompasses both parties and their leadership. Politicians like this because it creates smoke for them to hide behind.|`|eQPy6KP2aa	Thank you|`|t82AcQT1aa	You are correct. And we lose again.|`|ehjKpv0Waa	true. both do not know what hard times are, just think they are making decisions for the people.|`|DiDCG9UBaa	Apparently not too many people get that (especially on this site).|`|W8VmNhJQaa	I don't agree. One party is trying to do better for the world and one party is trying to better for themselves.

I am in debt up to my *** and my little mom and pop store isn't flourishing.  My employees haven't been paid in a month.    I ask for a "loan" to help get my company back on its feet and I am granted said "loan".    Instead of paying my bills and my employees, I go out and spend the money on 3000 pairs of shoes.    Which employee will hunt me down and kill me first?  Or will a posse be sent out?|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Or for the execs to fly to a country that does not allow for extradition?|`|FX4WhQtKaa	nothing, they can fly it over the ocean and try and land it there , I want to see if they can land it in troubled waters like they have put us into.|`|8DPRGTvPaa	You realize that was your tax money given to them to help the company stay in business.. right? Imagine your friend crying the blues because they are broke and you feel bad and give them money from your pocket (and you being low on cash yourself) only to find out that they went on a shopping spree and bought new clothes and other unnecessary things. Citigroup already has 5 jets, why do they need a 50 Mil dollar jet? They don't even need the 5 they have and for them to throw money around like that is a slap in the tax payers face.... When AGI sent their executives on lavish weekends, that was on the same caliber as this.|`|KWa9vPVQaa	Like I have said before, we need to be rioting in the streets, over the fact that these pigs, are hording in their trough's anyone out there see this?|`|tdG5409Uaa	So with ALMOST A TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT AND so much americans need as 1, with wars and crisis breaking out at any moment, do you really think it's alright to give someone who laid off thousands, of thousands, of jobs some billions of dollars and let them go and buy a F***king jet, Come on , you sound like Rush, the republicans Leader, no i mean ,GOD|`|O1Unx5RUaa	let those capitalist slobs take the bus
c2hfVjxgaa	No one should be killed because of political views.  The fighting should take place in debate and exchange of ideas.|`|oLjrxLmIaa	I dont like obama but i would not want him to be killed i like bush and id be mad about that|`|pPkFPP8Gaa	I didn't vote for Carter, Bush, Clinton or Obamma.    If any former or current president were assanated or killed, I'd want to drop a nuclear bomb on the nation responsible.    They are our presidents/leaders.  I didn't vote for them but they are still ours.|`|MqXbtvP9aa	Bush: death would too easy an out for "W". He should be slowly tortured by forcing him to live with himself with the knowledge that he murdered hundreds of thousand of innocent people.    There is a place reserved for him in hell.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I'd be upset if any President was assassinated. That would mean the Secret Service failed AGAIN.|`|ukBX5OOsaa	I am a Democrat, and I'd be outraged if Bush, Obama or anyone got assassinated.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	Bush would be unaffected. As far as anyone would know, he'd just be the same old George Bush.
AA10726404	How has 2001-Present been an example of America doing well?  Have you seen the economy lately?|`|MEReSvZeaa	Al Qaida has been a common enemy for the last 15 years.    America would be fine if liberals weren't on the side of the terrorists all the time.|`|vFHXrOHNaa	We are living in a society so afraid of the word Nazi that we punish someone who names his child Hitler.     There are many people with that last name and first name Adolf  in Austria from the 1940 still alive, why are we afraid of the name in US that the social services takes away the children who are otherwise well cared for and are not learning anything associated with hating anyone?    I am not a Jew or White Supremacist. I belong to minority community.    I think we need to deal with the new terror which has no single face more vigorously than we are Dealing  with non existing Nazi threat.    Islamic Terror has been spreading thought the world under the guise of Freedom Fight and Muslim Oppression, This is going on for over the last 1000 years not only 15 as some here suggested.    Islamic Jihadi elements can not live in peace example is Hamas which gained Victory in election and had a free land to administer instead they Choose to Attack Israel.    Wake up World.|`|3wyxasucaa	The reason why you have enemies is because you keep helping the Jews.|`|l3moIem5aa	Yeah because everything has been going just swimmingly since 2001.|`|yvPA8FSsaa	Not just America but any country or group for that matter.    *|`|DiDCG9UBaa	You missed the "Red Scare". Read "1984" and you'll understand why some politicians think they need to distract the populace with an outside enemy.|`|09neUq82aa	2001-now we haven't had a common enemy.    Since 1991 America hasn't had a cause. There's so little to do in the world it's actually declared war on a concept.      Personally, I don't see why America needs a cause, but whatever.
AA10124897	I wish the Democrats would just admit that they can screw up the economy better than anyone else... but don't expect a democrat to fix it...    We know it's bad... I am happy to see, after the democrats have shown NO bipartisan attitude, they are out on a limb with this bill.  They have put all their collective eggs in one basket, and history shows we can expect some scrambled this time.|`|vpEDVEiKaa	Yes! But to little to late the vast majority voted for Bushes BS stimulus package when 9/10 Americans said not to do it!|`|aGzLO9Oraa	In my opinion, nobody should have voted on this bill until the public was made aware of what it contains so the people would have a chance to contact their representatives with a little bit of knowledge on the subject.  Its our money  but they act like its none of our business.|`|ex6fUw8Vaa	Soooooooo proud!!! They all know that the shite is going to hit the fan.|`|4zijn0cgaa	Yes the Dems can sink and drown alone on that ship.|`|mZi7R0Enaa	He!! Yes, I am so proud of their solidarity and doing what is right by this country. God bless Conservative values.|`|nmmX87IBaa	Yep.....I love the fact that the Republicans are making it impossible for the Democrats to lay the coming economic failure at their feet.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Jon Stewart put it best.    The Republicans wanting more tax cuts is like your grandmother always pushing chicken noodle soup.    "Grandma, I don't want it, I have a broken leg."|`|2CxfFENRaa	YES I love it, from what I hear the Republican senate and many more Democrats( blue dog dems) in senate will say no deal to this massive pork bill !!!!!|`|oBL3AtRfaa	It was the best possible move they could have made.|`|y25zmY2Gaa	There is hardly any "stimulus" to this bill.  All this millions and billions to start STD programs and handout contracetives. How is that going to stimulate anything. I disagree that its a total pork bill. (the first stimulus was almost all pork)  It has good ideas for our country, but unfortunately most of the ideas will not create or stimulate anything.     I'm glad the GOP in the house stood against this. I doubt the senate will follow suit though. We'll see!!|`|d9afb5f10eed7750b0b4604b351f8e22aa	I certainly do, but unless they want the house, senate and president to be all Dems, they better get a backbone.  WE have had enough  foolish spending.  I am mad as Hell and I am not going to take it anymore.|`|TM2yK8nQaa	I certainly do. I wish the Republican Senators would take the hint and grow a spine, but I doubt it will happen.    I would like to see democrats take responsibility for not only the mess in the FannieMae/FreddieMac thing, but for perpetuating the circumstances that will prolong this blip on the financial radar.  I doubt it will happen in my lifetime, but then, I never thought to see the Berlin Wall come down either.|`|3f7UV5zDaa	Hopefully the Senators will do the same.|`|PTnPKurQaa	About time they put on their conservative hats.|`|ede631d26044cdcaddb21e9dbec2bdb7aa	Now that Bush "the fiscal liberal" is gone, conservatives can stand for principles.

It will be interesting to see whom they truly represent, us or pro illegal special interest groups.|`|uPNP1xzpaa	don't be so short-sighted and no common sense like those republican voted for no because they did not even read the details which the bill was given to them to read since the inauguration day. Didn't you see those republican senates lied to American citizens right in front of the TV interview and got corrected by the TV host?    Those stimulus plan will increase job and give tax benefits to poor people and takes care of American people health problems and tighten the security.    Some of you might not agree but please focus on the fact, not just use some information told by your imaginary friend or your own one way ignorant thinking. Before you ask a question that is like making a statement, try to read through those 600 pages first before making your own judgement. They said ignorant is a bliss, obviously it is for those self-fish people. God bless America.|`|1219d6000cca01c9f3c4489d1c7b4a16aa	"Scratched my head when I saw STD Research. Give Trojans a Kickback."    It's the first time you'll see anyone promote the idea that condoms increase 'stimulus' :D
AA11117716	Apply.    Applying doesn't commit you to anything.  Give yourself as many options as possible upon graduation.  You don't have to pay anything, so there is no reason you shouldn't apply.    I am assuming from your question that you understand the basics of ROTC.  You do not get to completely pick where you are stationed upon graduation, but you get to request where you would like to go from a large list of options.  Based on your desires, performance and the Navy's needs, you will be assigned a position and station most accommodating for all.    Most major public universities offer some sort of ROTC program, and Navy ROTC is certainly a common one.  I believe they are listed on the Navy's website, but I know that any school offering the program will have it on their website.  This is a nice feature of the ROTC program - you get to choose where you go to school (for the most part).    Your "pay" will depend on the school, as the ROTC program has tuition caps.  Your best source of information on pay would be to contact the school of your choice (offering NROTC), and ask to speak with one of the Navy ROTC Officers.  They will be able to provide you with an information package, including a list of exactly how much money you would be paid, to include explanations of how that pay is broken down.    Most NROTC programs do not actually send you to the Navy Boot Camp.  You will, however, likely be involved in some sort of summer initiation program, filled with boot camp-like activities.  A Navy ROTC Officer at the school of your choice would best be able to describe the experience.  If you are fit enough to meet Navy Physical Fitness requirements, you will be able to complete this program.  Mental devotion will be the real testament to your ability to succeed.  The programs are always difficult, but never impossible.
AA11481889	It makes me feel like we should bring home all our boys and girls and set them in a ring around the country, blocking our borders and use all our saved money to repair the country, and to hell with everyone else.  Let all those nut jobs kill each other.    How'd we get signed up to be global baby sitters in the first place?    I can see the logic in making sure that we've got the biggest guns...but quite frankly...I'm more concerned with our hungry and poor and dying.      I think we have to focus on our problems and let everyone else deal with their own messes.    We need to start manufacturing here and stop buying foreign crap.    We need to close the doors to this country...period.    We need to repair ourselves and we can't do it if we buy foreign, or funnel out our money for foreign welfare or warfare, or try to fix someone else's problems.    Charity begins at home.|`|oLjrxLmIaa	Wtf|`|rUNlmQG5aa	It's a disgrace- I wonder how they let the information come out? Hitler used to set up little model cities of Jewish people and 'political prisoners' and then let the Red Cross visit to make sure that everything was acceptable for public consumption.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	He rocks.  As to the poster you mentioned Ron Paul.  Yeah, I love a racist who loves only money and not other people.      Woooo Woo  down thumbs train by all the teens who think they understand libertarianism.|`|zB7Hl7x2aa	ahh,the ufo seeing K.he's a radical liberal,therefore,he is not to be tak'in seriously!!|`|2e405d18fda0a031cdc970b9510cd13caa	Complete bullshit.  If he is so concerned about what is going on in Gaza, maybe he should stop bitching about Isreal and stand against Hamas.  Hamas is a terrorist organization that forced people to "vote" for them so that they would be "elected".  Their main purpose is elimination of Israel, and the US.  So, they started shooting rockets into Isreal, and when our Jewish buddies had enough, and fought back, the terrorists, like the "real men" that they are, hid behind civilians.    So, **** the people in Gaza.  Extreme case of "don't bring a knife to a gunfight"  Piss off Israel, get your *** kicked.  What part of that do they not understand?|`|9HvHmwTNaa	sounds like he thinks that Israel was suppose to succumb to terrorist attempts and threats against them and allow hammas to continue bombing them without bombing back...Israel is being crucified only because their military was stronger......if someone shot rockets into your own backyard would you ask them over for a picnic or would you fight back?.....again those that speak against Israel are only speaking for terrorist organizations trying to make the world think that it is alright to kill someone because of religion, but it is not alright to defend yourself against such attacks.|`|IUXriZQJaa	excuse me?    So it is perfectly all right to for Hamas and Hezbollah to lob grenades and launch rockets into Israel's markets, schools, hospitals, Synagogues, government offices, streets and sidewalks, send suicide bombers with nailbombs to  murder their women children on the buses, in the markets, etc, drive car bombs into masses of innocent people, send gunmen in to terrorize the whole country and call for the nuclear annihilation of the country, but Israel is wrong for fighting back?    Perhaps Daschel expects us all to be that blind., gullible  and stupid, but most people are not.  ,|`|MEReSvZeaa	You know, liberals have always told us that we trained and armed OBL.

Columbia, Guatemala, Panama, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, and the list could go on and on.  So what are you proposing?  Selling no arms to any country anywhere in the world?  Nice thought, naive but nice.  And if the US wasn't selling countries all around the world arms then who would be?  Who would be selling their influence across the globe?  China, Russia, and several others.  It's great he talks about the known problem but he offers no solutions.
ONWCXzUMaa	The only concerns I have are with the free trade between Canada and the U.S.A. dealing with the steel issue. I don't have nothing against Obama, I really hope he works out for your country, I've always been pro American, but this issue could change my mind, if they won't let Canada deal in the steel, then I would say it's time for Canada, to stop dealing with out water, over water powers over have the eastern states. I think that is the answer we should give to Obama, if he follows through on this steel issue. I know he's coming to Canada sometime in  Feb. and I hope the talks go will, then I'll make a small judgement on the man. But until then I wish him all the best.  take care  dave|`|lvBUl3Zdaa	You forgot Nixon's "War on Drugs", a war we've been losing for more than 30 years.

Former President Bush, did the best job that he could do with a Democratic House and Senate that blocked almost every attempt by Bush to revive the economy before we were facing more difficulties in regard to unemployment and the loss of housing.  Obama is quick to blame Former President Bush, instead of telling the American people who the real architect for the problems are that we are facing.  It wasn't hard to miss after the Inauguration that the Carter's snubbed the Clinton's, in the Capital before the luncheon. Evidently, Jimmy and Bill are feuding over something

zjpB2GARaa	I'm not as concerned about Limbaugh and Olbermann as I am about the people who pretend to be "objective" in order to push their view point more effectively.  Isn't it better that people be honest about what they believe?  There is no such thing as an "unbiased" news source.    Most people lack the critical thinking skills necessary to think for themselves and are incapable of developing those skills.  The fatal conceit of modernity is to assume that the masses of people are capable of making informed judgments about complex ideas.  Whereas the great thinkers throughout most of history recognized that the masses were incapable of being properly educated, modern man has an unfortunate prejudice in favor of the masses and "democracy" (which is nothing more than the rule of the intelligent by the unintelligent).    Unfortunately, I think it is impossible to restore the aristocratic republic of the Founders, as the masses will never allow that, so we are probably best off just waiting until everything has been run into the ground (which probably won't be long).|`|FJ5GEKlAaa	Yeah, check out O-bots.

Personally, I would love it if our so-called "education system" were to focus on teaching students HOW to think and reason, rather than telling them WHAT to think. Colleges, are especially guilty of this. Once bastions of free thinking and debate, they are now wrapped up in politically correct speech codes, and blatantly biased professors.

And I agree.|`|Mhm3J5g0aa	At least Rush will give you the facts that are irrefuteable and to this day can't be debated by the left side.  Sure, we all know that media in general no matter which side has to have a certain degree of entertainment value. What is amazing though is how the left can live in their little protected lie of how great their cause is without addressing the known failtures through out history.  Rush is one of the last hold outs for Conservatism, and its been shown many times already in history that conservatism has brought America back form economic ruin, but are we trying these known to help methods ? NO, we are going with the liberalism and socialist method of bail outs, hand outs, interferring with the free market.  And its all gets a pass by the lib media, its getting a pass with the ignorant American's of old that don't understand the economy and the young idiots that have graduated not as thinking adults, but schooled and indoctrinated by liberal professors and marxist swaying teachers.  And this isn't transparent to you ? The country use to be more sensible but has opted to selfish attitudes of not trying to make the country a better place...but by forcing change...like messing with oil companies funding, dirty politics, corrupt pay offs, green movement pressure on the government for something they can't even prove is happening.  How about the deception that the democrats were responsible for the civil rights movement when history show's it was the republicans that passed it.  What about the $6.5 Trillion plus wasted on the War on Poverty or FDR's "new Deal". The waste of time, resources and money has adequately been documented yet you leftist persist in the stupidity of thinking your system will work.  We don't have to make socialism or liberalism work in America, we have our own way of doing things and with the government out of the way, the free market and capitalism has come back every time.  That isn't some brainwashed mentality, but history...proven.  Every great nation that incorporated socialism at its core has fallen...with China as the last hold out... .whom is now changing their ways in a changing world since they know military power and human rights violations will no longer be tolerated as it has been.  I'm not suggesting every word that comes from Mr. Limbaughs mouth is golden, he is full of his own brand of humor, parody and suggestions. But when he points at someone and calls them what they are...on both sides of the political fence. You have nothing you can say, because these people really did do it.  His Opinions aside, he lets you know what these legislators are doing.  Didn't Bill and Hilary Clinton get illegal contributions from foreign nationals from China ?  Didn't the library get alot of contributions form the middle east ?  Didn't Jack Mertha call our troops thugs and murderers ?  Didn't Harry Reid call the war lost before we even were fully engaged ? And the surge not working before it got into position ?  Didn't Nancy Pelosi say this would be the most clear and honest Congress ?  Didn't most of the people responsible for the economic downturn come from Goldman sachs and democrats bad policy..Like Clinton's Community Reinvestment Act ? They forced people to make bad loans and Obama and ACORN sued Citigroup for not making these bad loans ?  These are all truths, and all from the left leaning democrat party. The evidence is out there, I'm amazed at the tenacity, stupidity and selfish behaviour for the left to pretend its not the truth, not known and doesn't make a difference.  This is corruption, this is wastefullness of our resources, this has effected all of America for a political party to try and elevate themselves and maintain power. Which is what Rush has said. I don't need Rush to tell me the obvious, I only rely on him for dates and who it was.  I'll tell you leftists a truism that you can't avoid. Your opinion means Nothing in the face of facts and data.

Federal efforts throughout the affected areas include:    Region IV:  The President signed an Emergency Declaration for the Commonwealth of Kentucky that can provide state and local officials with financial assistance for emergency protective measures        * Regional Response Coordination Center was activated and is working with Emergency Support Functions 1, 3, 6, 7, 8 and 11. These include working with federal partners in the areas of transportation, public works, mass care, logistics, public health and agriculture, and natural resources.      * An Interim Operating Facility Mobile Command Post, a FEMA Emergency Response Team, and the federal coordinating officer assigned to the disaster, are en route to the Kentucky State Emergency Operations Center (EOC).      * National Logistics Staging Area team members are traveling to Fort Campbell, Ky. to coordinate incoming federal supplies.      * Federal supplies en route include; 50 generators, 12 truckloads of water and six truckloads of meals.    Region VI:  On January 28, 2009, the President signed an Emergency Declaration for the State of Arkansas for Severe Winter Storm that occurred January 26 and continuing. The declaration authorizes FEMA to provide emergency protective measures, limited to direct federal assistance, under the Public Assistance Program at 75 percent federal funding for 48 counties.        * Regional Response Coordination Center was activated and is working with ESF 3 in the area of public works and engineering.      * Five Individual Assistance Preliminary Damage Assessment (PDA) Teams and four Public Assistance PDA Teams are prepositioning in Arkansas to be used as requested by the state.      * Two Mobile Disaster Recovery Centers and the Region VI Incident Management Assistance Team were deployed to the Arkansas State Emergency Operations Center (EOC) in Little Rock, along with the federal coordinating officer assigned to this disaster.      * Mission Assignments were completed with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for generator support. Generators are en route to the National Logistics Staging Area in Jonesboro to complement those already prepositioned in Fayetteville.      * One trailer of water and one trailer of meals were delivered to the Arkansas Department of Emergency Management at Camp Robinson in North Little Rock. In addition, one trailer of water and one trailer of meals were delivered to the logistics staging area in Jonesboro. Two trailers of water and two trailers of meals were delivered to the logistics staging area in Fayetteville.      * Members of the FEMA Debris Planning and Response team are en route to the Arkansas State EOC to assist with debris operations.      * The Oklahoma state EOC has returned to normal operations.

People who are void of any common sense whatsoever will find some screw ball way of tying Bush to this ice storm.      Hey I want to know what Al Gore is going to do with Redoubt Volcano in Alaska.  It's supposed to blow its top any time now and all that crap spewed into the atmosphere can't be a good thing.

You want Obama to visit - roughly - Oklahoma to Kentucky and the Midwest to the Atlantic Ocean because Bush was criticized for being unable to find the Superdome in New Orleans, even with nightly video reports about the 100,000 people who had taken refuge there and were begging for someone to come to their rescue.     Maybe you should look for a better analogy.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I find comparisons between Katrina and the recent ice storms ridiculous.  In Katrina over 1,800 people died and more than 700 are still missing.  The count for the current storm is less than 50 and a good chunk of that are those killed in traffic accidents or staying outside too long (rather than the few who have been killed because their power is off).  I don't want to minimize their deaths, but the two disasters are completely different.    Now what do you expect Obama to do about people who insist on driving or people who get hypothermia from shoveling their driveways?  Maybe he should make everyone in the midwest stay inside until June.  Yes, there are deaths from power going down, but seriously, Obama is already giving federal disaster aid to many of these states, it looks like he is responding to the storm, what else do you want him to do?

I happen to think STDs are in the realm of public health and as  such its important to cure them, think of it as saving future babies from illness, as some are passed on to the baby.  And since I know you are antiabortion, I also know you must feel for some child who could be saved from a lifetime of disease by using your money.  Right?    You do a disservice to all families who struggle with the addiction of one member, if they spend money to help the addict the addict still finds ways around it.

What a class family.    Of course, the truth is going to come out soon about Obama's Kenyan birth and fraud, and he'll be impeached and maybe arrested.    Biden will probably become President, and even though he's also a scumbag, nothing is as bad as Obama.    Is George Obama in with street gangs and the local mob in Kenya? Of course, we already know about Bill Ayers and reverend Wright, with his cursing and damnation of America sermons.    Why haven't we heard about "Geoge Obama" until now? More covering of the bad stuff?|`|UuyCVr3Taa	Oh well,they just cut off one of Obama's suppliers.  He still has Hawaii,for the Maui Wowee.|`|tdG5409Uaa	Actually is it your fault that someone in your family is a crack attic or drunkie, or maybe gay and support gay marriage.|`|2xa4414maa	The election is over. The man is your president. Deal with it.|`|KVBTtF9faa	No, it doesn't sound like a good or noble fellow. Why won't he help his own? He's rich enough, he can do it. He just doesn't want to.    But on that note, Bush was a druggie himself. So far there is no evidence that Obama supports drug use aside from trying it/doing it in college, but who doesn't do drugs in college or in their teen years? And I'm not defending Obama, don't get me wrong, but I think the whole "war on drugs" attack on marijuana is just silly. Alcohol is far more dangerous.|`|FIXKYCIGaa	There is another expression that goes "ignorance is bliss".    You must be veryy, verry happy.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	And all Bush's brother did was to sit on the board of the company that provided security for the World Trade Center... until just before 9/11.    One of these things is not like the other.|`|N5jBMjrDaa	"George Obama and the president barely know each other, the network reported, noting that George Obama was one of the president's few close relatives who did not go to the inauguration in Washington last week."    It is not Obama's fault that his half-brother that he barely knows got arrested for possession.|`|N6lZqzWOaa	Did you know that El Rushbo was consuming 3000 oxycontin pills a month????? Now.

From some of the answers here, it looks as if some people didn't read the clip.    Justagrandma, I completely agree with you about addiction. People who use addiction as a joke or a pejorative are simply ignorant or in denial about their own addictions.     Unless they are completely without souls, they would NEVER again do that if they had to watch a loved one destroy himself because of addiction, or watch the agony of a parent whose child is an addict. I've seen it.     People who make fun of addiction and addicts are cretins.    It's worth the 10 points for me to say so.|`|8DPRGTvPaa	You cant help someone who doesn't want to be helped. Blood doesn't make him his brother, his brother and father had nothing to do with him while he was growing up, why would anyone expect Obama to now be responsible especially when he is running a country that they are not even citizens in. I think your question would be different if he was helping, probably something more like "why is Obama helping his brother...... and we need help here?". Either way this panned out, you would still have asked a question.
PI8VfiY1aa	Probably not- being able to access someones personal information like that would surely constitute a breach of privacy laws.    Federal Privacy Act of 1974 states that:    "No agency shall disclose any record which is contained in a system of records by any means of communication to any person, or to another agency, except pursuant to a written request by, or with the prior written consent of, the individual to whom the record pertains."

HlYzvJ51aa	They would not give you homicide for a pregnancy 10 weeks along. In order to get homicide the fetus has to be considered viable more like after 25 or so weeks would you get that charge.|`|xqU1N1VBaa	I think it really depends on the crash you cause.     you also have to look at both sides. most pregnant women love their baby before its even born. so having all your hopes and dreams smashed because somebody couldnt handel a car kind of sucks.    a lot of court decisions depend on the victim impact statment.
SjTAVdcKaa	Example? Obama doesn't lead by example.    He tells us tough times are here & he spends money like a drunken sailor.  Remember this quote? We cant drive our SUVs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times . . . and then just expect that other countries are going to say OK. But then he cranks up the White House thermostat to orchid growing levels.   http://michellemalkin.com/2009/01/29/oba...    He was accused of being an elitist snob.

mKIA6V4Saa	Bush = bad  Obama = good|`|q4EXFhV7aa	It's a shame you don't read the news before criticizing someone: http://www.cnn.com/2009/US/weather/01/31...  Ky Governor Beshear praised the Obama administration's prompt reaction to the storm. Obama declared parts of the state a federal disaster area Wednesday evening.    "They really hit the ground running," he said. "They're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need."|`|Q9W7p6Kzaa	I'm smack in middle of this ice storm and it is really bad.

They seem to be still enamored of him. I think that some of them think he is the Messiah.  I just hope the country survives him and his acolytes.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I find comparisons between Katrina and the recent ice storms ridiculous. In Katrina over 1,800 people died and more than 700 are still missing. The count for the current storm is less than 50 and a good chunk of that are those killed in traffic accidents or staying outside too long (rather than the few who have been killed because their power is off). I don't want to minimize their deaths, but the two disasters are completely different.    Now what do you expect Obama to do about people who insist on driving or people who get hypothermia from shoveling their driveways? Maybe he should make everyone in the midwest stay inside until June. Yes, there are deaths from power going down, but seriously, Obama is already giving federal disaster aid to many of these states, it looks like he is responding to the storm, what else do you want him to do? Or are you going to blame him for every car accident or slip and fall throughout the year?|`|Ay5HrCTeaa	No.|`|IDZTtipeaa	I don't know if it is "fairly typical" of his supporters or not.  I can only speak for myself.  Being one his supporters, I would have first asked for a reference for which you make your claim about the comparisons of aid efforts for Katrina vs. the ice storms.  We would then have looked at your source and analyzed the information given.  Who knows where the conversation might have gone from there.  I probably would have also mentioned that the Katrina mess was mishandled by many people, including the director of FEMA and the mayor of New Orleans, most notably.  Bush would only have come in as an afterthought, having been the one who appointed someone grossly incompetent to head FEMA.
AA11702773	No, but if you could get a new credit line, say by mortgaging your children, while you spent that credit line it would FEEL like you had prosperity.    And then the bills, larger bills, would come due.|`|x12mMdApaa	liberal thinking  yes, as long as its not my money you are spending.|`|pnpkJKvpaa	You don't understand the difference between Microeconomics and Macroeconomics, do you?    "We are all Keynesians now." -- Milton Friedman, Nobel-Prize-winning conservative economist. (translation -- "we need to spend a sh*tload of money now to stimulate the economy.")|`|zjpB2GARaa	Of course not.  Despite the delusions of the Keynesians, throwing money down the drain does not create prosperity.  Government can "stimulate" the economy by either taxing people, printing new money, or borrowing money, all 3 of which cause net harm to the economy.|`|gJzEAvNTaa	let me help you out  you have to go into debt to spend it on sound investments  like during the 1930, great depression, some businessmen went into debt, borrowed money and developed aviation and telecommunications. they were rewarded by the foresight and became billionaires    but, if you dig yourself deeper into debt to spend money on bad investments like STD prevention, digital cable, ACORN, then you won't eb prosperous. it will not create long term jobs, in fact, this stimulus is just a handing out money for temporary workers|`|gO1iAm99aa	The same way as if you'd walk into a tavern and buy a round for the house. You'd be temporarily popular, in debt, and as soon as the patrons found out they're paying the bill in triplicate ten years after, a sneaky, two faced, double tongued hack actor/pretender.   No it wont. Not as it is.  A long term business investment yes, a give away no. Depends on what some call an investment, a business, where, and when.  I see little in package  2 of anything immediate, spread throughout the country, or of pertinence to the larger problems currently at hand.    Abracadabra-smoke & mirrors-snake oil salesman-presto change o-witch doctor-voodoo economics.  Again.  Invest it all with Bernie Madoff. I get a good "vibe" from him. After all Rod Blagojevich vouched for him.|`|NkYQXP8Oaa	Depends on what you are spending the money on.

9VaWal2Daa	Must have missed the news today.......care to elaborate?
5syj6Uzaaa	I'll tackle the last part of your question first.  You must always admit the possibility that your views are flawed.  A person who can not perceive that they might be wrong is likely, in my opinion, to be wrong more often than a person who senses his own fallibility.    To address the meat of your question, I have to make some statements about the scope of your terms.  If being "right" means success for the country, then you can not possibly be right while the country goes down in flames.  Perhaps you were right about some things but got others wrong that ruined the country.  Perhaps there were other factors outside of your control.    From your additional details, it is clear that you are addressing the role of the presidency in the welfare of the country.  While the president exerts a great deal of influence, he is by no means alone in determining whether the country prospers.    Now, to plainly answer your question:  If your responsibility is for the welfare of the country, it is your only interest that it succeed.  Even if you happened to be right about something important, you should admit your failure if the country does go down in flames.  From there, we can argue whether you ever had it in your power to save the country and what was your role in the failure.|`|noo8vpvzaa	If you're "right" the country WON'T go down in flames    Obama is wrong    Perhaps liberals and conservatives have a different view of what's right and wrong.|`|Q6ZQlMLpaa	Logical question with a good view.  It is important to be right, but even believing your right, you will find those who objects for what ever reasons.|`|AA12176505	I think the answer to that question resides in what your definition of success is.  I think that the dividing line is in ideals, not politics.|`|ziZQWxi3aa	i found a cool game online    called mcCain vs obama so if you're not satisfied about mccain losing than make him win in this game lol it's actually really hard but fun.    seriously.    http://www.miniclip.com/games/mccain-vs-...|`|cpmiJQyIaa	A political party should never come before country.  A political party can not save a nation, it's people do.  That's why it says in The US Constitution, "We the People...."  It does not say, "We the Republicans...", "We the Democrats....", etc.    This countries greatest achievements have stemmed from the people of this nation, not from a political party.  Our founding fathers put country first.  Amazing how so many have forgotten it.|`|BQY8b2YOaa	First, Caribou, I have been a disabled Veteran in a VA hospital and I want Obama's policies to fail miserably. I do not want my injuries and my buddies injuries as well as some of my friend's deaths to have been for nothing, a losing cause as Obama wants these wars to be. You ever serve 1 day in any of the military branches? I would bet any amount of money you have not.   Now, to descend from my soapbox, I want the country to succeed as all Americans do, no matter your ideology. My views are from my own research and experience. When I put out an answer to someones questions they are my opinions based on facts not just other people's opinions.|`|9FHoZOTGaa	Of Course, I would rather be wrong, have the country succeed dramatically and be faced with the possibility of admitting my views are flawed.  If you don't feel that way your an imbecile.    However, I don't know what "side" you're on, if sides have to be taken.    I did not vote for Obama.  I think the start he is off to is sh*tty.      So I THINK that I am right and the country is going to go down in flames.  But I HOPE that I am wrong and that my views were flawed and the country dramatically succeeds.    Sit back and watch it unfold is all we can do at this point.|`|4e7402a60e9ce953c24acb5439025045aa	Bush will be found to be correct in history, to be a leader you have to lead.  He did , he heard what people said and in his gut he stuck with his plan.  You can't run a company or a country with polls and focus groups.  Did he make good choices all the time?  NO  But I would trust my life with him over this other charactor we have now.  You need a moral compass and a set of beliefs to fall back on, I don't think this new guy has either.  We have the 3rd term of the Clinton administrian.  So much for change|`|cWyQc7T7aa	I would love to be wrong and have my country succeed.  I wanted our previous President to be right so badly.      I can only hope our current President can do better.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	You could write a big book on the mistakes that I've made. No, I would never want the country to go down so I could say i told you so. That would be insane. Now, if you are referring to what the left is taking out of context about what Limbaugh said. I agree with him. I hope obama fails at turning our country in to a socialist country. I'm sorry but, I am not the least bit in love with obama. I don't agree with his politics at all. I'm for less government. The best move that I can think of is to run every lobyist out of the country.|`|bJiE54Qtaa	No one is ever right and wrong in their "predictions".

407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	Well, "News 1130" should know. :)    --------------------    "This is a testament, not just to the size of our trading relationship and the closeness of our alliance, but also the strength of our friendship," Prime Minister Stephen Harper told the House of Commons.    "I look forward to an important and productive working visit."    Harper spoke with Obama over the phone last week and discussed plans for the trip.    "Canada is a vitally important ally," White House spokesperson Robert Gibbs told reporters Wednesday. "The president looks forward to the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Harper and visit our neighbour to the north."     http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/st...|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	Well Bush sold the USA to China to fund the war in Iraq . So it seems like China now thinks they actually do have a say and ownership of the USA. Do they ?  Canada has gone conservative . So who cares .|`|t3QAaSN9aa	Unfortunately, any effort by the Obama administration to protect US jobs by requiring goods and supplies to be manufactured in the US is going to upset foreign countries that supply goods to us.  We have to do what is best for this country but there is no indication that we won't live up to our treaty obligations.  The charge of China's currency manipulation is not new but now it is being expressed a little more bluntly.     Trade policies between nations are understandably a little more tense when the economic situation is very bad and especially when an administration is trying to create and protect US jobs.    Edit:  You are deliberately confusing foreign relations issues in order to criticize President Obama.  Diplomacy in critical areas with hostile countries is not the same as addressing trade issues.|`|q4EXFhV7aa	Um, employing American workers and buying American products and machinery may tick off Canada. I'm perfectly fine with that. We need to put our people to work, regardless of Canada's problems with not getting a piece of the pie.|`|68b7fe8af8ba2cd679ce447ab1965dacaa	If you want the economy to improve you will have to do some things that other countries will not like, ie- not outsourcing jobs.  Basically you will never be happy with anything Obama does.  Good luck with all that negative energy.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	Nothing Obama does will equal the foreign relations mess Bush got us into.  According to polls before the elections people outside the United States overwhelmingly favored Obama over the GOP (including NATO members and Australia, not just the Mid-East) and I doubt that's going to change.  In case you haven't noticed, we have always had disagreements with Canada over trade, that's not going to change believe it or not.  What's simply amazing is that you think there would be any goodwill towards the Republicans and that you think this minor issue is a symbol that the world doesn't like Obama.|`|05anyV31aa	Canada's worthless?

What fantasy planet do you live on where there are never disagreements between countries?|`|LqSciCrhaa	Many foreign leaders see Obama as weak and willing to give in to their demands so they will take advantage now while they can.|`|aiYDXNKuaa	Firstly, Worthless? WTF??? What the hell did we ever do to you??      Secondly, we Canadians love Obama. We're happy George W's "reign of error" is at an end. The rest of the world thinks you guys might have finally grown up. Rather than an ignorant war mongering cowboy, America finally has an intelligent rational leader who is capable of getting the job done. He is improving the American image world wide. According to international polls, he has a 80% popularity rating (CNN).      Thirdly, Canada DOES NOT have a negative effect on the American economy. We export a lot of raw materials, metals, lumber, oil, electricity, agriculture, etc.. Not many American jobs are being outsourced to Canada. We have an identical standard of living (if not better), a dollar that is close in value, and we also have about a million people less than the state of California (about 32 million). We aren't any threat to the American economy. I'd be more concerned about China. Too many American, Canadian & European jobs are outsourced to China and other third world countries. In my opinion, there should be a bill making it illegal to outsource outside of the G8.       And our economy is nowhere near as bad as yours is. Our banks never needed to be bailed out, they were never deregulated, and our economy is far more stable.

Bush and his band of thieves left with their pockets full.      Obama is the first real elected president that we have had since Clinton.  The republicans are the party of corporate welfare...thanks to them Exon reported a record breaking profit.  And you question Obama?

NMaCcyeKaa	What's wrong with Obama being friends a man who has spent most of his life advocating education reform in urban schools?    I think liberals still have grounds to complain.  I don't think any of Obama's past associations indicate that he would put Republicans in his cabinet.|`|MEReSvZeaa	In fact, we predicted during the campaign that Obama would be prone to having a corrupt White House based on past behavior.    He makes no distinction between moral people and criminals.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	Sure we do.

We tried to figure him out the best we could based on his past, his affiliations, his accomplishments...or lack there of, we tried to go by what he himself said, who influenced him...and not much did we see that was good. And when we tried to tell everyone, the left and idiot moderates just wouldn't hear it. They wouldn't admit Obama wasn't fit to even be a president.  So, we have to ask....were they just that stubborn ? That stupid they couldn't see it themselves ? To caught up in the dreams of hope and change ? They are the only one's that can truthfully answer that.  But..considering how they are so easliy deluded by their own sense of self importance, or their hate of the right and Bush or in general their unstable emotional state of lashing out ...even if it is the truth. We can all agree they will always be miserable and whining. But I don't think they have the right.  The truth was out there, and they didn't listen to it.|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	As Americans everyone has grounds to complain about whatever they want.|`|n2kBUWQOaa	Liberals have no right to complain about this guy.

But since we're all nothing but a picture we chose to put here no one knows who we are anyway and there's no point in lying.|`|dncp7sE6aa	Cuz they are posers, who think military life is just like call of duty, blackhawk down, and stripes.....it is not|`|5B5pirFWaa	It is an open site forum, and usually it becomes pretty obvious when they have no clue, because some with a clue completely slams the door on them.    I honestly do have to chuckle at times, like a recent when asking if "smoking is still allowed on Submarines". A few answered "it has not been allowed for years" or something to the effect, from people who would not have any idea of knowing the correct answer (they were woman, no woman on US Submarines), when the actual answer is yes it is allowed.    But I do really hear you at times, when someone asks a question I know the answer but cannot answer it because of the nature of the question (classified) and the answers given a completely hilarious.

Another thing that annoys me are ( even though i might tick off them by saying this but it's the truth ) wives and parents of military members who have never served who lecture and answer questions like they were in the military themselves.     At least do some research about what you are talking about before clicking on answer.    Sorry, but wives do not have the toughest job in any branch of the military.    Those stickers annoy the cr@p out of me.|`|9rhmeb7raa	They are merely the mirror image of those who have never served and all want to be in Army Rangers, Special Forces, Delta Force, Marine Force Recon and Navy SEALS.

s1ZxSkQiaa	You might get deployed. I know people in the guard for 20 years yet to deploy. On the other hand I have been in the guard just over a year and I'm about to ship to the sandbox. If you are just now joining I doubt Iraq will be in your future. Maybe Afghanistan though.    The National Guard will help pay for your college. Talk to your recruiter to see how much. As far as training goes you get the EXACT same training as your full time counterparts. However they will get more hands on experience of the daily life than you.     Talk to a recruiter. They will have much more info on your state's options then we will.    Look into the college first. 2 years college with a guarantee no deployment into current conflicts. Sweet deal if you can work it.|`|wzcvFKKhaa	join the real army its ten times better i loved it|`|3f52d29b3acdfe08f6df1f86ebe1eaa8aa	The National Guard is a reserve program. You won't get a regular pay check except for just the weekend work you do. If you are looking for living expenses and full college benefits I would go active Army, Navy, Marines or even Air Force. However, I do not have a problem with people that want to join the National Guard I do have a problem with the recruiters for the NatGuard. They are slimy and will say anything to get you to join. I'm a navy recruiter and I will support anyone's decision on whatever branch they want to join. I would just be careful before you sign a contract with them. Make sure your job is on your contract. Do not sign one if there is no job specified on it!|`|GxeSTBKkaa	Join the real army where you will get better training and respect from some parts of the world. I love the national guard but they are the red headed step child of the service. You will get deployed and are just better off with being active duty for alot of reasons. I'm sorry life hasn't been to good and i've had my share of problems and went back into the military. This time is for keeps and I just can't see myself being a weekend warrior anymore.|`|6VIFtt0Maa	Check with a guard recruiter.  Some states have the college first program while some don't.  I joined the national guard when I was in highschool and have since spent over 2.5 years on active duty.  So if you seriously want to finish college you should either consider the college first program or hold off joining until your done.|`|hJNwAHccaa	When your semester is complete, you should really consider joining Active Duty instead.  Since you're in college, your mom can't stop you from joining the Army.  You'll get more pay if you join AD vs NG.  Both entities deploy at some point but the up side to it is that you'll still be able to attend an online university even while you're deployed.  The Army will pay 100% of your tuition while on AD and when you get out, you'll still have your MGIB to use for college.  Depending on how much college credit you have, you could come in as a higher rank other than a PVT/E-1.  Deployment is a fact of being in the military and it's bound to happen at some point.
80097225db2be4c7906ee17c2eb49f43aa	Though we elected the first black man into office, I think this has been one of the most prejudiced elections in history. I'm not saying Obama didn't win fair and square or anything like that, but a lot of people on both sides voted because of someone's race, gender, etc. People were voting for Hilary in the primaries simply because she was a woman, and they also voted for Obama in both the primaries and the election because he was black. On the other side, people voted for John McCain because Sarah Palin was a woman, or they voted for him because he was NOT black (you wouldn't believe how many idiots have told me they wouldn't vote for a black man). And then there were even a few people who voted for McCain because he was old. Some people need to understand that someone's race, age, hair color, shoe size, etc. doesn't matter in an election, so that's why I believe this election was filled with prejudice. I voted for McCain, btw.|`|AA11702773	I'm disapointed.  I wanted Ron Paul    I am completely nonplussed by the rest of your question, however.|`|TJ8fgBpWaa	If (M)ann Coulter's brain were as big as that manly Adam's apple, (s)he'd still be a fascist retard crap-spewing buttsniffin' ho. No facts, just hateful opinion, no facts, no truth, just repugnant hate and greed. (M)ann should just admit the truth and wear a pointy white sheet KKK uniform-du-jour while rabidly inflicting that outrageous ranting over the airwaves to her drooling, mouth-breathing sycophants.    Sadly, I saw Lou Dobbs get a 'floater' when Ms/Mr. Coulter was on CNN the other night... I wonder how he feels about a "tranny surprise."    The only thing that disappointed me about the '08 election is that Obama only won 54%-46%. I was hoping that there weren't nearly that many (58 million) cretins in this country that I love and fought for and always will in whatever way possible, because as long as good people remain quiet, evil and ignorance will triumph. Go Obama!  .|`|cQDAt46waa	Ok, wait...your saying there are no black republicans! How uninformed you are....Pig.....|`|q4EXFhV7aa	No, I am happy with the election results. You DO know that white people voted for Obama too, right??|`|aGNjZmyJaa	I'm disappointed in how McCain supporters thought he was different from Bush.|`|JplOzo2Yaa	I wanted to see third party candidates get more votes.  Both the Republicans and Democrats have really gotten our country into a lot of trouble in the past few years.  I don't buy the Democrats' excuse that they were helpless because they were in the minority in Congress.  They consistently gave Bush enough votes to make his agenda look bipartisan.    However, I am glad that we finally have a Black President.  Maybe the next time around, we can get someone female in the Oval Office for the first time!|`|4f9e57dbf0fa6fc41e6fe3e1397aa468aa	Nope.    By the way, your assumption is incorrect.  Obama did not win this election because of the African American vote.  If that were the case, then the southern states, which have a very high population of African Americans would have gone for Obama instead of for McCain.    Try some logic next time.|`|l3moIem5aa	Well I certainly would have liked to see someone like Paul or Barr win, but it's not like I had any expectation of that happening.|`|PJBYzIq6aa	Yeah, but he didn't win in my state: Texas|`|N5jBMjrDaa	No.  I don't think that white people would always vote Republican either. I'm white and I rarely vote Republican. I don't care about anything Anne Coulter says.|`|9kx7KDFLaa	No i am not disappointed at all ,Whites voted for Obama too. matter of fact if it was not for the white vote he probably would not be president.   Lets face it the Amercian people is very smart. Ann Coulter is no fool either she just want to sell books|`|7c5d1a76836b7ed2ed52eb7c751f6331aa	Again, Ann Coulter never states anything in normal fashion. She just goes straight for the juglar. Not good. But, it wouldn't matter if we were 100% white. Society always has it's elite, middle class, poor, oppressed, etc. Groups will always have interests of their own. That's okay, it would be really boring if we all agreed all the time. We'd never learn anything either.|`|KVBTtF9faa	Hmm. Well, I'm white and I never voted republican. (I also did NOT vote Obama!)

qXQa06bAaa	Let me put it this way... If they find out you're an illegal immigrant, they're likely to have you detained and carted away by immigration officials before you can blink.    However, if you entered the country legally, obtained all the correct paperwork (immigration visa, green card, etc).... then if you get ok'ed to become a citizen, you can get pretty much any job you want.|`|AA10709853	no.  only Green Card holders and citizens may enlist.   when they run your file and discover you are illegal they will notify ICE.|`|I8Vv7V9jaa	i doubt it.|`|44UXjyzeaa	Considering they are called "illegal" immigrants, I highly doubt it they are going to get a government job.

However if it turned into more than kissing, then that is a different story.|`|meLGAZLcaa	Yes, I think it's legal if you're 16.|`|9u74rP70aa	15 illegal, 16 ok|`|ESKslyfsaa	Kissing would be fine.|`|AA12370221	kissing is fine, assuming the 15 year old is happy with it|`|ExQC8PuDaa	yes, it would class you as a paedophile and get you on a sex offender register if you were reported  16 year old is fine,|`|jV99kgWbaa	In England the age of consent is 16, and a girl can be legally married at that age.    It would therefore be perfectly legal to kiss if the girl were 16 and the boy were 18 in ordinary circumstances, but --     It would not be legal for a person to engage in sexual activity with an individual under the age of 18 if they are in a position of trust in relation to that individual (teacher, warder, care giver, guardian, etc).     It would also not be very moral, in my opinion, if there were a big age gap between the two, for example a 30 year old with a 16 year old.       In England, it is an offence to intentionally engage in sexual touching with a young person who is 15.   Touching covers all physical contact.

He did vote 3 times against the Born Alive Protection Act, which means that he supported the Infanticide that was going on 3 times.

KQL3tqS7aa	You would need to speak to an Army recruiter to get the specifics of this answer.  There are several different waivers and loopholes that they can go through to get someone in.  Time wise, it all depends on how long it takes to get approved/disapproved and if you need to provide supplemental documentation for them.|`|AA10057599	1. most likely permanately DQ'd  2.  6 month wait to try again and will require a waiver, also will not qualify for anything medical  3.  will require a moral waiver, will not qualify for anything that requires a sceurity clearance.|`|deSPSL46aa	1. Depends on the back problem. You will be sent to a specialist after MEPS, and they'll decide if it can be waived or not. Not sure how long it takes.    2. You can get a waiver for this, but failing a drug test at MEPS can make it all but impossible to get a security clearance, because somewhere down the line, you lied to get to MEPS with drugs still in your system. My army liason says that to get this waived, you take another drug test in over 45 days, and it can take anywhere between 6 months to a year for the waiver to clear.    3. Probably not, but I'm not sure. It's considered a moral disqualification, and that's a wide range of stuff.
hJNwAHccaa	I'm going to say this and to me it's probably the harshest thing that I've ever really said on these boards...    You really need to grow up and become more independent instead of dependent.  You seem like you're too needy and if that's the case, you won't survive your relationship because...well let's just face it...when he comes back and y'all get married and all the other bs, there's still going to be times when you won't see him.  I can see right now that you'll be one of those type spouses that I hate to deal with...the ones that always say "why does my husband have to go do this" or "why can't someone else pull his duty so he can come home."  You need to get over being dependent because if you're going to become an Army spouse, you need to learn how to be a strong, independent woman...able to take care of herself and her family while he is away so that he won't have to worry about you and his mission.    I really don't mean to sound so harsh but what I say is the truth.  Anyone else who is soft-hearted can disagree with me but it takes a strong woman to love someone who is in the military, especially nowadays.  You should give your BF all the love and support that he needs.  Just because he leaves doesn't mean that anything changes.  You'll have times that you'll be able to talk with him and when he's in AIT, he can take a pass on a 4-day weekend and come home to see you.  It's tough but many others before you have survived so you'll make it.  You just have to learn to be strong and be supportive because if you're not, you could possibly distance your relationship even more.|`|KQL3tqS7aa	Just try to understand why he wants to do it.  It's a very big thing he is doing and having your support I'm sure means the world to him.  Reassure him that you are behind him and are proud of him.  It's hard to really realize it's happening until he's already gone, and although adjusting may be hard, you'll once again be able to see him soon enough.  Express your feelings and let him know that it's going to be hard on you while he's gone, but tell him you'll be waiting excitedly to see him.|`|Q5J8CggVaa	When you love someone its always going to be hard to be apart for long periods of time. For example my fiance is in the Air Force and they sent him to Korea for a year. But I've looked on yahoo groups and found other military spouses, girlfriends and family members to have as a support system. You just need to stay busy and cherish any communication you have with each other. You won't always hear from them everyday or even weeks at a time. Just keep your head up and stay strong.|`|cJ4EGdwWaa	He is choosing a very honorable path, if you love him do not let him forget that. Letters letters letters. If the time apart makes you change your mind about how you feel, do not hide it from him or just drop contact. You will be his main source of inspiration and courage during what is likely the toughest thing he has ever done.|`|j1rqxELEaa	It's not easy. My boyfriend and I had been together almost a month when he told me he was going to MEPS to take his ASVAB and sign his papers. I was upset that he was going cause we were really close and I was afraid things were going to change. It has actually helped. So give it time and just realize he will be gone one weekend a month for drill. The other thing is if you can go to a drill and see what they do it helps make it easier. What is he going to be gone for nine months for? He has to go to basic training which about ten weeks and AIT is 8 weeks but its not 9 months unless he is going into active duty.|`|941bdc645ba35ed9c1988fbce6d2ace8aa	I am going to be honest with you.    If you feel that you are not going to be able to handle separations you really need to think , i mean really think about your relationship with your boyfriend.    This is just basic training. How are you going to handle if he deployed ot Iraq for 15 months or more? Since it's is highly likely that he will be deployed soon after his MOS school ( army AIT ) and depending on what his job is.    His job is going to be 1st before anything and anybody. You, his family or any children he has in the future. This is something you really need to think about.    You have to learn how to keep yourself busy. Get job, volunteer, anything to help pass by the time. You cannot sit by the phone or mailbox waiting for phone calls or letters. He is busy and you should be too. I am not telling you not to miss him. Everybody misses their sig. other when he or she is gone but strength is shown especially during ones absence.  And absence makes the heart grow stronger in most cases.    Your boyfriend is making a responsible and mature choice in his life.     You cannot have any doubt if you want your relationship to survive this.|`|LWzrCu5caa	Get a grip.   You have snail mail,  phones,  text messaging and internet access.

What you need to do is to keep in touch with him on a regular basis and occupy yourself very much so that you could focus on other things.   Make sure he knows you love him and you are willing to tolerate his military lifestyle. When you talk on the phone, never ask him about his duties, talk about something personal, never the military. My husband is on a 15-month tour in Iraq and I've been doing fine because I keep myself busy. I would go crazy if I didn't do something everytime. You need to be psychologically ready for this.|`|b82ybE3gaa	You just have to realize that he wants to help his country, earn a career, make a steady paycheck (whatever his reasons are) and you have to stick by his side. being a military girlfriend/wife is one of the hardest things in life to do if you really love the man your with. And it takes a strong woman to handle it. Just breathe and tell him how proud you are. you can handle this. =)|`|XNFvoIGxaa	If you love him then 9 months is a needle in a haystack. Stand by your man if you love him. It is a good test on how strong a relationship is. Depending on where in the army he goes, he will learn skills that can be passed on to post army life. Also, there's nothing like  bit of military training to set a person straight. You come out with a clear head and a sense of purpose. Apart from the fact that they might wake up dead, there's no reason why someone shouldnt give it a go. Just think, if you stick by him then you may have a life time to spend together. I know a few Australian soldiers who went to war. One went in with the first battalion to go to Vietnam. He was actually in the first platoon that went on patrol from Australia there. He is still married to his wife from then. Another met his wife and married her all in the month before he went to Korea. They were happily married till the day he died. The point is, if he's the right one then if you stick by, you'll have a brighter future after than if he didnt join.

The rest of the service academies are all in the top 20.    Additionally, you need to get yourself involved in things like athletics, student body government, community service, etc....  Take LEADERSHIP positions (Captain of the Chess Team, Captain of the Debate Team, Editor of the school newspaper, Head of yearbook committee, Eagle Scout, etc...) whenever possible.  Make yourself stand out from the group.    Take Honors/AP classes whenever possible.    Seek out former naval officers in your community, preferably ones who attended the academy.  For instance, you might find one who attends your church.

esOaJoqBaa	If you are looking for this knowledge in order to help you when you join the military I would tell you to stop. The military has a very specific way to do things, and each individual unit does things differently, training in those things now will only inhibit your necessary unit training later.   Learning languages is defiantly possible, and very useful for many aspects of life, so go for it.   If you want to train with firearms start by learning to use them safely and then begin on the basics of good marksmanship. Those things apply in all sorts of military training, from cqb to heavy machine guns. You must master the basics first.|`|cEFiOrX5aa	Uh... nomad, it is not wrongful to restrict certain things to mature people who can be trusted with such important things as.... ohhhh I don't know.... flying a plane and shooting a weapon?|`|x9oCHEtkaa	It's absolutely possible, but all of this seems a little odd.

yR75rXThaa	Depends what really interests you- DHS is pretty big. You say school- are you going through ROTC or planning on enlisting? If you're in ROTC your branch choice isn't guaranteed, but no matter what you pick you'll get some good experience and leadership training.    The MPs will give you the police training    Infantry will give you some leader training but from what I've seen it doesn't always translate as well to the private sector.    Military intelligence has great crossover to those, but it's hard to get into. You may have to do a 2-year "branch detail" with someone like the chemical corps, but you'll be in MI from then on out.    Civil affairs branch may have some interesting stuff as well, depending on your interests. They deal with the local populations and stuff- may translate well to government-civil sector interaction jobs.    http://www.goarmy.com/RotcViewCareers.do|`|dSbAz63baa	Dude, go Infantry, Excel and become a Ranger.

7Rk5aUcvaa	1.What the American colonists did to the Native Americans when they arrived here was comparable, if not worse than what happened during the Holocaust. They killed, pillaged, and destroyed their people, their communities, and their culture. They gave them diseases, destroyed their land and their way of life, and made whoever they didn't kill move out of the way. Now we have reservations and casinos to make up for it? It was a disgusting and barbaric episode in America's history. We essentially almost wiped out an entire race of people who lived here peacefully before we got here.     2.Americans imported people from Africa to serve as their personal slaves, and treated them as property; buying, selling, beating, and killing these people as they saw fit. After slavery ended, black Americans weren't treated as real people until well after the civil rights movement, and to a degree, prejudice and mistreatment of black people is still a problem.    3. Women also still don't have equal rights in this country. They aren't paid the same amount for the same jobs men do, and weren't able to vote until the 20th century. It also took a long time for it to be acceptable for women to have jobs, go to college, etc.     4. After the World Trade Center attacks, anyone in America who was Muslim, or appeared to be Middle Eastern were given a hard time by some citizens. Many people were harassed, beaten, and sometimes killed because they were Middle Eastern or Muslim. A friend of mine from Pakistan was harassed and even had things thrown at her in her high school after the 9/11 attacks.    That's all I can think of at the moment. Now I'm depressed... ha.

TM2yK8nQaa	The first thing she needs to do, after reporting it to the police, is to IMMEDIATELY cancel all cards.  This is why it is a good idea to periodically take all ID's and credit cards out of your wallet and xerox them, so you know who you have to contact.  She should also change all her locks (I hope her keys weren't in the purse) because the thief, and anyone he sells the information to will know where she lives, and with whom.  She needs to subscribe to a group like LifeLock also, which will protect her identity and her credit.....they guarantee their work. The cell phone needs to be cancelled, as it can be sold to persons who intend to commit acts of terror....they are always looking for "clean" phones.

EuGsGfuJaa	All licensed firearm dealers have all the paperwork you need, and they are more than happy to explain everything that is needed.    A background check and waiting period is required to purchase a handgun.  This is typical of most states.    Maryland has concealed carry permits, but they are known throughout the United States as one of the hardest places to obtain one, as the State Police can turn you down without cause, and usually do.    However, if all you want to do is keep it at home and take it to the range, that's fine.  While it is illegal to wear the gun on your person (concealed or not) it i perfectly legal to carry it inside a pistol case, especially if it's locked.  It must be enclosed in this manner, (and unloaded) when transporting in a car.  This is good gun safety anyway.|`|AA10465540	Fill out the application and go to a gun store.

Jobs most likely to end up in deployments are operational jobs...security forces, transportation, logistics, construction, special forces, etc.  But yes, many reservists and guards do their "one weekend a month and two weeks a year" for 20 years.

As far as your job goes, I know in the Navy at least, the scores of the certain sections are counted for rates (jobs).  For example, if you want an administrative rate, you would need to score a certain amount in the sections applicable to administrative work.

Obviously in a number of the oil producing nations in the middle east there is a very powerful elite class with a huge share of the wealth compared to the rest of society. And whilst your point about TAX equality is fair, the Islamic system is in many social respects unfair.     The Capitalist system is a flawed system. Whilst it appears to offer freedom and equality and choice, in reality it manipulates our desires our view of the world and subjegates us to the meaningless pattern of consumersim. Capitalism has become elaborate and subtle system of control.   The Islamic system is a less subtle form of control, the subjegation of the people to a system of common law that derives its core precepts from a religious text. Being a non-believer I feel this to be problematic as religious texts by their very nature discriminate against many social groups.   It was the case through the 70's and early 80's that hardline Islamism as state ideology was rejected by many societies in the Islamic world. Notably in Algeria and Egypt, the Islamist revolution inspired by Qutb and later Zawahiri, failed to gain mass support.    I don't believe that Capitalism or Islanism represent the triumph of the human imagination or the human intellect. Under Capitalism we become isolated cynical beings, under Sharia we become            male-centric homophobes.  Neither is ideal.    The idea of a universal TAX rate is all well and good but it is less fair than it actually seems. There are always going to be people who are wealthier than others, certainly in our time, and a truly fair tax system would be proportionate to income. A very high rate for the very wealthy and a near zero rate for the very poor.  My view is that everyone should contribute something to the public services but that the very wealthy should contribute much more than they are asked to currently and the very poor should contribute very little so as to increase their prospects of saving more money.    Following on from that, Capitalism needs to do away with some of its dreadful practices, the kind of thing that has brought the economy to its knees. The markets need stronger regulation by western governments so that billions isn't wasted on toxic loans, speculation or dangerous derivatives.     The main cruelty in Capitalism over the last 25 years is that everyone has been encouraged to spend spend spend and not save. Our hunger for credit must end, we must live more realistically, that means buy what you can actually pay for.     One day we'll get there, one day we'll find the system. Democracy is the starting point.... but it doesn't work yet.

yR75rXThaa	The Green to Gold may be best depending on how fast you're pushing through the credit hours. Most bachelor's degrees need about 120 credits, right? Well, if you'll get your degree in the next year and a half when your two year requirement is up, no need to do the ROTC- 10 weeks of OCS and you're on the move.    Green to Gold I think is a better option since it gives you a break. We're deploying so much that you have to take it where you can get it! Plus, locking into a ROTC program makes it hard for people to brush you off and delay your OCS service. Not to mention you get some good leadership training and you'll be looked up to as one of the very few in the program with active duty experience.    Furthermore, how much leadership training can you really get in a short period? OCS is only a few months long as opposed to a year or two in school depending on what transfers over. Plus, OCS is very infantry-based and it's TRADOC... and believe me you've probably dealt with that enough. Green to Gold would be awesome. Contact a college you're interested in and find out what the requirements are.
HGIuXxnRaa	No, it isn't right. There is a reason why being 15 is still considered a minor. He is taking a parents right away from them.

A teen pregnancy would definitely be considered one of the certain circumstances.<br>  <br>  Now, keep in mind that this is my hypothetical daughter that I love and care about deeply. She is in the other state on the operating table, knocked out and ready to undergo the operation. I storm in and demand that the abortion be stopped. First of all, my daughter should have the right to an abortion, regardless of whether she has my consent or not. If 15 is old enough to have a job, pay an income tax on it, drive, and have sex, then it's old enough to make decisions regarding her own health.<br>  <br>  Second, I will say again that this is my daughter who I love and care about deeply. She comes up to me and admits that she doesn't know what to do, and that she wants an abortion. Now, personally I am opposed to abortion and find it morally wrong. However, I believe that the individual's intentions must be respected. <br>  <br>  Daughter of Mine, if you want an abortion, then I can't (or at least shouldn't be able to) stop you- but don't expect me to give you any support or consolation in the situation. You made that decision and you're gonna have to learn to live with it.<br>  <br>  Of course people should be able to get an abortion under these circumstances. Now, I'm not talking about a financially stable couple in their late 20's to early 30's wanting an abortion for no reason- THAT's wrong. I'm talking about a 15-year old whose life could be ruined by a pregnancy.<br>  <br>  <br>  To answer your question: Yes, that's right.<br>  |`|P9zMowzTaa	I would hope that:<br>  <br>  1. My daughter received adequate education about condoms from both myself and from her health class<br>  <br>  2. We were on good enough terms that she would tell me about her pregnancy<br>  <br>  3. That if she did choose an abortion, she would be able to live with her decision.<br>  <br>  And if she DID decide to drive across state lines, she would be grounded of course for driving somewhere without telling me where she was going, but when she gets to the clinic, I would pray that the person doing the abortion was a licenced docter, and not just some back-alley person with a coat hanger<br>  <br>  Because by outlawing abortion, my daughter would probably get one anyways, but instead of driving across state lines to a clinic, she would go to someones house and let an unlicensed person shove something up her.<br>  <br>  I would want what is best for my daughter, and a back-alley abortion is NOT what is best for her.|`|bvTJ4tnOaa	I just saw the most ridiculous commericial ever. A freaky doll poops in a toilet and there is actually a little, brown, plastic turd you flush in her little toilet. Back to your question...<br>  <br>  Since everyone has different opinions, if my daughter got pregant at the age of 15, I would tell her that it is her choice, and although I may not like the choice she chooses, she will still have my support. (I am Pro-Life). Obama voted NO on notifying parents if their daughter has gone out of state to get an abortion. I disagree. I believe that parents should be informed when an infant is suddenly extracted from their daughter's uterus hours away. That's just me though.|`|1f9ae62867e615825fab65d29d47f217aa	Here's a breathtakingly logical idea.<br>  <br>  Why not have congress write an actual Law, granting the right to an abortion so this is no longer an issue?<br>  <br>  I will tell you why.<br>  <br>  If they do this, such a law would have a few challenges:<br>  <br>  Both houses have to pass it and the president must sign it, not easy.<br>  <br>  Such a law has to grant equal protection to fathers under the law and possibly even unborn children or the Supreme Court might strike it down and at the same time end Roe v. Wade. by defacto case law.<br>  <br>  The politicians don't want a solution, they want the issue so they can run on it, both parties.<br>  <br>  Wake up people.<br>  <br>  Edit: My daughters are 10 and 8.|`|1kkcvZLRaa	maybe that 15 year old shouldnt have made that mistake in the first place!<br>  <br>  if the girl wasnt a slut..she wouldnt have to have that problem now would she?<br>  <br>  i only agree with abortion, for victims of sexual crimes, and those whose health is at risk.<br>  <br>  if someone gets pregnant its no ones fault but their own..and if there stupid enough to get an illegal procedure done..or travel on there own, that is their own stupid mistake. people need to own up to their own mistakes.<br>  <br>  and i encourage those of you who support abortion to look up how they do the procedures, and watch videos of them. |`|12c6cce6cfd314ae47979facba5d116aaa	I would want my daughter to feel comfortable enough to tell me, and I'm a mother who will always love my children, no matter what. <br>  Life isn't like that for all children. They deserve the right to escape their parents' vengeance, or physical abuse, or forced pregnancy.<br>  The child, in this case, has rights. Parents don't own children.<br>  Darn straight it's right. |`|ZcaC37sZaa	No it is not right, it is part of the socialist agenda to let the government raise the children not the parents, I would want to know so I could offer help and let her know aborion is not an acceptable solution and their are others.|`|qo2u1BCoaa	yes. it is her right as an American citizen per The Supreme Court decision named "Roe vs. Wade". it is her body. not anyone else's. maybe you could ask if you could drive along with her for support?|`|XJigtEiKaa	Well if your daughter who you supposedly love so much is afraid to tell you she is pregnant, then I would suggest you haven't done a very good job of parenting.|`|YVFSX9xKaa	Well, if your daughter is getting pregnant at 15, then you're just a bad parent.  That's not Obama's or anybody else's fault.<br>  <br>  <br>  |`|CSbSQfYHaa	That's a false choice.  I would help assist her by helping her find a suitable place to get an abortion.<br>  <br>  Can we address the issues with reason instead of asking melodramatic questions?|`|dyvfTOTYaa	Well maybe if you were not such a psychotic overbearing parent who would damn her to hell and lock her in a closet she would be able to confide things in you.|`|9Izy4meLaa	Or would you rather see her go into a back alley and pay some guy who's not a doctor $1000 to to take care of her in his basement?|`|60x7RSebaa	I will be furious if this law gets enacted. I am responsible for the health and wellness of my daughter until she is 18. No, it is not right!|`|WC2GYINbaa	the problem with parental consent is in cases if incest or abuse. It is to protect a child|`|9hBrvHScaa	Yes.|`|9Z1d0i6faa	Can a 15 year old do the following by themselves?<br>  <br>  Living alone?  no-not without consent<br>  working full time? no-not without consent<br>  buy a house? no<br>  rent a house? no<br>  buy a car? no<br>  rent a car? no<br>  get into an R rated movie? no<br>  buy cigs? no<br>  vote? no<br>  <br>  and the list goes on and on...<br>  <br>  if my daughter can't get into an R rated movie by herself, why should she be able to get an abortion by herself?  I wonder what happens if the 15 year old goes in for an abortion and something goes wrong medically, who do they call then for consent for the extra surgery necessary to try to fix what they have messed up?  If they don't need a parents consent, then will I have to pay for that bill since I didn't give my permission for the abortion to start with.  I don't think they could legally bill a 15 year old for a hospital stay (at least they can't around here), so does the state pick up that expense?  should we just send the bill to Obama himself and the others that voted in favor of this?  <br>  <br>  This is messed up in more ways than one.<br>  <br>  AGENT 007 "That leaves two options: terminate the pregnancy, or put the baby up for adoption."  What about the third option?  you know the one where the mother who loves and cares for her daughter deeply offers to help her 15 year old raise the baby until she is ready to do it, or offers to completely raise the baby and lets the 15 year old life her life like she normally would?  I love my daughter enough to raise her baby until she was able to do it or to raise her baby until it was an adult.  This way her life is NOT negatively effected by the baby, nor does she have to live with the fact that she had an abortion.|`|jxLWwMBXaa	I wouldn't want my daughter to ever feel that she couldn't trust me enough to tell me about the pregnancy. At 15, she would already know that of that were to happen, that she could trust me and that I would be willing to help her take care of the baby. My kids would never have to feel alone and afraid.<br>  <br>  I have always been against abortion, and I really hope kids will not abuse of this "right" if it comes to this. It's wrong and horrible to think it's legal.|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	As opposed to a daughter I hate and wish had never been born???  C'mon, sweetie, get real.<br>  <br>  I would hope that she would come to me and  that I took her in for the procedure, but if that were not the case, I know that she would be with a good, supportive friend.  I've raised her to trust her judgement.|`|iEqp1qICaa	Not at 15, duh!  18 yes.  As  her mother would you let her get an abortion if she were raped?  McCain has voted for no abortion unless the mother would die otherwise.  I'd rather die than never be able to let go of a rape!|`|ruDJngT0aa	Well, I have to say I would support it more than my fifteen year old daughter being violently raped and then forced by law to carry the baby to term. Maybe that's just me, though. |`|b1LTxSKwaa	If your daughter is too afraid to tell you about her situation without you judging her for wanting to having an abortion then I think you have more important issues to work out|`|89e0c1de65541f968ea18e0756f6ee60aa	No.  It is just another case of Democrats driving a wedge between people and groups.<br>  <br>  You from your family, whites from blacks, women from men, rich from poor. Division has been their most effective ploy.|`|oTmc3kMUaa	So has McCain|`|q4EXFhV7aa	If you truly love and support your daughter, she should be able to come to you and talk to you about her plans. Besides, this is a FAR better solution than McCain/Palin, who think she shouldn't be allowed to have an abortion and should, instead, recieve counseling....even if her father is the one who made her pregnant. Perhaps that is EXACTLY why parental consent isn't always the best idea. Sometimes it is the parents who are the problem. If you are a good mommy, your daughter will come to you regardless.|`|cWyQc7T7aa	If my daughter had done that at 15, I would sit down and talk to her about it but ultimately, since I cannot be around her 24-7, it would be her choice and I would much rather her go into a safe environment and get it done than a back alley with a rusted coat hanger.|`|0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	It is my understanding that Sen. Obama does approve of the law that makes that statement. I believe that as long as a youngster is under the age of adulthood....i.e. 18, parents have the right to know what is going on in her life. Not only on this issue but also regarding any other things that are going on. As a parent, that is my right.<br>  <br>  I understand what people mean by pro choice....but they fail to understand the wedge that the "parents need not know" part of it would drive between family members. I can't imagine any parent being so callous that they would not want to know. Some would probably get pretty ticked off...but that is the way of things sometimes. Even if eventually the abortion law is overturned, I would very much like to see a much stronger availability of other counseling and assistance programs as John McCain wants also. Sometimes these kids just don't see any other out.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	She should be able to get the abortion in her own town.<br>  <br>  I think Palin should be raped by a family member so that she can prove to the public how noble it is to keep the baby and not have an abortion.|`|fL0wHyNNaa	If there is so much love between parent and child, she wouldn't feel the need to run off to have it done. It's only when parents would freak out and make her have the child that it's necessary.|`|xZ1GD4zbaa	He wants to reward irresponsibility with more irresponsibility.<br>  <br>     
GWz5KDTwaa	Pro-lifers never support anything that would raise their taxes.  They especially couldn't care less for what happens to all the precious unwanted fetuses when they are finally born.  As long as the mother is forced to carry to term, the kids can then rot in hell, their job is done.|`|wtcAK31Paa	Republicans dont care. They just want the baby born and then they dont want to hear about it or see it again. AND its funny how they are talking bad about the mother of octuplets, saying she'll be on welfare. Yet they would oppose her having an abortion.|`|52bfba7833ff67fedabdba05216f5314aa	The last thing I want is the government in charge of my health care.

While at the same time taking away most of the benefits that would help that life through it's rocky beginnings?    Which girl is most likely to seek an abortion: One that knows she'll get no help with feeding herself or her baby, will get no help on getting a roof over her head and her baby's; will get no help on putting her baby in daycare so she can go study or work to better her life and her baby's, will get no help going back to school so that she can get herself out of the hole and not be a burden anymore.    Or one that knows she'll get all this?    It's in every body's best interest to help these women and their kids because you want these kids to become your next mechanic, doctor, teacher, banker etc. and not your next rober, dealer, rapist or murderer.    People if you are pro-life but do not support universal healthcare you have a serious case of Hypocresy and "having your cake and eating it too".     WHY should it be the role of the government to force people to have children they don't want , why should the government forbid abortion and then on the other hand it should NOT be the government's role to at least help support the life they forced someone to bring. Nobody forces anybody to abort. Yet the government can force you to bring a pregnancy to term? how do you reconcile that. Again be consistent!|`|tBXn97NNaa	Well, that describes conservatives perfectly: hypocritical|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	Only Welfare Democrats support Universal Health Care.|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	It would be, and it's even funnier when Pro-Lifers are also Pro-War.|`|60YMS1xkaa	I wonder how many of them adopt as well.

Last time I checked, universal health care wasn't discussed as an option in this country.  That wasn't Barack Obama's proposal.  He wants to give Americans the option of having the same type of insurance our elected officials enjoy.      Where did you get the idea it was universal health care?|`|KrrXT6ocaa	what is hypocritical is that while abortion is legal, we still have to pay for people that have children that cannot afford them.|`|BQ4M9ODnaa	Two completely separate, unrelated political issues|`|x5RFgh6Qaa	I don't, competition is in the best interest for everyone. no I don't see how that could be hypocritical at all. what needs work is the insurance industry, but for the gov't to control it?

I would be forced to pay the consequences for their choices and they would be held blameless.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	I've gone back and forth on this most of my life, and finally decided to look at the death penalty system in action.  A lot of what I found surprised and disturbed me.  Sources below.    The most disturbing thing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, cant guarantee we wont execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.    A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison, and it is well documented. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.    Families of murder victims are far from unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who have supported the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.     Other important facts:   Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty.     The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. Homicide rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that dont.    There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.    The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?    Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.    Sources:    Death Penalty Information Center, www.deathpenaltyinfo.org,  for stats on executions, reports on costs, deterrence studies, links to FBI crime stats and links to testimony (at state legislatures) of victims' family members.

State sanctioned murder does not make a wrong right.  This goes for abortion too.  If the death sentence is ok, because it's against the weakest (the unborn, the terminally ill, the handicapped) or the worst of us (criminals), then its not much more of a leap to use it for political/religious crimes as is done in China and Saudi Arabia.  Either all life is to be protected, or what is the point?  Criminals need to be incarcerated for life for our own protection-but I will not judge when they should die.|`|t0mb150gaa	Yes, i believe there are certain crimes that should be punishable by the death penalty(examples..mass murders,child killers,child molesters,etc). The pros to it are that we would not have over populated jails that we as tax payers pay for these people to live in and if people knew there were tougher penalties it may make them think twice about committing the crimes. The only con i can think of is if an innocent person is convicted.|`|MEReSvZeaa	If you let a murderer go, you automatically impose the death penalty on a random innocent civilian.    Either way, there will always be a death penalty.  The trick is to impose it on the criminal and not the general public.|`|UXc6lMZBaa	Do I believe in the death penalty?  Do you believe that it is government's job to kill people who live on its land?|`|FY17j1Ajaa	Of a sort. The convicted can have a choice: the remainder of the life at labor for the public good (ex: road construction) or executed immediately so not to cost the taxpayer more money to keep them alive. If a convict tries to escape, they will be immediately executed. If it turns out that the person was judged in error, there isn't that irrevocable step of execution.|`|bIOf9lv7aa	Yes and there are no negatives..An eye for an eye...|`|B6c7BeDnaa	yep,i sure do.|`|UAHjJpC0aa	I do not like the death penalty  but in a few "extreme" cases    where the evidence is OVERWHELMING  and the criminal is found to be a continued threat,  or multiple murders etc,    yes, it is right|`|rkRIYxi2aa	I used to, but now I do not, for two reasons.    1.  DNA testing has shown that an alarming number of people have been wrongly convicted.  I used to think it was otherwise, but I was wrong.    2.  Even if the murderer was correctly convicted, the appeals process is so lengthy, (and incredibly expensive), that he or she is likely to die of old age on death row.    So now I believe that we should incarcerate murderers rather than executing them.|`|BsyC4gevaa	Do not believe in it.|`|2c3rcQRbaa	Pros  - Put some POS in the ground where he belongs.  Cons - Hmmm..........I'll get back to you on that one.|`|4TgxrCX4aa	I'm against the death penalty for two main reasons:    1. There are innocent people condemned to death, yes death row inmates have been proven innocent.  You can release someone from jail, but you can't bring them back to life.    2. Carrying out the death penalty actually costs more than life imprisonment due to specialized facilities and greater legal work.  For simple economic reasons it's better to sentence someone to life in prison than death, I think the two are comparable punishments as both keep the inmate off the streets forever.|`|meVH73dOaa	Yes, sure do.|`|VXk8EZoHaa	YEAH FOR MINORITIES|`|2bx5l56caa	Not unless we're absolutely certain the committed the crime (which we in most cases, cannot verify). There was a study done on death row inmates and actually the majority of them were found innocent of their alleged crimes.     I say lock them up, believe it or not its more expensive to execute someone than hold them|`|gYNDNXAkaa	No, I don't.    State mandated murder is still murder.  You can't bring a person back by killing another, it is just to sate blood lust we have in our society.    Then you realize that there are several cases where people were found innocent after they were executed.    It is barbaric.|`|XPSIn3wxaa	Yes but it only would work if it was done differently.    The courts would have to take the person right from the Court House and hang then, shoot them or electrocute them in the public square right after court.    The general public have to really fear the consequences of their bad actions. The sanitized way it is done now and the ten year wait does nothing except feed hungry lawyers.|`|2NjUK2kRaa	no first of all because I believe no one has the right to take a life, and who's to say that person deserves to die, but God if they did the crime let them rot in prison. The pros are less money used on them, but I still don't see that as an excuse, and do you know about all the cases were people were found innocent after they were killed, just because the state does it doesn't mean its justified|`|4c27e28063700a3960fa200986703581aa	Some people deserve it.  Yes i am for it.  Mainly for 1st degree murder, crimes against kids or handicapped or elderly.  Drug dealers, hmm, on a second arrest.  Rapist, no, just "fix" them and put them in General population ( they will see how it feels then)    I DO think that Hard labor should be brought back, and no TVs n such in Prison.  It should be a place of hell.|`|KVBTtF9faa	No.     First of all, an eye for an eye leaves the whole world blind as my husband loves to  tell me.     Secondly,I believe letting them die and escape life in prison is giving them the easy way out. I think people who have committed acts so heinous as to warrant them a seat on "death row" should be forced to suffer their lives in a tiny little cell block and have to live with their guilt and know that they will never see the outside world, never eat at their favorite restaurant, never make love to their spouse (if they have one) or even have sex again, never be able to enjoy their hobbies that they once loved, etc. And they should just have to sit there and suffer. Suffer and be miserable.    That said, I don't think prisoners should be able to have access to gyms, television, internet, conjugal visits, etc. I  think they should have to dig ditches or do whatever it is they do for prison work on chain gangs out in the hot sun, and even if they "find god" and repent for what they did, I don't think it should grant them a free pass...
425ca8dc150991adaf3ef229478796cdaa	That approach is actual policy in every Catholic hospital (which is ~1/4 -1/2 of all U.S. hospitals). If there is something wrong with a fetus such that it cannot survive and threatens the mother's life (infection, blood poisoning, etc.), then the doctors are still forced to wait until the infection has taken hold and her life is in danger. Only then can they abort the fetus.<br>  <br>  It is also conventional policy throughout the U.S. healthcare system that, when it comes to reproductive issues, doctors and nurses may legally withhold information from their patients (i.e. emergency contraception after a rape) if its use goes against their own religious beliefs.<br>  <br>  It's bad enough when McCain spouts that sort of nonsense from a podium.

His response was "**** you, c-nt!" He still uses that word to refer to his own wife. Links for everything are below in order<br>  <br>  1. He opposes birth control.<br>  2. Despite lying last night and saying he wants states to decide on abortion because he is a federalist, he in fact supports a Constitutional amendment to ban abortion.<br>  3. McCain tells rape jokes.<br>  4. He called his wife a c-nt.<br>  5. McCain opposes equal pay for women.<br>  6. He thought it good fun to suggest his wife enter a topless and bottomless biker babe contest.<br>  8. He divorced his first bathing suit model wife when she was disfigured in a car wreck.<br>  9. He can't answer a simple question about women's health care coverage.<br>  10. He's never co-sponsored any legislation designed to reduce or help prevent unwanted pregnancies<br>  |`|2RzEaod9aa	It could be him simply saying that "health" may be relative, and if someone claims "I'm not able to carry the baby to term" as a reason to get a partial-birth abortion, you can't argue that...even if it's not true. <br>  <br>  It's not like this isn't something done by every politician. Remember Obama's negative stereotyping of the people of rural PA? It's just politics. <br>  <br>  P.S. Nice to see someone use "flippancy." |`|mSFjbetxaa	McSame used the phrase "pro-abortion" because he must be an idiot.<br>  <br>  Most pro-choice people are not in favor of abortion, they are in favor of not telling someone else what to do.|`|a457e9a42af7d95c857ddbcfefd4f337aa	I was really annoyed with a lot of the facial expressions he made throughout the debate.

Gee. I wonder why.<br>  <br>  Frankly I'm surprised any woman would vote for someone who cares so little for us. Unless it's the martyrdom thing.|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	Exactly.  <br>  <br>  NO ONE, I repeat NO ONE is pro-abortion.  I am old enough to have known someone who came close to dying due to an illegal abortion.  <br>  <br>  The whole issue of late-term abortion is basically made up.  Only 1.4% of all abortions are performed after 20 weeks and those are due to serious, serious issues with either the mother or fetus.  The more difficult a state makes it to obtain an abortion also plays a role in later term abortions.<br>  <br>  Obama knows exactly what he is talking about.  Read the cited article to see what states are doing.|`|XTyAMS5yaa	As Gorgeous pointed out he used the term "pro-abortion" and as far as I know I don't know anyone who's pro-abortion. I know people who don't like butting into other peoples business, but not for abortions.<br>  <br>  He lost all form of credibility and respect in my opinion when he announced Palin as his VP, and even more so since now it's just a pissing contest over who can insult the other candidate more. It's embarrassing really.|`|99xBLoLcaa	Nope. But as nobody will call him on it (at least, nobody whose opinion he considers worthwhile), he's quite safe to do it.<br>  <br>  Politics: The art of whatever you can get away with.|`|VM300US7aa	He definetly lost alot of independent votes with that gaffe.  |`|XsHkWdf7aa	That made me sick as well... Not only does he not care about the health of mothers, but he would go further to say that pro-choice = pro-abortion. There are many reasons a person might want/need an abortion and the only thing that will be accomplished by making abortion illegal again is increasing the death of women who are in desperate need of an abortion. The only choice when abortion is illegal is to find someone shady enough to do the procedure, or you might be lucky to find someone reputable who does it because they actually care about the cause but due to the illegal nature of abortion they can not obtain the proper tools. Abortion is no different that prohibition or the war on drugs. If you take away something that people want/need you are only opening up a market for bad people to do bad things, and lowering the quality of the service that needs to be provided.

"They're working very hard to get all the equipment and supplies here that we need."|`|YIWKPXokaa	No, you are so wrong.    Oh please,    Give it a rest.

Give me an ice storm any day!|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	A president could spend all his time in office going from one disaster to another, or he could do the nations work, as long as hes aware that there was a disaster while it was happening, and not three days later.  Since the National Guard has been called out and no Governor to my knowledge has asked for federal aid yet, and deaths have been minimal  I can't see where, even if he went there he could aid them in any way, when you don't have power, they can't hear or see you there.  I think they would rather see the power crews.  Maybe Obama could look into burying power lines so they don't get damaged by ice and wind storms.  And for the record, not only did Bush not make it to Katrina for days on end, but in those ice storms that knocked out power in the Northeast a few years back, he never showed up for that either.    Thanks for the cite,  Bash, it does seem like instead of visiting, his administration is actually helping.  How refreshing.  Looks like you were wrong, he is doing things.

Where is the federal government and Obama? Because we all know according to the liberals after hurricane Katrina that the president is supposed to respond, regardless of the responsibility of the local and state government.    Yes, I blame it all on Obama applying liberal "logic" to the situation.    Hurricane Katrina "PARASITES": http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1B9Sd4uGT...|`|din2kd3Oaa	Learn how to take care of yourself.

Obama declared parts of the state a federal disaster area Wednesday evening."    Prompt reaction? It took him three days to declare the parts of the state a disaster area. How long did it take for the bush administration to declare the areas hit by Katrina? He declared it BEFORE Katrina struck.     So, lets get this straight. Bush declares a disaster area in time before a disaster, and is denounced for not reacting in time. Obama declares a disaster area 3 days AFTER, and is praised for a "prompt" reaction.|`|Ry61ViNZaa	The mid section of this county is not his base and he basically could care less.

YIWKPXokaa	I think it's fair.|`|pNUtnoC8aa	Hypocrisy at is's finest. I guess Conservative dominated talk radio is a bigger concern then Flag burning.|`|AA10206116	It's illegal. The government cannot force any TV or radio station to run programs for both sides of the story. First amendment rights all the way. Obama is nuts if he thinks he's going to get that passed.|`|EhU2f0NAaa	Yep, I like it.  And, I'm a conservative.      I have a couple requests though.  First, for every liberally slanting newspaper, there must be a conservative newspaper for any particular city.  Second, CBS, NBC, ABC, CNN, and PBS has to have a "fair and balanced" newscast that follows their newscasts...equal time, ya know.  Once that fairness has been established, the big government can force private radio stations, that are in the business of generating a profit by selling air time for advertisements...to put on liberal talk shows that no one wants to listen to.    We can agree?|`|AA10436766	It is not fair to anyone. It's the government restricting the 1st amendment.     They are trying to restrict talk radio. You can guarantee that NPR, ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, and MSNBC will not be required to give the conservatives a chance.    Liberals tried talk radio, Air America, and it did not work. While they were good at putting down America, Air America was boring, just like NPR. No matter what you think about conservative talk radio, you have to admit that it is entertaining.    The only thing that the so called Fairness Doctrine will accomplish is selling more satellite radios because the conservative talk shows will move.|`|6a0dd7563167279d8fff996ef06631f5aa	By your statements you do not understand what the Fairness Doctrine was.    The Fairness Doctrine was a policy (it was abolished in 1987) of the United States Federal Communications Commission (FCC) that required the holders of broadcast licenses both to present controversial issues of public importance and to do so in a manner that is honest, equitable, and balanced.        * This is different from the Equal Time rule. The Fairness Doctrine deals with matters of public importance and has no specific equal-time requirement. The Equal Time rule deals only with political candidates. In American political discourse, these two policies are sometimes falsely conflated.    The rule applied only to licenses issued to public airwaves (radio and network TV).  The rule did not censor or bar the effected stations from airing opinions of any kind..  So your example of there being mandated a Rachel Maddow for every Rush Limbaugh is completely wrong.|`|vzNgMUdBaa	I'm all for it.|`|8iAOasaxaa	This is all posturing and political grandstanding to bring talk radio into the media spotlight.  0bomber wants his media allies to start doing negative stories about Talk Radio  Limbaugh was singled out because he is the most well known Talk Radio host  Limbaugh is also the person the Liberal MSM can easily dig up dirt on  The "Fairness Doctrine " is coming and  Welcome to the beginning of Totalitarian America  The House Rhinos will have their tails between their legs  McCain will kiss 0Bomber's butt on every issue  Polosi and Reid will bring it to 0bomber  0bomber will sign it  Kiss talk radio good by  This is the home base of conservative political shows and christian gospel programs.  2 things that liberals do not want to hear about|`|RtHq6y78aa	It's not FAIR to Conservatives.    Liberals can't succeed in talk radio because no one wants to sit and listen to their lies all the time.|`|q3Vo1s2caa	Actually I'm for the 1st Amendment and the Fairness Doctrine is straight up government censorship.|`|e380b6c435d028a856da0ab58ab394f2aa	Nobody seems to ask why is this for RADIO only????  If it was for TV then we would finally see some fairness after Katie Couric and Keith Olbermann got done with their ranting.|`|gYNDNXAkaa	Anything to piss off Republicans.|`|Hcg2juS7aa	It sounds like censorship to me.  For every liberal newscast, will they have to put on a conservative newscast?  If so, CNN, MSNBC, ABC, CBS, and NBC will have some scrambling to do!|`|Ca8i226Xaa	I can't believe that you are serious. This inappropriately named policy should be called the "Censor Conservatives Act." You libs just cannot stand the fact that most Americans don't want to listen to your anti-American ideas and prefer to listen to patriotic conservatives. Tough, if you try to shove this down our throats, we will take up arms against you, and we have a lot of arms, dude.|`|zjpB2GARaa	There are nothing "fair" about the "Fairness" Doctrine.  It is about destroying free speech, especially of those who aren't party-line Democrats or Republicans.  Do the proponents of the "Fairness" Doctrine advocate requiring that equal time be given to the viewpoints of the Green Party, Libertarian Party, and Constitution Party?  To ask it is to answer it.|`|amfuTEH5aa	Obama seeks to repeal the 1st Amendment.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	It should be renamed the Force Liberal Radio Down Your Throats Doctrine.    If it's enacted, radio stations will go under. People don't listen to Liberal talk radio, advertisers wont advertise if theres no listeners, no advertising money means the radio station goes bankrupt.|`|BC2CNH3jaa	I wish they'd both shut up.  Oh they do if I just turn them off. Seems fair to me.|`|MEReSvZeaa	Misleading title.    Do you remember when the Soviet Union gave all of their states names that made them sound like free countries, they were called "socialist republics"?  Everyone knew they were behind the Iron Curtain but the Soviets did it anyway.    Same with the fairness doctrine.  It FORCES broadcasters to give opposing views air time no matter how ridiculous or unpopular they are.  It should be called the "liberals-will-only-be-heard-by-the-peop... if-they-force-their-voices-into-your livingroom doctrine."    Right now, no one listens to liberal talk radio, and they never will unless you force them.    There's a reason for that.    No one likes hate speech.|`|TfpeYyuwaa	No it is ridiculous, forcing people to express different sides when they don't want to or it isn't profitable for them is censorship.    I like what MSNBC did in response to Fox News blatant bias...we should have a liberal station loaded top to bottom with liberal commentators|`|EhoJ9mgsaa	It's complete bullsh*t. (the fact that it's for radio only [which conservatives dominate] is also suspicious)      What is "fair" can be twisted almost as much as the word "change".|`|IUXriZQJaa	It is not about fairness, and it never was. If it were, then the push for it would not come when the party most represented in the media is in power.    It is an attempt to silence the alternative media's opposition to the MSM agenda    Think about it;    If you don't like what is being said on one news channel, you can change the channel.    Meanwhile, if I wanted to have a radio talk show about the dangers posed by abortion, then the station would have to give equal time to Planned Parenthood or some other interest-conflicted member of the abortion industry,    If a Christian radio station wanted to teach about how to become a Christian, they might have to give equal time to an atheist or a heretic.    It is Hillary's way to silence the alternative media out of frustration from her inability to control it the way she can do with the MSM.

I think some cops think the law doesn't apply  to them. |`|xXEGkEcxaa	Although some states do not yet have laws in place making it illegal to talk on a cell phone while operating a vehicle, it is an unsafe practice no matter where you are!  I would hope that if the officer was using his cell phone while on duty and operating a vehicle, he was doing so legally.  However, I know that some people who are employed to serve and protect have considered themselves above the law.  That is to say, they feel entitlement to break the laws freely, at a whim and using their own set of rules.  <br>  <br>  Unfortunately for all of us tax payers and citizens who follow the letter of the law, making them accountable for their actions is much more difficult than we might expect.  If you were to call his superior to complain, or to report him, you would most likely be met with more trouble than it would be worth.  I can pretty much promise you that you would be met with sarcasm, doubt and attitude.  You would most definitely be met with less than welcome response.   <br>  <br>  Unfortunately we currently live in a society in which it's become one person's word against an other person's word.  We are told to not make waves, never rock the boat, butt out, stay quiet, you know the drill.  But what it means is, keep it to your self and no one will get hurt!  Sorry if this does not answer your question, but maybe explains why it happens regardless!  =o)  <br>  <br>  Addendum:  Another state which recently passed the law in which talking on a cell phone is illegal is Washington State.  This became illegal on July 1st of this year.  Not only is it illegal to drive while talking on the phone, the state took it one step further and made it illegal to text on your cell phone while operating a vehicle.  Idaho has not outlawed these activities yet, but I am sure more states will follow suit soon enough.  I am surprized that smoking while driving is not illegal yet, but surely that too will soon be on the docket!|`|AA12220250	Because cops know what they are doing.

AA12265078	I am pro life, but this is one part of abortion I have not picked a side on yet.  On one hand, the baby did not get to choose who his/her father would be. The fetus is still a person. There is the option of abortion. If I were raped I would keep the child because he/she is still my own flesh and blood.   On the other hand, the woman might not be in the proper mental state after carrying the rape baby for 9 months.  This could be a case where there is a risk to the mother's health.    A common misconception is that Pro lifers want all abortion to be illegal. This is true for some, but others are okay with the exception of rape and risk for the mother's health.|`|Yw7YgG0Kaa	I think it is fine to abort babies that resulted from rape.    But unlike Democrats, I don't make jokes of dead babies.    And.... unlike Democrats, I don't celebrate the yearly figures on the number of abortions.|`|482oQASHaa	I was going to say neither,  but listening to metal mike change my mind|`|TFdKrkP2aa	I am a Christian so I have to be Pro Choice. The bible is very clear, God gave man freewill. God told us to obey mans law, Pro Choice is the law of the land. God told us not to judge man. It is Gods job to judge man. So as a Christian I am required by God to be pro choice.|`|IDDBdU6saa	I guess you never heard the word, "adoption."|`|W2YtVUqKaa	interesting how in this country you are free...as long as you do what everyone else wants you to do. But I don't see anything wrong with abortion. the fetus has no conscious or awareness. and if you are worried about the soul of the "baby" the bible says that a babies soul is in limbo until it is baptized or whatever so what's the problem here?|`|JinXSnnMaa	I'm not quite getting the question. Regardless, I will always be pro choice but would never have an abortion as a means of birth control. Many conservatives believe that is why women have abortions...just too lazy to use condoms. As far as rape or incest, that is such a slippery slope that I doubt the high court will ever revisit or over turn Roe vs. Wade.    If it is ok to have an abortion in the case of rape, what or whom determines a rape? Is it taken soley on the womans word? Do you just need a police report? Or does there need to be a trial and conviction before an abortion can be performed? By then the baby is already born!|`|60YMS1xkaa	Pro-choice. I think you met some people who are pro-choice? Why should the mother have to pay for a bastard's crime? I would never want her to have the baby and have to stare at it everyday, remembering what happened.    As for adoption; most children never end up having a real home. I wouldn't wish that on any child.|`|RnLbJpvTaa	im pro choice. i support womens rights. pro life usually = pro birth|`|JhAghqiAaa	Baby should not be paid for the Dad's crime. Mother should not abandoned their child nor the father. It is shameful to see such things. I think politicians should not be put in place in this situation. This is not a political matter.   Anyway, since God gives the woman the right to keep or not to keep any baby, it is my right as another human being to tell the woman that she should keep the baby or should not keep the baby. She must be her own judge. However, i do not want my tax dollar to be put in use for that purpose.   The mother has the right to reject the pregnancy.   Noone should say that she does not have that right.   I am against abortion to whatever form. However, the only time i am for it if if if and only if the mother's life is in danger.|`|eQPy6KP2aa	I am pro life but feel that politics has no place in this decision. I have not been in been in the shoes of a pregnant rape victim and don't feel qualified to judge. This is between them and their God, they shouldn't have to answer to anyone else.

Both of them are guilty on the ethics department|`|AA11176387	This week I learned of how he did his first wife, saw him and Palin lying about Obama to the point his supporters were saying kill him and watch him interrupt, insist he be given more time in the debate and attack Obama and lie in the debate<br>  <br>  I once respected him as a maverick, lost respect when he started voting with Bush all the time after the meeting where he was apparently offered the presidency and my respect plummeted...after the debate, I started hating him and felt I should campaign for Obama to help assure McCain does not win.<br>  <br>  What a lowlife..he is an opportunist and will do anything to win..he treats women as trophies..he distorts the facts.  He also blinked constantly which people think signified he was lying.<br>  <br>  I do not trust him at all and his character which is a big factor with me is terrible..anyone who would treat the wife who waited 5 years for you and desperately needs you after what she went through from the wreck is such a lowlife and once a liar and cheater,. likely always one.<br>  <br>  On top of it, he seemed so angry and so arrogant.<br>  <br>  I feel john the plumber was a plant by the republicans in order for McCain to say obama wants to tax you to death despite his plan bringing tax relief to 95% of the people and making the very wealthy pay more which many people support,. to say he wanted to redistribute the wealth to tap into the hatred for offering a helping hand to struggling masses,<br>  <br>  I would not be surprised if they also planted the people with the t shirts so he could turn his smear campaign to Obama and say he was the guilty one and his supporters, a classic Carl Rowe tactic..accuse your opponent of what you do..he is so awful, I despise him..<br>  <br>  For all his attacks in the debate, he still came across as too emotional while Obama looked calm, and presidential and addressed accusations adeptly and then brought it back to the people and the issues..McCain looked defensive as well at times.|`|AA11221532	I agree with what you are saying to a point, but I do believe McCain had his best debate last night out of all 3.  I think the Joe the Plumber idea was smart in that it was an attempt to make McCain seem down to earth but bringing it up 33 times - was idiotic.  <br>  <br>  Obama was expecting the Ayers comment and McCain should have never moved into that trap.  That was a mistake on McCain's part.  <br>  <br>  I don't agree with vouchers - I saw how they affected my daughters school in Florida when Jeb put them in place for about two years.  It turned our daughters Private School into a day care.  I will not vote for anyone who agrees with vouchers.  <br>  <br>  I also did not like McCain's stance on Pro-Life no matter what, even at the risk of life to the mother.  <br>  <br>  However, with all that said, McCain would be in better shape if he had done his previous debates like he did last night.  Unfortunately, you can't turn back time and I think it is to late.|`|b3fcaed1380d38d593a8cb71556b4d96aa	Lana, I wonder if you'd be as forgiving if Senator Obama had been caught cheating on his wife.  <br>  But, I agree, this stuff is all just nonsense.  And if I never see or hear Joe the Plumber again, that'll be fine with me.  <br>  This morning, he said that when it came to tap dancing (around a question), Obama was better than Sammy Davis, Jr.  What kind of ridiculous remark is that?  I can't believe everyone is just letting that slide by.  <br>  Edit:  Rab, I agree with your thoughtful comments.  I've worked in public education, and I agree that vouchers will not work.  I worked in one of the worst school districts in the state (NY).  It was so bad, the state came in and took it over.  It's still a mess, and it's not for lack of money or lack of dedicated teachers.  It's a very complex problem, and giving people vouchers to leave those schools is not going to help anything.  And, where are they going to go?  How many students can the "good" schools take in?  And will they remain good once they get an influx of students who can't or don't want to do the work?

The CNN "Truth Squad" is so biased towards Obama that when they have to say that McCain is telling they truth, they don't say it and call it "misleading". <br>  <br>  Fox always has an even number of dem and rep whenever they have a discussion.

In America it has become Islam and anything vaguely socialism.  It has almost become a crime in America to even mention the government helping the less fortunate.  Fascism also displays an over abundance of patriotism.  In America everything you say is put up against the chart of patriotism.  Fascism encompasses the Rambo delusion of being the strongest and being unfairly picked upon to such a degree that one acts out in violence.

I believe this article sums it up in a way that it is much easier to understand.  I copied this off of a web page.<br>  <br>  'Obama's 95% Illusion <br>  It depends on what the meaning of 'tax cut' is. One of Barack Obama's most potent campaign claims is that he'll cut taxes for no less than 95% of "working families." He's even promising to cut taxes enough that the government's tax share of GDP will be no more than 18.2% -- which is lower than it is today.<br>  It's a clever pitch, because it lets him pose as a middle-class tax cutter while disguising that he's also proposing one of the largest tax increases ever on the other 5%. But how does he conjure this miracle, especially since more than a third of all Americans already pay no income taxes at all? There are several sleights of hand, but the most creative is to redefine the meaning of "tax cut."<br>  For the Obama Democrats, a tax cut is no longer letting you keep more of what you earn. In their lexicon, a tax cut includes tens of billions of dollars in government handouts that are disguised by the phrase "tax credit." Mr. Obama is proposing to create or expand no fewer than seven such credits for individuals:<br>  - A $500 tax credit ($1,000 a couple) to "make work pay" that phases out at income of $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 per couple.<br>  - A $4,000 tax credit for college tuition.<br>  - A 10% mortgage interest tax credit (on top of the existing mortgage interest deduction and other housing subsidies).<br>  - A "savings" tax credit of 50% up to $1,000.<br>  - An expansion of the earned-income tax credit that would allow single workers to receive as much as $555 a year, up from $175 now, and give these workers up to $1,110 if they are paying child support.<br>  - A child care credit of 50% up to $6,000 of expenses a year.<br>  - A "clean car" tax credit of up to $7,000 on the purchase of certain vehicles.<br>  Here's the political catch. All but the clean car credit would be "refundable," which is Washington-speak for the fact that you can receive these checks even if you have no income-tax liability. In other words, they are an income transfer -- a federal check -- from taxpayers to nontaxpayers. Once upon a time we called this "welfare," or in George McGovern's 1972 campaign a "Demogrant." Mr. Obama's genius is to call it a tax cut.<br>  The Tax Foundation estimates that under the Obama plan 63 million Americans, or 44% of all tax filers, would have no income tax liability and most of those would get a check from the IRS each year. The Heritage Foundation's Center for Data Analysis estimates that by 2011, under the Obama plan, an additional 10 million filers would pay zero taxes while cashing checks from the IRS.<br>  The total annual expenditures on refundable "tax credits" would rise over the next 10 years by $647 billion to $1.054 trillion, according to the Tax Policy Center. This means that the tax-credit welfare state would soon cost four times actual cash welfare. By redefining such income payments as "tax credits," the Obama campaign also redefines them away as a tax share of GDP. Presto, the federal tax burden looks much smaller than it really is.<br>  The political left defends "refundability" on grounds that these payments help to offset the payroll tax. And that was at least plausible when the only major refundable credit was the earned-income tax credit. Taken together, however, these tax credit payments would exceed payroll levies for most low-income workers.<br>  It is also true that John McCain proposes a refundable tax credit -- his $5,000 to help individuals buy health insurance. We've written before that we prefer a tax deduction for individual health care, rather than a credit. But the big difference with Mr. Obama is that Mr. McCain's proposal replaces the tax subsidy for employer-sponsored health insurance that individuals don't now receive if they buy on their own. It merely changes the nature of the tax subsidy; it doesn't create a new one.<br>  <br>  There's another catch: Because Mr. Obama's tax credits are phased out as incomes rise, they impose a huge "marginal" tax rate increase on low-income workers. The marginal tax rate refers to the rate on the next dollar of income earned. As the nearby chart illustrates, the marginal rate for millions of low- and middle-income workers would spike as they earn more income.<br>  <br>  Some families with an income of $40,000 could lose up to 40 cents in vanishing credits for every additional dollar earned from working overtime or taking a new job. As public policy, this is contradictory. The tax credits are sold in the name of "making work pay," but in practice they can be a disincentive to working harder, especially if you're a lower-income couple getting raises of $1,000 or $2,000 a year. One mystery -- among many -- of the McCain campaign is why it has allowed Mr. Obama's 95% illusion to go unans

Do the following:<br>  a)  contact the head of each of these various organizations and arrange an appointment to see he or she at a mutually convient time.<br>  2)  Draft up a questionnaire with respect to these individuals agencies and take it with you to be answered in full by the heads of these various departments.  Write down their answers in front of them as they speak.  Be precise.<br>  3)  Make absolutely sure that your three year record is expunged.  That is paramount as it relates to your husband's position and your standing in the community.<br>  4)  After you have made detailed record and the response to each official has been recorded by you, contact you Law Society in the State or Province that you live and have them give you the name of a lawyer with whom you can speak or, pick out a lawyer proficent in litigation and see him.

ox4tmOpJaa	I go the other way on this. I think we need to get rid of the parties altogether. People are still going to vote the same way that they would within a party, but it would get rid of the thought party before country; which is going on with President Obamas second pick for commerce currently and when sitting leaders change parties etc.    I also think it is time that we the people get to vote when congress gets a raise. I dont know if it is true, but I was told as they were working on the bailout that both parties came together to give themselves a raise. It is nice that they can be bipartisan, but have they really earned a raise when people are losing their jobs at a rate close to the great depression? Any legislator that voted for a raise (if one did happen) and kept their seat for this congress should be removed.     I believe without parties it would be easier to get legislation passed such as this. I believe there are too many that are nothing more than seat fillers that stand up from time to time when it is time to run again. Without the support of their party, and with only the support of their supporters I feel that real change will come along.|`|qEp9fxU9aa	No we need the current members to read the constitution along with their oath.

AA10266252	The first amendment guarantees Americans the right to religious freedom under the law, so no, we are not a Christian nation.  It would be unconstitutional for congress to pass a law that elevated one religion over another, or limited the practice of religion.    But it's important to distinguish between religion and morality.  Bush vetoed the bill not because it was not Christian but because he believed it was not moral.  The president does have the legal right to veto any bill that passes in Congress with less than a 2/3 majority, and he is expected to act in accordance with his understanding of morality.    The problem lies not in the fact that Bush vetoed a bill on moral grounds, but the fact that his moral objection to the bill had no basis in reality.  The stem cell research that would have been funded had the bill passed deals only with DISCARDED embryos from fertility clinics and abortion clinics.  No human embryos are created for the harvesting of stem cells or any other research purposes.  These are not embryos that were ever going to have the chance to develop into a child anyway.  These are embryos that were going to be destroyed, and all that researchers were asking was to be allowed to use the cells from these embryos to potentially save countless lives and restore quality of life to countless more.  To say that the stem cell research effected by the bill would result in the deaths of otherwise viable embryos is simply a misstatement of fact, and to veto it on that grounds is, quite frankly, idiotic.      Edit: I want to point out a couple of things.  Several answerers have claimed that America is or was a Christian nation because our Founding Fathers were predominalty Christian.  This is simply not true.  Our Founding Fathers made VERY clear that they wanted a SECULAR government, as evidenced by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and various other documents.  Although they may have been born to Christian families, the most influential of our Founding Fathers were not Christian.      George Washington never publically stated his religion, but upon his death, his friends described him as a Deist.  Thomas Jefferson also never identified as belong to any relgion, but rather stated, " I am of a sect by myself, as far as I know."  Benjamin Franklin was a Deist.    Here's what some of our founding fathers had to say about Christianity:    "I have examined all the known superstitions of the world, and I do not find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature. They are all alike founded on fables and mythology."  -Thomas Jefferson    "The Christian church has set up a religion of pomp and revenue in pretended imitation of a person (Jesus) who lived a life of poverty." -Thomas Paine    "The Government of the United States is not in any sense founded on the Christian religion." -The Treaty of Tripoli, Article 11, which was signed by John Adams, among others.    "The doctrine of the divinity of Jesus is made a convenient cover for absurdity." -John Adams    "It is the duty of every true Deist to vindicate the moral justice of God against the evils of the Bible." -Thomas Paine    "A just government, instituted to secure and perpetuate liberty, does not need the clergy." -James Madison    "Religion and government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together." -James Madison    Also, at the time of the signing of the Delcaration of Independence, only 7% of the population of the 13 colonies belonged to a church.    Finally, someone pointed to the "Under God" clause of the Pledge of Allegence, and I want to clarify that the phrase was added during the height of the Cold War to distinguish us from the "Godless Communists," and was no included in the Pledge before that point.  Nor does any reference to God in any of the documents alluded to in any of the other answers to this question specify it is the Christian God they are refering to.|`|1317e68c02d250de1760eb4315d4eaa9aa	The United States WAS ONCE A CHRISTIAN NATION  the declaration of independance and other historical documents were based on christianity. That is most likely why he made the decision he did.|`|f52d0e0d68fe751ba99b9760222dec30aa	There are several questions in your one question. First - "There are no laws that define life as beginning at conception - and the current legal status of abortion would seem to suggest that, legally, it does not." The societal law does not create natural law; it is designed to reflect it and protect it in society. At present, there is a law assessing a fine of $50,000 and a possible prison sentence for killing an unborn baby eagle in the egg; that is societal law protecting life at conception. The only reason they allow unborn humans to be killed is for convenience, financial profit and avoidance of conscience. Hence, the laws of the land are being changed to reflect a changing morality, not necessarily a new scientific understanding of the Laws of Nature, which never change, regardless of who is in power.    Regarding the president's faith in office: when elected to power by the majority, he is called to govern the land according to all that he is -- his knowledge, ability, wisdom, experience and his faith. Those who voted form him expected him to govern by these virtues, for they reflect the virtues of his supporters. It is for this reason that the majority voted for him -- because they identified with his faith and other virtues and expected him to make decisions for them that represented their will (and faith) as well. A person's faith is part of what they are, not just what they believe.    Is America a Christian Nation? According to the founding Fathers, it was upon conception, but it has changed. 52 of the 55 founding fathers were clearly Christians. America was founded on Christian principles. Look at the content of Blackstone's book of law, which is the basis for America's legal system. It is filled with biblical references as reasons for it's laws. Our very design of government, The Judicial branch (judges), Legislative branch  (prophets, or law-givers) and Executive branch (the king) was taken directly from the Old Testament system of government. Patrick Henry stated very clearly, "It cannot be stated too loudly or too strongly that America was founded, not by religionists, but by Christians, not upon religion, but upon the gospel of Jesus Christ."    Of course, it has now become a humanist country by majority, according to its current laws, and as a result we now have the chaos and self destruction you presently see when we govern ourselves by human feelings and desires set at liberty without conscience or consequence, accountable to no one.|`|a15649f54756969bc62402e21cfe37bdaa	Polling indicates that the nation is about 85 percent Christian, according to Fox News.    A President makes decisions based on personal opinion, correct?  How are his opinions sans faith any more 'offensive' than his opinions based on his faith?    I would say that since 85 percent of the nation raises their hand to being Christian, he is representing as best he can.  In this field, at least.  We won't get into this war on terror, as well as phone tapping.    Lets add in the fact that he is a conservative... is this veto surprising to anyone at all?  It shouldn't be.  We all knew before hand where Bush stood on the Christianity-o-meter, his fundamentalist action should not be startling.    As it goes for what was mentioned above- I must say that I disagree that those of other faiths are really alienated.  If an atheist can raise a stink about where the ten commandments are, about the word 'God' being uttered in our Plegde of Allegiance, and about a Christian child's right to pray inside a school... I don't know how we could use the word 'alienation' toward non-Christians.|`|AA11313161	yes it is that  what it was  built around way back in George Washington days .if you look at the picture in the white house of these old men their holding the bible in all of them|`|AA10597957	We are a country that was founded by christian people and principles.  That said, we are heavily dominated by christian "things".  Just look at the many influences-- oaths are taken on a bible, In God we trust is on the money, Pledge of alligence "under God", Daily prayer in congress (christian prayer).    So for many intents and purposes, yes.  However, there is room for non-christians and non-belivers.  That is the whole concept of freedom of religion.    Consider this though-- there are many countries (e.g. in Europe) which have even more christian influences.  In fact, many state schools (e.g. in Germany) have religious education (christian).  There are also many christian state holidays in those countries.  What's ironic though is that for all the bitching about liberals being Godless, those left-leaning countries have alot of God in their worlds.|`|AA11968156	nope. the united states is a multicultural nation. chistians simply make up the majority of the population.|`|AA11844717	America is not a Christian nation.  However, Bush is Christian.  He should not be making decisions based on his personal faith, but can you truly say that you expected better of him?|`|07fc812d0dc3ebbb3675e59013364f4aaa	the president is entitled to his beliefs. however, i'm entitled to mine as well.    when he governs, he should be able to give reasons for his decisions. "because of my faith" is never sufficient if his decision has forced me to do something counter to mine. for example, if he believes there are souls that appear at conception that need to be protected... he should have to prove it.    that is my concern; i am nervous about laws that have no obvious reasoning behind them. i'm an agnostic, and i do not see the same things he does. does that mean i'm blind or that he's making it up? that should not be an option... i should have every right to demand some logic for our laws that does not require me to see spooks.|`|570706ec52e5248d965c4cda9660efa9aa	America is an "agnostic and secular" state.|`|AA10260805	of course we are not|`|9c0c829a871a18f8cfcfbb157ce6be25aa	Get used to the trend my friend.

Our forefathers also wore wigs, does that make us a wig wearing nation?|`|09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	America is a Christian nation.  It has a certain culture that incubates a Christian way of life; many Americanized people are assimilated into such a culture.  Sure, there are people of other religions living in the country, but ultimately, they are alienated as not belonging to the  nation per se.  Of course, by definition, a nation is a group of people bound by a common culture.  So, there is a difference between living in America and actually being an "American" or belonging to the "American nation."  This also explains the American enmity towards Islamic nations and American alliances with similar European Christian nations and the Jewish nation Israel.  There is always a certain cultural bias that determines war and peace, even in a country that claims equality and religious freedom that is never actualized.  Note: to explain the tendency towards secularism, we must see the hypocritical deviance that exists within the American culture.|`|235156626c3ce0baff2fe60ac814f05aaa	Well, the President just vetoed legislation that  70% of the population wanted because of fundamentalist beliefs.  To a certain extent, our government is controlled by a minority religious group - christian fundamentalists -not to be confused with regular Christians - most of whom are intelligent enough to know the difference between an embryo and a human.
V9DCA4d4aa	I like Obama because he didn't graduated 855 out of 859.|`|c6ae24163201dd9441cf82fe192785bfaa	I agree 100% with Pamela.  Nobody has inspired, not only Americans, but people around the world like Obama since Bobby Kennedy.<br>  <br>  I like Obama because he's surrounded himself with intelligent people and listens to them as they listen to him.  So far he has kept a high tone through some of the toughest insults and accusations from the primary to now.  Not only that, but he's actually answered most of the fears of people directly and openly and intelligently.  These are the traits I believe are needed in the White House.  After 8 years of "bad intellegence" knee jerk reactions, secrecy, fear and greed Obama comes on like a breath of fresh air.  <br>  There are other reasons, but for me, that's the underlying reason.<br>  <br>  I lost respect for McCain when he began pandering to the right wing crowd.  Before this he had been known as a moderate.  I can't be sure, but it appears he or his advisers thought he needed a right wing base.  I  could stomach his appeal to the political evangelicals (an old Republican manuever since Nixon and Billy Graham) but when he picked Sarah Palin it made me question his integrity and it has come up lacking .|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	I cannot choose one thing about Obama.<br>  <br>  I like his background, his values, the way that he and Michelle both pulled themselves up by the bootstraps with their intellect, hard work and perseverance (unlike many candidates who shall remain nameless). I've read about how his campaign is being run and I like how organized and cohesive it is - to me that bodes well for how he will work with others, both nationally and internationally. <br>  <br>  Biden has a terrific rep for being able to work well with just about anyone. Both candidates are intelligent and articulate and will help to restore our credibility internationally. The past 8 years I've been embarrassed to be an American.<br>  <br>  For the first time since Bobby Kennedy was assassinated in '68, I am truly excited about the possibility of positive, progressive change.<br>  <br>  I don't like McCain because he strikes me as a nasty spoiled brat who somehow thinks he is entitled to the presidency.|`|lTlaNwtgaa	i like obama b/c it's time for a change|`|TxC6Fry0aa	I like Obama because he supports our military and our Veterans. <br>  I don't like McCain because he doesn't...and because he is no longer the man he once was: <a href="http://www.iava.org/full-ratings-list" rel="nofollow">http://www.iava.org/full-ratings-list</a><br>  <a href="http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/?Page=Article&ID=9559" rel="nofollow">http://www.veteransforcommonsense.org/?P...</a>

Oh no,it was not Barak, who sent the media in to do a hit, but it was the McCain bunch, that ridiculed and made a big story out of Obama's talking to Joe the Plumber.  It was your bunch that did that , and I also want to tell you that the Democrats are not parasites, living off of a free hand out.  You got money then put it where your mouth is.      I work hard and have earned good money all my life, and never once taken a free handout or welfare.      BUT I have  helped many people who are so down and out and depend on the Republican Welfare Plan.   By the middle of the month this large family has nothing.  I have bought many needed things for the Family and continue to do so.  So don't go and degrade the Democrats, you don't know diddley about them.   But we do help the Poor and down trodden.   We don't stick our snotty snoots in the air , and pretend we don't see the American's who are in need.    God says to help the poor, I guess you fall into that catagory of not helping the poor. <br>     McCain stuck his own foot in his big mouth, and above  the mouth are two brown  eyes, that roll around un-controlable.

He had no children.  <br>  <br>  Anyway, who knows what way these supposed relatives would vote.<br>  <br>  If you look at most German-American immigrants though they do tend to statistically vote Democrat.  This is because they believe in big government and the strong hand of government.  Of course, this runs counter to the true American ideal of rugged individualism and freedom. <br>  <br>  I did come across an older German couple on the airplane when I was in Germany last month and I was shocked to learn that they had just visited the son of a man who was hanged for war crimes during WWII.  The father had been convicted of killing millions.  Of course, they said the son was not to blame, but I was a bit uncomfortable about it when I heard about it.  Apparently, they all went to school together.  Anyway, I felt that they had a certain sympathy for the old ways and the regime of 1930-40s Germany and I was really repulsed by that.<br>  They were 100% in favor of Obama and were sorry they couldn't vote as they were German citizens.  I felt they were actually anti-American and said some unpleasant stereotypical things about America.  And they wanted Obama desperately to win.  Made me really sit up and think.|`|VYS8OHGcaa	If they have Hitler's beliefs, they'd vote for Obama.

That's why the libs want huge numbers of third world immigrants to come to the USA, more Democrat voters. You are correct that countries with one group are more likely to have less crime than countries with a diverse population, and the same thing can be said for cities.    Now that European countries have so many third world peoples, their crime rates have soared and they are having more riots.

yvPA8FSsaa	You are exactly right.  Do not expect City people to understand.  They really do not know what self-reliance means.  In a city if someone is breaking into your home you call 911 and the police show up in a few minutes.  In Rural America, if someone is breaking into your home and you call 911 it can be 20 minutes to a half-hour until the police arrive.  In the meantime you are self-reliant.  <br>  <br>  If someone is badly injured or has a heart attack in the city, you call 911 and an ambulance is there in a few minutes.  In not so in rural areas.  In fact, you can probably drive that person to the hospital quicker than an ambulance can even get to him.  <br>  <br>  Storms knock down trees and power lines in the city people are helpless until someone clears the downed trees and restores power.  In rural areas  you switch on your generator, get out your chain saw and start cutting away the branches blocking your way.<br>  <br>  It is a very different lifestyle.  It is like night and day.  <br>  <br>  *|`|Lk46wreDaa	you're being very very biased.  you very obviously favor rural people.  <br>  <br>  and by the way....those who are less intelligent tend to the ones who judge the most, and yes, you just judged city people.<br>  <br>  I don't live in the city because I want government handouts.  I live in the city because it's more fun than living in the middle of no where.  And trust me, yes, there are lots of people in the city who rely on the government, but there are also lots like me, who just can't stand living in the middle of no where but are perfectly capable of taking care of themselves.  Your assertion was somewhat right, but you shouldn't have judged all city people to be that way.|`|53MiP9bEaa	You obviously are a republican living in a rural area.  Have you ever lived in a city?  I doubt it.  I've lived in both city and rural areas and I think your full of sh*t.  Slightly retarded even. |`|1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa	No. this city guy thinks all of your characterizations are stupid and without any merit.|`|AA10592458	Well many people who live in the inter-cities are very Liberal.  I mean come on they rely on the government to help, pay and support them when the government was not set up to do so.  And those who aren't democrat and live in the city, register democrat only to be able to participate in local elections.  You won't be able to vote if you are Republican and only Democrats are running.  <br>  <br>  Personally, I hate living in the city.  I don't have money but I don't and won't take or rely on the government or cities money for welfare, free healtcare, food stamps and wic.  I've been at the bottom and out and I found ways around it.  I think the government needs to stop being so helpful to those who abuse the system!!!|`|EGpDq57kaa	I'm in rural Va and i look out for myself,grow food,hunt,fish and overall make a good living.<br>  <br>  Here's a lil story about city pepole,,me and my cousin go out and shoot rocks over in the field with 22 rifles,,one day a boyfriend of my niece was here and we had the guns and said we were going out to smoke some rocks,in a lil while this guy came out and ask if he could smoke a rock,we handed him a gun an he asked us what he was supposed  to do with it.I said,try to smoke a rock over there in the field............he went back in the house  lol<br>  <br>  EDIT: I forgot the question lol ,,,yeah you're right<br>  <br>  MCCAIN/PALIN or Slavery|`|JxtEqpzPaa	I am from a rural area and when people have problem and are about to lose their homes, they don't picket and whine and cry...<br>  <br>  We hold fund raisers and charity events to raise the money for them.<br>  <br>  We don't need the government in our business...

I wouldn't say city or rural people are smarter than the other. There are plenty of trailer park, mental rejects living off the government in the rural areas of our country, and there are plenty of trailer park-like mental rejects living in the city. You should know that because I have a feeling that one of those trailer park mental rejects in the rural area is your neighbor.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Better check your 'facts' again.  |`|WhUV9k6Jaa	People in cities rely on Government for everything?<br>  <br>  An erroneous assumption that taints your line of reasoning.  Get back on your sister Jethro.|`|UvzKiis0aa	Apparently you don't understand how many people in rural areas are on welfare since there are not many jobs in the middle of nowhere.  Also, rural areas don't have the money for roads, schools or even electricity and plumbing if it wasn't for the taxes paid by all those city folk. <br>  <br>  Rural folk are not self reliant, they just tell themselves they are.  Look at Alaska and how much federal money they get per citizen.  It is about 5 times the amount Illinois residents get.  All of the western states excluding California get back more money than they put in the pot and same with the South.  It is really sick when country folk suck on the government teat and lie about it, even worse spit in the eye of the people who are supporting them.  If it wasn't for the federal government, most rural people would be living in shacks with outhouses, heated with wood, lit with kerosene and pulling your water from the well. <br>  <br>  Admit it, you just pulled this idea out of your butt, didn't you?

Bush is not a Reagan conservative. Reagan would not be doing what Bush and Paulson are doing, which is printing up money and throwing it at people. This is a big government, socialist solution that will never work. Bush has soiled the republican brand name. People want change, so they've turned to Obama. The problem with that is that they aren't doing their homework, because Obama is offering nothing more than the same socialist poison only in a higher, more concentrated dose.|`|cRDbeUDvaa	Conservatism can't be centrist, so that's out.  And it has plenty of intellectuals like Brooks, Charles Krauthammer, and George Will.  What conservatism needs is to quit embracing stupid as a virtue.

The land speculators back in the 1700s went bankrupt. We've been here before. <br>  <br>  It's hard to say. Some people that are conservatives are in denial. Some see it and support Ron Paul. The problem with conservatives is that they are not realistic and seem to forget the part of "promote the general welfare of the people". Why was this included? There was a reason. To promote stability and security. That's why I think it was included. <br>  <br>  There is much to be learned from our past.<br>  <br>  edit: We need more intellectuals all around, people that think and are able to process lots of information and make sense of it. You can't just wing it. That's why we are here. We winged it and thought we knew more than we actually did. Talk about a risky strategy. The only thing propping up our economy was consumers using debt to buy things. That is not a strategy that can continue into the future. Now we are in danger or sinking countries like Japan because they depend on us Americans to buy the products they export to us. If we don't have money to buy then we won't be buying what they send to us. <br>  <br>  We are in a disaster. Unprecedented is a term I hear a lot. It's not shocking to me. This is time to pay the bill. If we had intellectuals running things then we would not be here. That's the bottom line.|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	It's an interesting piece and makes some good points.  <br>  <br>  My personal political views have always leaned towards progression and I am a Democrat, born and bred.

That is why Mexico does not provide that service to its poor people.  Why do you think we should pay for it for people who are not our own?

c7841bb366a0e8445d3b42c077882169aa	She is an obvious threat to Obama's chance of winning, that is why so many resources have been spent attacking her and smeearing her family. <br>  <br>   In a way, she is to Obama what Obama was to Hillary.<br>  <br>  You have to admit that Obama has gotten an easy ride in the media compared to Palin (and Hillary for that matter).  I agree they should put her out there and I posted about this on McCain space yesterday, I think she could be a real asset to the campaign, she just needs her confidence back again.  I have also heard that even McCain is not happy with her handlers treatment of her (Bill Kristol said this and I believe he does have access to this information).  <br>  <br>  The type of experience Palin has is that in which there is more accountability.  Executive positions are subjected to more accountability than legislative positions and that is just fact.  Obama's U.S. senate accomplishments as far as leadership goes - he doesn't have any.  Only 2 bills he introduced have been passed into law - one to name a post office, one for the Congo.  He has co-signed legislation - but Senators can co-sign legfislation right up until it goes to vote, it doesn't necessarily mean that they did anything.  She has actually done something in regards to energy in this country (with the pipeline), Obama has co-sponsored a piece of faulty legislation about E-85 corn ethanol (waste of time). <br>  <br>  As far as the family matters go, I'm not even going to address it.  Men are never subjected to the same scrutiny as woman on this point and it is sexist.  As far as Bristol goes, again, you are only speculating, you have no evidence that the marriage isn't something that they want or that it is being forced upon them.  <br>  <br>  In my heart of hearts yes, I do feel she is the right woman for the job.  I was one of those people that knew about her and was hoping he would pick her for his VP.  <br>  <br>  About the Russia issue, I get what she was trying to say.  I mean, I get why is played wrong, but I understand where she was coming from ...   <br>  <br>  "There have been eight incidents off Alaska since July. Among the latest, on September 5, six F-15s from Elmendorf Air Force Base, adjacent to Anchorage, Alaska, intercepted six Russian bombers about 50 miles from the northwest coast of Alaska. <br>  <br>  Two similar incidents occurred in August, one near Cape Lisburne, Alaska, and the other near Cold Bay, Alaska, west of the Aleutian Islands."<br>  <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/11/russian.bomber/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/02/11/russian...</a><br>  <br>  ALSO ...<br>  <br>  "She responded, quite sensibly to a question that is ambiguous, "In what respect, Charlie?" <br>  <br>  Sensing his "gotcha" moment, Gibson refused to tell her. After making her fish for the answer, Gibson grudgingly explained to the moose-hunting rube that the Bush doctrine "is that we have the right of anticipatory self-defense." <br>  <br>  Wrong. <br>  <br>  I know something about the subject because, as the Wikipedia entry on the Bush doctrine notes, I was the first to use the term. In the cover essay of the June 4, 2001, issue of the Weekly Standard entitled, "The Bush Doctrine: ABM, Kyoto, and the New American Unilateralism," I suggested that the Bush administration policies of unilaterally withdrawing from the ABM treaty and rejecting the Kyoto protocol, together with others, amounted to a radical change in foreign policy that should be called the Bush doctrine." <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a>|`|60b9dfe6f51297e42ee09b44b6987147aa	You have several questions, so I will try to hit them one at a time.

This groups support was very shaky and as such was good news for democrats. now that they are excited about the ticket, that makes it a tighter race.<br>  <br>  2- I think the gotcha media stunts have gone on several times, usually involving a twisting of her position or the issue. For example, Gibson asked the question about the Bush Doctrine and it was made into a big deal when he explained what he meant by "Bush Doctrine". However, as Charles Krauthammer pointed out, there have been 4 positions called the Bush Doctrine.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/12/AR2008091202457_pf.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/con...</a><br>  <br>  3- I do not think she does have more of a base in foreign affairs. In fact, I think it is democrats tha tkeep saying Obama has more asa means of hiding his serious lack of leadership experience. The yboth have the same amount of foreign policy experience, that is, none. What Palin brings to the table is executive experience, not just as a mayor but as a governor. This is by far more than Obama and Biden combined.<br>  <br>  4- I think it is insulting to every working woman out there to say she is incapable of balancing work and career. Remember she does have a husband who, when they move to DC, becomes a full time house dad.<br>  <br>  5- the issue of her daughter's pregnancy has been made a big deal by the democrats. They were the ones that started spreading rumors about Trig being her grandson and not her son. So they had to come out with the fact her daughter in currently pregnant. This of course then was jumped on by democrats as a means of demeaning her for her abstanence only position. The whole issue of the wedding is being done to counter democrat attacks. Sad that a person's personal life has to be put under such scrutiny, but that is current politics. Republicans also praise her for supporting her daughter through this time instead of pushing for an abortion, confirming her pro-life credentials.<br>  <br>  6- I am not sure why she has not been hitting the interview circuit more, but I think it has to do with building suspense prior to the debate with Biden and also to shield her from an obviously hostile media.<br>  <br>  7- People are not calling critics sexists because of their opposition to her positions. The yare calling them sexists by harping on her beauty pagent participation, her home life, whether of not she can be a good mother and still hold a job, etc. These I think ARE sexist. By the way, why is it when people raise objections over Obama's positions they are labeled racists?<br>  <br>  8- Is she the best person for the job? I am not sure. There are a lot of poeple that I think could do the job quite well that I would have liked to see, but I understand why she was picked and, while maybe not the best candidate, she is a good one.|`|ljmE8eLLaa	I've heard that Gibson's interview was edited in an effort to disparage Palin. I don't know if that's true, but why don't we wait and see how the debate turns out on Thursday. Biden is famous for putting his foot in his mouth. |`|YqaKgYQ9aa	I like Sarah Palin.  It means alot to me that she is not part of the political click. To take an already polished politician, I'm afraid they would be corrupt.  I believe she is Intelligent, learns fast, and will serve well.  |`|OAnyhXDVaa	The republicans are not going to answer this question directly you are stating too many facts here they'd rather slander the opposing team to make a point.|`|2bead0318840910522a4607acde0bb73aa	I am not scared of her....You people did the same thing to Hillary, you tried to assassinate her character....She was a lair, she wanted Obama assassinated, and the silly list goes on and on....You people are not fair minded and I have stopped listening to the liberal hacks and the Obamabots.|`|6c738af4ac776343f2bc535bba7907ceaa	That's a lot of questions in one long diatribe...my opinion, and I like Palin, is people project their own hang-ups, fears, dreams and ideals onto this woman...she is a public figure and a very strong personality...Palin is a smart woman but yes, has been thrust onto a stage that is beyond her knowledge for now...so she is being trained...look at it as a wonderful opportunity for her to grow and become great...her teachers are the best there are...and she would learn so much by McCain's side...if I was political I would envy her this opportunity..but I'm not..lol...and she can love and support her kids and govern...women have been great all throughout history and yes, with babies on their hips...|`|WvYw2xvdaa	Because that is all the Dems talk about, Palin this & Palin that. The Dems are so sure Obama is going to win why are they so fixed on Palin?|`|1ff5a0f9f2f375177ccd4d1d9b58b3aeaa	-Why is it that republicans think that democrats are scared of Sarah Palin? Isn't it possible that democrats (and a lot of republicans now) see that she is just out of her league?<br>  <br>  When she was first announced, the Dems were scared of her, they thought she had clinched the election for McCain.  Now I think a bit of that lingers, most Repubs like her, and quite a few Independents as well and now the Dems know that despite the media coverage, those voters will not flip to Obama.<br>  <br>  -Why do they think that she's been the victim of gotcha journalism? (I believe that Ms Couric's and Mr Gibson's questions were both very direct and asked questions that a country full of people want to know about her positions and ideas on several issues concerning the country.<br>  <br>  My opinion is that those journalists are trying to make a name for themselves as hard hitting journalists and asking difficult questions and belaboring the point when she doesn't answer as they think she should.  Sarah is a great speaker and is usually well informed and real to the viewers.  I think it is nerves and being put in that position with Democratic interviewers.  When Charles was here in Alaska, in an interview with our local news, he said she was straightforward and very personable.<br>  <br>  - What grounds do you have for saying that Sarah Palin has more of a base in foreign affairs and general American politics issues than Senator Obama?<br>  <br>  I wouldn't say that she does have more.  I think they are pretty equal.  Living abroad at 6 years old does not equate to FA experience, neither does rock star type gatherings.<br>  <br>  - How much time do you think she will be able to dedicate to her five children, including a little boy with down's syndrome and a pregnant 17 year old daughter if she is elected to the second highest position into this country? or, how much time will she be able to spend being an appropriate vice president when she has a full family that's about to get even fuller?<br>  <br>  She has done a wonderful job as Governor of Alaska with her children and while pregnant.  I believe that is a sexist question.  Single moms have to work, are you insinuating that their children are neglected?  Sarah is very driven but is also a wonderful mom.<br>  <br>  - Why is she and her daughter being applauded instead of left alone on the delicate matter of pregnancy before a person is ready for it? Why are republicans trying to orchestrate appearances of the two teens together and a quickie wedding before the election?<br>  <br>  This is a damned if you do or damned if you don't situation.  She announced her daughters pregnancy within days of being chosen, should she have announced it during her acceptance speech?  Her family matters are not our concern.<br>  <br>  - Why is she now not allowed to talk without John McCain by her side? Why is she not allowed to talk, period?<br>  <br>  She's allowed to talk without him, they did a joint interview and it is being construed into something else.<br>  <br>  - Why are people who question her about her ideals or opinions being called sexist when Hilary was called terrible things by the public at large when she started to take a little more control of the country?<br>  <br>  I don't think they are any more than I think someone who doesn't like Obamas policies is a racist.  I'm sure a few are actually sexist/racist, but the vast majority are not.  It's just the quickest and easiest way to insult someone and put them in a defense position rather than allowing them to speak their piece.<br>  <br>  <br>  and finally,<br>  <br>  - In your heart of hearts, do you really think that Sarah Palin is the right woman for the job?<br>  <br>  Yes I do, personal experience with her as our governor.  If people would give her a chance, they would see that it makes a lot more sense to have someone you can relate to and who can relate to you in an office of power.  She has kids, lived closer to our income level than others in Washington and is a pioneer for government transparency.  <br>  <br>  <br>  EDIT- Fine, as yesterday, you are way too emotional about this issue to listen to others opinions.  Which is what you asked for, right?  You are not an American (as you said yesterday) and we answered your questions- in great detail, I might add.<br>  <br>   If you cannot handle even reading an opposing position, you should really stop asking questions, it just seems to enrage you that others do not take your views as fact.  I don't care what your views are, but if you want the honest views of others, you need a little anger management first|`|398cff3a3911e99788e6c043af2093abaa	Thank you for the well written question.  I feel pretty much the same way about Palin, and am wondering the same thing.  However, I have not been able to get a conversation started on the topic with anyone without somebody insulting somebody (either liberal or conservative). |`|HqdJ3A8Xaa	Well, we can tell the Dems are scared of Governor Palin simply because they are so viscious in their constant attacks on her, and they're not limiting themselves to respectable topics either. Clearly, the Dems are concerned their candidate no longer has a leg to stand on, due to Palin's ability to excite the Conservative base of the Republican Party.<br>  <br>  No, they're attacking her family--gee, is anyone attacking Obama's family or Biden's family??? No. I say, a person's family has nothing to do with their ability to do their jobs appropriately.<br>  <br>  Plus, is anyone on the left concerned that Senator Obama's children won't be raised right if he's president? Doesn't HIS children need TWO PARENTS to raise them as well? Or do you consider it acceptable for a man to be president and not for a woman to be a VP?<br>  <br>  I would be more concerned if Palin's pregnant daughter was the type to kill her unborn child rather than have it and marry the child's father--like she's doing. Apparently, Palin's teenager is more responsible than the typical teenager who sleeps around, then murders the life inside her as if the child were some sort of cancer. That responsibility is thanks to her MOTHER, who has taught her to value life.<br>  <br>  Hhmmm, sounds like you Dems have double standards. You claim to be all for women breaking the "glass ceiling" but only if those women are far-left whackos. How about a "You Go, Girl!" for the chick, huh?<br>  <br>  As for myself, I don't vote for anyone based upon their race or their gender, but only upon the quality of their character, how they've handled their past jobs, and what they believe in--as well as what they're planning to do in the position they're running for.<br>  <br>  The fact that both McCain and Palin have said they're planning to overhaul the federal government to make it smaller, more efficient, and less wasteful of taxpayer dollars; tells me they would do a much better job than both Obama and Biden (whose ratings in the 2007 U.S. Senate Scorecard indicate they are not concerned with taxpayers much). Compare the Dem's ratings to McCain's ratings (100%) in the same document.<br>  <br>  If Senator Obama was a Conservative Christian Republican, I would be excited about HIM, and would vote for him.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately for him, Senator Obama has not had enough experience in government for my comfort. The fact that he has voted "present" in the Senate (over a hundred times) instead of "yea" or "nay" for or against any bills clearly indicates he either doesn't know how to vote "yea" or "nay," or he has extreme difficulty making decisions.<br>  <br>  Both of those problems cause me serious concern if this man wants to be president. The U.S. Presidency is not an "on-the-job-training" sort of position. It requires the ability to make serious decisions very quickly--something I trust Senator McCain to do far better than I would Senator Obama.<br>  <br>  So, instead of visciously attacking Sarah Palin, why don't you do some real research regarding your own Party's presidential candidates?|`|KAsFc13Baa	Well, how about the fact that she actually gets things done, and has done more than Obummer has??<br>  <br>  Palin’s accomplishments in Alaska dwarf Obama’s time in the Senate. She has killed pork barrel projects including the Bridge to Nowhere and passed ethics reform in Alaska that effectively ended the political career of many Republicans. She passed a constitutional ban on gay marriage but signed into law benefits for homosexual couples. And unlike the current Senate, has passed a budget in the amount of $6.6 billion that included several hundred cuts in wasteful programs, saving taxpayers over $200 million. <br>  <br>  Palin's popularity soared above 80% as she shelved pork-barrel projects by fellow Republicans and jump-started a campaign by her lieutenant governor, Sean Parnell, to unseat veteran U.S. Rep. Don Young of Alaska, who is now being investigated by the FBI. <br>  <br>  Ms. Palin has shown similar boldness in going after Big Oil, whose money has long dominated the state and helped fund its Republican machine. In a snub to the oil majors, she has proposed TransCanada Corp., a Calgary energy company, be given the primary contract to lead the $30 billion job to build a natural-gas pipeline from Alaska's North Slope.<br>  <br>  "Palin has accomplished a feat which has eluded the U.S. Congress for many years. She has pushed through the Alaska legislature a natural gas pipeline project which will bring new supply and price relief to the lower 48: <br>  |`|Pv9ALQfpaa	1) Personally I think some (not all) democrats are scared of her because she is a religious person... hence the reasons that there are some many lies going around about her being a witch hunter and that she is going to undermine Roe v. Wade... these accusations are totally unfounded and she has never tried to force her religion on the population while working for Alaska, why would she do it to the rest of the US population.... However I see that this is happening from the Republican side as well, against Obama... so it's not a one sided thing..<br>  <br>  2) I don't think she is victim per se... I think that she was on the defense... and I think anyone would be if they were perceived to be attacked by the questioner... both Gibson and Courics demeanor and body language suggested that they really didn't want to be interviewing her and they didn't care for her much and that would put anyone on the defense... And from my own personal experience it seems that when you are put on the defense like that and perfection (or near perfection) is expected of you that can cause you to stumble and then when you make mistakes and are attempting to correct them they can make a person even more nervous and stumble more than they usually would in normal circumstances.<br>  <br>  3) Honesly, I don't think she has that much foriegn experience but then neither does Obama really... The only ones that I feel has even remotely close to Foriegn experience is McCain and Biden... But that doesn't mean that Palin can't come into her own on Foriegn Policy... she is only the VP candidate and not the Presidential candidate.... so that doesn't bother me too much.<br>  <br>  4) I think that she will be able to dedicate as much time as needed for both. It seems that she has a loving husband that will help her in the parenting area. And really I don't see how her parenting skills are even relevent besides the fact that she is a woman... I feel that she would be able to do it just like any male that has been elected into that position... <br>  <br>  5) I haven't heard of this ochrastration that you are talking about in regards to the teens... I believe that they should be left alone however... they are going to have a rough time as it is... and I am not applauding that this has happened.. though I am applauding that she (and her boyfriend) are keeping the child however.... and anyone that thinks that Palin can't control her 17 year old daughter I just conclude that they have neither worked with teens nor have one of their own and do not realize that one cannot simply control a teenager... :/<br>  <br>  6) Honestly, I don't know why they are not allowing her out... As far as an article I read the other day McCain himself isn't too happy about it... it's some aides that are orchastrating that... and it's really annoying to most Republicans...<br>  <br>  7) I guess the same reason why most people that like her and agree with her are called extremist, uneducated and ignorant.... people like to belittle and name call... it's childish and has no basis... <br>  <br>  8) Personally, I think she is smarter than she is being given credit for... but who can really tell when she is in hiding and haven't been able to condition herself and prove herself to the people... <br>  <br>  As far as what I have done on my own as research into her, she is an intelligent and caring person and I think she could possibly do well for our country if given a good and decent chance to.... <br>  <br>  But like your opinion is opposite of mine and I respect that... this is my opinion of what I have seen and researched on my own..<br>  <br>  ADD: Wow... I am pretty sure no one called you sexist... just the view that she cannot be mother and politician at the same time... Um... her daughter that is pregnant is 17, which in most States could be and is considered an adult... so I am pretty sure that for the most part Bristol and Levi (with some help from family and friends) will do just fine on their own... they will just have to grow up pretty quickly... And their oldest has already flown out of the house... so technically they really only have to take care of 3 children full time which I think the two of them are fully capable of doing while she is a politician...<br>  <br>  And personally I think she has done a pretty good job being mom and politician if the only family problem they are having with 5 kids is a pregnant teenager since most families in this day and age can't even get off that lucky when mom is the breadwinner or that both parents are working...|`|jWSDenpUaa	That's a very long list and I agree with you on most...for those that say she's not running for President and that the Dem's should focus on McCain, I say that they are.  It's about McCain's judgment or lack there of.  <br>  <br>  Palin may be a great mother and a wonderful woman, but so is my mother and I wouldn't trust her to run this country.  McCain spent so little time vetting her.  Most companies spend more time interviewing for entry level positions than McCain did for the 2nd most important job in the world.<br>  <br>  It's a shame that for such an important position that she won't speak to the press.  She won't let the country know who she really is.  And when she speaks to the public, or misspeaks according to McCain, they claim she was only talking to a voter and called it a gotcha question.<br>  <br>  As for all her great work in Alaska, just remember how she got that budget and where that tax refund money came from...Taxing oil companies windfall profits...Sounds familiar, I think Obama had that idea once.|`|f1LpGpi5aa	No<br>  Because she has<br>  She doesn't- neither have any<br>  That isn't our concern- her family life is private-- how much time will Obama dedicate to his wife and children if he is elected?<br>  They aren't- the kids are getting married and shouldn't have to hide it just because you think it is a target to attack<br>  She can talk but she knows that the VP's job isn't to be out front<br>  Hillary was never elected to control the country- only to be a junior Senator from NY but I don't know anyone that wasn't attacked for speaking out against her. <br>  <br>  Finally, I believe she is the right PERSON for the job... her underwear doesn't play a part in the decision. She is the best of the four candidates- too bad she isn't on the top of the ticket.

AA11991365	Bar examinations in the United States are administered by government agencies of individual states, except for the patent bar, which is separately administered by the Office of Enrollment and Discipline of the United States Patent and Trademark Office.    In the United States, some states require bar association membership for all attorneys, while others do not.    Some state bar associations are operated by their respective state governments which make membership in their state's bar association a requirement to practice before that state's courts; such states are said to have a "mandatory" or "integrated bar."     In some places membership in a bar association is voluntary and in addition to any licensing that may be required by the state or the court system.|`|AA10515896	James is correct.    Most Bar Associations are run by the state, and membership is mandatory for any attorney who wants to be licensed to practice in that state. The fact that it is called an "Association" is not relevant. To practice law in those states, you must be a member of the bar, which is the same as being licensed by the state. That is why it is called an "integrated" bar.    Even those states that do not have an integrated bar still requires licensure through the state. In almost every state, the requirements are pretty much the same. Go to law school, graduate with a doctoral (professional) degree in law (JD), then take the state bar exam and the professional responsibility (ethics) exam. If you pass both, and if you meet the requirements for moral character review, then you may be licensed by the state. And almost every state requires state licensure to be able to practice law.    Lawyers may also join "private clubs" (county bar associations, non-integrated state bars, National Lawyers Guild, American Bar Association, etc.) but those private organizations do not provide licensure.|`|AA10914642	Each state licenses an attorney in the same way that physicians and others receive a state license.  You are confusing this with the various county and state "bar" associations which are actually unions just like the AMA is actually a union.  You can practice as an attorney or a physician after passing the licensing requirements and you do not have to join the "union" (any of the state and local bar associations)|`|AA11909142	I am not sure where you are or what your state's rules are, but Lawyers are licensed by the state.  In most states it's called the State Bar and lawyers have to take tests and pass and then can only practice law if they have that license (just like Drs.) and are bound by ethical obligations etc. and can lose their license if they don't comply with those rules.    Judges are a little different, they are elected officials (except federal judges who are in a whole different category).  Judges can be appointed by a governor, but will have to run for election (either in 4 or 6 years depending on where you are).  There are judicial councils which also keep an eye on the judges and can censure them etc. but that is made up of judges so I don't know if that is what you mean.    Bottom line, I don't think you have the right information (and trust me, don't trust Grisham novels for the ways lawyers do or don't do things in real life), but if I have missed something in your question or if where you are the state doesn't license attorneys let me know.|`|AA10091182	Well, Grim above is right.  But the real reason is that we made the rules.  That's right, the overwhelmong majority of legislators are lawyers and the ones who aren't have lawyers advising them.  Our game. our rules.  You don't like it?  Tough on you.    However, all states have procedures for people to complain about the conduct of a lawyer, for reviews of attorney and judicial conduct, and for removing lawyers and judges who violate those rules.  So, I don't know exactly what you think we're getting away with.
AA11813866	Liberal = hypocrite. They don't care about any other issues but their own. They only give lip service to freedom and individual rights as long as it serves their own agenda. People like John Kerry and Teddy Kennedy talk about taxing the rich. Wha?? They are both billionaires!!!! And best of all, they are exempt from all the crazy laws and taxes they want to pass. The bottom line is that most liberal thought is female inspired thought which, as unpopular as this might sound, is fundamentally illogical. Sometimes they have a good idea or two but most of their ideas don't hold water.

In other words, one can advocate freedom of speech and also be passionate about opposing another's political ideas.    Now, if the so-called liberal were to advocate that you should not even have the right to express your conservative ideas, then that would be un-American and contrary to the freedom of speech in the First Amend. to the U.S. Const.|`|AA10249209	I have heard more bigoted conservatives in here then liberals. I think you have a right to say what you did, I just think it is wrong. I will tell you why I think it is wrong and you can either except it or argue you point and at the end the only thing that we will agree on is to disagree.|`|AA10210288	Maybe because conservatives like you are preaching the benefits of learning English while not being able to talk it themselves.|`|AA10230813	Because liberals think they are smarter than the rest of the world.  But in truth liberalism is a mental disorder.|`|AA11974064	None of our politicians or political parties want to have anyone question their views.  For too long their constituents simply voted along party lines instead of actually listening and evaluating what they say. And what they say means thru actions as well as verbally.    Whenever someone questions them, they will become defensive mainly because what they are doing is not in the best interest of those they represent.  This applies to conservatives, liberals, moderates or whatever you may consider yourself to be.    By the tone of your question it appears you consider yourself a conservative.  Before blasting any opposing position, take a close look at what is being said on both sides and evaluate whether it makes sense or not.  You will find that many of the issues being debated do not matter in the grand scheme of things.|`|AA12146373	1.all democrats aren't the same therefore that statement is inaccurate.  2.I don't think only "democrats" do that  3.People with strong opinions tend to do that regardless of their political stance...i call them idiots|`|AA11314617	Hard to answer this one, since you aren't being altogether specific.

046473fd7f160fe7a30e657aa5faaf75aa	TRUE.  <br>  <br>  Palin went from Alaskan bobble-head Barbie to retrofitted stepford wife last night.  An even more insulting a persona than what she previously offered the American voting public.  Anyone with the ability to hear and think coherently knows she dogged the topics almost without exception.  <br>  <br>  The Republicans wound her up and sent her toddling onstage with a head full of stock answers and campaign talking points.  I knew the minute I heard her ask if she could call Senator Biden Joe that she would have a stupid one-liner to spout.  What surprised me is she actually found a segue that was not too clumsy in which to use it.  <br>  <br>  All the debate proved was the woman is out of her league and McSame has nothing to offer us but distractions. Palin has served her purpose much like the mechanical dolls Bugs Bunny often sent waddling up to Elmer Fudd or Daffy Duck.  After engaging with the eye candy for a moment they always ended up getting blasted.  McCain is employing the same cartoon-like tactic hoping that people will be racist enough to put Bush back into the White House wearing a McCain bodysuit.  <br>  <br>  |`|1edb7e285e1837d108c2caf03520c8bbaa	True. She never answered a question, she just kept reciting a speech that was written for her. It was bizarre.|`|q5m9g1yWaa	You missed the winking.|`|nwnILcEAaa	True. Gwen should have smacked her hand|`|MiB5fhePaa	And of course, because the moderator was under pressure not to appear biased, she couldn't insist that Palin stick to the question.  That would have produced howls of protests from Republicans who were lining up to declare that the debate was somehow unfair.<br>  <br>  The moderator should have said, "You can say whatever you want, but if you just ignore my questions and Biden's statements, then you're not engaging in a debate, you're just making alternating speeches."|`|JXqoWGhraa	True PAlin is an idiot she proved it to america last night and while she was throwing corny jokes at Biden i was laughing for her greatest stupidity. People take your eyes and get check is taht someone u want in the vice seat, i mean come on all i heard last night was alaska this alaska taht i mean no harm but alaska is one part of the country what aboout everyone else?|`|edwaWk05aa	The debate was a travesty. Imagine pulling that stuff in school?<br>  <br>  Q: What is 6x6?<br>  <br>  A: Math is very important and we need to increase funding in our schools for math and science. |`|Rh2ge7ajaa	TRUE|`|n66Zq4Wiaa	True|`|vObP9iYUaa	True|`|ngHnzkS8aa	Ha - pretty much. Check out this Palin Debate Flow Chart:<br>  <br>  |`|fee09b5e3d149771de1ec09bd9c174d0aa	Pretty close to it.|`|FTjiau4Gaa	I would agree with that. It seemed like she was a little rehearsed, and was told while prepping for the debate "if you don't know the answer focus on your strengths" or "focus negatively on Obama. I understand that logic, but still would have like the questions answered.|`|8826af91a1a8af16c8350ffa918c8844aa	I am happy to see I was not the only one who had the perceived notion that this woman is a manipulating moron!...<br>  <br>  I honestly do not understand what all the hype is about, how it is that she connects with the common American..I know Americans are smarter than that...people this is not about a liberal and or a conservative issue, its about the facts, the woman is an embarrassment to our country..the fact that McCain appointed her as the VP leads me to question his ability to run this country...God Help us if this were to happen!|`|COTdefejaa	yep i was watching and i was like... seriously? you're going to avoid question you can't answer and pretend like you're going to "talk about something more important"<br>  <br>  and she kept bringing up alaska!! it was getting annoying|`|wAiQOP0Laa	Pretty much.  She only had a limited number of predetermined responses after all.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	A very good synopsis.|`|tLPv8Vvuaa	Nope, I'm guessing you also believed Bill Clinton when he said he was the first black president...|`|nG4iNdkpaa	Too True!!!! |`|MhyuXBoEaa	Exactly how it went...lol|`|4fqx40dwaa	thats was it in a nutshell|`|AqZvhJMJaa	True very true.  I noticed Sarah looking down a whole lot when Biden was answering questions.  That made it obvious that she was using a script.  Biden was the one that actually answered the questions with his mind not some paper.|`|YupMCYHlaa	Yes, I got the same impression.  Actually, over the years, most presidential and VP debates have gone like this.  Each candidate learns a 1-minute speech about each issue, and any question about that issue is answered with this general one-minute speech, not just in debates but in interviews.<br>  <br>  This year I was surprised that the Obama/McCain debate didn't go that way.  Both of them answered questions directly and it was a good debate.<br>  <br>  But in this debate, Palin used that old strategy.  The 'GOP Charm School' had taught her these little monologues and she used them for almost every question.  Every answer was very general, about general policy rather than the actual answer to the question.   And often, like Bush, when there were two questions in the same general area, she'd repeat the same speech twice.<br>  
AA11963685	She did what she had to do in order not to appear as clueless as she has in the last two weeks.  McCain's camp has been schooling her for hours a day in anticipation of this debate, and it showed.  It showed that she is great at memorization and she has a natural talent for misdirection.  She is aggressive enough to be able to "turn" the questions in the direction she needed to and to just ignore the question entirely when she knew she couldn't answer it.  She would just jump into reciting something she had memorized and practiced for hours and it showed.  She did what she had to do in order not to hurt her or McCain's campaign.  Although looking at the polling of the uncommitted voters last night, it seems she did hurt McCain.  Those who decided last night chose Obama 2 to 1 over McCain.  That qualifies as hurting his campaign in a very real way.  But the Republicans are giddy today that she didn't really muck things up.  That's sort of pathetic isn't it?|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	Often, it's better to not answer a question, than to risk political vulnerability later. Anybody with any tactical understanding whatsoever knows this.<br>  <br>  In the form of a proverb -- It's better to remain silent, and have people believe you're ignorant, than to open your mouth and remove all doubt.<br>  <br>  Addendum: You're on an answers board. Why don't you answer every question you see?|`|qYZ2QFlbaa	Yeah.....there's a time and a place for a speech, the debate isn't one of them....<br>  <br>  I knew she'd do it tho. She's never been a straight shooter.|`|OAnyhXDVaa	correct<br>  and sarah palin did a lot of question dodging she way too scripted|`|UHj6U2tcaa	Failin refused to answer the questions because they didn't fit the "answers" she had rehearsed. This shows complete disrespect for the debate process. You're not talking to your yokels in your small town hall, this is the world. <br>  She just wanted to win the yokels by being all purty like and saying cute little words like "doggone it". I'm surprised she didn't pop open a cold brewsky at the end, yee haw!!!<br>  LMAO!<br>  <br>  <br>  '08AMA!|`|b1w5FUGzaa	Exactly !  It's funny how so many "political experts on tv" are saying that Palin nailed it last night...lol what debate were they watching?  The average american thinks that Palin did horrible last night.|`|AA11917018	 I completely agree ! Biden should have called in sick then he wouldn't he misquoted the Constitution!! To think people would vote for this guys ticket.. |`|kY0EMbfEaa	I agree, Obama should have stayed home, and so should have Biden!|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	So every one can see how gosh darned cute you look in that shade of lipstick, and get extra credit in English class.|`|suRNfSS8aa	<br>  i agree ..biden should have not did that|`|bY7G2rRcaa	For the cake and donuts afterwards.|`|ee08b687b5ca665f680a54a91f18d5deaa	"I'm going to talk directly to the people instead."  I was glad I had boots on when she said that.|`|UIpExpKCaa	serious, what was biden thinking, wasting all our time like that. If he wants to get serious about being vp he needs to bring is A game to a debate. |`|ApFh12Sqaa	yea but the VP debate doesnt hold much weight in the election unless they stray off the path of the Pres. Nominee|`|ohzPenCWaa	She's a maverick... that's what mavericks do
01669e8c4403fe7fd458f8bdcb56e56aaa	Yeah.  Something like that.  He was trying to be polite... he was a bit off putting at the end of the 2nd debate.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Yes, he appeared to be sincerely cordial.  Why?|`|WOw84q5Laa	It appeared that way, yes|`|tDZMJue9aa	yes i believe he did..and the thing is what did you want him to say..wow you sucked...thanks man you made me look great...and you do realize again im not bush right...
kZ1xpArnaa	i think he was talking about an attack on our soil or one of our allies. IF obama go elected, Our "Enemies" would want to know how much they could get away with. If he lets them off with a "slap on the wrist" or if he launches a counter-attack (which would be against everything he preaches). It would be a VERY tough situation for him. |`|d056344a206c7d51bc2f1a5e8ea289d2aa	Not just Obama, McCain too.<br>  <br>  He thinks (and so does the Pentagon), something will happen to the country after the election. <br>  <br>  I thought Fidel retired and his brother is running Cuba.|`|yjBPsN90aa	Look up Neville Chamberlain, that will tell you everything you need to know|`|FTs2py0kaa	russia invading another country................middle eastern country taking American hostages,,,,,,,,,,,it goes on......|`|2P18wyECaa	Well Fidel Castro seems to want Obama elected.....It wouldn't suprise me if he tries something right out the gate.<br>  <br>  Bush made people hate us...<br>  <br>  and now Obama's gonna bend over and they take their "revenge" WTG voters.
7IjGzvqTaa	Also, some town-based stores around certain areas have one.  For example, we have a grocery store called "Dillon's" (dunno where you are so dunno if you have one), but they have a notary public there.|`|XoAwzQ5Yaa	Town halls, sometimes police stations or sheriffs departments, and of course, the good ol' yellow pages. |`|niD66AbCaa	I dunno I always go to my bank and since I'm a customer it's always free. I bank at WAMU. |`|BhX5Mj6jaa	Well, you can go to the library to get a notary public to notarize for you for free. I go to the library when I have to get something notarize and liquor stores can do that here I don't know about if they do it where your from?<br>  <br>  |`|YEF3421Gaa	Lawyers office, some Chamber of Commerces at their office have a notary public, banks.|`|xiA5Iu5Saa	Some libraries. 
392fb9fe3924e0ea502b517efe20098daa	Each state is different, but generally contracts are not enforceable unless a signed document can be verified.  However, you did give them you debit card number which does imply your approval.  It is best to ask a lawyer in your state.  Meanwhile, do not pay.  What are they going to do.  Change you debit card number now.  They are probably just strong arming you.  As a reminder, do not listen to phone sales in the future.  Hang up.  Legitimate sales companies do not use phone sales.  All phone sales are high pressure.  It is successful for companies because they catch so many people off guard.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	You entered into an agreement the moment you gave them your banking  information.|`|RRFbDou9aa	Yes, they can do that.  You gave them your number and told them it was ok.
CmG8oTH0aa	The crazy thing is that they have a higher GNP than Spain and South Korea and yet we don't give them financial aide.<br>  <br>  I like Israel, but they seem to have enough money, isn't it time we spent some money on Americans?<br>  <br>  As anyone seen their Government funded building projects?<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:  for those who think its about Military expenditures, get a grip.  Israel spends more than 25 times what we give them in aide on buying American weapons.  <br>  <br>  Our aide to them was paramount when they were a new democracy without the means or the population to support themselves.  But that is no longer the case.<br>  <br>  <br>  Come on.  I like Israel, but they just piss our money away, because they don't need it.|`|sQsl1r5Yaa	It's an investment in our ally in the Middle East.|`|35388c245298f734c446f07410c4ec69aa	Of course it can.  Wealth went from one place to another, that's the definition of redistribution.  However the phrase 'redistribution of wealth' is typically used in a narrower context, so it might be a little misleading to apply it in this instance.|`|9L3nbXl4aa	Are you against Israel? I shudder to think what would happen if we lost our only true friend and ally in the middle east.|`|04c6f0020d54d895d5df2d20e39d5fb7aa	lol yes pretty much lol.|`|Jwd5uIVwaa	No.|`|8MUkunBiaa	No it can be defined as military expenditures to lower the level of terrorism in the world.  You don't realize that the vast majority of the money we give to Israel is given back to us in the form of military purchases so they buy our weapons and defend their country along with the free world.  They sacrifice their blood, sons and daughters fighting on the front line of Democracy.  This is money well spent by the free world.|`|OYgtlTEfaa	No , that what we pay them to be our eyes and ears, and our first line of defense in the Middle East.<br>  <br>  We give a lot more to countries that would slit our throats in the dead of night if they thought they could get away with it.|`|FaBiF6MNaa	Don't worry, when Obama gets into power, he will cut that off...... and give it to Libya, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria. He'll probably throw some to North Korea as well.|`|3BM7KC06aa	Nope it's consider a tax incentive based on the conservative.|`|dAbAKLcTaa	They only call it socialism if Obama is involved. They heard it on FOX and now they wont shut up about it|`|RgMt0JkHaa	The congress approves the budget, blame lies with them, ALL OF THEM. |`|IMSkR8Ajaa	NO.|`|vsGsBpYUaa	Nope!|`|dZeZBjJEaa	Why pick Israel?  We have given much more to South Africa, and then Nelson Mandela turns around and says how horrible the U.S. is. If we are so mean, then please return the billions we have given you in aid. At least Israel is our ally and friend.  But I agree with your overall potential point that foreign aid should be reduced.  |`|d4frm3MMaa	In a manner of speaking, yes. Whenever the government takes the wealth of its citizens and moves it somewhere else, it's redistributing wealth. |`|yGcUOx9Uaa	To "Lily K", yes I am.  We do not need to continue sending billions of dollars to Israel.  We could use this money within our own country.  We the people, for the people should NOT translate to Israel.  |`|B4KM95Wzaa	How long have you been an anti-semite?<br>  <br>  Do you have any swastika tattoos?|`|HEsfhQPvaa	So, are you an actual card carrying member of the nazi party?|`|8AYVU9Fcaa	YES.

W3NY2E5daa	Both Obama and Biden keep saying over and over the McCain will be another 4 years of Bush yet during the VP debate Biden openly admitted that he does not not what McCain's stance is on several issues. So can Obama and Biden claim McCain will be just like Bush when they don't know all the facts?<br>  <br>  As far as differences I think McCain wants to go further then Bush did in regards to cutting business taxes and personal taxes. He also wants more troops for Iraq then Bush did. McCain wants to do more in regards to alternative energy.<br>  <br>  Added: Sydney, are you even paying any attention to the news or what? The McCain camp has been talking about natural gas, wind, and solar for a while now. But a lot of it will take time so their short term fix to help get us off foreign sources of oil is to drill for it within our own borders.|`|S9ud9hqyaa	McCain is a MAVERICK!!|`|lRFkow1Raa	global warming, the amount of troops in Iraq, torture methods, campaign reform laws.|`|ukWvyRU8aa	they'lll get angry because there is no difference, he's voted with GW 90 percent of the time, so it'lll be more of the same and worse, look at the effects of a repub. presidency and you'll see the state of your country, vote for CHANGE!!|`|ss0vy4tFaa	a world of difference, bush have so much to learn about the world, mccain knows the world a lot better than most americans. |`|IuSfCtN9aa	bush chose a qualified vp while mccain chose a unqualified vp.|`|17feb47071a2377dd053f9a72daff9dbaa	Bush and McCain are the same and they both are going to lose in November.|`|3LpNLdauaa	McCain has a different view on torture than Bush Jr.<br>  <br>  McCain picked a VP that he'll have to teach everything in case she needed to take over. Bush picked a VP who could just take over, even while the elected guy was still sitting behind the desk.<br>  <br>  McCain's wife owns a brewery.<br>  <br>  Bush's dad was another President, McCain's dad was an Admiral.<br>  <br>  Bush almost choked to death on a pretzel.<br>  McCain could either choke in November or die in office...no pretzel needed.|`|va0hLYI6aa	The talking point that "McCain voted with George W 90% of the time" (sometimes it's 95% sometimes it's 93%, apparently the liberal elite can't come to a conclusion) is absolutely hilarious. Senator Obama voted with President Bush the majority of the time too. Why? Because most of the things they vote for in the Senate are absolutely worthless.<br>  <br>  "Do you support December 4th being National Sesame Street Appreciation Day? All those in favor, say I. *I*. Motion carries." That's the Senate, in a nutshell.<br>  <br>  Pres. Bush has presided over one of the largest governmental control increases in US history. Sen. McCain does not support "big government" unlike Sen. Obama who will seek to socialize most programs including most notably, healthcare. So, in actuality, Obama & Bush are more similar than Bush and McCain.<br>  <br>  Huh, it's funny what happens when you rely on facts instead of media talking points... you get to the truth.|`|E7zDg0nVaa	nope...McCain is essentially the same as Bush...how scary is that..just what we need another 4 years of this mess we call a economy.<br>  and Ruppster...alternative energy...did i miss something? honestly because i am hearing very little alternative energy and a lot of offshore drilling...great just what we need!|`|AA10469398	Not as far as I can tell.

No threats or suspicion of foul play necessary, his current health condition is enough to inspire a lively betting pool.|`|MfKWHH4Naa	All I'm going to say is this...8 years ago America decided that Bush was BETTER to lead our country than McCain.

Well, I personally would vote for Obama because I think the McCain team is just too old and has a bit out of there vice presidential pick. I think I would start fearing if McCain was picked. I don't think I can fully trust Sarah Palin to run the country if Mr. 75 or something dies. I don't know.... |`|Bk0cb9rcaa	I'm with you on this one.  Neither candidate looks remotely good.

98hu2yCUaa	You shouldn't have posted that, they are going to find you!! JK<br>  <br>  I agree very much so. We need to vote out the incumbents and vote in some new people. unfortunately, The majority of this country will not vote for a third party candidate because they have already bought into the two party system and have chosen a side and only think narrow minded. So, we have to assume the worst, hope for the best, and choose the better smelling turd. At least McCain is willing to vote against his party on many issues whereas Obama is a suck up and follows Pelosi. I think I know which turd smells better.<br>  <br>  This isn't some stupid conspiracy like 9/11 either. This is real and we are going to be screwed if we don't get rid of all of them. Both parties created this economic crisis with over regulation and under regulation and now they are acting like our saviors so they don't lose their jobs. Hopefully I am wrong and the majority of Americans aren't dumb enough to follow like sheep to the slaughter.<br>  <br>  I think I answered your question. |`|SXeEvt9Qaa	so don't vote.|`|QylWVl6aaa	the bailout didnt pass so it looks like they dont have much power at all.

But it all rests on how congress writes this bill.<br>  <br>  If nothing happens... this country will be further down in deep sh*t.<br>  I have to disagree with the foreign policy.  they don't all agree on it.

It is all about the party and who can screw the other guy. Every representitive is supposed to represent his people and not their political party. Take a look at the presidential bull crap. Why would anyone take on a presidential job that makes around $400,000 a year and spend 10's of millions of dollars just to get the presidential position. Where in the heck are they going to make up all that money they spent???? Maybe fraud, stealing from the people, un-ethical corruption, etc... Pelosi, Obama, Biden are total nut cases that only think about what is best for themselves and their party. Maybe it is time to get rid of all the cranky OLD men and women in politics that need to retire and move on.|`|2d3337cd8ceb8e126b69b3b1d37a1ec1aa	Exactly what IS going on, that's what people want to know.  Okay we need some kind of a bail out program, but no one, not GW, not Congress, not our presidential candidates, not even the genius economists can explain coherently to the average taxpayer what the plan entails.  How will it effect me and you in the long haul?  How can Exxon make millions in profits, but somehow this is all blamed on the housing bubble, greed, bi-partisianships, and insurance companies?  I'd love to sit on the bleachers and see what's really going on, but the damn field is too foggy!|`|frsxYjsKaa	I just read the first line and this is what I have to say....Obama and McCain both agree because disagreeing right now is a risk that could cost them the election! Why would any candidate disagree with the president, let alone their own party! Shows that the candidate doesn't want what Bush says is best and everyone is so MEDIA driven. A lot of people do not research candidates and just go by what they see on TV...candidates do not want to risk that! Understandable...Just do your research and you can tell if they really support it or not! I know who does and doesn't.<br>  <br>  EDIT...the other above me are right too. They agree, so what! They are Dem and Rep....whats your point?

Wealthy people don't care about socialism or capitalism, all that matters is exploitation, as long as the retain their elitist lifestyles on the backs of the working class.<br>  <br>  They could care less about patriotism to, except in cases where the working class thinks it is patriotic to help them maintain their elitist pseudo-monarch status.<br>  China is less communist than it used to be as mentioned above. But is also more fascist than it used to be.<br>  the communist central bank is still the government regardless of what anone wants to admit, and that is what Bush and his cronies has in mind for America.<br>  <br>  Corporatist bootlickers like to blame unions, but unions have been nearly extinct since the 90s, and so have permenent American jobs as temp services even gobble up jobs that require advanced degrees.<br>  We could reduce business taxes to 0 and they still won't come back unless we are willing to work for $2.50 a day while subsidizing their manufacturing costs, so they are pretty much just making their products for free, and collecting profit.<br>  <br>  Anyone want to work for $2.50 a day?|`|4fqaQRnIaa	Yeah, pretty silly isn't it.  Greed hath no bounds.<br>  <br>  "let not ask what your country can do for you; ask what you can do for your country." (or there abouts)<br>  <br>  I guess this applies not to our corporation.<br>  <br>  Because of regulations our companies are not allowed to pollute freely as they do in Mexico, China, India etc.<br>  <br>  Because of better wages our citizens can afford good things.  But with the loss of these jobs we get cheap toys with lead pollutants, cheap electronics, milk products that are poisoned and we lose tax money that go right back to the super rich.  Globalization?|`|auJiPMAmaa	My company is an outsorcing company.  We have plants in the US, Mexico & India.

Well , John McCAin wants to keep job in the U.S. once he'll become a President!|`|6J899sxpaa	Well, a large part of it is due to cheap labor. But most US citizens can recognize that China is pretty much just pretending to be Communist, they actually practice a very radical form of Capitalism.|`|6k6wofD2aa	We have many socialistic qualities in our own form of government.

They need to be voting on a bill because of the details, not because of some speech. To do otherwise is childish an immature.|`|aacfd8fefffdd38954d160d7caee8f91aa	The taxpayer should not have this bailout forced upon them.  Even many democrats agree that the tax payer shouldn't be forced to bail out Washington.  <br>  <br>  The government tried to socially enginer wealth by controlling banks and everyone bought into the philosophy of instant gratification.  And now now like a house built on a bad foundation the whole thing is crumbling.  And the only answer we're getting from the government is to keep piling on top of that foundation.  <br>  <br>  America first will come up with a solution that doesn't involve taking tax payer money.  |`|G59cfwwIaa	It wasn't Pelosi's comments.  That's just an excuse.  The Republicans are just afraid to vote for it because all of them are up for re-election in 5 weeks and the bailout bill is quite unpopular with their conservative constituents. <br>  They are worried about their seats in congress, not the economy.|`|5cLZlX30aa	40% of democrats voted against the bill.  I'd like to drop kick the whole lot of them off a cliff or off the end of the pier.  Democrats and republicans.  Pelosi at the front of the line.|`|kOvAy4t0aa	Democrats could have passed the bill alone.  Don't be stupid.  They wanted the majority of the votes to come from Republicans then they could blame them if it didn't work.  |`|EoCS4Yxxaa	why do you make things complicated ??? they voted agaisnt it cause they think its wrong......theres nothing wrong with that...|`|tVegdpmjaa	It was a vote "Country first" and not for the wealthy and  corrupt friends of the Dem's elite.|`|y5kqAmxraa	On MSNBC this week, Newsweek's Jonathan Alter tried to connect John McCain to the current financial disaster, saying: "If you remember the Keating Five scandal that (McCain) was a part of. ... He's really getting a free ride on the fact that he was in the middle of the last great financial scandal in our country."<br>  <br>  McCain was "in the middle of" the Keating Five case in the sense that he was "exonerated." The lawyer for the Senate Ethics Committee wanted McCain removed from the investigation altogether, but, as The New York Times reported: "Sen. McCain was the only Republican embroiled in the affair, and Democrats on the panel would not release him."<br>  <br>  So John McCain has been held hostage by both the Viet Cong and the Democrats.<br>  <br>  Alter couldn't be expected to know that: As usual, he was lifting material directly from Kausfiles. What is unusual was that he was stealing a random thought sent in by Kausfiles' mother, who, the day before, had e-mailed: "It's time to bring up the Keating Five. Let McCain explain that scandal away."<br>  <br>  The Senate Ethics Committee lawyer who investigated McCain already had explained that scandal away -- repeatedly. It was celebrated lawyer Robert Bennett, most famous for defending a certain horny hick president a few years ago.<br>  <br>  In February this year, on Fox News' "Hannity and Colmes," Bennett said, for the eight billionth time:<br>  <br>  "First, I should tell your listeners I'm a registered Democrat, so I'm not on (McCain's) side of a lot of issues. But I investigated John McCain for a year and a half, at least, when I was special counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee in the Keating Five. ... And if there is one thing I am absolutely confident of, it is John McCain is an honest man. I recommended to the Senate Ethics Committee that he be cut out of the case, that there was no evidence against him."<br>  <br>  It's bad enough for Alter to be constantly ripping off Kausfiles. Now he's so devoid of his own ideas, he's ripping off the idle musings of Kausfiles' mother.<br>  <br>  Even if McCain had been implicated in the Keating Five scandal -- and he wasn't -- that would still have absolutely nothing to do with the subprime mortgage crisis currently roiling the financial markets. This crisis was caused by political correctness being forced on the mortgage lending industry in the Clinton era.<br>  <br>  Before the Democrats' affirmative action lending policies became an embarrassment, the Los Angeles Times reported that, starting in 1992, a majority-Democratic Congress "mandated that Fannie and Freddie increase their purchases of mortgages for low-income and medium-income borrowers. Operating under that requirement, Fannie Mae, in particular, has been aggressive and creative in stimulating minority gains."<br>  <br>  Under Clinton, the entire federal government put massive pressure on banks to grant more mortgages to the poor and minorities. Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, investigated Fannie Mae for racial discrimination and proposed that 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers by the year 2001.<br>  <br>  Instead of looking at "outdated criteria," such as the mortgage applicant's credit history and ability to make a down payment, banks were encouraged to consider nontraditional measures of credit-worthiness, such as having a good jump shot or having a missing child named "Caylee."<br>  <br>  Threatening lawsuits, Clinton's Federal Reserve demanded that banks treat welfare payments and unemployment benefits as valid income sources to qualify for a mortgage. That isn't a joke -- it's a fact.<br>  <br>  When Democrats controlled both the executive and legislative branches, political correctness was given a veto over sound business practices.<br>  <br>  In 1999, liberals were bragging about extending affirmative action to the financial sector. Los Angeles Times reporter Ron Brownstein hailed the Clinton administration's affirmative action lending policies as one of the "hidden success stories" of the Clinton administration, saying that "black and Latino homeownership has surged to the highest level ever recorded."<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, economists were screaming from the rooftops that the Democrats were forcing mortgage lenders to issue loans that would fail the moment the housing market slowed and deadbeat borrowers couldn't get out of their loans by selling their houses.<br>  <br>  A decade later, the housing bubble burst and, as predicted, food-stamp-backed mortgages collapsed. Democrats set an affirmative action time-bomb and now it's gone off.<br>  <br>  In Bush's first year in office, the White House chief economist, N. Gregory Mankiw, warned that the government's "implicit subsidy" of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, combined with loans to unqualified borrowers, was creating a huge risk for the entire financial system.<br>  <br>  Rep. Barney Frank denounced Mankiw, saying he had no "concern about housing." How dare you oppose suicidal loans to people who can't repay them! |`|RExaPGMgaa	you are wrong. martial law was declared by nacy pelosi and republican s were not allowed to speak. there voices were not heard and it is a complete unlawful takeover of the house by democrats. the vote was by a majority democrats who decided to make their own plan completely deifferent from the original bailout plan that was 15 pages and is now 110. democrats are working for a new world order and they have ordered more currency printed which has destroyed the us dollar and moving to an amero.|`|zcqvFZF6aa	It was their **** first! If this was November 05, 2008 they would have voted for it, but because these Republicans stand for re-election and Americans are pissed they know that to vote FOR the bailout would be suicide for their political lives, same thing happened in forcing the Dem's to vote for the use of force in Iraq back in 2002.|`|WAwPdO0qaa	Yeah.. its funny how the bill was proposed by a republican administration..

I think they voted against it because so many of their constituents did not support it. There was no public review of the law, so very few people even knew what it said. Many republicans do not like the idea of, in essence, nationalizing the home mortgage industry. And we certainly did not want to reward high level executives who made bad business decisions without any consequences to either themselves or their companies.<br>  <br>  Pelosi's comments were just the last straw.<br>  <br>  By the way, it was the democrats that stopped this bill. They had enough votes to pass it without the republicans and Pelosi could not even deliver her own caucus.|`|vIO2jWu9aa	and they aren't supposed to listen to the 100s of 1000s of angry phone calls that indicated voters were against the bailout?  What about the chicken democraps that sided with Naxi Pelosi - were they listening to the voters? Remember that 40% voted no.<br>  <br>  I think the House reps that voted no are good examples of "America First." Barry doesn't have a clue since he promises to raise taxes on the small businesses that earn over $250k per year.|`|AA10652652	It's actually a two prong attack.  <br>  <br>  #1<br>  During the meeting that McCain and Obama went to became a shouting match.  To score political points, the Democrats had Obama chair the meeting.  The first words out of Obama's mouth were an attack on the Republican plan that he never saw.  The meeting self destructed after that.<br>  <br>  #2<br>  The House has a Democratic majority.  95 something Democrats voted against the bill.  Now even if Obama attacked the other party, he still couldn't get his own party to vote on the bill.  If Obama could have done that, then the bill would have passed.  After all, Obama is the Democrats' leader.<br>  <br>  McCain was spending his time on the phone trying to get votes. There were already 7 votes and he got 58 more votes.  Obama was busy running for president.  Although Obama couldn't vote in the House, he didn't bother to stir up support for the bill he supported.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	The republicans don't like socialist BS to begin with.

So, I warned you.<br>  <br>  I cannot, based on the Word of God, vote for a man who supports gay rights (go to obama's website and read the letter of endorsement from Obama to LGBT organization--<a href="http://pride.barackobama.com/page/content/lgbthome--scroll" rel="nofollow">http://pride.barackobama.com/page/conten...</a> down and click on "Open Letter from Barack Obama" . I cannot vote for a man who supports partial-birth abortions and the right of juveniles to NOT require parental signatures for an abortion. Our schools cannot give children a Tylenol without parental (and sometimes medical) permission; yet Obama wants to let them have abortions.<br>  <br>  It doesn't have anything to do with black, white, male or female, it has to do with MY walk with Jesus and how can I look God in the face on judgment day and give a valid reason for voting for a man who goes against God's Word. <br>  <br>  I don't necessarily agree with EVERYTHING McCain says, but I do agree with his moral issues and, as a CHRISTIAN, I must look at morals before I look at policy. <br>  <br>  You want to know why this world is going to hell, look at where people are focused. People are making their decisions on who to vote for based on money, status, good looks, popularity, good speaking voice instead of looking to God.<br>  <br>  If you are not a Christian and you read this and you were offended,  I am sorry. If you are a Christian and you read this and you were offended, then I am really sorry; however, if you call yourself a child of God and vote for Obama, you are only hurting your own testimony.

The best health care is in the US.  Look at Canada & the UK's health care systems.  People in the UK pull their own teeth because it's so diffilcult to get to see the health care dentists.  Canadians die before seeing a doctor if you have cancer.  By the time someone qualified examines you you have progressed from having treatable cancer to having terminal cancer.  Look at the taxes paid for supposed free health care.  The burdon for a broken system is rediculous.  I know a Doctor that runs a large medical office in Canada and the people they have to hire today are idiots in relation to the quality of doctors of the past.  If you don't pay people in the medical profession then the best and brightest will choose other professions.  Simple economics.  Everyone in Canada has a doctor in the US in case they actually get sick.  For routine items or things that aren't time sensative they go to thier canadian doctor though for anything important they come to the US.  I don't know as many people in the UK though the one few UK citizens I know through business also go to US doctors and their UK plan pays for this so they are very happy.  They get excellent service from an actual doctor in an almost immediate fashion and the people of the UK pay for it through taxation.|`|092bea1320ac52f2f7cd0e47cb63f9e5aa	well I think they got a bit confused about that old saying you know "carrot and a stick" maybe they dont think they need a health service without a need for a health service.... so now you now the way an american thinks... think of a goal... achieve the goal...then fix the problems.... much like most human thought really... no one thinks before they jump anymore!|`|Tf0w18BDaa	Well, if I'm being attacked by a street gang and without a firearm for defense, my health will soon equal zero anyway.<br>  <br>  Now, I don't mind the public healthcare as long as it does not degenerate into waiting four hours in a hallway to see a doctor or waiting 6 months to get an appointment.  <br>  <br>  But I'm not giving up my firearms freedom to the federal (or any) government.

He has the power to indefinitely postpone the presidential election, too. Did you know that? All he needs is a qualified excuse such as war or an attack on the United States (see recent news about bin Laden threats for October 2008).|`|l02Huqdlaa	Most people would know you don't do these kinds of things in election years and during war.

I also think there was a feeling among the Democrats that they were above such tactics, especially when the impeachment trial of Bill Clinton was so blatantly political.  It is probably better to just let George Bush go in the interest of political unity.  Besides, there's always the World Court in The Hague.  Maybe they can get Bush and Cheney as a war criminals once they're out of office.  It's okay with me.|`|0db7dfe907b8101041f1b50d64e06e6baa	Because all of their anti-Bush rhetoric is as phony as professional wrestling.

A ratification of the International Criminal Courts, perhaps leading to a prosecution of Bush and key officials for war crimes resulting from the illegal invasion and occupation of Iraq?  <br>  <br>  Electorally unpopular?  This is a president with steadily low approval ratings for the past 2-3 years so impeachment would not have raised any voter backlash.  In fact, many loathe Congress for not standing up to Bush firmly enough and for even aiding and abetting his policies on certain occasions (most recently, the Bush-devised Wall Street bailout).|`|MTNIQYEYaa	Because he did not do anything to be impeached for.  What are you referring to? The war? The war was authorized by Congress and Hillary voted for it, John Edwards, and many other democrats.  Also, the U.N. wanted to go into Iraq to inspect and Sadaam wouldn't let them so what was Sadaam hiding that he moved to another country - I wonder.  BTW Obama claims that he did not vote for the war.  But did you know that on such an important vote as actually going to war, Obama did not even show up to vote against it??

The main culprit is Rep. Barney Frank (D, Mass.), who relentlessly pestered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to make more and more risky loans, tu further foster the ideal of home ownership.  Many of these were for down payments of 3%, or even nothing at all, and at the slightest contraction of the market, these were underwater.  With many of these having been written as adjustables, interest rates went up and the owners could no longer afford the mortgage -- and with the deals now under water, foreclosures became inevitable.  The situation has fed on itself, and the banking system is now tied in a knot, buried under a pile of questionable paper against which reserves must be kept.  So banks are loathe to lend even to other banks, let alone employers who need credit to continue their business.  There is a specific term for this: it is called a depression.|`|6TzqioFraa	It's badly spun, though some what comprehensive it leaves much out.<br>  <br>  This thing is ALL democrats, NOT Wall street.

AA10719402	Obama... McCain didn't bring as much as he needed.|`|xJBJn6dOaa	Obama. Though I will have to admit, I like McCain on foreign policy better, but Obama's isn't awful.

That was a slap into one of the worlds most powerful leaders.  Bad move on McCain.  Right now we need to improve our foreign relations and McCain can't seem to grasp this.|`|5tp622JHaa	I think that Obama did much better than McCain during the debate.

And of course ear marks and the same stuff that he always talks about.|`|Ji8fEDh7aa	Obama. I kept hoping all afternoon that McCain would get sick and they would send Palin in for the debate.

McCain was up for the first hour on Domestic issues but it seems that Obama was in in the last 1/2 hour.  I call it a tie. Which is sad.  I wish someone could be the clear cut winner that is decided by partisan.  Both sides, of course, say they won.  Too me not clear winner.<br>  <br>    The only thing that makes me a little uneasy is Obama made over $500k in 2006 and made well over $4million in 2007<a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/o000167/" rel="nofollow">http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congr...</a> but still says he wants to help the middle class.  He has not been middle class, by his standard $250,000 or below for along time.  Many people call McCain and Elitist for being rich, well if we are going by income, Mr. Obama is right in the thick of that category.|`|8f000350e6b7497a6d3e30250383038baa	While I think Obama won (and the polls are showing it as well), I do concede that is a better speechmaker than debater.  He talks around issues too much (altho, to be fair, they both do), and appears very restrained.  When he really let his passion fly (like when he was discussing health care), he's amazing and you could see his numbers really peaking.  He definitely appeared more presidential and I found McCain's habit of walking in front of Obama - and his general air towards Obama - to be disdainful and rude.  You could almost read his nasty little spoiled brat mind "I can't BELIEVE I'm running against a BLACK man!"  (only considering the words he uses when addressing his WIFE, I'm sure his thoughts were a little more explicit)|`|KhPXcHv7aa	Honestly i don't think either person said anything different than the last debate .

"This is a guy who sang 'bomb, bomb, bomb Iran,' who called for the annihilation of North Korea — that I don't think is an example of speaking softly."<br>  <br>  That came in response to McCain's accusation that Obama had threatened to invade Pakistan. <br>  <a href="http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081008/ap_on_el_pr/presidential_debate;_ylt=Aqkkrh6cqjsGw8xYx0dLRzFp24cA">http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20081008/ap_o...</a><br>  |`|ZDXQRspQaa	I don't think it was a matter of winning, but I do think that Obama came across more Presidential.

In 2003 when the U.S. invaded Iraq, I was there. And.. at the time, I thought it was pretty bad.. I ended up being targeted by an RPG and.. it flipped my truck and blew the load on the back..       ....Followed by a few IED's on each side of the road.     I know first hand what the combat is like-- well I did in 2003. Now, I can also understand it's far worse than when I was there. So.. all these people telling you to stay with your family-- yes I can see why they'd say that.. But.. I really don't agree with that.    The guy that called you a coward-- blow him off. He knows nothing. No one knows NOTHING unless they've experienced it for themselves.    This is what I'd do. How about moving south for the time being? Try getting hooked up in Kuwait or moving a lil further south, to the United Arab Emirates or Oman. Saudi Arabia isn't a good choice at this time because they're currently in the conflict with Isreal and Lebanon. So, try to steer clear of that.    Now I understand that it'll be difficult and your family may not want to move... Try as hard as you can to get them out of there. If anything, as last resort, I'd even lie to the U.S. Army and exclaim to them how I and my family were displaced Kuwaiti's...The army offers medevac flights every evening out of Baghdad for a very low cost.. I think it's maybe 25 cents per person.. U.S. (which is 0.75 dinars). Once you get to Kuwait, your good.. I know that Oman has a system set up with the U.S. Marine Corps to offer displaced nationals of (Iraq) and the surrounding areas' a place of humanitarian aide and assistance.    Even that place might be better than risking yourself as a refuge in Norway.    Hope this helped.. if you need anyother info, contact me by my avatar link..

WYPEG8l7aa	We've lost millions of lives? <br>  So by millions you mean plural meaning more than 1 million so lets assume you mean 1,000,001 fair?<br>  okay lets do some basic elementary math. So the Iraq war has been going on for roughly 6 years now so thats about 2190 days since 365 * 6 is 2190<br>  <br>  So lets divide that 1,000,001 / 2190 = 456.62146....<br>  Okay so lets round that off...<br>  Thats about 457. So your saying in a day 457 people die?<br>  Does that sound mathematically feasible?|`|3ebb87ed0f276343bd04001d7c181545aa	Well all you need to know, is<br>  <br>  Obama said iraq was in a civil war, and a surge in troops, would not work to deescalate the situation.<br>  <br>  Obama was wrong.<br>  <br>  McCain had been calling for more troops for years, saying it would deescalate the insurgency.<br>  <br>  McCain was right.|`|18167e6cb8bb213b37ad670e7870b7fdaa	I think it's an argument intended to appeal to people who don't care that the war itself was never necessary, or that it was incompetently executed for years, at enormous cost, but only care that, eventually, America might declare itself the "winner." <br>  <br>  If our leaders themselves find this kind of argument appealing, I think that's just one more indication that they are not competent to hold the offices they've been elected to. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  |`|NMaCcyeKaa	Because the Surge got results.

Like it or not, the world is full of rules, some you may not agree with, but you must live by them all the same.  Your freedom to express yourself in a manner different than what is expected was taken away with the ACLU determination that religion cannot be expressed in a public shool, thank all the politically correctness for this type of actions.

	Grade wise...   3.6 or higher  SAT/ACT...      2000+/29+  Class Rank...   not as important as the top two  Extracurriculars..  More is not necessarily better.  They are looking for leaders.  If you've been a member of a club/group since your freshman year they will want to know if you became a leader (officer) of that group by senior year.  Athletics are good because it teaches teamwork and discipline.  Teamwork and discipline are traits they need in the military and STRESS at Annapolis.  What classes...  Take math and science every year.  Navy grads often say that they can get an engineering degree like that .  Simply choose a ccurriculum that includes 1) math and science and 2) any courses that are generally suggested for people who plan to pursue a college degree.  Otherwise, choose any classes you like.  FYI grades are important, but not as important as SAT/ACT score.  GPAs can be so subjective, but SAT/ACT; especially PSAT is a real gate-keeper score.    Either way, good luck.  There are a lot factors they look at and the whole process is long and arduous but they do look at the "WHOLE PERSON" concept.  Navy is a science and engineering school, but its not a nerd school they want a well-rounded person.
Zyvl0iHvaa	It's called a Government Handout.  You redistribute the wealth from the rich to the poor.  Obama's plan to build the economy from the bottom up.  Like the mortgage industry has proved that works so well, give the poor a house and they will get it foreclosed on.|`|Pa3OlB7taa	I live in a small town in Texas, and there is a family here that works their *** off for their welfare checks!  They found out that if you have four family's living under one roof you can claim them all as a dependent as the head of house.  Also if you literally have 15 and I repeat 15 kids you get extra money for each one.  Three died from freezing to death, but hey they have 12 more.  Maybe I'm a bad guy but I kinda think this is horribly wrong, but hey they got a new truck out the deal.  The point of this story is the next time you send a check to the IRS just know what your money is being used for.  We need to reform welfare and that would reduce taxes, maybe I should run for President.  This family is getting around 3500 a month for all the kids and the other families.  I'm all for helping people who can't afford to live, but I have a serious problem supporting someone who is too lazy to work.  Like I said maybe I'm a bad guy.|`|oFVTeL23aa	Exactly.  Sort of like how his health coverage plan will cover "everyone."  If there are ~47 million without health coverage, then there are ~258 million with coverage.  But he'll take credit for those already with coverage.<br>  <br>  And Matthew, while taxes are withheld from wage earners' paychecks, when low-income people file their taxes, guess what, they get all or most of that refunded to them.  So they aren't really "paying" taxes.  |`|UZcUIfwIaa	95% of 55%..............yah get it?|`|1bfd6f647a73749c637495a4c269b837aa	Because while McCain promises to represent 100% of America, Obama doesn't believe that's enough, and he'll represent 140% of Americans.<br>  <br>  That's more!|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	Obama needs to be asked about the AMT.  Also, the EIC.|`|lPwdDpxgaa	Obamanomics - haven't you heard?  It's a wonderful new economic science that allows voters to think that they are going to get relief, and the ones who don't deserve it get benefits, and the ones who work get screwed.|`|2gx2LgzEaa	Surely this question is full of logic logic, hence it will be ignored, just as mine are. <br>  <br>  Any logical posts usually are,<br>  <br>  to answer yor question... Socialism.|`|6AgnCKCPaa	You give that 45% even more money from those that actually pay taxes..|`|0bca92964b851ca1b2f27db7faf7f57baa	This is nothing more than the redistribution of wealth in the form of kool-Aid. Who's drinking? Not me.|`|AA10883806	Since most of the intelligent answers are from republicans to begin with I posit that they just don't get it.<br>  They are not accepting of the whole "Obama Experience".<br>  <br>  They are completely discounting "hope" and "change" which are the building blocks for the Obama plan. First he's gonna "change" things<br>  to make sure that noone is in the top 5% of taxpayers. Then he's gonna "hope" that punishing those rich people makes the rest so happy they'll just line up to give money to the government.<br>  <br>  In reality the way he'll get around "tax" increases he will simply make another s.s. type program that will be called an "Investment" or "program" (Future Health and Security Investment Program) to get around the word "tax". Everyone that makes a paycheck will pay it. How else will he pay for UHC and prop up SS?<br>  <br>  |`|cylb8em1aa	I've used my response in the past but it answers your question honestly.<br>  <br>  It is socialism and anyone who argues that it isn't, is daft:<br>  <br>  Let's put this nonsense about tax cuts for 95% of Americans to rest. The bottom 50% of income earners don't even pay income taxes, so how is Our Savior going to give them a tax break? What Obama is really talking about is tax credits. Here's how his plan will work. He'll come up with some fancy new tax credit to reward his minions for some type of acceptable behavior – like voting Democrat. Let's say the tax credit is $2000. But ... these people don't owe any taxes! So what good is a tax credit to them? Well, this is a new type of credit called a "refundable" tax credit. If you're eligible for the $2000 credit, and you don't owe any income taxes, you just get a check form the federal government for $2000. Just a very simple wealth redistribution plan. Remember, Obama and the Democrats think that wealth in the United States is not earned, it's distributed. It's the government's job to re-work that distribution to make it more "fair."|`|oWLe7TNIaa	Basic wealth re-distribution.  How 95% of people can receive a tax cut and we will be able to afford this bailout, institute socialized medicine, and increase welfare benefits is beyond me.<br>  <br>  If Obama gets in it will be Clinton #2.  Clinton promised to keep taxes the same or cut them.  Less than one month into office he realized his plans needed funding and he raised taxes.  Lie to get into the white house is what it's all about.  Convince the people they'll be better off with you as president to change America... and have no plan with how that is going to happen.|`|Ba6lYx9Xaa	Lets say there are 45 million taxable wage earners out of the 300 million citizens.<br>  <br>  45,000,000 * 95%= 42,750,000 would get a tax deduction the other 257,250,000 would not. That is what is so great about misdirection!<br>  <br>  100,000,000 * 95% = 95,000,000 would and 205,000,000 would not!|`|GFdppnFHaa	It's Obama's great lie.  He says "cut taxes".   He means "give tax credits".   If someone doesn't have a tax liability/owe any taxes and gets a credit, the government sends them a check.    Can you say wealth transfer?|`|k1jwNKbgaa	You can't, which is why these are empty promises from Obama.<br>  <br>  Especially after this bailout, there is no way he will afford to all the stuff he has been promising.|`|sZFLtCbdaa	Its all done with smoke and mirrors. Its refreshing to see someone ask an intelligent question. Good going.|`|Fv8C8ysNaa	Those people are going to get extra money on the 1st and 15th when they get their welfare checks.
AA10027038	Obama did release his records.  <br>  <br>  Honestly I think that her records will show a history of Depression or bipolar. The installation of a tanning bed is a common treatment for Seasonal Affective Disorder.  <br>  <br>  There isn't much other reason why a healthy woman wouldn't have done what is common in presidential elections and released her record.<br>  <br>  If she does have an illness and was being treated, I would think that would be a positive for her candidacy.|`|00ddc7f7cc561904db032288ec417cc6aa	I don't think her medical information is our business.

If something is wrong with them, that's personal. If they have something wrong that can cause them to kick the bucket, then what ever happens will happen. It shouldn't stop them from being president. If you had cancer or something, would you want your  job to say "oh, he'll die in a few years, we better not hire him, it's OK if he has a good back up though." That's Stupid!

Barack Hussein Obama is 47. Neither have released their records. John McCain has. I think this is your answer.<br>  SOME people have nothing to hide. Others are disregarding the badgering they received. But a Presidential candidate should NOT hide his medical records, Master's thesis, or list of past associates.<br>  McCain hasn't. And HE was a POW.|`|AA10132967	Probably for the same reason that Senator Nobama hasn't released his birth certificate----or his graduation certificate------or his certificate of baptism. 
tkX8VMDSaa	Probably not but it will most likely  help the undecided.<br>  <br>  My foreign contacts (I am a Translator) have been looking for the same<br>  leadership qualities, Colin Powell finds necessary.<br>  <br>  And McCain just yesterday made additional enemies abroad. He said <br>  Obama with his Socialist Plans is joining the European Socialist Leaders. <br>  McCain is compromising our national security even more as well as our economy.<br>  We need to export in order to maintain stability. There was a time when the Europeans needed us. No longer the case. Since McCain's<br>  refusal again and again of regulations has send most of our well paying jobs to China (and that is the reason for so many among us needing some sort of assistance), the rest of the World can get any and all of their goods elsewhere. <br>  So whatever little they buy from us may dry up due to such reckless<br>  statements as McCain made yesterday.<br>  We need the Europeans far more for many things, than they need us.<br>  They have learned well how important it is to agree and be united.<br>  <br>  McCain is even dividing us - we the people - by calling us, the City Dwellers, unpatriotic.  And again and again using his campaign to stir<br>  hatred and racism.<br>  <br>  In short, McCain is scary nationally and internationally.|`|bwEVh8qmaa	When I woke up to the sound of Powell's endorsement, I couldn't believe it.  It just can't get any better.  Everyone, black and white, loves and respects this man.  Obama couldn't get a better endorsement.  This might give Obama the little push he needs to win.  I was mad at Powell when he was showing us ariel photos, and trying to convince us that Iraq had WMDs.  Everyone believed him, even my boyfriend.  I was the only one in my entire crowd that said he was lying, there were no WMDs.  Everyone thought I was crazy.  I started to get over being mad, when he went AWOL, after he was so visible initially.  Then he resigned.  I took this to mean his conscience wouldn't allow him to continue being dishonest.  I'm absolutely gitty with joy.|`|AA12182751	To be honest, who cares. If you follow ANY endorsement, then you are as dumb as a stump anyway.  If you can't make up your own mind, and follow the endorsement of any celebrity, or General, or anyone, then you shouldn't be allowed to vote.  Get a clue, get your own mind, get educated, make a vote based on your beliefs, not some out of touch, wealthy, actor, or anyone.|`|236b0efe0cd727ee742018b701390d03aa	It already has. I was on the fence leaning McCain for economic reasons for a long time. Powell's choice of words for his endorsement changed my mind. I found that I have no reason to expect McCain to do anything that the current party leadership disagrees with--especially after having chosen Palin as his VP.|`|bFLP6COgaa	It's not likely to change mind of people already decided, but it probably will sway some undecided voters. Powell is still one of the most highly respected Republican figures in the country, so his opinion does carry some weight.|`|x81bKkFqaa	I know one person who was swayed by him, I was shocked that they were swayed because of him.|`|AA11390023	It probably will sway some voters, but not any of the vicious neo-cons on this website.|`|AA10222882	It would be news if a black man voted AGAINST Obama......|`|vp3cepeIaa	The honest answer I think is that some people on the fence, who are undecided will sway to Obama now.<br>  <br>  Remember there are the people who are gullible who believe the lies tha palin and mccain are passing around.<br>  <br>  just look at the rallies, these people think he is a muslim, heavens above and even more besides that.<br>  <br>  I think these people need to get internet access right away.

I don't really trust Obama but I don't like McCain - I think we have two bad choices this time.

We may not always agree on a political candidate or platform but WE DO RESPECT the political process.<br>  <br>  This time a greatly respected general has backed a Democrat.<br>  <br>  It speaks volumes about the Bush presidency and less about McCain's ability to be president.<br>  <br>  I truly believe McCain will breathe a fresh air of change in Washington DC as he has always been the maverick. He's not afraid to take on the tough issues, including campaign reform which he helped legislate, and now it's come back to haunt him. His campaign has limited funding since he chose to accept public campaign funds. Obama has reportedly spent far more than McCain to get elected.<br>  <br>  I'm still hanging in there, working to get McCain the maverick elected, as I do believe he is our best choice for president. <br>  <br>  He has the experience, dedication to country and he is a true patriot. He put his life on the line as a Vietnam POW.<br>  <br>  I am voting for McCain because he represents honor, duty, responsibility, patriotism and experience.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset years telling our children what it was once like in the United States where men were free." ~Ronald Reagan

DTSUJe2oaa	This article is from california employment law.~  Have you been forced to work through your lunch or rest breaks?  * Were you told that you needed to complete a task before you could take lunch and then never allowed to take your lunch break?    Every worker has a right to a 30-minute uninterrupted meal break. During your meal break you must be free to leave your workplace if you wish. Your employer does not have the right to expect that you be available to "fill in" if you are needed on your meal break. This is your time.    Every worker has a right to a "net" 10 minute break for every 4 hours of work, that begins when she arrived at a place appropriate for rest. It doesn't matter if you are a waitress, a hotel housekeeper or an inside salesperson; it doesn't matter if you work at a retail store or on a construction site. These rights are protected by California employment law.    If you are working during your lunch and meal breaks, then your employer probably owes you an extra hour of pay. You may be able to bring a case in court to seek pay for every lunch break you were denied and for missed rest periods.    A pattern of forcing or expecting employees to miss lunch or rest breaks is an unfair labor practice and what your employer owes you in unpaid time adds up over time.     Hourly employees who will work at least five hours must receive an unpaid uninterrupted 30aminute meal break; two meal breaks if you will be working more than 10 hours.    Employers must let hourly employees know that they can take 10 minute rest periods if they will be working a 4 hour shift. You can decide to waive your rest break, but your employer must let you know that you have the option of taking a break and cannot prevent you from taking that break.~

3vjgBDu4aa	The US consumer will not admit it but their failure to "buy Made in the USA' is the main force behind outsourcing and job loss to other countries.    In the US the consumer buys cheap foreign made goods over the more expensive US made goods, this trend in the market place aids foreign economy's and hurts the US economy. US companies to lower their labor cost and become more competitive in a globalized market. Seek that aid in the cheaper foreign workforce.     A good example is the auto industry, walk down to a busy traffic corner, and count all the foreign cars on the US highways, that is what caused the loss of the US auto industry. Even if you buy a Japanese car that is made in the US the profit of that sale goes to the Japanese economy not the US economy.    Why do you think the world has been critical of President Obama efforts to have US consumers to buy American?  We are the biggest user economy in the world.

Although the AF is all gung ho about claiming to be "pro education", some bases, AFSC's (Air Force Specialty Code - basically your job), missions, upgrade training, or supervisors will not allow you the time or the permission to take courses. But if you are able, take the college courses and get a bachelors. Many bases have college courses that are compressed. So instead of a course taking about 16 weeks, many courses are 8 weeks long, but you have to go longer during the day or more times during the week to complete them. Being an AF veteran that took college courses both during and after my service, I would recommend going to a junior college or community college for a year or two, to get your gen eds out of the way, CLEP courses that you can CLEP, and then transfer to a four year college that has an AFROTC program.

He's really getting a free ride on the fact that he was in the middle of the last great financial scandal in our country."<br>  <br>  McCain was "in the middle of" the Keating Five case in the sense that he was "exonerated." The lawyer for the Senate Ethics Committee wanted McCain removed from the investigation altogether, but, as The New York Times reported: "Sen. McCain was the only Republican embroiled in the affair, and Democrats on the panel would not release him."<br>  <br>  So John McCain has been held hostage by both the Viet Cong and the Democrats.<br>  <br>  Alter couldn't be expected to know that: As usual, he was lifting material directly from Kausfiles. What is unusual was that he was stealing a random thought sent in by Kausfiles' mother, who, the day before, had e-mailed: "It's time to bring up the Keating Five. Let McCain explain that scandal away."<br>  <br>  The Senate Ethics Committee lawyer who investigated McCain already had explained that scandal away -- repeatedly. It was celebrated lawyer Robert Bennett, most famous for defending a certain horny hick president a few years ago.<br>  <br>  In February this year, on Fox News' "Hannity and Colmes," Bennett said, for the eight billionth time:<br>  <br>  "First, I should tell your listeners I'm a registered Democrat, so I'm not on (McCain's) side of a lot of issues. But I investigated John McCain for a year and a half, at least, when I was special counsel to the Senate Ethics Committee in the Keating Five. ... And if there is one thing I am absolutely confident of, it is John McCain is an honest man. I recommended to the Senate Ethics Committee that he be cut out of the case, that there was no evidence against him."<br>  <br>  It's bad enough for Alter to be constantly ripping off Kausfiles. Now he's so devoid of his own ideas, he's ripping off the idle musings of Kausfiles' mother.<br>  <br>  Even if McCain had been implicated in the Keating Five scandal -- and he wasn't -- that would still have absolutely nothing to do with the subprime mortgage crisis currently roiling the financial markets. This crisis was caused by political correctness being forced on the mortgage lending industry in the Clinton era.<br>  <br>  Before the Democrats' affirmative action lending policies became an embarrassment, the Los Angeles Times reported that, starting in 1992, a majority-Democratic Congress "mandated that Fannie and Freddie increase their purchases of mortgages for low-income and medium-income borrowers. Operating under that requirement, Fannie Mae, in particular, has been aggressive and creative in stimulating minority gains."<br>  <br>  Under Clinton, the entire federal government put massive pressure on banks to grant more mortgages to the poor and minorities. Clinton's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, Andrew Cuomo, investigated Fannie Mae for racial discrimination and proposed that 50 percent of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's portfolio be made up of loans to low- to moderate-income borrowers by the year 2001.<br>  <br>  Instead of looking at "outdated criteria," such as the mortgage applicant's credit history and ability to make a down payment, banks were encouraged to consider nontraditional measures of credit-worthiness, such as having a good jump shot or having a missing child named "Caylee."<br>  <br>  Threatening lawsuits, Clinton's Federal Reserve demanded that banks treat welfare payments and unemployment benefits as valid income sources to qualify for a mortgage. That isn't a joke -- it's a fact.<br>  <br>  When Democrats controlled both the executive and legislative branches, political correctness was given a veto over sound business practices.<br>  <br>  In 1999, liberals were bragging about extending affirmative action to the financial sector. Los Angeles Times reporter Ron Brownstein hailed the Clinton administration's affirmative action lending policies as one of the "hidden success stories" of the Clinton administration, saying that "black and Latino homeownership has surged to the highest level ever recorded."<br>  <br>  Meanwhile, economists were screaming from the rooftops that the Democrats were forcing mortgage lenders to issue loans that would fail the moment the housing market slowed and deadbeat borrowers couldn't get out of their loans by selling their houses.<br>  <br>  A decade later, the housing bubble burst and, as predicted, food-stamp-backed mortgages collapsed. Democrats set an affirmative action time-bomb and now it's gone off.<br>  <br>  In Bush's first year in office, the White House chief economist, N. Gregory Mankiw, warned that the government's "implicit subsidy" of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, combined with loans to unqualified borrowers, was creating a huge risk for the entire financial system.<br>  <br>  Rep. Barney Frank denounced Mankiw, saying he had no "concern about housing." How dare you oppose suicidal loans to people who can't repay them! |`|AA10774852	Not in the least.  It is primarily the result of Rep. Barney Frank (D, Mass) meddling in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, encouraging them to make unsound loans and be a lender of last resort.  Those chickens have now come home to roost -- with a vengeance.  The world credit system is now essentially dead, and will remain so until this mess is dealt with (which, given the failure of the House bill to pass today, won't be soon), and until that happens, there will be increasing unemployment as businesses become unable to purchase materials and consumers become unable to purchase finished product.|`|n653ENa6aa	Absolutely.<br>  <br>  People try to lay the blame for this on previous administrations, but the degree of incompetence, arrogance, greed, and ignorance shown by the Bush administration is unparalleled in American history.<br>  <br>  As far as whether they get away with it - that depends entirely on whether or not we allow them to get away with it.|`|AA11809403	partly, but it is also a result of the housing bubble, the stock bubble, deregulation run rampant, and greedy rich people.|`|MmNlPmkWaa	No it is because your butt boy Barney Frank failed to oversee Freddie Mac and Fannie May.  |`|07dbecd577f9ea4a7031637996b39fbcaa	A simple No|`|VSmQWuhEaa	No the bigger reason is the utter failure of the mortgage market due to government interference in that market which drove risk unacceptably high for the level of expected return. The genesis of that interference is the establishment of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as sub prime lenders during the early years of the Clinton Administration. Their exceptionally high risk tolerance (since the risk was born by taxpayers for these organizations) caused pressure by other lending institutions to increase their risk vs gain tolerance for home mortgage products in order to remain in the same business. The subprime market opened homebuying to a class of buyers previously excluded either for poor, or lack of credit history. Or generally a class of buyer with no history of making financial decisions, or a history of making poor financial decisions. This sudden increase in potential buyers, caused a larger demand for housing which led to the "boom" which drove prices up. Normally in the past when this occurred demand would fall off after houses went outside of an affordability threshold that was relative to average incomes. However due to the presence now in the market of those who do not make good buying decisions, psychology of the market (generally speaking the thought the market will continue in the same direction it was going) outweighed saner concerns that housing was overpriced and unaffordable. To compensate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac offered more exotic products (negative amortization, interest only, ARM etc) to the subprime market to keep selling mortgages to that market. These products were sold with the only path to success being that <br>  1 The Fed never raised its rates<br>  2 The purchased would continue to increase in value. <br>  <br>  These exotic products made what would have been a slow correction of price into an utter crash. Since when interests rates rose and the market made a small correction downward those on ARMs, interest only, and negative am could not refinance the same house for additional terms due to loss in value, or they simply could not afford the payment due to the ARM. So the small decrease in value and modestly rising interest rates led to a slew of foreclosures, drastically increasing supply of houses. At the same time the mistakes were realized and the subprime market, at least in the liberal form that it was operating, was shut down by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, causing a sudden decrease in demand for housing due to a reduction in qualified buyers. This led to the plummeting prices we now experience. Which virtually shut down new home building in the US as its first economic impact. The second impact comes as the private institutions which unwisely followed Fannie and Freddie's lead in mortgage selling become insolvent as their assets no longer can cover their debts due to defaulting mortgages. This has placed the credit market in the US under some stress. So that is the story as I see it.<br>  <br>  BTW the big W wanted tighter control of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and Democrats resisted his efforts to do so. Even the big Bill Clinton himself admitted that the democrat congress had culpability in not following Republicans on this issue. <br>  <br>  If you want to talk inflation. Yes that has Iraq war spending written all over it. The economic impact of which is small compared to the credit problem. If you want to talk credit crash, housing market crash, home building crash, unemployment resulting, I suggest you look at your local donkey. Providing the dream of home ownership to everyone, regardless of conditions, seems high minded and noble, right up until the idea hits the real world. And we the taxpayers have to bear the burden again.<br>  <br>  About that whole Iraq intelligence lie. I think the head of the CIA at the time should have to explain all of that faulty intelligence leading to the Iraq war, standing right beside the guy who appointed him to that position. <br>  George Tennent nominated by Bill Clinton.<br>  <br>  George whines a lot about being bullied by the Bush administration. However he never explains why he presented faulty intelligence, to that administration, the United States, and the World.

ne22im5Haa	The U.S. dwarfs both China and Russia militarily  both in terms of spending and technology. Russia was forced to develop nuclear weapons as a result of aggressive posturing by the U.S. most notably the nuclear attacks on Japan which served no real strategic purpose beyond a show of strength to the USSR.(shocking I know, but confirmed by government documents recently made public). Russia presents zero military threat to the U.S. and yet the CIA are brazenly interfering in Russia's domestic affair even trying to bring Georgia into NATO. Russias cold war military build up was  a reaction forced upon them by the  U.S. arms build up and was a quite deliberate ploy by the U.S. to force Russia into an arms race that would bankrupt them.  Your government have a hugely successful propoganda machine that takes imaginary threats and ramps them up to ridiculous extremes in order to manufacture consent for actions that would ordinarily be domesticaly unpopular. Think back to how the U.S. government managed to convince the populace that they were in imminent military peril from Cuba. The usual reaction to this is to invoke the missile crisis but the missile crisis was the result of U.S. agression and several invasion attempts which forced Cuba to look to the Soviet Union for protection. Viewed objectively the threat posed by tiny impoverished Cuba to thew massive wealthy U.S. is the threat posed to a tiger by a buttercup and yet still the myth persists.|`|Rwn0svq0aa	No. We are already in a proxy war with both countries including Iran.

When September rolls around (the fiscal year starts in October), there's no money left, so there is no health care. TINSTAAFL.

I have no gripes about universal coverage for basic care, but defining what's basic must be done first. Then, I find the idea of forced rationing distasteful, though if there are no restrictions on additional coverage in the "universal" system, that's fine by me, too.<br>  Obama, by the way, is dead wrong about health care being a "right."

And because those who promote universal health care tend to be more intellectual and less capable of explaining it in a way that less intelligent people can understand, while those bellowing "lookout!' can be clearly heard.<br>  <br>  To those so afraid that universal health care would be too socialistic, I say, do you like having freeways?

Curricula, funding, teaching, and other policies are set through locally elected school boards by jurisdiction over school districts. The school districts are special-purpose districts authorized by provisions of state law. Generally, state governments can and do set minimum standards relating to almost all activities of primary and secondary schools, as well as funding and authorization to enact local school taxes to support the schools -- primarily through real property taxes. The federal government funds aid to states and school districts that meet minimum federal standards<br>  <br>  Bottom line:As recently as the 1960s, low-cost health insurance was available to virtually everyone in America - including people with existing medical problems. Doctors made house calls. A hospital stay cost only a few days' pay. Charity hospitals were available to take care of families who could not afford to pay for healthcare.<br>  <br>  Since then the federal government has increasingly intervened through Medicare, Medicaid, the HMO Act and tens of thousands of regulations on doctors, hospitals and health-insurance companies.<br>  Today, more than 50 percent of all healthcare dollars are spent by the government. <br>  <br>  Solutions?<br>  1. Establish Medical Saving Accounts.<br>  2. Deregulate the healthcare industry.<br>  3. Remove barriers to safe, affordable medicines<br>  In fact, the FDA has driven up healthcare costs and deprived millions of Americans of much-needed treatments. For example, during a 10-year delay in approving Propanolol Propranolol (a heart medication for treating angina and hypertension), approximately 100,000 people died who could have been treated with this lifesaving drug.

So if you are thinking of the stereotype of a Christian (morally conservative and these beliefs extended to law), then the term "Christian libertarian" is oxymoronic. But if a Christian person's personal beliefs (assuming they are anti-abortion etc) do not affect their voting powers because they separate church and state then they can be considered a Christian libertarian. Now, the republican party consists of a christian base and libertarians. But the evangelicals are scaring off the libertarians so they are increasingly becoming free agents (most of the independent voters are libertarians this election) or even shifting to the Democrat party.<br>  <br>  So to answer your question, liberals and libertarians oppose each other on fiscal issues.

Even today we can see the grip of the occult on society. Look at voodun for instance...mind over matter perhaps, but I question how much a human can do on its own, minus necromantic occultism.

"Solar power is still the best alternative energy source, and it is because of that that it's still decades away from being fully researched and employed in our everyday lives"    --Solar energy is used with great success in the western US were large areas of land are available to be used for solar projects.     "why,..because the Big oil barrons would be out of a job,...plain and simple"     --It is inefficient use as a large power source.  An overcast day can hinder generation from the sites, plus the large amount of area required focusing enough light to heat water cells or even PV cells.  Let's not count out nighttime.

I'm all for driving big block Chevy's, but they seemed to have been taken off the market until most recently.  Why is that??

And yes, some even pay income taxes.     As long as that is the case, the American government will do nothing. For generations there has been illegal migration to this country and it will not change because it actually benefits the government and the economy.     So quit moaning about illegals and point the blame where it belong, the American government.     If you were dirt poor and your kids had no food to eat and you had the ability to cross over to a country that would offer you what America offers, wouldn't you come? I am sorry but I would put the welfare of my kids before any government and its laws.    And no they don't come here because it is the greatest country in the world, they come here because it the closest to them, if we were Canada they would be coming here.     England had the same problem, they would get illegal migration from India, Pakistan, Taiwan because they have jobs opportunities they cant find in there own country....Strangely, when Europe opened its borders, the illegal migration to certain countries like England slowed substantially, why because the illegals went to places like Romania, it was much closer.|`|7be93b374eef1ff849acc6a33e5b7d03aa	We all have to take responsibility for our own actions.

09b2deaf36206664a2ebbe7f912a1177aa	Well, when you look at the issue from a modern viewpoint, it's the Israelis who invaded the region and ejected many Palestinians unlawfully and unjustly from their land with the help of the English and the Americans.  They don't belong there.  They say that they have a right to their holy land; however, the Muslims there have a right to their hold land as well, which is basically the same territory as that of the Jews.  So these two holy land claims cancel each other out when we look at the issue fairly.  So, the only thing left is deciding who was settled there first, and those people are the Palestinians; they therefore have the right to the land.  Sure, if the Israelis want a land of refuge from the oppression of Europe that they felt before and during World War II, then perhaps they can be given some land.  But beggars shouldn't be choosers.  And they shouldn't continuously oppress a people who seem to only be fighting for their freedom and sovereignty.  Indeed, I support neither the Palestinians nor the Israelis, but it seems that the Palestinians have more right to have that land than the Israelis do.  Westerners are culturally biased in their support of the latter and its acts of war.|`|4b66e2a38635ee0a1c43d40980b89929aa	I wished I was there helping Israel.|`|AA11942868	I am as appalled as you are, I grew up in Northern Ireland and if the UK government had launched air strikes everytime something bad happened in my city then the world would have gone nuts.

The problem is where our money is going and where the pressure is being placed.  Isreal have no need to behave the way they do because palastine would be crippled if we (Europe) pulled the plug on them.  The US and Europe need to tell Isreal to back down and threaten Palastine if they fail to react accordingly.      Why they haven't hired me to sort the world out yet I don't know.  I would even charge that much, maybe a little island or a nice boat|`|AA10966551	They are responding to continued attacks. If they were bombing the hell out of Gaza it woulldn't be there anymore. Palestine needs to do exactly what your country did...cut the sh**!!!|`|934cee924e7db76d709421d8fdea66f4aa	Most of the world is fed up with Israel. The UN is launching massive investigations into the actions of these despots.    A more appropriate question would be 'why is America allowing Israel to do what they (have been) doing in Palestine (for the past 50+ years)?'     That is the question, and the answer is completely beyond me. I can't imagine a single reason that we would tolerate these actions in one country but condemn them in all others. Maybe Israelis are percieved as "white" by people ignorant enough to make this distinction and that alone is cause for their support against those "brown" people. Americans, at least most the ones I know, are easily dumb enough to make this distinction. I am willing to wager that the other answers you get to your question will prove that hypothesis relevant.    l will use my stock answer for the impetus of any action/inaction by the US Government: Dollar Bills.    Have you noticed the language the media uses to indirectly characterise the parties involved?  Palestinians = Refugee, Gunman, Terrorist  Israelis = Settler, Soldier, Peacekeeper    The imagery they utilize in the media paints the Palestinians as the enemy without having to call them the enemy. To me, it seems intentional. What does the media have to gain?    This is class warfare. Religion is just a guise used by the people who will benifit from the ensuing strife. More than just murdering Palestinian civilians, Israel has gone to great lengths to destroy Palestine economically. The willful destruction of  any technology in Palestine, including computers, power lines, phone lines, etc., is well documented and the intentions are obvious. They keep Palestine so poor that the only choice for retaliation by Palestinians is to throw rocks at tanks, or, worst of all, strap on a bomb. When these citizens become this desperate and defenseless, suicide seems their only recourse. Sheer desperation and hopelessness. Ultimately they become useful idiots, allowing Israel to cry "Terror" and further use their military to murder Palestinians who had nothing to do with the bombing. It only takes one jerk to strap on a suicide bomb. The Israelis seem to have no problem ignoring that and condemning an entire group of people.    An obvious reason for our tolerance could be the large amount of Israeli citizens who vote in American elections. The amount of Israelis participating in American elections could have decided the last two presidential elections in America, and probably did.    Sorry to answer your question with more questions. I believe the world is going to stand up and condemn the murderers in Israel, on both sides. It seeme obvious where the US will stand, but I think we will look really silly siding with Israel against the rest of the world. It seems to me there is more evidence of war crimes against Ariel Sharon and the Israeli army/gunmen from the early 80's then they could ever hope to pin on Saddam.    I would proudly stand up and throw a stone in the name of freedom from tyranny.    Follow the money. Check the reciepts.

Although it would be a kind gesture to reduce prices now that energy is more affordable, the companies will not becuase they have found a higher price point which customers will (or rather have to) pay.     The company makes more money, you spend more on necessities, capitalism wins!|`|lXOkRTPaaa	Food prices are not just dependent on oil and gas prices, but many factors.

And if what's his name was in office right now I am sure he wouldn't be trying to push through about $ 845 billion dollars worth of liberal payback campaign contributions pork.    Senator John Mc Cain is a good man and he has done much for our Country and he unlike the President Obama tried to fix the housing market before it crashed.

I pray that Obama does a great job because we all need to put country first! However, it appears that line of thought has not reached the Democratic Congress. Just look at the Stimulus Bill. Over 300 independent economist agree there is way to much pork, special interest, etc in it. Its suppose to be a stimulus bill. If our leaders were putting America first, would all this massive spending that won't stimulate anything be in there. I'm afraid its politics as usual.

Oh well, the plan that bothers me is the bailout plan for companies like the auto industry and banking industry. We need reform from both, I think it is a waste of time to throw money at the auto industry,it will ultimately fail. Last march GM announced it had over 70 billion in assets and credit. They announced they were fine reassuring investors to back them. All who invested lost badly, a crime in itself. In 6 months they blew through that money and now say giving them several billion would help... help what, prolong the agony. No thanks the only thing that will save it is to go bankrupt, renegotiate labor wages,ceo salaries, and reform their industry. For close to 30 years,things have been great for them and they have continued to give increases to laborers and managers.Welcome to the average man's world where our income is much lower and we must get by on less. the only way we get out of this is reform on all fronts, that will show everyone what our great nation can do when it is necessary.|`|jEqISBnQaa	This package is for a very few winners; the rest of us are the losers.|`|AA10301974	Disagree.

POriIGJtaa	ummmm they don't have doors there?|`|kTaa8ejpaa	Turkey and all such countries that treasure democracy should support Israel.  Hamas and the palestinians received a gaza in tact with crops in the field.  They let the crops go to hell, squandered billions of international relief on Iranian rockets and stand as a buffer to forever torment Israel from having any peace in their own land.    This is the role of the palestinian, one sworn to the eradication of Israel as a nation and a people.    Don't cry for them, they are evil.|`|hscH4jHcaa	And, why do you try so hard to discredit and slander the PM of your country?

They will either have to learn to live together or exterminate one another. Neither side can have everything they want as long as the other side exists. So you either lower your expectations and take what you can get, or you kill your enemy to the last man.

Hamas will be part of a solution, but it will have to be a Hamas that renounces terrorism and accepts the existence of Israel in something like the 1967 borders. Many voices in Hamas are willing to do that, but there are hard liners that are not, and it's wrong to give them encouragement because it makes the conflict insoluble.|`|rc4B8Vdaaa	We ,Bolsheviks, are very happy, Israel is destabilizing Middle East.Even Turkey, an Israeli allie is at ods with the Zionist regime.    We love all this mess in the World!|`|MPpO4xQMaa	I believe there won't be any peace at least not in the few coming years, the problem isn't about Israel and Palestine actually there are a lot of international players in this Surviving game and those players keep changing constantly , it used to be Russia when Russia was a great power and all the Arabian countries were weak but but after that she left her chair for Iran, Syria and of course some other powers like Egypt and Saudi Arabia , while on the other side there was the UK who used to be Israel best friend and now we see the Us as the biggest ally of Israel, the peace depends on all of those countries intentions and benefits , it depends on the relationships between them and on their effect on the Palestinians and Israelis , sure the main two sides are Israel and the Palestinians but their like two gladiators being watched and supported by the international powers, but I believe we would be fools if we believe the Palestinains are Israelis control their own decision and Turkey now is the only trustable country both sides trust and believe in, I believe Erdo?an is just being netural, yes maybe at some point we see that strange cause we havnt seen a lot of leaders standing against Israel and telling their opinon but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing, if we like it or not but Hamas is elected in a majority of 67 % and a lot of Plaestinians support them so if we want to reach peace we should talk to Hamas and nogitiate with them and that's what Erdo?an wants and achieved ,this give more credibility to Turkey to play the mediator part to solve this conflict|`|4e7phuaoaa	Hi:   In fact the conflict  between Israel and Palestinian,  are come back to since thousands years  . are sourced from  both Religion& beliefs ( Jewish+Islamic ) only    No Nasser.

hcc8fq7jaa	Tricky, aren't they? Here's what it's about: "Weak-willed" people, as XG6 referred to smokers (and I'm one), are in the minority in this country. We are looked upon, by many, as lower than junkies. When government (state or fed) decides to hike up taxes on us evil smokers, the general public (non-smokers) don't care. In fact, many are happy to see us "punished" for our "evil ways". Even better if THEY can get something for nothing at our expense. It comes down to the basic human weakness of greed. Politicians know this, and exploit it. In a tough economy, it's hard to justify increasing the average joe's income tax in order to foist yet another wasteful government expansion, so, "Hey, let's do it on the backs of smokers!" Now, if several years down the road, many people quit smoking, and the revenue is no longer there to pay for the program, congress will simply declare an emergency, and claim they have "no choice but to raise taxes" ON EVERYONE. So you smug non-smokers who think this is a bright idea, just wait. It WILL come back to bite you, too.|`|isbGvDRZaa	Maybe because one in five Americans are being killed by tobacco?|`|5Ho518J9aa	Because it is completely illogical, and results in another unfunded Liberal Agendistic Government program to get control of the very LIVES of the people.

None!  Zip.  All he has ever done is run for office.

Then ***** up a storm about pissing money away on the war and blaming it all on Bush! Clinton has no balls was given a okay to kill bin laden after we  stoped financing him cause he was to busy shoving a cuban up some girls you know what and Hillary miss pro female telling every women not to deal with a cheating man just sweeps it under the rug like no big deal and in the mean time we lost a record number of american lives cause of his and her wrong doings!!! So far we spent 150 million plus on Obama's celebration when bush only spent 43 million and Clinton  spent even less on his.Ya we got the right to bash him when we got a record   of true americans in the unemployment line and he's pissing are tax dollars away!35 thousand boots on the ground in Afghanistan and 50 thousand in D.C. for him, ya that makes sense. stimulus package to screw the small guys like Joe the plumber who are just trying to survive in these trying times and he's on the tv whining about his kids having a dam snow day!!!!!

They will attack conservatives at every corner and then ask for the same people's support in their efforts. How many times have you heard of a liberal speaker being jeered and and shouted over at speaking engagements, yet it happens with great frequency to conservative speakers. Instead of backing there ideas with facts or research they will simply out shout you and consider that a victory. If Mr. Bush took the same exact actions that Mr. Obama takes, there most certainly would all kinds of attacks on him and twisted reports by the media to shame our president. The thing that really upsets me is I will give Mr. Obama a chance and hope he does well for this country even if I do not agree with his policies. I believe in our great country and although liberals will say they do, I ask why then do they want to change things to make it more like a socialist country with everyone "equal" on all fronts? That is not what America is,we our a capitalist country, why do we want to punish those who follow the american dream and get ahead?|`|AA10031363	Hello. I am a Democrat. I will now proceed to give you my take on things.    Oh God, Bush-bashing... good times. I had fun criticizing his foreign policy and unique word choice.     And I do not begrudge you the same privilege. Feel free to say that Obama has silly ears. Feel free to say you think his economic plan is going to land us in a depression. Hell, go ahead and say you think the terrorists are going to kill us all because he shut down Guantanamo.     I will never call you anti-American for criticizing the government. Griping about the president is as American as apple pie. I might call you an asshole, though, for saying that he's a Muslim or questioning his right to the office.    What really grinds my gears, though, is that Republican talk show hosts who used to say that we crazy liberals were going to bring about the downfall of civilization by voicing our concerns about Bush, they are now just picking at Obama. But it's okay. That's the American way.    What I'm trying to say is that we don't begrudge you some poking fun. Have at it. But don't forget that when the Democrats were the ones poking fun, there were as many- if not more- Republicans telling US that WE were unAmerican.|`|qBS4b7Kjaa	all i wanted to know is why they never got osama bin laden, where the wmd in iraq went......and I had to question mccains jugdement in picking sarah palin.

However you have forgotten one very important point,     The messiah can do no wrong. He walks on water too. If you ever criticize him that means you are a bigot and without understanding because Obama is the smartest man who was ever born... Please remember this before you ask any more questions of the antichrist.     The popular vote put Hitler into office also. It happened once and it can happen again. The blind leading the blind... need I say any more.
BQdXnCcHaa	When Clinton left office, we were sliding into a recession and suffering from the dot-com bomb. 9/11 made that worse. There is no telling what Clinton-Gore would have done.    However, the only reason Clinton-Gore was running at a PROJECTED surplus was because they cut the military by 30 percent.    And then we suffered the worst attack on American soil in history.    Coincidence?|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Clinton: surplus    Bush  2: Reganesk Deficits|`|fjT0GoSqaa	Phony projections by Bubba.  Who can project what will happen nine years after he leaves office?   Nobody.

Now I will agree Bush allowed way to much spending, while the Republicans, and the Democrats went along with it, but 911 was a good reason, and if Bill Clinton would have taken terrorism seriously, and fought back against 5 separate attacks on American interests, then 911 could have been avoided.    And now Democrat Obama, wants to outspend the Clinton, Bush and Reagan, budgets all combined.    Now I think it is time for taxpayers to unite, and stop this abuse by Republican and Democrat politicans.|`|AA10470367	I'm not sure when our country changed to one man having the power to control every massive bill passed by congress. Well, actually that be happening right now. But anyway, you need to get your head out of the media sand and understand the reason why congress has had the lowest rating of all time. What have they done to help change the direction of the country? I believe history will show that our entire government during the last many years failed the people, not just one man.
fqLo4HvKaa	It's just the strategy they have adopted to obtain personal and party political power. The American nation and its people are not the issue; personal wealth and political power are.    The have relied so heavily and for so long on manipulating the most stupid segment of the American population that actually vote as their political base that they have forgotten the need to be clever and smart when trying to scam the public.    t's really pathetic - almost as if they are running around naked but don't know it. If they didn't so deserve to be ridiculed and humiliated, a considerate person suggest they put some clothes on. It won't be me though, I'm laughing too hard.|`|PG2gd1tOaa	LOL, the first two things this clown did was close Gitmo and pay for abortions and rubbers in foreign countries, yep that sure put a lot of money in my pocket.|`|cc3820a15b7c09ec25ef5a6c571f58b7aa	psssst, because he lied to you during the campaign.|`|ca4d1a722e751ae09dcec4cce410f2dfaa	Executive orders are unconstitutional.

The "detractors" are the people in the opposition party, the Republican Party.  They have a vested interest in seeing him fail.  They also have to set themselves up as the alternative to him and the Democratic Party.    The real question is is he backpeddling or is he just being honest. I'm a Republican and I think he's being honest.  So far, I like what I see.    As for pretending to care, that's a lot more than the Bush/Cheney people did, so we're better off there, too.|`|jRXQ6kgCaa	Because, like you, they just need something to complain about.|`|5YTkGB5yaa	I havent said anything about his back peddling. But he's signed almost as many executive orders in 10 days than Bush has his entire tenure.....when Bush did it you all whined that it was an abuse of power. Now that Obamas doing it, its OK?|`|7L8Q91KBaa	They are pathetic losers who want to see Obama fail. Just laugh at those idiots.

I don't take it as detraction; I see it as something to consider (because sometimes your opposition does see things from a different perspective that you & your supporters haven't even considered which may make a big difference).  It keeps you (or the President) on your toes so you don't get lazy or start to feel too god-like or like you are a king and all you have to do is wave your hand to make it so.  Most of us know just from being alive long enough, that once a president finally gets in office, things ain't what he thought it was, there's a lot of underbelly that was never exposed--so a new president especially has to spend an awfully lot of time reviewing what his predecessor did, consulting the appropriate advisers, and then deciding how to reverse engineer the bad stuff.  If your opposing party didn't criticize you about every thing you do as president, I would get very very very suspicious and wonder what is going on, what I did wrong, why aren't they at least pointing out my bad posture or that I need a haircut or something.  It just would be unnatural for the opposing party to shut up, lay down and just meekly accept whatever the president put forth.|`|KvCD7wQMaa	Because changes take time to reflect in the economy. Some say 18 months before a stimulus will show any effect. This is the case no matter who is president.     Obama is no special case!!|`|wEOJyEw0aa	Because that's the Party line Bush left them with|`|TuDQHk8Xaa	I haven't said either.  Case in point, the Re-Election Stimulus Package, which won't have any real effect until 2012.  Convenient, huh?|`|7d2d6d4d7776168256be9f967571c2caaa	Because they've already made up their mind about him. It doesn't matter what he does, he's still a "bad" person and president. Heck, he can give each of his Haters a million dollars each, they'd still spit on his face. That's how evil this people are!|`|1tNmUmE3aa	He's signing the ones he "wants" to sign....not the ones that are important to us.  The really important promises won't help the government get what they want.  That's why he's only pretending to care...he makes you think he's doing as promised.
hZJ6xx1Kaa	There is no mechanism for direct democracy at the Federal level.  Because trade has been interpreted as "regulation of commerce" it is a Federal issue, and therefore only voted on by the legislature.|`|VK0brk89aa	Why would you want to get rid of free trade?    The problem most people overlook and Politicians use as an excuse is we lose jobs. That is wrong. Many States Business Tax Rates are so high that it's not affordable to do business in.     States Business Tax Rates should be very low and that would attract more businesses, jobs and the amount of money collected on taxes.    Wouldn't 1000 businesses create more jobs and taxes than charging 10 business the highest tax rate.    Are you saying we should shut down Walmart?|`|OYtoM9fXaa	Absolutely not.  We are not a direct democracy, nor should we aspire to be.  We are a representative democracy.  You DO get to vote on these and other matters: on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November in even-numbered years.  If you don't like the way your representative or senator voted on these issues, vote him out of office.    There's no reason to bastardize the Constitution for some feel-good measures when the Constitution has worked just fine for well over 200 years.|`|AA11091145	Congress should block Obama's short sightedness.

[1] The NAIS is the result of extensive lobbying from large factory farms "agribusiness" to protect themselves against possible liability when an epidemic occurs.[citation needed] Administered at the federal level by the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service, a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture, NAIS will also be overseen by state animal health boards.

And frankly, both conservatives and liberals have very good ideas and policies.  Both also have stupid and completely retarded policies.  Thats why you need to remain a centrist.  Take things issue by issue, not liberal or conservative.  And the liberals in the UK/Europe tend to be more Socialist/communist leaning.  And no, i dont want to be like Europe.|`|WvTbmSV3aa	Conservatives dislike liberals, because liberals dislike conservatives. If a liberals calls conservative a fascist and conservative calls liberals a commie, then it just fuels partisan divide.

Anyway, it's good to be a moderate, not a liberal or a conservative.|`|407f2f3df56644b5cae9f978edcbb062aa	You've been reading, or listening, to ultra-rightests in America.

They believe that the strong should survive and the weak should perish.|`|tebH4PEKaa	Conservative men are unsure of their masculinity and take it out on anyone who has a different point of view than theirs.|`|fWP8aBpsaa	First of all you need to distinguish between what you might term "liberal" and "Liberal".  One is a particular political philosophy, that believes in giving people the freedom to do what they like as long as they dont harm others (be that socially (i.e. what people do in their own home is their business) or economically (businesses shouldn't be unnecessarily regulated)).  The other is the name of a number of political parties (of which the Lib Dems are one), some of whose policies may or may not be "liberal"    In the US, liberal is a term that has been very effectively blackened.  In that sense, to some extent the original meaning of the word "liberal" has been lost in the US in a way that it hasn't in the UK.  A good number of right wing politicians in the UK would consider themselves liberal in various ways.  In the US many people who are actually  liberals (in the original meaning of the word) are ashamed to acknowledge the term because of the stigma.    Tony Blair tried to do to the same with "conservative" vs "Conservative" in the UK, when he talked of "forces of conservativism"  opposing reform.  He was actually referring as much to people in his own party as the Conservative party.|`|587533eca4604b2d23fa382dc6204d59aa	Because we've met them.  Early in U.S. history, "liberal" meant someone like Jefferson or Madison.  Later, as Hitler rose to power he was a pretty popular guy with fairly wide support all over the World. His political allies in the States called themselves "Progressives" until Hitler's name AND their movement's name became "dirty words." At that point they started calling themselves "liberal" because until then it had a positive connotation. NOTHING in their political agenda has changed since then - even a little bit.

There are basic underlying differences.    In the US liberalism has become not a word for stupid, just a work for more taxes.  It is quite unpopular to be a true liberal unless you live in a big city on either one of the coasts.     I think the idea of abolishing University fees is a wonderful idea, ours just keep getting higher and higher to the point where less and less people can get to go to University and there is less and less money being offered to help kids through college.    US liberals are not awful, just out of style, but we aren't going anywhere, we will still be around long after the Bible Belt loses hold of the Republican party.|`|e7276387cff3a4d02088a066ab5617b3aa	Liberals have in recent decades been the more "politically" oppressed voice in the US. It is led by diehard conservatives who have done well to impose their sense of "morality" onto the broader population.    If you look at statistics in the USA, liberals tend to have more graduate degrees, tend to live in the more populated areas, tend to be more progressive and open-minded, etc.|`|Q7ovix19aa	You answered your own question.  Most are so because they want a handout, not because they want to contribute.  In fact, most expect someone else to pay for all their demands.    But they aren't liberals.  Liberals advocate weak government, maximum freedom, and free-market capitalism.  They actually advocate socialist principles but steal the liberal label because they are cowards.  They live in an imaginary world and present whatever their imagination prefers, not what is real and true.    Conservatives aren't much better.  They have their own imaginary world, are partly national socialist, but do hold some actually conservative principles, and are less afraid to recognize what they are.|`|Lu1pTwRHaa	I'm a liberal republican myself and i have to say that both extremes of the parties are not good.

The reason so many of us don't like liberals is demonstrated by your example of "what you're all for". A complete lack of logic or common sense.    If university fees are eliminated, where does the money come from to pay for the teachers, janitors, administration, heat, light, etc.?    A liberal's answer is the government.    Where does the government's money comes from?    Most liberals won't know, but a few of the smarter ones will say taxes.    Where do taxes come from?    No liberal knows the answer to this, so I'll tell you: taxes come from hard-working people, some of whom may not have children going to university.    Now, here's a question that every liberal knows the answer to but that all are afraid to answer: Is it fair for someone who doesn't have a child going to university to be FORCED to pay for the education of someone else's child?|`|pgdTmT6caa	Liberals in the U.S. are different.  They are usually in very populated areas and look at things as an easy way out.  Over here it would be the conservatives that would want to abolish University fees.  The liberals would want to raise the fees.  It's a whole different story over here.  I cannot understand the liberal mind.  They think that paying taxes is a patriotic thing.  I don't get that one either.  You would have to come over to the states to experience it.  They also believe in throwing money into black holes.  Did I help you out here?|`|jj9G0BBraa	Abolish university fees? Why? Why shouldn't you pay for a good education? Who's going to pay the teachers for their time?Who's going to pay the bills for the building? Who's going to pay for the books? Do you have any clue what's going to happen if they do abolish said fees? They'll raise taxes.Every one pays those taxes.Why should someone else pay for YOUR education. How do you feel that that is right?You feel you're entitled to MY money?! Just who do you think you are?!!!|`|81fffddd6bb0bf3234c91426166d23c5aa	To me as a U.S. Citizen. It is a very interesting persepective from you as a brit.  First of all, Liberals in U.S always seems to label themselves as progressive and a big belief in having the answers by having the big government which means like build one village as one big group to have one rule and limit of the propserity also invlove more money coming from people's money(taxes) by spending on others and raise taxes to pay for each intentives of  what they created or what had been existed by the previous democrat party And,Second, very much want believe in all equalility,ingore the consequences of .Third, wants to see limited of freedom of speech on the other side to encourage the people to think negatively toward other party. Fourth, low income Liberals tend to think being dependent on the government menality to take care of them, not takes the reponsibility and care after themselves.   Republican party beleives in lowering taxes, and smaller government, not having the government get into people's lives and tend to learn from its lesson of history.  Independent party as I am now registering as to over see both parties fighting, and is very tired of it, wants to have the basic constitution be used and be real fair, use the honest way to run the government. It is more and more growing in this party than before.  Now to answer your question, I think the liberals in U.S. have gotten too far and caught up themselves with wrong messages they believe in. They are not bad people, but the wrong idelogicals where has nothing to do with economy to my view. If your government  going to abloish the University fees, and wanting to use Uni grant which mean you believe in government dependent.  What if the economy gets really bad worse, how will governement have the money to cover all University grants of thousand people?  Where the money really comes from? Have you ever question that? Maybe you don't want to know. I don't know the kind of liberals believe in other agendas they believe in than just one agenda to protest the College tution fees, you have in U.K. I really cannot compare that with enough observation. At least, in my view to tell you how I think of Liberals in my country.
eyJqrqn7aa	Which peace talks.  There have been so many.  As I recall originally with Carter not much was said as war between Israel and Egypt was imminent and the Gaza was under Israel and they were trying to give it back .  Egypt said no.  During the latest peace talks that's the main topic.  There can never be peace because Islam won't allow it.  Once Hamas is trounced and the rest of her neighbors set straight there will be a time of peace.  It won't last long.  The fate of the Pals is found in Psalm 83.

AlbJmy7aaa	This is a difficult issue. Jordanian comprises itself of over 70% of the Original British Mandate of Palestine.    Those people that were not already living there but became Jordanian citizens after moving there from the West Bank were required to renounce any claims they had to that remaining 30% that lay directly West of the river Jordan.   This is because the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan itself did this several years ago.    They have no interest in getting back the West Bank.. just like Egypt has no interest in taking back Gaza.    They just want peace and want not to be affected by war (refugees flooding across the border, incidents, cost, danger)    It is all  purely selfish interests.|`|MPpO4xQMaa	actually the plane was to give the west bank to jordan and Gaza to Egypt, but the Palestinians never agreed and jordan was afraid of the troubles the Palestinians may cause specially cause they're fighting for their freedom against Israel and if the west bank become a part of Jordan they will fight against Jordan, it was an attempt of Israel to get rid of the Palestinians forever

I always vote and campaign tactically for a set purpose.    In my own constituency there is a sitting Tory, who is retiring. Second place in 2005 last time was a LibDem - a strong candidate but let down by inept organisation.  Labour, Greens and UKIP got nowhere.  I would support any independent campaign with a chance of getting somewhere if only to instill some conscious and a bit of trouble into the cosy dealmaking at Westminster.    I have not yet made up my mind who I am supporting here.  The LibDems were trounced in Malvern by their arrogant closing of the public toilets, and my own LibDem county councillor let me down badly when I was bullied out of my job at County Hall, and he was sitting on the employee relations committee at the time. The LibDem PPC was unwilling to intervene (and to be fair neither was the Tory)    I have one personal mission to unseat the Home Secretary Jacqui Smith in nearby Redditch. I find New Labour's incursions onto some basic legal principles such as Habeas Corpus very worrying.    At the moment, it seems that Cameron's Tories have the edge, especially if they can do something to revitalise small business and industry, so Britain can start to earn its keep again and provide opportunities for me, so I do not have to retire in my fifties.  I have been an admirer of Kenneth Clarke for some time.  After the Lamont debacle, I thought the Tories were really scraping the barrel by appointing Clarke as Chancellor in 1993.  But he turned out to be a surprisingly good Chancellor, putting right the mess left to him by his predecessor, and passing on to Brown an economy that needed little further tinkering.    I am a little wary, since the last time I voted Tory for that reason (in 1979), I got badly burned at the 1981 Budget which did the exact opposite and closed down large swathes of the industry I thought the Tories were going to revive, and blew North Sea oil revenues on an orgy of designer spending.  I quickly ended up hating everything that Thatcher stood for, and the sort of people that voted for her, and became an Area Chairman of the SDP with the goal of unseating 50 Tories in the South of England.    Cameron is old money, an Eton toff.  What Margaret Thatcher would have called wet.  He may well have the social conscience combined with the business contacts to pull it off.  We'll see.    As for Labour - really it is a faceless copy of Major Toryism, and I could not support a party that brings people like Milburn, Byers, Hutton, Purnell, Harman and a host of sinister feminist baronesses into the shadows of control.  Now if Jon Cruddas were to take a leading role...|`|hsyI1DxDaa	Omg, I don't know, every party pretty much sucks..|`|jHVd9l1naa	I'm not going to vote.|`|AA11039968	Conservative and I'm a Jock|`|267e183fc4c4d2e8fdf6b6047a3857cdaa	UKIP, BNP or independent anti Europe.

3db332425694490a72f67bd5a83990d6aa	The Liberals use what Limbaugh and Hannity say on their shows, because Limbaugh and Hannity are directly piped into the administration.  The Republican media have direct, unfettered access to the president and his cabinet.    Unlike most Liberals on here, I actually DO listen to Limbaugh and Hannity.  I listen to the repetitive hammering home of talking points.  I listen to Sean Hannity cherry-picking phone calls from the most insane, incoherent, and idiotic Liberals, so that he can paint the broad brush that they're ALL like that.      I listen to them frame the debates to make them suit the message -- for instance, saying Democrats are against intercepting terrorist phone calls, when they're in fact against the unauthorized phone taps of American citizens without a court order.  Or when Hannity says that the Democrats are using fear to scare American into voting for them, while Dick Cheney talks about the prospect of "mass death in America" if you don't vote Republican.  Or when Limbaugh hammers on Michael J. Fox for his stem cell ad, but doesn't mention that Fox did an ad for Republican Arlen Specter in 2004 that said the same exact thing.    Most people SHOULD know better than to accept what ANYONE says as gospel before doing the research themselves.  Unfortunately, that's not how it works.  We're told we have to take their words for it... to trust them implicitly.  Don't ask questions.    In fact, it just happened yesterday.  During Donald Rumsfeld's press conference, a reporter had the misfortune of asking The Donald (I'm paraphrasing), "What happens if the Iraqi government does not meet the benchmarks discussed by the President at his press conference?"     After the Defense Secretary chided the reporter for even asking such a question,  he finally just said, "So you ought to just back off, take a look at it, relax, understand that it's complicated, it's difficult, that honorable people are working on these things together; there isn't any daylight between them. "    Don't ask question.  Just know that it's complicated.  That's all you need to know.  Sit back.  Relax.    So that's why Rush and Sean are so important in this process.  The administration relies on them to get their message out.  The administration lets them explain why they do what they do.|`|8ac2e5cbdd946ee60c803052559873c5aa	I say liberals hate Republicans...

Most people here think debating is saying "liberals suck" or "conservatives suck." What few people seem to realized is that nearly 70% of Americans are moderates. Moderates look for viable solutions to problems. At a debate, one must realize that the audience is there to hear the candidates solutions and make an intelligent decision as to who can solve the countries problems.  If your solution is liberals suck or conservatives suck, you are not presenting any intelligent information and will not win over your audience.  Most mature Americans don't listen to any of the talk show host you mention. Those shows are not much different than the Jerry Springer show. It's just hype to attract a paying audience.|`|0a9da900caa75ddd3649dc86b23475eaaa	Both sides do it...O'Reilly and Woodward for instance.|`|8a3c5583f6a5f699921e82605d0d43b9aa	Amen, bro.  I'm not trying to by offensive, but I really do find the liberal stance to be quite hypocritical.    There are several common examples of this.  "Majority rules", for instance.  Many left-wingers will say that, for example, abortion should remain legal because something like 51% of the population is pro-choice, while at the same time say that we shouldn't display the 10 commandments in public despite the fact that 95% of the country is christian.    Go figure.|`|9b16f0f4e2cb28a0b42a9fb95b5a10e9aa	Well most of the Republicans use these very people as their sources...so wtf?|`|bb67be57b37611049acefd6e08f6911aaa	I think that this incident frames the election quite nicely.  It demonstrates the hypocritical nature of the Republican mindset, who says out of one side of their mouths that they want to protect and preserve life and that they are compassionate, but then out of the other side of their heads they cast mockery and insults at anyone, including disabled Americans, who do not think they way they do.  Limbaugh is widely praised by most Republicans, and therefore to me seems representative of their mindsets.    Limbaugh is just one example of this kind of Republican depravity.  And is comes at a time when this talking head,...exhaulted by Republicans as being "right"...is himself a drug dependent person, disabled by his own inappropriate vices.  My Daddy always told me that you can see a person's soul in the words he uses...Since Limbaugh is the GOP poster child, it seems to me that Republicans cannot be trusted.  Who will they mock next?

I have not noticed that 'liberals' always point to Rush as their reasons for disliking the conservatives.  Of course, he's an easy target because he is a media figure and he says a LOT of dumb stuff.  It's also a generalization to say that all conservatives refernece politicians.    Personally, I tend to use the politician's actions against them, rather than focus on their words.  And really, that's the problem with your whole arguement.  It doens't matter what people say.  These politicians have an expensive team of handlers who script every word that comes out of their mouths.  That goes for republicans, conservatives, and all other parties from all nations.  (Except Venezuela for example.  That man says whatever comes up in his brain.  That guy just doesn't care).    Same with these spin doctors on the radio (What say you? is a catch phrase of Bill O'Reily, isn't it?  You a Bill fan?  I used to like him before he sold out).  These guys are paid for their personalities.  I would bet every dime I had that a lot of the issues they tout, they don't  actually agree totally with.  They just know it will cause controversy, and thus plublicity.  All publicity is good publicity for these people.    I would caution anyone who really wants to get down to the REAL issues to not listen to the words that fly around.  Watch the actions.  Read the legislation they sign.  Those are the real ways you can tell what your politicians are doing, and what they're worth.  You will end up with a much more intelligent point of view, backed by tangible facts, not words.      >>    Well then, I'll say this:  Words do not matter.  What they do is what matters.|`|a82c76a19c60f1c7a90e54dd10860fbeaa	I'm guessing the irony of your post is lost you.

AA12218378	Exactly,why trust the UN? I mean UN inspectors who went into Iraq before US attacked,it,said that Iraq has no WMD and that it is no threat to no one...And ,surprise...they were right...  The question is why trust US?When they attacked a country assuming that they own WMD,which weren't found not even today...So why trust Bush when he says that Iran is a threat?And by the way,as a country that signed the nuclear non proliferation treaty,Iran is entitled to a nuclear program,as long as it is in civil purposes only...and no one can prove the contrary...read it and see why the IAEA was helping Iran...  http://www.un.org/Depts/dda/WMD/treaty/|`|AA11429639	Note that the story talks about them suspending support.

AA11314617	You can take a picture of anyone in public (or any place viewable from a public place where they would not have an expectation of privacy).  Even obnoxious street performers.    It is what you do with the picture where things get a bit dicey.  If you publish the image, you might need to get a model release of some sort, depending upon whether people are identifiable, what you are saying about them, etc.  But merely taking a photograph of someone in public, where there is no expectation of privacy and no copyright or other restrictive concerns, is not a permissions matter.|`|7ab34e94ddfb9fc2595f5300203984bcaa	If your taking a picture of a celebrity in a concert I would say it's OK, but taking pictures of people that you don't really know (or celebrities in public), then I would say its not OK!!!

AA10333764	illegal immigration proponents is that those who enter the U.S. by breaking the law are invariably "hard-working" and "law-abiding" once they get here.   1. That argument, however, has one major flaw. According to Justice Department statistics and the analysis of immigration experts, the "law-abiding" claim often isn't true.   As Investors Business Daily reported in March 2005:   "The U.S. Justice Department estimated that 270,000 illegal immigrants served jail time nationally in 2003. Of those, 108,000 were in California. Some estimates show illegals now make up half of California's prison population, creating a massive criminal subculture that strains state budgets and creates a nightmare for local police forces."  Citing an Urban Institute study, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies Steven Camorata noted in 2004: "Roughly 17 percent of the prison population at the federal level are illegal aliens. That's a huge number since illegal aliens only account for about 3 percent of the total population."   1. Former California Gov. Pete Wilson places the percentage of illegal aliens in U.S. prisons even higher. In 2001, he told Fox News Channel's Bill O'Reilly:   "We had problems related to the costs of educating children who were acknowledged to be in the country illegally, healthcare costs. One in five in our prison population were illegal immigrants who had been convicted of a felony after entering the country illegally."   The Federation for American Immigration Reform also turned to the Justice Department to get statistics on criminal aliens. They report:   "In March 2000, Congress made public Department of Justice statistics showing that, over the previous five years, the INS had released over 35,000 criminal aliens instead of deporting them. Over 11,000 of those released went on to commit serious crimes, over 1,800 of which were violent ones [including 98 homicides, 142 sexual assaults, and 44 kidnaping].   "In 2001, thanks to a decision by the Supreme Court, the INS was forced to release into our society over 3,000 criminal aliens [who collectively had been convicted of 125 homicides, 387 sex offenses, and 772 assault charges]."   1. Up to a third of the U.S. federal prison population is composed of non-citizens, according to Federal Bureau of Prisons statistics - but not all non-citizen prison inmates are illegal aliens.   As to the "hard-working" claim, CIS notes: "The proportion of immigrant-headed households using at least one major welfare program is 24.5 percent compared to 16.3 percent for native households."   Investor's Business Daily concurs: "Once [illegals] get here, they are 50 percent more likely to be on welfare than citizens."|`|AA11370204	YES!!! Thanks for the link, it was real interesting and informative.|`|214e1adddf040b774a03079bd09796e3aa	Yes, I have a big problem with this.  One cannot engage in illegal activities and be honest at the same time.    Remember when Gore bestowed citizenship en mass right before the election.  The politicians spinning this theory are simply buying votes whether or not  these people are voting legally or even know what the elections are all about or how it will effect the future of the U.S., our taxes, our crime rate, our education, etc.
AA11826092	"Unconditional" is the key word for me.  While I support the right of Israel to exist, I think the idea of unconditional support is misplaced.  While peace will never happen in the region until the goal of Israel's destruction is no longer an objective of Israel's enemies, we can not turn a blind eye to everything Israel does just because their enemies are uncivilized and irrational.      On the other hand, I don't think a fear of Arab response is a valid concern. That would be like saying that you were worrying about what the Nazis would say if you endorsed the Jews.  You're dealing with an uncivilized part of the world that spends as much time hating other Islamic sects as the Jews. So whenever I hear something like "Israel's actions inflame Arabs" I have to think that they were already anti-semetic- this was just an excuse to act out (again).  Same with back in 1948.    I don't think our policy has, however, benefited or harmed the U.S.  As the dominant world power a lot of world will dislike us no matter what we do- Israel is just one of a million reasons.|`|AA11370204	Neither.

diir9hYraa	La verdad fastidian, parecen chiquillos, que si unos son pejefans, si otros fecles, etcc.. que si me reportas eres intolerante, asi como los niNitos...      Yo creo que como todo ciudadano tenemos derecho de reclamar y exigir a nuestras autoridades, a pesar de nuestras conviciones o nuestras preferencias. Muchos hasta parecen diputados que siguen la "linea" que les da el presidente, o  tipo algunas asociaones religiosas o sectas que siguen sin cuestionar a sus lideres...    Hubo fraide ono, Calderon esta en la presidencia, y como presidente uno exige que se hagan las cosas bien...    Para mi el narco no solo se va acabar con furza bruta o que se militarice todo el pais...     Haciendo retenes solo es darle atole con dedo, los meros narcos transportan mucho volumen de droga y creo que esas estan custiodadas por los gobiernos estatales y federales, no hay que hacernos.. ademas los meros narcos no viven en chozas, viven en mansiones, digo si con google maps o google earth podemos monitoriar todo el pais, que agencia de inteligencia o la AFI no los puedan localizar... Para mi solo se hacen pato e incubren a los narcos..    Se ve muchas noticias de retenes, de operativos, pero que no se hacen programas sociales y de salud, para tratar de erradicar el consumo. Menos el narcomenudeo, si los periodistas (aunque sea de tv Azteca) preguntando, localizan las "tienditas" que lo no puedan hacer las autoridades, lo que pasa es no quieren..    Desgraciadamente estamos atados a l oque EU diga, a pesar que ellos son los hipocritas y los grandes consumidores, digo entran toneladas de droga a EU, y que no se den cuenta? lo que pasa es que si lo saben, pero no hacen nada, por conveniencia....    Respecto a los derechos de libre transito y manifestacion, creo que si hiceran marchas que no invadieran todos los carriles, estaria bien. Si generaria trafico, pero seria menos peor que bloquear toda la vialidad...    Y hay muchas cosas que son propias de nuestra cultura, desgraciadamente el gobierno no hace caso hasta que se toman medidas asi de drasticas, caso Oaxaca que duro mucho tiempo, sin que en verdad se hicera algo, solo hasta que se puso feo actuaron (aunque sea mandando a la PFP).    Por otra parte tambien es culpa del gobierno federal y de los gobienos estatales, cuando no se les hace caso es su respectivos estados, vienen a presionar a la capital. Si las oficinal federales en los estados o los gobiernos estatales, resolvieran sus conflictos, no tendriamos tantas marchas y manifestaciones... Por ejemeplo las marchas de los de atenco, que son del estado de Mexico, de la APPO que son de Oaxaca, la de los 400 pueblos, que son de Veracruz, todos se vienen al DF, porque sus flojos gobenadores no hacen su trabajao o las oficinas federales en esos estados.. entonces donde esta el federalismo, mas bien parece centralismo, todos a la capital, para que les hagan caso!!!

Furono installate numerose pale a vento che producevano un buon quantitativo di energia pulita.

Comunque per capirci, la mediaset non e' una televisione a pagamento, puo' dare cio' che vuole in rete (purche non vada contro qualche legge), anzi mi ha sorpreso che addirittura rai2 abbia dato la diretta, segno proprio che questo sciopero era sentito da tutta la popolazione Italiana.    Uno che era in piazza.|`|290f16f4dc62f5616fa3c83bad784e45aa	lorix ha sicuramente ragione. io mi associo completamente alle idee di lorix. io lo definirei un utente di answers molto preciso, corretto, intelligente. lo scorso anno non c'era affatto regime. lorix ha ragione, se togli gli scandalosi luttazzi (che non faceva ridere), santoro (che faceva ridere) e persino il signor biagi con benigni (sotto elezioni). non si pu non ammettere che oggi, come ieri, c' il solito giornalismo di sinistra (corriere, repubblica) e comunista (liberazione, manifesto). aggiungo, televisivo, il tg3 (comunista), non  pi scandaloso del tg4 (l'unico pro-berlusconi). inoltre, mediaset  propriet berlusconi (striscia, iene, matrix incluse, non certo di destra). la rai  oggi lottizzata dalla sinistra ( un fatto, non un'opinione). tg1, tg2, tg5, studio aperto, non sono mai state, di parte berlusconiana. dimenticavo il grande fede, lo vogliono spedire sul satellite. LORIX non ha ragione. LORIX ha PERFETTAMENTE RAGIONE.      ps. grazie tante per l'irragionevole (io !!!???)      p.p.s. durante lo scorso governo Berlusconi quando la gente andava in piazza si oscurava la notizia. la dava pure fede la notizia. che dici?????    p.p.p.s. fede fa propaganda su tv privata (mediaset), santoro fa propaganda su tv pubblica (rai). se sono irragionevolezze queste........ semmai siamo noi che paghiamo (o finanziamo, fai tu), le irragionevolezze che dice santoro. mediaset viene fianziata dalla pubblicit...... alla rai paghiamo il canone (noi contribuenti, ti ricordo) ........ ragionaci visto che come dici tu, nessuno che riesce a motivarti seriamente perch. eccoti la motivazione (del presunto regime). bah, parlo col muro. o no?|`|87199a0a226e5e0f28535e6e4467d796aa	come vedi caro shin... tanti pollici.. poche risposte...   ma sai chi ha in mano le televisioni fa propaganda come gli pare...|`|4fcc80455ae07aabd43be67d44831572aa	Certo che questi di destra sono proprio dei creti ni, poverini.

Assommando Rai, Mediaset, la Sette e Sky almeno sei milioni di persone hanno trascorso tre ore di un sabato pomeriggio pre natalizio incollati alla tv. Quella  gente che, non essendo in piazza a Roma, ha partecipato alla manifestazione attraverso la piazza virtuale tanto acclamata, in passato, dalla sinistra e dai suoi coriferi....e poi.... Prodi e soci stanno a distinguere se sabato erano due milioni pi o meno dodicimila. La questione  decisiva: non potrebbe, lUnione, assoldare DeRaglio per la conta definitiva e porre fine al dubbio sulle due opposizioni? ....In fin dei conti Prodi non ha torto del tutto, alla manifestazione di sabato ci sono stati solo insulti, nessuna bandiera  stata incendiata, nessuno ha cantanto 10, 100, 1000 Nassirya, nessun poliziotto ha dovuto difendersi dallassalto a colpi di estintore. Voleva dire che siamo pi educati?    saluti|`|2c4a3dfd4467a1d0b18e76059f3a07d0aa	forse perch quella manifestazione non coinvolge ed interessa solo Berlusconi ma almeno 11 milioni di Italiani..  per quanto riguarda il regime e l'uso delle reti pubbliche basta guardare Santoro..  non dico altro perch ...si dice da solo|`|164ef5c751397a8cc0883633d0dd813faa	si oscurava? mah a me non sembra, comunque il fatto che sia stata data in diretta da LA7 (il canale pi schierato a sinistra dopo rai 3) e da Rai2 non credo sia merito di Berlusconi visto che non  al governo! Quindi se addirittura queste due emittenti l'hanno trasmesso in diretta, anche se non tutto,  dovuto al fatto che  stata una manifestazione di portata eccezzionale.. dopo tutto non mi sembra che qualcuno abbia fatto vedere in diretta la manifestazione dei polizziotti il giorno dopo o quella dei tassisti e di tutti gli altri che sono scesi in piazza.|`|e3cc3777df54eb5922453d83cdd13ab2aa	La differenza tra noi di Destra e voi di sinistra  evidente:  noi vi rispondiamo in modo civile portando motivazioni (vedi ZIO_LUPO), voi insultate e basta perch non sapete cosa dire (vedi NESSUNO)...

Aggiungo che sarebbe proprio un "regime anomalo"..... quello dove il Cda della RAI vede in minoranza le forze attualmente al Governo!!  Una trasmissione in diretta full time come non si registrava da tempo indica in modo inequivocabile che possiamo parlare di tutto fuorch di Regime....  Del resto non mi stupisce pi di tanto questo modo di fare politica da parte di una opposizione che evidenzia ancora una volta la straordinaria "perseveranza" di Berlusconi e & nell'agitare i fantasmi dei "comunisti dappertutto" e del  regime rosso che sopprime la libert.  E' un evidente sintomo della pochezza di idee e di progetti alternativi validi e seri.  Non  un caso che un elemento di spicco della passata legislatura come P.F. Casini ne abbia preso coscienza prendendo le distanze dalla stessa CDL.  Mi sembra quindi ovvio se non quasi impossibile non vedere come (e la cosa non pu che riflettersi come un boomerang sul comportamento delle forze dell'opposizione....!)  in un Paese dove la quasi totalit dei mezzi d'informazione viene gestita direttamente (vedi l'imprenditoria Berlusconiana ) o indirettamente proprio dall'opposizione, anche solo accennare a fantasiose ipotesi di Regime possa sembrare veramente poco serio ed irrispettoso verso il Cittadino stesso.|`|37e1ba78c311d25a1a3a00ef80c59fe2aa	Ho visto Santoro  ieri sera... ti basta questo?|`|eb14fbe55486d0dd812188913aa3bbe2aa	mi sono chiesto a anche io,  molto strano quando il clouwn Berluska era al  governo le manifestazioni di sinistra non potevano essere trasmesse dalla rai e si poteva censuare anche i giormalisti che secondo lui erano contro  il 1 ministro in carica , inevece  guarda un p invece la manifestazione del Duce del 2 dicembre 2006  stata trasmessa da tutte le emmitenti possibili ed immaginabili dell'italia.  Mi sa che il regime sta dove qualcuno non da libert all'alatra parte di esprimere la propria opinione. Stiamo anche ricontando le schede  bianche . Siamo un governo troppo democratico , adiffereza di voi . Imparate qualcosa forse la destra  ancora nostalgica del regime fascista. rai 3 sotto qualunque governo  a sempre dato notizie se poi ti offendi anche delle cose dette realmente dal tuo leader , incomincia a vergognati e  pensare.

48d60f2ce842a2b19ad9ec7947b43ef8aa	Pinoche  morto di vecchiaia ed anche Fidel Castro pi o meno ormai mori  naturalmente: il perch mi appare evidente questi due che ho citato hanno accettato dei compromessi con gli USA.  Pinoche ha fatto da dirigente CIA nella sua patria  Fidel Castro ha dato la possibilit agli USA per oltre 50anni di utilizzare Guantanamo per tutte le loro porcherie che non potevano farsi in casa loro. (su questo punto oggi  evidente che non cisia mai stata la volont di Fidel di risolvere la questione).    Il caro Saddam avrebbe potuto essere la vera testa di ponte per affrontare il problema del fondamentalismo islamico dall'interno dei paesi arabi, ma ha fatto la kazzata di non accordarsi sui soldi che gli USA erano disposti a dargli per accettare la loro politica del petrolio, poi un bricciolo di follia, molto narcisismo, e sindrome di onnipotenza han fatto il resto.    Per Hitler e Mussolini and allo stesso modo, Stalin si accord con gli USA, ed   morto anche lui nel suo letto.

Il perch Saddam sia stato impiccato e tanti altri dittatori no  forse da ricercare nel fatto che questo ha combattuto e perso una guerra come successe anche a Milosevich altro dittatore arrestato dalla potenza vincitrice che probabilmente sarebbe sfuggito alla morte ma non all'ergastolo.  Pinochet che sicuramente non  stato da meno rispetto a Saddam  sfuggito ad una giusta pena per due ragioni : la prima  che tutelava gli interessi USA, la seconda  che non ha combattuto e perso una guerra.  In caso di guerra la storia la scrivono i vincitori.|`|28b9d0823c3756a7f793410b05613fd9aa	perch pinochet ha fatto in tempo a cercare protezione altrove e perch non si  messo contro agli USA|`|9d13d4ebaa2b72754773bfd29c447770aa	Io non ti so rispondere.

Il tribunale che ha condannato saddam e fatta eseguire la pena capitale, secondo me,  da elogiare per la sua competenza e per la velocit nell'espletamento dei suoi doveri.  Se saddam fosse stato giudicato, per esempio in italia, sarebbe finita come in cile dove il giudicando o condannato sarebbe morto di vecchiaia prima di vedere eseguita la sua pena.  Salvo poi essere agevolato nel frattempo da indulti e amnistie varie che avrebbero ridotto la sua pena quel tanto da vederlo libero dopo pochi mesi.|`|1871f19e34130b6105b7702e0e9e4a74aa	In sudamerica non ci sono musulmani arrabbiati, ma popolazioni che, anche contro la loro volont, sono state convertite alla cristianit e dove, tranne che per i dittatori che governano con il terrore e la morte, la vita anche di un poco di buono come Pinochet, ha un valore.

Le immagini di Saddam davanti ai giudici riaccesero le passioni. I sunniti rividero il rais; gli sciiti il despota. I primi riconobbero il leader che aveva garantito l'antica egemonia sunnita nel paese e si sentirono solidali con lui; i secondi l'uomo che li aveva repressi e umiliati, e invocarono la sua condanna a morte. I sentimenti erano in armonia con gli ammazzamenti sempre pi frequenti tra sunniti e sciiti. I primi in generale solidali con l'insurrezione armata, i secondi con la polizia e l'esercito armati e pagati dagli americani. Chi aveva pensato che la cattura e il successivo processo di Saddam avrebbero via via smorzato la guerriglia saddamista, dovette molto presto ricredersi.     La parola "caos" ricorre sempre pi spesso ad indicare una situazione che sfugge ad ogni azione razionale, militare o politica. In queste condizioni la giustizia affidata a un tribunale governativo, non poteva essere che di parte. Ha agito nel quadro di una guerra civile. Non esistevano e non esistono dubbi sui crimini di Saddam. Ma chi l'ha giudicato l'ha fatto con lo spirito di chi partecipa, appunto, a una guerra civile. Gli americani non volevano assumersi quel compito, in quanto "vincitori", e l'hanno lasciato agli iracheni. I quali non erano nelle condizioni di rispettare una procedura normale. Il primo ministro, Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, uno sciita,  stato chiaro quando, subito dopo la sentenza, ha dichiarato che essa servir da esempio ai terroristi. Se il conflitto iracheno, come lasciano chiaramente intendere i generali americani, non sembra risolvibile sul piano militare, la condanna a morte (esecutiva immediatamente), compromette qualsiasi, sia pur remota, possibilit di aprire uno spazio politico. Complica senz'altro la situazione.|`|d8a12ecd45be6adbeeb8bd95bc03f486aa	Anche se ha sbagliato non  giusto punirlo con la pena di morte...sarebbe come abbassarci al suo livello...|`|7962bb4d9fe0a6eb1394d827461efb86aa	No alla pena di morte!!

AA10096303	You raise an excellent point, and one I have been making for months.  Ever since Harry Truman fired Douglas MacArthur in 1951, for wanting to chase the Chinese back to Manchuria, civilian rule has been the rule of order in the US.  It was then that the US stopped winning wars.    Civilian leaders don't understand the objectives of war.  During WWII, the objective was unconditional surrender.  Once the civilian government took over, the objective was to fight towards a cease fire or treaty, but not to win.  This theory puts our troops in great danger and caused unnecessary casualties, because the civilian government refused to use the resources we had available, against an inferior enemy.    By doing this, the civilian government evened the playing field and tilted it in favor of the enemy.  He didn't care about military casualties, his decisions were often dictated by surveys and political opposition.  How sad is that! Most importantly, we stopped winning wars!    Somebody has got to tell these boneheads, we have the resources, now use them!|`|65921bae43c78282f4f3a072925834afaa	WIN WHAT????|`|aa5b131863bac913171c95681a9e251faa	its exactly what happened in Vietnam, we could have won that war easily but the Government didn't let them win|`|d1c50104f19ba9e74900adc5f604c73faa	theres no superbowl for armies in life , even if your country is victorious .......if you want to fight without restraint yr in the wrong century ........|`|a238c9f4f3b39e560b25f7251781c2e1aa	Are you suggesting that we give each soldier a nuke and let them do as the please?

I wonder what will those "civilized people" say if it is them who'r placed in the ground zero.
fe5f318067d85a56a1850d5f8c4b788eaa	From what I understand there were 3 undercover officers that claim the two black men tried to use their car as a weapon and one reached for somethign they thought was a weapon.    Dont know if they have any witnesses but, if they can prove that the driver of the car tried to use the vehicle as a weapon then that will help.    Then its a matter of proving they didnt have time to actually see if what passenger reached for was or wasnt a gun, but his action was one not of cease and desist but rather provoking and aggressive.    Then they can argue that one officer who shot the most bullets either felt his life was in jeoprady or fired off so many shots to try to intercept the threat of the car being used and had to shoot off a mag, reload shoot off a mag and reload and shoot again -- which is going to be extremely difficult if the car didnt back up advance forward back up and advance forward again.    Then you get into the empathy factor.  Where the average citizen doesnt know what it is to have to be apolice officer day in day out.    But I think it all comes down to testimony of a witness that proves the action of the cars driver.  like I said -- if the car went back and forth and back again, that could be enough to make justifiable 3 magazines being shot at the car by one officer.  If the car went back and forth, or just in reverse or just forward -- then clearly thats too many reloads to justify.    That means the officer panicked and shot and shot and shot too much to be responsible.  If anything they had containment on the vehicle, and the license plates, and descriptions of the two men.    so this truly becomes a matter of what action the driver took against the officers if any, and at which point in that whole getaway scene did the officers actually indicate they were officers.  Because just having guys say they are the police for no reason isnt good enough in my eyes.    ==== just read the above after typing out my initial answer.    Its funny how we see Al sharpton spotlighting calling for this and that action -- yet forgot to leave ou tht econvenient details that these were both what appears pattern criminals with armed convictions on their sheets.    If the above article is true -- I see the officers getting past it.  Would be easy to argue -- since the car went back and forth and back.    And with that one officer shooting 31 shots and not 41 shots like I thought it was, it should be okay.  One change of mag in a shootout is pretty justifiable if you see a threat attacking your partner or yourself.    And them 2 casings found -- thats going to be argeuable.  As well as the Pot found, and the others that got away.    I see it a lengthy trial, but I wouldnt convict the officers.  Especially with men who both had armed robbery convictions in the past.

The blaze of gunfire lasted just 10 seconds outside the seedy Kalua Cabaret strip club in South Jamaica early Saturday. But it ended the life of 23-year-old, unarmed Queens dad Sean Bell, who was set to marry his high-school sweetheart and the mother of his two young daughters hours after his bachelor party at the club.    Dramatic new details of the deadly mayhem include the undercover cop at one point climbing onto the hood of Bell's car - his gun drawn and his police shield around his neck - screaming, "Police! Turn off your car! Let me see your hands!" said sources who talked to some of the cops involved in the shooting.    When Bell then tried to run down the plainclothes officer - twice - the cop began shooting, with some of his 11 bullets piercing the rear window of the man's Nissan Altima, the sources said.    This left the cop's backup unit - which was just arriving on the scene amid shattering glass and the undercover's shouts of "He's got a gun!" - thinking they were being fired upon from inside the vehicle. That's when they returned fire with another 39 bullets. One 12-year veteran, a narcotics detective, pumped 31 bullets, authorities said.    The sources recounted step-by-step how quickly things spiraled out of control after a dispute inside the club involving one of Bell's associates.    According to the sources, two undercovers were at the strip joint as part of the NYPD's new Club Enforcement Initiative. The program was started after the July slaying of 18-year-old Jennifer Moore of New Jersey, who partied at a Chelsea club before being abducted, raped and killed in a Weehawken hotel.    The undercovers, who usually worked in Manhattan, were on the last night of their two-month Queens job to try to nail the Kalua and other clubs on such violations as drugs and underage prostitution.    Inside the club, one of the plainclothes cops sat next to a woman he thought was a hooker and might proposition him, the sources said.    Suddenly, a burly man approached them and told the woman that he had heard she had gotten into a fight with a group of guys earlier in the club. It was unclear what it was over.    The man said, " 'Don't worry, baby, I got you covered,' and he takes her hand, and he rubs it across [the gun in] his waistband," a source said. "Then he tells her, 'That's what I'm here for.' "    It's unclear how the man smuggled his weapon past the metal detector outside the club. He likely was a regular who knew the bouncer at the door and may have worked there part time, helping with security, the sources said.    The undercover then went outside the club and radioed his backup to tell them there was a man inside with a gun. It was around 3:30 a.m.    While the undercover was outside, the suspect came out along with the girl and others, since it was around closing time.    The undercover watched as an argument erupted between Bell's group, which included three male pals and the beefy man with the gun, and four other men - with the woman in the middle of them, the sources said.    The woman was overheard saying to the men arguing with Bell's pals, "I'm not doing you all. I'll do one or two, but not all," according to the sources.    Around the same time, the undercover said he heard Bell's friend Joseph Guzman tell his buddies, "Yo, get my gun! Get my gun! Let's get my gun from the car! Yeah, we're gonna f- - - him up!" the sources said.    The undercover, thinking there was about to be a drive-by shooting in front of the club involving Bell's group, followed Guzman, Bell and two others to their car.    "It's getting hot! Something's going to happen! Something's going down!" the undercover radioed to his backup.    He hurried to the front of Bell's Altima, which was parked on the side of nearby Liverpool Street, and jumped in front of it.    That's when the undercover put his right leg up on the hood of the Altima and began screaming that he was a cop, the sources said.    The cop was leaning over the hood of the car to try to see the hands of the people inside and make sure they didn't have any guns, they said. But Bell floored the gas pedal and headed for the cop, the sources said, striking him and badly cutting his knee.    One of the Altima's passengers - who possibly had a gun - jumped out of the back of the car, the sources said.    Around the same time, an unmarked Toyota Camry driven by a plainclothes police lieutenant and another cop behind him pulled up, but overshot Bell's car. A police van with an officer and the narcotics detective then managed to block Bell's car in.    Bell's Altima first struck the police van in the driver's desperate bid to escape, then backed up and struck the roll-down metal doors of a commercial building behind him. He then revved his car again toward the undercover - which prompted the cop to scream, "He's got a gun!" and start firing, according to the sources, with the bullets passing through Bell's car.    "The undercover thought they had more than one gun. He thought they would do anything to get away. He was yelling, 'Let me see your hands!' " one source said.    The other cops, thinking they were under attack, started firing at the car, too.    At one point, the detective thought his gun had jammed and so reloaded his magazine and emptied the clip again at the car, firing 31 bullets.    Bell was killed, Guzman critically injured, and a third friend, Trent Benefield, was shot. They are expected to live.    Benefield later told a friend from his hospital bed that he and his|`|AA10113949	from the article, it sounds completely justifiable, especially since   most black guys that look like thugs have guns, and they blame the white race for slavery and the fact that they are lazy. With convictions like that, and the fact they tried to ram the cops, the cops should walk.

Prodi pur di accontentare le varie componenti della sua maggioranza ha scontentato tutti mettendo le mani intasca agli italiani che gi da qualche anno si trovano a dover fare i conti con uninflazione reale che ha dilapidato il potere dacquisto di salari e pensioni.    Azione Sociale ritiene che gli italiani sono di fronte ad una vera e propria stangata che non meritavano, che non va a colpire i ricchi ma le numerose famiglie,  le quali gi tanti sacrifici hanno dovuto sostenere in questi anni. Come i precedenti governi  continua il coordinatore regionale - Prodi non ha voluto invertire la rotta iniziando a colpire i molti  miliardari di Stato che in Italia abbondano vergognosamente. E poi perch nella finanziaria  previsto il regalino di 30 milioni di euro a Radio Radicale? Il solito privato favoritismo a danno dei contribuenti.    Lesempio che per As casca a pennello  quello dellamato ex Capo dello Stato Ciampi, il quale  riceve ogni anno 1,5 milioni di euro, lequivalente di due pensioni accumulate, e la paga da senatore a vita, mentre lo stipendio di milioni di lavoratori a fatica arriva alle 1000 euro al mese.    Azione Sociale quindi promuove una prima mobilitazione che vedr impegnati nel prossimo fine settimana i militanti in tutto il Veneto con dei gazebo per una raccolta di firme contro la finanziaria. Firme che saranno consegnate nelle mani dei Prefetti a testimoniare il diffuso malcontento verso una manovra infame che non va nellinteresse del popolo ma solo a sanare le conflittualit programmatiche allinterno di una coalizione politica della quale auspichiamo una fine precoce.|`|5ebd9885aa04e69ace8c61c49f57304aaa	Bufalo, bufalo.|`|3b7a097e5322e0798c3c9f310d58e570aa	e i soldi sono tutto??Comunque in Italia non servono tutti quei soldi.|`|61b443c7b68ea95e95f7f3bc796aa2adaa	ciampi ha la pensione di senatore a vita, di preciso non so ma comunque sar li piu o meno ciao|`|7992b2071b8460c1dd6006bdea0bcfc7aa	bufala...|`|d6c8796efaaa359d5f26a20592e65f16aa	bufala drogata da qualche parlamenrare trovato positivo dalle iene|`|bc1a0d41e4a647f360fa5d40d6327e9daa	Notizie sicure si possono avere solo quando vengono pubblicate le denunce dei redditi dei nostri governanti, cosa che avviene ogni anno con i dati di due anni addietro.

These vile individuals should be treated with the disdain, contempt and hatred with which the British people treated fascism in the 1930s and 1940s.

Ritengo (quello si) che gli stipendi dei parlamentari siano esagerati (sostanzialmente ricevono paghe astronomiche a spese del Paese) e non solo! Godono di extra esageratamente di lusso... Senza contare che possono legittimamente godere di una (bella) pensione e (relativo TFR) quasi immediatamente, visto che  sufficiente rimanere in carica per una legislatura (pensa un po')... Vi  una ragione storica (oltre che giuridica) a tutto questo: ti ricordo che inizialmente solo chi era di ricca famiglia poteva permettersi di sostenere le spese che la posizione di parlamentare richiedeva... La possibilit di stipendi che superassero l'entit di quelli percepiti da lavori redditizi trova giustificazione nella constatazione che tutti (ricchi e non) debbano avere la possibilit concreta di poter sostenere le spese connesse all'esercizio del lavoro di parlamentare. Ovviamente gli intenti erano in "buona fede". L'aspetto giuridico  strettamente legato a quello storico-economico. Poich, secondo la costituzione, siamo tutti uguali di fronte alla legge, e poich alla Repubblica spetta l'onere di rimuove gli ostacoli economici... mi pare ovvio che, per evitare una inaccettabile discriminazione tra chi  ricco (e potrebbe permettersi la carriera parlamentare) e chi  povero... ai parlamentari vengano garantite tutta una serie di agevolazioni (oltrech un buono stipendio). Ovvio che tutto questo  giusto... tutt'altra cosa  che i nostri parlamentari ne hanno approfittato schifosamente... garantendosi stipendi ed extra da far paura!|`|164ef5c751397a8cc0883633d0dd813faa	Sono daccordo, poi in Italia ci sono i parlamentari pi pagati al mondo (il doppio o il trliplo degli altri grandi paesi) e oltre all'enorme stipendio hanno treni aerei autostrade ecc. gratis e segretari e autisti e scorte e un sacco di altri privilegi e, visto che sono quasi mille fra senatori e deputati la spesa per lo stato e piuttosto conisderevole|`|fe13ea8bb4de83f94d8488c2b36a2531aa	Finalmente non abbiamo pi politici di professione ed il paese starebbe meglio!!!!!!!|`|ab9c173cca5e9554b4374ba08d19e59daa	Sarebbe giusto, ma purtroppo sappiamo ke nn accadr mai.|`|412885ee985da303a5b66281588b8ac5aa	No non lo sarebbe. I Greci introdussero le retribuzioni alle cariche politiche per permettere a tutti di accedervi, non solo a chi gi guadagnava con altre attivit o era comunque ricco di famiglia, ma anche al povero contadino che non avrebbe mai lasciato il suo campicello per governare Atene gratis (chi dava da mangiare a lui e ai suoi figli?). Le retribuzioni in politica sono dunque un cardine della democrazia e permettono a tutti quanti l'accesso (almeno in teoria) alle cariche.

Il sabato e la domenica spesso deve presenziare in quanto amministratore a convegni, inaugurazioni ecc.

Cicerone ci spiega come Verre, governatore della Sicilia, si arricchisse a spese del fisco, per aver rubato alle casse dello stato venivano condannati in tanti politici, ognuno che arrivava al potere, poteva impadronirsi del bottino di guerra e diventava immensamente ricco. Insomma, al massimo, arrivati al potere, non si facevano retribuire dall'erario romano. Ma dovevano pagare i popoli sottoposti, e tanto, fino a farli scoppiare dalla ricchezza. E il bottino delle guerre ingrassava i politici comandanti. Non c' nessun paese al mondo, n c' stato mai, dove i "mandarini" come in Cina, gli Alcade, in Amerca del Sud, I maragi in India, e insomma tutti quelli che amministrano non si arricchiscano.  I pochissimi che non prendono soldi vogliono per tutto il potere e depredano gli altri della libert.  Nelle dittature, c' molta pi corruzione. I gerarchi fascisti, per esempio, si arricchivano enormemente, nell'Italia fascista, cosi come i gerarchi di Hitler, o per esempio, i vari generali seguaci dei dittatori in America del Sud. Solo che nelle dittature non si pu dire a un gerarca che  ladro, o che si arricchisce, perch allora oltre alla libert ti toglie pure la vita.|`|b3b1f24ec6706aa6a6dbf92b368d68c5aa	E' verissimo che i loro stipendi sono elevatissimi equindi sono d'accordissimo con un loro ridimensionamento, consideriamo anche per le spese che sono costretti a sostenere prima ancora di essere eletti (e non mi riferisco alle mazzette...tanto per risp ai male pensanti), nonch per la maggior parte di loro si parla di un lavoro che dura al max 5 anni (non tutti vengono rieletti e soprattutto  cos solo se le camere non vengono sciolte prima della scadenza del mandato). Insomma sono del parere che gli stipendi sono giustamente alti ma naturalemente hanno bisogno di una drastica riduzione.  Quello che proporrei sarebbe invece l'abolizione delle pensioni d'oro..le pensioni (per chiunque) non dovrebbero superare i 3000 euro! questa mi sembra una misura certamente pi efficace!|`|2dd752fc80272fff0bac9acf4369922eaa	sono convinto che il problema sia filosofico:  l'essere parlamentare dovrebbe essere quasi una missione, e per questo non andrebbero create le condizioni perche' in molti lo considerino un punto d'arrivo!  oggi la carriera politica e' diventata un lavoro, e questo mi pare inaccettabile. tanto piu' che non e' il merito a decidere, ma gruppi di potere e clientele.    per tornare ai romani, la figura dl duce aveva pieni poteri ma durata limitata: se il parlamentare non potesse ripresentarsi per piu' di una volta, ad esempio, alle cariche pubbliche, saprebbe di non potersi trovare un posticino comodo e dovrebbe darsi da fare seriamente.  ma il problema di fondo credo che sia etico, e questa materia sta proprio scomparendo in italia e nel mondo, a tutti i livelli .....|`|9f3ec0abfc2f6a29efd3f8596b81b2b3aa	forse un giorno quando su marte troveranno l'acqua....

His name is David Kuo, a conservative Christian who also worked for Bennett and Ashcroft.    In the book, he describes how the Bush Administration would talk about conservative religious leaders behind their backs, laughingly referring to them as "The Nuts."      National Christian leaders received hugs and smiles in person and then were dismissed behind their backs and described as ridiculous, out of control, and just plain goofy, Kuo writes.    He describes how Bush and Rove basically used the Christians to win political points.    The offices primary mission, providing financial support to charities that serve the poor, never got the presidential support it needed to succeed, according to the book.    Keep in mind, this is a CHRISTIAN CONSERVATIVE writing this book.

All those Obama loving people will find out soon enough how much he cares about them.|`|axHyoVqGaa	He will react the way he always reacts.  He will try to shift blame to someone else.  Now that Bush is out of office, Obama will have to find another scapegoat and that is exactly what he tried to do earlier this week when he was coming under fire for his stimulus plan.  However, this time he bit off more than he could chew when he targeted Rush because unlike Bush, Rush has no problems defending himself and pointing out the flaws in Obama's plan.  I have a feeling that it won't be long until we see the fairness doctrine being presented to legislators for consideration.|`|4VNu06Nfaa	I don't think he cares about that at this point,

I was terribly disappointed to see the quality of men he nominated. Two, if I recall correctly, dropped out of running because of issues of corruption. The Treasury is being run by a man who failed to pay his income taxes. In my opinion, this is not what Obama promised the nation.    Also his bailout program is pure socialism. There is very little there to stimulate the economy. It appears to me that he is using the fear of the recession to pass socialist programs without their receiving any serious consideration by the people or congress.    He has already changed his mind. During the elections, he was ready to bring change. Now that he is elected "It's only going to get worse before it gets better".    Personally, I think he will blame this on Bush for the next four years. As much Bush Bashing as there is, it might work.

How the hell can you make an assumption that terrorists do not use human shields? Although not shown in the much watched movie, "Black Hawk Down" that's just what they those people did do. They do it in the Middle East very often. Human life isn't valued the same in their culture, thus they can crash planes into buildings killing men, women, and children and think it a service to God. Hezbollah has killed so many Israeli civilians with their suicide bombs. You think a bomber ever hesitated because they saw women and children on the bus? The same is true in Iraq, terrorists kill anyone, any age, any religion, any race, because they don't care about the means, only the end -  which is a world submitted to Islam. So you can convert or die, or shut the **** up and let people like us who aren't afraid to stand and fight do our job. I'm sick of hearing ignorant civilians bitching about the war and making terrorists out to be the victims. You people are just as stupid as the Vietnam era public. You swallow whatever the media says and make the enemy out to be victimized. I thank God for those better than you who fought to give you freedom of speech, I chose to stand with them even if it means death will come to me soon. I would rather die and be among those honored than among fools who take for granted the freedoms afforded them by the efforts of better men and women.

And if you looked around a bit, its well-known that the Lebanese government do not support Hezbollah and want to call for a ceasefire.

The Coast Guard is a part of the Dept. of Homeland Security and is responsible for the security of the US coasts, port security, marine safety, and marine search and rescue.  Its a very gender integrated organization. There are probably more O-5 and up females in operational commands than any other branch of the armed forces, but there are few formalities observed between the O's and the E's. Most work together in a team.   They just transitioned to what they call an ODU uniform which is the same as a BDU. Its dark blue and is the every day working uniform. All rank is displayed on the collars. A unit ball cap for a cover and boots. They also have the "tropical blue" long uniform which is similar to the Air Force uniform, light blue shirt, dark blue trousers, clarino black shoes and either a combination, garrison or a unit ball cap for a cover. Officers usually wear shoulder devices and enlisted wear collar devices on the Tropical Blues.  They are in desperate need of trained medical personnel!

He needs to do this by requesting his case be transferred to another lawyer, possibly a public defender if he cannot afford his own. There is a probability then that the new lawyer may be able to take up the reins and uncover new evidence supporting your friend's case.     You say that the attorney will not return your calls, but it is probably the case that he is respecting the client / lawyer confidentiality rule and cannot disclose matters to you unless your friend directs him to do this.    The way forward on this is to contact your friend and see if he is happy with the conduct of his attorney. Also ask him if he could instruct the attorney to keep you advised on developments in his case.    My point is that times are traumatic for friends of someone in custody, but your concerns about the conduct of his case might be eased a little if you knew what was going on...only your friend can authorise this, if he wants to.

Avete la mente ottenebrata dalla politica e non vi rendete conto che mentre paesi con un governo civile come l'India non fanno paura se hanno la bomba atomica perch la tengono solo per difesa, paesi con governi folli come l'Iran sono pericolosi.   Vi siete gi dimenticati la guerra tra Iran e Iraq? Nel 1980 L'Iraq attacc l'Iran e in un sol giorno, colle sue armi chimiche, (sostenuto da arabi e occidentali, come vedete le armi chimiche le aveva) stermin 5000 iraniani... in un sol giorno. Quelle armi chimiche per non le us solo contro gli iraniani ma pure contro gli iracheni curdi, i suoi connazionali tanto per dire che tipino .  Le armi a Saddam le fornirono in ordine di quantitativo: Russia, Stati Uniti, Germania, Francia e Italia (siamo tra i maggiori esportatori di armi in Europa). Questa guerra cost circa un milione di vittime iraniane e un milione di vittime irachene.  Il capo iraniano Ahmadinejad, durante la guerra Iran Iraq, era capo di stato maggiore della Sesta Armata delle Guardie della Rivoluzione Islamica, tristemente famosa per le operazioni Martirio, con cui si gettavano ragazzini di 15 anni con un fucile e poche pallottole, facendone un massacro generale, prima che l'Onu li portasse alla pace senza vinti n vincitori.  Una delle prime azioni di governo di  Ahmadinejad fu quella di ordinare la separazione degli ascensori tra uomini e donne negli edifici comunali, la seconda di istituire centri di distribuzione di cibo per i diseredati, la terza di comprare i servizi di Khan per riattivare il programma nucleare iraniano. Di investimenti per il popolo nisba, ma nei paesi arabi, tranne alcuni,  normale. Alle proteste della comunit internazionale il popolo iraniano fa quadrato attorno alui che con sparate antiebraiche e antioccidentali rinfocola l'estremismo. Comunque a marzo dovrebbe esserci l'esplosione atomica sotterranea, identica a quella che dette inizio alla corsa nucelarte del pakistan negli anni 90. ll mondo aspetta con il fiato sospeso, nel frattempo, per timore di sopralluoghi occidentali, le unit scientifiche iraniane si spostano ogni 24 ore.

Da allora, il nuovo fondamentalismo nemico acerrimo dei Paesi liberi  rappresentato dagli Stati islamici. L'Iran, governato, non dimentichiamolo, da una teocrazia arci-fondamentalista, rappresenta il maggior pericolo non per Bush o per gli Usa, ma per il Mondo. Permettergli di avere l'atomica significa dare loro l'autorizzazione di bombardare Israele, innanzitutto, ed il resto del Mondo che non dovesse accettare la sharia e la colonizzazione col jihad, poi. Ecco perch dovremmo opporci. Ma tanto, mi sa che  troppo tardi. L'Iran avr la sua bella bomba atomica, con buona pace dei finti pacifisti, che si ritroveranno bombardati. Ma chiss che non decidano di aderire tutti alla Nuova Potenza Islamica Mondiale, come fecero nel 1938 con Hitler.....  p.s. La storia di Israele non  proprio come l'ha raccontata qualcuno nelle risposte che mi hanno preceduto. So che  arduo farlo, ma datevi un'occhiata alla storia del Paese ebraico (la trovate anche su diversi blog): ne scoprirete delle belle. Ad esempio, che i palestinesi non esistevano fino a qualche decennio fa e che la zona era abitata da ebrei e cristiani molto pi che da musulmani fino al 1950 circa....

My favorite Tom Kean quotes:    "Donald Rumsfeld has to go," Kean said.  "It has become clear to me in recent days that what is needed is a change of direction, policy and attitude at the highest levels of our defense establishment in Washington."    There are many things that people think have been done that simply haven't been done. Our leadership has been distracted in this country. Some of the failures are shocking.    While the terrorists are learning and adapting, our government is still moving at a crawl.    The terrorists are smart because they will go where the security is the weakest.

I find it silly to be quite honest that they wanted him dead for this crime and not the "real" crime against humanity. In effect all he was really doing was cracking down on assasins, if anything they should have waited for the trial that really mattered. The part thats even better is his underlings got a stay on their execution... Probably the worst part about hurrying this thing was it got all botched up, the Sunni's took it as a lynching, now he's a martyr and the situation is almost worse than it was before. They should have run he situation a whole lot differently.     As for the 150000 ish Kurds... what more you wanna do to the guy ?  hes dead.

They are no better or worst that anyone else.|`|7ddc6d992e528b81434b69589c61bb06aa	Depends on the circumstances.    If they use their position as an officer, and person of trust, to commit their crime, the punishment (in my opinion) should be much more severe    Example:    A police person, uses his badge to gain entry to the house of a woman, he then murders.    He used his status as a police officer to gain her trust, and then murdered her.    She would not normally have let 'just any' man into her home.    (My example is a little extreme, but there are a million and one small, medium, and large ways to abuse power...)|`|AmylIhvdaa	Not unless they abused their position as a police officer to enable them to commit the crime. In many states there are harsher punishment for anyone in a place of public trust who misuses that trust to commit certain crimes.

Biggest issue that concern us is unresolved status (Kosovars want independent state), second issue is unemployment, around 50% are unemployed, electricity is the other problem. Bosnia is very different from Kosova. Bosnia is divided country in three parts. Bonsinan part, croatian part and serbian par in republica srpska. in bosnia is very difficult for goverment to take any action in foreign policy as I mention because bosnia is devided.      But the main problem that Kosova and Bosnia have are serbs because serbs are everybodys problem, lol|`|542ccee62d525f9e1c86999dd500b15caa	Kosovo - big issue is independence that Albanians want, status of minority (including Serbs) is very bad, and economy (since it was the most underdeveloped part of ex-Yu).  Bosnia - problem is not in divided government, that is set out to be problem by muslim nationalists. They want centralized government since they are majority in Bosnia and in that way they would be able to have control. Right now, according to constitution, it's impossible. Raising issue is always nationalism, and economy of course.  One of the problems that comes in the spot light these days are muslim fanatics, that are called "vehabije". Those people want to teach and practice islam in arab way, which is traditionally different from bosnian islam. They become very strong and islam community in Bosnia now have big problems with them, which result in fights with local muslims in some rural areas. High religious authorities of muslims now feel endangered by "vehabije" and it will be interesting to see how will this end. It is not happening only in Bosnia, it is also problem in areas where muslims are majority in Serbia, and as I hear in Kosovo too (they are supporters of Great Albania and Kosovo independence).

zH0h0Tr0aa	Step 1: Introduction  Anybody -- you, me, the President, can write a bill; but only a member of Congress (House or Senate) can introduce the bill for consideration. The Representative or Senator who introduces the bill becomes its "Sponsor." Other legislators who support the bill or work on its preparation can ask to be listed as "Co-sponsors." Important bills usually have several Co-sponsors.     Four basic types of legislation are considered by Congress: Bills, Simple Resolutions, Joint Resolutions, and Concurrent Resolutions.     A bill or resolution has officially been introduced when it has been assigned a number (H.R.   for House Bills or S.   for Senate Bills), and printed in the Congressional Record by the Government Printing Office.     Step 2: Committee Consideration  All bills and resolutions are "referred" to one or more House or Senate committees according their specific rules.  Standing Rules of the US Senate  Rules of the US House of Representatives  House Committees  Senate Committees     Step 3: Committee Action  The committee considers the bill in detail. For example, the powerful  House Ways and Means Committee and Senate Appropriations Committee consider a bill's potential impact on the Federal Budget. "Can we afford this thing?"     If the committee approves the bill, it moves on in the legislative process. Committees reject bills simply by not acting on them. Bills that fail to get committee action are said to have "died in committee." Many do.     Step 4: Subcommittee Review  The committee sends some bills to a subcommittee for further study and public hearings. Just about anyone can present testimony at these hearings. Government officials, industry experts, the public, anyone with an interest in the bill can give testimony either in person or in writing. Notice of these hearings, as well as instructions for presenting testimony is officially published in the Federal Register.     Step 5: Mark Up  If the subcommittee decides to report (recommend) a bill back to the full committee for approval, they may first make changes and amendments to it. This process is called "Mark Up." If the subcommittee votes not to report a bill to the full committee, the bill dies right there.     Step 6: Committee Action -- Reporting a Bill  The full committee now reviews the deliberations and recommendations of the subcommittee. The committee may now conduct further review, hold more public hearings, or simply vote on the report from the subcommittee. If the bill is to go forward, the full committee prepares and votes on its final recommendations to the House or Senate. Once a bill has successfully passed this stage it is said to have been "ordered reported" or simply "reported."     Step 7: Publication of Committee Report  Once a bill has been reported (See Step 6:) a report about the bill is written and published. The report will include the purpose of the bill, its impact on existing laws, budgetary considerations, and any new taxes or tax increases that will be required by the bill. The report also typically contains transcripts from public hearings on the bill, as well as the opinions of the committee for and against the proposed bill.     Step 8: Floor Action -- Legislative Calendar  The bill will now be placed on the legislative calendar of the House or Senate and scheduled (in chronological order) for "floor action" or debate before the full membership. The House has several legislative calendars. The Speaker of the House and House Majority Leader decide the order in which reported bills will be debated. The Senate, having only 100 members and considering fewer bills, has only one legislative calendar.     Congressional Schedules and Calendars     Step 9: Debate  Debate for and against the bill proceeds according to the rules of the House or Senate.     Rules of Consideration and Debate     Step 10: Voting  Once debate has ended and any amendments to the bill have been approved, the full membership will vote for or against the bill. The vote may be a voice vote or a roll-call vote.     Methods of Voting     Step 11: Bill Referred to Other Chamber  Bill approved by one "chamber" of Congress (House or Senate) are now sent to the other chamber where they will follow pretty much the same track of committee to debate to vote. The other chamber may approve, reject, ignore, or amend the bill.     Step12: Conference Committee  If the second chamber to consider a bill changes it significantly, a "conference committee" made up of members of both chambers will be formed. The conference committee works to reconcile differences between the Senate and House versions of the bill. If the committee cannot agree, the bill simply dies. If the committee does agree on a compromise version of the bill, they prepare a report detailing the changes they have proposed. Both the House and Senate must approve the report of the conference committee or the bill will be sent back to them for further work     Step 13: Final Act|`|gIEWfDj3aa	Congress first.  Then Executive.      For major initiatives, regulatory language must then be developed that delivers the intention of the legislation.  An example of a requlatory authority is CMS.  This process can also be very involved and include back and forth with public comment.    "Laws" are set by the regulation, the legislation and then by precedent.|`|AA12266367	Watch School House Rock|`|TtZhVhldaa	Lobbyist tell our congressmen what they want and then both houses draft a bill that they're told then add as much as they can steal.

Poor people make more poor people and if we don't stop paying them to have babies then they will only be the poor and the super rich.|`|KAKXZw0Qaa	If you do not have medical ins then you are the working poor .|`|t3QAaSN9aa	It has generally been perceived in the past that poor people don't have the option to purchase health insurance but that middle class people do.  The reality is that many middle class people can't afford the premiums and some are turned down because of pre-existing conditions.  You appear to be advocating for universal health care.|`|jEqISBnQaa	Stop making sense!|`|BLMh0dG6aa	Your in luck the VP. is very concerned about the middle-class, I think too much so.    http://www.whitehouse.gov/StrongMiddleCl...|`|TKbYavhzaa	Yeah, good thing we don't have a nationalized health care plan.  Then small businesses wouldn't go broke having to pay for their employees health care, and people working 3 part time jobs might be able to go to the ER without selling their car first.|`|b423d42c76a871f7b36abba90dc4c41daa	Generally speaking,"middle class" people can afford medical care if they choose to give up one of the new SUVs and drive a used one instead...Poor/disabled people usually need at least basic medical care in order to just stay alive.Its for the same reason Rich people don't get food stamps...|`|BQdXnCcHaa	How about we just restrict it to American citizens only or those here on visas? Then we can start looking at the 20 percent of waste in the system before Obama forces us all to join?|`|lXOkRTPaaa	Instead of thinking about it as one over the other, it should be both. Everyone should have access to quality affordable health care. This is what voters elected Obama to do.|`|ajPRVnFVaa	Good point but Medicaid is not just for the poor.  The disabled also have to rely on medicaid.  Unfortunately they have to grouped with the most unneedy..|`|RL3EVSW2aa	because they think the ones who work can buy their own band aids , pain killers , ointments, they think that's all we need|`|5gG2OfHIaa	Those who work should fare better than people who are professional welfare recipients.  I agree with you, Mr. Taxpayer.|`|5b85793bae21d013c789850655fa694caa	This is actually a relatively new problem.  Before the past sixteen years businesses offered health care insurance with no problem, and most people were covered through work.  If you went private, it was still affordable.  Governments move slowly and healthcare for the general population was derailed when Hillary got her fanny handed to her trying to find out how to reform it.  Since then the lobbyists for the insurance companies have torpedoed all efforts to find a way out.  They just raise the rates,  they have all show profits that grow and grow.  So where once it was a lower class thing to be without insurance, now the middle class, which hangs on tightly to the idea that it can function without government help, now finds itself without help and going bankrupt.  Change will come, but only when enough people are endangered so we see that its really all our problem, not just the poor, or the unemployed, its us.      Lets get one thing straight, insurance for two healthy people, costs $1360 PER MONTH.  Thats not buying a flat screen tv, thats like buying a flat screen tv every month.  Its more than a payment on an SUV.  I pay more for insurance than I do in taxes.  But I can't afford the costs for complete coverage so I have some dopey discount thing, which only covers me if I get sick on alternate Thursdays in Arizona, and I live in NY.  But its all I can afford.  The next lower thing pays only for hospitalization, not doctors or medicine, not tests, just the bed.  That $734 per month.|`|RMjcHfGTaa	I have never had a problem paying taxes to support programs like Medicaid or food stamps as long as they go to support:    The elderly who can't work and live on SS, the mentally handicap, the disabled, veterans who can't work, wards of the state, orphans, foster kids, and a few others.  I believe that was the intent of why welfare was created. To help those that can't help themselves.  I believe this is a moral obligation of society.    But those that are merely poor because they refuse to work.  The welfare kings and queens out there and we all know who they are, don't deserve a damn thing.|`|b2efe4c24f079486fbaff579f92c1c00aa	I agree, I have looked all through this stimulus and I see My husband and I will get $1000.00.  That is it out of probably a trillion by the time it is over.  Insurance is our largest expense and increasing greatly the older you get.  No employer coverage so we have to get independent coverage which is ludicrously high.  So we work and get no help. Income in the $50,000 a year range. While the poor,research for Global Warming, community activists etc. are getting money with no accountability or oversight.  The middle class gets the screw every time!|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Well the majority of "middle class" workers wihtout insuracne, have cable, internet, flat screen, new cras, etc, etc. Could you poosibly fathom that these people have their priorities mixed up?

It's a common saying that to keep conversation civilized, one should avoid two topics of conversation at all costs...... politics and religion.   These are two very lively bucking horses that if you choose to ride them, you had better hold on for dear life and have the resilience and quick reflexes that are required to make it through any 20 minute conversation in these areas........ and still be left standing or, rather, remain in the saddle unscathed.

f4ef0b3a83cc1af75c8cb10f391cb5c9aa	Your ex has no legal right to your child. A name change does not change paternity.  Bio dad could not legally have signed away his parental rights without your then husband adopting the child. Informal agreements like that are not legally binding.  You cannot give your ex any legal rights to this child without the child's biological father's consent.    Giving you full custody of the child and agree to a name change do not mean that he signed away his parental rights.     In  order for a guy's parental rights to be severed, someone else has to adopt the child. The legal premise here is that every child has the right to a father. The bio dad is still the child's legal father.

0f6a1cdae0a3ce3617b1109a091741bdaa	Although the bill is still in the process so is subject to change, as it stands today, I am against it. Not in total...as I realize that we do need to take steps to aid businesses so that they do not lay off people...and we need to create new jobs so those who are unemployed can be rehired or find new jobs.    Your comment about the re-sodding of the Washington Mall (which I believe has already been removed from the proposed bill)  is characteristic of the many areas of the bill that I disagree with also. I am not arguing that money going to the National Endowment for the Arts, for re-sodding the mall etc. are not good things that we would like to see done eventually, but in this crisis situation, I believe it is necessary that we totally restrict money going anywhere unless that money is going to give us a substantial increase in permanent job growth or retention. It is making jobs secure that will encourage people to spend instead of save...and it is that spending that will bring our businesses back to normal operations. It is the suggestion by many that the entire stimulus bill be targeted to what were healthy businesses before the drop in customer spending....either in the form of direct assistance or tax cuts. At the same time, tax cuts to the individuals who would normally pay taxes every year would help also I suppose....but it is job retention and job growth that is key to the success of the effort. The money should be used to make sure businesses are not forced to lay off employees. Those layed off employees won't spend money that they don't need to spend....and as long as the lay offs continue, the rest of the people in our country are not going to spend either...because they are afraid that they are "next". to be layed off.    So in essence, assisting healthy businesses is the key.|`|uithGZOwaa	Oink, oink.      ADD:  It will only make things worse.

Some are even getting out of business esp. small businesses because you have to work 80 hours a week just to keep the doors open.  It is not worth it.

If I were invited, I would go.  Even if I were invited and given some kind of honor or award, I would not go to the White House with him in it.  I would be too saddened.  As Michelle Obama was proud of her country for the first time in her life, I am ashamed of my country for the first time in my life.  That man is not my president.

To his credit, though, Obama at least has the stated goal to earn the respect of other countries rather than exercising dominance with military power, maybe the US can be a leader in things besides bombs and soldiers.

2425cc2cee9552b0f1a53567bfd23012aa	You got good definitions from the first answer. I'll base my opinion on the the death penalty system in practice.   The only purpose it serves is retribution or revenge, it is seriously flawed in application and there is a serious and continuing risk of executing innocent people.  And, it costs much more than life in prison.  Sources below.    The most disturbing thing is that innocent people have been sentenced to death.  Lots of them. 130 people wrongfully convicted people were sentenced to death and were lucky to be exonerated and released, eventually. DNA, available in less than 10% of all homicides, cant guarantee we wont execute innocent people. Obviously, if someone is convicted and later found innocent you can release him from prison, but not from the grave.    A big surprise: The death penalty is much more expensive than life in prison. The high costs of the death penalty are for the complicated legal process, and the largest costs come at the beginning, for the pre trial process and for the trial itself. The point is to avoid executing innocent people.    Families of murder victims are not unanimous about the death penalty. However, even families who are for the death penalty in principal have testified that the drawn-out death penalty process is painful for them and that life without parole is an appropriate alternative.     Other important facts:   Life without parole, on the books in 48 states, also prevents reoffending. It means what it says, and spending 23 of 24 hours a day locked in a tiny cell is not a picnic. It costs less than the death penalty.     The death penalty doesn't prevent others from committing murder. That is, it is not an effective deterrent. Murder rates are actually higher in states and regions that have it than in those that dont.      There are serious risks with speeding up the process. Over 50 of the innocent people released from death row had already served over a decade. Speed up the process and we will execute innocent people.    The death penalty isn't reserved for the worst crimes, but for defendants with the worst lawyers. It doesn't apply to people with money. When is the last time a wealthy person was on death row, let alone executed?    Unless you ignore all these things, it is hard to support the death penalty.

Crimes that can result in a death penalty are known as capital crimes or capital offenses. The term capital originates from Latin capitalis, literally "regarding the head" (Latin caput). Hence, a capital crime was originally one punished by the severing of the head.    Capital punishment has been practiced in virtually every society, excluding those with state religious proscriptions against it. It is a matter of active controversy in various states, and positions can vary within a single political ideology or cultural region. A major exception is in Europe, where Article 2 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union prohibits the practice|`|Dz0Z3Aogaa	Capital punishment is merited for capital crimes and involves forfeiting your life.  It is legal in ost countries on the face of the Earth today.  It has been used thoughout cultures and throughout history.    It is extrmely effective at reducing crime but has been frowned on since the age of enlightenment.  Also the crimes that were seen as justifying death have become more and more extreme.    If you are writing a paper I would try to hone in on a specific angle.      It is one of the broadest subjects out there.  Focus on "Death for Religious heresy, east and west," "Capital punishment and the international drug trade", "Capital punishment as it effects militry discipline."      If you are an open minded liberal hippy type you can investigate theories on the excessive violence and capital punishment in the late Roman Empire.

Unless your boyfriend is either on the lease, or the landlord accepted money from him at some point, then he has no right to be there. If you engage in repeated disturbances such as loud domestic disputes, that usually is a lease violation and the owner could have you evicted, or at the very least simply not renew your lease. Remember, it's not "your" house. It's the landlord's house, and he's just letting you use it.|`|AA12146958	Yes they can legally bar your boyfriend from the property. And yes they can evict you as you have repeatedly caused trouble.
hcc8fq7jaa	If you continue to violate the terms of your lease, such as by causing disturbances, then you can be evicted. Furthermore, your landlord owns the property, and can very well prohibit certain people from coming on the property if they have caused problems before. You should feel lucky that she's even willing to meet with you at this point. Many landlords are not nearly that patient with tenants. The bigger issue is that you need to grow up, and learn to control yourself and your temper. You also might consider picking a better class of boyfriend.|`|XdGjhbfMaa	If the disturbances are loud enough and/or frequent enough that is grounds for eviction.  If your boyfriend's behavior is affecting the neighbors and causing repeated visits to the property by the police your landlord can bar him from the property (and still evict you, you're responsible for your guests).|`|WD6uLJxvaa	Dont you think your neighbors also pay good money to live there and have a nice quiet existence?|`|227b14cb2ec949a2ecdd4ba7068ff421aa	You can be evicted for any reason as long as you receive 30 days notice.   You better be glad your boyfriend can't come over because it's just going to get you in trouble.|`|jHXUNbYGaa	Yes, she can evict you if she goes through the proper channels. Yes, she can file a no trespassing against your boyfriend because HE is causing problems for others. It IS the landlord's property, not yours. The landlord can basically tell you if it happens again, you will be evicted.
b548e7d83e76abff190cad24e43b0ecaaa	Well, the fact that your landlord has offered to meet you is because she wants to talk about it, most likely she can put an order to prevent him from entering the property , yes she can do that , it is her property after all.     At this point what I think is your landlord is trying to get you to apologize and explain what's going on. I bet she expects you to say you won't have him in your house again or that you won't create problems again. The question is, are you willing to do this?.     To be honest you have to put yourself in your neighbor's and landlord's shoes, here's a girl who has a boyfriend and whenever he gets to her house they yell and scream and the police has to show up to stop them, that's not what you are supposed to be doing. You have to understand why they might not want you there anymore.     If your lease is up or almost up or you are a month to month tenancy they might give you 30 or 60 days notice or they might tell you they wont be renewing your lease. Eviction is a hard , long process and honestly I dont think your landlord wants to go through with it, she is asking you to meet and talk, if you were being evicted you would be receiving a letter.|`|CdTe8MO4aa	maybe your landlord wants to give you a chance   just tell her (nicely) that your bf is staying with you  and you work nights  and your neighbors are always being nosey and complaining|`|2a8f342e5a607281058fdd923f98379faa	Why don't you take responsibility for your action?Why do you want to inconvenience your neighbors?You want to live in a nice place but at the same time you want to trash it for everybody.Last,you will cost your landlord money when everybody else moves out.Find a run down place to live then you will have no complaints from neighbors and you can raise all the hell you want.|`|ZmgrkOF6aa	you are live on channel 4 please dont swear|`|n8UBfhgpaa	You need to look up the tenants act in your state/province. I am not sure what Country you live in so it is different everywhere. I dont think they can legaly stop you from having your b/f over.|`|033a5e91931aa693dfd0d410087ef5e8aa	Hi,  OK I'll give it to you straight.  I'm a Landlord so this is the scoop.  Yes, she can evict you but most likely won't.  The fact that you and your BF have had fights....let's call them what they really are, and it has disrupted the other tenants.  They also pay good money for their units and they are expecting peace and quiet.  You and your BF have cause that peace to be disrupted, which gives them every right to complain and or call the police.  THAT'S A HUGE PROBLEM.  Put yourself in their shoes and see if you'd like that!  Maybe drama is your life style, but it isn't for most normal people.  Yes, the Landlord can keep your BF off the property, and should for the safety and peace of the other tenants.  This is your Landlord business and that's how they put food on their table, and as a Landlord I wouldn't want a couple of fighting idiots driving my other tenants away.  I would evict you or ask you to leave by giving you legal notice to do so.  She may allow you to stay but what's to say your BF doesn't come by acting like an idiot again.  I wouldn't take the chance.  And if you were her you wouldn't either.  You really need to respect other peoples space and peace and quiet.|`|12dQQiaOaa	It seems by your own admission you and your boyfriend have brought this concern upon yourselves. You hopefully can understand how your neighbors feel, just as you would if it were them. Meet with your landlord and work on your ability to handle things in a better manner. If your boyfriend has damaged the property he shouldn't be allowed there no matter how much your rent is. If you fix yourselves first you won't need to worry about an eviction here or your next place of residence!

There are lots of things I wouldn't do but others have the right to do them if they want.

I won't have one, but I defend your right to make your own choice.  It is not a 'liberal' stance.  Many conservatives and moderates also feel the same way.  It is also not a Republican or Democrat issue, it is a human issue.|`|OYtoM9fXaa	I have always found that argument to be so morally and intellectually weak and dishonest as to be laughable.    The ONLY reason to be against abortion is because you know it takes a human life.  There is no other conceivable reason to look at it any differently than a tonsillectomy or liposuction.  If it takes a human life, it is bad.  If you do not believe it takes a life, how is it bad?    If you do believe abortion is morally wrong, why would you support the "right" of another to procure one?  Do you support the right of someone else to rob a bank or to murder grandma for her insurance money, even though you find these acts to be morally questionable?|`|otYOxmnuaa	Because it's their choice...it has nothing to do with you.    "Liberals, if you indeed think that it is immoral or harmful, and you say you wouldn't personally get one"    That's a personal opinion -- a freedom granted to each individual.    "why would you support giving other people the choice to do it?"    Because it's their choice -- not yours.|`|yS0hSFdOaa	I don't think it is immoral or harmful, I would personally get one if I WANTED to, and support anyone who does as well.   What is the point of this question anyway? That your kind wants to try and run others lives and we don't?|`|pVdV4gwgaa	Because its none of my business what she decides to do. After all it's not my body it's hers so who am I to tell her what she can and can't do?|`|FIXKYCIGaa	Why are questions like this always directed at liberals when the majority of Americans, republicans, democrats and independents, are pro choice?    The difference is an inconsistency among conservatives.  They insist that the government stay out of the affairs of the American people, unless it has to do with something as deeply personal as abortion.  If a woman has made the decision that an abortion is what is best for her, based on the totality of the circumstances in her life, then I don't have the right to second guess her and compel her to go through with a pregnancy that she doesn't want.|`|cvPjlv0Paa	I don't think abortion is immoral or harmful. I wouldn't get one, unless I was pregnant and couldn't care for or didn't want the baby. I would support giving other people the chance to do it because it is their life. they should decide if they want the baby, or if they're ready for parenthood. No one likes to get an abortion, but it is sometimes necessary.|`|nNmusYZSaa	For the same reasons I support decriminalization of drugs and prostitution--OD's and STD's only compound the problems, and organized crime gets involved wherever there is prohibition.    Abortion should be safe, legal, and rare.    If it were prohibited, it would only be safe for those wealthy enough to leave the country to obtain one.|`|FX4WhQtKaa	the right to not give birth starts with birth control......if a woman chooses not to use birth control then the right to abortion should be illegal to her.....if someone can't be responsible enough to use protection then how can they be responsible enough to decide the fate of an unborn child.....unprotected sex and abortion rights?...isn't that premeditated  murder?|`|cRDbeUDvaa	I don't believe in SUV's either.

If those kids are born they'll just be a burden to society.  Welfare forever|`|BHeBSGemaa	It's supporting CHOICE. You can say that you would never get an abortion, but you will support other people's choices. It's that simple.|`|lx51F0gzaa	Because it's not my pregnancy or my body, so it isn't my choice.  I can't make the decision for someone else whether going through a pregnancy is the right thing for them.  I can't compel someone to give a baby up for adoption, nor can I compel her to keep a child she can't afford to raise.  Not your embryo, not your fetus, not your baby, not your life... not your choice.    I would never have an abortion.    The United States government, however, has NO authority to prevent me from getting one.    Neither do you.    This isn't about supporting abortion.  This is about maintaining the integrity of the Constitution by limiting the authority the United States government has over our personal decisions.    I find it laughable that the same people who are terrified to allow the government to take over health insurance (because, they claim, the government has no right to decide what medical procedures we have access to) are so eager to have government mandate that abortion, a medical procedure, should be off limits.|`|COFPXYvZaa	just because I don't morally approve of it doesn't mean I choose to asset my beliefs into the faces of people. that's HER choice. that choice affects HER and HER alone. nobody else. that's the point of pro-CHOICE. I don't care what decision the woman makes. I don't know them. they have no relevancy to me. they shouldn't have relevancy to you either. if you don't like abortion, fine. ignore it. don't associate yourself with it. good for you. but keep your morals out of other people who don't want to hear it. mind your own business.    THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT INFRINGE UPON THE PERSONAL LIVES OF PEOPLE. we don't want a government that promotes coercion.
S3ktbzDNaa	Radicalism of all sorts is a threat to people everywhere. You may consider, rather than claiming directly that radical Islam is not a threat, arguing against the proposal that it is a special threat. It may be a special threat for a variety of reasons, but a viable argument to the contrary can certainly be made.    Try looking up the some comparisons between radical Islam and radical Christians. Look into the role of education, science, and general progress in ending movements like the Crusades and the Inquisition. Compare the views of modern radical Islam to fundamentalist Christians in the USA. There are certainly many differences, but painting with broad strokes in a 1 minute speech, comparisons to abortion clinic bombers, among other things, can certainly make powerful points.    Violence in the name of God is always a threat, but is radical Islam any more of a threat than other radicals? Should it be dealt with differently? In some ways, the answer is yes (primarily because of the power structure in places where you find Islamic extremists as oppose to those conditions in which Christians currently live, it was the other way around in the middle ages), but as this is a debate and a 1 minute speech, there's plenty there for you to be able to argue no successfully.

Plan were discovered to attack a dozen "soft" targets (schools, etc) over a period of time.    If you don't mind those odds, then it's not a threat.    edit: Reality has a Liberal Bias doesn't have a credible source because the FBI has stopped hundreds of incidents.
