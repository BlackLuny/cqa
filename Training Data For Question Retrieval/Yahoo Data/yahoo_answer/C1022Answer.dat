I can eat like a pig for a week then play ball a couple of days the next week and drop pounds like crazy. I play full court 4 on 4 for about 3 or 4 hours. An hour a day sounds alright. Start by practicing your shot and chasing your own rebounds if you are playing by yourself. Don't stop running, if you have to atleast jog.

What in your opinion was the best move made this offseason (could be for any team)? -Yankees, getting Tex, AJ, and CC<br>  <br>  3. Who does your team open against? Do you think they'll win on Opening Day? -Mariners, and yes, I hope so!<br>  <br>  4. Are your rivals better or worse than last year? And why? -Probably worse, they lost a few great players<br>  <br>  5. In terms of the baseball season, what are you looking forward to most this year? -My team!<br>  <br>  6. Summarize your team's offseason in one word. -AMAZING:)<br>  <br>  7. A-Rod. We're all sick of hearing about him, but what cities do you think he'll get the most "boos" in (besides Boston, of course)? By Tampa Bay or Angels or Texas.<br>  <br>  8. Are you playing fantasy baseball this year? If you are, what key players do you have on your team? -No<br>  <br>  9. Will your team's chemistry be stronger or weaker this year and why? -Weaker, since theres a lot of new players and trades, but I think they willo grow stronger!<br>  <br>  Bonus: Is there snow on the ground where you live? -Nope, never snows where I live in CA|`|zoEx9ALyaa	I'm a Mets Fan, so please don't get mad at me for anwering this(LOL)<br>  1. Francisco Rodriguez(Although He is Overrated)<br>  2.The Red Sox Locking up Pedroia. He's young, and is a potential 100+ RBI guy. And they have just bought him through his prime and have him for his prime if they don't trade him (WHich is Unlikey)<br>  3. THe Mets Play the Cincinatti Reds. I think THe Mets will win, even if Johan Doesn't pitch opening day, since they're bullpens better.<br>  4. Two Rivals. The Phillies got Raul Ibanez. The Nationals got Adam Dunn, and a whole bunch of other players. (The Marlins Traded Scott Olsen and a couple other guys, and got no one good back) The Braves got Derek Lowe, and he is clearly not a staff ace, and he will never beat Hamels or Santana. (and of course, The Yankees are better, but I won't go into that.)<br>  5. Seeing Manny Play. He's a great player, signed, or agreed, today with L.A., and I want to see him succeed.<br>  6.Pretty<br>  7.Texas. After the news about steroids, Texas fans will be all over him.<br>  8.No<br>  9. Weaker. Alou was a great, great clubhouse guy. There used to be two groups of guys in the locker room, and Alou brought them together. Even though he barely played, his leader ship was great.<br>  Bonus: My snow melted, but there is still snow in the mountains<br>  Just Started Snowing, so yes (for now)|`|l0iCqzlQaa	1, improving the pitching staff and Bullpen<br>  2.

They should win<br>  4- Around the same. The Twins didn't do anything, the Tigers are the same team, but can be better if they stay healthy, and the Indians made some moves but still aren't threatening. The Royals a probably a little better.<br>  5- World Series<br>  6- minor<br>  7- New York<br>  8- Didn't do a draft yet<br>  9- Stronger, since there are a few young guys that got their first chance last year.

Yankees -___-; and maybe the Dodgers lol they wanted ONE guy and FINALLY got him lol<br>  <br>  3. Who does your team open against? Do you think they'll win on Opening Day? Oakland. I hope so! that would be a good way to start off the season<br>  <br>  4. Are your rivals better or worse than last year? And why? A's are stronger in my opinion because they have Holliday and OC is a good leader.. and i'm sure they are gonna give us some competition<br>  <br>  5. In terms of the baseball season, what are you looking forward to most this year? I'm looking forward to playing the Yankees @ home, i wanna see if the angels will do well against them AND most importanty i'm excited to see how well Saunders and Santana will do this year. <br>  <br>  6. Summarize your team's offseason in one word  adequate<br>  <br>  7. A-Rod. We're all sick of hearing about him, but what cities do you think he'll get the most "boos" in (besides Boston, of course)? New York, Texas (with the Rangers) and probably Seattle too all the places he's played for <br>  <br>  8. Are you playing fantasy baseball this year? If you are, what key players do you have on your team? nope<br>  <br>  9. Will your team's chemistry be stronger or weaker this year and why? Chemistry has always been pretty strong we have some nice guys/leaders in the clubhouse i would think :)<br>  <br>  Bonus: Is there snow on the ground where you live? there's no snow in california :(
AA12185087	Theres tons of reasons to love and to hate Al Davis....|`|VVCpJFxtaa	If this was the first coach Al Davis fired in a long time, I would be more sympathetic to Davis. Including the next sacrificial lamb to be the head coach of the Raiders, how many coaches have the Raiders had in the last ten years? Until Al stops playing musical coaches, the Raiders will continue to be a bad football team. Good teams have stability. There is no stability in the Raiders organization other than Al Davis. That is not necessary a good thing.|`|qov5T21Daa	Yea you believe all that? then believe this and its no Joke<br>  <br>  AL Davis hired the Cable guy as head coach! He was introduced by Al and says " I was madder then a deaf-mute playing Bingo, getting Bingo, and trying to holler out Bingo, I tell ya...Kiffen just pissed me off." Then he says "I went jogging last week. I didn't want to, my car broke down in Oakland. I lost eight pounds and my rims" Then they asked if he'll make changes to the playbook, and he says "I don't play with myself. I was cleaning it once and it went off." <br>  |`|QKP6iGniaa	If the Raiders were winning and Lane Kiffen lied to him would he be fired?|`|3ae8OQ96aa	 Al should walk the sidelines with Bart tickets, and pass them  to the scrubs that can not live up to the Silver and Black. You want to play for the Raiders or get paid to play football. News flash..... Davis named the next NFL commissioner . And let them "players" park out with the real fans and see them run to their rides after a loss, away from us angry FANS!!!! |`|9d69b764809e9da2bea5615bfcd2110caa	5 coaches in 6 years.<br>  Davis gets way too involved. He hired a coach and wouldn't let him hire his own staff. He won't let him make adjustments to the duties or responsibilities of the staff, and Davis makes the personell decisions. He fired Shanahan and Gruden who have gone on to win Superbowls.<br>  I don't believe most of waht Davis said. He put that stuff out there to set the stage so he doesn't have to pay Kiffin whats left on his contract and to save face in the media.<br>  Noone wants to play for the Raiders and noone wants to coach the Raiders.<br>  On a side note, I like the promotion of Cable. He seems like a guy who understands the situation and is a Davis guy, so will probably be given more latitude in decisionmaking.|`|dDhTMacAaa	Al!Al!Al!<br>  <br>  I agree, I think the only reason he didn't fire him 3 weeks ago was to gather all the evidence he needed.<br>  <br>  In the words of Wilmer Valderrama, Lane Kiffin was "whipped like the family pig."<br>  <br>  (Valderamma = Fez, 70's show by the way)|`|b32e2cd13776356325013f9dc94f58d8aa	i personally think al made a good decision, but that's a good question "obama 08"
HxET88bDaa	I will say Schmeichel although VDS has achieved a lot in his career and deserves just as much respect.<br>  <br>  Schmeichel commanded the penalty area like it was a battlefield, if a defender made a mistake he would shout the house down and they wouldn't dare do it again. VDS on the other hand has a quiet confidence when it comes to his relationship with the defenders, he does it through respect rather than shouting at them. He is also a very intelligent thinker.<br>  <br>  When it comes to saving us at important points, they have it in equal measure, with Schmeichel probably being remember for more important games in our history. Although VDS will always be remember for the saves he has made in the CL etc.<br>  <br>  Kicking-wise, i'd say VDS is better, Schmeichel was prone to a few kicking gaffes, whereas VDS rarely has them even under pressure. <br>  <br>  So, overall, even though they have both been equally important to our recent history, it is Schmeichel who was the better keeper in my opinion.|`|H7AcXAyaaa	Peter Schmeichel is way better then Edwin.|`|cjNtjOZtaa	Peter Schmeichel - annoying voice though.|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Scmeichel, he was a GK and extra defender rolled in to one.|`|QuGTZJIVaa	Schmeichel without question.  The confidence he gave to his back four was tremendous, probably the best keeper we've had at CITY in the past 10 years and we only had him one year at the end of his career.<br>  <br>  You only have to look at United's successes to see how good he was when in his prime.|`|AA12362958	Although I'm a die-hard fans of the opposite side, Liverpool, of course!<br>  <br>  I have to admit, Peter is still the better one between the two! He's almost a legend in EPL. Sometimes I do wish he would be playing for Liverpool rather than Man Utd at those time!<br>  <br>  Peter was the Best!|`|gpNIG15eaa	In his prime,Peter Schmeichel is better than van der Sar.Even if van der Sar is the best keeper in the world,Schmeichel is a special kind of class.And no one can be better than him.|`|IWM1khX7aa	Schmeicel, Van Der Sar has only been really good now, he wasn't that good before.  <br>  <br>  Schmeichel is the best goalkeeper ever to play in the Premier League.|`|Xga0Y3Lhaa	Smeichal def! The only reason Edwin Van der sar got that record is because of his excellent defense.<br>  <br>  Both still really good goalkeepers but I would choose Smeichal|`|zovrJ0yXaa	schmeichel by a long way. vds is quality but schmeichel is a legend. better all round keeping too|`|Dyx2y7lVaa	van der sar-overrated<br>  <br>  schmiechel-legend|`|KQzB2O3uaa	schemeichel obviously|`|9c9a473d5a6cb2d9eca28584f55aa068aa	Peter Schmeichel is WAY WAY WAY better than van Der Sar.|`|Lr75hENEaa	van der sar is better|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	Peter Schmeichel by a long shot i think

Good night  Canada...<br>  <br>  <br>  Is it just me or does anyone else think Kornholser would leave his wife for Favre?|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Jaworski is my fav of the three but I cant stand Kornheiser.  Im so tired of hearing about his fantasy team.   He must have 45 people on one fantasy team.  It will NEVER be as good as Michaels, Gifford and Dierdorph. That was the best team ever|`|XTiMhga5aa	They are the worst announcers of all time, and weve been saying that for years yet they keep the same people|`|xDaesbudaa	Look, gone are the days of Michaels, Cosell, Gifford.  Deal with these dudes, or would you rather have Dierdork??|`|qkZvTTFxaa	they are not that bad but Kornheiser needs to cut the comb over for christ sake|`|b32e2cd13776356325013f9dc94f58d8aa	kornheiser's the best. overall i think they talk a little too much|`|wUooHVU3aa	Watched Ravens/Steelers with the sound off. Catch highlights, game summary and details on yahoo the day after the game.<br>  <br>  The last MNF game I watched, the diarrhea pluming from Kornheiser's mouth was so ridiculous, I vowed never to listen to the telecast again. He reminds of the the guy in the room trying to sound intelligent....by talking louder than anyone else.<br>  <br>  When I started watching MNF it was Pat Sumerall and John Madden. Madden was tough to take, at times, but Sumerall balanced him out.<br>  <br>  The Sunday night game has actually become a better, more watchable game, than MNF. ESPN has really slipped in their production of quality game coverage.|`|6529a7711efa2c97423a4ada9415c695aa	People mention that Korny is from PTI, and just because he is on that show, doesn't mean that he needs to turn the lord's game into PTI as well. They frequently have interviews that last for ridiculous amounts of time and go for several minutes without so much as hinting at what's happening with the game.<br>  <br>  The other issue I have is when they finally do talk about the game, the way they bad mouth certain teams. <br>  When Oakland played, sure they were terrible (and still are), but you can't rip on a team the entire game. Whattabout Minnesota Last night? They were complaining about how poorly MIN was playing and how they didn't win the game, but rather NO lost the game. The way i watched it, MIN won that game, bottom line. I can see that i'm not even a Vikings fan.<br>  Pathetic.<br>  <br>  |`|Um59i2H1aa	kornheiser detracts from the show. he doesn't know the game of football (just superficially, like most "talking heads"), and just talks stories or controversies. tries to create more. (and you can always tell the people who just take his opinions as their own, and regurgitate it. just because he's loud doesn't mean he's right. sure, he's probably right some of the time (not that any of us are the official judges of what is right), but it's probably on accident).<br>  <br>  tirico just sets them up. could be interchanged w/ most, but is ok in my book. his job isn't the hardest to do. at least he doesn't act like, or claim, to know much about football. he stays in his lane. he introduces the other guy, fills in the silent gaps, and reports on what happened on the field.<br>  <br>  jaws exaggerated pronunciated words sometimes get on my nerves. but he is knowledgeable and does his research.<br>  <br>  there are better, but the bottom two get the job done.<br>  <br>  just mute them. you are allowing them to have WAY more of a negative effect on you than they need to.|`|fe43dZY2aa	Monday night football died back in the early 90's.  First mistake was to do away with the old style intro.  Since then they have tried to resurrect the show.  Now it is lets hire morons to just talk through the whole game.  Maybe they should go back to what worked, announcers, renouncing the game. RIP|`|5UA8rm6taa	I think they WOULD be good announcers if they stayed on the subject and talked about the game......They ALWAYS get side-tracked and talk about something that has nothing to do with football, MEANWHILE, there is a big play going on down on the field!!!|`|KSdoeMHyaa	I agree. That Steelers game pissed me off...Tony Kornheiser (sp?) is probably the most annoying person to listen to. He's almost the equivalent of Jeff Van Gundy. Actually, they're all annoying. Let's get Joe Montana back in there! :)|`|8VtfC9PBaa	all kornhiser does is talk about Favre. i counted one game to see how many times he said Favre without relating to a play it was 42 times. and he make everthing over dramatic  now ill admit he does a good job on PTI but get him off MNF and get someone else!!|`|b35851bebedeb0b1105bb418e1edea3caa	I like Mike.  I also enjoy JAWS,  I love Tony on PTI but not in the booth.  He looks out of place and uncomfortable.  3 in the booth is too much.|`|5bjy742vaa	I listen to the commentators because if its a bad/boring game, we just sit there and make fun of them lol|`|QLs3siUSaa	Gotta love Tony Kornheiser. Pardon the interruption! Hehe|`|g0QYMgUhaa	Tony Kornholer is a complete dork. He makes me not even want to watch MNF now.

3EOWx0Xoaa	It's great exercise once your are playing competitive singles matches.  It works your legs, core, arms, and shoulders.  It also improves hand to eye coordination, reaction time, cardiovascular condition, stamina, and strengthens bones.  As long as you balance with stretching and proper form, you will be able to enjoy playing tennis for a long time.  I know people in their 80's that are in fantastic shape because they are still playing tennis a few times a week.|`|2OTqAtfJaa	it doesn't look easy? haha. if your playing singles (1 person on each side of the court) you're running allll over the place trying to get the ball! same with doubles. you're running a lot, i used to do it and you get sooo tired, that means it's definetely doing something for you|`|95ce90761beec741787305df69178ab5aa	at first it is easy when you first start out but when you start getting better and play with better people it wears you out|`|zjzq6VS3aa	Tennis is a complete exercise..since we use both upper body(strokes) as well as lower body (while running ) ...It really develops ur shoulder muscles.|`|tf3Uebbuaa	yes it is. <br>  some people don't think it is but you run a lot in tennis, and you also can arm muscles|`|GNq2rmrNaa	yes it is very good exercise

QC2NozBkaa	DON'T DO IT!!!!  The muzzle blast and wadding in a blank shotgun shell can defiantly be lethal.  Leave the special effects to the professionals.|`|t6sDVUI4aa	Don't use a blank in the shot.<br>  My advice get yourself some flash paper and put it in the end of the barrel. run a wire down the barrel with a rocket igniter (like from estes rockets) on the the end run it out from the open ejection port and off screen. shoot from the shooters back looking down the barrel of the gun. Shoot in dark lighting and see how it looks you will see a bright flash on screen and you can fade that out to show the bloody mess. <br>  <br>  Later Fire off some blanks, hell even live shells and record the sound and edit that in over the flash you made with the flash paper. and there you are a boom a blinding muzzle flash and no blanks being fired at anyone. After you let off the flash paper clean the gun thoroughly. And you are good to go|`|ZsujbEjJaa	no but the pressure of the blank coming out the barrel can still be lethal.

Come playoff time they will be a dangerous opponent for anyone they face.|`|b32e2cd13776356325013f9dc94f58d8aa	the panthers changed tremendously. they beefed up on the line, everyone upped in weight, with the exception of jordan gross. they finally have a solid recieving core again, one that doesnt center on smith. they have an amazing running back tandem in deangelo williams (a scat back) and stewart (the power back). defensively they have depth at every position allowing for better rotations. they have great talent at linebackers so every one can play one position instead of constantly switching to another position when someone goes down. they also have a ridiculous kick off specialist in lloyd (out the back of the endzone 75% of the time) so kasay can concentrate on being the accurate field goal kicker he is without worrying about wearing his leg out. almost everyone is healthy and theyre not dead on the sideline. the panthers are playoff contenders this year. no doubt about it.<br>  and i hate the patriots too

796979sWaa	Sorry I can't tell you a player who is better than Brian O'Driscoll, because there simply isn't one.<br>  <br>  Definitely after the Ireland v England game anyways. England played fricken dirty man! And the ref seemed to be blind to half of it. He got 3 hard blows form English players which all needed to be put in the sin bin for in my opinion. You could tell dricco was clearly in pain holding his head in his hands but yet he kept battling through it and in the end score a well-deserved try for Ireland. Man of the match, without doubt! He's the best captain the 6 nations and a born leader.<br>  <br>  Also from an Irish perspective I think Rob Kearney, at only 22, is one of the best full-backs in rugby.<br>  <br>  Luke Fitzgerald, Tommy Bowe and Jamie Healslip are really shining in this 6 nations too.<br>  <br>  And the obvious Ronan O'Gara but he wasn't exactly having his best game against England, missing like 3 penalties and a conversion. But in general hes an excellent player.<br>  <br>  And although Peter Stringer has been on the bench recently, when he is brought on he does give his all, especially against the french side.<br>  <br>  From the international side I would say Chris Patterson for Scotland. Lee Byrne and Tom Shanklin for Wales.<br>  <br>  But above all brian o'driscoll is the player of the 6 nations and to top it all off he's a total hottie lol! :P|`|QYfvgFsXaa	Jamie Heaslip has had a great tournament so far and may get himself a spot on the lions tour if he carries on like this. Gethin Jenkins and Martyn Williams are very special players for Wales but the best player in the tournament in my opinion is Sergio Parrise. Italy are having a very poor tournament but he has been imense.|`|YNYpmhy6aa	It's gotta be O'Driscoll - he has everything and can play with flair and speed (France) or do the dirty work (England).<br>  <br>  <br>  The best Irish player I've ever seen since I started watching way back in '98. Easily. And that's not an easy accolade to claim given a certain Keith Wood was around then.<br>  <br>  <br>  I think he'll be seen as the best centre ever when he retires - Tim Horan  and Jerry Guscott can suck it!|`|BDsYZGTqaa	Lee Byrne definately :-) He's even out-performing Mr Shane Williams at the moment!! Come on Wales!!!|`|5963777c1326f25763b8e30c1e4286ffaa	Gethin Jenkins..not one for the girls and busy doing a lot of unseen work (highest tackle count) - but he has been simply awesome.|`|lYTOUUtEaa	Lee Byrne  best player in the world|`|mnn8hYbtaa	For me its the delicious Shane Williams.

He's heavily marked all the time and still regularly scores fantastic tries. And also his performance against England was fantastic. They played dirty and fouled him and he just got up everytime and then he won the match by scoring a try i don't think even Richie McCaw could of scored and he icked a DG which ogara certainly wouldn't of. He did what a captain shld do he stood up and lead by example! <br>  IRELAND 4 DA SLAM!!!!!!!!!!|`|pIVgbFoHaa	Brian O'Driscoll Is Always Amazing , And Shane Williams Hasnt Been At His Best .

See you all in Cardiff xxx|`|28cfd7623333a2f7ff6a72ff3b125f27aa	My favourite player (of this 6 nations but not only) is Brian O'Driscoll, he's THE symbol of the irish team.

Moreover, he knows how to motivate his team mates.|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	I would have to go with Lee Byrne, the Welsh full back, he has been on form as far as his rugby is concerned...........feck all to do with how he looks!!!!!!!|`|kMyZEEhNaa	Yes, he is even better than you think - You wait, there's more to come.

TWICE... home and away... against a team that has Aguero... a player that is 5 times better than all Arsenal's strikers together!!!!<br>   <br>  Puyol and Marquez stopped Henry at his life form and you doubt that they can stop Ade or Bendtner... LLMMAAOOOOOOO|`|xvuAQ0DAaa	Arsenal will get revenge for the last meeting in the final.  3-1 on aggregate|`|AA12370193	It will be a tough match, but probably comfortable match for Arsenal. It could honestly go either way as they both play attacking football, so it will be down to whoever takes their chances best.<br>  Player to player, Barca may have better matchups nearly all around the park. Tho I feel Clichy may be able to keep up with Messi he will be needing help from Gallas as Dan Alves will also be up there with him. Eto'o and Henry should be handled by the other defenders and whoever is our deep mid (hopefully Diaby is fit).<br>  Our forwards should not have as great a problem as Abidal is old and washed out, Pique is prone to mistakes, and Marquez and Puyol will be best at defending set pieces I think so we'll have to stay sharp if its them. Also by the quarters we should definitely have Fabregas, Walcott, Adebayor and Eduardo back so drop Bendtner Vela Ramsey from the starters.<br>  <br>  Mind games from the fans and coaches, don't think there will be much, they both no how similar they play so there cant be much to criticize/boast.|`|LReOvHEdaa	How is Barca in form now ?<br>  When was the last time Barca won a game?<br>  <br>  Football isnt compared man to man firstly.How did Numancia beat Barcelona then ?How did Hull beat Arsenal ?<br>  <br>  Football is played on that day and anything can happen.That's the beauty of this game..<br>  <br>  Barca's midfield is best in the world.

I really hope manutd are interested cause he is so gorgeous!!! Omg lol what if man take him? when i go to matches il be lik faintin n everythin i love him so much, Oh that platnum hair!! Oh!!! lol x

XVYRUzkEaa	Daniel Vettori is the best Spinner for New Zealand. But Warne and Murali are miles ahead him. <br>  Vettori's a very Economical bowler. But he hasn't taken much wickets as comapred to Warne or Murali. <br>  He doesn't have any variations unlike the 2 Legends.<br>  So overall, yes he is an under rated bowler.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	No, he isn't in their class. He bowls flatter, is very accurate, can't hit him out etc etc, but he won't get many wickets in this way. At best he can hold fort till the fast bowlers come. But, he's a good thinki9ng bowler and captain. And a gentleman to the core. Warne and Murali are miles ahead|`|60uWyEKtaa	The best ODI spinner in the world right now, but no comparison to the two greats, he does not have the variety, the flight and the 9 different balls that the two masters have.<br>  <br>  He is still under rated though.|`|0ac3af7f05344feefbb618ff09a3b896aa	Not really<br>  But anyway he is the best spinner for NewZealand|`|4bEejG3jaa	Newz's best SPINNER|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	yes|`|8T0Z0Y17aa	He is one of the best spinners at the moment (And is pretty handy with the bat too) and that has been recognised by a lot of people, so I wouldn't say he is underrated. Also, he was high up in the ratings the last time I looked.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with other answers, in that he isn't quite Warne or Murali class.|`|5aeda75cd1182494108e1cde6db83b33aa	Certainly, Vettori is a world class material but never he got the recognition to the extent from the cricketing world what he deserves. I respect your ability, leadership quality and coolness.|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Nah, not of same class but a certainly a good bowler!! He is economical and gets wickets and is also decent with bat! Overall, a very good all-rounder!|`|f46e40cfc0dd6c8bb80ff83f005fc521aa	Best slow bowler in ODIs and T20.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	yes i too think that Daniel Vettori,.....<br>  ................. is an under rated bowler~
p8ahZa8iaa	I personally like baseball best, but football and footy are right behind it.    <br>  <br>  Cricket?  I used to enjoy watching the 5 day test matches between England and the West Indies back in the day.    <br>  <br>  Basketball?   Haven't watched it since Jordan retired.|`|1uSoU8Lpaa	For me its baseball. I enjoy the game tremendously. Besides the play of at least 162 games/year (more if you figure in Spring Training and playoffs), it's unique. Every field is different. All players are different (ex: skinny, tall, short, fat, 20 years old, 41 years old). It's a casual game, fans are great. 9 innings or more until someone wins, equal innings, it's fair.<br>  <br>  I also like Football (American)<br>  But everyone has a preference, and has their own reasoning. But for me baseball is best.|`|5agXk9ldaa	well all sports are good <br>  but i think soccer is the most famous specially in the World soccer<br>  and also you have the NBA <br>  in our country the basketball is better we got 5 time the asia cup and hope we can win a world title|`|BCebZRu3aa	It's all about personal preferences. Baseball is my favorite, but the others are great too. I like the traditions associated with baseball as well as it's history. I also like keeping up with player's stats.|`|JHhViCuRaa	It's tough to say which sport is the best but in my opinion the most fun to play and watch is football. I'm not a big fan of soccer because, especially to watch, I find it really slow. That's just my opinion, cricket I don't even understand. Basketball is fun to play but honestly I think football is the best sport because of the hard hitting, and strategy that is involved. You have to be so athletic to play football I just think that the best of the best athletes (strongest and fastest) are playing football, atleast the American ones.|`|ySFQ2TDWaa	Good question. I think soccer is the best of these sports. The second is Baseball. Soccer is better than baseball since baseball can be a little boring sometimes, but soccer is most of the time exciting and fun. I dont watch that much Basketball, but I like it though.|`|XAINHpr7aa	baseball, and tennis|`|GwawzO5Faa	Baseball. You gotta love a game that changes pitch by pitch and all of scenarios that can happen on one pitch.|`|P1bO87l1aa	For me its baseball.  Its the sport I grew up with.  I could play baseball.  Not very good,  but I could play it. I didn't have the stamina or size to play soccer or football and was not into contact sports.  I know too little about cricket except its an English sport.  For me baseball is and always will be number 1.
60uWyEKtaa	About 1/15 the length of a game of test cricket....|`|swsICJ6Jaa	Baseball is approximately 3 hours.<br>  <br>  And it has existed for 150 years, so, it is not copying anything.<br>  It's more likely that cricket copies baseball.<br>  <br>  Start researching everything you can about baseball, and you'll find how exciting it is. <br>  <br>  It's played by Japan, USA, Canada, Central America, the Caribbean, Netherlands, Australia, and many other countries. Countries like India don't know what they are missing. They should give baseball a chance.|`|b70f09b31607c20364cbe8abc0328a82aa	From the first to last pitch about 3 hours. <br>  With 2 good pitchers 2/12 hours. <br>  With 2 secondary pitchers 3 1/2 hours.<br>  I "think" the longest 9 inning game ever was about 8 hours. <br>  The shortest 9 inning game was an amazing 51 minutes.<br>  Hope this helps.<br>  John|`|RLoilwCNaa	around 3 hours. sometimes less, sometimes more.|`|ZpH2PFF9aa	about 3 hours ex if a game stars at 7 it will most likley end at 10|`|u4kO7Fgfaa	As the great Yogi Berra said,"It ain't over til it's over."|`|XAINHpr7aa	3 hours|`|GwawzO5Faa	On average they last between 2.5 to 3+ plus hours.|`|P1bO87l1aa	There is no clock in baseball.  A nine inning game usually takes about 3 hours.  I have seen some in just under two hours while other may go longer than 3 hours.  If extra inning are needed there is no telling how long a game will take I have seen some games take 6-7 hours and go well in excess of 20 innings.   I heard somewhere that in international competition there is a limit to the number of innings.  I have no idea how they determine a winner then.  It makes no sense to stop a game until a winner has been determined.|`|NpqAbZqpaa	Baseball is one of the few team sports that have no time limits even in regulation time.  <br>  No clock, it takes as long as it takes.  Anywhere from 90 minutes to 8 hours.|`|8LzF0ye8aa	However long it takes.  Usually nine innings or in some cases because of bad weather the game can become official after 5 1/2 innings. An average game usually takes between 2 1/2 and 3 hours.|`|b30195e932765839f31a572f8d05c0f8aa	Games range from two to four hours and baseball is unlike any other sport.|`|AA11720887	The correct answer to your question as you asked it is until there is a winner.

Pc0QjrQ4aa	The unofficial answer?  The Leafs took on salary from Tampa for a draft pick (essentially helping a financially strapped Tampa team).  They bought a draft pick.<br>  <br>  The official answer?  Kolzig, Heward, and Rogers will get an opportunity to compete for jobs, and the 4th round draft pick helps.  The Leafs sent out a prospect, so in essence, it's a 4th round pick for a prospect, with a few extras thrown in.<br>  <br>  Moore is a 3rd/4th line guy that wants 2nd line money.  In a salary cap system...no chance.  A second round draft pick is reasonable.<br>  <br>  Antropov...3rd/4th line guy (at best).  2nd round pick from the circus?  Sign me up.  That could be a high 2nd when things end up shaking out.<br>  <br>  Kolzing and Heward will not play a game for the Leafs and, barring a miracle, never will.  If they see the inside of the dressing room...that'd be a shock.<br>  <br>  Tampa is financially strapped, so the Leafs took on salary of two guys (one of who is likely to retire, the other is very much a question mark) to get a mid-level pick.|`|a9f693c71e4b465afcc9a6b377b02694aa	Brian Burke was feeling generous, and has decided to pay the salaries of two injured Tampa players.  Neither Kolzig or Heward will become a Leaf (notwithstanding the fact that Heward was a Leaf 12 or so years ago)<br>  <br>  What Burke did was help out Tampa financially because Toronto had the cap space to do so.  In exchange for the money, Toronto gets a 4th round pick.  Since the NHL would not have approved of that particular deal, the two minor leaguers were thrown in to help.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Look at it this way<br>  This would be the same as you living in a big house, but you are unable to pay your bills.  In exchange for your neighbour paying your car loan (Kolzig) and mortgage (Heward), you give him a chocolate chip cookie (the 4th round pick).  Since his bank wouldn't like that deal....you exchange your barbecues (the minor leaguers) just to make it look better.<br>  <br>  Your neighbour does not want your car, or your house (and the Leafs don't want Kolzig or Heward) but he has the income to help you out (and the Leafs have the cap space to help out the Lightning).  The switch of barbecues is really inconsequential....as was the exchange of minor leaguers.|`|shVgCizBaa	Toronto wants to help the Lightnings financially by reducing the total salary of the  financially strapped Tampa team.In return they got(bought) a draft  pick .Leafs sent Richard Petiot 26 years old and in return got Andy Rogers 22 years old and a fourth-round pick .Toronto received also Jamie Heward 37years old and Jamie Heward 38 years old.Tampa Bay will save money.Toronto will pay their salary.Kolsig is out for remainder of season.Toronto goalie   Vesa Toskala  is out for the season.|`|jwPf5rsiaa	****** DA #1....can you READ??<br>                #2....IF you can read....do you not understand what has been explained to you in this question?<br>                #3  Do you not know how to search through other questions for an explanation.....wait that would assume you can read and comprehend what is being said.|`|oJsrGmmPaa	The money thing has already said to death, but I think it's a good deal. Essentially, one AHL d-man for another AHL d-man plus a draft pick. Kolzig and Heward are fillers and wouldn't even ding the Leafs in any way or form.|`|muOxoDGOaa	I am just pissed off that they traded off Moore and Antropov...wtf???|`|uDv0cgvzaa	As a Leaf hater, I still agree they(the leafs) won the Antropov deal. They have no one that can play, and now with Moore and Antropov gone, I believe they will have to rely on Blake scoring every third game from now on. Olie and Darth Gerber better be ready for a rough ride(not that Gerber was doing much better in Ottawa)<br>  As for the question, I feel the same. I don't understand that trade.

I mean look at what we have lost to retirement & injury in the past 12 months?I just hope we soon get the injured Lee, Clark & others back very soon, as it takes a while to get those youngsters motivated or up to scratch.Good Q, a star.|`|5GUjFJjkaa	I doubt that very much. Australia is concentrating on winning (I hope) the current series in SA which will see them maintain their number one status. India and Indian fans (you guys) seem obsessed with putting Australia down and in so doing elevating Indias status. <br>  Stop trying to big note your country by claiming that India invented "blooding young players', this has been done by all nations for many years, the trick is to do it (blood young players) at the correct time.|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	Every team is watching other's performance closely so that they could strategise when they meet .

I doubt there's another Hussey waiting in the wings.|`|1uLfl0sXaa	If at all it is happening there is no harm; we took many positive things from the Aussies and built up this team. The Men in Blue have come a long way since 2003 when this label was given to them, and directly or indirectly we owe a lot to Aussies: in a way it's they who inspired us to do better: the ultimate challenge was to conquer them, and that's the motivation that kept us going.|`|yA9jOximaa	I don't think they are following India's principle. It's just that they have to replace some great players who have retired(McGrath,Shane,Damien,Hayden) and they are looking for fresh legs.But it would also be unfair to say that they are not bothered about India's prowess who have, I must say become the best ODI side in the world.Well hats off to them.Having younger players will definitely help Australia and it will be interesting to see India vs 'teh New Australia' (if they defeat SA) <br>  P.S. I hope i was serious enough (:|`|7Vg2nrP1aa	we cannot say like this because australia is one of the best team of the world though they were going through bad times in between but they will come back strongly as they have players like warner,lee,m.clarke,watson,bracken.........|`|12e115ffb0286b3d75f099f1886c903aaa	They are putting in younger players as they are is a rebuilding phase.

YYqrT4jBaa	First off, don't buy off of ShortyUsa. They rip you off on shipping. <br>  <br>  The AEG M16 will probably be crap so don't waste your money on it. The red dot sight and flashlight are worthless as well.<br>  <br>  If I were you I'd get a tactical airsoft shotgun. My friend has one and in casual play you can use it as a sniper and a primary weapon. Most airsoft shotguns have the ability to slam fire (holding the trigger and pumping) which increases the shots per second but can damage the gun. <br>  <br>  I linked a site for the best tactical airsoft shotgun for the price. It's the same one my friend has. It has a hi-cap mag included and can use the 20rd Cybergun/SoftAirUsa magazines. Make sure you use .20gram BBs because they work the best and hurt pretty bad.

Worm your way up the pole until you reach the top. There are many methods but try to find one that is suitable for your core strength.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|918cMmVnaa	i know what you mean...  i have absolutely no arm strength either. i recommend using your ankles/calves to wrap around the pole (hope this doesnt sound too wrong) and push yourself up enough to move your hands up.<br>  its a shame your not allowed to take your shoes off because that will make it slippery..<br>  hope this helps!|`|Upk0n5Z0aa	use pressure from your thighs to help hold you.|`|KNBjKFoVaa	u just climb it....??

Next you need to figure out what type of power or strength you are lacking. The three basic types of strength are: Base strength, transitional power, and explosiveness or "Reactive" power, they are all different and must be trained in different ways. Now I know a lot of you are wondering what's the difference between the three. Well in short Base Strength is how much weight you can move, Transitional Power is how fast you can move said weight and explosiveness is the maximum speed and distance you can move said weight with each single movement. A good Vertical Jump training routine will include the following exercises:<br>  <br>  Base Strength <br>  1: Traditional Squats and Pistol Squats <br>  2: Deadlifts/base building olympic lifts <br>  3: Lunges <br>  4: Core Work (Functional Performance Core Strength= The ability to make your pelvis and spine "lock" and work as a single stable unit, not simply having a 6 pack or being able to do 100 crunches) <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Transitional Power: <br>  1: Box Squats/Tempo Squats <br>  2: Power Cleans <br>  3: Push Press <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  Explosiveness: <br>  1: Ballistic and jump squats <br>  2: Traditional and Compound/Hybrid Plyometrics <br>  3: Sprinting <br>  4: Core Work <br>  5: Stretching<br>  <br>  You'll also want to figure out which individual muscles/muscle groups are working inefficiently. You can figure this out by completing a full vertical jump test progression and a baseline fitness test to diagnose any muscle imbalances that you may have. Remember no matter what type of training program you do you must make sure that opposing muscles are strengthened and balanced (e.g. Quads and hamstrings, abs and lower back) so don't skip the quad extensions and hamstring curls. If opposing muscles are not strengthened they will lead to weak links, energy leaks and imbalances will result in poor poor or slow improvement and raise the risk of injury significantly. Do a routine that combines plyomertic/bodyweight, free weight and or acceleration routines. Make sure you are consuming lots of protein to aid in muscle repair after tough workouts You'll also want to replenish your bodies ATP and glycogen stores as they are the fuel for those type IIa and type IIb muscle fibers you will be (AKA FG and FOG) shredding during your workout. In order to gain inches you'll need to tax your central nervous system and force your body to create new motor pathways. If you train correctly you should gain at least an inch a week. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTyRA" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7PxcPllTy...</a><br>  <br>  Jump 20 inches higher in 10 weeks:<br>  <a href="http://www.program51.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.program51.com</a>
g7w4UGCgaa	There are several names on that list that are attractive options to me. I'm particularly fond of Curtis Granderson. A speedster that will hit for average and get you plenty of runs and steals. But I'm partial to anyone that can bring in steals. Just my opinion.

PY72YH9Saa	I would try Ellsbury and Percival for Webb and Justin Upton. A lot of baseball experts think he will have a better year.|`|AA49cfdraa	It's not a bad trade.  You don't NEED his steals if you have Sizemore, Crawford and Taveras.  Ianetta isn't bad, maybe hold onto him.  See if you can just do Ellsbury for Webb.|`|AA11073512	That depends on if you need Ellsbury's steals. If you have a steals guy at 2b, ss, or 3b, I would take that trade. If you need steals, you might want to try and work Ordonez into that trade over Ellsbury. Maybe Ordonez and Percival for Webb.<br>  Upton's BA might hurt you, Ramon isn't much of an upgrade over Iannetta, and Johnny might not be able to bring up his ERA.|`|8pMMooOyaa	YES YOU ACCEPT!!!!!

c8f8a15fe9b889540c8c3fcffe64b7d9aa	I agree that there is no reason you cannot start with Zen.  Though I don't follow Zen meditation myself, I have implemented several techniques into my meditation.<br>  <br>  Keep in mind that there are many ways to meditate, and none of them are wrong. Here are some different things you can try.  <br>  <br>  Get into a relaxed position.  You don't necessarily need to be in a full lotus to have ideal positioning for meditation.  Sitting, kneeling, walking are all perfectly acceptable.  The whole point is to not be too focused on the body, but rather on the harmony of the mind.  <br>  <br>  1.  The wall - sit in front of a blank wall, and just stare at one point of it.  Focus on your breathing by counting your breaths in groups of ten.<br>  <br>  2.  Visualization is a very powerful mind tool to achieve your desires.  For example, before I train, I think of nothing but my training, and empty my mind of the bills I need to pay, the groceries I need to pick up, and the coworker who drives me crazy.<br>  <br>  3.  Empty your mind of all thought, and allow your mind to be the mirror of the world around you.  For example, if you have a place where you can be calm (ie: a park), sit and allow yourself to truly hear every sound and see every sight, without thinking.  Don't think, just be.<br>  <br>  I'm not guru of meditation, just a guy who has found that with these various techniques, I can allow myself to shrug off any disharmony around me.|`|v1mbL56caa	I try to avoid recommending Zen meditation; however I am a strong advocate of directed meditation. I think you will find it easier and beneficial If you are involved in Martial Arts one form of meditation that is a natural is moving meditation. Try doing one of your kata or pomise Slowly and relaxed while focusing on deep breathing. Focus on the feel of your body and the muscles you use through the movements of the form. Yes this is just like Tai Chi Quigong. Another form of directed meditation is to sit quietly in a comfortable position. Close your eyes and chose a pleasant thought or object, scene, or precept. Keep the mind on this as the mind will try to wander off topic, keep bringing it back. While doing this practice deep breathing. Breathing deeply by extending your lower abdomen is key to meditation as it brings maximum oxygen to the body and especially the brain. These are simple forms of meditation and are very powerful for a beginner. <br>  <br>  I always start the day with a breathing exercise and meditation while sitting on the edge of my bed in the morning. It will give you a jump start on the day and you may find that 2 to 3 min. of breathing and meditation is more refreshing than a cup of coffee. <br>  Meditation is very important. If you are religious you can use prayer as a form of meditation. If you are Christian the Bible admonishes us to meditate on all things beautiful and Holy. If you are Not particularly religous meditation is an important tool for recentering your mind on your life, goals and what is important to you. Clearing out the trash thoughts that cloud the mind.|`|8395f464f951baf847594ae5b8585b9aaa	forget Zen until you have more experience in mediation. First start by breathing deeply and as you do let the belly expand. Hold it for a second or two and slowly exhale and let the belly collapse as the air is leaving. Just focus on that for 15 minutes a day to start|`|apr9gsgjaa	research taoist nui kung (Chi gong, qi gong etc) Its really good stuff but you cant just learn the exercises you need a teacher to correct you and explain to you what your doing.|`|czXaUPIlaa	Zen meditation is perfectly appropriate for new meditators. In fact, almost everyone who begins Zen practice is new to meditation.<br>  <br>  And Zen meditation is very easy to learn. This short video will tell you everything about it - it's very clear and enjoyable to watch:<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs58&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=csyCrcpDs...</a><br>  <br>  When you begin meditating, here are some things to know:<br>  - Be consistent. Practice every day, at the same time each day, and for the same period of time.<br>  - It's easier with others. If there's a Zen center nearby, you'll find them to be a great support.<br>  - Don't have any expectations for having some wonderful experience from meditation. Just do it, and your life will slowly transform.<br>  <br>  Best wishes on your path!

aLcGuGVNaa	Since this is in the Football section, I'm assuming you're talking about the effect it would have on your career?  Well, the only case I know of is Chris Simms.  He ruptured his spleen in, I believe, the third week of the season a few years back and it put him down for the rest of the season.  He was back the next year, but as a quarterback, his whole balance was off and everything.  He wasn't able to regain the starting job, but that doesn't mean much when you're talking about how the Bucs treated their quarterbacks.|`|RrKeyYo0aa	if not treated properly, you can die from it. as far as being a career ender... well, just ask chris simms. the former buc QB ruptured his spleen and hasn't been right since. although he hasn't retired, his career is pretty much over.|`|htBHCNDtaa	Extremely serious, as far as I know it helps produce cells involved in immune responses, therefore if it's ruptured it may not be able to do so anymore.|`|ULw1777caa	Very serious but you can come back from it.

McDaniels was with newengland last year right, and they did pick up the trubled Randy Moss Didn't they? There for who says denvor doesn't pick up Terrell Owens and try him out atleast.. he could be a great addition to Brandon Marshall and Eddy Royal... Kind of reminds me of a trio that was in New England... Gaffney,Moss, and Welker? how about Marshall, Owens and Royal?|`|mTSOJKlyaa	"And perhaps also count out Kansas City because new coach Todd Haley and Owens hardly got along when Haley was Dallas' offensive coordinator."|`|oAWEcd5Qaa	Since he is team poison.No team in their right mind will pick him up.In all reality he will probably end up in prison somewhere in a year or less.|`|ME62Mtv4aa	I'm thinking Redskins??|`|FfYEmXaEaa	I think the Chiefs would be stupid to take a guy like TO after trying to rebuild... he needs to be somewhere where he can contend for a championship. Unfortunately he is going to have to either accept a role as a second reciever or go play in Canada. I would say Indianapolis, KC, DC, and Arizona all look promising, but I pity whoever does end up taking him.|`|AA10372804	Probably the Raiders, they just freed up a bunch of cap room and they have a history of getting star receivers and making them absolutely worthless on the field (Randy Moss, Javon Walker)|`|HlXrHd52aa	I'm hoping that teams will finally learn that he's really not worth the trouble!  It's a shame to have all that talent and a piss-poor personality.|`|ynyfN7bBaa	Chiefs are a possibilty but I think he will end with the Jaguars.|`|eoNlLXLSaa	I could see him in Oakland now.

I can guarantee you that the Cowboys will not be as good without him.<br>  <br>  Cleveland wouldn't be a good fit.  TO wants to go to a contender and no offense, but Cleveland isn't that team.  As soon as TO hinted that Quinn should get him the ball more (even if it is true), the Browns fans would be after him and all would be lost.<br>  <br>  I'd like to ask my GM, who's throwing money at overrated, underachieving CBs (DeAngelo Hall) to throw some money at this guy as soon as he is officially on the market.  Then we go to Dallas and he can dance on the star again.  As well as make McNabb's life hell some more in the same conference.|`|13096d1166a977e58810a6cdcc148f36aa	well, one could virtually guarantee they would "give him the ball" on every passing play, so he'd probably like that.  quinn seems pretty 'manly', so i doubt TO would call him gay.  if quinn starts puking in the huddle, TO might have a problem with that, though.  i can only imagine it would take TO about one hour to find something wrong in cleveland to b*tch about...."i don't like the orange helmet", "i want it changed from the 'dawg pound' to the 'TO hotel'", "why are there all these butterfingers in my locker?", "what's with the wet naps?", blah blah blah.<br>  <br>  but honestly i don't think TO could handle getting smacked around by the steelers D twice a year.  he's a whiny little b*tch|`|3971fad8bfeb5090ffc3629ffe9dbd80aa	I'm hoping we do not get stuck with T.O. His attitude alone is not for the Browns. I was kinda surprised when they traded Kellin Winslow but I do see their reasoning. There's still time to get a wide receiver out of the draft and tie up some of the loose ends on the team. There are a lot of non Browns fans on here, but as football fans they should realize that The Browns are in a rebuilding phase right now. If the Browns come up with the right players they very possibly could surprise a lot of people. I'd like to see that.|`|HtYGxZcCaa	I think so, Quinn is the best QB in the NFL and with a WR like Owens Cleveland's offense may be the best in the NFL.

nwwhfuADaa	yes.of course i would be content with just that regarding the EPL.<br>  first off,the champions league is a very important competition and we are on the verge of not being able to make it there next season so its very important for us to manage a top 4 position even though its without a doubt that we arent challenging for the title<br>  secondly, nobody blames Arsenal for being in the position they currently are.the squad has suffered a lot of absences and throughout the season at least 3 or 4 of our key players were injured .weve never had a full squad . you see Walcott,Fabregas ,Eduardo and Rosiscy have all been injury-prone and out for several months and who contribute largely to the team's performance along with some other minor injuries.this imposed a huge burden on the squad's ability.i admit our performance has been crap at times and we have screwed up on occasions but hopefully we will bounce back now <br>  <br>  winning the FA cup is a possibility.im not giving up on that just yet<br>  <br>  Is it true that Arsenal never won the CL? Yeah its true but i am not surprised youve mentioned it since you are a Barcelona supporter even though you clearly know the answer to that|`|ceef93d1024d0e6a2e214650ffb17d50aa	Seems like it, they have really low expectations and a really low transfer kitty.

You asked this same thing and i think i got you pretty good. You claim we have never won the CL yet Barca has only won it twice.... one of them was against a 10 men Arsenal. Even the stupidest Barca fan like you would admitt we put up a good fight with 10 men most of the game. And honestly your just stupid!!! I have respect for Barca fans cause at least some speak sense. You speak nonesense. As i told you before, i am a Barca admirer but damn you make your team look bad. Thank god your Mexican!!! Cause if you were of European nationality i think i would give a damn. So go back and admire Marquez or go do some more glory hunting haha.|`|iQvkT8Doaa	At least we don't keep talking crap like you week in week out<br>  <br>  Yes we're happy considering how much injuries & sh*t have gone in our way.|`|Hiasgb75aa	Yep, its true

f1Hhl3Beaa	What you must remember is that because both teams use virtually the same cars, Red Bull Technologies (the company that designs the cars) have to produce four cars compared to other teams who only need to make two complete cars. It is rather worrying that they have only ran with simulated downforce and slicks, with a driver in Buemi who's F1 experience and therefore comparison and feedback is minute.<br>  <br>  It does look as though they've inherited a great car from Red Bull, but they still need testing time to suss it out for themselves. They will be at the last test in Barcelona, and that really puts them on the same level as 'Brawn Racing', who should be there next week too. That's quite strange to think considering the entire 'Honda' saga... if Honda hadn't withdrawn, they would've been at all the same tests as the others with their 2009 car, leaving STR far behind in terms of testing.<br>  <br>  It's certainly worrying, but there must be some method behind their madness!|`|KTxxd700aa	Torro Rosso let Red Bull do most of the testing for them.<br>  remember they didn't have their new car last year till Monaco, though of course the new rules stipulate the new car for Australia.<br>  Ha, just remembered the beginning of the 2005 season, Minardi had to take untested parts off their test 2005 car and fit them to their 2004 chassis the week before the Australian GP! their craziness is sorely missed|`|FPJSoxYwaa	THey will be launching it on monday, it will be the same as the RedBull car only with differnt engines.|`|8Uy59oqIaa	well the teams are quite similar anyways. so if the testing is done i thought it would be given to them and compare. since they are virtually the same.
S7rc6mp7aa	Yao is needed to clog up the paint. Even if he was not playing last year, he was still missed and the team could not play like that in the playoffs of last year. <br>  <br>  The thing about TMac, I believe they play better without him for now because they don't have to wonder "when is tmac going to be injured again" Because everyone knows he is injury prone. Now they are able to just focus on the team now without adjustments entering the playoffs knowing that he will not be back this season. <br>  <br>  Next year, they should try to trade T-mac for another good player while they still can. Keep Artest, he is good offensively and defensively most of the time.  And build around that.|`|GswnLKtQaa	I think with Yao they are better, with T-Mac no because he's always in and out of the line-up because of injuries.|`|xQgciq09aa	Artest is much better on defense than T-Mac and he doesn't suck on offense either, so with so many other guys improving their game, with Artest in the starting lineup, maybe he isn't the right guy for this team.|`|3dpdQssvaa	hell no.  The Rockets weakness even up to last year with mcgrady in playoffs is that they could not put up points.  Artest and Battier are only good for 15-18 points a game with a sub 45% field goal percentage and sub 35% three point percentage.|`|vzH7f7V5aa	No.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	Yep|`|0ytjj1EGaa	when 1 of the mis injured it doesnt affect them that much<br>  <br>  but the 2 together will cause problems|`|4DcvpQXfaa	Not really|`|VENyKvgaaa	nope just as bad as the charlote bobcats if they didnt have yao and      t-mac
EP6xEIVLaa	The Pakistan goverment is HEPLING terrorists. Seriously people, its pretty obvious. The taliban has been getting weapons from them, and it has been found that they are attempting to find weak spots on the Indian border for terrorist crossings. And whats pissing me off the most is this:<br>  <br>  The shooting in Mumbai were investigated not only by Indian Intelligence Agencies, but also the CIA. The attack was tracked back to the ISA. <br>  <br>  THE CIA EVEN CONFIRMED PAKISTANI GOVERMENTS INVOLVMENT|`|aN4SUKkRaa	This is the harsh reality of terrorism in the 21st century.<br>  <br>  One of the principal aims of terorism is to disrupt the country or regime in which the act is perpetrated.<br>  <br>  Examples:<br>  <br>  The attack on the World Trade Centre disrupted one of the United States most efficient means of long distant passenger transport. The amount of security at airports viz-a-viz screening has added considerably to travel times.<br>  <br>  The World Trade Centre attack also was a stab at the heart of international commerce and capitalism.<br>  <br>  The Bali bombings were aimed specifically at tourists. Bali's economy relies heavily on the tourist dollar.<br>  <br>  The Madrid train attack occurred just before a general election in Spain where one side's election promise was to withdraw troops from Iraq. They won in a landslide.<br>  <br>  The London train and bus attacks made popular opinion in the UK to rise in support of the withdrawal of British troops.<br>  <br>  The Beslan school massacre in southern Russia, perpetrated by persons unknown, was generally blamed on Chechan separatists. Even during the time of Stalin, children were offlimits to the worst of the regime's excesses. Suspicion has been pointed towards Russian nationalist movements in the area who do not wish for Chechnya to secede being responsible, laying the blame elsewhere and having popular opinion go against the separatists. Russia's attitude to hostage situations is clear: the safety of the hostages is not a consideration when dealing with terrorists. <br>  <br>  Cricket in Pakistan is a de-facto state religion. Attacking cricketers was another way of attacking the state. If a group simply wanted to disrupt the Test match because the home team were losing, they could have simply damaged the pitch during the night which happened in England in 1975. The attack DID NOT occur because the Sri Lankan team were beating the home side and a group of people were sore losers!!|`|VeFsowjDaa	LOL... well i dont think its their performance... but there is one question... because PCB said tht they would give presidential security to our players... but did they deliver on that ?? that is a big question... if they call that presidential security... well i think their president should be dead by now... luckily non of the playrs were seriously injured.... btw, im a sri lankan.|`|561a42dcf730fd97fc3a2ebd788ea961aa	their personal gain~or may be as you said,... they unable to digest SL team performance...whatever...<br>  an attack on innocent cricketers can be categorized as the most shameless & terrifying,...of all attacks !!!!<br>  its so disturbing for cricket lovers...very sad they had to target sportsmen..for their private vendetta<br>  this Development on cricketers ,is so unprecedented....in cricket world,...<br>  we really appreciate for the concern on our cricketers speedy recovery...<br>  thanks again for everyone who cares about SL cricketers<br>  my whole point of View was changed on some users....<br>  i realize there are very good people amongst ~|`|uKLlkOPSaa	Day by Day Terrorism is Increasing in its madness|`|b7f6b1292b666a974a7a9c247d278b21aa	Since long terrorism has grown into a well organised and well oiled industry in Pakistan.  It has the backing of Military/ISI and behind scene blessing of the US administration.<br>  So far the terrorists were targeting India and the US.<br>  Now they have started targeting their own guests.  Islam prohibits harming guests and am sure these terrorists and their handlers will answer Allah.<br>  It is not because they were unable to digest SL's performance that they attacked.  There is a tussle going on between the impotent civilian government and the Military/ISI combine at the other.  Military/ISI ccombine wanted to embarrass the government and had the attacks carried out..|`|7d41bc8d8005e8cdc7e2dd4b1921581caa	R u in senses? in the last test match sri lanka made more than that, but Pakistan got a lead, and captain made more than 300, so think before writing anything.<br>  <br>  Sri Lankan cricket team targetted in Pakistan? who can be beneficial?<br>  Following this: Gunmen attack Sri Lankan cricket team in Lahore<br>  <a href="http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn%20Content%20Library/dawn/news/pakistan/punjab/sri-lankan-cricket-team-convoy-attacked-eight-players-injured-ha" rel="nofollow">http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/Dawn...</a><br>  Terrorist want to Isolate Pakistan, as India said that they will make Pakistan isolated.

It seems that Indian,RAW backed Tamil tigers are behind this as Tamil tigers lost war to Sri Lankan forces who are equipped by Pakistan.<br>  It look like the same kind of attack as it was in Mumbai, I think Indian intelligence agency RAW is behind it, as they wanted to isolate Pakistan & also they wanted to take revenge of Mumbai terror attack by terrorizing the Pakistani and visitors to Pakistan.<br>  I don’t support 2011 world cup in South Asia, as all 4 countries having problems.|`|AA12155794	Terrorists and terrorism are given a free hand in Pakistan in connivance<br>  with fundamentalists Army.There Govt.is nonexistence and powerless.<br>  Nobody care the so called Govt.Terrorists do whatever they want to do.<br>  Showing the world they are supreme and nobody else.It is not SL performance,they don't bother.It is their activity that matters.|`|AA10327413	Its not the performance.

Whether it is with Nick Fry or not, he has his dream of being a designer/engineer/owner of an F1 team with some amazing facilities and a top driver in Jenson Button.<br>  <br>  It's not to say no-one else wanted it, because lots of people have come out and said they were interested, but such is the financial state of the world at the moment that they couldn't get a budget together to takeover the team.<br>  <br>  Mercedes have been very good in all this too, as you'd think it would've been Ferrari to help their old hero Brawn out, especially as they have the propensity to seeing as Force India have gone to Merc... Now its Mercedes who power three teams rather than Ferrari.<br>  <br>  I think with the right backers, this can be run like any other independant team, like Williams or Force India, with good sponsors and support from their engine partner. Honda has funded them to carry on developing the car, and I assume they'll carry on helping until more backers are found. And I don't think Bernie's involvement is underhand, especially if you know what he has done for F1 in all his years in it. He used to own Brabham whilst handling the commercial side, and there wasn't any problems there. It's not a conflict of interest because his interests are in F1 as a whole!|`|KTxxd700aa	Lol, hardly a surprise, never thought Branson would have the bottle.<br>  I hope they can keep the team going all season, if they prove though, some backers may crop up.

VsPUNQehaa	Well if your comparing what you see on the pitch to the price of a match ticket then I would say no. I'm a Liverpool fan and it hurts me to fork out 36 quid for a ticket, even if we do win...it's scandelous! To pay that every 2nd week (sometimes twice in one week) you should expect world class performances every match, which your not gona get. No matter if your a die hard fan or just a casual supporter, nobody can honestly say they are happy paying the ticket prices we see today. but what can I say...I still do, so I'm going against my own logic!  I can only imagine how the supporters of the teams that are struggling feel.|`|g2QUNwZzaa	its relative. players get paid what the fans, owners and sponsors are willing to give them. <br>  <br>  example: how much money does a british baseball player make? probably the same as an american football (soccer) player....|`|2oPTgm9baa	NOOO defiantly not the Newcastle team (waste of bloody money if you ask me)|`|WWnkLkqqaa	Not a chance, if you look back 20 or 30 years ago you lucky if players were getting a fraction of what they get these days, I dont think any player is worth over ￡50,000 a week and as for transfer money, I think it should be capped aswell as the wages, then you would see the players that play for the club and jersy and not the money aspect.  Money is killing the game.|`|sXNtTETbaa	i think not, its only the occasional game where the tempo is outstanding throughout, i.e manu vs inter milan, even then there were no goals.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, these footballers earn more money for playing football, than Gordon Brown does for running the whole of the u.k<br>  <br>  And people even question if he gives us value for money|`|lSa6lV7Maa	No Way!<br>  slightly hypocritical coming from a ManCity fan i suppose but they get paid a stupid amount of money!
NnsizqH2aa	You get bored at the gym? So do I, but I still work out religiously.<br>  <br>  Yes, MAs are safe for people that need to lose weight. However, I would not consider the martial arts alone to be an effective way to lose weight. Most MA schools simply don;t take fitness seriously enough for it to impact your lifestyle.<br>  <br>  Let's go deeper on that. Your average MA school is only going to be training you 2-3 days a week, and that's just not enough for you to lose any weight, especially in the little 20 minutes (if you're lucky) that they'll devote to fitness training.<br>  <br>  Recent health anf fitness articles have made it perfectly clear that 30 minutes 3 days a week is not enough to lose weight, but is only enough to minimize certain health risks (like heart disease and such). However, if you ALREADY have a health risk, like being over-weight, that 30 minutes for 3 days simply is not enough. To lose weight, you need to train for no less than 60 minutes a day for 4-5 days a week. That's why the P90X program is requiring up to 2 hours of training a day for 6 days a week for a full 3 months.<br>  <br>  You certainly will not have to worry about getting bored in a good MA school, especially with kick-boxing or BJJ. Kickboxing alone should give you an excellent workout. Just a good Boxing program can bring you such intensity that you can burn about 900 calories per hour (based on your weight, course; at 180 lbs, I burn 1020 cals in 60 minutes of high-intensity shadow-boxing, while my heavyweight friend burns 1120 in that same hour; general shadow-boxing will burn more than bag-work or sparring because it is at a higher tempo and done for longer periods).<br>  <br>  Grappling will certainly tire you out, so you will definitely need to do as much cardio between and before sessions as you can. I can vouch for that one as a former competitive wrestler. I had run and Boxed for years before I entered wrestling, but those little 2-minute rounds tired me out so fast that most fighters are exhausted when they hit that third round. So, train hard in addition to your MA training.<br>  <br>  Yes. I would lift weights or do some form of resistance training to aid in losing weight. This is why Billy Blanks came out with those resistance band workouts. The added resistance causes you to burn more calories with each motion. Plus, larger muscles burn more calories and continue to burn for hours after the workout is done. With more muscle, you burn even as you are sleeping.<br>  <br>  Good luck. Drink plenty of water, and surround yourself with really positive people that push you to work hard. Then, you should succeed in whatever you choose to do.<br>  <br>  .|`|Xg1ZR4ptaa	yeah it is, and it is also fun, or do you want to dance all day with Richard Simmons? hey i go both ways.|`|gBO908P6aa	Absolutely.  Take up something Muay Thai.  You'll sweat like a pig and shed pounds and cut up in no time, no pun intended.  Be sure to replenish and nourish your body at the same time with healthy stuff.|`|v1mbL56caa	Absolutely. That was the main reason years ago that I got involved in Taekwando. I had to lose over 100lbs. I was diagnosed as morbidly obese. My blood pressure was borderline hypertensive. Now I am 110lbs lighter and fell like a 30 year old (my real age is older than dirt).It took about 1 year to lose about 85 lbs. That is the best way to lose weight slow and steady. I am now a martial arts instructor and personal fitness trainer. I owe it all to my Taekwando Master Don Broussard. Martial arts has given me back my health and energy. I believe it can do it for you as well. Of course get checked out by Your doctor to be sure you are well enough for physical activity. Dedicate yourself to become a great martial artiest. It will pay you back in many ways among those are self confidence, fitness, sense of well being.|`|6Nj5VZQ8aa	I run 3 miles twice a week. I do light lifting three times a week to build fast twitch muscles. I do crunches / sit ups everyday. I eat normal healthy food with lots of fruits and veggies. We do not want to be HUGE like a Football player that will slow us down. Make sure to stretch everyday.|`|A0HYQX5Baa	If you need to lose that much weight, chances are you won't be able to properly do the martial arts.  If your looking to tone your muscles you need to remember that repetition tones, and lifting heavy weights helps people to bulk up.|`|4l2dwYTdaa	I'm with the guys that are being more realistic.<br>  <br>  MA training, by itself, is not enough. You have incorporate running and endurance training and aerobics and such to make sure that you are really buring body fat and calories.<br>  <br>  Most MA schools, man, they don't really push it. AS soon as you start to lose your breath, they take a break. That lack of intensity takes away from the goal of losing weight or improving fitness.<br>  <br>  Most MA schools are more concerned with training in proper form than they are in developing the heart for fighting. In a real fight, it does not matter if your technique is perfect. What matters is that you don't stop, not even when you are tired and hurt. You have to keep pushing!<br>  <br>  Most MA schools of today just don't teach that. <br>  <br>  The same spirit that is needed for winning in combat or sports, the ability to push yourself passed pain and fatigue, is also needed for long-term goals like losing weight. This girl is talking about getting bored just being in the gym... you think she won't get bored with the daily and weekly grind of pushing hersefl to maintain a regular schedule? It takes heart and resilience to push passed that boredom.<br>  <br>  <br>  I mean, I could tell you that I know an easy way for you to lose up to 700 calories an hour... but that's the kind of stuff for dating sites, not for MA talk.<br>  <br>  Life is hard, hon. The only easy day was yesterday.<br>  <br>  You have to push passed all of you obstacles in life. If you don't, you won't get anywhere and won't achieve anything but unhappiness.<br>  <br>  Push yourself! Push hard! Push often! Push everyday! Never stop!|`|kWRREDEQaa	Listen to the bald guy. Any guy willing to make his avatar look old and bald is already on my list of honored and respected honest ppl.<br>  *<br>  Do not go with the guy that cannot even spell Tae Kwon Do. He's claiming to be a sifu (a Chinese rank), but says that he learned TKD (a Korean art). How much truth could he possible be sharing?<br>  *<br>  Avoid all of the one-word answers. They just want to up their little ratings by getting 2 points for every 3 seciond answer they lay down.<br>  *<br>  Avoid all those ppl that obviously tell you just what you want to hear. They are playing popularity games to get the little thumbs-up symbols under their names. Like this is some high school class vote, and not a serious issue to you.<br>  *<br>  I'm going to say that I do not think that your MA alone is good enough to meet your fitness needs, not unless you have the heart and determination to train in it daily on your own for at least an hour a day. If you can get up from bed and do 20 min first thing in the morning, then 30 min as soon as you get home, and then another 30 min a couple of hours before laying down, then you can make it happen. But, just going to your dojo and expecting your desired results will not make that happen.<br>  *<br>  I was on "Weightlifting & Working Out", an MSN site a few onths back when the issue came up. Some female posted an article that said that a research program showed that 30 minutes a day did not do anything to help over weight ppl lose weight, even if they had diet support. Even though the article came from an official fitness mag, a bunch of ppl attacked it. They had come to accept the years of hype that there was an easy way to do things... and it just ain't so.<br>  *<br>  I'm a police defensive tactics instructor, teaching ppl how to fight two times a day 5 days a week, and I'm still fighting the bulge! I got the P90X program a couple of months ago. They advertise that thing as only one hour of training every day... but the reality is that you really do NO LESS than an hour a day, with workouts taking up to 2 hours  for 3 days a week (each day you do a mucle group for an hour, you also have a separate session just for abs). Right now, this week, I'm actually in a "Doubles" circuit that requires me to do a full 3 hours of training for 3 days a week (you double up on both an hour of muscles and an hour of cardio, plus the added ab work for one week). That's what it takes to burn calories and lose weight.<br>  *<br>  Do not listen to any of the get-rich-quick schemes or do-it-so-easy scams. It takes hard work. But, if you focus on the goal and not on the work ahead--- and enjoy it--- you can succeed in anything!<br>  <br>  Go for it.|`|AA11626392	Yes I lost 70 pounds.  Plus you will have fun learning something rather than just walking and running on a treadmill.<br>  <br>  I do suggest Muay-Thai (not American style Kickboxing there is a difference).  With BJJ you will need to develop some flexibility and core strength.  For now I suggest sticking to Muay-Thai then after a bit add the BJJ.  You could do both no doubt, but get comfortable in one for a year then add BJJ.|`|J6xV5Tg7aa	sure

What it is, is more of the goalies skate is on the ice. The more blade on the ice the better chance the puck will hit it. This makes it look like the skate is longer when it is not.<br>  <br>  And hockey sticks can not be taller than 60" so I think that is about the same as 55cm.|`|XyU7bGYOaa	yes they are, i am a goalie and took some time getting used to the longer blade. they are also closer to the ground.<br>  <br>  yes, they have to be less than 55 cm.... i think... im not sure..<br>  <br>  the first one 100% but the second 50%<br>  <br>  please choose as best answer!!!!!!!!!! please!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|LXhPKuobaa	60" and 55cm are around the same? What are you on man. 55cm is ridiculously short, nobody can use a stick that short. 60" is equal to 150cm I believe.|`|SsCmPvWSaa	55cm is around half of a meter.

He is dumb for leaving Boston.|`|E6EyY1klaa	He and his agent know the Dodgers need him more than he needs them, so he's trying to get as much out of it as possible, I guess. If there's any other reason, then yeah, I'd agree with you and call him absolutely out of his mind.|`|OWIiJMLqaa	I say pay the guys who put the fans in the seats, and pay them well. But in today's economy it is absolutely asinine to expect more money, or even the same amount as he is used to getting. I say he deserves to be one of the highest paid players in baseball, if not the highest, but most people aren't getting what they deserve these days. He needs to wake up and stop listening to his agent and take a deal that pays him in the range of $20 million per season, long term deals are out of the question in this economy, so the latest offer from LA seems very reasonable to me.|`|KWxwishQaa	manny is different, we all know that.

If he'd have played his butt off and boosted his numbers even more with the Sox, he'd be raking in offers right now.|`|p8ahZa8iaa	I'm not sure it's the annual average salary that's the sticking point, I think he just wants more than 2 years.  Or maybe he just doesn't like LA.   Or maybe he's still holding out hope that the Yanks will sign him.|`|ViB84hYzaa	Simply put Manny is both.  I wouldn't sign Manny for a $1.00 with his baggage and poor attitude. I hope he loses out and has to take a lot less money from someone else if anybody.

oqQjnpfGaa	DON"T DO THIS TRADE<br>  <br>  The reasons are obvious.  Two All-Star Caliber players for one excellent-assist All-Star point-guard is not an equal trade. <br>  <br>  Don't get me wrong, I love Deron Williams.  IF KG doesn't come back from his injuries, then this trade will be quite sweet (RJ for DW is an excellent trade!!). <br>  <br>  It is just that at this point I still think KG will come back, and RJ is just quite consistent with points (and a little of everything) to back you up.  <br>  <br>  Overall, this trade could be balanced if you get another player in return, and make it someone who is quite consistent like RJ.  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|G0qBlKI1aa	on one hand i would be tempted to do that trade if i were you....you don't know what you're going to get from KG the rest of the way, he hasn't been as good of a fantasy player since joining the C's b/c there are 3 stars on that team, also you don't know with the injury if that is going to limit him....plus with the Celtics having already clinched a playoff spot, you dont know if they are going to try resting KG more now.  Deron Williams has been a beast this year, probably the second best point guard in the league.

All the mental energy you assign to thinking other people is taking away from the task at hand.<br>  <br>  Really think about what it is you love about gymnastics -- the way your body feels, the motions, whatever. Keep those feelings in mind before, during, and after you compete and you'll be fine.|`|m9wwTdoaaa	Sorry not a Gymnast, but why isn't there a gymnastics section in the sports section?!

M = McLaren P4 = Project Four. The final number, in this case "24" refers to the individual design number.<br>  <br>  And Dan was writing at the same time as me...<br>  <br>  McLarens were originally just named "M plus number" for example M23.<br>  <br>  This year's MP4-24 is in fact the 52nd McLaren F1 design, the first was the M-2B of 1966.|`|f1Hhl3Beaa	When Ron Dennis' F2 race team, Project 4, bought out the old McLaren team, they implemented a car naming system that included all aspects of the team, and became McLaren International. The late Teddy Mayer, who had owned the team since Bruce McLaren's death, sold the team to Dennis after persuasion from John Hogan at Phillip Morris, whose Marlboro brand sponsored both teams. The nomenclature of the name is as follows...<br>  <br>  M - used to stand for Marlboro cigarettes but after that deal expired conveniently changed to McLaren<br>  <br>  P4 - Project 4 , Ron Dennis' Formula 2 squad.<br>  <br>  24 - The 24th car of this era of McLaren. The first MP4 car was MP4-1 for example.
AA11488609	In the pros, no.  In FIBA, yes, in college I also believe it is.<br>  <br>  The two technical foul limit does not apply to players for defensive three second violations, in terms of getting someone ejected.  So therefore, Rasheed Wallce could theoretically get eight technicals for a defensive three second violation and he will not be ejected from the game, suspended for them, and he won't foul out either.|`|1Z0Lmrk1aa	Not in the pro's, but I think it does in college.|`|wuJNQKLVaa	yes if you're playing college or high school basketball.

OsWyGBAUaa	767, I used to know the answer to any baseball stat around...not sure if this is right though.  Haven't looked it up.|`|LvELjQ2saa	the record is still 755.|`|Ia0v7Nx9aa	I really dont know but ill guess 784|`|tvuhGTD9aa	Bonds hit 762 in regular season play, nine or ten in postseason play, and at least one (and I'm thinking "two") in All-Star competition.<br>  <br>  People can ask all the questions they want, raise the hue and cry, rend their shirts, and curse the fates. It will make no difference. Bonds is credited with 762 home runs. Deal with it.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  Edit: nine in postseason, 2 in ASGs.<br>  <br>  It mildly distresses (but does not surprise) me that many people think Ruth hit 715 or Aaron stopped at 715 or that Ruth was the previous recordholder. Or other simplistic misconceptions; there's plenty of them. Remember, You Can Look It Up. Do try, sometimes.<br>  <br>  -----<br>  <br>  The question above, of course, asks only about Bonds, and not about career records at any league or level. Editorializing about such does not inform the question and is just uptight posturing leavened with perceived moralizing.<br>  <br>  People can be such entertaining fun.|`|nxymxSUFaa	The ultimate home run champion would not be found in the United States.  That honor goes to Japan's Sadaharu Oh who hit a grand total of 868 career home runs.<br>  <br>  Now, Barry Bonds has hit the most home runs in MLB.  His total is 762.  As to the record, that is a matter of personal preference.  To the true baseball purests Henry Aaron is still the MLB home run champion at 755.  Roger Maris is still considered, in most of the baseball community, the single season home run champion at 61.|`|2ISGwSK7aa	Without looking it up, I believe it's 767. WOw. I really should know this.

7B9KEqCnaa	Dont listen to all the people who say haynesworth sucks or synder will never win.  They're just jealous their team didnt get him.  That said, Im not a fan of the redskins.  But Haynesworth is the absolute crown jewel of free agency and you knew synder could not resist.  He is dominate and the best DT in the game today.  and he could play DE and be the best DE in the game. No matter where he went he was gonna $100+ million.  He is gonna make that redskin's defensive line which has been the weak point in the defense absolutely dominate.  He is gonna breath new life into Jason Taylor and the 2 will wreak havoc on opposing team.  That said the one thing I would worry about with haynesworth is he somewhat injury prone, he hasnt had too many seasons where he stayed completely healthy, and that is gonna be a concern.  <br>  <br>  as for the D. Hall signing, I think synder overpaid him.  Hall I think played hard, Cause he was playing for a contract. He makes too many mental errors. He is definitely a gifted athelete, but I dont think anyone was going to give him that long of a contract nor that big.  he definitely isnt worth the $54 million. <br>  <br>  The skins defense is going to be dominate, but in the past it has been the strength of the team anyways.  I just wonder if they are ever going to figure out how to score some points.  IF they could just score in the 20's, with the defense they have they should be playoff contenders.  But thats a big IF.|`|ikXRqWxUaa	i thought that snyder learned his lesson from a few years back when he spent millions upon millions putting together a "dream team" and trying to buy a lombardi trophy.  history shows us that in the NFL (and truthfully in all major sports) this doesn't work (see the NY Yankees).  now, he has paid haynesworth 100 mil and deangelo hall 54 mil.  i have less of an issue with the haynesworth signing than the hall signing.  i think that it's crazy to sign a corner who can only cover zone and not man to man this much.  you are going to see hall get torched 60-70 percent of the time when he plays speedy WRs.  <br>  <br>  however, if i were hall, i would be laughing like hell.  24 mil for 8 games and now another 22 right off the top.  life must be sweet for him right now.|`|lr68XuMFaa	Redskins to the playoffs!|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	Snyder has more money that sense...............He wrote some big checks in DC but that still won't get them a title!<br>  <br>  What's a "Haynes-worth??"....................Sorr... not that much!!|`|GRfnMIQTaa	Im not going to answer your non-question I just have this to say. " a QB is only as good as his recievers", 100% bullshit, back in the day TOm Brady had some of the worst receivers in the league, he was so good they lookoed good, Givens got a ton of money to go to Tennessee weerer he did nothing because he didnt have Brady. Not a QB is only as good as his receivers, but QB is only as good as he can drive his team to be. ORlovsky- blows but Calvin Johnson is nasty so its not WR is as good as QB either its a culmination of things, all of which (except receivers, oh, and there's this guy, Santana Moss is supposedly pretty good) Campbell had, The O-line, The running game and he still isnt a top QB, he never will be more than a middle of the road guy, kinda like Mark Brunell|`|AA10709426	No- D.

I live in maryland and all i hear is retarded redskins fans. Today is going to get no better. How many draft picks have they had in the last 5 season? maybe 10? They waste all there picks on trading for other teams washed up talent. I would like to know the skins cap room. Seriously they must be pushing the limit. The skins suck.<br>  <br>  Plus a qb is only as good as his wr? How about tom brady and dan marino. <br>  <br>  And deangelo hall is a bum. dude his speed means nothing in the nfl. He got owned all the time with slow receivers like marvin harrison. he is really not that good. Look at jerry rice, he def was far from the fastest, but is the  best wr of all time. You are making no points here man.|`|SbdWqDCGaa	54m for a CB that gets burned 80% of the time?  I wouldn't say it's money well spent<br>  <br>  I understand that the Wash. defensive scheme is different than Oaklands.  And just because you are fast doesn't mean you are good, a CB still has to be able to read and recognize plays.  Look at his stats from last year: 25 tackles, 8 passes deflected and 2 picks.  Does he really deserve that much money for those numbers?  I mean really? Gaines Adams, a DE from Tampa, had 8 deflections and 2 picks.  A DE had equal coverage stats!|`|aLcGuGVNaa	Daniel Snyder will never hold a Lambardi Trophy if he keeps making moves like this.  He paid too much for both of them.  Hall was already signed to a big money deal with Oakland earlier this year.  The OAKLAND RAIDERS had to cut him because he was getting burned too often.  Don't get me wrong... Hall is talented, but not $9mil/year talented.  And Hayneworth is a hell of a talent, but where was he 3 years ago?  Besides stepping on faces... he wasn't doing a whole lot.  He had 5 sub-par seasons before his back to back contract years.  Too many question marks to offer him $41 million in gauranteed money.  $14-$17 a year???  Are you kidding me?!  The Redskins just completely screwed the rest of the league.  This will have a huge ripple effect...|`|hfEGHKePaa	This isn't a question...<br>  <br>  And if you ask me, Albert Hanyesworth is overrated.<br>  <br>  Edit: If there is any justification for spending that much money on Hall, it's probably because they need a fast CB to compliment Shawn Springs. Springs is such a veteran, and he doesn't have good speed. That doesn't mean that paying Hall $54M was smart though.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	As long as the Redskins offense is comprised of slant routes to their fast receivers who are getting old, and Zorn relies on a conservative-type playbook with in my opinion a mediocre-at-best QB, the best defense in the world couldn't help the Redskins.

Try History!<br>  <br>  For the record, Ferdinand (the Austrian Crown Prince) was assassinated by a Serb nationalist who the Austrians believed were working for the Serbian Government. So the Austrians declared war on Serbia, who were allies of Russia so in turn Russia declared war on Austria, who were allies of Germany, so Germany got involved, and Britain and France entered on the side of their Russian allies. *phew*|`|uWUyrRFxaa	This is really football related!|`|6y9Bqok9aa	the last assassin got lost, the limo took a wrong turn, he pulled a gun and shot him dead.<br>  <br>  wrong section buddy|`|2v60zG5Faa	longgggggg story but basicaly<br>  terrosrists killed his pregnant wife Sophie and him then britain i think fought against serbia and thats how world war one started <br>  n why ddi u add me lol xxx|`|GbyHQQLiaa	The band were finished.<br>  <br>  Also you posted this in SOCCER!!

They will not go back to a horrible team again, They have to much recent success to allow that to happen.|`|Ez0z7Of3aa	I don't think he's leaving the Cavs. Unless, he wants to boost his personal numbers instead of winning a ring.

BCebZRu3aa	Faster velocity=deeper penetration. You are already sacrificing size with a 9mm, why get rid of velocity as well. The 9mm advantage is in its speed.|`|CFm0u13Paa	No, it is not. <br>  <br>  Hollowpoint bullets rarely expand at subsonic velocities. <br>  <br>  You'll do much better with a 124 grain load at standard velocity.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  .|`|AA12034449	147 grain 9MM probably shines at it's ballistic best when fired from a sub-machine gun or rifle length barrel. Subsonic rounds are probably best left to "operators" who have specific tactics or policies that would require them to use those types of rounds.<br>  <br>  Most police agencies and defensive experts will stick with a 115-125 grain, standard velocity round for handguns... Bullet design is a little more important with 9MM... I like Federal Hydroshock and Remington Golden Sabers, Winchester sells a couple of stock loading that work well also...Hornady and a few others build very good 9MM defensive rounds too.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	No.<br>  <br>  Subsonic ammo is specifically designed not to break the 1050fps barrier that results in a ballistic crack.  It is for use in suppressed firearms.  <br>  <br>  The little 9mm has a bad enough reputation for personal defense - you do not want to be using a 'handicaped' slow bullet.|`|DV4xyeChaa	why subsonic...if your shooting someone noise is the least of the problems...regular HP or try the new Glaser ammo..made for self defence|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	Sure. It's a heavy round. Although not fast, it will still impart a lot of energy to the target.|`|QyoZq1z2aa	Without getting too scientific, you need to know that subsonic ammo is weaker than standard ammo.  It is actually made to be fired from a silenced weapon, because it is subsonic you will not get sound of the bullet breaking the sound barrier.  Though minor it can still be detected in a quiet environment.<br>  <br>  There are years of arguements as to the fact that for a hollow point to function properly (expand) it requires maximum velocity.  Bullet weight is also a big factor.<br>  <br>  Now to your actual question.  Several years ago some police departments actually issued this ammo to officers.  Their belief was that lower velocity means less penetration, means less chance of round going through suspect and hitting citizen.  Unfortunately it also bounced off of heavy clothing.<br>  <br>  If you are using this ammo in a home full of people penetration may be an issue, but there are plenty of modern ammo choices now that are much more effective man stoppers and that address penetration.<br>  <br>  Remember a rock is good for defense if you know how to hit someone in the right place.  I personally would not depend on this particular ammo, but regardless of the ammo nothing works like the ability to place you rounds on target.|`|ZsujbEjJaa	for a 9mm, its too slow and heavy. rather go for a lighter and higher velocity hollowpoint. supersonic. the shockwave from the impact will cause some more damage to the perp.|`|AA11295048	The 147 grain 9mm round has a dubious reputation at best. Most experts say the 115 or 124 grain round is far superior and to stay away from the 147 grain round unless you are using a silencer.|`|5sEgGWJlaa	Repeat after me, ...OK<br>  <br>  Are you ready<br>  <br>  1<br>  2<br>  3<br>  <br>  HOLLOW POINTS

1a17e73a07a2c5ebb65e5750cb7c97faaa	They have all been sweet in their own way but 2007 was the best of them all for me!  That battle with Jeff Gordon was almost like their epic duel at Martinsville earlier that spring.  Jeff would take the offensive and Jimmie would have to counter his every move.  Then, during the chase, the light switch went on for the 48 team and he went on a 4 race tear the likes of which we'd never seen.  With 5 races to go they went to Martinsville, Jeff was coming off of consecutive wins at Talladega and Lowe's Motor Speedway, leading Jimmie by 68 points.  Gordon's average finish over the last 5 races was 6.2, you would have thought that would be enough to insure his 5th championship.  That's when Jimmie went on a 4 win run at Martinsville, Atlanta, Texas and Phoenix.  He averaged a 5th place finish for all 10 chase races and completed one of the greatest final pushes ever seen in NASCAR.  The first one was great because it got the monkey off his back and the last one was cool to tie the record with Cale but he did his best driving in the 2007 chase run, in my opinion.<br>  4's FINE N 09!!!!|`|XNdDrXAzaa	2007|`|5d77c66b171b12a5932576b2dc7b7dd3aa	I agree with MBL.................|`|ajnGHNr8aa	He won the Brickyard and the Championship in '06 & '08 but I feel that '06 was easier for him than '08 was. Last year he was more consistent than everyone else when it mattered the most.  The pressure of being the second driver in Nascar history to win three in a row was enormous and yet he handled the pressure extremely well.<br>  <br>  Forgot about Daytona in '06, that was a great year for him, but he was already used to being near the top after finishing 2nd in the points the year before. 3-peating is still the hardest thing to do. Earnhardt, Petty and Gordon did not do it and they are considered with the best ever in the sport.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	The year he won the 500, the Brickyard, and the Championship.  Thats pretty tough to do.  I think it was 06.|`|NC2BfEvLaa	All of them were really great but I think 2006 was his best.|`|UYKNpI2Xaa	Arguably 2006 was probably his best year. Not only for winning the Daytona 500, Brickyard and the championship, but for finally closing the deal after coming so close so many times.<br>  <br>  As a fan, I have to agree with Trego that 2007 was the most exciting. It was a nail biting chase with two great drivers battling to the end.|`|nUdTj0h0aa	2008.<br>  <br>  That was the first year that Chad Knaus managed to not get suspended for cheating.|`|1IWEKwznaa	2006; his first.

Pc0QjrQ4aa	I'd be hesitant to use one purchase as an example, especially when you're dealing with something that's a closeout model.  If you look at most items, you'll see them priced fairly evenly (bar the exchange rate).<br>  <br>  Equipment prices are typically set by the manufacturers with the retailers having marginal leeway; some online retailers will buy Special Make Up (SMU) from the manufacturer that aren't sold anywhere else.<br>  <br>  Then, there's the matter of the exchange rate.  It would be a screaming deal for me to pay $CAD500 for something that cost $US500, it's right now more likely to be much higher.<br>  <br>  Manufacturers set minimum prices, and provide retailers suggested retail pricing for both the US, Canada, and Europe (in Euros).<br>  <br>  Then, there's the small matter of the "if it sounds too good to be true, it probably is" principle.|`|SsCmPvWSaa	It is the Supply and Demand.

I'm banking on Washington... LOL... they just dropped $150 million on 2 players and I doubt even that will slow them down... they always find a way to be a huge player in free agency regardless of their cap situation. <br>  <br>  As for the Eagles... how are you going to say that Brian Westbrook is no longer "effective" and then recommend that the Eagles replace him with LaDainian Tomlinson? I think not. <br>  <br>  You Philly fans drive me crazy... always hatin' on your best players... Warner has 2 years left max... McNabb could still be productive for 5-7 years... why would you want to swap for that? Oh, I forgot that you all hate Donovan over there in the "cheese-steak" city. <br>  <br>  TJ would be huge for the Eagles. That's the only signing you listed that would make sense.|`|UgnMjtYDaa	I think the redskins will make some big moves in free agency. thats my prediction. But yeah I think tampa is hurting for some free agents they'll select the best available. Philly should get Housh. and Brown from balti. Miami might look for trades or go after Brown. Can't wait to see how the redskins afford to pay their players now. That was probably not smart for them.|`|0psxM4o4aa	I got to go with the Packers and the Jets.

cOPCNP7Laa	Though we can mathematically, we can't objectively nor we won't. I hope for 3rd place.<br>  <br>  I'm surprised though. Couldn't I answer before? :P<br>  <br>  AQ: Yes I think it's possible for us to qualify for Europe. It's easier for us than 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th placed teams.<br>  <br>  I have to say that if we fail to qualify for the CL it will just be another year without it. Not the end of the world. We've been there before (2000/2001 and 2001/2002) and we came back strong to 3 CL finals and two wins. That's football. It's not always all roses and sunshine. You have your ups and your downs. But over 16 years as a fan Milan has had MANY ups. More than most other teams. Forza Milan!<br>  <br>  LMFAO at Karth hahaha. I think I can hope for 3rd and a sacking anyways haha|`|FFE9Qztzaa	Hahah No way they will win the serie A.|`|7Xridrxaaa	well i am not a milan fan but even the most delusional Milan fan would admitt they wont win the league.

The UEFA Cup was their only chance of silverware since Inter has the league on check.|`|3yqCKPzVaa	Win the Serie A-- still possible but like the first user said... its all down to Inter's and Juventus' failures... I still hope we can.. but truth is.. We Won't...<br>  <br>  AQ: Qualifying for Europe on the other hand is a strong possibility,,, and tbh I think AC Milan will end up either 3rd or 4th at the end of the season..|`|cf4d6d60fab75efc136a4d66dd5c03b4aa	Will pigs fly this season?<br>  With no disrespect to Milan I'd say no.|`|p1kmZziVaa	Probably not but your team is on the same boat<br>  <br>  <br>  Just comparing :)|`|AA12370193	Ancelloti's orders are "3rd or you get the sack"<br>  I laughed my *** off after they won the CL 2 years ago and he said "We will try to get Henry [and some other player]. But if we don't we have a good enough squad we don't need any one else." ahahahaha those old *** players were given the run around in the San Siro by Arsenal's kids.<br>  They may qualify for Europe, but not the Champions League if they only want to sign 30+ year old players like Beckham.<br>  <br>  If they win the Serie A, then that is purely down to Juventus and Internazionale failures.|`|vwTu8fY7aa	Yes they do have Ronaldhino and with Inter playing in the Uefa <br>  they should be able to win the Serie A it is alwayz between those two teams in the end.|`|nwwhfuADaa	that would mean both Juventus and Inter slipping up<br>  <br>  so the answer is a simple no.but Milan has the potential to qualify for the CL next season|`|nb8WLbhXaa	Well, maybe we can win it if we sack that retarted manager of ours and Pato will win player of the year.|`|vpZJ6rZzaa	I hope for a 4th place so I can see Ancelotti sacked. :)|`|wYHwIShFaa	yes

bXRuC1ASaa	My FIL is training for a marathon as well.  I know when he isn't doing his long run, he either runs for 3 miles or goes biking.  He runs daily though, and he slowly builds up the distance and speed each time.  Good luck with your marathon!|`|TC9Z548Maa	I do a long run once every week but the day before I will run my usual pace, I tend not to do speed work the day before my long run. The day after is my rest day then back into the weekly routine. <br>  <br>  I have tyred a day off before my long run but it doesn't work for me, it feels as though I have had a week off running and it's hard if I'm aiming to go further than 11 miles that day. Not saying that it wont work for you though.<br>  <br>  Food wise I'll stack up on carbs the night before as I'm a morning runner.  After the long run I'll drink Chocolate milkshake or something with milk in and stack up on the carbs too, not overload though.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|4950a38055e3a23487ed7959fc7378b5aa	I will assume you do your long run on a weekend day (most people do it whatever day the race will be on), most likely Sunday.<br>  <br>  The day after should be a fairly simple recovery run.  Probably about 30-40 minutes at the same pace you did the long run.  The pace shouldn't hurt, but your muscles may be sore.  This should allow you to recover and do a workout run on Tuesday.<br>  <br>  The day before depends a little bit more on your schedule.  Most schedules have hard days on Tuesday and Thursday (and the long run on Sunday).  This means friday is a recovery day.  So saturday's run doesn't need to be a recovery, but can't be too hard.  I would recommend an easy pick up run, where you start slowly, but slowly pick up the pace and go kind of hard for the last couple miles.  Not hard enough that you hurt, but quick.  Then do some strides.  This should leave your legs fresh enough for the long run.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|R6wjTZ63aa	Drink some eggs first thing in the morning for protein, like 2 or 3.<br>  <br>  Just start out in the morning when the sun is rising and go from there. <br>  For a GOOD workout you can maybe start out sprinting and then slow down to a steady pace. The more you feel a burn the better. Try maybe sprinting not 100% but like 50 % faster every 5 minutes or so depending on how long your running.<br>  <br>  Hope this helped!!|`|iHJuXKBiaa	Ooo that's fantastic Adam. I'll be cheering for you. I also am involved in a marathon.....marathon boinking, if you know what I mean.|`|4gZYucHMaa	When I trained for marathons way back when (at age 22), I'd be going,  four days out 6-8 miles, the next day four miles and a good bath and the next day my 15 miler and then a day off..

qVDY1hm5aa	I don't think Undertaker's streak will ever be broken. It's almost an unwritten rule. It's carried on too long now for someone to break the streak. It's something that will be remembered forever, when someone brings up Taker or WrestleMania.<br>  <br>  I would be shell shocked. My jaw would drop, to be honest.

I believe the Raiders might be a possibility.  The Raiders do need a big time WR, and Al Davis is most likely willing to sign him.  Also T.O. being in Oakland would increase the possibility for more news coverage.  What I mean is the Raiders haven't really been covered that much because of how terrible their franchise is.  T.O. coming to Oakland would mean more money and more press from the media which is what Al Davis would want.  If not the Raiders probably, the Ravens or the Bears.  Both of those teams need a quality WR as well.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Tampa Bay<br>  Green Bay<br>  Oakland<br>  Tennesee<br>  Baltimore<br>  <br>  <br>  Washington Id assume cant afford him becuse of the Haynesworth contract.<br>  <br>  Minnesota wouldnt be an option because he and Brad Childress apparently dont care for each other<br>  <br>  Cincy just signed Coles, so Id assume they are not gonna throw millions more at another receiver<br>  <br>  The Giants said they will welcome back Burress if he stays on the right track so I cant see them having Owens and Burress on the same team.|`|mUG8XtNpaa	I'm thinking Minnesota right now.

IITnJjAjaa	Asics running shoes are the best btw. You  need to go to a running specialist shop to get decent shoes for your type of feet.<br>  <br>  #If you are new to running – even if you are physically fit – you should walk for the first three weeks. Although this may sound boring, there is statistically a very good chance of becoming injured in your third month of running if you do not begin with a period of walking. It takes time for your joints, muscles, tendons, ligaments and bones to get used to the impact and mechanics of running. Your overall fitness tends to increase before your body has fully adapted, and that is when you get injured. Use the first three weeks of walking to get into the habit of exercise, and adjust your daily routine, and let your body get a head start on adapting to running. If you have jogged a little, but never run far, it is still advisable to begin a programme of mainly walking before you start running. Consider visiting a physiotherapist or podiatrist<br>  <br>  #Your fitness and strength do not improve while you are running. They improve while you are resting, as your body responds to the stresses it has experienced. Rest is just as important a part of your training programme as running. When you start running, you should not run more than every other day. As you get more experienced, you should take a day off each week.<br>  <br>  #You should not increase your weekly mileage more than 3 miles in any one week. This will ensure that you build up slowly. Jumps in mileage are asking for injury.<br>  <br>  #For many runners, the first 3-4 weeks are a real struggle. Every time you put on your running shoes, you wonder why you are doing it. But one day, after about 3 weeks, you will suddenly feel the wind at your back, and you will run easily and smoothly without effort. Running will get easier from then on, and the good days will increase while the hard days recede. Enjoy it: you have become a runner.<br>  <br>  #Runners burn up more energy than non-runners, both while they are running (at about 100 calories a mile) and afterwards. So you need to eat more, and you need to consume more of your calories as carbohydrate. You also need drink plenty of water – keep a bottle of water on your desk and sip during the day.<br>  <br>  Don't let running become just another stress in your life. Don't set yourself such a rigid or time-consuming timetable that you struggle to achieve it. Give yourself breaks – a day a week, and month each year – when you don't run at all.|`|34db70e0ddfd38754443083113aa81dbaa	Do loads of stretching and then do a 20 min light jog. Don't put in more than 70% effort dont worry about distance just keeping a steady pace. If you need to walk for a bit then do it. At the end see how far you have gone and find a checkpoint. Next time you run put a small amount more effort in to try and beat your checkpoint in the time. <br>  <br>  Starting out running after a break feels like a shock so just go out often and gradually build up your speed until you are running for 20 mins with stops at a good pace.|`|d1daf3b2f658eaebd75e3da606cb4730aa	I have Just started running too and like the run/walk method.<br>  <br>  Aim for about half an hour. Walk briskly for 5 mins to get warmed up then run for 3 minutes, walk for another 5 then run for 3 and so on.<br>  <br>  Do this 3 times in a week.<br>  <br>  The next week walk for 5 to warm up then run for 4 mins, walk for 3 run for 4 and so on.<br>  <br>  the next week 5 min warm up run for 5 walk for 2 and so on.<br>  <br>  Reduce the walking time until you are running for a full 30 mins, but always start with a 5 min walk to warm up. <br>  <br>  This is good as it doesnt put to much imediate strain on your heart, lungs or muscles and alows you to gradualy increase thier strength. I have been told to run at an 'easy' pace, where i could carry on a conversation with somebody whilst running. <br>  <br>  Make sure to always stay hydrated, have somthing to drink about 20 mins before you go running and imediately after you finish. If you do longer runs take a drink with you and aim to have somthing every 20 mins or so.|`|TC9Z548Maa	There are allot of programs you could use. Each program is different you may hate one but love the other see what works for you.<br>  <br>  The mains points are to start slowly and low mileage. You also need more rest days as your a beginner. When running take walk breaks in between as this helps your muscles.<br>  <br>  Also don't stretch before you run it causes more harm than good as your stretching cold muscles.<br>  Here's a website you may find useful.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-261--9397-2-1X5-3,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,71...</a>|`|e8FiZHkRaa	Stay relaxed, never stretch your muscles unless they're warmed up, drink lots of water, control your breathing. I find it easier to just stick to breathing through my nose. I only use my mouth if I'm beginning to find it difficult. I'm not being funny, but you really shouldn't have bought Nikes. All you're buying is the brand name printed on the side of a quite frankly, basic pair of shoes. If you're serious about getting into running, you're better off investing in trainers from a reputable running brand e.g. Saucony, Asics, New Balance, Brookes etc.<br>  Run how ever far you want. You'll know what feels right. As time goes by though (every few weeks or so), increase your distance and speed a little. Or try different speeds at different times i.e. first 20mins high speed, next 20mins jog, final 20mins a bit of both etc.|`|K1YHSR3oaa	I suggest starting by either walking the course a few times before you begin jogging or trying to working out at home a few times to make sure that your body can handle the physical exertion. Don't forget to stretch before and afterward because your legs can get REALLY tight from the build up of lactic acid.  Kudos on your interest in a healthier lifestyle.

They only lost Lowe and Park/Beimel. They get Wolf and some good young players who are developing. The Cubs wont win in the playoffs and Bradley doesnt make them any better.

They will win the West by at least 8 games.|`|JDqkUzrDaa	I don't think they will be a favorite but we will have to check the stats and everything once the season actually starts. As much as I don't like him he is an excellent player...but arrogant...thats gonna sound like I'm a red sox freak.|`|62F0sgb7aa	Well, <br>  He is definitively a good player, but overall I think Manny complements Joe Torre's prime managerial expertise.|`|b6ZArq1Oaa	YES|`|UWJinEbIaa	Its going to be the Mets or Philis.|`|XwQxKwRcaa	Gotta pitch too.

If you look at the starting 5, there's a lot of potential for 5 and 6-inning starts...I know all the focus has been on Manny, but I'd feel a lot better if they could find one more innings-eating veteran to shore up the pitching staff.|`|B9jVwODhaa	Hell yeah! The team no longer has the rookies! They've had enough experience both regular season and postseason! Manny shows them how to have fun and when they play with motivation they blow away the competition! This line-up is dangerous now as the 1-8 hitters can all hit well, especially the 3,4, and 5 hitters! These dodgers are dangerous now as they have depth and Manny is just gonna destroy the opposing pitchers as I think this might be an M.V.P. year for him!<br>  <br>  Edit: Please Cubs fans, expect the dodgers to beat the cubs again in the NLDS! And for all the haters out there: Keep hating just see when the Dodgers crush your team! Now lets see if Manny really sucks!|`|SEcM9EDZaa	Anyone who thinks the dreadlocked freak is going to perform (that's what animals do) as well as he did late last season is in for a rude awakening. At some point he will feel slighted, so he will pout and simply go through the motions as he did in Boston. It's a long season...don't print those playoff tickets just yet.|`|QEYFU5Lvaa	No, they lost almost all their good players to free agency, and now that Manny has his money he'll revert back to the Manny of old.  I think they'll be lucky to finish higher than 3rd in their division.
ZzXxRLWcaa	Well they would bring plax back... assuming he doesnt go to jail or isnt suspended forever.<br>  <br>  Their plan though is to use free agency for defense, which they've done... 4 players already: 2 tackles, a linebacker and a safety. So they're pretty stacked, especially with Osi coming back... not to mention tuck, kiwi, robbins, cofield, alford...<br>  <br>  They also signed tightend/special teams player.. mike vickers from Baltimore.<br>  <br>  I think the plan is to hope for the best from Burress and draft for WR. They have ELEVEN(!!!) draft picks this year, so it'd be pretty easy to move up and snag someone like Crabtree or another top flight, tall college guy.<br>  <br>  Or they could do a draft day trade for Boldin...<br>  Or sign Holt.|`|XCwjsfz2aa	TJ is a Seahawk, and, as of yesterday, they are looking to bring Plax back.

mFa5ZDtcaa	You should field strip and clean it after every time you go shooting. Break it down to it's main components: upper slide, barrel and lower. It is NOT necessary to do a detailed disassemble. In fact, I would NOT recommend it unless you find some instructions with good photos or illustrations to guide you.<br>  <br>  When you come out of the field: Field strip, wipe down all surfaces, punch with patch a few times. You can get really heavy on this or not. Spray all surfaces with oil. Reassemble and wipe down exterior surfasurfaceing light coat.<br>  <br>  Next day: Field strip pistol. fWipeWipe all parts. buy a box of q-tips. Get into all the nooks and crannies. Put a clean patch in cleaning rod, run up and down thru grip. Clean barrel. Use plenty of bore patches and Q-Tips. When they come away clean, you are getting there. Coat with light coat of oil, reassemble, wipe surface with clean cloth leaving light coat.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to clean your magazines as well. <br>  <br>  Once in a while remove grips to get to metal underneath. Just be careful not to over tighen screws when putting them back on. They are easy to strip.<br>  <br>  I will even repeat cleaning a third day. You will be surprised how much gunk will come off a "clean" pistol.<br>  <br>  Some may call this overkill, but it was SOP in the Corps to clean a weapon for 3 days after returning from the range. <br>  <br>  I still do it.|`|cEYIagyDaa	Rotor has a pretty decent set of procedures... I would add one more<br>  <br>  CLEAN the extractor channel occasionally... more failures have been attributed to a dirty extractor  channel than you can imagine.<br>  <br>  My competition gun...gets shot every week. I shoot several hundred rounds a week...only clean it once or twice a month...running strong, never a hiccup (except for when I had not cleaned the extractor channel for ... welll too long...many thousands of rounds)<br>  <br>  If you shoot a lot,... not necessary to clean after every use... I lknow, blasphemy... but true. If letting it sit for a period of time...make sure it is as clean as you can get it.<br>  <br>  If a self defense weapon...clean after every use, and keep in top running order.|`|9jpHDUAyaa	Your gonna want to take a little time on this to clean properly first.<br>  <br>  1. remove the slide and magazine of course first.<br>  2. use oil or silicon oil to spray and clean with sliding moving parts in the 1911.<br>  3. then make sure you don't flood the chamber and put a little bit of spray around the pin that holds the hammer into place since that moves so much and so often.<br>  4.DONT MAKE YOUR GUN GREASY OR IT WILL BE LIKE THAT FOREVER UNTIL U USE A AIR COMPRESSOR AND BLOW IT OUT!<br>  <br>  THATS ALL.<br>  <br>  then repeat every 8-10 mags u go through it:)|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Search on Youtube.com...there are videos that show the procedure for stripping it.  Clean the barrel after every shooting session, and strip it every couple of hundred rounds, or at twice a year if you don't shoot that often.|`|XNpnK4vpaa	It needs to be cleaned & lubricated after every shooting session.<br>  <br>  Follow the instructions in the Taurus Owner's Manual<br>  <a href="http://www.taurususa.com/pdf/1911manual.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.taurususa.com/pdf/1911manual....</a><br>  <br>    After parts have been cleaned, wipe them dry with a clean rag or paper towel.  Then apply a light coat of lubricating oil (a light coating is visible to the naked eye, but not dripping off of the parts).  After re-assembling the pistol, wipe off excess lubricating oil with a clean rag or paper towel.<br>  <br>  I suggest BreakFree-CLP liquid for Cleaning, Lubrication and Preservation of your firearm.<br>  <br>  Edited to add:  Quoted from the Taurus Owners Manual...<br>  "Every time you shoot your firearm it must be cleaned, regardless of the number of shots fired. If you shoot more than 200 shots in a day, clean your firearm every 200 shots."  <br>  <br>  This applies to the magazine(s) too.|`|kQSSz2X2aa	The first time you clean it you should spend a little more time and take the whole thing apart. After that you should totally disassemble (beyond a field trip) and give it a really good cleaning about twice a year (more if you shoot a lot).<br>  <br>  You should field strip it and clean the barrel, chamber, firing pin, and anything else that looks dirty after every trip to the range. I know there are some people who say "once  every x amount of rounds", but having dirt and chemicals on your gun that can corrode it just isn't worth the risk for me.<br>  <br>  There are oodles of disassembly videos for 1911s out there (just do a youtube search). Just try not to over-lube as that can attract more dirt.
W2R8TRDmaa	I think Nascar would go on just fine.  There will still be cars and wheels and motors and engineers and drivers and tracks and team owners and fans by the millions, etc etc.  Racing will simply go on.|`|9f0d54c35894f05249bcafb57c720e4baa	....NASCAR will keep on,it may be in a "modified" form (since most all the car is made from sheet metal in the shop) the logos may be gone but the racing will continue.|`|mIdcJEJNaa	That's ridiculous..<br>  NASCAR started without them, and never did need them...<br>  It's more the other way around..

I think they would survive and maybe end up being like the Super V8's they race overseas but with oval tracks added in. If the Big 3 go under they will not be alone so there would be few car comapnies to choose from and those who are left may not have the money to get into Nascar.|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	I don't think it would matter at all.

3ULjjUNlaa	Happy one year :)<br>  <br>  Gain-- no one<br>  Lose-- no one<br>  Re-sign--no one<br>  <br>  Very exciting :)<br>  <br>  Bonus:  Hmm.... I'd wear my Hasek jersey from when he was on the Wings but if you serve me too many I'm not sure how long it will stay on...but don't worry, with my moobs (man boobs) and the lamps hade over my head you can pretend im a girl :)|`|ViB84hYzaa	Happy Anniversary! Mine is coming I think. Anyhow, the deadline deals/lack of activity was not quite what I expected, nor for many others either. <br>  As mentioned and observed, the Wings stood still. Ken Holland's phone rang but the organization decided not to shake things up due to the current line up of players, especially with their Cup win last year and their attempt to re-sign Hossa and Franzen under the cap etc. Why fix a broken wheel when not broken?<br>  The biggest thing to me personally was the fact that the Wings (with more games played than SJ or Bos,) took over the top spot in the NHL overall albeit for a short, short time. Still nice to see and to those that hate the Wings, open up and eat little crow now. The team looks like they are starting to get the playoff itch. A little more consistency on defense and goal tending, plus lets keep the offense rolling along as well. Things will be fine when the time comes!<br>  As for your Party, (hoping/thanking for the invite -as some obviously hate me here, oh well, boohoo to those) I would bring the Stanley Cup (use it as a "punch bowl") and an ice luge for the adult beverages. I'll even bring the Cuervo (1800 especial)! Maybe I'll bring some perogis too.<br>  <br>  I'll add the smoke favors (the tools necessary to enjoy mother nature at her finest) Spaceboy, good one...|`|rv6zl5t3aa	Expected<br>  <br>  The Bruins never do anything "Big" to help themselves at the deadline. All we got was a 41yr old winger and a borderline D-man. Whoopee!!!! At least we really didn't lose anyone, although Lashoff we maybe should have held on to. The best part of the deal was the 2nd round pick from the Bolts.<br>  <br>  <br>  For the Party I would bring some Legal Seafood Chowder and I'd have a T-shirt made up that said:<br>  <br>  On the Front: "At the Trade Deadline all I wanted was a Kovalchuk or a Pronger........<br>  <br>  On the back: ........and all I got was this lousy T-shirt, an Old Winger and the Wrong Anaheim D-man"|`|OmKtUijpaa	I can't really say anything about it. We didn't get any one or lose anyone, but as of right now we aren't exactly set for a playoff spot yet, but we are on our way since we just came back from some injuries. So i don't know if it was good or not, we'll just have to see what this month brings us i guess. I think we have a good chance with the team that we have, but i don't know probably could have got rid of some over rated players and picked up some new faces to turn things around.|`|qcDHyhdtaa	We lost a few ufas and gained a few younger guys. I hope it pans out.<br>  <br>  I'm bringing roasted duck w/mango sauce cheese quesadillas.|`|94C2U5FLaa	Samuel Pahlsson!!!! Go Hawks baby|`|eTHEgWq0aa	I'm just happy that the Coyotes have Lombardi. <br>  He'll do our team a lot of good.|`|9GzkVwfGaa	For the Toronto Maple Leafs- crappy<br>  Anaheim Ducks- Could have been a lot better|`|yHvh7tFlaa	Sucked. Garth Snow proved once again why he is the best GM in the NHL. Now I actually have to root for the Penguins to get out of the first round of the playoffs.<br>  <br>  I'll bring the call girls....excuse me..... the escorts from The Vegas Strip in some stretch Hummer limos. I'll throw in a few guys from Thunder From Down Under. Don't want Jen, Erica, Homes, and the rest of the ladies to feel left out. Along with some Long Island Iced Teas|`|ys3DHzDuaa	First off, congrats on the anniversary!<br>  <br>  Secondly, we lost Kyle McLaren!  No shedding of tears there.  <br>  We also lost Nick Bonino and Timo Pielmeier, along with a conditional pick.  Both were pretty much expendable, especially Pielmeier since we are face deep in goalies with Griess, Sateri, and Sexsmith waiting in the wings.<br>  <br>  As for gain, Travis Moan and Kent Huskins.  2 perfect depth players and by no coincidence, 2 more players with Cup rings.  With Grier and JR out, Moan fits in nicely.  With Huskins, he's a step above Semenov and a perfect 7th dman.  <br>  <br>  Can't say it enough, but perfectly done by Doug Wilson.<br>  <br>  BONUS - Plenty of asians here in California so how about i bring some DIM SUM?<br>  <br>  Better yet, I'll bring some exotic Shark's Fin soup.  Quite the delicacy and very expensive.  They will be served with Teal bowls and we'll watch some hockey through my HP Pavilion laptop!|`|KyCJOR2paa	Good.  There was no way a trade could make them better because of their cap issues.  It would have to have been salary for salary, so why mess with chemistry.<br>  <br>  They stayed the same.  They won a game.<br>  <br>  GO WINGS!!!<br>  <br>  Well I guess I'd have to bring an octopus, and I'll bring the Cups. ;)|`|AA12172407	LAME.<br>  Very unimpressed with most of the NHL moves yesterday. I think the Rangers and Flames scored nicelu, but my Bruins took the pill. MArk f-in Recchi? A rental player to be used specifically on power plays left wing? lame.<br>  <br>  BONUS- I'd bring some ganja|`|6vzpHTqQaa	Sabres = great!<br>  <br>  We got a backup for Lalime in Tellqvist and got Dominic Moore who is having a career year with 41 points.<br>  <br>  And all we had to give up was some draft picks!

uRqm4Bxcaa	Hey buddy.  Good question - the last thing you'd ever want to do would be to buy a counterfeit Mantle!  Here's a site that shows both a counterfeit '52 Mantle and a real, graded one.  It's mainly an issue of toning and thickness of lines on the reverse side of the card, etc.<br>  <br>  This will help:<br>  <a href="http://sportscardinfo.wordpress.com/2008/07/18/mickey-mantle-1952-topps-311-or-is-it/" rel="nofollow">http://sportscardinfo.wordpress.com/2008...</a><br>  <br>  Happy collecting.|`|GGAgxzJNaa	A reprint card will usually be identified as such, usually on the back.  Sometimes there will be obvious differences, sometimes you have to look closely.  Reprints generally have the year they were printed and the word "reprint" somewhere on them.  Reprints will also be different in size and thickness.<br>  If you have any doubts, take the card to a reputable dealer.  Cards that can't be readily identified as reprints could still be counterfeits.|`|TWol6a30aa	reprints are not worth anything.  You would need an original for it to be worth money.|`|E0LogcZyaa	Compare it with a cheaper real card from the same set. They don't usually counterfeit cheap common cards. Even if they're of different players you can look at the 2 cards side by side and if you can't see any differences in how they look- front and back, it's probably not a fake.

WiIUEObTaa	live in canada . we got stuck with finical disaster of the 2010 winter games. our armed forces, are training at this time in anti terrorist attacks. the navy is training  divers to check for bombs . the royal canadian mounted police is also going through extend anti-terriost training . the bill to the taxpayer will exceed one billion dollars for security. i believe the pound is worth i pound equals 2 and one half canada dollars . to much math for a old guy. the first to feel this economic disaster . low income families. a pound of tomatoes cost 2 and three quarter pounds . the second seniors like myself on pension who paid 20 percent of drug costs are know paying 80 percent of drug costs. due to our troops being in Afghanistan is severely depleted . the olympics have destroyed our economy. . as a first generation english parents .  RAF  pioliot world war  father. brother killed . i hope my homeland will be safe . plus the city hosting has averaged 2 gangland killings. per day. gangs terriorist . very easy accesses to sights . there will be security problems .|`|WrDGhduxaa	There is always armed security in and around the Olympic games.<br>  The security is always high, no one wants another Munich where Muslim/Palestinian terrorists murdered athletes.|`|64f1b88825b292a751bffc216f38edbaaa	Boris says he'll thump em<br>  most off the Athletes will probably be on drugs and never notice<br>  <br>  my opinion|`|c4b596d15eac948f611f72b6a99f85a0aa	Escorts?

My friend heard that they are spending about ￡600,000,000. I wouldn't be surprised after what happened to the Sri Lankan cricket team in Pakistan. There is a chance that a terrorism threat will be at the London 2012 Olympics but it's not something to be paranoid about because it's better to be safe than be sorry as they say.<br>  <br>  I don't think there will be such tight security for athletes. but most definitely the whole city particularly the Olympic Park

He would probably|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Yeah it is true loll.Like yesterday with the Bogeyman.|`|TAPBWPJLaa	In most cases, yes.<br>  <br>  Seriously, before yesterday, everyone thought Boogeyman was stale and out of place, and then suddenly people are shocked he was released? Very few people liked the Boogeyman before he was released, so why is it different when he's gone?<br>  <br>  A lot of improper names, slang terms, and abbreviations come up spelled incorrectly. The Spell Checker on Yahoo Answers is pretty flawed as is.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	lol, I still don't care about the Boogeyman. It is weird though.<br>  <br>  And everyone knows what WWE is, but I don't think it's in the dictionary. I hate how the little box on the right pops up every time I type WWE (it's detected 4 misspellings). But anyways, I think it only counts words that are in a dictionary|`|41WXZPnCaa	OMG It's True But Because Oly Release Mid Carters Or Jobbers Or Tell Me When Is WWE Going TO Fire <br>  <br>  Cena<br>  Batista<br>  Edge<br>  Jeff|`|yl86ZQ6Daa	I guess cos WWE is not actually a word in the dictionary that's why it is coming up as a misspelled word...

So...i want to see Trish in the Hall of Fame 2009|`|vbxevkodaa	She certainly should. She is probably the best woman's competitor to ever step foot in a WWE ring. Not with standing TNA's woman's division, Trish Stratus was the best.|`|cwr5mayraa	Most definitely. She's great, and I think she was at the head of the Divas division when it was at it's best|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	Yes
I1w0HfQbaa	No, I do not think she will get into the Hall. Even in the prime of her career her run at the top was from 1998-2000. That is two years, which is not very long. She made a mark for women in the sport of wrestling that they are capable of wrestling men and not be mere eye candy as a manager or valet at ringside. She should lauded for her efforts. Defeating Jeff Jarrett for the Intercontinental title in No Mercy at 1999. She was the only  woman to win a men's title which is a remarkable for a woman in a testosterone driven pseudo-sport that is pro wrestling. But her run at the top was rather brief. If there was a documentary about her career it would span about thirty minutes. <br>  <br>  If she gets inducted it sets a bad precedent: wrestlers who had a brief run at the top of the WWF pile are going to argue for induction, too. Sid Vicious was a two-time champion during the WWF "dark" days and held the title for about a month both times. Do we let him into the Hall of Fame? What about Ahmed Johnson? Or Brock Lesnar? The WWF Hall of Fame is clearly politically motivated: those who are on good terms with Vince once their careers are over will get inducted; and those who are not--Bruno Sammartino, Randy Savage--do not get inducted. But there is good reason not to let her into the Hall of Fame besides her leaving the company on bad terms: her run as a pro wrestler was kinda brief in the WWF and her resume is thin to get something as lofty as Hall of Fame induction.|`|S0u3HKzhaa	Women getting inducted into the HOF are way less common then men as it is.And Chyna does not have a good relationship with the wwe.And really without that most don't get inducted in.Prime example Macho Man Randy Savage does he deserve to be in yes but him and Vince has a fall out years ago.And unless he patches things up with Vince or Vince gets over him self he won't go in.And Chyna really won't most likely ever be inducted because of the hatred she obviously has for Stephanie McMahon in which she says she stole Triple H away from her and got her fired.And with all the drama involving Trips and Stephanie I doubt Chyna will ever go into the HOF.|`|Wf8PbTraaa	should she be inducted? yes. w/o a doubt. the first and only woman to be in the royal rumble. the first and only woman to hold the IC title. a founder of the original DX. a former womens champ. the only woman to ever be number one contender for the wwf(e) title.<br>  <br>  will she be inducted in? i don't see it. at least in the near future. and its a shame.<br>  <br>  i blame hhh and steph but others people hold others responsible.<br>  <br>  bottom line is this if half the bums that are being inducted into the HOF are being inducted in than chyna can be too.<br>  <br>  you have to remember that great era in womens wrestling that was headed by trish stratus and lita was started by chyna.|`|uS8hK7Zhaa	Definitely, if her relationship is good with the WWE<br>  <br>  But her stats and accomplishments speak for her themselves. Multiple time IC champion (first & only woman to do so). Women's champion. First and only woman so far to be # contender to the WWE Championship. First woman to compete in the Royal Rumble. She competed with men instead of women (until her neck injury).<br>  <br>  She's one of the greats, if not the best woman wrestler to hit WWE|`|OGPW7xZ2aa	i hope so i think she should she was the only woman to date to win the ic title, was in the 1999 and 2000 royal rumbles and she was in the 2000 kor so i think so should be in the wwe hof coz of that|`|iWcTmuhAaa	No, cause she had personal problems with McMahon family and she also sued the company for abusing her in sexual terms.|`|5PJl8gTaaa	She deafently diserves to be look at her career she acomplished so much that no other woman has done. But thats if the McMaBitch's will allow it!

At some point in the series, the Aussies inexperienced bowling attack will hurt them.|`|wnZ0N3wjaa	I hope we can play aggressively not defensively, let's make it 2-0 =].|`|e7f9613d5b480e9758d037bfe66ac6b9aa	no|`|cOm8LQ1Daa	Aussies will still find it dificult to defeat SA! SA still had an edge...being the hosts and 'ving defeated Aus on their home soil in the previous tour are some of the advantages they 've over Aus! It's still hard to reach a conclusion. <br>  <br>  However,Siddle's bouncer will prove vital for Aussies, if Siddle clicks again then Aussies may get another victory on SA soil!|`|Ve6KFNWcaa	It wont be that easy to beat SA this time again, though Aus will have a great chance of doing that.<br>  Siddle's bouncers have downed many South African batsmen in the first test, so no doubt he'll be aiming to do it again.|`|zoB64Ymoaa	Well so far the Aussies have made a good start. Hughes and Katich both making 100. I wouldnt doubt SA though. They are a very good side. Im hoping Australia win though. Good luck Australia!!|`|rjWRMDYUaa	S.A will come back in 2 test.
aHmrd3tiaa	The sports world is obsessed over stats, because it's a tangible measurement of performance.  In many cases, it's true.  John Carney and his field goal streak, Jerry Rice and his career TD's, etc.  But it only tells part of the story.<br>  <br>  However, it's only the tip of the iceburg.  It doesn't consider the factor of how the player's presense affect the team as a whole.  And sometimes, good stats actually point to POOR performance.<br>  <br>  For example, a CB with lots of tackles might sound good, but if he were a better CB, the receiver he's covering wouldn't have made the catch to begin with, therefor no tackle.  And if he was a REALLY good CB, the QB wouldn't even attempt to throw his way.  Interceptions is the marquee stat for CBs, and Nnamdi Asomugha only got 1 interception last year.  Because he's so good, QBs are afraid of throwing to his side of the field!  But Jason David of the Saints got 5 interceptions, because he's a weak link of their defense, and QBs pick at him all day long.  So he got lucky 5 times.|`|WrDGhduxaa	Stats are a guide to give information, but lots of intangibles determine how valuable or good a player really is.<br>  This is true in other team sports as well, a very good fielder who is not a big ball hitter is not thought to be a great player be the public in baseball, but his value to the team is important since the number of runs prevented by fielding is just as important as scoring runs.|`|XaFYUMRSaa	Winning should be..................

JThgHiaoaa	If he takes you, make sure you enroll in a lesson and tell him to go **** off without you... cause if he tries to teach you, both parties WILL get annoyed and you will not learn.

The snow is very soft in the spring and you won't get hurt by falling which you will be doing alot of.  make sure to wear waterproof suit because you will be soaked if not but there is nothing i like more then riding in the spring. snowboarding is kind of like riding a bike..commit yourself 100% and you'll be riding just fine at the begginning of next season.|`|c6JNhk85aa	I would say it doesnt hurt to go a couple times this year.  you most likely wont be able to keep up with him this year tho, so i would suggest maybe for each of you to bring a friend that will each of your seperate skill levels. that way, when he possibly gets a bit tired of teaching you and going at your pace, you can separate and just snow board with your separate friends for a little bit and both still enjoy the day.  <br>  <br>  Also, to answar the your actual question better, as i said, it wont hurt to go a couple times this year.  Over the off season, yes, you may forget some or most of what you learned, but then when you go back next season, you will pick it up much much faster then when you first learned.<br>  <br>  Hope this was of some help.  best of luck.

94C2U5FLaa	Bruins would win in 7! They just picked up Recchi and they have some veterans who have been in the playofs. Yeah the Pens are hungry from last season but i just don't think that they could pull this off!|`|Jb5itwHtaa	I don't think the Bruins would have a hard time with them at all. I think 5 games, 6 if the Pengos get a little lucky. You seem to forget, Guerin has moved around to several teams, and didn't bring much when he got there. Players don't just drop in, and start contributing. It takes time to learn the guys you are playing with. Penguins are going to dump more guys next year, and bring in new ones, and see who fits the mix. BTW, the Pens have a darn good chance of not even making the playoffs at all.|`|AA12172407	I think the Bruins would take them in a long(er) series- like 6 games. I just think the Pens are soft, their goaltending has been a concern all year, and I do not see them nearly as dominant as they were last year...totally different team.|`|0qV1YtAnaa	Bruins in 6. That's only right now though. Once they get their **** back together they can dominate the east.|`|Ag62gQfuaa	the bruins have a good team  the bruins all ways go threw a slump<br>   and really does any one know if the pens will make the playoffs|`|ltDrR2zEaa	Bruins 4-1,four balanced lines,better d and when Thomas is on he's been the best in the league so far.|`|N1OnviExaa	Boston would take it 4-1|`|8t5vPDnqaa	The Bruins would still win.
S0UuCiSpaa	I have no doubt,<br>  <br>  Pele for sure, he was the best one.<br>  <br>  For everything, he was 17 and was already a genius.|`|9b8d95d8f696f93ee3cf175a015f246eaa	Pele was one of the greatest ambassadors football has ever had as well as probably the greatest player ever. Maradonna was a whingeing, whining, fat little creep (and still is) with little talent. He had about 2 good years at the top and even then was vastly over-rated. Fell over and started crying every time anyone got near him. Nasty slimy drugged up bit of work, not even worthy to clean my boots, never mind Pele's. <br>  Dago Maradona? Pah! Not in the top 10 of all time.|`|4Td7hgqBaa	what a no brain-er this question is. Two names and only one football player, Pele. The other guy had potential,great skill and opportunity but a cheat should not be mentioned in the same sentence with footballs finest player/ambassador. For Prima dona he even blamed God for being the cheat, I spit on El Druggies boots.|`|lt8FZ6q1aa	Pele is definitely the best footballer ever. I would put Zidane before Maradona.|`|2vOg8PUzaa	Pele !!|`|XYECtMg8aa	Pele for sure !|`|EQdDkSw0aa	Pele was good because he introduced allot of skills but i'd say Maradona!<br>  <br>  That migit is great at football!|`|IWM1khX7aa	Pele is clearly the best footballer to ever live. First of all, he changed the game of football, and brought the most skill on the field. Pele is no doubt better, because he did more for Brazil and Santos (his club). Pele had more skill and speed, and no one at his time could match the level of his play. <br>  <br>  Maradona, I personally believe, is centered around two goals, his hand of god (which was cheating, by the way, and he would have got red-carded), and the greatest goal ever scored, all happening in the same game in the Quarterfinal against England. Maradona is only centered around one game (actually only 3 minutes because both goals happened in a 3 minute span). Did he score in the final against Germany? No. Everyone says he's better because he scored those 2 goals. After his career, he drunk too much and got fat. After Pele's career, he did charity work.  I don't think he'd even be in second place in my best footballers of all time. I'm not biased against him either. I think Johan Cruyff, Michel Platini, George Best, Franz Beckenbauer, and Zinedine Zidane are better than him. <br>  <br>  Everyone also forgets that Pele was 18 years old in the 1958 world cup, and that was his best performance. During his season at Santos, he had 58 goals in 38 games. Imagine someone like Bojan performing at that level. <br>  <br>  Pele was centered around every game he played unlike Maradona, whose career has been centered around 3 minutes.  Pele wasn't a cheat either. He also scored more goals than him. He has a cool and simple name too. Pele is the best footballer to live.|`|LfkHPl8Yaa	Its Pele. F*** Maradona!|`|8OAJnufAaa	Pele for sure|`|U23DRFtbaa	Pele|`|op4fEbEVaa	Pele

That makes me an irish fan extremely happy, i doubt were be doing the same against Scotland. Play your strongest team week in week out. Italy arent as easy as they seem.|`|ETarSy9Maa	Smart.<br>  <br>  Wales should kill Italy by more than 23 points anyway, but having some of your better players come on, when Italy's best players are knackered is a great advantage.|`|5963777c1326f25763b8e30c1e4286ffaa	Guess gatlands stuff about putting value into the Jersey and it not being cheapened is a pile of crap.

Ireland wouldn't, England wouldn't..<br>  <br>  Beginning to suspect Gatland and Edwards wants out of Wales.|`|Ro03hVb6aa	I think he is developing his squad depth a wee bit and resting the top guys for the Ireland game.  Only results will tell if it was a smart move.|`|34db70e0ddfd38754443083113aa81dbaa	Wales do have strength in depth and although they are going to miss their key players like Ryan Jones they should do enough to beat Italy. Its a big risk|`|98f9000f3689e28983bfec6d7a62524baa	A good move in my opinion!<br>  For many reasons!<br>  The Welsh team, in my opinion have become too predictable!<br>  <br>  It will keep dropped (though I say rested) players on their toes!<br>  <br>  The selected players run with ball in hand at the opponents, we will beat Italy at their own game!<br>  <br>  Can Alun Wyn, the line out captain,  cope with team captaincy!<br>  <br>  Bar for 3/4 players, this is the team that beat Italy 48-7 last year!<br>  <br>  If you want to develop and strengthen your squad and have the depth to remain in the top 5 in the world,  what better way to see how they preform against a weaker Italian side!<br>  <br>  Italy have not played as bad as this since they they joined the 6N's! <br>  <br>  Wales are about the only team in the 6N's that have the choice of making so many changes and still have a very strong team to field, which is why the other nations, as others have said, would never do it, they are not able too!!!<br>  <br>  I would not worry if I was you!<br>  I ain't!!!!!!!!!!
OKwp3ClZaa	I do find it very funny..... And i agree with you Jeff gordon is an amazing driver! The only reason everyone started saying that is because he was good, he was new and the kid to beat. They couldn't say that he was bad because he was clearly not so they decided to call him gay... Which he most obviously is not. He has a wife and a daughter. Not that there is anything wrong with being gay but please do remember he is not gay. Very good question it got me thinking. Thank you and have a wonderful day!|`|EHtFxGxMaa	I used to think he was a bad driver. He was taking on Dale Sr.'s attitude. He'd bump someone out of the way and say "that's racin". But if someone did it to him, WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!!!!...<br>  <br>  He has since grown up, become a good spokesman, and a lot humbler.<br>  <br>  And what's wrong with being Metro??? I get haircuts(styling) every 4 weeks, get massages, keep my fingernails clean and trimmed (including filed) and I own a nose/ear hair trimmer. AND I'M NOT AFRAID TO USE THEM.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	Yep, 'Jeff Gordon is gay' got old many years ago.  Even if he is, who really cares?!|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	they really need to move on to something else|`|qENMVe7haa	He's not gay, his boyfriend (48) is though.

I never approved of the matter, of fact manor that he used his front bumper in, early in his career..|`|gr6e1WZEaa	They don't say it because the results are hard to argue with. I have found nothing wrong with his driving ability, but of Dale Sr. fans hated him because he stole the limelight when he was winning races and championships. He has been great for the sport.
09YK9Zboaa	Stubhub is one of the better places to get tickets off of.

oojO4WAraa	Cycling is an excellent choice.  Yes, cycling (or any regular exercise) will help increase your energy and stamina.   I ride 10 miles most days.  I love it.  I only have a cheap, Toys-R-Us bike, but I am thinking about getting a better bike.  I have ridden almost 4,000 miles on my $100.00 bike - and loved every one of them.|`|aNlT1NRqaa	Bicycling is the best way to burn energy without impact. You can actually burn anywhere from 350-700 calories (depending how hard you pedal) every hour.<br>  <br>  I started riding to lose extra weight & without any specialized training (just riding), now I put on about 20 miles a day by commuting. Once you do it for a little while & just go a little faster and a little farther every time, you'll probably find you love it.<br>  <br>  Get a nice bike, a hardtail is best for roads & bike trails. Trek, Specialized, Cannondale, Gary Fisher, and Moots all make some very good mountain bikes. Mountain bikes are great around town; they can handle bumps and potholes better than a road bike and you can sit up and ride more comfortably.<br>  <br>  Buy whatever bike you get at a good bike shop. they'll help you pick one out and make any adjustments you need. Many times they will do free adjustments until it's perfect for you.|`|xxq5JAM6aa	Cycling tones/builds leg muscles, improves your cardiovascular system, enhances your immune system, helps balance your lipid levels, increases your metabolic rate, and relieves stress. Running and swimming do the same.<br>  <br>  Great balance for your other exercises. <br>  <br>  If you decide to get into cycling, you'll need to increase your cal intake considerably to compensate for what you burn. Cycling burns about 300-500 cals/hour, depending on the speed you average.|`|DOVbF4Piaa	Cycling is a great cardiovascular exercise.  You want to have a high cadence 70-90 rpm's with a lite pressure on the pedals.  That will use you slow twitch muscles that use fat as a fuel and allow you to go for a long time. Pedaling slow and mashing on the pedals will use glycogen as a fuel and will tire your legs quickly.<br>  <br>  Cycling is a great stress reliever.  You can get that runners high from endorphins.  It will reduce your resting heart rate and give your metabolism a huge boost and make you more alert.|`|MbOewCPBaa	i give you this to think about the average cyclist for example (150 pounds cyclists) will burn 35 calories an hour going 10-12 mph only and yes biking will build your energy up i ride 20 miles a day and get more energy than sleeping|`|9EXiTrciaa	.cycling is a great way to get into shape, now if you want body mass also try weight lifting along with the cycling.you can also try swimming.

That is Horrible!|`|mIdcJEJNaa	I don't suppose you've been doing this long??<br>  The racing thing, is what I'm referring to..<br>  It's a disgusting thought, and you should be ashamed of yourself..<br>  I guess it's not your fault though, it's really NASCARs doing..<br>  I even had to explain to my own kids that crashing into things is not<br>  what the drivers are trying to do.. It's expensive, and it hurts, maims,<br>  and kills people..<br>  Thanx Steffy.. I can tell you're a real fan..|`|U3ZBUOWaaa	OMG...none.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	do not want that to happen no one needs to get hurt|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	Ouch dude.  None of them I hope and pray.  You say your not asking about a driver dying so that makes it alright to ask about one being hurt bad enough that he is incapacitated for life?  <br>  <br>  What a sick, cold and heartless human being.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	Hopefully nobody, but Atlanta is one of those tracks where you see tire issues and it is the fastest track on the circuit so a hard crash is not out of the picture. If I were to guess I would say Kasey Kahne.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	It's pretty tough to assign odds to a particular driver getting injured.  The odds of any driver getting hurt badly are poor but also possible.  Lets hope for the best.|`|2kg7nWX5aa	I don't think that's going to happen , with all the great safety equipment they have in their cars.|`|SzuSqKR0aa	well hopefully none of them  there are some drivers i dont like but I dont wish them to die thats stupid.|`|scvJm4Rpaa	Thats not gonna happen.|`|e5B5ITbhaa	No one will.
CdAE4nXcaa	probably look around the corner or across the street Cali has so many mma gyms it's sick.|`|5lxTVqD6aa	wait later this year.. the ufc gym is gonna open up there.. lucky JERK!!!
XCwjsfz2aa	In my opinon, they should be fine with what they have. I can see them drafting a reciever in the late rounds (need to get that defensive backfield together 1st) You have an All Pro in Whitten, a solid #1 in Roy Williams (wasnt productive last yr i think because of the attention payed to TO), Crayton is cool, then there is Austin. So they could use a Marvin Harrison or a solid draftee @ wide out. I do believe being 3 deep @ RB will help alot. check the Giants during the super bowl year........no Shockey demanding the ball, 3 deep @ RB.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	They are still fine at WR...they have 5 receivers that can get the job done just as well as TO.  They have Roy Williams, Patrick Crayton, Miles Austin, Sam Hurd and Isaiah Stanback.  With the release of safety roy williams and TO what they need to do is find a way to strengthen their secondary|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	they cant get get Boldin or Harrison, they cant afford it.  Not unless they trade someone.  They are going to sign Demarcus Ware soon an its going to be a huge contract.  They are gonna have to have the man that cost them a playoff game (but people blame Romo for some reason?), the great Pat Crayton step up and be the man.  <br>  <br>  Pat Crayton is a joke..........<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/football/giants/2008/01/14/2008-01-14_patrick_craytons_drops_lift_giants-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/footba...</a>|`|e11Z6QfJaa	i think the real problem is jerry jones. T.O. was too much drama.<br>  all the key players really need to stay healthy and they need to stop all the finger pointing. They dropped roy williams too.|`|wd9EPcGWaa	They will have Williams as their #1,  sign the best possible free agent, and probably draft a wide out in a middle round.|`|bLC4b2NDaa	Try and get Boldin|`|ssJShV0haa	They will sign someone and make something happen.  Without TO, they will also have some other guys step up.  It's the Cowboys, they make moves and will find someone. <br>  <br>  Come to RootZoo for the best NFL answers online.

KR3IvxNwaa	they already have Moss, Randle El, and a couple of rookie WR. they are not desperate for a new WR.|`|qCr1dNspaa	The skins don't have enough money to do anything else.  They won't get a WR|`|wAiQOP0Laa	Boldin is good, but he isn't TO good.  If you said Fitzgerald, I'd say to go for him in a heartbeat.  Boldin doesn't know how to play as the 1 guy.  Teams will double him, he'll get frustrated and eventually be called overrated.  The best place for him is a co-1 spot like he has with the better half in Fitz.<br>  <br>  Ocho Cinco is good, but TO is better IMO.  Hell, I'd welcome either to the Skins.  They'd be instantly better.  Right now they have a kid with a hell of an arm in Campbell with no one who can get downfield.  Both would be an upgrade.<br>  <br>  TO is more likely though.  He seems to like the NFC East.|`|2d28d875dbd3881985c85993bc4fd134aa	if they had to choose somebody the would definitely go after Boldin.<br>  they wont get him, he stays in AZ <br>  but of course you want Boldin.<br>  the onyl time he opened his mouth was this season.<br>  he is younger. more productive.|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	I think they should go after T.O because of the motivation. He would be playing against Dallas twice a year along with playing the Eagles twice that would be the ultimate motivation.|`|daRDQE9maa	Ocho Cinco, I don't think they get Bolden I think he stays were he's at.. However I think he should pull a Michael Pittman and leave Arizona and come play with my boys in Tampa! hellz yeah that be the shiz!|`|bfeQ3miMaa	Washington offered Cincinnati two 1st round pick and one 2nd round pick for Ocho Cinco during last year's draft and Cincinnati turned it down, so I don't think they will approach them again.  I don't think that Arizona is going to give up Boldin easily, so I think their only option will be T.O. and I'm sure Snyder will overpay to get him.|`|uwms4NyDaa	They already have good WR's in the pool at the time. Harrison is a solid WR but age could be a factor down the stretch. Miles Austin may very well be a future starter for a team such as the Lions. Any of the three players you named would be a great fit in Washington. Boldin I think would be a great leader off and on the field so I believe they should go for Anquan Boldin|`|6ace2e7cff005881e0dbf8a93e1fec12aa	Owens, one thing he has shown is that he shines against conference teams, we need that edge against the NFC East,|`|cSrWQokbaa	none, they have moss, thomas and kelly they will all be amazing this year. if they go after someone is a tackle or a vetren lineman|`|MwdAePh8aa	i think they should go after owens because he still has a lot of talent and is still able to play well.
VlvektSJaa	What a waste of talent.<br>  Then again he was pretty old.<br>  <br>  Hopefully WWE gets a new creepy character.|`|WQGvE60waa	he was just there,<br>  <br>  <br>  I remeber on Tough Enogh he lied about his age,|`|KIOR56r6aa	No, TNA will go bankrupt in 6 days. He'll go to Japan|`|AA11460485	I say good riddance.  He was disgusting and not a good wrestler at all.  WWE is better off without him.  If TNA wants him, more power to them but I could die happy if I never see him again.|`|1WgOj89kaa	He never really did any wrestling did he. All he was a good personality to have in the locker room. He will be given a huge push if he goes to TNA.|`|09YK9Zboaa	He has already began booking things, I bet he will get a shot in TNA, but its good for him because there was not much of a story line for him in the WWE|`|dbc3503ab379d3f8b3803c2488ab5e36aa	he will trust me!|`|Ut7XQJ1Faa	its a shame for anyone to be released from the wwe. but i did think he was kinda disgusting and i don't think i ever saw him wrestling so it was kinda expected in my opinion.|`|vbxevkodaa	He was an older rookie, much like DDP was. WWE did what they could with him. At least he apparently has the rights to his gimmick so he can still make money in the business if he so chooses. Best wishes to the guy...|`|QB3LvbVaaa	Its good that wwe are getting rid of the useless Telnet. So they can concentrate on the people they should like<br>  <br>  ted jr<br>  <br>  cody<br>  <br>  kennedy <br>  <br>  mvp<br>  <br>  tyson kidd <br>  <br>  natyla<br>  <br>  The list gose on and on|`|Rq2BZ2Zeaa	Kind of shocked, but I bet he'll go to TNA.|`|tJEWzpb7aa	I don't think he was a great wrestler anyway.|`|x4CDslrDaa	no|`|QrbwYLaIaa	hope so|`|lt8FZ6q1aa	Unfortunately he wasn't the best of wrestlers technically. But I liked the gimmick of the boogieman, he reminded me of the deranged Mankind. I hope he does well, I would like to see him wrestle again and age does not matter, look at the undertaker, Ric Flair and Hogan.|`|2yVRuX0yaa	No im sorry guys Boogeyman is going to retire looke hes 45 or 46 years old no he will not go to TNA hes officially done. :(
YHYT8qMKaa	No, not yet. I think he got back on top of his game just because he wants to win as much as he can and because he still has the fire in him to contend for championships. I believe most sports figures would stay in their sport if they think they can still get the job done. I think that is why Brett Favre unretired last year.<br>  <br>  Jeff is the points leader right now. I don't think he would just retire when he has chances to win more championships. I suppose this could happen, but I really think Jeff will have many years of racing left in his career.<br>  <br>  I think DuPont will be gone from the sport when Gordon retires. But if they leave before that, I think someone like Pepsi will sponsor Jeff for the rest of his career.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	I think he still have the drive to have at least one more championship so I think he will be around for at least 3 more years. Dupont may leave but I have no doubt that they will find another sponsor for Jeff. He is still a big presence in Nascar and is a great promoter for his sponsors.|`|xkWLcv62aa	Gordon will end up like "Awesome" Bill Elliot. He'll "Retire" but will race every now and again. He wont offically retire ever IMO.<br>  <br>  I can see Dupont staying on, maybe Pepsi could become his major if they do leave tho.|`|IrGapExUaa	From the way he has been talking he might. I hope he does. I don't like the guy never have and never will. The bigger Question is if he does who will replace him in the #24 car. Brad K. is rumored to be driving the #5 car part time next season with Martin and then the full 2011 season.  So if Gordon does retire who replaces him in the #24 any thoughts.|`|BqmwRf1Saa	No he still has some spark and some years on his hands so it should be a while untill he is gone|`|SzuSqKR0aa	i sure hope not  I think hes still got the will and the want to drive for a little while longer....|`|1FSNlSVyaa	I hope not, Jeff Gordon was one of the best drivers when i first watched Nascar as a kid and I feel like hes still the potential of racing for the next few years, hope he win soon as well, he really needs a win, hes had a few close ones though. I reckon he'll stay on for a few more years.|`|AA11202769	yes sometime after 2010...i'm thinking 2015|`|yZUQToOdaa	I don't think so because he has the 2 other sponsers:<br>  <br>  1.Nicorette<br>  2.Pepsi
U3ZBUOWaaa	Kyle said he would be thinking on it but he won't right now. Not for a long while. Why should he? He's in the best motorsport in the world...and that would be almost taking a step down to go to F1.  <br>  Maybe when he gets older but I don't see it happening.|`|S2vI4VEXaa	Wherever he goes, my fan loyalty will follow.<br>  I wish him success in anything he does.|`|XNdDrXAzaa	Last time I gave my thoughts, I got my answer deleted. Maybe you should ask how it makes me feel. I don't think Kyle would do that. It would be like taking a step down. Although, he could switch seasons, that would be cool. It doesn't really have an impact on NASCAR anyway. Unless Kyle can win a championship. That would be cool. It's all cool.|`|ajnGHNr8aa	I thought Gordon would make this move in a few years but not so sure now. He tested Schumachers F1 Ferrari at the Brickyard a few years ago and was actually as fast or faster then Schumacher was.<br>  <br>    I am not sure if Kyles driving style suits F1. Those cars are so sensitive to steering and braking he would not be able to just let it fly like he does his stock car. It would be nice to see an American born F1 champ and I would route for him to that. (that came out of my mouth! I have to go brush my teeth now and gargle with bleach LOL)|`|mIdcJEJNaa	He would never do it, especially with a start up team...<br>  And not because the cars are so different..<br>  Except for seating, and shifting, an F1 car could be set up<br>  to feel just like what he drives now.. But why would he want to??|`|sM6d8ZgWaa	Well his smug attitude would fit in with the F1 crowd and he did win at Watkins Glen but I honestly don't think he would do well. More power to him if he gets the chance and goes for it.|`|W2R8TRDmaa	That would make me very excited.  I'm no Kyle Busch fan to say the least but I am a huge fan of America and of F1.  There hasn't been an American F1 champion since the 70's and if there is an American alive now that could do it, its him.  He'd be crazy to not go there imo.  It's the absolute pinnacle of motorsport. I see him giving a shot and at that moment, I will become a Kyle Busch fan.|`|739f14d79f8285fdffb364bed6c305feaa	I did hear him talking about it this week but as long as he is the best and tearing up everything in Sprint, Nationwide & Camping World I would bet he ain't going anywhere just yet.|`|i8soZLfRaa	Wishful thinking will get you nothing.<br>  <br>  Kyle's on too much of a hot streak in NASCAR right now.|`|D69XI2LLaa	Not gonna happen... NASCAR is where the money is. F1 is a dying sport!|`|xkWLcv62aa	No. He doesnt want surprise butt secks from Max Mossely.|`|3e1ELOgnaa	My thoughts are its his decision.|`|xTTP2Bv8aa	he already said not now so I guess its a mute point|`|DymLS3Nyaa	I don't see it happen|`|0MuRCU5paa	I am no Kyle Busch fan but he would be absolutely crazy to leave Nascar. He has a top organization behind him in Gibbs Racing, he is one of the best drivers in Nascar right now and has been the last couple of years, and he is on track to have one hell of a career. It is forseeable that he might have 1-3 championships by the time he retires. Besides, if he were to leave, who would I have to hate on Sundays? Kurt? lmao|`|LIxpXTnLaa	If he wants to try real racing then great for him. All his redneck fans will be sad but sometimes, NSACAR drivers get all curious about what it's like to drive a race car so they try and make a go at F1 or other real racing sports. Hats off to him.|`|TYc6nAUsaa	Oh, I hope so! Then he can go terrorize those guys! I don't like Kyle Busch at all, but to be honest, that WOULD be kind of cool to watch. And I hope he beats them all, although it would give the Shrub fans even more ammo.|`|p8JfOlTzaa	I think it would hurt nascar pretty bad right now.  Hate him or love him, which I don't care either way, but he's the most exciting driver to watch.  He's a very  talanted driver and I wish him the best either way he goes.  Go Mark Martin!|`|nUdTj0h0aa	I hope he does it. The sooner he leaves NASCAR for F1, the better.<br>  <br>  Sorry Kyle Busch fans. The guy needs to go some where else where he can actually compete. Seems like he has no competetion in NASCAR.<br>  <br>  Good luck Kyle!|`|4a7701071ad590528cb7c90f82d61704aa	Actually Tarzan, Gordon took Montoya's Williams around Indy a few years ago. Hey if Kyle wants to give it a try, what the hell.|`|7Qo0hcH4aa	his ears would create too much drag. they would create a parachute effect :) jk, kyle is my hero|`|7B3TwoaSaa	As much as I think Kyle is able to do the job, I also think Tony Stewart could very well do just as good at F1 as Kyle could. I think they both would make an exellent team in F1|`|GCOrku95aa	Great! More races for the other NASCAR drivers to win. Go, Kyle, DO IT!!! Leave some races for everyone else to win!|`|scvJm4Rpaa	I'm not really sure if Kyle will actually leave and go to F1 ever, but if he does, I can't say that I'm gonna miss him.|`|JfGVUh9aaa	That would be awesome! That way, he would end up in obscurity as know one care's about F1!|`|MQJdmMQTaa	Let him go so nascar would be better,without a mouthy driver|`|c16PCaCmaa	I'm pretty sure NASCAR would collapse without him.|`|ZMPvSH7uaa	catfish think Kyle will stay in nascar and catfish does not believe all that he reads.|`|qENMVe7haa	Good Riddance|`|Crzpl2fiaa	that would be the best|`|PJhwWVcMaa	I don't really like Kyle Busch but if he goes to F1 then I hope he has a lot of success. I want to see a driver from the US and a former NASCAR driver show those F1 guys how to race. Some of those F1 guys have made the jump to NASCAR and have had more trouble than they expected. I'm interested in seeing how it would work the other way around.|`|EBsFq09Haa	Could move to Formula 1|`|bnKoPExIaa	I wouldn't mind seeing him go, but it won't happen......<br>  <br>  Didn't Jeff Gordon say something bout wanting to race F1 at one point??

piZ4xDBqaa	I thought it was funny.  Seriously, how often does Shaq get a chance to flop?  I thought that Sportscenter and Van Gundy took it way too seriously.|`|AA10248312	Shaq still has it sometimes.<br>  <br>  Howard made a very quick move, but Shaq anticipated it perfectly and was in position to take the charge.  It just wasn't called (definitely a good non-call)<br>  <br>  It easily could have been called a charge if a smaller player had done exactly the same thing that Shaq did.<br>  <br>  But, as someone already said, flopping is part of the game. If you can get away with it and draw a foul, it helps your team.  Sometimes, its' worth the risk to try it now and then.   But it's tough for Shaq to convince a ref that he can be knocked around that easily lol.|`|JOC1xYJWaa	ESPN is so stupid. They had two guys going on and on about how it was the first time Shaq had ever flopped. <br>  <br>  BS! He has flopped plenty of times before. He did it when he was a Laker. Used to p1ss me off.<br>  <br>  Shaq, for his whole career, has talked out of both sides of his mouth. He puts down floppers and then does it himself.<br>  <br>  Damn, he was great for the Lakers but he makes it tough to like him (unless he doing some stupid jobberwocky dance).|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Flopping is part of the game. Basketball is not just a physical game, it's a mind game. You need to improvise, you need to use your brain not only your body in order to win.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	He was just trying to sell a foul.....I've seen Shaq take charges before, every time he "has" to flop, or the foul wouldn't be called.  Not too many ppl can knock him off his feet.|`|eypjP9Hqaa	I think nothing of it they act like this is the 1st time a player has ever flopped...I dont get what the big deal is.

His head nearly split in half, and he probably died upon impact. Worse, the person who was supposed to catch him (even though it's not his fault at all) was his brother, and his father was the referee of the match.<br>  <br>  I cannot find proof of this, but if it is true then yes at least ONE wrestler has died. Its hard to find the right article for this because most of them are in spanish, which i cant read. <br>  <br>  And of course Owen Hart died during a fall from the rafters, getting ready to be propelled down to the ring.

McDaniels went for the guy he thought was best and the guy he knew and molded himself in Cassell.  That was nothing personal.  Since that didn't happen, he shouldn't have to worry about anyone else challenging him.<br>  <br>  What he needs to worry about is his relationship with McDaniels and not alienating himself to the HC.  In most cases I would say the other way around, but they picked up this guy from NE for a reason and if McDaniels decides to pull the trigger on a Cutler trade, he'll get the ok, even if it isn't for Cassell.|`|YzROGXS1aa	no , Chris Sims is going to hold the clipboard|`|KR3IvxNwaa	yeah absolutely. he is a one season wonder.

0da6ab3c6b462dc6d34ee0177bdc0459aa	Amature only test on main big fights.  But if there are doubts in the judges they will test you anytime.  For example weed may effect your result, but the test is all about steriods and any type of chemical that is not natural in your body that will boost up your strength.  So basically don't smoke weed a week before your fight then you should be good, but for Golden glove or blue ribbon title you need to stop smoking for a least a month just incase.  The rules and regulations are super strict.

AA11570394	Coyotes are not as difficult to kill as big game are, so any of the fast .22 centerfires will work. Even the .17 HMR rimfire or .22 magnum rimfire out to 100 yards will kill them with a well placed shot. My grandson killed a few coyotes this winter with a 17 HMR bolt action rifle.<br>  <br>  So I asked the wife about this. She says she prefers the .22 hornet, .223, 7.62x39 and the 30-30 for coyotes due to the light recoil and the dead coyote with one shot. For long range the .25-06.<br>  <br>  Semi autos will kick less than the bolt actions but bolt actions are more accurate. A shorter stock is necessary for women and a proper fit is very important to be accurate and reduces felt recoil. Also the lighter the stock the more felt recoil.<br>  I have noticed when there are coyotes near our home (under 100 yards) the wife likes using the SKS with soft point bullets. But if we are out hunting them she brings a bolt action Remington 700 BDL in 25-06. And this is surprising as that rifle kicks a bit, but is a tack driver at 200 or 300 yards.<br>  Hope some of this helps.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to contact women hunters for their advice;<br>  <a href="http://www.womenhunters.com/index.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.womenhunters.com/index.shtml</a>|`|AA12034449	kinda depends on the terrain you live on.<br>  I've killed coyotes with .22 Lr, 223, 30-30 , 357 and 38 special or what ever else ended up in the truck or on the horse that day. (I live on a ranch).<br>  <br>  Women can shoot anything men can... recoil management is all about stock fit and mechanics. Get a stock with that fits, get a good cheek weld on the stock..tuck it in tight and lean into it a bit.<br>  Of course, even with correct form, big guns will smack harder than light recoiling rifles.<br>  <br>  223,243, 30-30 are all pretty mild ...as are 25-35, 218Bee, 25-20 and 32-20 but the last ones are hard to find outside of old leverguns.|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	.223 and similar calibers are used to most. Maybe 30-30 but I wouldn't use say my hunting mosin on a coyote. You could also use .357 and other magnum revolver cartidges if you could get close enough.<br>  <br>  But .223 is very managble and is effective against that kind of animal.|`|DV4xyeChaa	243...then if you want to shoot deer///you r all set....use the lightest bullet you can..if your walking with it a Remington mountain is good as is winchester featherweight and ruger youth rifles [shorter stock for smaller folks]|`|HJTs6qppaa	.22-250 is a great cartridge for anyone, flat shooting,low recoil,and devastating upon impact.|`|OYy1OmDPaa	Bolt action in .223 or .243 topped with 4.5x14x scope.|`|hoZnJVXXaa	All depends on your limits.  I know a lady that will shot any gun that a guy will and even some that some guys will not.<br>  I would suggest a 223.  That is a good round, low recoil, a vast assortment of ammo is available( most the time ).<br>  If you are really looking to make longer shots (250-300+) I would look into a 22-250 or 220 swift.<br>  If you can handle a little recoil, a 243 maybe a good all around gun, has light loads 55gr up to heavy 120gr rounds for wind bucking ability or deer and antelope.<br>  <br>  Ha, thumbs down....what was wrong here.  You non hunting Obama lovers :)|`|dVMYYnMuaa	I don't know what everyone else thinks but i just bought a 17 hmr just for coyote hunting.

QC2NozBkaa	A semi Jacketed Soft Point bullet is just what it says; a jacketed bullet with a bit of lead exposed past the shoulder near the rounded point of the bullet.  The lead is exposed to promote expansion but control it for deeper penetration as opposed to a jacketed hollow point which open immediately to limit expansion.  Jacket soft points are generally use in hunting.<br>  A Semi Wadcutter bullet has a sharp shoulder an tappers to a truncated cone.  The sharp shoulder cuts a nice, sharp, round hole which makes it a good paper target bullet.  The blunt face of the bullet also transfers energy to a soft target well and promotes some expansion along with deep penetration which some hunters use where deep penetration is desired.<br>    As to which cartridges to purchase for practice I'd pick the one that shot best in my gun.|`|ytNlz3b7aa	For target shooting the SWC is preferable. Not only are they cheaper, but they will cut a nicer hole in a paper target. The only thing you're giving up is a bit of stopping power, which you certainly don't need for targets.<br>  <br>  Go with the SWC for sure.|`|TPZwmQK9aa	Not for target shooting.  Go with the cheaper ammo...if they have it in stock.  Everything I looked up online at Cabela's in the way of bulk ammo is backordered.|`|DV4xyeChaa	wad cutters are made for target,,,theres ur answer|`|OYy1OmDPaa	The SWC has no copper jacket and will leave your barrel fouled with more lead than SJSP.|`|AA12034449	I'd go for the Semi Jacketed soft point... if you shoot a lot you will have some copper fouling... but the soft point jacketed round is a pretty good defesnive load- <br>  <br>  The wad cutters are great for target shooting... they punch a nice hole it target stock paper... shoot a lot and you will have lead fouling to clean up.<br>  <br>  Either way...you have to clean up someting... but for the money you get a 'dual purpose' load with the jacketed soft points. Magtec seems to use a clean burning powder... and all I have shot seems to very consistant and accurate.|`|mFa5ZDtcaa	For target shooting, I usually get the cheapest ammo I can find. <br>  <br>  To be honest, both will do for self defense. Some will disagree but I would ask them "Would YOU want to get shot with one?" <br>  <br>  PS. I keep Federal Hydro's in mine. Just 'cause I got some.

You're tall as are many wingers (Horgan 6'4, Rougerie 6'5, Lomu 6'5 and Banahan 6'7) and have the main attribute wingers need - pace. Speed scores tries, simple as that.<br>  <br>  Wingers also need to be good kickers of the ball - you'll find yourself returning a lot of opposition kicks to the corner.|`|M253zMU4aa	Try centre or full back.

wYGeg0QRaa	Acceleration is the motive force behind the power in a golf swing. To produce the most power the club head should be speeding up as the ball is struck and not slowing down. To get good acceleration the swing must have a very deliberate transition from the back swing to the forward swing and continue to speed up through the impact zone. A fast swing is not necessarily a swing that accelerates and could quite easily produce a weak decelerating strike. Sort of like getting hit by a truck that has it the brakes. You don't want to get hit by the same truck that has just put the pedal to to metal.|`|AYkEwqRXaa	In the downswing.  You don't take the club back fast and slow down on the down swing.  You do the opposite.  You take it back slow and accelerate on the downswing.|`|kGuJmQzSaa	the acceleration of the club striking the ball is very important. The most important thing about acceleration is that your accelerating squarely into the gold ball. acceleration right-to-left or visa versa will cause major control problems. However acceleration through the center of the ball is the most important aspect of most shots|`|jVHbDy0Zaa	Acceleration is very crucial in golf.  When you start your down-swing, it should start slow and accerlate until contact.  This is what gives you the correct flex of the shaft so your release is timed properly.

Magic Johnson made mediocre players better. He extended Kareem's career. He made an all-star out of A.C. Green. He made James Worthy a hall-of-famer. He is the most complete, team-player ever. He could play all 5 positions. He played great defense. (he even led the league in steals twice). I could go on for hours and hours...
kv4ksj1Taa	The biggest factor will probably be how well you can hit, compared to the other guys trying out, but my advice would be this....at the tryout always pay attention when the coaches are talking, don't screw around, and hustle, hustle, hustle. If its between you and a couple guys for the last spot, and they think you are the hardest worker, you'll probably make the team. Good luck.
MGawnmBAaa	It is totally normal for your legs to be aching! Always stretch after your jog, never stretch cold muscles. You should start off jogging 30 seconds walking 30 seconds for 20 minutes. Then next time jog 50 seconds walk 20 seconds and build it up. You should find it gradually gets easier and you will be able to jog non-stop for half an hour. Only jog when you feel up to it and you are determined, dont jog when your muscles ache. The more the jog, the less your muscle ache. Try not to think about feeling tired while jogging, listen to some up 'up beat get up and go' music, this will take your mind off things. Or go on different routes where you can take in the scenery. Remember, your jogging, not running, so keep it slow and calm.|`|AA12354535	Yes of course. <br>  1/2 hour is alot for someone with no experience. You need to build up your resistance slowly.<br>  Don't run again until you are feeling better or you could cause an injury. <br>  Try contrasting heat and cold on your achy muscles. It gets the blood running to that part and wipes away the lactic acid build up which is causing the pain. <br>  Stretching also helps alot, even now without doing exercise.<br>  Next time you run, stretch for 10 minutes and then run for 10 minutes and then stretch again.<br>  Do this 5 times and then build up to 15 minutes.<br>  It is fine to run for 15 minutes for a while until you get your body, heart and lungs accustomed to running for more. <br>  When you start feeling good after a run, increase to 20 minutes and on from there. <br>  <br>  Good luck. You'll love running when you've got used to it but it'll take about 3 months usually.|`|c2666c20df7b27c2859938d7ac3b140daa	It is normal for your legs to ache after your first couple of runs.<br>  <br>  One way to reduce it is to keep active afterwards - don't slump in a chair straight after but walk about a bit and even though your legs hurt the next day, keep moving about as much as you can. Walking will send blood to your legs which flushes out the toxins built up from the run and this is half of why your legs hurt. The other half of your hurting legs is your muscles complaining but go out again maybe tomorrow and try again. Take the run a bit easier as well that will help, run easy until you have been out a few times and your legs are used to running then go back up to a speed you want to run at.|`|olaj2ZwOaa	go tuesday and friday for a couple of weeks if you can run on grass its better for beginners as you now you must warm up before and after stretch those muscles and take a small bottle of water with you all the best(glad your keeping fit)|`|TC9Z548Maa	Totally normal for a beginner, this is only because your muscles aren't used to the exercise they have had. Take about 2 days off running and take it easy when you get out there.|`|CRsSw0ssaa	Stretch before you run and after you've finished, then warm down.|`|65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	This is normal the first time out, and on days that you push much harder than you're accustomed to.  Its the muscles being broken down and rebuilt stronger.<br>  <br>  I suggest 2-4 days off, there's no reason to go out and be miserable when taking a couple of extra recovery days can completely eliminate the aches.
65e0c93e39fac0974cefe1be5c93b58daa	Download the program ccleaner.exe<br>  <br>  It deletes a lot of temporary things that the internet hides in your system, slowing it down.  When you clear these things out on a regular basis, you can get a bit more speed.<br>  <br>  Also, pay attention to what category you are in.

Ct6NMwwjaa	um rose<br>  <br>  who else|`|GswnLKtQaa	it's between Mayo & D-Rose.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	Here are the candidates for the Rooike of The Year<br>  1.Derrick Rose<br>  2.Michael Beasley<br>  3.OJ Mayo<br>  4.Greg Oden<br>  5.Russel Westbrook<br>  These players put great stats and are great in the game but someone have adventige because of the team's record and someone like Westbrook fall from the race because of team's bad record<br>  And Derrick Rose should get the Rookie of the Year award|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	OJ MAYO<br>  <br>  Mayo leads the rookie class in scoring. Mayo's Player Efficiency Rating is slightly better than Rose's (his tight contender for ROY), but those of Marc Gasol and dunker extraordinaire Rudy Fernandez are better than Mayo's. Many will point to Rose's assist numbers being almost double that of Mayo's, but as ESPN's David Thorpe points out, Rose's assist ratio (the percent of his possessions that end up being an assist) is only 24.7. That's good for just 20th out of the league's 30 starting point guards, and just 42nd among all point guards in the league -- starters or otherwise.|`|KSvpLcHxaa	I think Brooke Lopez. Rose is good but Lopez is just a proficient player. He scores, he rebounds and he blocks. His numbers are very impressive. He has surpassed Kenyon Martin for most blocks by a rookie on the Nets, He has been a double double machine. He has the potentially to be a really good big man in the league. It's a shame he is never talked about and all the attention goes towards Rose and Mayo, who are both terrific players but more famous because of they are dynamic.|`|qusKbEmBaa	I would also have to go with Derrick Rose of the Chicago Bulls.<br>  OJ Mayo and Kevin Love haven't really been impressive and<br>  as good as everyone thought they would do in the NBA. But Derrick <br>  Rose who is doing great averaging 16.5 points and 6.3 assist is<br>  doing great. When Derrick Rose is hitting the 3 ball he is dangerous.<br>  I hope i helped.<br>  ( i need the points so i was wondering if you can vote me as<br>  best answer, thanks)|`|NxKjrz7xaa	um derrick rose hands down|`|9d06cffec852de9a7554521403313f02aa	Derrick Rose. easy.  He's the only rookie that's had to shoulder the responsibility of being the leader and go-to-guy of his team (Mayo has to some extent as well, but it's shared with Rudy Gay more than Rose's is shared with Gordon).  He also does more than score, with pretty high assist numbers for a rookie still learning how to run an NBA offense.  Also, the bulls are a bit better than teams like the grizzlies and the thunder, so his contributions are more meaningful.|`|0i1X8VzGaa	Derrick Rose's Bulls, and OJ Mayo's Grizzles are not even going make the playoffs.  Brook Lopez should get strong consideration for Rookie of the year.  He's been playing just as well as Rose and Mayo, and his team (Nets) are probably going to make the playoffs.

9EXiTrciaa	Try going to your local bike shop, and tell them what kind of riding you like to do,what kind of bike you are looking for , and most of how much your budget is. and the people there will help you out. there might be last year model sitting l around ,they will sell at a low price.|`|599d8c17a54be5448f4eee43cfb11b32aa	There is no "one" brand of bike that is good for everyone. The best thing to do is go to a good bike shop and ride many different brands to see what feels best. You will see that most brands that are in the same price range will actually have the same components. Shifters, levers, derailleurs etc. The biggest difference between brands is the feel of the bike when riding, this is because the geometry of the frame is what differs between brands. My personal bike just happens to be a Trek mountain hardtail|`|F37Bi5YVaa	The web address below will help you find the local mountain bike trails in your region. The link is a Google directory of mountain bike websites that list trail information. Most of the trails listed contain directions to the trail head so you know where you are going. So check it out it is pretty helpful.

Only one #16/#1 game has gone into overtime (Murray State vs. Michigan State in 1990).

IWM1khX7aa	The World Cup is much harder than the Confederations Cup.  There are more teams in the World Cup and it's more serious. If you win the World Cup, you strike gold. <br>  <br>  Sure, the Confederations Cup has all the teams that won their continental tournaments, but they don't put the best lineups in.  The world Cup lineups are more perfected and each team wants the best lineup.  Also, Greece, who won Euro 2004 (that's why I hate them so much!), were in the 2005 Confederations Cup.  They sucked and didn't even make it to the World Cup in 2006.  What kind of team is that? Portugal would have done much, much better.  <br>  <br>  World Cup is more exciting and it is more serious and it will always be the best tournament in the world.|`|Wv0UKUdiaa	WC for sure....

AA12325046	Roco, you are coming up with some interesting dream fights sir.  I consider Hagler to be one of the very best middleweights of all time going against the legendary Sam Langford who many fighters avoided for good reason as he fought anywhere from 140-200 lbs.  He had great punching power and was a very agile fighter.  Hagler was a devastating puncher and a very good boxer too so this shapes up to be a very even fight.  There's not much of a height or reach difference and at this weight, they are about equal strength.  I can see this fight going the full 15 rounds with a lot of action and momentum changes.  I think Langford wins the early part of the fight with Hagler getting his timing down by the middle rounds.  Hagler has an iron chin and it would be tested especially late in the fight when Langford nearly knocks him down, driving him into the ropes.  Hagler would recover and by the last round would have Langford reeling from some hard shots.  At the end of an exciting fight, Hagler is declared the winner by split decision with both men knowing they have been in a fight!|`|dh48AkbCaa	the langford from 1906 weighed 160, but hagler would still  take this one by close decision.
uDDsWEAraa	i think that's definetely too big for u<br>  i'm 5 8 and i use a 33/24 and i hit for power<br>  esp if ur a slapper, u don't need that much power that a heavier bat will provide u, so it's just slowing up ur swing<br>  switch to a lighter bat if ur just trying to make contact and get base hits<br>  u'll be able to get the bat around faster to hit against faster pitchers<br>  HOWEVER don't use a bat that u don't feel comfortable with bc hitting is very mental|`|QyJBl9aFaa	depends on whether you are a spray hitter or with power. Bigger bats have bigger sweet spots, thus providing a bigger area to make powerful contact.  If you are a contact hitter then that extra ounce may make a difference in your timing.  Bottom line if that if it feels good and makes you a better hitter albeit for avg or slugging, it doesnt matter what it looks like in your hands, only matters in the scorebook. Being a lefty spray hitter then try a 34/22 2 extra ounces will affect your timing, length of bat wont matter if weight is the same, thus providing that extra couple inches for margin of error when making contact with the ball.
bLC4b2NDaa	No signing Pacman Jones was|`|OElU105Gaa	Yes. I mean T.O is one of the best WR today. I mean without T.O Romo was nothing but a scrub (even now i believe thats all he is.) T.O Might have a big mouth and always causing a media circus. But so what has long has he gets the job done who cares what he does with his free time. Since they got T.O the first two years they had him they went to the playoffs. Expect the third year. Yes they might be 0-2 in the playoffs but thats to Romo choking has bad has the Cubs.<br>  <br>  So yea dumb move and i can't wait to hear the Boys' fan crying next year on how dumb the move was.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	The problem with this and the other Roy Williams being cut is the timing.<br>  wouldn't have been better to do this before the start of Free Agencey, that way it would have given the Cowboys a Shot at the Premiere Players, or atleast  they should have  to traded TO to a Cincy for Johnson yes it would have called for another trading away a draft pick but you make it for next years draft.|`|erXY47kNaa	no i think it was smart jerry jones is saving money while to is getting older and weaker. common now jerry jones knows what hes doing, hes the best owner in football and will do anything to win. T.O. just wasnt getting it done. there has been talk about him going to the raiders but i personally think hes going to new york giants|`|uwms4NyDaa	No! T.O. was a distraction in the locker room and on the field a certain times. He denied everything he was accused of and I'm not saying it was all true. But if it was the release of Owens was a smart move by America's Team|`|acaAycEXaa	No, firing Landry like he did was the dumbest move. Signing T.O. was the second dumbest. Dallas lost a lot of fans when he signed the guy who desecrated the Star.|`|cSrWQokbaa	NO if you get cancer the doctor cuts it out to stop it from spreading, this is what Jerry Jones did he cut the cancer out|`|Rez6KpoNaa	$ doesn't matter to the evilempire of football but they will NEVER replace TO ala 49ers and eagles|`|sTTzXCsgaa	No signing TO to a new contract was.|`|LvELjQ2saa	no signing T.O. was.  you know what you're getting when you get this guy.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	no|`|xhHfXuKFaa	no. he may be planning a "rebuilding" process. T.O. was a cancer. plus my raiders might sign him! we have nothing to lose!|`|bed9746a7bf18f598324f858a93ae28eaa	no|`|jn7hxEA7aa	Yes and no. Im a huge Cowboys fan...now i can see the logic in why to release TO because he has a big mouth and argues and gets into with Romo, Witten and garrett but the reality is he is a dominant reciever and to have Roy and TO lined up together along with Witten...they would have one of the best receiving game in the league|`|wxXguyK3aa	He should have traded him.|`|AA11828439	Nope, not even in the top ten.|`|pTLcvsVfaa	So whats was the problem 2 years ago when they were 13-3 and Romo was lighting up every statistic there is? Simple, TO had not blown up the team yet. Romo was playing with more confidence, without TO on him. TO seems great when a team is winning, its when struggle that he becomes an issue.<br>  <br>  Team chemistry is the Cowboys problem, even a 3rd grader knows that. TO was probably the biggest issue with tat. As a Cowboy fan, I support the move and think Roy Williams will do just fine.<br>  <br>  I find it hillarious how much people critize and owner who put together one of the best teams in NFL history, with the 90s sb teams.|`|565e59859509346cd803ff29a2a4622baa	No this move was necessary as its been necessary for every team he's been with to dump him.  You may look at it as losing 9 million, but they probably tried to shop him but no one would take him on.  If a team wanted to pick him up, they wouldn't want to give up anything of value to get him, and the Cowboys wouldn't want the players that the teams would give up for him.  He'll be a free agent and someone may go after him, but after Jerry Jones there really isn't anyone cocky enough to think they can control this lunatic.|`|RS3fjNboaa	How much longer do you think TO would have remained effective? His production was down last season and his dropped pass percentage was up. Couple that with his derisive attitude and it was not a good combination. Sometimes you have to cut your losses, and this was one of those times. It also sends a message to the rest of the team that nobody is expendable. I think it will help instill some discipline on the entire team.I think it was a good move by Jerry Jones.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	No, this was a good move by Jones.  The mistake was ever signing him in the first place.  I agree that the Cowboys have a problem at quarterback as well, I've thought so for quite some time, and Williams may never fully reach is potential.  And I believe the $9 million only effects the team's cap space for one year but I'm not sure.|`|AA11674745	I said it then, and I'll say it again. The dumbest move JJ made was signing that crackpot in the first place. Our teams' rivalry aside, you Cowboys fans will be glad he's gone as we Eagles fans are.|`|xDDNCKvlaa	I think they're gonna try and go after Anquan Boldin now. But I don't like what Jerry Jones did. If he was gonna cut him, do it before you sign him to a new 4-year deal. Dumb.|`|0TuWYaneaa	Not nearly as dumb *** signing him in the first place.|`|DymLS3Nyaa	NOPE it will make the Cowboys a better team|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	its incredibly stupid.  Its what you call "cowing to media opinion"<br>  <br>  He is only a problem when they're losing, but EVERYONE is the problem when you're losing.  its amazing how few people who are fans of football played the game at the high school level.  There are primadonnas in high school folks, coaches deal with them and you lose without em.<br>  <br>  Romo wasn't the problem either.  The problem in Dallas is the offensive line, nose tackle and defensive secondary.  They don't have a lane clogger to stop the run with the 3-4, they don't have the personnel in the secondary to stop 3-5 wr sets consistently and their offensive line couldn't block my grandma.<br>  <br>  Cowboy fans are like yankee fans, for the most part, none of you know a damn thing about football other than what the newspapers tell you.
rTCYEHQhaa	De La Rosa had 10 wins, 8 losses in 28 games pitched.  Of those 28 games, he started 23 of them.  In those games, he had an Earned Run Average of 4.92.  the other poster was slightly wrong.  ERA is the number of earned runs a pitcher allows PER NINE INNINGS.  This takes the total earned runs a pitcher gives up  and divides it by the total number of innings he pitched, then multiplies that decimal by 9. Based on ERA, De La Rosa was a slightly worse than average pitcher last year, having an ERA that was 0.32 higher than the adjusted league average.|`|tzrLDbHWaa	Well, 10-8 means he had 10 wins and 8 losses.  If you need more clarification on what a win and loss are, just ask, but I'll assume for now you know that much.<br>  <br>  4.92 ERA means his earned run average.  ERA is pretty much how many runs you allow per game..... per FULL GAME... ie 9 innings.  Granted one doesn't usually pitch a complete game, but the ERA measures how many runs you would allow, at your current pace, per 9 innings.<br>  <br>  28 games and 23 starts are self explanatory.  He pitched in 28 games, of which 23 of those he was the starting pitcher.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	He appeared in 28 games, started 23, won 10, lost 8, and allowed 4.92 earned runs per 9 innings pitched, not per outing as previously mentioned.<br>  <br>  Put it this way, a 4.92 ERA translates into roughly 1.64 earned runs allowed every 3 innings.  So if the pitcher lasted 6 innings he'd give up about 3 runs.|`|24zz6Gesaa	De La Rosa had 10 wins, 8 losses in 28 games pitched. Of those 28 games, he started 23 of them. In those games, he had an Earned Run Average of 4.92. the other poster was slightly wrong. ERA is the number of earned runs a pitcher allows PER NINE INNINGS.

Based on ERA, De La Rosa was a slightly worse than average pitcher last year, having an ERA that was 0.32 higher than the adjusted league average.|`|JDqkUzrDaa	It means that De La Rosa won 10 games and lost 8 games with a 4.92 ERA which means earned run average i think. Oh well either way. He played 28 games and started for 23 and relieved or closed for the other 5.|`|erXY47kNaa	he won 10 games and lost 8 with a earned run average of 4.92 (which means thats how much runs he normally gives up when he pitches) in 28 games.|`|L2TjmgJuaa	It means he had 10 wins and 8 loses. A pitcher gets a win when they come out of a game with the lead and the team keeps the lead for the rest of the game. A pitcher gets a loss when his team is losing when he comes out of the game and his team doesn't come back to tie the score or take the lead. A pitcher gets a no decision if they leave with the lead and their team loses the lear or if they leave the game losing and their team ties the game or goes ahead, or if the pitcher leaves the game when the score is tied. That is why there is a total of 18 wins/loses and 28 appearances. There is only one pitcher from the winning team that receives a win and only one pitcher from the losing eam that gets the loss.<br>  <br>  His Earned run average (ERA) is how many earned runs he averaged giving up per nine innings. So if he gave up 1 earn run in three innings his ERA from that appearance would be 3. <br>  <br>  28 games is how many games he pitched in and started 23 is how many games he started.
eaYtGz9gaa	As long as you protect your baby from getting too cold, there is certainly no reason why you shouldn't take him camping.  As far as the smoke is concerned, you won't want to have him sitting where the smoke is blowing in his face.  But you wouldn't put yourself in that position either.  I've been camping since I was a young baby.  I've taken my children camping their whole lives.  My pediatrician is a camper and we have shared camping/hiking stories since the babies were infants.  He has no objection/concern over sharing the outdoors with young children.  Use common sense.  Keep your baby warm and dry and out of direct smoke and you'll both have a great time.<br>  <br>  If you are interested in preparing yourself for a backpacking adventure with your family.

AA11537248	I'm with you.<br>  <br>  I've been an Eagles fan since I was a little kid.  I even stuck with them in their Doug Pedersen days.<br>  <br>  After they get eliminated at the end of the season, I will say "Football season is over." to anyone who wants to talk playoffs.  <br>  <br>  Although, I will have favorites in the postseason games, I most likely won't watch any of them.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	I have a hard time believing that you didn't watch the Super Bowl last year and cheer for one team or the other.  I've been a Falcons fan since 1991, and they've missed the playoffs many times since then, I see nothing wrong with wanting a team to win it all after your team has been eliminated from contention and I don't call that bandwagoning.  I mean come on the season doesn't end after week 17.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	I do cheer for other teams when I watch, I love football and if somebody is playing the Cowboys on Monday night I'll watch and cheer for the other team.<br>  I never get over excited about other teams than the NY Giants and NY Mets or Toronto Blue Jays but I do watch with interest and usually find myself cheering more for one or the other teams. In Football I do have secondary teams that I enjoy watching the Jets without Farve, The Steelers since they replacer Bubby Brister with Niel O'Donnell during a Game, and the Raiders<br>  <br>  But other than showing a casual interest In the Playoffs or pure hatred towards a Team I don't jump on any Bandwagons|`|AA10225723	No, I've been a Viking fan since the 68-69 season. I've endured 4 Super Bowl losses, the Love Boat fiasco, stupid trades and a team that too many times plays below par though they have the talent. But though I've been away from the state since 77 and moved to Ohio and Indy, I will always root, cheer, support, etc, etc for the purple and gold. <br>  I just know they'll come through and win it all eventually.<br>  Hopefully while I'm still young enough to enjoy it. lol|`|0b8887cb1bb770f83c9043e623f4cffcaa	hell no...i'm a 49er fan, a Sacramento Kings fan, and a San Francisco Giants fan...last time anyone of them went to the playoffs or further was 02 but neither one of them have won a title since '94 whe the 49ers won their 5th superbowl|`|RDQittNDaa	I'm the opposite...I like to cheer for the teams that are struggling so that when they do become a contender you can say you were with them through the bad times.  I HATE bandwagon fans.|`|5B6w8mxVaa	No I have been a Cowboys fan for 16 years and my whole family are  Cowboys fans.I just cant imagine not rooting for the Cowboys.<br>  Im getting tired of these Patriots fans jump to Steelers and then back.|`|eypjP9Hqaa	I'm a Raider fan in the Nfl and A trailblazer fan in the Nba...Heck no I'm not a bandwagoner.|`|cSrWQokbaa	Nope, I have always been a Penn State, & a Redskins fan, even though my teams have some National Championships and Super Bowl rings, It always seems like no matter what we just play like crap, Why would I stray, there are my team no matter what, win or lose I'm a fan|`|dD41xKb0aa	ok ok dang you caught me i admit it i have jumped on bandwagons since the beginning of my time|`|xhHfXuKFaa	lol! im a raiders fan....why would i jump on the most dysfunctional teams bandwagon?|`|ZWkX43zMaa	Ever since I was old enough to understand sports [9 years old in 2002], I've always liked the:<br>  NFL - New Orleans Saints<br>  NBA - Phoenix Suns<br>  MLB - New York Yankees<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  My 2 cents.|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	I think most people do.  I have been a Lakers fan since age 9 when I was old enough to understand sports. I am 32 now. Howeverrrrrrrr, there is a reason I became a fan of my teams.  I became a Cowboys fan when they were horrible though, I do know that.   I grew up near Pittsburgh, still live here.  I was mentally abused as a kid by my dad who I dont talk to at all to this day.  He was a Steelers and Celtics fan.  He used to tell me how bad everyone hated the Cowboys in our area and how he used to hate them.  I did what was natural and became a fan of the teams he hated the most.  I guess you could say I jumped the Lakers wagon because they were very good back then, but I only started to like them because my dad hated them so much.  Ive been a die hard fan of all my teams since I was old enough to watch sports.|`|632BbbUtaa	ive been an eagles fan as long as i can remember. but i live in san diego and believe i have had to deal with my fair share of bandwagon fans here. and im not one of em. i hate the chargers.|`|8eeee84248737295c60d88565ceb0559aa	Never.  <br>  <br>  I'm a 49'er fan, Texas Rangers fan and Mavs Fan. <br>  <br>  0 titles in 15 years all the way around and what, 5-7 playoff appearances combined in the last 10 years|`|AA11828439	Never, but I do root for teams other than my fave.

tgZXvSv2aa	You silly ATLien.  Lakers Fan Boys don't understand the importance of field goal percentage.  Why on earth would you think they'd give credit where credit is due?|`|wd7XuvKnaa	Lol (kids these days).<br>  <br>  Wrong, if you watched any Laker games in the past 3 years then you would know Kobe's Shot Selection is HORRIBLE. Kobe just jacks up 3-pointers when his team is down, thats one of his major flaws.<br>  <br>  Kobe is a Better Pure shooter than Lebron, but his shot selection is bad thats why his 3-point % is so low.<br>  <br>  If you had to choose to let either Lebron or Kobe attempt a 3-point GW shot...who would it be?? I'm guessing Kobe right?|`|tKuzreMsaa	Lebron's a beast!  He can do anything he puts his mind to.  When his shot gets going, it's unstoppable.  I saw him live a few weeks ago and he just didn't miss.

EVEN COMPARED TO KOBE!!!|`|GBGcI509aa	Well LBJ is gradualy improving.|`|WLXFAeSnaa	I never got why people called LeBron LeBrick.<br>  <br>  But thank you for pointing that out!<br>  <br>  Star for you :)|`|csKyqot0aa	Cool.

1nJFqRceaa	hey there, i am an advid collector of fishing equipment.  i have found rods that are completely wood but they were not considered antiques but yes it would be considered vintage.  about 20-30 years ago the manufactures of rods found that graphite and fiberglass was alot more durable and stronger than wood so they started adding in graphite and fiberglass to the wood.  it was only about 15 years ago did they start building completely fiberglass rods.  so after i said all this yes you have a vintage rod.  i would see if there were any markings on it as by the maker and model look it up and you just might have you a good collectible if not an antique.  good luck good fishin be safe and remember to share the experience|`|nkHWAhvzaa	THOSE ARE CALLED STICKS|`|q8dX0MsNaa	they quit making fishing rods of lemonwood and yew many years ago.<br>  but they do still make them of bamboo strips which do look like wood.<br>  also, any kid can go down to the creek and cut himself a sapling (wood) and use that.<br>  <br>  *note<br>  they've been building fiberglass rods since the 40s.<br>  <br>  they've been using graphite since the 70s.|`|113f96e86c976547fe006e5fe6d83fabaa	A fishing rod/pole with a wooden shaft would seem to be quite old, as you assume.<br>  However, this does not mean it is of any great monetary value.

3yvuMkzTaa	When there is no one on base, keep it behind your back. When a runner is on, make a fist & put it on the back of the pocket of your glove!!!|`|s4VzPulYaa	Either way, it just matters what is more comfortable for you, what is more comfortable should be more safe for you.|`|cxyLCoYraa	Behind your back of course|`|2N6oTOLQaa	The bottom line is it needs to be protected against foul balls. Don't worry about your arm. If a foul ball hits you in the arm it will sting but it won't do any damage. <br>  <br>  I suggest you keep your throwing hand behind your back or tucked behind your leg. <br>  <br>  The danger in keeping it behind your glove is that most catchers who start here end up moving their glove to catch the ball but not moving their throwing hand with it. If you watched yourself closely on video you'd see that as the pitch comes in, you move your glove out from in front of your hand leaving your throwing hand exposed to foul balls.

OAEuYZkZaa	To answer the last question first, a gun crank always needs one more gun, always one more.<br>  <br>  At a minimum, a hunter needs a good .22 LR rifle, a good .22 revolver (or pistol), at least one shotgun in 12 gauge ( having a 20 and a 28 gauge will also be useful) and at least one good medium bore centerfire rifle, a muzzle-loading rifle and a large bore revolver.<br>  <br>  IMO, the very best .22 LR rifle for the small game hunter is the Marlin Model 39.  It has been in constant production (under various model names) since 1903.  They are much more accurate than you'd expect from a medium priced lever-action rifle and highly dependable.<br>  <br>  For the small game hunting handgun it would be very difficult to beat a Ruger Single-Six Magnum.  It has both a .22 LR cylinder and a .22 WMR cylinder.  IMO the 5.5" barreled model is a very good choice.  It has a barrel long enough for a good sight plane and it is short enough you can sit comfortably with it on your belt.  If you prefer semi-autos, Ruger also offers a good line of adjustable sighted .22 semi-automatics, you should have no trouble finding one to suit your fancy.<br>  <br>  In shotguns, I like a double for hunting, but since it is hard to find a good one at a reasonable price pump shotguns are more popular.  I recommend the Mossberg Model 500 in 12 gauge.  You can get a two barrel combo with a 26" screw-in chokes and an 18.5" cylinder bored barrel for things that go bump in the night.  I've owned Mossberg shotguns for well over 30 years with total satisfaction.  I know that new model semi-autos are more reliable than those of the 1960's aND 1970' s but they are still much more ammo sensitive than pumps or doubles.  I recommend the 12 gauge since it is more versatile than the 20 gauge, there is nothing that a 20 gauge shotgun can do that a 12 guage won't do better.<br>  <br>  When it comes to picking a rifle opinions become pretty fiercely divided.  I like lever-actions better than bolt-actions and I like single-shots better than semi-automatics.  I would recommend either a lever-action or a bolt-action.  if you hunting area rarely offers shots beyond 150 yards, a Marlin Model 336 in either .30-30 WDF or .35 Remington will serve you well.  If longer shots are common a good bolt-action from Winchester, Savage, Remington, or Ruger chambered in .208 Win or .30-'06 would be just the ticket.  If you are as fond of leverguns as I am, you should take a good look at Browning's BLR.  It is a lever-action with a box magazine to permit use of pointed bullets.  In addition to the .308 Win and .30-'06, BLR's are chambered in .300 WinMag, and my favorite medium bore cartridge, the .358 Win.  If you are thinking about really long shots, learn to stalk close enough you won't need to make long shots on game.<br>  <br>  For a big game hunting handgun you'd be hard pressed to do as well as you would with a Ruger Super Blackhawk or Super Redhawk in .44 RemMag.  With the right load and a good shooter there is nothing that can't be taken with a .44 RemMag.  Other than the Desert Eagle, chambered in .44 RemMag or .50 AE, there are no semi-automatics readily available that are suitable for hunting.<br>  <br>  For a big game muzzle-loader I would recommend nothing smaller than a .30 caliber rifle, and I consider the .54 caliber rifles to be the best compromise between the higher velocity of the .45 and .50 caliber rifles and the heavy bullets of the .577's and .58 calibers.  I use a Thompson Center Renegade in .54 caliber and I consider them to be among the best on the market though they lack the polished brass fittings of the Hawken style rifles.  I positively detest the modern in-line muzzle-loaders and won't even discuss them.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of different types and calibers that a serious hunter will need to fill all the niches for different types and styles of hunting.  But the battery I described will handle the majority of any hunter's needs.<br>  <br>  Doc|`|QrjuueMCaa	I've thought about this question a few times, and like many others, believe this is a highly 'watched' forum.<br>  <br>  I would have to say, I used to have quite a supply, but I sold them all to a guy named Jim and he just died and has no family or friends.|`|nooi0ldjaa	turn the caps lock off bro. my eye sight ain't that bad yet.<br>  <br>  i have, a 30-06, .270, .22, 20 gauge shotgun, 2x 12 gauge shotguns, 2x 30-30.<br>  <br>  that's enough for me to take down anything in north America. but that doesn't mean im done buying ;)<br>  <br>  and for the 2 legged my mother carrys a .38 special|`|6pUzzsuhaa	each rifle caliber has certain usages- so it all depends on what you'll be shooting/hunting <br>  some are better for deer others are better for other critters, but there are quite a few calibers that can take down the same game<br>  <br>  <br>  i own a 20 ga semi-auto and a 243 bolt action- all ammo and the two guns are in my room <br>  <br>  total in the house there's a 44 mag., a .22 bolt action, a 308, two 12 ga pumps, my grandpa's WWII rifle, and another handgun somewhere in the house<br>  <br>  each gun in 'my' house has a different use- the 44 is for home protection and has snake shot for snakes, the 22 is for rabbits, squirrels, and armadillos, the 12 ga's are for trap shooting, turkey hunting, and rabbits, the 308 is for deer, my 20 ga is for snakes, squirrel, rabbit, doves, bobwhite, trap shooting and other "critter patrol" and my 243 is for deer and coyotes<br>  <br>  <br>  and how many rifles for hunting- again, it depends on what your gonna be hunting- a 'different tool for a different job'|`|JSGLKnA4aa	need depends on what type of game he's into. .270 for med-lrg game. 12ga for bird. 22wmr for rodents etc. i also take advantage of muzzleloader season also.|`|fB8ujUVNaa	.22lr<br>  .17hmr<br>  .308<br>  30.06<br>  12guage<br>  is that all?|`|OmKtUijpaa	I have a Stevenson 22-250, i was going to buy a savage but why spend the extra two hundred dollars on the same gun, but just different color.

My first shotgun ever is some Mossberg knock off twelve gauge. I think it only cost like a buck fifty brand new, but hell i killed doves, geese, ducks, anything with else with it so whatever, it worked as far as I'm concerned. And i just finally went out and decided to drop some money on an 870 it's a beautiful gun. It's the mossy oak duck blind one and i really didn't want to spend the extra money just because of the camo, but I'm glad i did. If i was a beginning hunter i would definitely go buy one just make sure it's the super mag if you're going to be out hunting geese and stuff. There probably the most reliable guns out there. I plan on this summer going out and buying another 870 but with a slug barrel on it.

8aLI3n1Xaa	yeah I have Asics and they still work. You can purchase a little object holder in a store somewhere that holds the sensor in place. There are two holes on the object that you put your shoe laces through on your shoe and then you tie your shoe and the sensor should stay there when you run. Make sure that the sensor is securely held in the object, though. There may be other holders that are different, also. So, any shoe will work if you have some sort of holder that holds the sensor securely to your shoe.

That will get you just about neutral and a pike with legs out of the water will start you down such that once you're down 5 feet or so, the suit's compression will be enough to keep you down comfortably with little effort.<br>   Now...the kicker is what your rig configuration is. Little things like jacket style BC or alum tanks can make a difference here too. That's why you should start light and trial and error it for a few minutes before you plan on your dive. Once you have that number for that particular set up, remember it. It'll only change if you change gear or if you go back and forth bewteen fresh and salt water.|`|92df82e95b3b1086d69d36994ca2effdaa	Leaving you out of the equation for a moment, the wetsuit will probably take 12 or so pounds to offset it's buoyancy - depending on how old or new and how quickly it saturates.  You need to offset your gear - depends on what you are diving.  Maybe 2 lbs.  Aluminum 80 tank?  Are you diving a jacket BC or a back plate?<br>  <br>  How about you - 6"1 200 seems not too pudgey, you may be 2-4 lbs.<br>  <br>  How experienced a diver are you? - If you are asking the question in the first place, that probably means you haven't done that much diving.  So you will tend to weight a little heavier to feel normal.  (helps you get down / stay down at the end of a dive.)<br>  <br>  Also a consideration is how deep you will be diving.  If you are going more than 66ft. You will get some heavy wetsuit compression.  In that case with a 7mm, you want to not go quite as heavy (which will make it a bit harder to get down the first 10-20 feet - but you won't be a stone on the bottom. - and you need to be able to swim the gear up at the end of a dive.)<br>  <br>  Lastly - fresh or salt water?  If you are diving salt, you will need to add a few to overcome the difference.<br>  <br>  I am guessing all and all you will be in the neighborhood of 16 - 20 pounds, but you can see that there are a few factors.  --- Take my advice as general guidance and not what to use.  Ask a local Divemaster or Instructor who can look at you, your experience level, and your gear and give you a better idea.  -  Do a short test to 10 feet and make adjustments before going on a full dive.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|cd1b2cd9110fd18b756c043955cc66e2aa	Are you wearing a wetsuit?

eedbc9e134db1a07185f9cca66280063aa	As a Cowboy fan I'd like to see Williams gone but not to Houston. I'd hate for y'all to find out the hard way (like the Cowboys did) that he's not good enough to play safety and he's not big enough to play linebacker. I wished he had worked out but you're right, that guy will light up ANYONE, when he stays in position.|`|jwm0kQvNaa	for a safety, he'd make a pretty good backup LB.|`|KR3IvxNwaa	they will get a safety this season but it won't be Roy Williams. i think they will get a safety from the draft.|`|PMluTf72aa	Williams is an excellent safety when it comes to defending the run.  However, he has terrible coverage skills.  I expect him to sign with a team that has a 3-4 defense.  I have a hunch he'll go to either Denver or Cleveland.|`|7RziqsDcaa	Did you have fun jumping off the Cowboys bandwagon?|`|5B6w8mxVaa	he has lost his step and is out.|`|acaAycEXaa	Yes, or K.C.

pTLcvsVfaa	Roy Williams and Patrick Crayton could be a good combo. Along with Hurd. Roy Willaims is a star reciever, I honestly dont think they need Holt.<br>  <br>  I think they should be looking to speng money on corner backs and saftey. Newman cant stay healthy it seems. Not to mention that paper thin offensive line.|`|jn7hxEA7aa	No...we don't really need another receiver we still have Austin, Stanback, Crayton, Sam hurd and Roy Williams.  Then need to look at getting Julius Peppers which is unlikely or trying to find a way to stregnthen their secondary|`|KsoUiryAaa	It would be great to watch Holt in Dallas teaming up with Roy Williams, but I really dont think that they will try to get him.

I think with his addition their offense would be as productive as it was in 2007. Holt is younger than T.O. and the only reason his #'s weren't so great last year is because he played for the suckage that was the Rams!|`|24rqwGRFaa	Maybe Dallas should bring back Danny Amendola again!<br>  <br>  C 'mon. Look at Arizona and Pittsburgh. It shows what having an above average QB, and two legit receivers, gets you. We WAY overrate Crayton and Hurd. They are #3 receivers at best. Holt would be rejuvenated being on a team that isn't circling the drain, and would compliment Williams who I'm not convinced is a real threat as a #1 receiver (and I went to UT). <br>  <br>  TO was a royal pain, but he was stinkin' good. We need to replace him with someone else who's stinking good, and not rely on the Hurds and Craytons of the world to get us a darn playoff win.
AA10248312	"shewantsrevenge" is correct.<br>  <br>  Wilt coached in the ABA, but never in the NBA.<br>  <br>  Baylor coached the Jazz when they were in New Orleans, prior to moving to Utah<br>  <br>  Cleamons coached in Dallas for a little more than a season<br>  <br>  Pat Riley, of course<br>  <br>  Jerry West coached the Lakers for 3 seasons<br>  <br>  That's it.<br>  <br>  <br>  West left the bench after the 1978-79 season, and was replaced by Jack McKinney.  The Lakers drafted a guy named Magic that summer, and the rest is history.  McKinney was almost killed in a freak bicycle accident, and was replaced by Paul Westhead, who directed the Lakers to a title in Magic's rookie year.|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Jimmy Cleamons<br>  Pat Riley<br>  Elgin Baylor<br>  Jerry West|`|50PfC3OIaa	Jimmy Cleamons<br>  Pat Riley<br>  Elgin Baylor<br>  Jerry West<br>  <br>  I think thats it.
AA10248312	That's difficult to answer.<br>  <br>  Mikan kept the NBA in business during his career..people paid to see him play.  Without him, survival of the NBA would have been much more difficult.<br>  <br>  Wilt was the most dominant player in history. He had his problems when he got to the Lakers, mostly a season long feud with coach Butch van Breda Kolff during the 1968-69 season (Bill Russell's last year in the NBA).  Wilt did lead the Lakers to the finals in four of the five years he played with them in LA  (1969, 70, 72 and 73).  He gave up scoring to concentrate on defense and rebounding when he got to the Lakers (but would sometimes score 50 or 60 in a game just to show that he could still do it). He was all-world defensively and led the NBA in rebounding every year except 1970, when he was injured and missed 70 games, but came back for the playoffs and led them to the finals against the Knicks.  The knee injury suffered by Wilt would have ended the careers of almost any other player, especially in that era of primitive surgeries, but Wilt was an incredible athlete.  Wilt retired while he was sitll a star in the league, having led the NBA in rebounding at the age of 36 in 1973.<br>  <br>  Kareem probably meant the most to the franchise because of his period of sustained excellence.  He won 3 MVP awards with the Lakers, and led them to 5 titles in the 1980s, going against and dominating the greatest front line in NBA history, the Parrish/McHale/Bird front line of the Celtics.  His skyhook was the absolute greatest shot ever, no exceptions and, unlike Shaq, you didn't have to bench him in the 4th quarter of games due to poor foul shooting.  Kareem could hit the clutch FT when he needed to.  When the Lakers became the first team in 19 years to win back-to-back titles in 1988, Kareem was the reason they won game 6 to force a game 7.  With the Pistons up by a point (and they held a 3-2 series lead) he made a key defensive block on one end, and came back to hit two FTs with a few seconds left with Detroit up by a point. That won game 6, James Worthy took care of game 7.<br>  <br>  Shaq merely continued the tradition of great L.A. centers, but he really didn't mean as much to the franchise as Kareem did.. the three peat was great, but Kareem went against far superior competition in the finals than Shaq did.   Kareem was a different type of player, he relied more on finesse, quickness and skill than on simple brute force and dunking. <br>  <br>  All of these guys were very important to the Laker franchise.  I would probably rate them   1) Kareem   2) Mikan    3) Wilt    4) Shaq in terms of their importance in the history of the franchise.   Wilt was the only one of the four who did not play for the Lakers when he was truly in his "prime", although he was still a major star and dominant force in the league right up to the day he retired.<br>  <br>  That's an excellent question btw.  These guys represented four of the five most prominent centers in NBA history, with Bill Russell being the 5th.|`|kFcdwVwdaa	she wants revenge you are wrong, mikan didn't revolutionize the game, it was because of William "Bill" Russel and Wilt "the Stilt" Chamberlain that the game changed and expanded the free throw line. they would get 50 rebounds a game because the inside was so small they didn't have to worry about 3 seconds or anything. another rule that came in because of them. so because he revolutinized the game i would say Wilt of the Lakers organization, but hepled the Lakers organization out the most was Kareem, he was unstoppable in the inside and learned from one of the best centers in the world.|`|vFbzBo4eaa	They're all great players and they have done a lot of good things for the Lakers<br>  But if you mean who means more from centres then it's between Shag and Kareem.Both of these guys are great players.Shag won  i think 2 or 3 in a row with the Lakers and has a total of 3 rings with the Lakers<br>  I think Kareem has 3 or more in the 80's and he has done the same thing with Shag.They both have ring with other team Shag with the Heat(2006-2007) and Kareem with the Bucks.They're the most frachise centeres for the Lakers and in all time|`|reIMLCKkaa	Kareem because of the amount of time he played and because he has help with the franchise as an ast coach. He has been involved and will remain with LA since 1975. He even attended UCLA, he was drafted by the Bucks but always wanted to be a Lakers. We are forever in debt to him for our sucess. Like Magic, and hopefully Kobe, He has bled LA blood forever... Shaq left and became involved with other teams.|`|zg1lIy7Oaa	Wilt Chamberlain gave LA Lakers their NBA Championship on 1972 together with Elgin Baylor and Jerry West.<br>  <br>  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar gave LA Lakers their 5 NBA Championship on 1980, 1982, 1985, 1987, 1988 together with Magic Johnson and James Worthy.<br>  <br>  Shaquille O'Neal gave LA Lakers their 3 consecutive NBA Championship on 2000, 2001, 2002 together with Kobe Bryant.<br>  <br>  Kareem Abdul-Jabbar is leading in contributing NBA Championships for LA Lakers and next is Shaquille O'Neal, the thing is that he doesn't have any other competition in the middle except for Robert Parish. If we are going to put Shaq in the 80's and Jabbar here today, it is pretty obvious that The Big Diesel won't have any match on that time. He will completely dominate the paint and can be an NBA Champion as long as he is playing (before Jordan's era, of course) and Jabbar will be a common slow center today versus other centers (Yao Ming, Dwight Howard, Tim Duncan, etc.)|`|50PfC3OIaa	I'll say Mikan. Yes Kareem won more, Wilt scored more, and O'Neal dunked more. But Mikan was the NBA's first superstar. It's first headliner and crowd draw. Without him maybe the modern day NBA wouldn't exist. Because of Mikan several rule changes in the NBA the 24 shot clock was introduced, as was the wider foul lane.<br>  <br>  to: Lakers_all the_way_49-12<br>  <br>  24 second shot clock was introduced in 1954.<br>  <br>  Widened the foul lane before the 1951–52 season in an attempt to slow down George Mikan.<br>  <br>  Russel was drafted in 1956 and didn't play until December of 1956.<br>  <br>  Wilt was drafted in 1959.<br>  <br>  Both AFTER the rule changes.<br>  <br>  So. What was that again about Bill and Wilt?|`|dsmKLAQWaa	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar. The NBA was full of legends and the talent pool evened out. When the Lakers was confronted with any team in the NBA they would always face tough competition.<br>    Once Magic joined the team they were almost unstoppable. The Lakers went on the become the most dominate team of the 80's capturing 5 championships.|`|7bx2XQlqaa	Wilt.  Transended the game of basketball.  Transended the Center position.  He has not only  meant the most to the Laker organization, but he has meant a great deal to the NBA and the game of basketball in general.  He is true legend.|`|FtkoBEVpaa	Kareem's legacy is far greater in LA is far greater than that of the others.  The franchise wouldn't be what it is today is it weren't for the run and gun Lakers of the 80s.|`|NmXKPDoIaa	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar: Just look at what he did in the 80's for the Lakers. 5 titles and 8 finals...The Lakers dominated the 80's.|`|aSE076PZaa	Kareem Abdul-Jabbar<br>  he was unselfish<br>  hardworking<br>  and his muslim 2|`|xRPjgGs1aa	Kareem's|`|GswnLKtQaa	all of them, they have done alot of contribution to the lakers franchise, but if I had to pick one it's Kareem because he helped the Lakers alot during the 80's|`|KdhNCnEjaa	George Mikan, because he spent all of his career but 1 year with the Lakers, while Wilt, Kareem, and Shaq, all played for other teams and had success with those teams.
PRx6j6YQaa	he is trying to figure the slope of the green|`|jwm0kQvNaa	Not much, since it's one of the biggest wastes of time.  <br>  <br>  Most people read the green with both eyes, since it makes a clearer picture in your mind.  That's assuming you're on a level lie, not inadvertantly tilting your head, actually using your dominate eye, and holding the putter perfectly still.  Most golfers only use the plum-bob to verify if it's a right or left break.  Besides, if you focus too much on the break and not the speed, you'll still miss it anyway.  <br>  <br>  Ben Crenshaw is credited with being one of (if not) the best putters ever.  He only used a plum-bob as a "Go!" signal in his mind.  Read the break and speed, plum-bob, set up and putt.  <br>  <br>  Putting's hard enough as it is- don't make it worse with inefficient methods.  Trust your eyes, instincts and stroke- that'll take you farther.|`|d44d8834433f98c3a93f35f420d4a381aa	You get instant feedback regarding the break. You just need to know how to interpret what you see.|`|prahKrpjaa	Agree with the other poster.<br>  <br>  The IDEA is that one can tell the slope of the green, but it's a myth.  AT BEST, one MIGHT be able to tell the slope right at the cup, providing 1) the cup is cut squarely into the turf, 2) the putter actually hangs like a true plumb.<br>  <br>  #1 probably isn't a problem, but with the putters today and their odd shapes, they aren't going to hang straight down.<br>  <br>  Golfers, especially pros, aren't known for their knowledge of physics (amazingly).... just listening to Johnny Miller a couple of times will tell you that, and he's paid to talk.|`|kGuJmQzSaa	it impossible, if someone told you they were plumb-bobbing, they are full of crap|`|fmxjWn4Daa	When he/she cannot read the break.

It would really be the retirement match."<br>  <br>  A 17-inch (43 cm) rod was placed in his leg during the two-hour surgery. For a while he used a cane to walk. Sid later sued WCW claiming that he was made to jump off the middle rope against his objections.<br>  <br>  The injury forced a plot change in the 2001 SuperBrawl Revenge event.

His work in the ring is sub-par at best and never seems to have any good matches.  Did you see his most recent string of matches against Kozlov and JBL.  Those matches sucked, and there is one common thing about them, that would be HBK.  HBK sucks and needs to retire, pronto.  Hogan needs to come back and face HBK again, because he absolutely killed him during that match and i would love to see it again.|`|iWcTmuhAaa	In this match Shawn Michaels was much, much, much better then Hulk Hogan ever was in his whole carer.

I'm sorry, I couldn't stop laughing after that last answer.  HBK's wrestling is sub-par???  Hogan genuinely destroyed him?  Hogan should get all the credit for what he did for wrestling in the 80's and in WCW in the mid 90's.  What he lacks in actual wrestling ability he made up for in showmanship.  The fact that he got people off their seats with a body slam and a leg drop is saying something.  However, HBK has made more wrestlers look good in losing, the just about any wrestler. I personally think HBK "oversold" on purpose to make it look ridiculous.  HBK has put on more 5 star matches than I can remember.|`|aSE076PZaa	yoo man its true.hbk did oversell hogan.go watch the match on youtube.whenever hogan hit hbk, hbk jumped like 20feet back or out the ring,he made hogan look 2 good.hbk hit him with a chair.with a superkick and he still got up..watch the end of the match.when hogan gave him the big boot b4 the leg drop.hbk got back up and went round and round. like a bird b4 he came back down..honesty hogan suxs now.and he needs other guys 2 look better. like randy orton did,brock lesner did..

0P71zlECaa	A very interesting question. <br>  <br>  Owens will eventually be inducted into the HOF even if he never puts on the pads again. But I think he'll be signed somewhere and have 2 or 3 more years to add to his stats.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure about all the HOF rules for induction and whether or not a player has to have a designated team. I know some players that finished their careers with a different team than where they became stars have signed a one day contract with a former team, so they could retire as a member of that team. Joe Montana and Emmit Smith are examples.<br>  <br>  Owens played 8 years for the 49'ers, 2 for the Eagles, and 3 for the Cowboys, He had similar stats for all 3 teams. Because of the 8 years with SF, my first thought was that he'd retire as a 49'er.<br>  <br>  However, Owen's playing days with SF seems like ancient history now. I'm thinking that none of the 3 teams will be all that excited about having him retire as a member of their team.<br>  <br>  Time has a way of healing wounds, so we don't know what the attitudes will be like 4 or 5 years from now. So, unless Owens plays 2 or 3 years for a 4th team and is successful and maybe wins a SB, the team which he ends up going into the HOF as a member of is anyone's guess at this point.<br>  <br>  My particular guess is that Owens will retire as a Cowboy. <br>  <br>  A lot will depend on what is said over the next few days and weeks and how Jerry Jones and Owens handle the situation. Jones will seek the spotlight and publicity that Owens retiring as a Cowboy will bring.<br>  <br>  I'd list the odds of which team in this order: <br>  <br>  1. Cowboys - makes peace with Jerry Jones and cries during the HOF ceremony. <br>  2. 4th team - if he has a couple of good years and retires under his own terms.  <br>  3. 49'ers - who is TO? and why do we care? But the 49'ers will probably need something to celebrate.<br>  4. Eagles - not even if hell freezes over and pigs fly.|`|HAZAQ3UBaa	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha... of Fame...you're hilarious...hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha...|`|6c4fe073c2be44acf5780885ed218152aa	I'll say the "I DIDN'T WIN A SUPER BOWL TEAM"|`|TGrObqWzaa	i hope seattle sea hawks they need him the most|`|0f5cc27a5aca75cf6162b2cbb88fc13caa	Id say San Fran|`|AA11828439	I don't think he will ever make it in.|`|479182125f393fcf9723202d1fa6b1dbaa	He spent most of his time and scored most of his touchdowns with the niners.

To lay that all on TO is bull **** and I'm a 49er fan.<br>  <br>  With the eagles they made him sign a waiver voiding his contract if he reinjured his leg in the super bowl, proving that they were more concerned with money than with winning.  IN the off-season he wanted a new deal and they said no.  So he did what he did.  Neither party there can claim sainthood.<br>  <br>  With the Cowboys TO wasn't a problem unless they lost and then everyone piled on.  <br>  <br>  TO, for all his antics, has never been in trouble with the law, plays hard, blocks well and makes big plays.  Hell, Marvin Harrison gets in a fist fight with a guy who coincedentally winds up shot with Harrison's own shotgun and nobody cares.  I don't understand how the same media that runs to him for quotes is also the media that bashes him for his quotes.  Talk about hypocrites.<br>  <br>  I hope he goes in as a 49er and I would love it if the 49'ers bring him back.

The big selling point for BJJ is that you go full speed 99% of the time (except, when learning a new technique, you go slow to make sure your technique is correct). You get a great ab workout too. <br>  <br>  Muy Thai is great too, and I get to do that as well since my academy offers both but I do BJJ 4 days a week and Muy Thai 2 days a week.  But if I had to choose I'd choose BJJ as I like how you spar (roll) at full speed. <br>  <br>  Ultimately it's up to what you like, look around because most gyms/academies offer you a few free classes to try it out. So use that and see what you like, but with those two you can't go wrong.|`|uzZuwtgXaa	Shotokan Karate.

But at for what most people above are saying about the legs is the leg muscles are big so you burn a lot in using them, BJJ tough stuff.<br>  If your not used to it you'll get tired quickly throwing repeated knees and kicks, punches too but not quit as quickly.<br>  And don't neglect the cardio, sure you get some in the sparring itself and repitition of your techniques.  But make sure to do some running too, shuffles, run backward.  As someone mentioned a 15 minute warm-up of running, I do this myself<br>  <br>  Oh and of course, it helps if your diet is in order.|`|5lxTVqD6aa	Muay Thai!!!!!!<br>  I lost 15 LBS!!<br>  No joke, it's the kicking and knees that make you lose all the belly fat.<br>  I also jog and run for the cardio part. the cardio is very mportant. i love BJJ and JJ but you in MT you throw elbows, kick, punch, knees, and dunk-dodge, your arms feel like bricks and you get black eyes.. chicks dig black eyes.|`|AA10698309	If you work hard at any style you will lose weight.

If you can see daylight between the top of the ball and the plastic (this would be the back of the head) of the head, the pocket is too deep and illegal.<br>  <br>  If your sidewall is tight and the pocket is shallow, you can loosen them up to get a deeper pocket.   If the sidewalls are loose and the pocket is too deep, tighten the sidewalls to make the pocket legal.

ErXNl2tOaa	Washington- The Redskins always make a big move, they could use another wideout that's over 6ft, and Terrell Owens would be the perfect target down the stretch with 2 minutes remaining and that could force Jason Campbell to establish a deep ball or stronger arm. The Redskins pay big money for people. Terrell Owens would also be in the same divison as his former teams.<br>  <br>  Detroit- (0-16) They are also planning on getting franchise quarterback, Matt Stafford, they already have premier wideout Calvin Johnson and Terrell Owens would compliement new quarterback greatly because of Stafford's strong, accurate arm.<br>  <br>  New England- I could see Bill making a move to acquire him after he fixed troubled Randy Moss. He would be a deadly target against<br>   defenses. All I have to say is, Brady to Owens, Brady to Moss, Brady to Welker, Patriots win!<br>  <br>  Kansas City- I could see him in Kansas because of the inexperienced wideouts there. They have a good, young wideout in Dwayne Bowe, and a veteran tight end in Tony Gonzalez that is deserving of a super bowl ring. The Chiefs also acquired Matt Cassel, with him throwing to him, that would be an extreme threat.|`|kFlMTSqYaa	Going to the Silver and Black is probably the final peace to the puzzle for the Raiders to be very successful team.

L7PkYZVzaa	I do see your point.  However some women are too bashful to go do physical exercises if they think they'll be gawked at by men the whole time.  Some men, particularly testosterone-filled muscle-heads, treat gyms as they would bars.  Some women need a place to get into shape without having to dodge pick-up lines and staring.<br>  <br>  Also, there is gym equipment that is built specifically for women's generally smaller frames.<br>  <br>  I think the reason you don't see "fairness" here is because men-only gyms just don't have a market to support them.  Men are visual creatures, and somewhat drawn to coed gyms to have something nice to look at while they work out.|`|Sr7iiZOgaa	I think it's because a lot of women are self concious.

TPZwmQK9aa	It depends on what city you are in, but odds are 99%+ that it is illegal to shoot an air rifle ANYWHERE inside your city limits.|`|cR7Sf4cjaa	You are only a co-owner, share owner, and no one party is allowed to monopolize a shared area.  The deeds to the property should have a set of covenants that govern the use of this shared property - you need to find them, read them, and verify you are not doing something that is already prohibited on that property.<br>  <br>  First - you need to establish certain times when you will be using it - and devise a plan to secure the area so nobody - child or adult - can accidentally walk into harms way.  This will not only prevent any conflict of use - it is necessary so you can warn people about your activity.  Then visit all the owners/allowed users one by one and explain what you would like to do. Once you have permission from everyone - then you can proceed.<br>  <br>  Before you go through all that work - you need to check your local city ordnances.  Be sure that discharging a firearm does not include an air rifle and what you are doing is perfectly legal.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps

He probably wouldn't let anyone thats not Canadian into the Country. And I saw that list Bob Loblaw gave, just yesterday and I couldn't believe my mind he made 7. There's no doubt about it, Don Cherry is a great Canadian. But he should be nothing more then another great Canadian Citizen, Hockey Player, and what ever you call what he does now.

daRDQE9maa	It defanitly can't hurt them. They are two very good players that will make a difference for that defensive squad this year... Albert Haynesworth is def one of the top 5 de tackles.. if not the best...|`|5628ec20b00d1a53d79e14cda6f420f9aa	I think its more of the same from Dan Snyder...|`|JH9IMMDtaa	too much money!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|5B6w8mxVaa	he got his money he's not gonna give it 100%.|`|oEOIk3nfaa	Well I am a huge fan of both players and I love the signings... but does it help our team? No, not really.<br>  <br>  Adam Schefter said it best on NFL Net this morning when he said it wasn't our defense that cost us a playoff berth last year, it was our offense. I mean we didn't get the sacks we needed last year on D, and adding the best DT in the game will certainly help, but we had the 4th rated defense as it was... But again, the offense didn't cut it. We need men on the line and a decent WR (Housh? Hackett? Coles again?).<br>  <br>  I'd say QB too, but it seems like I'm the only WAS fan that's ready to give up on Campbell. I say sign Vick, I don't care what he's done, he's here to play football... But that's just me.|`|7265d27fc13e89f482c384391b4a5007aa	I think there both good signings. Haynesworth is a big step up from what they have now at DT, but as always snyder overpays. At least there not old washed up players at the end of their career.

6ecdc0fb70eb839a2a22e77ecfde44e4aa	Roger is aiming for two more slams at least and he needs to work hard and believe in himself. If the going is tough, the tough get going and that is what Roger needs to believe in. He can hire a full time coach who can help him achieve his goal and he has to be patient because he needs one to tie and two to break Pete's record. It is not that easy as it sounds but then Roger has always made impossible things look possible. Roger loves Wimby and he would like to get two more Wimbledons before retiring as he mentioned in his interviews. Hope Roger succeeds in his mission. All the best to Rogi!|`|A1ohtlWsaa	1 wimby,2 slams|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	sorry but i am not banking on any of that.. not saying it cannot happen.. but u know... too many good players to threaten his quest right now..|`|e5o872xpaa	about 3-5|`|gP7IB2XCaa	I predict 20 slams :)|`|JQZzI49Paa	3 and 40

gUMucKOkaa	Your strategy makes sense. I also am in an eight team NL league but we have five keepers already.<br>  <br>  Pujols or Hanley, whoever is left. I would probably pick Hanley over Pujols and I am a Cardinal fan.<br>  <br>  Some guys to consider later are Pablo Sandoval, multiple positions, Felipe Lopez if you don't manage to get Phillips, Maybin at Fl, Scherzer and Kershaw. Votto may be available at 31.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to pre-rank and exclude guys that you don't want such as injuries. Wagner and Francis for example.<br>  <br>  Good luck.|`|WjIHp3WPaa	You should take Jose Reyes or Hanley Ramirez with the 2nd pick, whoever is still available.  I know that wasn't part of your question, but I'm just saying, those two guys are head and shoulders above everyone else.  They're even the 1-2 picks in mixed leagues.<br>  <br>  Webb is a really good target around 15, but he, Lincecum, Hamels and Johan Santana could all be gone.  If Johan slips and you're thinking of grabbing him, be advised that he is dealing with elbow stiffness and coming off of knee surgery.<br>  <br>  If you can't get Webb and all of the above guys are gone, forget about pitching until later and get the best 1B/OF left at this point, guys like Lance Berkman, Prince Fielder, Carlos Lee and Matt Kemp should be available and good picks here.<br>  <br>  You can wait on Troy Glaus until the 11th or 12th round in my opinion.|`|xnu5e4oRaa	Dan Uggla would be a decent pick for the homers and rbi's he will provide this year. If pujols is gone first, take howard. Julio Canto for marlins 3rd base had 30 homers last year as well so watch him. Hanley Rameriz at SS is sick. Also Josh Johnson pitcher for marlins. I would take him with a late pick. 7-1 last year. Tim Lincecum for giants is also another good one.|`|AL6O8glFaa	Try to pick up Tim Lincecum if you can, he will give you alot of strikeouts and a low era. But a late third baseman would be david Wright or Edwin Encarioncion, also, try to get jimmy rollins as a shortstop.

Cl6KbcAGaa	Next Is NOT a bike worthy of your salary sacrifice...It is a Utility bike and barely qualifies as such....stay far away from that name. Mongoose makes a  Crossway 450 made for bike specific shops but since you are in the UK and it is sold in the US I wouldnt be certain that you would have it as an option over there. Here it is nonetheless as a comparison to similar bikes that you may have over there: <a href="http://www.performancebike.com/shop/profile.cfm?SKU=25454&subcategory_ID=3060" rel="nofollow">http://www.performancebike.com/shop/prof...</a> Compare similar bikes that you may have available to you to this one and you will do well to use this bike on paved surfaces and light trail ridding as well. Any Mongoose sold by a dept store will be one of those "Utility bikes" and not at all made for any off road use whatsoever! Stay away from the dept store crap! sorry I cant be more specific for where you are but I am not very familiar with all that you have on the other side of the pond...|`|VvX51zueaa	Find a shop with sales people you like the look of and who are genuine about bikes. They will help you make the right choice. Personally I'd steer clear of big chains of shops unless you know in advance what you are looking for. Their advice is not always as good as the small local bike shop. Also don't forget to ask for discount. Most will give you something for free if you ask for it.|`|JRpSPf44aa	u should get a mongoose or a next bike they are really all around good bikes. trust me.

WjIHp3WPaa	My fantasy sources tell me that Derek Jeter is being taken around the 65th pick on average in mixed league drafts.<br>  <br>  If you are in an AL-only league, he is going around the 35th pick.<br>  <br>  My advice is to take these numbers and do the math for your league - if you're in a ten team AL-only league, Jeter falls around the middle of the fourth round.  If you're in a 12 team mixed-league, he falls in the middle of the 6th round, and so forth.|`|SEcM9EDZaa	No, no and no. I'd take Tulowitzki or Alexei Ramirez before I'd take Jeter.|`|xnu5e4oRaa	absolutely no. no way would i take him in the second round. maybe something like 4th round depending how many people are in your league.|`|q9D1mCJnaa	No he is to old and slow, remember when he drove into the stands and came up all bloody, the little hemophelic would never make it in the NFL|`|0kEc1aJgaa	Jeter is all name and no show
cLMVlWgbaa	It's actually pretty simple. They do it based on seeding, and they seed the teams based on their conference standings. If there is a tiebreaker, then head-to-head matchup winner would have the edge. If it is a tiebreaker between 2 teams with the same record but they split the regular season meeting 50-50, then that's when regular season record would determine the higher seed.|`|v5MP0KJ8aa	They rank them from 1st to last based on their conference record. Lets say there were eight teams.1 and 8 would play, 2 and 7, 3 and 6, 4 and 5. That would end they first round. Second round: 1 and 8 winner verses 4 and 5 winner, 2 and 7 winner verses 3 and 6 winner. That would complete the second round. The two remaining teams would play for the championship.
AA12274507	I personally don't like any of the CO2 pistols. The difference between BB's and Pellets is pretty simple. Pellets are a lot more accurate and BB's are really impractical for anything. They don't shoot consistently and they are not effective at all for killing anything except maybe a mouse. I have a Daisy 693 that works pretty good as far as it's operation design, I have a more expensive Gamo V3 that I think is a complete overpriced hunk of junk.
