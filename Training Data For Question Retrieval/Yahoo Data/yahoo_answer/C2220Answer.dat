But you junior year and standardized test scores are the most important.|`|x6SdK47Daa	College's are loooking less at the GPA of a student and more at how intellegent and such they really are

U8YHfKEUaa	They spend millions on building and maintenance of these rides. They are very safe because they are constantly monitored and well maintained i personally never been to six flags but i have been on some crazy roller coasters and they have advanced computers and systems monitoring every single piece of track on that roller coaster. well have fun if you decide to go. And keep in mind that millions of people get on roller coasters each day and the worst that happens to them is probably nausea or stomach ache :P|`|0YT04B43aa	Life is unpredictable! anything can or cannot happen, you just have to risk it. Those games were built and meant to be safe, but who knows destiny is destiny... All the people here can tell you "yeah they are" but let's be real, no one can promise you anything, you just have to make your decisions, that's part of life, and what was life again? unpredictable.<br>  <br>  And  yes, I've gone to six flags and went to all these extreme games and nothing happened. That was my experience.|`|LePuxQmzaa	ya but the onley one ive ever heard of where something went wrong was the tower of DOOM, but that shits fun!|`|48WkXo1Taa	I've been to six flags many times and I'm still alive|`|Nr6mTnZHaa	they are sage i went on them and i even recorded and they are safe|`|MyV9qm99aa	Are they safe?

AA11253076	You have to get so many achievements for the class.Some can be rather hard or take long but if it's like I remember than for the first new weapon you just need a third of the available achievements.After that you need two-thirds than all of them.|`|PwsjBVgvaa	Well you have to get the scout milestone achievement but idk which milestone. In order to get the milestone you have to get a certain amount of scout achievements. I would suggest looking for an achievement server on tf2. Look at the maps b4 goin into the server cause the map inplay will say achievement in it.

oM6cG1kcaa	Dude, game stop isn't going to give you **** for those. Trust me. You're better off selling them on ebay, especially if they're in new or great condition. F*ck game stop, they'll probably give you about 10-20% of what they'll sell the game for used, so your best bet is to look at how much their used prices are for each thing.|`|bsy7Pn9vaa	BOB MARLEYYYYYY IS THE BOMBBBBBBB AND A TRUE LEGEND!<br>  <br>  im gussin 100 dollars at the most.|`|GyZuqT4daa	Generally the absolute max you'll get for a used game is $35. If there's a sequel to a game you won't get much for it (Gears 1 or GH3). PSP games don't generally have much resell value either. I'd guess $75 tops. Keep in mind, some stores only give store credit. I'm not sure if Gamestop does or not.<br>  <br>  You can also consider Blockbuster, they accept game trade-ins and they usually give you a bit more than Gamestop because less people know about it, but theres a lot of games they just won't take at all.|`|CGJdITxzaa	50-125 i guess|`|5kJ2yD7uaa	1.$10-$15<br>  2.$30<br>  3.$40<br>  4.$8<br>  5.$20-$25

It is part of a 4 loom set. I learned to knit the traditional way many years ago, stopped knitting for 30 years, now loving my new method. It is so fast and easy to learn. Looms are available at Michaels, JoAnns, Walmart (best value), and around $12. I started to knit for charity making newborn baby caps on this blue loom, now use it for making beautiful scarves too. I'll be teaching classes at a local center soon. Good luck and have fun with your son. The loom set comes with instructions for the basic cap. To make a basic scarf, just decide how wide (I use half the pegs), reverse the looping procedure and continue as a flat panel. There are several instruction books, with more advanced stitches,etc. but not necessary for the beginnner. Enjoy your time with your son. sandrag|`|AA12177717	Find a copy of Melanie Falick's Kids Knitting at your library.  It's written for kids this age to learn to knit.  He'll need the needles and appropriate yarn, but this book has set a lot of youngsters on the road to knitting.|`|e0a8919e86f478199b8aec26f50c9f83aa	As the other posters mentioned all one needs are a good yarn and a set of needles. I found it was easier to learn with large needles. As for books at my local craft store I purchased Knitting and Crocheting for Dummies. It takes you step by step and makes it easier to learn. Hope your son enjoys knitting.

CGJdITxzaa	Blizzard Entertainment was founded by Michael Morhaime, Ayman Allen Adham and Frank Pearce as Silicon & Synapse in February 1991, a year after[3] all three had received their bachelor's degrees from UCLA.[4][3] In the early days the company focused on creating game ports for other studios. Ports include titles such as J.R.R. Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings, Vol. I and Battle Chess II: Chinese Chess.[5][6] In 1993, the company developed games like Rock N' Roll Racing and The Lost Vikings (published by Interplay Productions). In 1994, the company briefly changed its name to Chaos Studios, before finally settling on Blizzard Entertainment after it was discovered that another company with the Chaos name already existed. That same year, they were acquired by distributor Davidson & Associates for under $10 million. Shortly thereafter, Blizzard shipped their breakthrough hit Warcraft: Orcs and Humans.<br>  <br>  Blizzard has changed hands several times since then: Davidson was acquired along with Sierra On-Line by a company called CUC International in 1996; CUC then merged with a hotel, real-estate, and car-rental franchiser called HFS Corporation to form Cendant in 1997. In 1998 it became apparent that CUC had engaged in accounting fraud for years before the merger; Cendant's stock lost 80% of its value over the next six months in the ensuing widely discussed accounting scandal. The company sold its consumer software operations, Sierra On-line which included Blizzard, to French publisher Havas in 1998, the same year Havas was purchased by Vivendi. Blizzard was part of the Vivendi Games group of Vivendi. In July 2008 Vivendi Games merged with Activision, using Blizzard's name in the resulting company, Activision Blizzard.<br>  <br>  In 1996, Blizzard acquired Condor Games, which had been working on the game Diablo for Blizzard at the time. Condor was renamed Blizzard North, and has since developed hit games Diablo, Diablo II, and its expansion pack Diablo II: Lord of Destruction. Blizzard North was located in San Mateo, California.<br>  <br>  Blizzard launched their online gaming service Battle.net in January 1997 with the release of their action-RPG Diablo. In 2002, Blizzard was able to reacquire rights for three of its earlier Silicon & Synapse titles from Interplay Entertainment and re-release them under Game Boy Advance.[7] In 2004, Blizzard opened European offices in the Paris suburb of Vélizy, Yvelines, France, responsible for the European in-game support of World of Warcraft. On November 23, 2004, Blizzard released World of Warcraft, its MMORPG offering. On May 16, 2005, Blizzard announced the acquisition of Swingin' Ape Studios, a console game developer which had been developing StarCraft: Ghost. The company was then merged into Blizzard's other teams after StarCraft: Ghost was 'postponed indefinitely'. On August 1, 2005, Blizzard announced the consolidation of Blizzard North into the headquarters at 131 Theory in UC Irvine's University Research Park in Irvine, California.<br>  <br>  In 2008, Blizzard was honored at the 59th Annual Technology & Engineering Emmy Awards for the creation of World of Warcraft.

wQ5CWGEyaa	Hi Mr. Mills,<br>  I've responded to your e-mail and will wait for your reply.  <br>  <br>  I am so sorry that you've been banned from MF&F.  I am a firm believer in being 100% fair to everyone and I do believe in giving someone a chance to correct a problem but you told me yourself that you had been warned repeatedly but this was just a misunderstanding.  <br>  <br>  If you've had repeated chances and warnings at MFF and have broken the same rules again and that act results in other members feeling uncomfortable or upset, than that's a hard one for us.  <br>  <br>  I can't allow the staff or members of MillsberryFandF to be subjected to upset caused by anyone who simply refuses to follow some simple and necessary rules.  That's honestly not fair to anyone else and I feel a major responsibility to protect all our members to ensure that they all have a very safe and fun Millsberry Fan Site to be part of.  <br>  <br>  Please understand, when someone chooses to deviate from the rules and just do as they please, it just ruins the fun for everyone else and we don't want or need that in our group.  The Millsberry Citizen's in our Club are some of the most caring and generous people to be found on the net and they deserve better than that.<br>  <br>  But, as I said, in the interest of being a very fair person and in fairness to you I am more than willing to hear the details of your situation and what you feel happened from  "your" vantage point.  I will always listen and keep an open mind.<br>  <br>  But please understand, the bottom line is, it's only right that the final decision whether or not to retract any banning would rest with the staff member who actually did ban you.  But I will bring your apology and feelings about this to the staff's attention and see how "they" feel about you returning to the site after I receive your reply to my e-mail.<br>  <br>  Truly, Kimmi<br>  (Head Admin - Millsberry Friends And Family)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://millsberryfriends.net" rel="nofollow">http://millsberryfriends.net</a><br>  <a href="http://millsberryfandf.proboards84.com" rel="nofollow">http://millsberryfandf.proboards84.com</a>|`|Kn95gMEOaa	goldengirl9/stargurl67, you were banned because you STOLE tons of content from MF&F to use on your own site. You were informed of the legal issues involved and told to remove it. Becky continually had to go back to your site and point out additional content that you had not removed.<br>  <br>  Some of the content that you stole was directly linked to a site that Kimmi owns. By displaying those stolen images on your site, you stole bandwidth (that Kimmi pays for) from her site. Bandwidth theft is HIGHLY illegal.<br>  <br>  We don't tolerate stealing and dishonesty. I would seriously recommend doing your own work on your own site instead of stealing content from other people.<br>  <br>  It's that simple. This is the reason you were banned, and it is a legitimate reason. This is far from being banned for nothing. I would strongly suggest that you stop lying about it. I will be happy to post this after every one of your "banned for nothing" comments so that people know the truth.|`|2VmpXAdSaa	Someone one banned on MF&F for no reason!!! My MF&F username is stargurl67.|`|8PslSSqzaa	mr mills please check your yahoo e-mail.|`|91N5U80Waa	That is not why you were banned, you got banned because you were asking members for free stuff & telling them to look @ your wish list. You made members feel uncomfortable & you were warned several times not to do this. We all wanted you apart of the site but you couldn't follow the rules.
1s0eLo72aa	You named the folder wrong.  It needs to be named "PHOTO", then placed in either the Memory Stick root OR the PSP folder.  Either one works.  I prefer the PSP folder though, although I can't get the videos to work in there, so I just use the MS root.<br>  <br>  As for videos, you can use this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.vixy.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.vixy.net</a><br>  It converts Flash embedded videos from sites such as YouTube into many formats, one being MP4, which is compatible with iPods and PSPs.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.|`|K6rMUqgBaa	Try this download!|`|mim3C59Yaa	u have to put the videos onto the computer and then orginize it on the computer.

One person is "it," and has to keep their eyes closed. Everyone starts out in the pool, and the person who is It yells "Marco" and everyone answers "Polo!"  The goal is to tag someone else, then they are It.  If the person who is It thinks someone has gotten out of the pool, he or she yells "Fish out of water!" and if anyone is out of the pool at that moment, then that person becomes It.|`|AA10238582	I've never heard of that game, but when you play 'Marco Polo' in a swimming pool, you can yell Fish out of water! and if anyone has jumped out of the pool and is on the side so they can't get tagged, they are either out or the next person who is 'it.'

It is a little more difficult though because you can't have all three types of guys - soldier, special ops and medic. At least one of the two people will have to be a medic. I accessed this area of the game in the beta by going into the Cooperative menu and then selecting Offline. It isn't the full story with cutscenes but it is still fun to play. If you have internet access I would definitely give the online 8 player coop a shot (you can still have 2 people on your console and then it picks up 6 other people). It is a lot of fun because people are forced to work together and stick together. I just read that Call of Duty:World at War is going to have split screen coop to play through the main campaign so maybe give that a try as well. Good luck!|`|Gfi41ofFaa	You can not have 2 player main caimpan but I bielive you can play the game 2 player online. I just got the game yesterday...<br>  |`|mim3C59Yaa	you can't get 2 player campaign like you did in Resistance 1. You will get something similar but without the cinematic and also it will be geared towards the soldiers, not Nathan Hale. It will also be shorter. If you want a good 2 player campaign experience then go online and play it with up to 8 people in 1 campaign.

0sryIQrkaa	I recommend Rewards1, its a nice way of getting microsoft points, xbox live cards and other goodies.<br>  <br>  Its basically a rewards scheme (directed towards gamers), where you sign up, complete surveys and other promotional offers and in return you get 'points' which you can use to exchange for a range of new prizes - you can even request custom prizes, so you can win just about anything.<br>  <br>  I've been using it lately, while you might not expect this to be legal or even ethical, it is perfectly legitimate - for xboxs, live gold cards, its very simple - once you accumulate enough points (its 20 points for a 1600 microsoft points card, doesn't take very long), you simply place the order through the site and they'll email the redemption code directly to you :)<br>  <br>  Use the link to have a look, its definitely worth signing up, since you're basically getting paid for just a few minutes here and there.

With the points you can get a Xbox Live code. For 1 month it's 8 points and doesn't take all that long to get if you refer friends.<br>  <br>  It's pretty slow going if you live in Australia because there isn't many surveys. Be careful though, some might ask for your mobile then receive a pin to sign in, but it costs $2.50 for every text you get sent so stay away from those. <br>  <br>  If your still keen you can go to this site:<br>  <a href="http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=225741" rel="nofollow">http://www.prizerebel.com/index.php?r=22...</a>|`|mim3C59Yaa	You can't, unless someone gave you a 3 month code that they paid for, you can't go online for free with the Xbox 360.

de14HtA9aa	No real way to get around it other than to restart building it all over again but wait a bit till you calmed down a bit before starting back up again.  Speaking of lego's I've seen a life size R2-D2 made out of lego's in a big toy store in NYC.

1YaCGJfyaa	Bought the game 2day and i agree they are heavy as u put it, and being a huge cod4 fan it takes a little while to get use 2 it but the game is worth the persavierence just give it an hour or so and it`s quite fun.|`|837xgMwLaa	COD games have got aim assist on the console versions, it's easy to lock on to enemies, Killzone has no aim assist.|`|Qynw3YSNaa	I've tried it as well, and I like the controls. They were tough getting used to at first, but you'll soon get used to them. It feels as if you are actually wearing armour and carrying heavy equipment; you can feel the momentum when you turn, walk and jump.<br>  <br>  If you're a COD4 player, set the controls to "alternative 2". The mapping is more like COD4.|`|bxDSmcYcaa	Yeah i noticed that too. You'll get used to it after an hour or so.|`|3beddc7a6066da65201291d4e65045ffaa	I know what you mean. When I bought the game yesterday I was messing around with the sensitivity controls for like 15 minutes. I finally just raised the X-Axis and Y-Axis up two and left it like that. I play lots of COD4 and COD5, they're my favorite shooters, so it was tough getting used to it but you get used to it very quickly. Killzone 2 is an amazing game. I would recommend just playing around with the control settings for a little bit like I did. It may take a while but experimentation is the best thing you can do for now until you eventually find the right sensitivity for you. The game really gives you the freedom to change the controls the way you want them to, so take advantage of it =]. Good luck against the Higs!

plZFYzlZaa	Depends on the game, but like the person above me said, study programming code. <br>  <br>  C++ is the main code most video games are programmed in, because of its versatility. If you want to make levels, you'll also need to learn how to program computer AI (so the enemies move and attack correctly), some type of image editor (like Photoshop for making textures), a 3-D modeling program to design the actual level with (these don't come cheap), lighting, sounds, controls...whole nine yards.|`|HrewRe7saa	Some games come fitted with a level editor.<br>  Some companies give out their source code, or stand-alone level designing software.<br>  Some companies do none of this, you will need to know a good deal of languages and then get the appropriate software and access.<br>  <br>  Games like Super Mario World, anyone with half a brain could remake it, games like Killzone 2, not so much.|`|FU8DPFuEaa	Many code languages my friend, many code languages.

a1bb8fc74ef941b0b15c95e44ca6f623aa	The original WoW only lets you level to level 60. BC introduces a whole new area, for levels 58-70 and lets you level all the way to 70.  NOTE: BC did NOT add new races, it merely made it so Horde can play Paladins and Alliance can play Shamans.<br>  <br>  The new expansion WotLK raises another new land and lets you level to 80 plus the addition of a new class to play (the death knight) which is only available if you have a level 70 on your account. Pretty much you don't need the BC until your level 50ish, and you don't actually need the WotLK expansion until your 65ish.|`|etLWwYeCaa	Just to let you know, it's "what" not "wat".  Also, the letter "I" should be capitalized.  Furthermore, there's no need to capitalize the words "expansion packs".  Perhaps you should not start this game.  It appears you're completely ignorant, and there may be no turning back for you if you start this game.<br>  <br>  Now, to answer your question:  Install BC.  You can go to other cities.  It's worth it.  Install WOTLK too.  You can go there as well.  Good luck.|`|Q4xZ6t6Oaa	you do want to download the expansions when you get them. all the bc exp does is add a new world that you cant go to til you are 60 but it does not change the original gameplay. you have all the same quests and starting areas. the bc exp also adds 2 more races that you can be from the begining with new starting zones.|`|Ee7aL6W3aa	All the expansions do are add things to the origional, mainly the expansions other than burning crusade are for levels like 30 or 40 up. But you can upload the others right away also if you like|`|QKY4GXSpaa	You need to download BC because, they patched the game so much they left some patches on separate CD's, also since lich king came out.<br>  But it's always only one story, don't worry they don't change anything.|`|Ubi6HBOqaa	The expansion let you get to a higher level, discover different places, and get to a higher level.|`|SCs2inCsaa	I say install it. They allow you to go to more areas. You can make (with the TBC anyways) a new race. With WotLK you can make death knights, and go to even more areas.<br>  <br>  If you install it, you will still have everything that you had before, but you will have more options. <br>  <br>  <br>  Hope this Helps!|`|68cc82283542fb9e45877505681f26ffaa	You can still do all the original stuff, it just expands the game further.

FARkaNTsaa	Comes down to opinion really. Nonchalantly ask them what they think is the coolest.<br>  <br>  Official Site:<br>  <a href="http://shop.lego.com" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lego.com</a><br>  <br>  Star Wars theme:<br>  <a href="http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Department.aspx?d=322" rel="nofollow">http://shop.lego.com/ByTheme/Department....</a><br>  <br>  I would recommend an assortment of smaller sets. Some good guys, some bad. That way they can have plenty of fun.
69grY3Bgaa	They are all over the place... Look for the small shack-like shops along the side of roads and pathways. If you look at what's on the tables it shows exactly what they sell. I just started the game myself so I can't tell you many specific areas yet, but the bridge in Bowerstone has several of these roadside stands.
LnYr2dLfaa	Right you are, but I'm not Bret.|`|CDGLZXdYaa	xbox sucks
FARkaNTsaa	Actually, the [real] LEGO videos are stop motion. However they have professionals filming and editing them who make it perfect. Now the animated videos (3D models) of course are all computer generated (and technically do use stop motion). And also there are mixed real/computer like many of the commercials.<br>  <br>  <br>  LEGO came out with LEGO Studios a while back which is a basic stop motion computer program that came with a camera plus add-on packs. You can probably find the sets somewhere but the camera quality is quite bad. You are better off using a regular digital camera and using a basic program like Windows Movie Maker to put it together.<br>  <br>  There are plenty of programs more advanced than WMM you can get and if you're really into it I would recommend them over WMM.<br>  <br>  <br>  Stop motion takes a lot of time and can be difficult when you are trying to time things just right but practice makes perfect. The more you do it and experiment with ideas, the better you will get.

FARkaNTsaa	A good topic indeed!<br>  <br>  You can look around on the internet for ideas. There are not many LEGO models around but that shouldn't stop you from making your own. Just find old pictures and build away.

FARkaNTsaa	Such is the economy today. Everything is more expensive.<br>  <br>  The LEGO Factory models cost more than the usual sets because they are 'custom' sets that need to be put together. Each set is different so they have to put in the time to make sure you have the pieces you need.|`|PDzcF9Llaa	Good question.  It's an absurd rip off.|`|9a741e007e7238cfc31a8840ba4f506baa	Well Lego is a company out of I think mostly the US, also it costs them to ship things all over the place, in Canada we have a thing called Mega blocks, they are like half the price and sometimes more detailed than lego.  It also could be that Lego is one of the most popular building blocks of the world so they think they will still have customers even if they jack up the prices.
FARkaNTsaa	I would have expected Spiderman a while ago but it is possible, especially if another movie comes out.<br>  <br>  But it is possible that some other movie will come out soon and LEGO will decide to make sets and then a game out of it.|`|vPfwxJOVaa	dnt know probs Spiderman :P|`|4TYtwiNSaa	The game company Traveler's Tales seems to have a relationship with LucasArts and Warner Brothers - so the next logical game will probably be one of their properties. Lucas doesn't have much else to offer, but I would go with:<br>  <br>  Superman (WB)<br>  Harry Potter (WB)<br>  Clone Wars (Lucas)<br>  <br>  of course, if they could partner with Disney, Marvel, or other studios there are so many cool ones out there:<br>  <br>  Lego Shrek<br>  Lego Toy Story<br>  Lego Fantastic Four<br>  Etc...|`|ZhFvxGYiaa	probably batman or spiderman or maybe iron man. iron man would be awesome!

So things like axle length are measured this way. An axle that is as long as a plate with 4 studs has a length of 4.<br>  <br>  Color:<br>  Self explanatory.<br>  <br>  So a label might read "Brick 1x2 Blue". You can change the order to your need or even eliminate the color if the drawers are see-through.<br>  <br>  How you separate the pieces is up to you. Because axles don't take up to much room you might put them all together. If you only have a few of one type of part (in a few colors), you might put all of them together.<br>  <br>  Whatever works for you.|`|3BYkMYueaa	there is a great book called the unofficial lego builders book or something like that.

As soon as you can advance to the next level go to the next log and the next axe up. Eventually you will get to yew logs which is quite good at 400gp each and you can get a full inventory of them. Also, when you get level 75 woodcutting you can cut magic logs which are 2500gp each. But if you have alright attack, strength and defense, go and kill monsters on members. A goo place for training range is Blue Dragon under the Heroes Guild which is near Falador.

2MGJAwM9aa	It is illegal to use rosin bags to clean off your balls during tournaments , as it might ruin the lane condition . Why don't you clean your ball before and after the league ? I'm afraid that you may be disqualified from the league . Better to be safe than sorry !|`|obPSaYf3aa	It's totally illegal to place or wipe on any foreign substance on the ball's surface under any circumstance because it messes up the lane conditioner for future bowlers after you complete your league.  It also is a matter of possibly being labeled a "cheater" if suddenly the surface of a plastic bowling ball reacts like a reactive resin coverstock once the substance is placed.  Only clean cloths with no cleaning solvents on it are allowed on the lanes for use to wipe off a bowling ball's surface.  Otherwise, it's legal to use "bowling ball wipes" treated with chemicals or cleaning solvents before or after league play on your equipment.|`|mzHOGgpEaa	You should probably just stick to a towel.

n7uoE9wmaa	the best is the NDSTT but its getting harder to find|`|RTa3g9ZHaa	I have an R4 version 2, I'm really not sure what the difference is betweeen V1 and V2. The chip itself costs around ￡20 - ￡25 but that's not all you need. You also need a memory card which costs around ￡20 to store 30 games (2Gb). I also hope you are aware that you will need to download the games from an unorthodox route (not paying for them, you know what I mean, it is 'illegal' to download and keep a game unless you have an official copy of the game). If you are not comfortable with that then I wouldn't buy an R4. If the memory card is not sold with the R4 will you will also need to download the correct software to the memory card to play the games. However, I do not know how to do this because my friend did it for me because he knew what he was doing. I would suggest buying the memory card with the R4 because that should come with the correct software on it, but I bought it separately. I piad a total of ￡50 for everything: my R4 (￡25), the memory card (￡20), and my friend putting the correct software on the memory card.(￡5, although you can do this bit by yourself for free but I didn't know what I was doing). I would also not suggest downloading a lot of games if you have a limited internet connection, (say your internet service provider sets you a fixed amount of data each month) because downloading games can use a lot of data (50 - 150mb depending on the game). However, an R4 is a great alternative to buying each game for thirty pounds. I now have 30 games and I only spent ￡50. If I bought all 'official' copies of the games it would have cost me ￡900. (30 games multiplied by ￡30 per game).|`|1c1f532d0b7b25b3aae753390d6e60b8aa	I look forward to the answers received - I have a son with a DS and he wants an R4 as well|`|gB5ATj7aaa	looking though yahoo,<br>  <br>  The r4 usually comes with the micro sd + and adapter for the pc. Depends where you get it from I guess. It is just an adapter itself, so you can get another micro sd to put more on.<br>  <br>  I think the difference between version 1 +2,<br>  is version 1 is spring loaded, version 2 isn't. So you don't have to worry about not being able to get the micro sd in or out.<br>  <br>  it is illegal whether you do or don't own the originals.|`|LHLjPSAUaa	This is the best for buying the R4/R5/NDSTT:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.futura-online.com/index.php?ref=195&affiliate_banner_id=3" rel="nofollow">http://www.futura-online.com/index.php?r...</a><br>  <br>  Bye!

My choice would be Seaworld but I don't do rollercoasters.|`|Y1Af49sDaa	I have been to both and I would say that Seaworld is better. The main reason is because there are 3 parks in seaworld.

Keep putting on the strips of Moleskin until the entire top of the cast is covered with it.      That will help with the rubbing....but if it still is pushing into you then you need to talk with the doctors because they can go in and just cut it down a tiny bit.<br>  <br>  One time when I had a cast on my dad trimmed the top using a dremmel tool....I know its Not a good idea to cut any of your own cast...but you need to tell the doctor that your cast is causing you pain..it typically means that something has shifted a bit.no need to worry though...I know casts are not fun...Good Luck and I hope the MoleSkin works...You can get that usually from the doctors office too|`|AA10015201	no  you need to go have them fix it for you you can put cotton in the inside or you can buy moleskin|`|548481a26ed8b4141dd79f418a1e8e30aa	After breaking my foot and ankle a year ago I found that the cast,after getting wet, had swollen and was causing pain.

R4u4nWaLaa	You can't open a treasure chest. But you can open a antique lockbox. You get the antique lockbox by digging it up in the Colhurst Tunnels or buying it at a yard sale. To open it here's what you do:<br>  1. Make sure the antique lockbox and the antique key are in the same room.<br>  2. Click on the key. It should have the options on what to do with it. Click on Try.<br>  3. It should open and say You opened the antique lockbox and got 5,000 millsbucks! or something like that.<br>  4. If that doesn't work on your first try, try to get another key. Repeat the steps again.<br>  <br>  <br>  HOPE I HELPED!!!<br>  <br>  **If you want to see what the antique lockbox looks like, type cutiepie234570n the address book and go in my house then go to the fourth floor and click on Room for Treasure.**|`|AA12146813	Actually, you don't open the Treasure Chest, you can just have it for decoration.|`|wrnagaSlaa	You can't, you have to have all you statistics|`|8c3ae85037668c2f91a55ff81f46f98eaa	When you go digging in the Colhurst Tunnels, you will find eventually a "Lock box" It has the same pattern on the key and the box. When you find the lock box, place it in your house, and click "open" on the menu. when you open it, you get money. Once i opend the box and i got 10,000 millsbucks. Remember you cant dig if you health is below 27% <br>  <br>  You can only open the antique lockbox**Not the treasure chest you buy at the donation center.
bf7f84d4352f5921ba47fbfd2791d299aa	I havn't played that game in a while, but I do remember it being way sooner than it was in vice city. Just do a lot of the missions with very little side tracking and you will get lots unlocked in no time. If you are starting from scratch then it could take you a while since I'm sure you want to get a good body build, cool clothes, and overall skills up.<br>  <br>  By the way, bikes at max biking skill can jump some pretty high walls, and get to a quick burst of speed from setting still in no time. They are the ultimate off road/cop loser in the game, well in my opinion. Few walls are safe o.O|`|fcee70289a04461fb41e6be3023b4ea8aa	finish all the mission without fail...<br>  that will unlock all the map as quick as posibble....|`|AA11594419	Dude just keep on finishing the missions.....n u will keep on unlocking the map......
85fd6dcd155677f2db5d691936f63533aa	Pballs shot with N2 or compressed air have a constant speed while with co2 the speed varies. You cannot use co2 when the weather is cold because it will freeze. Co2 tank are way cheaper than N2 or compressed air. Co2 tanks are made of only aluminum & N2 are made of aluminum and carbon fiber. A co2 tank will probably last you longer when playing while N2 will have to be re-filled every game you play. Hope this helps you because the people that answer before I don't think they saw that this was related to Pball.|`|7713dfe131169eb64044dcb589e53096aa	We present 2338ndash2322 cm-1 (4.277ndash4.307 mum) infrared spectra of a number of N2-containing mixed molecular ices and demonstrate that the strength of the infrared "forbidden" band due to the NtbondN stretch near 2328 cm-1 (4.295 mum) is extremely sensitive to the composition of the ice. The strength of the 2328 cm-1 N2 fundamental is significantly enhanced relative to that of pure N2 ice when NH3, H2O, or CO2 are present, but it is largely unaffected by the presence of CO, CH4, or O2. We use the laboratory data in conjunction with Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) data that probe several lines of sight through dense molecular clouds to place limits on the abundance of interstellar solid phase N2 and the composition of the ices. Deriving upper limits is complicated by the presence of overlapping absorptions due to CO2 gas in the clouds and, in some cases, to photospheric CO in the background star. These upper limits are just beginning to be low enough to constrain interstellar grain models and the composition of possible N2-bearing interstellar ices. We outline the search criteria that will need to be met if solid interstellar N2 is to be detected in the future. We also discuss some of the implications of the presence of warm CO2 gas along the lines of sight to embedded protostars and demonstrate that its presence may help resolve certain puzzles associated with the previously derived gas/solid CO2 ratios and the relative abundances of polar and nonpolar ices toward these objects. Finally, we briefly comment on the possible implications of these results for the interpretation of N2 detections on outer solar system bodies.|`|5c7c77195c5538ac5f796bf67c3eb28daa	N2 = Nitrogen;<br>  A colorless, tasteless, odorless gas that is the most abundant constituent of dry air. It comprises 78.09%.<br>  <br>  Co2<br>  Carbon dioxide is the main greenhouse gas created by combustion, the so-called greenhouse effect, emitted primarily from human activity such as burning of fossil fuels to generate electricity and vehicles. Scientists believe these greenhouse gases are causing the earth's climate to change.

Also, there is a battle arena in DragonFable, so you can battle other players! I got to the DragonFable website just by typing "Dragon Fable" in the Yahoo! search bar. Signing up for DragonFable is really easy. Plus, it's free!|`|5bc28a3007da19af08c5307a8efcdf4daa	I like Endless Online....it's pretty fun....here is the website. www.endless-online.com<br>  <br>  But the game Rappelz is more fun. I don't know the url for it but just search "rappelz" on google and you will find it. <br>  Also  a game called Flyff by the same company as rappelz looks really good. i havent tried it but id like to, hope i helped.|`|c1ad4c7deb1c81f9e0226e7441bc8a3eaa	Maplestory<br>  <br>  www.mapleglobal.com

AA11989482	If the person who modifies your system is reliable, your system should be reliable.  I have seen botched jobs, and I have seen very successful jobs.  Pirated games can be good.  Again, depends on the source of the product.  You must have a good download or a good copy to work properly.  Make sure that the person modding your system know what they are doing! I have not had any problems with my modded ps2 or my modded xbox (original).  Any of my problems with the games has tended to be just a bad download.|`|08d0ef4f9a0029b3883876bf00737cdbaa	Hey Rohin... seriouly dont worry just make sure u know the person from whom u r installing mod chip in ur console... or get it done in front of ur eyes even u know the person....<br>  & there wont be any bit difference in the graphics or performance.... Even i heard some stuff like console getting hot real fast & other... But i hav orginal PS2 with mod chip installed(for 500 bucks from Pallika, delhi) for more than 6-7 months & its hasnt troubled me till date...<br>  <br>  And abut pirated games ... again its up to u... just choose new game CDs & take gud care of it......  U can find all new titles soon they r released worldwide...from pallika bazar, delhi for 50 each...<br>   <br>  i m enjoying every bit of it & <br>  do let me know what u have decided upon.........<br>  <br>  chao|`|jZJEoiJbaa	i hv been playing on my modified PS2 for almost 3 months now, and i hvn't faced any prob as yet.

MOD chips r easily available in any local shop who sells ps2. if u want 2 get ur ps2 Xbox modified u can contact me|`|sW2O4EzLaa	Well if I was u I wnt Modify my PS2 since I have a PS2 too Its not modifyd and its in gud conndition coz I bougt it like two years ago.. My friends who have modifyd them asked me not to do it coz the grapphics is really bad like 1/3 and smtimes getting stuck too so better not modify.....And if u think my answer is gud vote me 4 d best answeer k|`|2fdbc7443c540a20c47fbfa2503ff7e6aa	Modded consoles are about as reliable as the person who preformed the mod.  If they are experienced, then there is nothing to worry abut.  Pirated games on the other hand, just aren't reliable.  Purchasing emulators for a PC work well enough, but just ripping games straight from the disc is about 90% guaranteed to fail in one way or another.  I am personally against pirating.|`|AA11594419	Well I modified my PS2 and also my Xbox360. Modifying is good because we can play any pirated games and any type of games.
