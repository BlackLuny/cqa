20090225101536AAmb2jf	Pets;Dogs	Please help, My dog has psychological issues.?	I adopted a beagle about 3 months ago and she has a ton of issues. She is 3 yrs old and has been passed from owner to owner. She has abandonment issues, problems with going potty outside, does not play with toys, she has issues trying to get attention, I would even go as far to say she is very depressed. It is hard to give her love because she does not know what I am doing. I have know this dog for 1 1/2 years before I took her in and she has always been like this. She use to come over and play with my dogs all the time. I know it does not have to do with depression from the last owners. I have dealt with dogs with abandonment issues and a few emotional issues but not one to this extent. I feel really bad for her but im running out of ideas. I love her but I am also getting very frustrated. She does not listen, cowards down and freaks out when I try to punish her for going to the bathroom in the house so it makes it very hard to potty train her. Is there something a doctor can do for her? I am at my wits end and out of ideas. I know it will take time but I do not know what to do. She will even have panic attacks when she gets upset. Have any of you dealt with animals with really bad psychological issues? What did you do to help them?      * All of her problems are really extreme. I have never seen a dog like this ever in my life. I have meet and taken in many animals that were abused but this surpasses anything I have ever dealt with.

I trapped a pregnant female cat in a raccoon trap as I could see she was waddling from the weight of pregnancy and it is very cold where I live often 10-20 degrees below 0.     She was put in the guest room,  it took 3 days before she came out from under the bed.  Her buttons or teats are swollen and about 1/2 an inch big.  I can see she still looks pregnant, but is not friendly enough for me to check or feel for kittens in her.        Is it possible she has had the kittens?        Do the buttons swell before the kittens are born?      When do you think she may give birth?

20090227160505AAMHxTY	Pets;Dogs	The man down the street claims my dog attaked his dog.?	But by the time he came down to my house to tell my husband, our dog had already been in the yard for a while. He can't prove that our dog did it and he told the man next door that his dog was the attacker. Now the dog next door (who is known to be mean) is missing and the guy just knocked on my door asking for $50 towards his dead dog that he claimed he took to the vet. Are we liable? I know there is no legal liability because we called the sherrif and asked but civily, do I have to give him $50? He said the dog had papers and was registered with the CKC or the ACK or something. Wouldn't he want more? Our dog is not known to be mean or agressive.   37 minutes ago - 4 days left to answer.    Additional Details   Also, I think the man down the street might have killed the neighbor's dog.   30 minutes ago      When he came over yesterday, I guess he took my husband by surprise, because my husband did tell him if our dog was responsible, he would pay him. And our dog is currently on our a runner in our back yard since the incident happened. I can't prove my dog didn't do it, but the guy down the street said he pulled him off of his dog. I don't know what to do and I do feel bad but honestly, I think the guy just wants $50. I kind of feel like I'm getting scammed.   29 minutes ago      There is no leash law in our area and the only possible proof he would have is if he gets a bunch of people to say "yeah I saw their dog attack our dog" will something like that stand up? Also, when I questioned him about the neighbor dog, he acted like he didn't want to talk about it and he said he wants the man nextdoor to pay him too. I should mention that the accuser is kind of scummy looking. He looks like a criminal.  They don't look like the kind of people who take a dog to the vet.      I know I already posted this but I want as much feed back as possible

Its wierd though because he eats A LOT of his food and drinks plenty of water so i know he's not starving by any means. Another thing is he sleeps SO MUCH. I dont know if its just because he's so young but all he does is sleep. I never seem him wandering around the cage. He's either up eating or just sleeping...i hope its just because he's a baby but im worried that something may be wrong. I hope someone has some answers for me thank you so much!

20090227160719AALHxQr	Pets;Fish	Fish to go well in this aquarium?	My niece is looking to start up an aquarium in her room, and my husband and I have decided to set her up with one for her birthday. She's getting a 10 gallon tank that will have a heater, aerator, and filter. She said she'd like 2/3 small corydora catfish, a few small ghost shrimp, and possibly a small (2 inch) pleco-like "sucker" for the sides and/or a very small (1 inch) albino african frog. We're looking for different types of fish we can get her. Her only concern is that she doesn't want fish that are going to constantly 'reproduce', she had a tank full of guppies a few years back and they were constantly attempting to mate and the babies were very, very hard to keep up with. She said she wouldn't mind a few guppies, but no more than 3/4. She said she'd also possibly like mollies and platys, and possibly a few neon tetras. Any suggestions of fish that would go well with these, or numbers that should be used? Thanks :]

20090227162259AAnvb7h	Pets;Cats	How do you feed a kitten and a cat without them eating each others food?	Hi, I have a 1 yr old cat and a 4 month old kitten. Whenever it comes to feeding them, I'm finding it really difficult.      They're both on different cat food, and I feed them at the same time out of 2 different bowls. The kitten always gets bored of his food about 30 seconds in and starts going to eat my cats food and vice versa. I thought about feeding them at different times but it would be too difficult as they break halfway through their meals and finish it off about 20-40 mins later, plus I work full time so not really an option!      I usually have to 'chaperone' the meals to ensure they're both eating the right food, but I'm going away on holiday in a couple of days and my friend is looking after them while I'm away - so I need to get ideas for low maintenance feeding for Stevie and Harrison.      Thank you for reading and hope you can help! x

He doesn't chew his food at all, and he usually finishes his bowl in under half a minute.  I thought this is not good for him, so I decided to feed him myself.  I tell him to "sit" and when he does, I give him a kibble or two until he finishes his bowl.  This takes around 10-15 minutes.         Should I keep doing this?  Any advice?            PS: I don't care about the time spend to feed him.  I can dedicate a lot of time when it comes to my puppy.  He LOVES his food and can't seem to slow down...

She's only about five months old so she's still a baby.    Could the temps be the problem? She had a really small heat pad when I first got her and her tank was always 60-70f so I bought a bigger one (she's in a 30 gallon tank and the pad takes up 1/3 of that under the tank). It seems to get kind of warm. The air temp is about 75-80f now. Is this too hot for her? She doesn't have "substrate" I use newspaper for her, she will not lay on the heat pad for more then 20mins. She use to stay on the small one all day and night (which made me think that it wasn't warm enough).   Also what are some tricks to get her to eat? She normally eats one fuzzy (I thought it would be too big at first but she doesn't have a problem and the lump in her belly isn't too big) once a week.      Serious answers only please!   She's a baby Checkered albino garter snake if that means anything . . .

20090227163123AAGAwMm	Pets;Cats	Pregnant Cat Advice...?	I want advice from people who have experience with kittens and pregnant cats. Last year, I was moved away from home for several months and when I came back, she'd given birth to 5 kittens, but 4 were dead. I don't know the details. I don't know what happened. She gave birth about a week before I came home. The one who survived did very well without intervention. Well, I went out of town at the end of December/beginning of January when she was going back into heat. I left notices up all over the house, but they let her out and she's pregnant again.    She's tested negative for the regular diseases. The kittens are due anytime from March 5-12 depending on what happened when. Any advice for this time? This is my first real experience with kittens beyond last time. And I'm nervous something's going to go wrong. Any advice will help, I think.    I know I should have gotten her spayed. She's my only one who isn't.    Thanks.

20070105134544AAzL562	Pets;Dogs	How do you solve submissive wetting in an aggressive dog?	Yes, you read that right. My Yorkshire/scottish mix is a bit insecure but also has an agressive side. She barks and lunges at various people and passerbys but when someone kneals down to pet her she wets. I have to constantly remind guests to ignore her upon entering my house because if they give her attention she'll submissively pee. (she only barks and lunges until the point of meeting them, then she's fine). She is a very smart dog and heeds my commands well (sit, down, roll over, stay all without hesitation). She goes for long walks and heels well other than an occasional lunge or bark with children are rushing around or another dog is barking at her.   I have tried punishment and I have tried ignoring it (the ignoring it thing has reduced accidents which is good) but nothing completely stops this behavior. Does anyone have any ideas?

Same dog new questions :} Tsuni is 4 months old (german shepherdXlabrador) now and in general doing great on holding her poo and pee till we take her out. (which I usually do every hour to see if she needs to go) Also she has been asking at the door sometimes when she needs to go urgently.      However she has been doing this new thing.. when its starting to get closer to that hour (the end of her holding time) sometimes when me or my husband reaches down to pet her she will wag her tail and squat a little letting out a bit of pee. USUALLY on the carpet!   We have told her no as she has been doing it firmly but not loudly and taken her outside right away.      Im wondering if its just submission? We've never smacked her so she shouldn't have a response to a hand like that. Also she dosn't seem to be acting submissive when she does it, just walking/behaving normally till we touch her/lean over her. Even then as shes peeing her tail is up and ears up so she dosn't seem submissive at all.      ALSO im thinking since we praise and pet her right after her going pee outside.. that maybe she thinks that its ok to pee if we pet her while shes holding it.       Not sure any thoughts?

Now, they are pretty smart for your average indoor house pet, but I'm slightly worried they'd attempt to try to get on the ground. They seem cautious and careful when they walk and it's wide railing so I'm not afraid of them falling so much. I'm afraid my braver kitty will try to test his non-existent wings though.

Also, she has cats so she'll need one that won't bark at them or chase them...but I guess that just depends on it's personality. Please help!
20090429181829AAWnK1j	Pets;Other - Pets	What is the lifespan of a mini-rex rabbit?	Evryone says something different. Like one website said 6 years. Another said 8-10 years. Another said some other age! Can someone narrow it down please? I have a mini rex rabbit who will be turning 5 in July. He has a very large enclosure in a room that no one uses (except excersise). Can maybe an animal expert or vet answer this?      Thanks,      Angie :)
20090227163423AAqZmDu	Pets;Dogs	Neighbor Shot My Dog?	It's a little more complicated than "oops, my dog got out and was shot by the neighbor". and I'm NOT really looking for "he's a sick *** ** * ***** *** *** ***" I'm actually just flustered, and looking for ideas on how to get justice, I feel unsafe with this guy in the neighborhood as nobody really knows him and the few that do just say he's a deranged rednech with a drinking problem....      I live in Martinsville, IN on Lake Edgewood, which is a private community surrounding the lake, as it is fairly small in size.   The roads surrounding the lake are Privately Owned, and have fairly long driveways (estimated 50ft)    One day while I was at work, my dog (Dash) managed to get out of our yard when my grandmother let him outside to potty and whatnot. I got a call at work that my dog had been shot, but was still alive.   I have a very sweet and playful boxer/lab mix just over a year old, he's very curious as he loves to play with the dog next door and across the street and none of the other neighbors ever complain if he gets out, infact the people acrost the street also have 3 children ages 4-8 and they all love him. The leash laws are definitely a concern, but what I don't understand is how do I keep my dog from getting loose when I live on a lake, if the dog wants to leave, he'll leave...I can't put up a fence around the water...and I have a huuge yard, that just wouldn't be suitable for a tie down, and he's an outside dog, I just can't stay outside with him 8 hours a day. and on top of that, there are about 6 dogs that wander the lake together throughout the year (seeing how the lake and surrouding roads/areas are privately owned), I've had several visits from other dogs, seemingly great friends with my dog (Dash).    The man that shot my dog claimed that he had been cornered in his garage and that my dog was grownling at him, and that it was the 3rd time that it's happened. But if this has happened 3 times, why was I not told? Why was the Humane Society not contacted?      The neighbor accrost the street from him was the one that found my dog laying in the STREET, crying and bleeding due to the shot in his LEFT SHOULDER...he said he went outside after he heard 3 RAPID gun shots and my dog was hit once, which tells me that my dog was NOT in his garage like he claimed, also the Vet told me that the bullet was not very deep, if it were point black range it would have killed him and told me that he ESTIMATED that the dog was anywhere from 100 to 150 feet away, with the given velocity of the gun used (.22 handgun)   just wondering, how do you shoot a dog for growling, barking or threatening you if it's 100-200 ft away??      what ticks me off is that:      Its illegal to fire a weapon in a residential area, especially with kids out playing and whatnot...      other dogs run around the lake all year long, why shoot my dog?      No respect, I've never heard about this problem from him or anyone else before...      He shot my dog and left him in the street! there are kids around, what if the neighbors didn't go outside to see what was going on and their kids found one of the neighborhood dogs dead, and bleeding all over the street?      There is NOTHING the police will even listen to, they couldn't give a shyt, and the VET told me they see this all the time, due to carelessness of peoples pets and the police department...      Not to mention, it's a small town, so there's probly not much point in  talking to a newspaper about it...      I need ideas people, what Can I do to justify what has been wrong?         I'll post more information as needed....

20090227164435AAfqcyj	Pets;Dogs	Walking my puppy problem.?	I have a couple of problems when it comes to taking out my dog for a walk..   First off, my puppy is a 3 month old Cockalier and has only been with us for just a week.       When we take him out he doesn't want to even go past the door so we have to carry him out. And once we're outside he stays either close to my feet and does not want to leave my side.    When he does walk, he tends to go in between my legs causing for me to accidentally kick him.       He also doesn't poop or pee which is the main reason we take him out. How can I teach him to walk better and to not be scared?      Thank you =).

20090227164657AAuwcoT	Pets;Cats	Any advice on whether I should tell my friend that I alerted the SPCA to her medical abuse of her cat?	Sadly a retired neighbor chose to neuter her cat and did it without using anesthesia. She has some rudimentary training as a nursing assistant. I called a vet and the SPCA was alerted. It is illegal for an untrained person to do an intervention like this in Canada. I think my friend must be losing it to have done this. We are not that close but I am worried she may be in need of psychological help. As it is, her pets may be taken from her. Perhaps I could talk to her family? I cannot imagine that the procedure was anything less than torture. If she could do this, I wonder if she will have the sense to at least keep it from her young grandchildren who she spends a lot of time with. I know that I may lose her friendship over this but I am concerned.

No one ever tried to work with her before I got her, when I first got her she didn't even want to go outside.  It took me a week before she would even think about going potty outside.  Since then she has been doing better, she goes the night with no accidents (she sleeps in a crate), but she keeps having accidents during the day.  My boyfriend and I take her out several times a day but she still has accidents in the house, sometimes right after she just went outside!  I don't know what to do, I never had a dog before so I am not familiar with having to potty train one and not sure how long it is supposed to take or if she should still be having accidents.

I keep him in a 55 gallon tank and he's got his Ground Walnut Shells bedding and his hiding log and water bowl.  Somehow, his feet are really badly cut and torn up, and I don't know how he's doing it.  It's not because of the log, because it's the exact same one they had him with at the pet store I work at and he did fine.  I'm guessing it's because the skin on his toes is not shedding properly.  He is always soaking in his water bowl, so I've started filling my bathtub up just a little for him to lay in for a bit.  He seems to enjoy it, and it looks like it's helping, but not much.  He's a beautiful lizard and it makes me sad knowing he's in this kinda pain. If you have any other ideas as to what may be causing this, please let me know.  I also have some pics, if it will help.

20090225102050AAoThd3	Pets;Cats	My oldest male has an eye problem.?	I have 5 cats, and he has had this some what of a problem for quite some time. Hes about 5-6 now. Hes never acted like it bothered him really at all. It's never slowed him down and its never affected his eating habits or anything. I think it might be allergy related but just not sure. I've been lucky with all of their shots being up to date because my sister-in-law has always worked for the humane society. Anyway, he has a discharge from one of his eyes. It is clear with a slight brownish tint to it. I know he can see just fine out of it. Sometimes it cakes up and gets a little crusty, but he or one of the others usually cleans it really well. Like i said, he has had it for a couple of years now, but it just has never seemed to really bother him. I feel a little irresponsible for not taking him to the vet, but i've never really had that kind of money to just take him whenever. If i get suggestions that it might be fatal or really important then i'll make arrangements to take him in. If anyone might know of anything less severe and have any home remedies I could try, I would definitely appreciate it. Thank you for reading.

20090225103435AAUSYI3	Pets;Rodents	Guinea Pig.  How Far Along Do You think?	About three weeks ago, I adopted a pair of guinea pig "brothers".  The girl I adopted them from bought them at a local pet store about 3-4 weeks before that.(she had to re-home them because her son became afraid of them :(   )   Anyway, when they got here, I gave them a good looking over.  Healthy, fully grown, well cared for FEMALES.  Yep.  Stupid pet store.  These girls are around a year and a half old, and were kept in the male cage.  According to the owner of the pet store, they were by themselves.   Apparently, Rita has experienced a "miraculous conception".  Yeah, right.   I have rescued guinea pigs in the past, and of course rescued preggos, but it has been awhile.   I believe Rita to be somewhere in between 6-7 weeks with a moderate sized litter.  She is beginning to round out, and I can feel just a bit of movement.  It feels like little bubbles popping.  Her tummy is firmer by the day, although not hard.  She is also experiencing a little pregnancy related alopecia on her rump.  When holding her, and feeling for babies, her belly will sometimes shift from one side to the other.   I know this isn't a lot of information, and I wish I could add pictures.  I can't, my camera is out of commission at the moment.   But, just judging by the tiny bit of info I've included, does 6-7 weeks sound about accurate?   I don't know for sure if Rita has ever given birth before, although I suspect she has, just judging by the "pouchy" feel of her tummy when she moved in.  I rather think that she had a litter fairly recently actually.  I think this is either a case of being left with the male during birth, or someone thinking baby males can remain with mom until 6-8 weeks.  I don't know for sure, those are just my thoughts.     Rest assured, though, that she will be taken to the vet in case of emergency.

20070713210138AA0v2fX	Pets;Reptiles	I just caught a black rat snake and..?	...it's about 4 feet long and living in a 20 gallon aquarium.  I'm wondering if how often I should feed it.  I used to have two corn snakes, a milk snake, a king snake, a ball python, and a garter snake but never a black rat snake.  I'm thinking it will be similar to the corn snakes because they are the same species but I'm not sure.  It's also extremely docile for a wild snake.

20071229075322AAMEB5H	Pets;Cats	??concienciacion social??	Desde peque?os nos han dicho que consumir leche es algo sano e imprescindible; incluso, algunos van más allá diciendo que si no consumimos leche y sus derivados estamos en un grave riesgo de padecer enfermedades que nos pueden llevar hasta una completa desnutrición y futura muerte. Toda esta teoría se refuerza aún más si le sumamos los millones y millones de dólares que invierten las empresas involucradas en la Industria Láctea en todo tipo de publicidad: televisión, radio, letreros, gigantografías, internet, etc. (solo es cosa de recordar la fuerte campa?a publicitaria en que aparecían famosos diciendo "yo tomo leche"). Sin quedarse conformes con la inversión en publicidad, destinan recursos para pagarle a sospechosos (por decir lo menos) médicos para que salgan en los spots informándonos sobre el nuevo producto de tal o cual empresa lechera.      Existe una inversión millonaria desde hace ya un buen tiempo por parte de estos grupos económicos que se benefician del consumo del consumo de lácteos. ?Qué busca esta gran inversión?, pues bien, cubrir un objetivo esencial: la desinformación sistemática de la sociedad respecto a las carentes propiedades nutritivas de la leche, los elevados índices de toxinas que presentan y la verdad respecto a las crueles prácticas de las actuales Industrias Lecheras.         La vida de una vaca lechera      Mientras que los medios de comunicación nos siguen mostrando la hipócrita imagen de que las vacas lecheras viven libremente en las praderas, felices junto a sus crías pastando en la tranquilidad de las monta?as (como ciertos spots televisivos), todas ellas son criadas en deplorables condiciones: hacinamiento, suciedad, orde?o intensivo, mala alimentación, embarazos forzados, administración de hormonas, antibióticos y tranquilizantes, etc. La vaca lechera moderna es criada, alimentada, medicada, inseminada y manipulada para un solo fin: producir más y más leche.      Producto del desarrollo tecnológico, actualmente ya no se utiliza el "orde?o manual" , sino que el llamado "orde?o mecánico", el cual permite orde?ar a los animales 2 ó 3 veces al día, de esta forma la producción media de una vaca de granja intensiva alcanza aproximadamente unos 4.000 litros anuales, y sin conformarse la industria sigue buscando nuevos procedimientos para aumentar estas cifras.      Este sistema excesivo además de ser muy doloroso y molesto, provoca heridas, inflamación e infecciones en las ubres, lo cual obliga a la industria a administrar medicamentos y antibióticos; los cuales permanecerán en el vaso de leche que usted ha de beber.      En su estado normal, las vacas no dan leche todo el tiempo (como es la creencia de muchas personas). Las vacas tienen que parir para producir leche, leche que debería ser el alimento de su cría. Sin embargo, para mantener elevada la producción de leche, las industrias fuerzan a las vacas a tener un embarazo cada a?o. Esto se hace porque tras el parto la producción es máxima y podrá ser orde?ada intensivamente durante aproximadamente 10 meses hasta el siguiente embarazo. Lo anterior se realiza mediante inseminación artificial o por implante de embrión.      Por otro lado, los terneros son separados del lado de sus madres apenas nacen, lo que les causa a ambos una profunda depresión.      Los terneros son encerrados en corrales especiales con suelo de cemento o metal. Sus jaulas solo les permiten estar de pie o estirados, ni siquiera pueden darse la vuelta. Estos terneros son mal nutridos y la mayoría padece anemia ; no se les permite moverse, ya que si hicieran ejercicio y se alimentaran de mejor forma, la carne para servir en el plato se tornaría más oscura y dura , por supuesto, esto es lo último que desearía el productor.      Para obtener un ternero gordo y débil en el menor tiempo posible, el productor lo alimentara con una dieta líquida deficiente en hierro y basada en una combinación de leche en polvo y aditivos (cuando en realidad debería alimentarse de pastizales).      El único día en que abandonarán sus celdas, será el día en que serán puestos en un camión directo al matadero.      Por último, cuando desciende la productividad lechera de la vaca, lo cual sucede aproximadamente tras 4 o 5 lactancias, y en oposición a su esperanza de vida de 20 - 25 a?os, serán enviadas al matadero luego de su dolorosa existencia, para que sus maltrechos y enfermos cuerpos se transformen en un trozo de carne para servir en el plato de algún comensal (de hecho, aproximadamente el 70% de la carne de vacuno procede de vacas lecheras), transformar sus restos (huesos, tendones, vísceras varias, etc.) en unas deliciosas vienesas o hamburguesas y, para sacarle el máximo provecho, sacarles el pellejo estando muchas aún conscientes para así elaborar cuero para vestir.      Ya en el matadero, el procedimiento es similar al de cualquier animal de engorde; es decir, serán colgadas de una sola pata con cadenas boca abajo, luego se les hará una peque?a perforación en la garganta para que se desangren lentamente.      Te preguntarás por qué se usa este método, ?simple!, cuando los animales entran a un matadero presienten lo que les va a suceder, ?cómo?, sienten el olor a putrefacción y sangre que ronda el lugar, y mientras están en fila esperando su hora, escuchan los desesperados gritos de dolor y horror que emiten sus compa?eras que en ese momento están siendo desangradas y mutiladas estando la mayoría aún concientes. Ante esto, el animal que espera en la fila apreta fuertemente sus músculos de puro miedo y terror. Obviamente, el empresario no va a entregar carnes "duras" a los consumidores, por esta razón es que cuelgan a los animales boca abajo y les hacen un peque?o orificio en la garganta para que poco a poco vayan perdiendo el conocimiento producto del desangramiento (sangre que también se aprovechara para elaborar las tradicionales "prietas" o el conocido "niachi"); de esta forma, los animales mueren con sus músculos "sueltos y blanditos" para ser degustados por algún aficionado al consumo de cadáveres.      Cada vez que compras productos lácteos y en el envase se observa el nombre de alguna marca, sea cual sea ésta, siempre, en todo Chile o en cualquier parte del mundo, ese producto procederá de los procesos industriales anteriormente descritos. Sería ingenuo que cuando compras un yogur en el kiosco de la esquina pensaras que esa leche proviene de vacas libres pastando en la pradera y felices junto a sus crías.      Probablemente, si viajas a un sector muy rural puedas encontrar algunos fundos con unas cuantas vacas que no son tratadas como en las grandes factorías. Pero, así incluso, no puedes dejar de preguntarte si es ético consumir un producto que fue hecho para otros fines. LAS VACAS PRODUCEN LECHE PARA SUS CRíAS, NO PARA LOS HUMANOS. ?Por qué tanta resistencia a comprender este principio básico de la naturaleza? ?Tan ****** y egoísta es nuestra especie? ?Acaso ya dejamos de pensar y reflexionar?... Por el momento, aún tenemos esperanzas de que podemos mejorar y cambiar nuestras actitudes cotidianas entre nosotros y con nuestro entorno. Esta en nuestras manos, no en la de los políticos.               Ya lo sabes, cada vez que consumes leche y/o sus derivados, estás financiando el sufrimiento y muerte de millones de vacas y sus inocentes terneros. En efecto, consumir lácteos tiene las mismas implicancias (e incluso peores) que consumir un trozo de carne, que tambien esta mal comer carne.            y si decis del calcio os pongo esto:         Alimentos Ricos en Calcio (6 a 8 raciones):   brócoli, espinacas, leche de soja enriquecida, tofu, margarinas vegetales, zumo de naranja enriquecido con calcio, higos secos, sésamo, tahini, melaza, etc.      ?Qué cuenta como una ración de alimentos ricos en calcio?   1/2 vaso (120 ml) de leche de soja enriquecida   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de tofu enriquecido   1/2 vaso (120 ml) de zumo de naranja enriquecido.   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de almendras   3 cucharadas (45 ml) de mantequilla de almendra   2 cucharadas (30 ml) de sésamo   1 vaso (240 ml) de vegetales verdes ricos en calcio (brócoli,col, espinacas, coles, berros, etc.) cocinados o 2 vasos (480 ml) si son crudos.   1 vaso (240 ml) de legumbres ricas en calcio (soja,   1/4 vaso (60 ml) de algas secas   1 cucharada (15 ml) de melaza   5 higos secos      Muchos de estos alimentos son comunes a otros grupos (como el de vegetales y legumbres). Incluye alimentos ricos en calcio en cada comida.
