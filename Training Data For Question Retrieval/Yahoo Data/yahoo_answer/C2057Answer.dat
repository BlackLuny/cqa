tqAEoOAdaa	If you've forgot the Security Question, then there is no way you can get your password. It forms an important part for your password recovery. However I would like to extend you some help by giving you the E-mail addresses of Yahoo. Here you go:-    cc-advoc@yahoo-inc.com  mail@cc.yahoo-inc.com    Here's a step-by-step instruction on how to reset your Yahoo account password:-  http://www.tecross.com/blog/2006/09/14/s...    For more help click here:-  https://edit.yahoo.com/forgotroot?done=&...
VWrbKHuvaa	It's automatic.  Yahoo takes all your address book and tries to connect you as contacts.  They even pick names off of group emails.  Don't even get me started if you are in a Yahoo Group.  All those names.|`|AA11580836	I don't really know but for me, if I don't know someone I would not accept the add, point blank because it could either be a bot, someone who may know you, trying to mess around with you or just anyone else out there, but my advice would be to not add them unless you know them.
8yE2sYGeaa	It is less that you said nyquil, but admitted that you were 12.    you have to be 13 to be on this site|`|AA10025824	People quickly hit the "report abuse" button without understanding what they're seeing, and others do it just to be a pain.  Save the e-mail in case someone is following you around reporting you randomly.|`|VC5mEULTaa	It was because of "Plus I'm 12..."    You are supposed to be 13 to use yahoo answers.    I wouldn't bother appealing, but in the future you can fill out a form here http://help.yahoo.com/l/us/yahoo/answers...|`|odBWpML6aa	Next time answer Robitussin AC.|`|CdBdP2ymaa	I think it should be a rule if someone reports another, the one reporting agrees to have all his/her Q & A audited.  Reporting is out of hand here on YA.  There is a lot better system than the one in place.  BTW  how many violations can one get before he is beheaded?|`|JhvqUvlsaa	Well do you do drugs might not be a good question to answer on here. But I think the main reason is b/c you are underage; you have to be 13 to use Answers.|`|EV8vgMMxaa	lame.  but use a comp that allows the code to show...maybe your local library? and then "appeal" from there|`|pORmp0tfaa	isn't there like an age limit and you're not supposed to be under a certain age? aaand you admitted you're 12? i dunno|`|9vzfI4kDaa	i know what you mean.  i have got violated twice lately and not for a bad answer as i have seen some other people with really nasty raw type offensive answers and they did not get violation?|`|ghItgMZxaa	i think some people get very offended when they see the word drug come up or when you answer a ? with a rude answer.  and on that note i asked a ? last nite asked for decent answers and the first thing some idiot answered with a rude answer and i blocked them well the person i blocked had my ? removed, i appealed and my ? was reinstated just recently. some people are just too rude and have no feelings for others who are decent .  but you just might want to find out the age limit!!!!!!!!!!|`|HBFHZXybaa	I think maybe because you put your age and the age limit is 13 on here. idk. Ive gotten some violations too, which I was like "WHAT?, HOW?". I appealed many, many, many, many times and it has never worked! Your appeal will probably get denied saying "Your answer was indeed a violation to the yahoo! answers TOS".|`|xTpvnWRuaa	No one said that yahoo answers was 100% fair. I got many questions violated and I couldn't appeal and that was that.    basically..they want you to stay as rated G as POSSIBLE.

Tell your sister to send a mail describing her problem to account-security-help@cc.yahoo-inc.com. Or call Yahoo: 1-408-349-1572, explain to a customer service person what happened.

That's the only way that I would know how to do it. You don't have to download yahoo messenger all over again. You would just have to make a new ID. Takes two minutes.

uhZ38xYkaa	Because, if you notice, Polls and Surveys has lots of people, because it is easy to answer.  If someone asks your favorite color, it is easy because it is you opinion.  Only about 15% of Y!A members have information to share, and then about 2% who have the exact information you are asking.

cb422b6c3f9c9f2317116c9a1fcfe7d7aa	Nope.  It is a package deal / comes with the territory.  YA|`|jOSKNZgEaa	Yeah. Just spell a word wrong. Then, when the pop-up appears, click the tiny little black 'x' in the right-hand corner of the pop-up. Awesome, isn't it? I hate them too, especailly when it's a TV show and it's got a word with a weird spelling in it.|`|65e1b564d76980b1d0a8d6dcb9b68309aa	Yeah, there are two ways to get  of the spelling pop ups:  1. Learn how to spell better or 2, just x them out.  Sadly, xing them out doesn't eliminate them entirely.  They just keep popping back up again.  So, if you don't want to correct your spelling (I agree it's not the best spell checker in the world especially when it comes to personal names and colloquial words, etc. etc.) then just don't pay attention.   My beef is with the punctuation pop upper.  That thing drives me crazy.  Whoever, is responsible for creating that monster doesn't know anything about correct punctuation.  For instance, you put something in quotes and it tells you, "I think you have a lot of punctuation." Give me a break!|`|AA11029380	Seeing the poor spelling on most of the questions I think it's almost a necessity.....but they won't use it.|`|6PEZcgwPaa	Yes it's easy spell and punctuate properly
DUg1IkTIaa	Do you have Yahoo! 360 or is it the new Yahoo! Universal Profile?  A lot of the newer accounts are being assigned to the New Universal Profiles.    Try this:    Go to your Yahoo! 360 page (or create one):  ( http://360.yahoo.com/ )  On the menu click "My Page".  Then click on "Edit Personal Photos".  Remove all photos (if any exists).  Upload the one you want to use for your Yahoo!Answers Avatar image.  Click "Set as primary" (if the button appears).   Click SAVE at the bottom of the page.    Return to your Yahoo!Answers profile.  ( http://answers.yahoo.com/ )  Select "Edit My Info".  Select "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture".  Click PREVIEW at the bottom of the page.  Then click OK at the bottom of the page.    Be sure to do the Yahoo! Answers steps as it might cause the software to check the 360 account for changes.    It should work within the next few minutes, sometimes a few hours. Then you can add other Personal Photos to your Yahoo! 360 page.     Most importantly, the photo for Yahoo!Answers must be the FIRST one and set as Primary.    Hope this helps!|`|VC5mEULTaa	As you said, its the beta version. Follow the link here http://360.yahoo.com/ and then upload your pic. It should work.|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Maybe you haven't set it as your primary photo.

niivsTVxaa	-Yahoo! never said Microsoft were taking over, they received an offer from microsoft but i think they declined it.    -The lack of updates & lack of staff presence does not mean its closing down, many of Yahoo!s services have been getting a lack of updates at the moment, and no staffing.    -Y2-D2(Staff) could have been one of the staff members who got maid redundant when Yahoo! had to get rid of some staff members recently, due to the economy & the effect on Yahoo!.    -Yahoo! have not said what their plans are for Yahoo! star wars, but i am sure they are aware of the popularity of the service and will take that into account when making decisions.

AA11960743	This setting is controlled in the Management area under Membership. There are 3 alternatives:    ? Open (anyone can join)   ? Restricted (you approve all requests for membership)  ? Closed (only invited members can join) - If you select this option, web tools that were previously set to "public" will be restricted to members only. Once you have selected this option, you cannot change it later.|`|BKjnDG99aa	management- under group settings click membership- Membership Type and Welcome Message (Edit)     you should consider a restricted membership before a closed membership, and see if that works better than the open membership. a closed group means you'll only gain members by sending invites, it wont be listed in the directory and worst of all, you cant reverse it once you clicked saved. many mail servers reject the Yahoo invites and often they glitch.  consider the 3 options carefully
A826F92Daa	That's the thing about Yahoo's spam filter... it doesn't work.    Normally, you could keep them in the out-of-mind spam folder, but Yahoo's spam filter is terrible. Is it plausible for you to switch emails?|`|QWw26AXFaa	At the bottom of every email there should be a thing saying something along the lines of "I do not wish to receive emails from "insert name here"" This is very time consuming, but that is the only way you can not receive emails from them using yahoo.

AA11307940	Yahoo was contacted about this and say it's a glitch, they have their engineer working on the problem. In the meantime open the inbox, click View All Messages, then unread messages, if you have any late arrivals or in folders they will show, otherwise it will clear on it's own. It did for the rest of us, it took a few days. There is no fix for this, only Yahoo.Switching email from classic to the new mail, or from the new mail to classic doesn't fix it.

JwsAk5jiaa	The Yahoo! Anti-Spy button shows up as a bluish shield on the Yahoo! Toolbar. If you don't see it and you have lots of buttons on your Y! Toolbar, click the ">>" symbol on the right end of the Y! Toolbar to view any other buttons you might have.    If you still don't see it, you have to add the Anti-Spy button to your Yahoo! Toolbar. Here's how to do that:    Make sure you are signed in to Yahoo!    From the Yahoo! Toolbar, click Settings(avatar)->Add/Edit Buttons. This will take you to a configuration page. Click Button Gallery and add the Anti-Spy button (blue shield) and save your changes.    If the button doesn't appear right away, refresh the toolbar (click Settings(avatar)->Refresh Toolbar).    Once the Anti-Spy button is on the toolbar, click it and that will download/install the Anti-Spy software. Its called CA-Yahoo! Anti-Spy (its provided by Computer Associates).    Once you have the Anti-Spy button and the software installed, you can run it by clicking on the Anti-Spy button. That should open a drop-down menu with the "Run Anti-Spy" option.

vW9qF5lSaa	Um...that isn't a violation question at all.  I agree with the others -- someone obviously had nothing better to do than to mess with you.  I'm sorry that happened.    I know that my university had a ride system (with the campus police) that would pick you up if you were out late at night and needed a safe ride back to your dorm or somewhere else on campus.  We also had a bus system that would carry people around campus and the surrounding areas of campus, and a city bus system that would pick people up near campus and drive around town.  It depends on the practices of your particular college, though.|`|odBWpML6aa	"From like" is a severe violation of the core of the whole Yahoo thang.      Next time use "Really from like".|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Perhaps someone felt it wasn't a "higher education:" question, but it does open up possibilites of responsibilities and potential problems when a professor does somethng like that.    When could it turn from something benign into something more sinister?|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	It isn't. Some trolls probably reported you just to tick you off. Some people are just jerks, and Yahoo! unfortunately cannot monitor every single reported question. You can dispute it in the Y!A forum, if you want to, but it probably isn't worth it. I'd just ask the question again.|`|5dVpkTR7aa	It isn't. Sometimes, I think people just like to click your question/answer as a violation.  Oh well. It does suck. Just make sure you appeal your question to the Yahoo Staff Member Customer Care People.! Hope this helps.|`|CoEVVkNhaa	No, sometimes people do that for no reason, someone reported me two times in a row for no reason.|`|zDQIPFH2aa	As stated (we can't see any added details), it isn't, but I see how it can be misunderstood.  It is the use of the word "you" which usually is a red flag for chat violations.  If you look at the first question, my answer would be "why would a college provide me a ride and what college?"    The better way to write questions is in good complete school like sentences.  "What is the possibility of a college that a person is attending providing them transportation from an airport or train station?"  Note there is no "YOU" in the question now.    The answer to your question is fat chance, that is what taxis are intended to provide.  Only if this was a very special small college with just a few students would I even think of asking anyone, and you would have to make arrangements ahead of time.

eb4a10b7d0c7b16ef422f23a98ba67beaa	You need a total of 250 points to get to Level 2.   You have a total of 133 points, you need another 1117 points to get there.    You can vote for undecided questions at Level 1, even your own, but you need to be on Level 2 to rate answers (thumb up /down).    The best way to gain points is to answer and vote to your limit each day, whatever level you are on.    Visit each day - 1 point  Answer to your limit each day - 2 points each answer - 20 questions - 40 points  Hope for some best answers - 10 points each best answer plus 1 point for every thumbs up (maximum 50 points)  Vote to your limit each day - 1 point each vote - 20 votes - 20 points|`|F0h2iFWsaa	You are only a level 1 - you have to be a level 2 or higher to use the thumbs up & down.    Level 2 starts at 250 points.    All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)

tYutrD8Taa	Hi - Honestly speaking, I can't think of anything that you could print off except for coloring pages, or maybe you could see if there's some games you can play and then print off the rules.      i have a suggestion:  i know you don't want to run to the store, but my niece (6) and nephew (4) LOVE sand art.  they go crazy for it.  so, if you end up going to the store, maybe you could try looking for some sand art.  another crafty activity would be having them string beads to make their very own little necklaces.  or you could bake cookies.  they'll love you for that! don't forget the option of reading story books to them.  you could even try acting out the parts, like you have your very own little theatre.  they'd get a kick out of that.    whatever you decide, good luck, and i hope you have fun!|`|BAJd8raoaa	Second grade, I dunno.

Alternatively you can right click on the name and select "Request Contact Details"    Did you know that you can rename any of your contacts?  Of course it won't change on their side, but say your contact uses a screen name, and you can't remember which of your contacts is which, you can again right click, go to Contact Details which gives you an "Address form" so to speak that you can customize.  For instance, if one of your contacts is listed as "Ladykiller Leon" you can go to Contact details and up at Nickname you can alter it to "Leon" or whatever.       Hope that makes sense..

When you delete your cookies, it defaults to the old layout until they replace the cookie on your system.    If you want to keep the new homepage, don't delete your cookies.

You will get an icon for it, which you can delete by right clicking on it after you are done.    Go to your email and compose the message. Click on ATTACH located just under you subject line. At least five lines will pop up with the word BROWSE on each one of them. click on BROWSE and when the box comes up place DESKTOP in the upper box. Everything on your desktop will be displayed, which should include those that you sent there. Click on the first one you want and it shud go to the bottom box. When you click on OPEN that should move it to the message you are composing and it will be in the first BROWSER box. Click on ATTACH and that should start the download to attach it to your message. Repeat for anything else you want to attach. Be careful not to download to much ( varies with each recipient) could be anywhere between 5MB and 20MB. good luck    ....Have a great day...................

1TPGdaXJaa	Not so effective, because you will probably get 10 nonsensical answers for every 1 thoughtful answer...    However, I have been in a similiar situation trying to discuss philosophies on work, life, and ones true purpose in the world, and was able to connect with a few people who were like-minded and shared the same ideas. In particular I connected with one awesome person who really shared my same thoughts, and from there we have recently started a group outside of Yahoo Answers - and still try to find like-minded individuals through Yahoo A! based on their responses to questions, then ask them to join our group if we think they would be a good fit.    If you find someone who answered your question that you would like to talk to further, click on their profile and see if they have the link active that lets you email them directly.    What are your ideas you hope to spread?|`|03ec65bf77c70de35e61bf195676e487aa	Totally inadequate.  Not enough intelligent adults use it.|`|AA11259815	awareness?  average media?  critical mass?  drop in the ocean?    You have me confused here on what you're asking.    My thoughts of YA! ... Yes, certainly its a nice medium. Kind of like a wikipedia, and a chat room. But more in depth knowledge can be found at wikipedia and other websites. More chatting can be found in actual chat rooms or forums. Joining a Yahoo Group would be more specific to a topic of choice. And meeting people / making friends online can be done here. Yahoo Answers is a little bit of everything. So when compared to the other channels I mentioned, YA! is well rounded and serves many purposes. You can probably use YA as a mini blogspot as I sort of do. I think its a brilliant idea, having these "answers" and I think more improvement can and should be made. This has great potential in networking, communication, spreading of ideas, what have ya. This place wouldnt look much different than a forum but it would be the forum of all forums lol.|`|cWKAoUcSaa	if it is not effective then why people why ask in this link?    i think it is quite effective.

You are then to pay a "shipping company". The check will bounce and the "shipping company" doesn't exist. You lose the shipping money.

C6jFigESaa	Hi iansamadhi,    Glitches do occur on Yahoo! Answers, and it appears you came across one.  I have never encountered this kind of problem before, but if it persists, I kindly ask that you report the issue at the suggestion forum, where the Staff will investigate the matter for you.     Below I provided the suggestion forum link for you:    (Forum)  http://suggestions.yahoo.com/?prop=answe...    When composing your complaint, please categorize it as bug      Thank you      UPDATE:    Yes, I have checked your profile and saw that the question was posted twice with the same time stamp.  Like I suggested above, you can report the error to the Staff.    However, I am already familiar with the double posting of questions. This is a well known bug.  I also assume you were double deducted points for asking the question, too.

iNXqiDIYaa	just one of the many glitches that yahoo has - at the moment it is not moving settled questions to the resolved question but leaving 2 month old questions in the "answer" and "voting" sections    had a new one yesterday - after i voted on a question it told me the question had been deleted - but when i tried later found the question still there and it had registered my vote
CtJLXDJjaa	Here i am love!!! lol =]
MINy26pjaa	Unfortunately, there are a lot of children around here pretending to be adults.  There are also a lot of adults around here pretending to be adults.  They think they are being witty or funny or just don't care.  They get the 2 points for answering the question no matter what their answer is.    However, if they don't make at least some attempt to actually answer the question then they are in violation of the rules and can be reported.  You asked why people don't report this.  Some do.  Did you?  If not, you should.  If more people would actually report them, there would be less of it.      Now, don't get me wrong, I'm NOT saying to report every one.  You just can't do that, and not all of them really deserve it anyway.  But if someone gives an abusive answer of any kind (i.e. 'you're just stupid for asking that question'), they should be reported, every time.  Or if you notice the same poster going around on a LOT of different questions and giving irrelevant or nonsense answers on all, or most of them, it can get very annoying, and they should be reported.  When they start getting violation notices, they will either learn to be more polite and helpful, or their accounts will be terminated.  Yes, they can make new accounts.  But if they continue to do the same thing, and get terminated enough times, eventually their computer's address will be banned from Yahoo altogether.  Not just Answers, ALL of Yahoo, encluding email accounts!    And, contrary to what some have said, you don't have any worries about malicious 'payback' from them.  There is absolutely no way for anyone to find out you are the one who reported them unless you post somewhere that it was you.  So don't send them an email saying you reported them or answer one of their questions with the info that you have reported them, and they can never know.|`|1fjXNY7Waa	Applesauce      I'm sorry, just thought that was funny. It is annoying when they do not answer the question or post some ignorant comment.|`|8qSKcPjDaa	Peanut Butter!|`|ZfPKN1PHaa	Truly, a lot of people on the interwebs find it that, they will most likely never meet this person in real life, so why not bash this person for the lulz.  I do not bash people on the internet, but someone people find it rather amusing to hurt people.|`|dGMRX4rwaa	I hate that! I ask a question and then people type nonsense! I guess they just want points? If they're not going to answer right then they shouldn't answer at all!|`|U3qGMT6eaa	There isn't really a whole lot of a reason to report it. Yea it is kinda annoying, but it isn't really hurting anybody. You have to learn that sometimes you have to just let things go. I do agree with you that they should stop because it is just stupid, but i just don't really care enough and am not bothered enough to really want to take action. Yea i know i sound really lazy. : )|`|d4kxwVD7aa	yea I agree it is stupid. I answered a question earlier today, in which the person wanted me to explain the quote "The economy is important because people lose their jobs" and people would reply telling what the first half the quote means, which is a no brainer... like "the economy is important cause it determines how much money we get" but are oblivious and don't answer the entire question.. I would agree with what you are saying though- their needs to be some sort of IQ test that you must complete in order answer questions! haha :D|`|MejGuWr0aa	I find idiots around every corner I look anywhere and everywhere online. It's become an expected thing for me. I've trained myself to skim over responses and only really read the ones that actually make sense and answer the question. I don't report 'em because there are too many of 'em. They never go away, so I figure why bother? Don't worry tho there are people out there who try to answer the question mostly polite-like. Like me. :)|`|RoMqaTKkaa	People have different motives and that is the reason why "sometimes they post answers that don't answer the question".  I think there are four types of people that do that:    "The Haters"  These guys  literally spread hate. They hate Blacks, Marxists, Republicans, Democrats, gays, Muslims...and just about anything they like to hate    "The Zealots"  I call them the "guardians of whatever". These guys call people who don't conform to their "whatever-intellectual standard" as morons. They vehemently disagree on views opposite to their own and tends to let out a "lashing attack" most of the time.    "The Spammers"  The guys who are after points. Or mostly pranksters who want to advertise something.    "The Morons"  These guys just simply don't have a reasonable objective in mind except to mess around.|`|OZoNFxFFaa	?|`|6qsTmMQaaa	Simple: they do it for the two points.|`|AA10520442	If all they say is something like, "How could you ask that?" they have violated the question/answer format and you can report them.  Yahoo expects users to give answers that at least try to offer a resolution to the asker.  Commentary offers no resolution.|`|078bdda067d82a0dc6b47d9639e39c3faa	People don't answer the questions because they just want theh points. It's stupid and rude to the person who seriously wants an answer.|`|QPKgc1xJaa	Crazy world|`|4d5247fbc8be95ded60ba90440fe55ecaa	For one thing, people get carried away with the whole reporting thing. There is a point where all that does is tick people off and make them report YOU when you don't even deserve it. So if someone is not hurting anything or using really bad language, I say let them alone. It is easy enough to just ignore people like that. In fact, ignoring people makes them go away. Reporting them just agitates them, which encourages them to cause MORE trouble!    For another thing, people are entitled to their opinion, even if they are a jerk. Besides, aren't YOU being self-righteous now, too? I don't mean that to be a jerk or anything, but it's true. But I certainly am not going to report you for it. You have a right to think what you think.     All that said, in the most extreme circumstances I agree with you. There is a line to be drawn for sure, especially when it comes to direct insults and bad language. I just encourage you to refrain from getting carried away just because you don't like an answer. Like I said, there is a point where it will have the opposite effect you intend it to.

Apparently you assume she is hiding something.    If she is not then, even though your her son, your mother is entitled to her privacy.

Why would you want your mothers passwords if it is just for privacy.  Do not do it because you want to steal or utilize her finances for personal gain, doing that without her knowledge would indicate an addiction to something.      Her finding out you compromised her security, could also maker her look at her son differently (less trusting), and you do not want that from your mom.

QEEweJUaaa	In 2001, Five Star's 31st official single release, "Funktafied", peaked at  99 on the US R&B Chart and spent ten weeks on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, peaking at  26.[1] Five Star returned to the UK in 2002, as a trio of Stedman, Denise and Lorraine, to perform on various tours, including the 2002 'Here and Now' nostalgia tour. In 2005, "System Addict" was re-recorded and re-released. A planned re-release of "The Slightest Touch" that same year was cancelled.[citation needed] Plans for all five members to re-group and record new material in a full scale come-back were discussed for 2006/7.[citation needed] Part of these plans included a multi-million pound record deal, national tour and a fly-on-the-wall TV documentary.[citation needed] However negotiations ground to a halt. After a gig at UK holiday resort Butlins in October 2006, in which all five members were billed, but on the night three impersonators turned up,[2] Lorraine announced her departure from the line-up, while Stedman, Denise and Doris forged ahead recording solo material.[citation needed]    Stedman's solo album, as yet untitled, is complete and ready for a release date in the UK. It was showcased to the public, journalists and music industry members in London in February 2007.[citation needed]    Denise revealed in 2007 that she too is working on solo material.[3]    Delroy continues to live in LA with his family producing for U.S. music acts.[citation needed]    In March 2007, the group's record label, Sony BMG, released a brand new compilation DVD of all their hit music video's called "Five Star Performance", which reached No.25 on the DVD music charts.    2008 is Five Star 25th Anniversary, Stedman and Denise have agreed to do a few PAs at Butlins. March 29th is the first gig with Stedman and backing dancers whilst Denise is at work Songwriting in Sweden. October 2008 Denise will return to join Stedman and the backing dancers for gigs at Butlins over October and November 2008. Stedman Pearson appeared on Celebrity Scissorhands on BBC1, for Children In Need 2008. Doris and Lorraine interviewed on radio to talk about their life in the group and what they are all doing now. Denise will be performing in the West End in Thriller Live at the Lyric Theatre from 2 January 2009.|`|0e33e812d76b8f8fe9810d0893f6e0b7aa	In May 2001, after many months of creative writing and "developing their own personal sound," Kingsize was completed. When it was time to begin filming the video for the debut single off the album, however, band member Sean had fallen ill with glandular fever. The "Let's Dance" video was released with a life-size cardboard cut-out standing in for the ailing singer, and rumours that he had in fact left the band had to be quashed. Scott also temporarily left the band for a few weeks to be with his then-fiance Kerry Oaker, who was having troubles with her pregnancy. Their son, Brennan Rhys, was born on 11 July 2001, five weeks premature. The remaining three members, J, Abz and Ritchie, pressed on with heavy promotion of the group's third album and the "Let's Dance" single. Whilst performing at a concert in Belgium in July, Ritch ripped the tendons in his left foot, putting a halt to all promotion and prompting the group to have a few meetings to re-think their options and future. "Let's Dance" was released in mid August 2001, however, and became their third UK  1, holding the top spot for two weeks. Kingsize debuted two weeks later at Number 3, going on to achieve Gold status.    After a month of serious meetings with record management, Five came to the decision that they were "calling it a day", and the group disbanded on 27 September 2001, via an announcement on MTV Select. On 28 September, a day after the announcement, Scott married his childhood sweetheart, Kerry Oaker, at a ceremony with all of his former bandmates in attendance.|`|rpqHLJGGaa	They were all shot for crimes against the music industry|`|QTEtHANVaa	They all died of aids|`|BUCwZYnzaa	sigh. that brings me back. and they died out just like every other boy band ever made

2f739e8b2a5530e501bad3e76a9cb2f7aa	Sorry, but the Yahoo Photos site was close last year. They gave us MANY warnings and notices of this happening, they gave us the option to MOVE the pictures to new sites, one of which THEY provided (flickr) but if you did not take advantage of the option at that time, the photos were lost when the site was finally closed.    NEVER, EVER put something on the internet as 'lifetime' storage. You simply don't know what the future will bring. That is why there are CDs to burn pictures to, or external hard drives, etc. It is a hard lesson to learn but you MUST learn it.

6qsTmMQaaa	If you want to use a personal picture as your avatar, you have to activate your 360 profile. To do that, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click on the button that says "My 360 profile" in blue letters. It is to the right of your ID. Once you set up the profile, you can click on the button that reads "Edit Personal Photos". That takes you to a page, where you can upload an image you wish to use as your primary photo. After you have added the image, you can set it as your primary. Then, go to your Yahoo! Answers profile, and then click the button that reads "Edit My Info". You will see three boxes down near the bottom toolbar on the page, and the middle one reads "Use my Yahoo! 360 Picture". Check the circle next to it, and then scroll down and save your profile. It will take a short period of time for the picture to process, so be patient. Hope this helped! Good luck!|`|mxJCE3nZaa	Sign into your email and you can change it there.

F0h2iFWsaa	All levels can pick a best answer to questions they ask and can vote for best answer on others' undecided questions.  Once you hit level 2 & get the ability to 'rate', the only difference in the levels is the daily limits on questions, answers, comments, votes, etc.    Levels 2 and up can 'rate' the answers of other Y!A users.  Rating = giving Thumbs Up & Down to express your opinion of other peoples' answers. No points are involved (unless a best answer has TUs, then they get 1 point for each TU up to 50) in rating, and thumbs do not determine the Best Answer selection.    Levels 5, 6 & 7 have unlimited questions & answers each day.    Hints:     answer your limit of questions each day (2 points each)  get an answer selected as best answer (10 points each)  pick a best answer for your question (3 points)  vote your limit of unresolved questions each day (1 point each)  you also get a point a day for signing in    each question costs 5 points, so ask sparingly    :o)     http://answers.yahoo.co m/info/scoring_system;_ylt=Aplad92Pq_Flp...|`|a66nvk0taa	You get to stay on longer when answering questions etc|`|8yE2sYGeaa	Although the ceilings raise, Lv 5 is key (unlimited answers)|`|5fb39523f75c15b623115ea5cd8f29eeaa	You can see the full point and level chart it details what the advantages you get with each level go to the link below.  http://answers.yahoo.com/info/scoring_sy...|`|LnYr2dLfaa	As you raise your Level you can answer, vote for and ask more questions.

SrvIwG7Yaa	I understand how you feel- people call me a " quiet, and shy little geek" when I'm really this crazy ( sometimes violent)  wild-child-but I would strongly advise you not to revolt back-- you would be just doing what these other guys want you to do. If they say you are "quiet", "shy", etc.,even though you know you really are not-- screw them-that's their problem!( I don't care what others think of me-- in my eyes i'm normal and if someone can't see that that's just too bad)  Their thoughts shouldn't matter to you and they have no right to label you this way if they don't know you well enough. I my opinion, being quiet and shy isn't a bad thing, but if you don't like others looking at you this way, I would suggest telling them to get to know you better before they say ingnorant things like that and then just walk away--- you don't deserve to be around people who don't appreciate and understand who you really are,not what they "think" you are. Good Luck ( and remember you need to accept yourself, not depend on others for it)( Sorry if it is annoyingly long)|`|Q3bcGeaOaa	G'day mate.  one remedy is you can email me.

It can possibly rival sites like answers.com and Google Answers. The main benefit of a united question answer system is the convenience of not having to signup to various specialized, genre-based forums for answers. In order to ask a question or to answer one, one has to have a Yahoo! account.    This Yahoo! service has been found to be very addictive by many Yahoo! users. Members may ask virtually any question except ones that violate the Yahoo! Answers community guidelines. To encourage good answers, every one or two weeks, Yahoo! Answers features a participant on its Yahoo! 360 blog page, who consistently provided good answers.|`|AA10785542	Yahoo! answers is one of the Meany Yahoo! services.   It is hosted on a Yahoo! sub domain, as of mostly all of yahoo! services.    A sub domain is like a expansion to www.yahoo.com  This is a example of a subdomin: www.Services.Site.com  there are Meany other formats for sub domains. that is the one yahoo! uses. so for answers the sub domain is:  www.Answers.Yahoo.com | As with for mail:  www.Mail.Yahoo.com | witch redirects you to your assigned mail page/server. the server is located on a multi sub domain:  http://us.f819.mail.yahoo.com/  OK. now that you know of sub domain's.    Yahoo! answers is runned on a community-based format. it runs from Multi-databases. these databases include:    Answers  Questions  users  points    and more. these databases are put in log format so Admins may read them at any time. Yahoo answers is a big maker/DB writer, like mail, etc.    what that means is: All it does is write/retrieve database info.  Every time you log on/off. most likely yahoo! answers writes:    soandso logged on/off at 00:00 PM/AM on 0/0/00     and so on with all info. its very complicated. it users variables. if you right click on yahoo! answers and click "View source". that's all the HTML coding it goes in to making yahoo! answers.  in "My Q&A" see all the info that varies from person to person.  Ex: My Questions | My Answers | My Points | etc etc.    thats all variables, also written on a database.    So basicly: Yahoo! Answers is a community-based format service that allows users to ask and answer questions made by other users. People will ask/answer acording to the yahoo! answers community gide lines, located here: http://answers.yahoo.com/info/community_...  if your a good questioner/answerer, yahoo! answers team will put you as a fetured user on thier blog. yahoo! answers is also a place for knolage and learning.    Hope this helped!    P.S. please excuse my spelling. im getting the error:  Oops, the Spellcheck is having problems, please try again.    P.S.S. this is from Yahoo! answers being updated most likely.|`|AA11469363	It helps in knowing things better or sharing a thing you know.

AA12048654	Yahoo! began as a student hobby and evolved into a global brand that has changed the way people communicate with each other, find and access information and purchase things. The two founders of Yahoo!, David Filo and Jerry Yang, Ph.D. candidates in Electrical Engineering at Stanford University, started their guide in a campus trailer in February 1994 as a way to keep track of their personal interests on the Internet. Before long they were spending more time on their home-brewed lists of favorite links than on their doctoral dissertations. Eventually, Jerry and David's lists became too long and unwieldy, and they broke them out into categories. When the categories became too full, they developed subcategories ... and the core concept behind Yahoo! was born.     The Web site started out as "Jerry and David's Guide to the World Wide Web" but eventually received a new moniker with the help of a dictionary. The name Yahoo! is an acronym for "Yet Another Hierarchical Officious Oracle," but Filo and Yang insist they selected the name because they liked the general definition of a yahoo: "rude, unsophisticated, uncouth." Yahoo! itself first resided on Yang's student workstation, "Akebono," while the software was lodged on Filo's computer, "Konishiki" - both named after legendary sumo wrestlers    http://docs.yahoo.com/info/misc/history....|`|25b27238b0f07e48272beee5a6d23b57aa	Yahoo! was founded in 1994 by Stanford Ph.D. students David Filo and Jerry Yang|`|AA11440088	i don't know...no care.
