You have to read both sides' stories then decide for yourself what's going on.|`|4h41aLa8aa	There was a time when all media was extremely liberal. In the 90's more conservative news channels (Fox News) came along and presented a more conservative view point.|`|6mXvwy7Jaa	Bias should not be stopped and cannot be stopped. <br>  <br>  Being biased is part of being human. If we didn't become biased we would die. For example, I am biased against running around in he street. Some people are not so biased against that. Some are more biased. Some of those people get hit by cars, others are late to work because they insist on using the crosswalk half a mile away.<br>  <br>  As for the media, it is the age of the internet. There are plenty of other news sources out there. Stop complaining and just go look. If you insist on getting a balanced account, look up the same issue on sites slanted in different directions. Make your own decision about what happened. The bias you can except is the one that is your own so why not make it up yourself?

But they will need to get a bigger lorry next time, and crash somewhere else, where the chance of surviving is less,and this lorry driver should be investigated, because he says he fell asleep at the wheel, and great we have drivers who are unfit to drive on the road....|`|cKtyAmATaa	well how could we possibly know?  we can only go on what the past shows us, it is the most likely cause, no number plate on the truck, although that particular road was notorious for accidents.|`|XqJmeTYJaa	Its sounding like it as any one that goes up against him has had a accident but can you believe all you read and get told .<br>  from what i know it sounds like he will be involved in some way|`|397c9d81c14e30952a7c9e86f700fc70aa	Yes...

If he'd wanted to kill Tsvangirai he'd have already done it.  Mugabe would prefer to discredit him by giving him the appearance of power yet not actally allowing him to do anything.

V clever really.<br>  <br>  However, let's hope I'm wrong and he does actually manage to make the changes necessary.|`|X5H8RHH1aa	Seems that way, and I wouldn't put it past him.

The idea that mankind is civilized is a fantasy. At this very moment, the entire world would be at war, if nuclear weapons had not been invented.

Two British soldiers have been killed. I'm not surprised it has happened because I know that dissident republican groups have been threatening this for a long time.<br>  It's a pity that the political parties have been locked in a stalemate over progress towards power sharing for a couple of years now. If we'd seen more political progress these terrorists would have been even further marginalized than I hope they already are.<br>  I think it's important that we hear unequivocal condemnation of this attack by all political leaders in Northern Ireland and the politicians should press ahead with power sharing now.

That, at the opportune time, would produce fortunes for their farming and business supporters. The fat man just brought onto the front benches of the tory party is an aredent euro supporter, he is there for a reason.<br>  <br>  Troops in Afghanistan, well dont look for the tories to do anything about that, the tory cronies have their hands in the tills of the munition manufacturers and wars sell arms.<br>  <br>  So you will see little or no change by voting for the tories except, under Labour, some of the stupid policies that Labour follow allow a few crumbs of comfort to fall through to the average man on the street, however, under the tories, those crumbs are strictly controlled and few and far between, thre will be nothing left for the man in the street, just like the 18 years leading up to 1997.<br>  <br>  Those who claim that labour inherited an excellent economy from the tories are talking about the economy under which hey lived. The economy which provided high interest rates for savers, high retail prices for commodities and a glut of privatised industries in which to buy shares.<br>  The economy of the average working man under the tories was shot to pieces, 17% mortgage rates, poll tax screaming through the roof and food prices at an all time high.<br>  <br>  That is what the tories produce every time they are in power, that is what they will produce if we are daft enough to let them in again!<br>  <br>  Sorry for the long answer, but it boils my blood to imagine the likes of cameron smiling his way in to raise the axe on behalf of the tories again.|`|S8RL9lieaa	I have often thought about this and he wouldn't be my first choice.

The effect of the UKIP and Referendum Party votes since 1997 has delivered a lot of seats to Labour at the expense of the Tories.<br>  <br>  On a seat by seat basis, the Tories tended to need around 50% of the vote to be guaranteed the seat, in the 1997 and 2001 landslides. Labour on the other hand seem a little more able to take a marginal seat on around 40% or 45% of the vote where minority parties on the right stood, hitting the target around 70% of the time, compared with the Tories only hitting around 25% of their targets in the 45% bucket.<br>  <br>  Gordon Brown will be PM for many years to come on this basis.|`|qKdQpZ5Kaa	I don't trust Cameron, I remember the last Tory government too well.  The fact hat he never makes it clear exactly what he will do leads me to think that it will be something designed to make his own type richer at the expense of the man in the street.<br>  <br>  I don't want to see any more of the Tories economic and social experiments being played out, I'd rather stick with Brown.|`|AA12050428	No I do not think he would be a good choice, he never seems to be completely genuine nor to have any real  depth to his ideas.

On the issues that matter to me and my family Labour win on every one. <br>  <br>  Health and Education - The Tories have agreed to keep to government spending for the first term of the next government before reviewing - and that will be down. Great back to 1980's education and waiting lists.<br>  <br>  Immigration - there is little to pick between them but Labours actually have a policy of returning illegal immigrants that are not genuine asylum seekers.  Anybody else notice they were very quite over the recent wildcat strikes?<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Immigration.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Wher...</a><br>  <br>  Economy - The tories policy scares the sh1t out of me.  Despite saying we cant afford to borrrow money they want to guarentee loans to failing businesses.  They will not be asking for guarentees or shares in these companies nor will they be sharing in the profits that these loans may make.  No we as taxpayers take all the risk and the banks take all the profits.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Where_we_stand/Economy.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.conservatives.com/Policy/Wher...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  The scary thing is if the Conservative party was any good at the moment they would be streets ahead of Labour at the moment and they aren't.  They cannot start demanding an election because they dont know if they would win.<br>  <br>  <br>  Plus Cameron is soooo cheesy and hangs around with a grinning cheshire cat!<br>  <br>  <br>  I actually think whilst Labour have made some mistakes (VAT was one) the financial stimulas and getting credit flowing again is the only solution.|`|9d792c6e2da6e5b53a036baec7115b43aa	You say everyone hates or wants shot of Brown. Please do not generalise. I for one would much prefer him to carry on and win the next election as the alternative does not bear thinking about. Cameron is a milder form of Thatcher and if he comes to power I can see unemployment rising dramatically and less investment in Education and the Health Service. Any tax benefits will be for the well off and the rest of the people will be forced into basic obscurity. He speaks a lot but after listening to him and reflecting you realise he has said nothing. He is a great one for sound bites but is probably one of the worst opposition leaders for some time.|`|UtdCFo6Waa	im only 14 BUT i h8 gordon brown as him and his cabinet appear to be corrupt ( they take unnecessary bonuses, and are allowed to claim thousands of pounds on expenses)<br>  since gordon brown can pile on money to irresponsible banks who started and make the credit crunch worse, but can never afford to help cancer patients who cant afford treatment or help hospitals buy life saving equipment i have no faith in the flabby wrinkly old man<br>  <br>  i believe that cameron is the way foward, as he is younger (nothing gr8 to look at obviously but he will have a better insight to the real modern world and even a better understanding) he alsp has realistic pollisies and in my opnion would spend money in the right places.|`|w0ZqjJBtaa	David Cameron, nor any Tory government is the answer. What David is good at is saying nothing and letting Brown bury himself. By the time the next election comes; people will vote Tory just to get shot of Brown but will do so not really knowing what they stand for. It's scary. It'll be too late to worry and complain once they get into power. I may be wrong but the only people who will benefit from a Tory government are those who are wealthy and have no concept of the real world outside of their bubble.|`|SYU4JIohaa	I want rid of Gordon Brown, but I don't want David Cameron.

We are talking to Al Queda, just as we had a dialogue with the IRA and Hitler during WW2.

Who is a terrorist anyway? <br>  If you start labeling people then you can get into trouble.

It′s quite another negotiating with arms bearing criminal killers.<br>  <br>  It′s an insult to their victims, it sets a dangerous precedent and it′s going too far with a "non violent" response.<br>  <br>  Who would sit down and chat with Al Quaeda?? And why?<br>  You wouldn′t negotiate with a screaming two year old who′s having a tantrum. If you do, you justify his means of acheiving his goal.<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit :<br>  Jomamo is talking about the situation in The Basque Country with E.T.A...Which she knows about FIRST HAND.|`|Lx6TXgHKaa	It's an over-simplistic concept at best.<br>  <br>  If the terrorists perceive you weak, they are not going to talk to you anyway.<br>  <br>  And it's a two way train. We cannot be seen "not in the control" of affairs. I always believe in "tit for tat"<br>  <br>  Non violence didn't win for you the 1962 war with China, did it? Nehru was termed an eunuch at best for offering peace to Chinese. Hurts? Isn't it?<br>  <br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Also look at Dalai Lama. For almost 50 long years he has been talking of non-violent approach to deal with Chinese Communists. What has he got? He is called a liar and a slave owner, demonised like anything in Chinese media. The only thing he seems to have won is International respect. Has non-violence brought about any difference for Tibetans?<br>  <br>  To sum up, it all depends on the person you are dealing with. Non violence is not the universal solution even though it seems the best and a potent weapon.|`|7lkLZ57Saa	Worked with the IRA.<br>  <br>  Only the most simple minded (e.g. American Republicans) think you should take terrorists' stated goals as non-negotiable and representative of the views of the entire organisation.<br>  <br>  Edit:<br>  Jomama seems unaware that the British governemnt started secretly negotiating with the IRA long before any ceasefire.|`|VYywucN8aa	i believe in non-violence backed up with violence  when needed.|`|46a14ceb5e21165137def6a6f8a9df2eaa	Rather words then blood|`|Or7wuZpaaa	Talking is better than fighting no matter who the person is. You find out what is on his mind and even if you don't convince him of thinking how you think at least you heard what he had to say as if what he said mattered to you personally and then you spoke from your heard about how you felt the issue could be resolved. It's obvious with all the continued bloodshed that talking is better than fighting. But some of those people have gotta drop their pride and listen. It's the same when a husband and wife are in a marriage. Are they going to file divorce over jealousy or every little mishap or are they going to peacefully express their feelings and listen to each other and find common ground? That is the delimma that is going down here. All the people involved in this war fighting have got to come to an agreeement and honor that agreement from their hearts if this killing is going to stop. Helping others is far betting than hurting, torturing, & killing them. There is no love here: just fear, anger, harm, death, pain, and sadness.|`|avhgLEu8aa	Anything is better than having to resort to violence. It rarely makes things any better.|`|hZIVKiFdaa	As long as terrorism isn't confused with freedom fighters then no. Direct action is the only answer.

Other countries dont recognize the north of Canada to be a part of canada and want to go their and take stuff. One of these countries is Russia. Keep in mind this is my opinion. I think they are testing us to see if we are on our toes. Or I believe they wanna see if they can get to the U.S through Canada. Anyways we got a weak military latly its been getting better. If they try anything you can trust that the U.S and the U.K will have our backs. In the united states waters alone they got enough power to destroy the northern hemesphere of the world. The other day in Toronto the army was at my school recruiting which is odd. I believe we need to serve our country in this day in age.I believe we should investigate wheather these are training missiles or not bu telling them if they dont land their plane we will shoot it down. Canada has to show we arnt playing any games with any country in this day in age its very important to show urself as a strong country that isnt afraid. If your concerned like me join the military I am because of this.|`|n6kdfpSEaa	Yeah...that's Russia for you. They have many issues to deal with. Russia has been building up relations with some bad countries like Iran, Venezuela, etc. Relations between Russia and the West have been deteriorating like crazy and I don't think that trend will turn around too soon.

You crazy nut.|`|AA11589988	No because millions of people will have to lose what they currently own on credit and their debts will be passed on to the taxpayer in terms of welfare and bailout payments to businesses and individuals. In my opinion a dose of high inflation would help right now to diminish the real value of those debts. That is probably why the US/UK central banks are currently printing more money and base rates are at around 0.5%.|`|b0f0f231555e5da9d455a8890388f3cbaa	The only ones who agree with you are companies that print pink slips.|`|Mp9Q9An4aa	Very interesting & tough question. The answer depends on one's own personal situations. <br>  <br>  Savers lose out on low interest rates, homebuyers [people who bought a house as a home as opposed to an investment] benefit due to reduced mortgage repayments - the same goes to some degree to anybody with credit/debt, which is most people.<br>  <br>  Taxpayers lose out because most governments will use money in [usually futile] attempts to stimulate the economy. The poor benefit from lower inflation rates PROVIDED THAT they don't lose their job or get a pay freeze as a result of the recession. <br>  <br>  Businesses who are still recruiting benefit from the fact that they have a larger number of candidates... Those looking for work are disadvantaged by this.<br>  <br>  In most cases there are more people who benefit than who lose out so you have a strong argument, however, those who spend on the extravagances you mention are among those least likely to be impacted by a recession - they're in high-end secure employment, and often high on the list of beneficiaries of state stimulus packages.<br>  <br>  A recession highlights flaws in the current economic model. One where so many billions of dollars are lost but few are gained?!?!? An economy where money can simply disappear into thin air is fatally flawed or criminally corrupt. <br>  <br>  There appear to be more winners than losers, but we need high employment so it's difficult to say whether a recession is good or bad... BUT if governments and financiers actually learned anything from it then I would have to agree it's a GOOD thing.|`|5fwIsT9Baa	I don't think its a good thing cause im just after finishing school and college and  there are no jobs so i wont have any money the government aren't giving that much money on the dole like ...people who have families are losing out on a lot you see where i come form people aren't millionaires and live life without all the luxury's when they have the money|`|4OLpe1Ylaa	I agree with you for the most part. Americans have used credit for so long and many are knee deep in debt because of it. If you don't have the cash to pay for it then don't purchase it. You really can live without Prada and saying no to your children once in a while is actually a good thing. <br>  <br>  The big problem I see is unemployment. I'm looking for work but so far nothing.

Do you know someone that drinks? Ever seen someone drunk? Someone that's gets mad when they drink? They want to pick up a gun and shot you most of the time, or beat your head in with a brick, or just cause you or anyone else great bodily harm. Most pot smokers I know of are to mellow on pot to want to fight. And most cops I have talked with say they would rather deal with a pot smoker them someone that has been drinking. I used to work in a store at night and cops came in all the time to eat lunch and just to hang out and talk with me, so I know what they would say. Try it, you might like it?

Those who haven't tried something, be it hang gliding fishing or what ever don't need be to talking.|`|RQ5vToQEaa	whats your source of information about weed causing cancer and mental illness?you make the argument like you represent big Business's mentality about how only government can tell me whats best for what ails me, i smoke,i don't have cancer or mental illness, i tried to quit smoking and took the meds prescribed, which was zyprexa, that approved medication was the cause of a doctor wanting to cut me open and "check" my pancreas....i quit the meds,kept on smoking,and i haven't been to a doctor since.my sister has cancer,she gets very sick from the 200mg morphine shes given for pain and chemotherapy,she smokes now because it helps the nausea,helps give her an appetite.....dont you hear the long list of side effects any medicine has?you don't want to put up with stoners but you want to retaliate against them...that sounds like the man...
FTZB7W2Gaa	im 17 years old. My parents are running out of money. It forced me to become homeschooled so i will have time to get a job. and yet. NO where is hiring. SO im screwed either way.|`|4JNyhT2gaa	It's bad trust me.  look @ the stock market.  if u r retired and have your money in a 401K and not plowing anymore into it, u r screwed.  like the tide it'll b back, but not in 6 hours!!|`|SbH5c7jdaa	yes, everybody has been affected in some way.|`|N4ezdVHMaa	Foreclosures have dropped the value of my home.  I couldn't sell it now if I wanted to.|`|OIQvZ87gaa	Yes, everyone I know has been affected from loss of savings to loss of investments to the cost of living, to loss of jobs. Anybody left with a job right now is waiting for the other shoe to drop and it will be their turn. Everyone is putting off spending except for bare necessities. Our  mailman who has been with the post office 6 years is being laid off if they go to five day delivery..Sad situation.|`|9bc5507e27aa152af1a669262e3ff164aa	i work at a restaurant and some of my customers have lost their jobs i also have had my hours cut back
AA12040384	omg i saw it yesterday here in the US.it was amazing!<br>  <br>  Joe+yellow v-neck=hotttttt|`|NNzsX31oaa	no clue. search it on google.<br>  <br>  i saw it !  lol i live in the u.s and it was reallyyy good. everyone was jumping around dancing/singing and it didnt look like we were watching a movie lol<br>  <br>  =D
2c3fad97ea8b5e911078dc2d53597dddaa	When did this happen. I saw the whole video on TV. if you get the right link send it to me too. :)|`|DFrzrmiDaa	Sleep again and have it as a dream again.
N3OB7M8maa	Because, just like Alan Keyes stated, Obama is a communist.<br>  <br>  Have you noticed that Obama wants to federalize everything; the banks, the auto manufacturers, insurance companies, mortgage companies, and health care. One of his cabinet members has even suggested charging a mileage tax.<br>  <br>  In order to charge a mileage tax, the government will have to install GPS's in all vehicles, so everyone can be tracked by big brother, and mileage can be monitored and charged for.<br>  <br>  If that's not communism, I don't know what is.<br>  <br>  So far, Obama has had a negative affect on our economy. Some of his own party are distancing themselves from his agenda. The Dow has dropped faster under Obama's presidency than under any other new president in nearly 100 years.|`|cIttXzrwaa	For the sake of transparency.  I, for one, want to know how the elected officials I have to vote or not vote for stand.  How else do I know whether to back them or not?|`|P5RXApdNaa	You got it! That way someone can watch who you are voting for, and then see if they can make you loose you job or maybe your home, deny you a bank loan. In general black ball you from every thing! Black-ball means to keep you from doing something.|`|GHD8JicSaa	Wrong election.  <br>  <br>  What they want to do is make union elections open ballot elections.  That way everyone will know who voted against the union.   If the idea of the union bosses paying you a visit for "wrong" voting does not get you to vote "right" then nothing will.  <br>  <br>  As far as the next election,  they said many times a sitting president would come up with some excuse to declare martial law and block the election.  The problem is,  it is the states that run the elections,  not the federal government.   I do not see any president with enough power able to keep 50 states in line when it comes to suspending the elections.
yM6VOWzUaa	i want it too!<br>  someone help us!|`|SMtwspxraa	Mega upload.|`|gl4MePuDaa	this is close<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kza8otN7LLM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kza8otN7L...</a><br>  <br>  i love transexuals
D8rjkxBTaa	If he's got the brains for the job, he could be a presidential adviser.
ZaSiPFvtaa	"On March 2, the Coleman team rested its case after five weeks of testimony. The contest resumed on March 3 with the Franken team presenting its counter arguments."  -- from the Wikipedia article cited below<br>  <br>  I don't think enough time has yet passed for the Franken team to have completed their arguments -- it's complicated -- so it looks like it's still tied up in court.|`|HFGjaRYjaa	Nope not yet|`|jeNxVE3paa	He has not yet won and Minn. Supreme Court just turned down a motion by Franken that would let him sit until the lawsuit is settled.  Still to close to call|`|D8rjkxBTaa	Seems to me that Coleman, or whatever his name is, needs to let go of this issue.  Franken won the election.|`|94999207fac55776c0f040db3e7d1a50aa	F Al Franken. I cannot believe that our society put someone like him in a position with that much power.|`|XAkLPdhqaa	Franken is the conservatives reality nightmare!|`|cIttXzrwaa	Franken did win, but is not officially Senator yet because Norm doesn't have enough class to just accept the fact that he lost and forget the lawsuits.  Not everyone has Al Gore class.
