HEDSOHq1aa	first, wolves are classified under: Least Concern (IUCN 3.1)<br>  <br>  <br>  Humans historically have had a complex and varied viewpoint of wolves. In many parts of the world, wolves were respected and revered, while in others they were feared and held in distaste. The latter viewpoint was notably accentuated in European folklore beginning in the Christian era, though wolves did feature as heraldic animals on the arms and crests of numerous noble families. Many languages have names meaning "wolf", examples including: Scandinavian Ulf, Albanian "Ujk", Hebrew Ze'ev, Hungarian Farkas, Serbian Vuk, Ukrainian Vovk, Romanian Lupu, Lupescu/Lupulescu, and Bulgarian Vǎlko. Wolves also figure prominently in proverbs. Many Chinese proverbs use wolves as a description towards any ill-willed person with a hidden agenda like Wolf hearted (狼子野心) which could also connote to the impossibility of taming bad people, while Wolf heart; dog lungs (狼心狗肺) refers to an ungrateful person who later betrays someone who previously helped them. The Kazakh language has up to 20 proverbs referring to wolves, while the Russian language has 253<br>  <br>  <br>  Wolves are usually hunted for sport, for their skins, to protect livestock, and in some rare cases to protect humans. Historically, the hunting of wolves was a huge, capital and manpower intensive operation, requiring miles of netting, specialized net-carts and big drying sheds for storing and drying nets. The threat wolves posed to both livestock and people was significant enough to warrant the conscription of whole villages under threat of punishment, despite the disruption of economic activities and reduced taxes.|`|ku2tP4eEaa	The gray wolf is not endangered.  The red wolf was extirpated from its habitat by people.  Wolfs have never been domesticated nor kept as pets.  Only real wolfs you can see are in zoos.|`|mAZi1eH7aa	In a technical sense most animals are in some level of danger due to various factors, and wolves do fit into that category. However, not all wolves are in danger. <br>  They entered this category from a series of misconceptions. They were believed to be a danger to farm animals and domestically hunted creatures and a bounty was placed on them in many areas in the US, hunting them to near extinction in many areas. Many federal parks have re-introduced them and the populations are on the rise again.<br>  The Northern Timber wolves and the Grey Wolf are a strong breed in Canada and are not in any danger.<br>  The misconception cited was that they were after the large prey. Although this is true in only extreme cases, where small prey are not available, wolves tend to prey on small creatures. Mice, Rabbits and the like are the typical food source for the wolf, and they are a pack animal and hunt as such. Finding a source of food and gathering is done as a group. One large animal is typically not what they will seek. Since the smaller animals are usually found in abundance and can feed their group easily, that is what is hunted.<br>  Although they do not generally try to associate with other animals on a social level, it is not unheard of to see wolves befriend and associate with people and some dogs and horses. You will often see them near deer. This is because the deer tend to stir up the ground and send the smaller creatures into movement.|`|tUq6qU3Naa	Wolves became endangered in populated areas( where humans live) because they are serial killers that eat anything that has blood in it.  Such as humans.  Wolves rip the flesh off people and eat them while they are still alive.  This is NOT a good neighbor to have.  There is a nice song -Peter and the Wolf, and fable, 'my you have such big teeth, Grandma'. They describe the fears people of old had from having wolves around.  Same as rattlesnakes and mosquitoes.  If the enviros could they would resurrect saber toothed tigers and have them roaming around in Hollywood again.   Wolves are 'used' by fat enviros who would deny people their homesteads and agriculture.  Part of their desire to DEPOPULATE the Earth.|`|AA10834367	To "ifoyo"...what sources did you use to get this info? If this is the way you think, you need to re-evaluate your whole thought process. Wolves (as well as many other opportunistic predators) will catch and kill any creature they see as potential prey. They don't just "rip the flesh" off of humans. If a wolf, or more likely a pack of wolves, is responsible for a human death, they did it out of pure instinct. To them, a human is just like any other creature they encounter, a deer, rabbit, squirrel etc. It's people like YOU that are the reason wolves have become endangered. There is no other reason. It's man's perception of wolves that has led them to be where they are. If years ago, someone had said that butterflies were "serial killers", then today, there wouldn't not be many butterflies. It's not because they did anything unnatural, it's because man has found it necessary to kill anything that he's afraid of or can't live with.|`|a17766dad56e7d236a0a1f8b1237f3b2aa	Wolves are not endangered.

Luego, se vierten a la “basura” como si los desechos orgánicos no sirvieran para convertirlos en la mejor tierra con la que producir los mejores cultivos. Si la tierra nos da las frutas, verduras, cereales y demás productos, es justo que devolvamos a la tierra los nutrientes.<br>  El químico alemán Justus von Liebig (1803-1873), en uno de sus experimentos, quemó diferentes cultivos y examinó la ceniza, descubriendo elementos como el fósforo, el potasio, el calcio, el hierro, el cloro, el nitrógeno y el sodio. Llegó a la conclusión de que esos elementos los habían extraído las plantas de la tierra y que por tanto es preciso devolver esos elementos a la tierra para que no se agoten y los cultivos sigan extrayéndolos. Von Liebig observó que los fertilizantes químicos disminuían la cantidad de humus del suelo concluyendo que aunque los abonos químicos mejoran las cosechas a corto plazo, empeoran la calidad del suelo y hacen que desaparezca la importante vida animal de un suelo fértil. Desgraciadamente, sus estudios sobre los abonos químicos tuvieron mayor relevancia.<br>  Pensemos que en un centímetro cúbico de un suelo fértil pueden existir 1500 millones de peque?os animales (saprofitos) que viven de los restos de animales y plantas en descomposición transformándolos en los elementos químicos que necesitan las plantas. Esta es la razón por la que para mantener un suelo sano y fértil es necesario no fumigar con insecticidas ni venenos químicos y abonar con compost, que es el mejor abono para todo tipo de plantas (de cultivo u ornamentales). El compost es fácil de fabricar a partir de todo tipo de restos de materia orgánica (hojas secas, cáscaras de fruta, estiercol…).<br>  Es urgente establecer los mecanismos para que nuestro consumo esté en un ciclo. Si el agua está muy contaminada podrá quizás limpiarse, pero los desechos sólidos no podrán emplearse como abono. Por tanto, ya no estamos cerrando el ciclo. Si la cáscara de un huevo la tiramos a la basura, los elementos que contiene (calcio…) dejan su ciclo para estancarse en un basurero. Evidentemente, es complicado hacer llegar la cáscara del huevo a la gallina que lo puso, pero ese ciclo tan corto también es raro en la Naturaleza. Lo importante es no cerrar el ciclo y no importa si ese calcio de la cáscara de huevo acaba en una planta de nuestro huerto o en otro lugar del ciclo de la vida.<br>  Resulta llamativo que mientras en las zonas ganaderas se produce demasiado estiercol y contamina tierras y agua, en las zonas agricultoras se necesitan abonos químicos que contaminan tierras y agua.<br>  En la misma línea de saber más sobre el origen de las cosas nos podemos preguntar: ?de donde procede toda la carne que se consume en los países industrializados? Es una pregunta interesante porque esa gran cantidad de proteínas cárnicas deben salir de la tierra, ya que los animales no son productores. El origen de esas proteínas es de origen vegetal. Los animales son utilizados como transformadores de proteínas vegetales en animales, pero en ese proceso se pierde mucha energía, se pierde mucha agua, se pierde mucha comida en un mundo demasiado hambriento y sediento. Pensemos que no es posible vivir en un mundo donde casi 7000 millones de personas coman carne diariamente. ?Qué haría falta para conseguir eso? ?Se puede garantizar una vida y una muerte digna a los animales que utilizamos en nuestra alimentación si queremos comer carne diariamente? Hay gente que parece pensar que las hamburguesas y las salchichas nacen en el supermercado. Esas hamburguesas y esas salchichas se han producido a costa de algún sufrimiento animal, de un consumo de agua y, en definitiva, de energía que es preciso considerar. Si dejamos de comer un kilo de carne de res habremos ahorrado entre 50.000 y 70.000 litros de agua. Y es que se necesita mucha agua, muchos alimentos vegetales y mucha energía (gasolina) para alimentar un animal durante toda su vida, su muerte y para el transporte de su cadáver.<br>  Es triste constatar que en demasiados casos la gente se comporta como si no supiera que los microbios, los insectos o las ara?as, forman parte del ciclo de nuestro alimento y que los necesitamos para que la comida llegue a nuestra mesa. Es cierto que el ser humano tiene características que lo diferencian claramente de otros animales, pero por ello tenemos que ser responsables. Debemos comportarnos con la Naturaleza como un buen hermano mayor, que no se siente superior pero sí responsable de cuidar bien a sus hermanos. Una gran ayuda para la Naturaleza es contribuir a cerrar sus ciclos. ?Podremos algún día cerrar los basureros?<br>  hojala te sirba<br>  <br>  |`|WD76NkkBaa	se manda a argentina,<br>  alli reciclan lo que se puede comer :)<br>  les hacemos un gran favor!<br>  y nos quitamos los problemas de la basura ;)|`|EJLKnPFMaa	Hoy día la solución dominante sigue siendo enterrarla, ya sea en antiguas mínas de arena/grava/tierra/cal/etc (para reponer la monta?a), o en hoyos construidos exprofeso. Muchos pueblos en el tercer mundo aún la queman, otros la avientan en las afueras, en algunos casos ya le ponen tierra, y muy pocos hacen lo que es un "relleno sanitario": una línea de protección del suelo, capas de tierra y basura, y al final una chimenea que canalice el gas que genera la basura a un quemador o a un generador de electricidad. Esto supone que los líquidos de la basura (lixiviados) o se tratan o se vuelven a regar para acelerar la "biodegradación".<br>  En algunos países desarrollados están caminando a soluciones más avanzadas: los residuos orgánicos se aprovechan como abono, generación de aceites o generación de electricidad; los residuos inorgánicos se aprovechan al máximo y lo que sobre se compacta en "pacas" y ya sea que se canalicen a un "relleno sanitario seco" o se utilicen para cimentar alguna estructura (una carretera, por ejemplo), se reduce al mínimo la generación.<br>  Soluciones más avanzadas son el plasma (la basura se derrite a 5000 grados y se convierte en una especie de magma que se transforma en ladrillos y se genera gas a partir del hidrógeno que contienen los residuos, los cuales mientras más revueltos estén, mejor); la torre azul (se acelera una descomposición física a partir de balas de calor); la pirólisis (incineración sin generar dioxinas o furanos), entre otras alternativas.
a4778e09f64b00673a4e002289a9f490aa	Overall temperatures seem to have stabilized this decade. With long term trends like these you have to think in terms of decades, not years. Natural small downward cycles can occur as part of a larger upward trend.<br>  <br>  Looking at a graph of global average temperatures, 2008 was on the cusp of breaking the trend. Was it an abnormal data point based on La Nina (as those "crazy liberals at NASA" say), or has the upward trend broken?<br>  <br>  I'd say 2 more years of flat or declining temperatures might indicate a broken trend. Looking from 1965 to 1995, there were some 1-2 year periods where serious dips occurred, but the long term trend was definitely positive.<br>  <br>  Seeing as the current hypothesis is greenhouse gases contribute to global warming and there hasn't been a serious decrease in production, a statistically significant decrease in the next 2-3 years might require a reworking of the hypothesis.<br>  <br>  So, to summarize, 1-2 data points don't make a trend.

The chances of there being someone exactly like you among all the people who ever were and all the people who ever will be is basically zilch.  <br>  <br>  Besides, as everyone else said, it's impossible to have a "twin" who's not related to you - the definition of twin means it has to be your sibling!|`|b36a3ea5053129e74f60939bd03c219faa	Look at the definition of Twin. If you don't apply to the definition, you don't have one|`|AwOi6U2Taa	not every one has a twin we may have a twin people can be combined with different faces and such<br>  <br>  ps i can have peiriods for some reason|`|5UxQVmekaa	sureeee

"For environmental purposes" ???<br>  Lacking any other method to decide, I would suggest you use the lowest cost solution.  <br>  Determining the carbon footprint of any product is an enormously complex task.  Tree: farm or wild  lumber truck, mill, truck, process, truck, store, car, office, truck landfill or incinerator (energy/fuel or waste).  Natural gas, pipe, chemical plant, truck, manufacturer, truck, store,car, office, truck landfil or incinerator.  Wow, no clear winner.<br>  ARE paper plates recycled (food contact surface?) My guess is only to a limited %.  Why not recycle the plastic ones, too?<br>  To be sustainable, everybody washes their own place setting.<br>  lol - that'll be the day.|`|BLTo4xL9aa	for my opinion the best is the paper plates. because after you use paper plates you can recycle until it make again a good paper plates.....|`|7ZeT3Krkaa	If it is made of a type of plastic that can be washed and reused, it is better for the environment, but you then have to be aware of public health rules about dishes that are shared.  If the plastic is not meant to be washed and reused, you are better off using paper since it will biodegrade and plastic won't.  Some paper products can be recycled, but most just goes into landfills.  There really isn't a lot you can do with paper plates once they have had food on them, especially if it is greasy.

q9jHdie9aa	as basic as this question is - its a great one!<br>  You can recycle in many many ways. Every item that you are going to toss in the trash ask yourself, 'can this be reused in any way?'<br>  .. for example: everything from soda/pop cans, to the foil used to cover leftovers, to plastic mouthwash bottles most can be recycled. There is a triangle with a number inside on the bottom of all plastic items manufactured; this tell us what type of plastic was used to make that container/item. Some are 'food grade' some are not. The number inside is where you look to see if your town/city/waste disposal company will take it. If it is a number that you can recycle then put it in your recycle bin. You may also put all glass and cans in there too. This is known as "Co-Mingle", and refers to - plastic - aluminum - glass.  <br>  If you call the town/village/city that you live in - where you get your mail- ie: Briarcliff - call the 'Department of Public Works' and ask if they have a guideline hand-out you are to follow. Also ask them about the bin(s), and days of the week that are pick up days.<br>  Now once you've figured out what -by law -  has to go into that co-mingle bin, now you will have a paper recycle bin/can too!<br>  Most all paper is recyclable; the newspapers, magazines, mail, cardboard you use most likely can go in the paper bin. Again, ask your local town/pick up company what they take and do not take. <br>  And since I am on the subject - there is one more thing I would like to touch on.. COMPOST. <br>  I know - it sounds yucky - but its not.  <br>  All of the food scraps - (non fish -non meat - no grease/fat) go in the compost! Even the paper towels Ive used, and eggs shells - coffee grinds - fruit and veggie scraps - dead plant leaves/dirt - hair - etc... can go into a compost bin that you can build or purchase from Westchester County government (about $45.00) put it in your backyard and let it decompose. No it will not smell or attract vermin, unless you do something very wrong... which isn't likely. I have had one for years and love the rich compost I use and toss on my veggie garden and flowers all summer long! I even top dress my shrubs in the spring with a shovel full.<br>  Now this part may seem daunting or even impossible if you live in an apartment - but I bet you can find at least one of the ways to recycle and reduce what goes into our landfills.<br>  There are lots of places to go to get assistance too. Your local library is a wonderful source of information too. And if you cant tell - lately *everyone* has something to say about it.<br>  I hope that helps!  <br>  Happy recycling!!|`|VNRJnNr2aa	I burn my paper products and some can goods.I have a permit that <br>    I can burn my household waste with a filter trap with water steam to produce clearer smoke with 0 carbon emissions.my can goods I melt and make a block and send it to my recycling plant for money...|`|bxs3pAAjaa	you put it out with your trash and the recycling truck comes around for it. you can look online at your trash collector's website and see how to get a bin. sometimes they might cost a little something or have a drop off fee but sometimes theyre free or at least free for you to come pick up. paper, plastic, tin cans are recycleable. but not all plastic is so be careful and look for the recycling symbol. certain numbers on these are recycleable but im not sure which.|`|lKscJRWnaa	usually you will get a bin if you live in a city or town. if not and your really serious about this put all of your recylables in a trash bag and give it to a relative when they come up for a visit. as for where to put it out at the edge or your drive way is the best.|`|uKwi1t8taa	paper and cans pop cans used books<br>  you go to your town office that is where they have them<br>  put your bin to the curb when it is full
