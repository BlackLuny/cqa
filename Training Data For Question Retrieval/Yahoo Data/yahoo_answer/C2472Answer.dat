j5Apt8hWaa	Are you talking about the people who run the video or motion picture cameras?  If so, you will need to get a degree in film making and while there start networking with your fellow students, instructors and any industry guest lecturers who come on campus.<br>  <br>  At present, USC and UCLA have the best programs if only for the fact that they are in the middle of the motion picture capitol of the world and many of the instructors there are working pros, so connecting with various production companies and crew is much more likely than if you were in the mid-west taking a course in TV production.|`|GtBOQPKqaa	My sister received her degree in Communications - Radio/TV/Film from Glassboro State College (now Rowan University) in New Jersey, in 1993. Her degree covered using the type of videography equipment you describe.<br>  <br>  Aside from researching schools and such programs, you could contact your local television station regarding the education specifically. Some employers will also reimburse your tuition, so look into that, too.
0LgpcOBDaa	Yes, plastic, is... well, plastic.. It has flaws when used to replace something which was traditionally metal. But, it's cheaper and the lens is "cheaper"...<br>  <br>  I snapped a lens mount some time ago by slightly wedging it between my thy and a car seat as I was getting in the car and setting down. Luckily I had a El cheapo deluxe dead lens here at the house (I keep all old "worthless"  and after some "work" I switched out the plastic broken one with a metal one.<br>  <br>  As said tho, how much off n on you give it, dirt, sand even fine dust will take it's tole in time. The plastic is NOT very robust and if not careful when off the body and the rear body cap not on, a seemingly simple "bump" could break a flange. Be careful.<br>  <br>  Bob - Tucson|`|j5Apt8hWaa	It is all about precision.  In the five to six years you will be using your camera, you should not have any issues with wear unless you get sand  or grit between the body and lens mount .. not good under any circumstances, plastic or metal.

There is even one about a DNA project.|`|AA12343309	Here is a good website<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.jewishgen.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.jewishgen.org/</a><br>  <br>  DNA can be helpful if you find family trees you would like to match yourself with.  By itself it really isn't all that good.  It has to be used with other research<br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer. <br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene..." rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.
KBBonf97aa	If you're tone deaf, there's probably not much you could do that would make you a good singer.  But most people improve naturally the more they sing.  Voice lessons help many singers, though you'll still get better even if you just sing in an unstructured setting.<br>  <br>  Being the best singer in the world isn't everything, since a lot of well-known singers have developed their own signature style that more than compensates for their vocal limitations.  It you have a limited range or an odd voice, it would probably be a good thing to learn guitar and start writing songs for yourself.  That way, you can tailor songs for your specific voice.  Singers like Macy Gray, Sade, and Hank Williams, Jr., all have very limited vocal capabilities, but they've built great careers by working within their limitations and developing vocal styles that are very distinctive.  Most of us weren't gifted with octaves of perfect pitch, but that doesn't mean we can't become singers.  Good luck!

That is because your grandparents would be their great grandparents.  Now your children and your first cousins' children would be second cousins. That is because the share great grandparents. <br>  <br>  <br>  Whenever an aunt or uncle or one of your siblings marry someone, their family is not necessarily related to you unless you share a common ancestor.  If your grandfather remarried, your parent would be considered step brother or sister to his new spouse.  However, any nieces or nephews of the new spouse bears no title of relationship to you or your parent.  However, it might be your parents and grandfather would prefer you to refer to them as cousins.

GomZ9oYHaa	OH gee Ma.. this poem is sad but yet glad. I know what you are talkin about. Taking a step towards(i hate to say it but Death) Once you take that final step there aint no going back. But you know each of us are climbing that step to Heaven or wherever we go. We take a final breath and thats it for taking steps. I love the last thing you said: It was the climb of a lifetime<br>  to a place we all reach<br>  where once there, all that's left <br>  is to let go <br>  <br>  and take faith's final giant leap. That is the final step. Love it MA.|`|S9bEtVCSaa	Your words and poetry do lend a hand with the help we need to get up those stairs. I see faith's final giant leap as more than just "the end."

W9XTYRHpaa	14 is usually the age where people like that kind of music. Believe it or not most people there are teens; you would fit in fine. You'll probably want to go with a few friends, because it's better to not be alone in this kind of festival. Plus, you'll fit in better because about 98% of the people there will be with friends. Besides, It's not about the people, but the music.|`|oWVUiDEMaa	Yes, yes you should go.<br>  Doesn't matter about age.<br>  Just go with friends<br>  Why waste a chance to see some of your favourite bands just cos you don't think you'll fit in, don't worry about it.
eOcc6EOeaa	I may not be a dancer, but I know someone who had the same problem.<br>  <br>  I would suggest to look at their back side as you can see all their movements. By looking in the mirror, it confuses your mind as its a reflection, not what he is doing exactly. As for the memorization, try getting someone to record the practice for you and watch it a few times over. This seemed to work for a friend.

You're not going to be able to find it on the internet without looking at an entire episode of a show, Americans don't really see it as something special as to having it a name or a special video or something.

HVRNoPuoaa	Overall Good effort, when creating literary work  observe not to use slang language since the standard of the language will determine the standard of your poem in your poem you have used  a word "screwed" try substituting this with a proper word that will convey the same feeling.|`|Qas05nZraa	I love that work|`|Xl7Hak1Zaa	Great|`|8L9RnMHOaa	wow. just wow! that's really good it made me stop and think and i could really relate. can you explain the end to me a little better? email me or make a comment ill definitely come back to see your poem if you make one.|`|AORzmqdXaa	wow that really ryhmes A+++++++++++|`|CHayJkV1aa	Wow!

I love it. <br>  <br>  The Mortal Instrument Series by Cassandra Clare- The books are about a Girl who can all of a sudden see this whole other world, with Demons, and warlocks, and shadowhunters- who hunt demons. She falls in love with one of the shadowhunters only to find out a terrible secret from her past.<br>  <br>  The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins- Set in the future, The U.S. is overrun by a type of dicatorship called the "Capitol."

He follows a girl as she is fostered by an anti-nazi family and as her world falls apart around her.<br>  <br>  Kite Runner - Khalad Hosseini<br>  About two best friends, one fortunate and rich, the other his servant, growing up in 1970's Afghanistan and follows the fortunate boys story through life.

I’m generally not much into romance and I loved this.<br>  <br>  The Tomorrow Series - John Marsden (young adult fiction but they're amazing)<br>  A group of teenage that are camping in the Australian bush when Australia is invaded by enemy soldiers. It involves every genre pretty much, adventure, drama, romance, friendship. I have read the series too many times <br>  <br>  Angela's Ashes - Frank McCourt<br>  McCourt's autobiography of his growing up and living in poverty in first New York and then Ireland with an alcoholic father, depressed mother and many many siblings. I cried so hard in this book. <br>  <br>  To Kill A Mockingbird - Harper Lee<br>  Ultimate classic of a girl whose white father, an apparently lone non-racist, defends a black man obviously wrongly accused of murder<br>  <br>  One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest - Ken Kesey<br>  Another classic. A psychiatric institution that is turned on its head by McMurphy, a man obviously not insane. The manipulative warden Nurse Ratched dictates the ward with shocking consequences.<br>  <br>  Tuesdays With Morrie - Mitch Albom<br>  The true story of Mitch Albom's old professor who is dying and every tuesday, gives Albom a lesson of life. <br>  <br>  The Poisonwood Bible - Barbara Kingslover<br>  A Reverand, his wife and four daughters move to the Congo to try and convert the locals to christianity. The point of view of all the daughters allows us to see how they grow and mature and learn that their father is not all controlling.<br>  <br>  The Obernewtyn Chronicles - Isobelle Carmody<br>  A post-apocalyptic world ruled by a dictatorship of a government. Some people begin to show signs of advanced mental abilities (read others minds, have visions of the future etc) and are burned or taken to "farms" which inevitably mean death. One of these "misfits" is caught and we follows her awesome journey<br>  <br>  Life of Pi – Yann Martel<br>  In this story, the protagonist Piscine "Pi" Patel, an Indian boy, is shipwrecked and stuck on a small boat with a tiger, hyena, orangutan and zebra. It’s a riveting story of how he survives for over 200 days.|`|N8aYsq73aa	If you like vampires you will love the The Night Watch Trilogy this trilogy is by a russian Author.

hgwAT1hAaa	Could it have been In the Shadow of No Towers by Art Spiegelman?  His books are usually like a graphic novel with lots of illustations and art.

EBrgRBT3aa	In the middle of the twentieth century socialization was a key idea in the dominant American functionalist tradition of sociology. Talcott Parsons (Parsons and Bales 1956) and a group of colleagues in the US developed a comprehensive theory of society that responded to the emergence of modernity in which the concept of socialization was a central component. One of their interests was to try to understand the relationship between the individual and society – a distinctive theme in US sociology since the end of the nineteenth century. Ely Chinoy, in a 1960s standard textbook on sociology, says that socialization serves two major functions:<br>  <br>      On the one hand, it prepares the individual for the roles he is to play, providing him with the necessary repertoire of habits, beliefs, and values, the appropriate patterns of emotional response and the modes of perception, the requisite skills and knowledge. On the other hand, by communicating the contents of culture from one generation to the other, it provides for its persistence and continuity. (Chinoy, 1961: 75)<br>  <br>  For many reasons – not least his excessive approval of modern American life as the model social system and his inability to see how gender, race and class divisions discriminated against individuals in ways that were unjustifiable – Parsonian functionalism faded in popularity in the 1970s. Reacting to the functionalist notion of socialization English sociologist Graham White, writing in 1977 said:<br>  <br>      … it is no longer enough to focus on the malleability and passivity of the individual in the face of all powerful social influences. Without some idea about the individual’s own activity in shaping his social experience our perspective of socialisation becomes distorted. (White 1977: 5).<br>  <br>  During the last quarter of the twentieth century the concept of ‘socialization’ has been much less central to debates in sociology that have shifted their focus from identifying the functions of institutions and systems to describing the cultural changes of postmodernity. But the idea of socialization has lived on, particularly in debates about the family and education. The institutions of the family or the school are often blamed for their failure to socialize individuals who go on to transgress social norms. On the other hand, it is through a critique of functionalist ideas about socialization that there has been an increasing acceptance of a variety of family forms, of gender roles and an increasing tolerance of variations in the ways people express their social identity.<br>  <br>  Social norms reveal the values behind socialisation. Sociologists, such as Durkheim, have noted the relationship between norms, values and roles during socialisation.<br>  <br>  ANSWER

VM9Vsf9naa	In reality there is no such thing as time. It's only because we are existing at a slower rate of vibration that we become conscious of time. So yes, tomorrow is a lie since it only exists in the mind.<br>  <br>  However, if you have plans that you are putting into place, perhaps about where you'd like to go for a visit, then you need to prepare and your departure will arrive in due course as each tomorrow becomes a today.

Today is the current day, or night from the next sunrise.<br>  <br>  The tomorrow is the complement future, from the plan of the to come of by the coalescence along the way.

BUT that doesn't mean you won't suffer some consequences if you just do stuff w.o really thinking or worrying about it. and just in case.. we do have to try to get a stable future.. we need to invest ourselves on it [not completely ofcourse] but .. we do need to worry about the future bcuz then will be our now<br>  sooner or later.|`|xi9YtImfaa	No, we shouldn't stop planning for the future.

pakRsmzWaa	FINDING A JOB:<br>  Agents are there to help you -- they will only make money when you make money, which means your work is their priority. Make sure you understand exactly what you want to do. TV? Movies? Musical Theater? Always know or have a few comedic and dramatic monologues, and if you're a singer have songs that show different sides of your voice. Preparation really matters, as annoying as it sounds.<br>  Don't forget to be polite and show off your talents. You are a great actor/actress. If they don't see it, somebody else will!<br>  <br>  READING OVER A SCRIPT:<br>  Try to imagine you are the character. For each line, write what you are trying to convey with the line. (like: "invoke curiosity," or "make my sister feel guilty"). The great thing about humans is that when we think about what we are feeling, we don't even have to try to say it that way, it will just come out. So instead of concentrating on how loud you are, think about the emotion behind it. It will come out more believable.<br>  <br>  ACTING A SCENE:<br>  Don't sway your body. When you are talking to someone, do you sway back and forth like you are nervous? No. You walk when you say something that requires walking. Do the same with reading a scene. Walk with purpose and with reason. If bidding a partner goodbye, turn away as if to go. If you are offended, BE OFFENDED. The most important part of acting is embodying the character. You can take a million classes and improve technique, but if you can't feel the character, you won't be successful.<br>  Speak clearly and loudly. Enunciate. React to the scene. If you are reading from a script, try glancing at your lines before you read them and then saying them as if you memorized them. Also, if you are in a scene with other people, and they are exchanging dialogue and you have a lull without talking, REACT. If your two best friends were arguing in front of you, you would be making faces, or attempting to interject. Do the same in a scene, and then when the time comes to deliver your line, you'll understand the context better.<br>  <br>  AUDITIONS:<br>  Speak clearly, whether you are singing or acting, and lose yourself. The "fourth wall" is an actor's best friend. You are not embarassing yourself when you are the character -- you can't even see the director or the casting director watching you, because you aren't in an audition room. You are Character X, in Scene Y, feeling Emotion Z. I feel like the most important advice is LOSE YOURSELF IN THE MOMENT. Be the character!<br>  Learn to deal with rejection. You will not always get the part. If you practice, and work a million hours a day, you will still get rejected at some point. But remember that if every person quit after their first rejection, there would be no actors. It's about improving and accepting.|`|VW2atwU3aa	Feel the part. you must know what the character is doing before entering the scene and what has just happened to him/her. also, emotion and projection is key. if no one can hear you or see your face in theatre, people will easily loose interest. you must also be willing to spend lots of time at practices. at auditions, relax. you always do better when relaxed.|`|2pQUMKb2aa	Discover what acting you want to do first. Then find local shows, acting camps, or schools for that particular section of acting. Then after a while, you will start to build a resume. If you want to persue acting you then must get headshots, and make a solid resume. You can then send that to agents and keep practicing

tTaDBaM4aa	Keep playing what you have for now and save some more money. The price range you are speaking of spending will only buy a below average guitar at best.  It will only be slightly better than what you are now playing.  When you get to about a $1000.00 you could pick up a Gibson Les Paul studio or something similar. This is kind of the entry level on the better quality guitars.  Remember this though great electric sounds come from not only good guitars but also from good amps and good effects as well.  My experience with inexpensive gear is that you can never get anything for it when and if you ever decide to sell it.  Save and spend the extra for better quality gear and you will never be disappointed.  Good Luck!|`|KBBonf97aa	The best thing you could do is go to a guitar store and test drive a bunch of different guitars, since each one will have its own feel.  In your price range, you'll find no shortage of guitars.  But since some will have thinner necks and lower action than others and some are designed for playing specific genres of music, you can't really know which one is right for you until you play a bunch of them.  I've always been partial to Ibanez guitars and basses, which are built like rocks, sound great, and are often nicer than instruments costing twice as much.  But since guitars are very personal and one person's dream guitar is another's nightmare, you'll be better equipped to decide after you play a lot of different brands.<br>  <br>  If you want to do some research, Musician's Friend is a great resource.  You can search by brand, price or customer rating.  Guitarists also post reviews that can be a huge help in determining which guitars play and sound great and which ones have problems.  Here's a link:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/electric-guitars/solid-body" rel="nofollow">http://guitars.musiciansfriend.com/elect...</a><br>  <br>  A two-year-old guitar still has decades of useful life, so don't let its age be a factor in deciding to buy a new guitar.  But most guitarists like to add a new instrument to the corral every now and then, so if you're wanting a new guitar and buying one won't put you in dire financial straits, welcome to the family!  Since every guitar sounds and plays differently, you can always justify adding another one to your collection.  Just choose guitars that feel comfortable and natural in your hands and you'll never regret buying them.  Good luck!
0xekiwHQaa	Through the eyes of Bruno, a naive nine-year-old raised in a privileged household by strict parents whose expectations included good manners and unquestioning respect for parental authority, the author describes a visit from the Fury and the familys sudden move from Berlin to a place called Out-With in Poland. There, not 50 feet away, a high wire fence surrounds a huge dirt area of low huts and large square buildings. From his bedroom window, Bruno can see hundreds (maybe thousands) of people wearing striped pajamas and caps, and something made him feel very cold and unsafe. Uncertain of what his father actually does for a living, the boy is eager to discover the secret of the people on the other side. He follows the fence into the distance, where he meets Shmuel, a skinny, sad-looking Jewish resident who, amazingly, has his same birth date. Bruno shares his thoughts and feelings with Shmuel, some of his food, and his final day at Out-With, knowing instinctively that his father must never learn about this friendship.

Sancho is the opposite because he is driven by the basic needs of food and wealth, while DQ is driven by glory and chivalry.  Sancho acts as DQ's common sense, like when he ties Rocinante's legs together so that DQ won't attack the mills at night.<br>  I read this book a long time ago, so i'm having trouble being specific for you, but I hope it helps.

wX0rAXOYaa	Christy M is right. A B.A. in philosophy won't be enough to help you with a career that will pay the bills. An M.A. or some graduate degree will most likely be necessary. One easy transition from B.A.-level philosophy to graduate-level degree in a related field is political science, especially political philosophy. With that type of degree you could do more; however, the catch is landing a job after the completion of an M.A. or Ph.D. that will pay the bills. As in all other fields, a great deal of luck in needed in order to be successful. <br>  <br>  If you need any more advice on this, a good place to find other points of view is at the forum of the Chronicle of Higher Education. The forum itself is free to join, though many of the articles of the site are only available to subscribers.

I like that fact that i can read it and find something that i had never noticed almost every time.<br>  I enjoy it for the the sarcasm that you mentioned (love the sarcasm) and i enjoy it for the understanding it gave me of emotional growth (or what can happen when that growth has been stunted). It can make me laugh and cry within the same page.<br>  J.D. Salinger made a beautiful story and he made me want to write :)|`|0xekiwHQaa	Yeah, haha. I should probably reread it again because I didn't like it too much either. I mean, it's a good book but I think it was just the character of Holden that bothered me. I didn't really like him.

I don't know, he had this "I'm over it, smart alec, whatever" type of personality. :P<br>  <br>  Not appealing to me as a character.|`|eo0DKI0qaa	I read it for school and I loved it- although it was after reading great expectations and anything- even twilight(shudder from awfulness of name) would have been better|`|2DAfAjv2aa	I didn't like the beginning, but the ending brought me to tears. The part when Phoebe ran across the street to meet Holden, telling him she was going with him was really touching.|`|2VtDIQrvaa	i'm in 8th grade and i had to read it for english but i didn't enjoy that much either. i think holden was too negative and repetitive. i think it was sweet though and creative but i absolutely hated the ending because it left me a lot of unanswered questions. but did you notice the meaning of holden caulfield's name? if you didn't it was holden as in "hold in" and caul in caulfield used to mean baby back in the day when he wrote the book. so it's basically hold in baby field ... that might not make a lot of sense but when you think about it it does because holden wanted to be the catcher in the rye. i just thought that was very interesting :)|`|djpNBBUDaa	I love Holden Caulfield! To quote himself about the book "What really knocks me out is a book, when you're all done reading it, you wished the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it."|`|b0AgmYVdaa	the beginning was confusing but all in all the book had a good moral to it =]|`|SkHoZDWPaa	NO, it's not good.

DQAIzftdaa	The common people or the diplomatic circle? At the time, the Japanese were largely considered "white" by the upper-class circles since they quickly Westernized with the Meiji period and looked "civilized" to Europe and America compared to the "barbaric" Chinese (of whom America already had an uneasy relationship with post-Gold Rush). Their defeat of Russia in the Russo-Japanese War solidified their acceptance into the highest European circles, particularly when Britain made their first bid to break their "splendid isolation" by making a treaty with them.<br>  <br>  However, this was still the time of the "Yellow Peril" and just as today, many people think all Asians look alike, I'm sure the Japanese were still looked upon askance since they weren't European. But, many did consider Japanese immigrants more desirable than Chinese at the time.<br>  <br>  As for what T.R. had to do with it, he brokered the peace treaty between Russia and Japan in the aftermath of the war.

ZUuFV8Ysaa	According to the Ptolemaic model, everything in the universe -- the Sun, planets, stars -- revolved around the Earth.

Also teasing the bull with the red cloth, then eventualy and very sadly kill it with a spear :[<br>  <br>  Spain once had a great Empire, and owned much of south america, thats why most mexicans and other south americans speak spanish and are called hispanic.<br>  Spain had a big war with England, England wich was prodistant, spain went to war with england, The Spanish Almada (spanish fleet of ships) wich was much bigger then the english navy and was much more powerfull, The spansh almada was the biggist and strongist navy in the world. But the English crushed the spanish almada at sea, dispite being weaker, England made a heroic victory and smashed the spanish almada to bits. Spain never properly recoverd, and England became the ruler of the seas, England under rule of queen elizabth robed spanish ships coming from south america to spain from there gold.<br>  <br>  Hope i helped :]

In theory, Canada and Australia can proclaim themselves republics and still stay in the Commonwealth (Sri Lanka, Trinidad & Tobago, etc. did), but unlike these small nations where the majority is non-white and thus not likely to have much affection for an European king, republicanism has small-time support.<br>  <br>  Canada was incorporated as a home rule nation in 1867, Australia in 1901.|`|AA12305050	Australia is NOT under British rule.<br>  <br>  The states of Australia used to be colonies until they voted for independence in 1900 which was instigated on January, 1st, 1901. Since then Australia had self rule only taking part in Britain's and the "Empire's" defence in WW1 and WW2 more out of a sense of duty than anything else. After WW2 Australia's attitude was outrightly more independent.<br>  <br>  Australia is a "Constitutional Monarchy" which means they CHOOSE to retain the British monarch as head of state but Australia's constitution actually specifies how much power the monarch has. Essentially the monarch, who is represented by the Governor General, is only a ceremonial figurehead and has no actual power in the running of the country.|`|DheJq6RJaa	Australia is still technically under British rule but the queen doesn't do anything. <br>  What is the point of Queens anyway? they don't rule or anything they just wave get money and look pretty (sometimes.)|`|MXpW48lFaa	Australia is still in the British Rule.

KHSOVxViaa	Scotland didn't become bankrupt, but it was severely weakened financially by the Darien colony fiasco.<br>  <br>  The two countries had already been governed by the same monarch for about 100 years, and had grown closer in terms of trade, travel and culture.  It would have been unthinkable for one country to invade another which had the same monarch, and relations between the two were better than they had previously been.  Previous English attempts to invade Scotland and vice versa in earlier centuries had always led to disaster.<br>  <br>  There had already been several attempts to pass Acts of Union before, but all had failed.  There were continuing debates between pro- and anti-incorporationists covering many issues, such as the economy, trade, tarriffs, and the future of the monarchy.  In the end, the pro-incorporationists in both parliaments won out, and the 1707 Acts of Union came to pass.<br>  <br>  The United Kingdom was born.|`|e53470e0994050b004790b633a444bd4aa	And also bloodless.

4253fb6106243c0983e2542e5a7a5adaaa	People use the terms interchangeably.  They are both technically called "Serigraphy".<br>  <br>  "SILK screen" it was called because the screens were originally made of silk fabric.  Later, synthetic materials were used and silk was no longer part of the process therefore just 'Screen" printing after that.<br>  <br>  The process uses low-viscosity ink, not paint.  The light you speak of is used for 2 parts of the process - now this is going back to the 90s when I was in college for my Bachelor's in print tech and Print mgt. - first, the screen is stretched across a frame (just like you'd secure a new screen on a screen door).  A liquid emulsion is mixed and applied to the screen (in college is was really icky green-colored stuff).  The emulsion dries then you attach the negative or positive in the proper place to the coated screen, expose it to UV light.  The exposed portion hardens and the unexposed portion does not.  You rinse away the unexposed portion.  Then you place the screen on a substrate - paper, shirt, jacket, etc - and you squeegee the proper color ink through the screen.  The ink goes through the rinsed-away areas creating an image on the substrate.  After the screen is lifted, the ink is usually cured with UV Light to make it fast and Voila!, you're done - or you add the next color.<br>  <br>  In college, this was GREAT FUN - I loved it and my projects usually consisted of many, many colors.  I did two projects for friends in school.  One was red jackets with metallic ink image on the back for a friend who owned a car restoration shop.  The other was for a very good friend of mine who raced Arabian horses - she drew a picture of about 8 colors and I silk screened this on a bunch of pink satin jackets.  It looked really cool!.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question|`|645f18865ac05bd21df6fca545da961daa	screen printing is the same as print screening per say, when you mention photo emulsion, that is different method of applying artwork onto screen prior to screening to transfer, <br>  so you have a design, place the design over a screen with this emulsion and place in sunlight/ ultraviolet light, and where light contacts emulsion, it hardens, where you place artwork, stays moist, then you remove art template and glass cover, then rinse out design in screen for printing, <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.t-shirtforums.com/graphics-design-help/t1936.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.t-shirtforums.com/graphics-de...</a><br>  <br>  emulsion method<br>  <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Photo-emulsion-Screen-Printing/" rel="nofollow">http://www.instructables.com/id/Photo-em...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.ehow.com/how_10855_expose-photo-emulsion.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ehow.com/how_10855_expose-pho...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_emulsion" rel="nofollow">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photo_emul...</a><br>  <br>  basic glue/ filler /paint  technique,<br>  <a href="http://community.livejournal.com/craftgrrl/3674467.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.livejournal.com/craftgr...</a><br>  <a href="http://craftytutorials.blogspot.com/2008/08/low-tech-screen-printing-tutorial-cheap.html" rel="nofollow">http://craftytutorials.blogspot.com/2008...</a><br>  <a href="http://mamallama.smugmug.com/gallery/2131808/1#110385212_mmZMX" rel="nofollow">http://mamallama.smugmug.com/gallery/213...</a><br>  <br>  ..

But, also what I find... (SORRY IF YOU DON'T WANT TO LISTEN, DISREGARD THIS BUT I'M TRYING TO HELP) is that she has no need to feel so panicky. I would maybe change it to She didn't, I climbed up the stairs, my legs felt as if they were blocks of cement I had to drag up the steps. I knocked on her door before I entered, maybe she was chaining. I pushed the door lightly when she didn't answer. She wasn't there. Her bed was still made, the sheets still laid over the mattress smoothly. I made my way to my room, nope, not there either. The bathroom was empty too. I made my way back down the staircase, feeling a little panicky...<br>  <br>  I don't think my version is very good, but do you get what I'm saying, be a little more descriptive. I know if I came home and my mother didn't come to the door, I wouldn't be worried. After I combed throu the first floor, I'd be like, okay, I know the house would feel eiry and alone, so Id start to get panicky, and then afeter i couldn't find her in the rest of the hous Id be calling her. Id be calling her from the begining! You know...|`|jqyTUuPHaa	I would change Odette.  That name is too pretty to belong to someone from the way you describe her.

Your hands just sort of do it....|`|pT6ujgA8aa	The best thing to do when you go about learning piano is not figuring out whether you are left brain dominant or right brain dominant, but to start taking lessons and PRACTICE. You begin at the beginning and learn one step at a time. A piano teacher will know how to teach you how to read music and build coordination all at the same time! Most importantly, don't get discouraged. If learning piano is really something you want to do, you should go for it!

When you try to analyze something too much, you're using your left side of the brain which is more analytical.  To use your right side, you must not think too much about it, and just draw it how you see it.  Concentrate on the shapes, the colors, the texture or what ever you're trying to put onto paper.  Break the shapes down if you have to.  Hopefully this will help you because it helps me when I just can't get it right.  Good luck.|`|AA11641926	i think it is inborn talent. because I know people say that u can do anything if u try hard. but some talents are unique and that is why everyone cannot become artist.

For example, good art doesn't have to be an accurate representation of a real object. If you look at a drawing after you have done it you should be able to compare it with the original object, and see where it is similar and where it is different.  You may be drawing the wrong objects for you, using the wrong techniques or using the wrong materials.  Experiment, and all the while you'll be improving while developing new skills and finding out what your best at.  Don't draw the same thing every day.  The best way to learn is to practice and experiment.  Eventually you'll find something that works for you.|`|uYz8ipcJaa	Q1. Do you like making art?

UNrnMt3Vaa	For the adoption process the couple is an extremely young lady (22) and her husband (39) wish to adopt the child. The pregnant girl is delighted to find the perfect family who qualifies for the adoption, she develops a strong bond with the family. She decides on going through the process and giving her baby up for adoption. Just when she thought everything was going well ( she's almost due) the pregnant girl is told that her baby has a chance of having a hearing disability(Or any other mild disability) since it runs in her ex's family. Although the pregnant girl is a little disappointed, she drives home from the doctor's office assuming that the adoptive parents will understand. When she gets around telling them she finds out a week later (after having the baby) she finds out that the adoptive parents dropped out last minute and opted for another child. Betrayed she confronts the parents that now want nothing to do with her. Now the pregnant girl is stuck with her newborn child and has no nursery and no stable job to support the child and cannot go to collage.<br>  <br>  Yeah this is my idea hope you like it.|`|0364FKU6aa	she shuld keep the baby and become a prostitute to pay for it.<br>  or the baby daddys parents want to adopt her baby.<br>  ... dang i would read that **** haha|`|rt30mwXbaa	she and the princible's son should start going out and he offers to help support the baby because he wants to help her through this? idk.

Maybe slaves to what's popular if you are stupid enough not to have your own opinions. As for people deciding not to work, we would probably all die. Humans need stress to be mentally health and happy. Obviously, too much stress is not good for our body's', likewise, too little stress is not good for us. We need to be challenged and stimulated by our environment in order to continue to grow mentally. Living with out technology would be vastly harder in different ways, physical stress and discomfort plus people would not live as long as they do today. Gathering every thing we need from nature is hard because everything we need is not always available when we need it. Then when we do get what we need, it sometimes has to be processed as in the case of soap. Back when American was first being colonized people had to boil a certain plant to make soap, it took hours and was extremely hot and smelly. As far as I know there is no other way to make soap from nature. So, basically no it isn't better to stop working, it isn't easier to gather everything from nature with out technology.

j5Apt8hWaa	Your calculations are a little off.<br>  <br>  You need to multiply the focal length by 1.5.

XNNjFb4Laa	The Cecchetti method is a strict training system with special concern for anatomy within the confines of classical ballet technique, and seeks to develop the essential characteristics of dance in its students through a rigid training regime. The goal is for the student to learn to dance by studying and internalizing the basic principles, in an effort to become self-reliant rather than imitating the movements executed by their teacher.<br>  The method traditionally has seven grades with examinations up to diploma level.<br>  <br>  The Vaganova (the most common type of Russian ballet) method is considered to be very clean, with precise movements that express clean lines yet softness underneath. Even though a Vaganova-trained dancer would be very strong and clean, she/he would still be soft and perform well on stage without the robotic stiffness sometimes attributed with American-trained dancers. Russian-trained dancers are some of the best because of their clean lines, strong yet subtle movements and dazzling bravado.<br>  <br>  The "école Fran?aise" (French school of ballet, French style), is characterized by an emphasis on precision, elegance, and sobriety.<br>  <br>  The Balanchine Method is a ballet technique developed by choreographer George Balanchine and initially used at the New York City Ballet. It requires extreme speed, very deep plie, unconventional arms and hands, and emphasis on lines, especially in decale. En-dehors pirouettes are often taken from a 4th position (legs) with straightened back leg and extended front arm (i.e., a lunge, as opposed to a plie). Also notable is the distinctive arabesque, with the dancer's hip opened towards the audience while the side arm is pressed back, using a spiral to create the illusion of a longer, higher arabesque line. The overall illusion of the Balanchine Method is that dancers are utilizing more space in less time: speed, height, length and a syncopated musicality are created.<br>  <br>  Hope this answers your question somewhat :)

eZLZ327Caa	Hm...you'd probably like Jodi Picoult.  Her books deal with plenty of different issues, and a lot of the 18-25ish-year-olds I know like them.  I don't feel the urge to read them as they sound a tad preachy, but hey, give them a try.<br>  <br>  An absolutely amazing book is The Historian by Elizabeth Kostova.  It's about the search for Dracula, who's alive and well.  It jumps from three different time frames and mixes a teensy bit of romance, a bit of horror, a bit of adventure, and a lot of something indescribable.<br>  <br>  Eleanor Rigby by Douglas Coupland is also quite good, and is a bit easier to read.  A single woman in her 30s is contacted by a young man who ends up being the son she had at 16.  She has to deal with his illness and other typical 30-year-old woman stuff.  It's been a while since I've read it.  It has a lot of sarcasm and dry wit, so you'll either love it or hate it.<br>  <br>  The Handmaid's Tale by Margaret Atwood is also a great choice.  It's set in a utopian USA, where the women have essentially lost all of their rights (they aren't even allowed to read--signs have even been replaced with pictures).  The only thing women are good for is giving birth.  This is an awesome book on so many levels.<br>  <br>  Who Has Seen the Wind by W. O. Mitchell is the story of a young boy growing up in the prairies.  He pretty much questions everything--death, the meaning of life, religion, etc.  He's faced with many painful obstacles, but it's written with dashes of humour added in.  It's one of my top 5 favourite books.|`|TlCD6Jesaa	Not all teen books are just about romance and petty stuff.<br>  <br>  Try these:<br>  My Mother the  Cheerleader, Sharenow (it's not about cheerleading it's about school integration in the south.)<br>  <br>  Does my Head Look Big in This?  Abdel-Fattah, this seems to start out about self-centered teen stuff, but goes into a lot of different themes that have much more weight.<br>  <br>  Life as we Knew it, Pfeffer<br>  Daniel Half Human, Chotjewitz<br>  <br>  Absolutely True Diary of a Part Time Indian, Alexie<br>  Bad, Ferris<br>  Armegeddon Summer, Yolen<br>  Shattering Glass, Giles<br>  Of Sound Mind, Ferris<br>  Speak, Laurie Halse Anderson (and other books by her)<br>  Godless, Peter Hautman|`|DDTiZRvzaa	My Sister's Keeper:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sister's_Keeper" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/My_Sister's...</a><br>  <br>  The Boyfriend List:<br>  <a href="http://www.teenreads.com/reviews/0385732074.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.teenreads.com/reviews/0385732...</a><br>  <br>  The Twilight Series (don't kill me!)<br>  <br>  The Luxe Series|`|ohj5sRpsaa	I agree, Angus, Thongs and Full Frontal Snogging is funny if you are looking for a relaxing read. If you want something a little more serious, but still pretty funny is Sushi for Beginners by Marian Keyes.<br>  <br>  The Time Traveler's Wife is one of my absolute favorites. It is an unconventional love story that centers on a man with a strange genetic disorder that causes him to unpredictably time travel, and his wife, an artist who has to cope with his frequent absences and dangerous experiences. <br>  <br>  It's nice. I also would suggest some novels by Jodi Picoult, such as My Sister's Keeper.|`|EzFzZsQOaa	Let's see, I read Twilight and that's a good romance novel, also read a book called a dance for three by Louise Plummer which is about a fifteen year old getting pregnant...don't worry, this is NOT a romance book by any means.

Max, 14, and her adopted family–Fang and Iggy, both 13, Nudge, 11, Gazzy, 8, and Angel, 6–were all created as experiments in a lab called the School. Jeb, a sympathetic scientist, helped them escape and, since then, they've been living on their own. The Erasers have orders to kill them so the world will never find out they exist. Max's old childhood friend, Ari, now an Eraser leader, tracks them down, kidnaps Angel, and transports her back to the School to live like a lab rat again. The youngsters are forced to use their special talents to rescue her as they attempt to learn about their pasts and their destinies. <br>  <br>  Marked ( Book 1) House of Night series by P.C. Cast & Kristin Cast<br>  In 16-year-old Zoey Redbird's world, vampyres not only exist but are also tolerated by humans. Those whom the creatures "mark" as special enter the House of Night school where they will either become vampyres themselves, or, if their body rejects the change, die. To Zoey, being marked is truly a blessing, though she's scared at first. She has never fit into the human world and has always felt she is destined for something else. Her grandmother, a descendant of the Cherokee, has always supported her emotionally, and it is she who takes the girl to her new school. But even there the teen stands apart from the others. Her mark from the Goddess Nyx is a special one, showing that her powers are very strong for one so young. At the House of Night, Zoey finds true friendship, loyalty, and romance as well as mistrust and deception.<br>  <br>  Blue Bloods Series by Melissa De La Cruz- The Blue Blood Series by Melissa De La Cruz- About a group of Vampires called Blue Bloods who try to do good in the world, only to realize that one of their own has turned from them.<br>  <br>  Eternal By: Cynthia Smith-******<br>  At last, Miranda is the life of the party: all she had to do was die.

Her family disapproves but she is head over paws. With growing tension within her pack and her lack of control over her own abilities, she wonders if her boy will love her, or more importantly, if he will survive loving her.

AA11265941	This is a pretty straightforward small poem in which the author is saying that a carefree child playing at the shore, who hasn't yet experienced the harsh things in life, doesn't hear anything ominous in the sounds of the wind and waves, implying, of course, that a person experienced in life finds these sounds ominous, symbolic of the rigors and hurts of life. The poem is notable for the meter, rhymes and word choices, which all reinforce the described scene of a shore where the waves are pounding and the wind is howling. There is also a nice play between the innocent and fragile child and the destructive forces of wind and waves.
CRuxWsi0aa	Do you mean difference between book and movie?<br>  The movie with Gwyneth Paltrow pretty much stuck to the story, as far as I can remember, though it cut out some of the unnecessary parts of the story. For example we saw a lot less of the Elton-Emma-Harriet triangle. Also, Mr. Knightley does NOT look 40 in the movie.<br>  The movie seemed more modernized to me but you can make up your mind on whether you agree with me or not on that.<br>  Great movie, though, may watch it again.

XTmiI44laa	First find out as much as you can from parents and grandparents, what they did for a living is very important as there are lots of people with the same name. then go here it's free<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.familysearch.org/eng/default....</a>|`|AA12343309	My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene..." rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|7ONKVbbiaa	www.cyndislist.com<br>  is a collection of thousands of websites. Your ancestors can be at MANY locations, but the key thing is to define specifics of what they might have been. A library is a site with genealogy.. a map is useful. Your most important criteria is TIME and LOCATION. <br>  Your question is like asking "I want to buy something, do you know where I should go?" Expect to be asked WHAT YOU WANT TO BUY, then someone can tell you different places that carry that thing. You wouldn't be looking for pizza at autozone.
mzNLfY4Caa	AMAZING!! <br>  <br>  There is really nothing you can add, although If it were me who was drawing this picture. I would do a very dark sky to contrast the buildings and also "pop out" batman and superman. You can do a solid dark sky, or a crosshatch dark sky. If you do the dark sky you can add in some soft clouds. But make it a night scenery. That is my best idea. Even if you decide not to add a sky or something, it looks finished, and very detailed. <br>  <br>  You have talent! =]|`|xjBFwsVMaa	Looks good to me. I think it needs a little bit of color though... maybe just the superheros so they pop out or something with the sky. Other than that there is nothing else I would do.

I think it is perfect the way it is|`|amcqJkWhaa	Some really dramatic clouds. <br>  So it's a really great drawing, but what is the mood or atmosphere supposed to be? It's not clear if they are enemies or allies. But, given their almost identical poses, it seems there is some parallelism going on there, so I am led to believe that they are much alike, and both good guys. But, from their attitude, it still looks like they're about to fight or something, and giving their situation, why else could they be there... <br>  And Superman and Batman seem to have different lightsources. <br>  I think your buildings are in need of some more contrast... I take it the city buildings may have some sort of symbolism, and if they don't and you just put them there, I think they could have a good potential to add a lot to the overall mood... It doesn't really fit that the 'inking' of the figures appears to be stylistic, but the background buildings are not... <br>  <br>  I suggest perhaps that you post this drawing to the Critique Center of the Forums on Conceptart.org. They can have something good to offer you, if it would be of interest of you to have more opinions from those who like to critique.|`|UIzaamJ7aa	It's actually pretty good; in the scale to 1-10, I'd give it a 7.<br>  <br>  To make it a 9 or10, you'd have to work on Superman's and Batman's face a little more...looks kind of off...

VCIZJQCJaa	here's a few examples you might consider.well brought up women,time lines of the anglo saxon woman,daily life of the anglo saxon woman,living in the world of the a/s woman,in the eyes of the a/s/ woman,survival of the a/s/ women,the feminist tradition,a rare breed Anglo-Saxon women <br>  Anglo-Saxon women’s daily activities depended greatly on her status. Traditionally, women in this period were cloth-makers and embroiderers. They would make a variety of different soft furnishings like wall-hangings, seat-covers, bedclothes and table linen. <br>  Male slaves were in charge of preparing food but serving drinks was a woman’s job. <br>  <br>  Anglo-Saxon women had a high mortality(death) rate. The most common cause of death was from pregnancy, miscarriage and childbirth. The reason suggested for this was from lack of iron. Common ailments(sicknesses) were earaches, toothaches, burns, wounds, headaches and shingles. <br>  <br>  Pregnant women in this period were advised not to eat anything too salty or sweet, not to eat pork or any other fatty food, not to drink to the point of drunkenness, not to travel, not to travel much on horseback and not to drink any strong alcoholics drinks. <br>  <br>  When a woman was going to marry another man, the soon-to-be husband had to pay “morgengifu” (a morning gift) of money or land to the woman. The woman could control the land and do what she wanted with it as she pleased. She could give it away, sell it, keep it or bequeath it. hope this helps a bit

Id suggest putting your most interesting and better pictures in there for people to see.  You have a lot of good shots of the "royal court" and there are some good angles with the buildings.|`|3mAgM405aa	Cami F's response is right on regarding any number of snap shots which represent the bulk of your photo album.  Try to cut down on those snaps and concentrate on a smaller number in which you can Photoshop edit.  Otherwise, the technical aspects of focusing and exposure-- you have pretty well mastered.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|YorMkZYAaa	I'm not feeling it one bit. It's just all over the place and has no set theme or idea. Some of your pictures are just bland and don't have much depth or feeling to them. And I can agree that having so many photos is just overdoing it. I'd say to pick up to 25 good favorites in maybe 2-3 themes (50-75 altogether) and organize accordingly. No one wants to sift through thousands of boring photos or random shots. <br>  <br>  Narrow it down and I think your shots will be much better.|`|jAwnqfBGaa	You definitely need to focus the albums if you want a good critique. Critiques are more for images that are strong on their own, or in a series, not just snapshots of things.<br>  <br>  So basically I agree with everyone else. You'll want to pick some of the stronger pieces and make them easily accessible. Then you can have separate albums for extras, or family snapshots, etc. When they are divided that way you can keep everything you want, but when people want to critique you, then they know which images/albums to look at and they won't have to sort through the family photos.|`|W82ONKCoaa	There's just too much.  One of your sets alone has over 600 images.  Now don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with being prolific.  The first thing you should learn how to do is edit.  First, there are a lot of different themes, so you could just arrange them all into their own themes or categories.  Next, you would have to weed out the shots that aren't so strong.  If you had five portfolios of 12 shots, that would be a lot easier to manage than 12 portfolios ranging from 10-700 photos each.  Then you should just say to someone something like: "what do you think of my portfolio of portraits?".  And you would get better responses from people to help you make your work better.|`|3f138f62611335ca1d21ee4e397a935caa	Good start.

All four have conference judging where you have to talk about the project with a judge. For Photo 1, 2, and 3, you need to take one picture and be able to discuss its composition and any techniques you used (rule of thirds, depth of field, etc.). For Digital Photography, you have to digitally edit a photo you have taken using a program such as Photoshop beyond cropping and red-eye reduction. The original photo need to be taped to the back of the edited photo.<br>  <br>  It depends on your specific county guidelines, as programs can vary widely.

One of the primary reasons for the British settlement of Australia was the establishment of a penal colony to alleviate pressure on their overburdened correctional facilities. Over the 80 years more than 165,000 convicts were transported to Australia. The last convicts to be transported to Australia arrived in Western Australia in 1868.|`|GaHkxtU9aa	Ok. A quick history lesson on early Australia.<br>  <br>  In 1770, Captain James Cook in his ship Endeavor discovers Australia and maps the eastern seaboard of Australia.<br>  <br>  In 1788, the English return but this time with the aim of establishing a colony. On the first transports to Australia are a mixture of officials, british soldiers, ordinary people seeking a new life, as well as convicts.<br>  <br>  The english sent prisoners - guilty of minor crimes as well as major crimes - to Australia as a kind of free labour to help build the colony - build roads, bridges, manual labour. The English mostly sent their prisoners to Australia as to free up the english prison system.<br>  <br>  While the early colony at Sydney in Botany Bay began to florish slowly, more English began to migrate with the promise of large farms and plenty of grazing. The English began to give soldiers and minor gentry large estates to open up Australia for wool - which would be sent back to England and used for uniforms and clothing - pretty much the same way that the English used the early American colonies as a cash crop.<br>  <br>  But you have to remember that in coming to Australia there were a whole range of people coming to migrate - not just convicts sent by English courts. There were doctors, pharmacists, lawyers, botanists, families fleeing persecution in England, religious people such as Catholics - a whole range of people seeking to start a new life in Australia and hoping that Australia would become a new America.<br>  <br>  By 1850, convict transports to Australia had ceased. The English did attempt to send another convict transport to Sydney in 1856, but there was massive public uproar that England continued to see Australia as adumping ground for its social and economic problems - and England ceased sending convicts to Australia.<br>  <br>  Australians forget the very important labour that convicts gave to our early colony - they built roads, houses, bridges - without their labour - their free labour - the early colonists would have found it very hard to establish the early colony and it almost ended in disaster - just the way Roanoake in america had ended up.<br>  <br>  Another important fact is that in the 1850's, England - committed to wars in Europe against Russia - began to withdraw English soldiers from Australia. While Australia complained that we were defenceless, it was a sign that we were maturing as a nation and that the remaining convicts were either given their freedom, died, or still remained in jail.|`|AA11304025	Yes - the first convict transports began arriving in the 18th century|`|lz6vAjSEaa	britian sent their prisoners there to exile|`|B6EpHU1Waa	Yes, Australia used to, essentially, be a prison camp.

VR7JfxM4aa	Not to be all linguistically picky, but churches dedicated to the Virgin Mary are Christian Churches, not "marian churches"  <br>  <br>  The dedication of churches to the Virgin Mary started in the early 5th century. They were some of the very first churches to be built after the Emperor's declaration that Christianity was a tolerated religion within the Roman Empire.  The first ones were Santa Maria in Trastavere, Santa Maria Antiqua and Santa Maria Maggiore.

AA12228381	Yes, its very possible.  Actors do 'drop offs' all the time to CD's offices.  (Most CD's have boxes in front of their offices specifically for the purpose of dropping off headshots).  There are a lot of talent actors who do not have an agent, so sending a headshot can never hurt.  If they think you have the look and talent for what they are casting, then yes, you might get called in, with or without an agent.  I know this because I've done it.

Dont ever practice the dance and be lazy. The more you get used to the dance, you will be able to hear the music from any spot and know exactly where you are in the dance. If you happen to forget the dance move, start freestyling. Since you said you have trouble with free-styling, just start hitting different dance moves that go with the music. Make sure all your moves are short and you will be okay. <br>  <br>  Always smile and do facials! And if you blank out, dont freak out or look like you forgot. Just go with the flow right after and try to pick up the dance moves later in the song. <br>  <br>  <br>  Good Luck!|`|Imx0EvzDaa	FORGET ABOUT THEM WATCHN AND JUST TELL YOUR SELF YOU CAN DO IT!!!!!!!<br>  don't blank your self out blank them out and pretend that your in your room by your self dancing to the music you can do it if you believe in your self!!!!!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  YOU KNOW YOU CAN DO IT<br>  WORK IT GIRL!!!!!!!!!!!!

YkZa3SXyaa	If you want to know yourself you probably have to lose it first.|`|AA10729675	Happy Hiram is right as usual.  No one knows oneself because the subconscious mind makes sure to be hidden.  As long as we do not know that part of oneself, we know almost nothing of ourselves.<br>  We can meditate ad nauseam, and do introspection ad libitum, that part will not reveal itself, otherwise it would not be "sub-conscious".<br>  So, whatever we may know of oneself, we have to take care that we always feel comfortable with, otherwise something is wrong with the subconscious and it will communicate it to us in many various ways.<br>  There is only one little thing that works: the color cards: you have two identical sets of cards with many different colors.  One set shows the colors and you pick one -consciously.  The other set does not show the colors because the cards are like up side down.  You pick one - that is your subconscious choosing.  If both cards have the exact same color (tone and nuance) you have only this little piece of information: both parts agree within yourself.  That is it. It is already a lot because you know that you are balanced and in agreement with your subconscious mind.  But that is it.  I saw that happen twice (with the cards).|`|FoIxsunVaa	Know thyself is a crock. No one can know themselves.|`|ZJ2k7Ynqaa	Read the Bible, New Testament first.

So even under very favorable auspices, what actually<br>  happens is bound to disappoint you, since part of the illusory childhood world is the desire for<br>  instant gratification, the total lack of patience.|`|GSf09ALBaa	What you just asked is an oxymoron.  If it is reality it cannot be an illusion.  And fantasy is not reality.

Reality is what allows fantasy to progress to as real as an illusion will allow. Where's there's a will, there's a way. Fantasy once gilded in 3d, a reality that exists only because of audacious dreams, fantasy becomes hypnotically sensuous. Fantasy is to dreams as  dancing is to revolution. It's not a matter of factual intepretation of reality, rather the willingness to engage an unknown, fantasy, which can become very much a reason to live. There's no shortage of fellow travelers, and fantasy support groups all failed. Eternal Vigilance.|`|NC0GOCo4aa	Mmm Lets see,<br>  <br>  The world of reality consists of the facts.<br>  <br>  The human equivilant or interpretation of those facts<br>  <br>  becomes the subjective reality of the person doing the interpretation.<br>  <br>  Fantasy is creating stories from either, or changing the interpretation.<br>  <br>  Cheers bluerobbinflying|`|LOfZNNdfaa	I don't know what you mean by reality is an illusion.

RxHb1P4Faa	Usually a series is more than three books. If there are only two books, the second one would usually be called a sequel, companion, saga, etc.<br>  <br>   If there are three, then yes, trilogy. A general definition of a trilogy is having three books. I guess there can be different goals, but some continue through with one major goal and subgoals in between. They all have to connect in some way though. So I guess your trilogy can have one goal for each of the three books. I know of some authors who were planning to create a trilogy, but their books didn't do so well so they had to stop at book two.<br>  <br>  I've also seen some books where the author first planned to make it a trilogy, but then they decided to change it to a series. (Since their trilogy did so well). I've also saw some that have a series and then connect some other companion books and trilogys to them. You could look at Ender's game by Orson Scott Card and see how he puts the different books together.<br>  <br>  A sequel is anything that continues, so I guess anything goes. In the Spy High Books by AJ Butcher, the author made a series (I think about 6 books) then wrote a Series 2 to explain more about the characters. Same for the Daughters of the Moon and Sons of the night books by Lynne Ewing.<br>  <br>  Since there are so many different variations, I wouldn't worry too much about being strict on what you're going to call it or what you're going to write it about to match the whole series thing.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6gIolMulaa	Yes, a series is usually more than three books. Also, you can have a different goal for each book, but most series tend to have one absolute goal for the entire series while conquering smaller goals in each book. It all depends on the approach you would like to take in your book. If you're still undecided when you begin writing the first of your trilogy possibly just sequel, then set one major goal and then create smaller less important goals that help accomplish the major goal. Good luck with your book(s)! I hope I helped at least minutely!|`|92c0c9e5d7ee893f8f8042c1689ff773aa	Yes, each book can have different goals and such as long as the characters are the same, I'm pretty sure it would still be a part of the series.  If you were to write two books with the same characters then yes the second one would be called a sequal.|`|wKSvnna2aa	LOTR is not a trilogy by the way. It's one huge book.

fWWYc2UZaa	why are they named after ... like ... minerals? haha. kind of cheesey if you ask me. try being a little more creative, such as... only using half the word. or tweaking it a little. like instead of sapphire, use saphina. something cute and not corny and overused. i don't know what you'd use for ruby though. also, don't use words like "beautiful brunette girl" when describing another girl. do you think of other girls your age as "beautiful" ? i'd think rather "she was really pretty, and her chestnut hair was really shiny." something kind of like that. this girl is not any old boring narrarator, she's a character, so give her some personality. not just some lame-*** description. haha no offense. also try thinking of other ways to say things. think about each sentence and think of the different ways you could portray that. then choose the best one, and at the end of your paragraph, see if it meshes together well. if it doesn't, and sounds too thesaurus-like, tone it down a bit. be careful how you select. well, you have a lot to work on so get on it!|`|2QTktDQsaa	I like it, and I want to read more.|`|PDJJd8oEaa	Yes i like it ! is this the one were they are from Ashbrooke Falls and they have supernatural powers ?   <br>  <br>  <br>  i like it ! it is very good !|`|9AI4TECmaa	yes. its a really good beggining, it makes want to read more, to see wat happens.

1DySEaRraa	Title Suggestions<br>  1- Hello? <br>  2- Anybody Home?<br>  <br>  <br>  Story<br>  You wander around the house a little confused after you see no ones home, check all the bedrooms to find the beds are all made and looks like no one was in them the night before. You get a little scared but ignore it and watch TV. The TV doesn't distract you see you call mom or dads cell phone. You hear it ringing from their bedroom. Your heart rate picks up and you try to delude yourself into thinking they just forgot it. You hear a knock at the door and you go stiff. You hold your breath as you go to the stairs and look at the front door at the bottom. You slowly go down the stairs thinking of all the crazy possibilities of who it could be. You stand in front of the door scared out of your mind then slowly open it. No one. Your relieved and close the door. The phone rings. You scream. You answer the phone and its your mom screaming for you to get out of the house. Your confused. The phone call is cut off. You turn to run out of the house and there's a man with a knife.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  lol I think I got a little to into it. Hope it helped. =]|`|X3a9VMMeaa	i would have it that you walked outside and you were in a different country. but your house is the same and everything its just like it got picked up and moved to france or something<br>  <br>  then you go to the police station and the cop is your dad, the nurse at the hospital is your mom, but they all dont know you and speak the native tongue.. <br>  <br>  hope that helps lol|`|5eUoENzuaa	Before you start writing, keep this format in mind:<br>  <br>  Orphan: Give the readers a reason to like the character, and to even feel sorry for him. (In this case, the reason to feel sorry for him would be because his family is gone, without a trace.)<br>  <br>  Wanderer: Your character doing nothing of too much interest, for example, if the whole population have vanished expect for him, he might be running wild and having a good time living without rules!<br>  <br>  Warrior: He discovers something bad, or troublesome, and tries to fix it. (Maybe he finds out why the people are all gone from the Earth.)<br>  <br>  Martyr: He suceeds, but perhaps with a few problems. (This is where the character would recieve some happiness and reward)<br>  <br>  That is just a general frame of writing, mind you. But I hope it helps!|`|ymx1z7hdaa	I would suggest recording everything in your day from the moment you wake up (i.e. the sounds, the smells, the conversations you hear when you wake up, what you hear at school, etc.).  Then, imagine those things being taken away.  How would you feel?  What would be your initial reaction?  Would you like this?  Why?  Would you not like this?  Why?  Then take it from there.  Evoke all of the senses in your process.  <br>  <br>  If you did that, I really think you would have a strong paper from the prompt. :]
394ff47f78f7ed3b7394395aaf14b639aa	I've tried really hard to appreciate Kerouac, but I just can't  get into his writing. I read On the Road recently, and to me the story was parched, it just seem like an endless succession of events, and I didn't get a real story of self discovery or the lack there of out of it, I wasn't ignited to wander. I feel a bit like a literary degenerate because of the fact that I can't appreciate Kerouac, so if anything I need help discovering a love for Kerouac.|`|Pejn5yb3aa	I listened to the audio version of "On The Road" by Kerouac. It was about 18 cassette tapes and I think it took me about 4 tapes before I realized that there was no plot to the story. It was just about 3 or 4  guys who did almost any thing on a whim.  The main protagonist, had nothing holding him down, and he was content with a cheap bottle of wine,  a can of beans, and what ever girl friend he had at the time. He just wanted to see every thing that there was to see all at once. He wanted to know what interested every body else.|`|doVbqo3iaa	Well, I really love his poetry (especially those American Haikus). From what I recall, the poems in Mexico City Blues are generally short, compacted with ideas on society and culture and at the same time maintaining a certain spontaneity. So no need to say I am a big fan.<br>  <br>  Big Sur would have to be my favorite. Visions of Cody is great, too|`|RC9guRCHaa	I've actually been meaning to pick up a book of his called On The Road, don't know much about it, a friend suggested it, other than that, I have not really read any of his work.

XOnSRoR2aa	The only peer editing sites I'm familiar with are Essay Judge and Calibrated Peer Review. Essay Judge is not exclusively for college students, and it's intended more for short reviews rather than editing, but I think you may still find it helpful. I'm not sure if CPR would fit your purpose because it's primarily for professors to assign essays which students will upload there and have edited by others in the class, but check out the site anyway just in case.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.EssayJudge.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.EssayJudge.com/</a><br>  <a href="http://cpr.molsci.ucla.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://cpr.molsci.ucla.edu/</a><br>  <br>  Does your college have a writing lab or a success / student center that provides academic support? Many do and they are excellent resources; some even offer online support. They should be able to evaluate your work and offer editing suggestions to you. Some public libraries also offer online support including constructive criticism for essays & research papers, but I don't know if they are for college students or just teens. I used Tutor.com for help in AP Physics, which is very a challenging college-level class, and the people were incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. They might be able to help you, too.<br>  <br>  Good luck! <br>  <br>  ~ Pax / Peace : )
kchqZjeuaa	i liked it i think you should keep writing|`|pZIiYc8baa	As an author I can tell you the quality of your work has little to do with whether or not you will keep writing. You've gotten some good feedback on it so far, positive things, and that's nice--but essentially it's something within you that determines whether or not you will write. Just read some of the questions on here about loving or hating Twilight and you'll get the idea. Basically there are people who will like your work and others who won't. But if you're anything like me writing is something you couldn't stop doing any more than you could stop breathing, thinking or eating chocolate :)|`|AA11866897	No, it's very good.

The story will be talking in past at the beginning then it switches around the time of the father's dialogue.<br>  <br>  Those are just proof reading errors that can be easily corrected.<br>  <br>  The only other rule you need to pay attention to is the repetition of words. Like "done" in the first 2 paragraphs. That word is used a few times and synonyms could be used instead to convey the same message in a more flowing pattern.

uGmEjSLDaa	(My response assumes your narrator is a he.)<br>  <br>  You're telling, and not showing. That's a basic, but fairly fixable mistake.<br>  <br>  Start the prologue with your best line: "I took the bait and became the fisherman." (Which I quite like, by the way--good turn of phrase for someone as young as you are!) Then develop a scene from there that describes HOW that happened.<br>  <br>  Make sure your narrator is describing HOW he feels. For phrases like "My face portrayed shock. I could feel it." (a run-on without punctuation, by the way), describe HOW that shock feels. Can he feel his eyes widening or his jaw growing tight? Pick a detail or two that is crucial for your narrator to notice about himself, and go with it.<br>  <br>  The 'him' and the 'her' in the preface is confusing. Make sure you tell us something about the friends. Make us care why the narrator is sacrificing himself for these two friends. As it is, they're not important enough for the narrator's action to matter. Make their survival IMPORTANT and USEFUL.<br>  <br>  The 'because of you' isn't quite as astounding as the single paragraph seems to point out that it should be--if you really need a twist ending to your prologue, I would make it pack a little more punch, by including something less expected. 'Because of your stolen TV' or 'because of your cheap wine,' off the top of my head, are two basic examples. Neither of these things seem like things that should matter enough for a life-and-death struggle--use something like that to add more of a twist.<br>  <br>  'Hopefully they would satisfy their (spelling) needs with me' implies something really sketchy and awful going on. If that's not what you mean to imply, I would make it a bit less, er, risque.<br>  <br>  The relationships are unclear: Whose son, at the end? Spell it out or you'll lose readers due to confusion at the prologue.<br>  <br>  Also, minor grammar and spelling errors (it was here, not it's here; I was sure, not I'm sure): tense shift--things like that can be fixed on a proofread.<br>  <br>  Over all, it's a good start, but there are a few points of revision.

A1iyvh29aa	I usually set an hourly rate say $30 an hour and then ad in all cost like model, travel, printing cost. Make sure even if you did not pay the model you add that price in because you are setting values for future pieces as well, when you sell a piece.  In the future you may have model cost and you don't want someone saying well He got his for $400 why is mine $600?  So charge for what it would take to reproduce the image plus an hourly wage.  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.TysonJamesPhotography.com</a>|`|JWmzdQMEaa	What I generally do when I'm trying to decide on a price for my art is start with what I think my time is worth per hour (this should depend on how much photo experience you have and what you feel that your skill level is- be realistic and objective), and then I take that dollar amount and multiply it by how much time I spent on the piece. From that base amount, you can add the cost of supplies and expenses (ie- model and printing costs). Then ask yourself if you would pay that much for the piece.
rwbtmwpPaa	From experienced People:<br>  <br>  "In getting the audition in the first place, you or your agent are going to have to submit a photo and resume to the casting director. Sometimes you'll get an open call where anybody can come down but these are the exception, not the rule. Most auditions are by invitation only.<br>  <br>  If you are called for an audition you will usually be given what are called "sides" or a few pages of a script that you will have to read at the audition. In theater you may also be required to have some kind of monologue ready.<br>  <br>  The first thing to do is read the script and prepare for the part. Find out everything you can about the character you're going to be playing. The lines aren't important yet. Just commit your focus to the character. How old, where from, how the character feels about other characters in the story. Only after you know everything you need to know about the character do you start learning your lines. Use whatever method you feel most comfortable with. You won't be required to know the whole script at the audition but be prepared.<br>  <br>  Before you go to the audition, dress for the part. Wear clothes that fit the character and the story. If you're playing a cowboy don't get dressed up in a business suit. You don't have to go out and rent spurs but wear clothes that suggest the role. Jeans and boots for this role will do fine.<br>  <br>  Warm up for the audition just like a pitcher warms up before a ball game. Do some stretches and vocal exercises. Go over your lines. Don't go in there cold. It's normal to be nervous but in preparing yourself you won't be as nervous and you'll be able to relax a bit.<br>  <br>  When you get to the audition, sign in. You may have to wait for others to read for the same part. Be patient. Avoid talking with the other actors. They will only try to distract you. Focus on what you came there to do.<br>  <br>  When actually reading for the casting director, be prepared for anything. Some may sit and chat with you a few minutes and others will just get right down to business. Forget that this is an audition. Do the performance as if you were actually in the production. You only get one chance to make a first impression. Make the director believe that you ARE the character. They want you to be the best person for the role because that means their job is completed.<br>  <br>  There are some things not to do when reading for the casting director. Don't suck up. A sincere compliment is fine but a casting director will know when you're just grovelling. Aside from shaking his hand when you enter, never touch the casting director. Finally, don't trash the office. Some hyperactive actors will actually do this in the heat of performing a physical scene. This is a definite way NOT to get the part.<br>  <br>  After you're done with your reading the director will let you know when they'll get back to you. Leave it at that. Don't make a scene. Just be professional and leave.<br>  <br>  If the casting director likes your performance you will be asked to come back. At this time there will be fewer people auditioning and more people watching your performance. Maybe some producers, directors and writers. Wear the same clothes that you wore to the first audition and put in the same performance. Don't second guess yourself. If they called you back then they liked what they saw the first time. Don't mess with success.<br>  <br>  Keep records of each audition. Make notes of what things you did and what you think you can do better the next time. If something went very well, make a note of what it was.<br>  <br>  The more auditions you do the better you will get at them."<br>  <br>  <br>  Good luck ..Break a leg ..lol|`|tkM1a0dWaa	You act out many scenarios that will show your ability.

In the series, some of the characters notice what's going through other characters' heads by watching their daemons. Like a few times, Mrs. Coulter tries to keep a poker face but her daemon gives her feelings away by getting excited and such.<br>  <br>  So, relationships might not be so complicated, or at least people might have an easier time telling when someone's lying or telling the truth. I mean if Mrs. Coulter herself is a good liar but her damen can't always control himself, wouldn't that mean that a daemon's instinct is to express? And he's not the only one who does it.<br>  <br>  Plus I'm sure that if someone had an embarassing-looking daemon, like I don't know, a hippo, I'm sure that they'd have a harder time being accepted. Part of social groups might be defined by the type of daemon one has.|`|S5324X5Saa	I think we would see less of depression and self-inflicted health problems like anorexia or bulimia or cutting. This is usually the result of wanting to fit in or wanting to have a more universal image. With daemons, we wouldn't have to fulfill the feelings of fitting in, because with a daemon you would always have someone who accepts you for you.<br>  And going back to what Lyra Wants A Grand Piano said... Bluffing and trickery would be harder, yes, but the advantages of having a daemon would be wonderful too. Illegal acts would be easier with a second set of hands, more or less.<br>  Is this making any sense?

I especially like how you start to tell a story, setting an atmosphere while involving the character, and not droning  on with meaningless drivel like the colour of his eyes, which is what most young writers initially do,  Don't worry about copyrighting though, it's not great.  <br>  <br>  <br>  Talent can only be exploited with skill and practice, so keep writing.  Equally important - read.  See how your writing stands up to what you read.  <br>  <br>  After you write a piece, read back through it and ask yourself how you might make the sentences more clear, smoother.  <br>  <br>  For example, in the following excerpt, you do not need to say "bedroom window".  Just "window" is needed because we know he's in his bedroom - he's on his bed.   I'm also not sure about "different colours", the only city I know where your window might flash different colours might be Vegas - but I might be misunderstanding what you mean.<br>  <br>  "Ari sat alone on his bed, his back against the cold concrete wall. He watched the patterns the rain reflected on the wall through the bedroom window, the city lights flashed different colours between cars driving by on the busy street, hypnotized by his own personal light show."<br>  <br>  This gets confusing.

shVgCizBaa	To Kill a Mockingbird is a Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Harper Lee published in 1960. It was instantly successful and has become a classic of modern American fiction. The novel is loosely based on the author's observations of her family and neighbors, as well as on an event that occurred near her hometown in 1936, when she was 10 years old.<br>  <br>  The novel is renowned for its warmth and humor, despite dealing with serious issues of rape and racial inequality. The narrator's father, Atticus Finch, has served as a moral hero for many readers and as a model of integrity for lawyers. One critic explained the novel's impact by writing, "In the twentieth century, To Kill a Mockingbird is probably the most widely read book dealing with race in America, and its protagonist, Atticus Finch, the most enduring fictional image of racial heroism."[1]<br>  <br>  As a Southern Gothic novel and a Bildungsroman, the primary themes of To Kill a Mockingbird involve racial injustice and the destruction of innocence. Scholars have noted that Lee also addresses issues of class, courage and compassion, and gender roles in the American Deep South. The book is widely taught in schools in English-speaking countries with lessons that emphasize tolerance and decry prejudice. Despite its themes, To Kill a Mockingbird has been subject to campaigns for removal from public classrooms. Often the book is challenged for its use of racial epithets, and writers have noticed that regardless of its popularity since its publication, some readers are displeased by the novel's treatment of black characters.<br>  <br>  Lee's novel was initially reviewed by at least 30 newspapers and magazines, whose critics varied widely in their assessments. More recently, British librarians ranked the book ahead of the Bible as one "every adult should read before they die".[2] The book was adapted into an Oscar-winning film in 1962 by director Robert Mulligan, with a screenplay by Horton Foote. Since 1990, a play based on the novel has been performed annually in Harper Lee's hometown of Monroeville, Alabama. To date, it is Lee's only published novel, and although she continued to respond to the book's impact, she refused any personal publicity for herself or the novel since 1964.------------------------------ The story takes place during three years of the Great Depression in the fictional "tired old town" of Maycomb, Alabama. The narrator, six-year-old Scout Finch, lives with her older brother Jem and their widowed father Atticus, a middle-aged lawyer. Jem and Scout befriend a boy named Dill who visits Maycomb to stay with his aunt for the summer. The three children are terrified of, and fascinated with, their neighbor, the reclusive "Boo" Radley. The adults of Maycomb are hesitant to talk about Boo and for many years, few have seen him. The children feed each other's imaginations with rumors about his appearance and reasons for remaining hidden, and they fantasize about how to get him out of his house. Following two summers of friendship with Dill, Scout and Jem find that someone is leaving them small gifts in a tree outside the Radley place. Several times, the mysterious Boo makes gestures of affection to the children, but, to their disappointment, never appears in person.<br>  <br>  Atticus is appointed by the court to defend a black man named Tom Robinson, who has been accused of raping Mayella Ewell, a young white woman. Although many of Maycomb's citizens disapprove, Atticus agrees to defend Tom to the best of his ability. Other children taunt Jem and Scout for Atticus' actions, calling him a "******-lover". Scout is tempted to stand up for her father's honor by fighting, even though he has told her not to. For his part, Atticus faces a group of men intent on lynching Tom. This danger is averted when Scout, Jem, and Dill shame the mob into dispersing by forcing them to view the situation from Atticus's and Tom's points of view.<br>  <br>  Because Atticus does not want them to be present at Tom Robinson's trial, Scout, Jem, and Dill watch in secret from the colored balcony. Atticus establishes that the accusers—Mayella and her father, Bob Ewell, the town drunk—are lying. It also becomes clear that the friendless Mayella was making sexual advances towards Tom and her father caught her in the act. Despite significant evidence of Tom's innocence, the jury convicts him. Jem's faith in justice is badly shaken, as is Atticus', when a hopeless Tom is shot and killed while trying to escape from prison.<br>  <br>  Humiliated by the trial, Bob Ewell vows revenge. He spits in Atticus' face on the street, tries to break into the presiding judge's house, and menaces Tom Robinson's widow. Finally, he attacks the defenseless Jem and Scout as they walk home from the school Halloween pageant. Jem's arm is broken in the struggle, but amid the confusion, someone comes to the children's rescue. The mysterious man carries Jem home, where Scout realizes that he is the reclusive Boo Radley.<br>  <br>  Maycomb's sheriff arrives a|`|0741081782691c4bf15f3f43c93552d6aa	The most important theme of To Kill a Mockingbird is the book's exploration of the moral nature of human beings—that is, whether people are essentially good or essentially evil. The novel approaches this question by dramatizing Scout and Jem's transition from a perspective of childhood innocence, in which they assume that people are good because they have never seen evil, to a more adult perspective, in which they have confronted evil and must incorporate it into their understanding of the world. As a result of this portrayal of the transition from innocence to experience, one of the book's important subthemes involves the threat that hatred, prejudice, and ignorance pose to the innocent: people such as Tom Robinson and Boo Radley are not prepared for the evil that they encounter, and, as a result, they are destroyed. Even Jem is victimized to an extent by his discovery of the evil of racism during and after the trial. Whereas Scout is able to maintain her basic faith in human nature despite Tom's conviction, Jem's faith in justice and in humanity is badly damaged, and he retreats into a state of disillusionment.<br>   <br>   <br>  The moral voice of To Kill a Mockingbird is embodied by Atticus Finch, who is virtually unique in the novel in that he has experienced and understood evil without losing his faith in the human capacity for goodness. Atticus understands that, rather than being simply creatures of good or creatures of evil, most people have both good and bad qualities. The important thing is to appreciate the good qualities and understand the bad qualities by treating others with sympathy and trying to see life from their perspective. He tries to teach this ultimate moral lesson to Jem and Scout to show them that it is possible to live with conscience without losing hope or becoming cynical. In this way, Atticus is able to admire Mrs. Dubose's courage even while deploring her racism. Scout's progress as a character in the novel is defined by her gradual development toward understanding Atticus's lessons, culminating when, in the final chapters, Scout at last sees Boo Radley as a human being. Her newfound ability to view the world from his perspective ensures that she will not become jaded as she loses her innocence.<br>   <br>  The Importance of Moral Education<br>   <br>  Because exploration of the novel's larger moral questions takes place within the perspective of children, the education of children is necessarily involved in the development of all of the novel's themes. In a sense, the plot of the story charts Scout's moral education, and the theme of how children are educated—how they are taught to move from innocence to adulthood—recurs throughout the novel (at the end of the book, Scout even says that she has learned practically everything except algebra). This theme is explored most powerfully through the relationship between Atticus and his children, as he devotes himself to instilling a social conscience in Jem and Scout. The scenes at school provide a direct counterpoint to Atticus's effective education of his children: Scout is frequently confronted with teachers who are either frustratingly unsympathetic to children's needs or morally hypocritical. As is true of To Kill a Mockingbird's other moral themes, the novel's conclusion about education is that the most important lessons are those of sympathy and understanding, and that a sympathetic, understanding approach is the best way to teach these lessons. In this way, Atticus's ability to put himself in his children's shoes makes him an excellent teacher, while Miss Caroline's rigid commitment to the educational techniques that she learned in college makes her ineffective and even dangerous.<br>   <br>  The Existence of Social Inequality <br>   <br>  Differences in social status are explored largely through the overcomplicated social hierarchy of Maycomb, the ins and outs of which constantly baffle the children. The relatively well-off Finches stand near the top of Maycomb's social hierarchy, with most of the townspeople beneath them. Ignorant country farmers like the Cunninghams lie below the townspeople, and the white trash Ewells rest below the Cunninghams. But the black community in Maycomb, despite its abundance of admirable qualities, squats below even the Ewells, enabling Bob Ewell to make up for his own lack of importance by persecuting Tom Robinson. These rigid social divisions that make up so much of the adult world are revealed in the book to be both irrational and destructive. For example, Scout cannot understand why Aunt Alexandra refuses to let her consort with young Walter Cunningham. Lee uses the children's perplexity at the unpleasant layering of Maycomb society to critique the role of class status and, ultimately, prejudice in human interaction.<br>   <br>  Motifs<br>   <br>  Motifs are recurring structures, contrasts, or literary devices that can help to develop and inform the text's major themes.<br>  Gothic Details<br>   <br>  The forces of good and evil in To Kill a Mockingbird seem lar|`|RQuSdG8jaa	One of the themes is protecting the innocent. A mockingbird represents innocence, and in the book, Miss Maudie tells Scout that mockingbirds don't do anything but sing for people, so that's why it's a sin to kill one. That idea is also present in the way they look at Boo Radley in the end. Scout says that hurting Boo would be like shooting a mockingbird. So, providing safety for the innocent or weak (mockingbird/Boo) would be how the title relates to the story.|`|Eke5JMhdaa	Check out this Spark Notes page, it gives three themes in detail and they all relate to how the story can be applied to U.S. History:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/themes.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/mocking/th...</a>|`|Lbg4WJFDaa	Racism in the south.

For Jewish males, adulthood arrives as early as age 12, via the Bar Mitzvah. In Africa, tribes arrange marriages between people as young as 12 or 13. In 1920's America, many teenagers were allowed (and often encouraged) to drive as early as 13 or 14. In today's mobile society a teen's car keys symbolize a rite of independence-the ability to move about without the control or largesse of one's parents.|`|oi41hGUEaa	Driving age limit was not put into effect until 1932, after the great toddler 10 car pileup in New Jersey.|`|fe3cf86ee176021daf6b79ae5ae6df7daa	i dont think there was one back then. most states didnt pass auto laws until the late 1920's|`|VhHVjMe8aa	I'm pretty sure that there wasn't one.

6MMqbzs2aa	Okay, first, it's better to make reservations in advance, because you know there will be enough seats for you and whoever you're taking. Ordering tickets there means you might not get the best seats, and you might not be sitting with your friends/family. You choose your seats according to whats on offer/whats already taken. <br>  <br>  If you sit up that back, you won't have trouble seeing or hearing because the auditoriums aren't usually that huge, although a seat in the middle is the most desirable.<br>  <br>  They can last anywhere between 2 hours and 4. I recently went to a performance at the roundhouse theater, and it started at 6:30 and ended at 9:30, so it was three hours long with a ten minute intermission between the two acts. It really depends what you're going to see.<br>  <br>  I hope you have fun :)|`|vQ0F5g5Kaa	You are given an assigned seat based on your ticket price...how much or how little you pay    You will not have problems seeing or hearing the performance as they will have mic's but if you have hearing problems let them know ahead of time and they will have a solution You will be able to see the stage just like it's a movie screen don't worry!   Most plays are hmmm 2 to 3 hours with an intermission....I don't know what your seeing (play, musical) so I don't know for sure...but time flies by!!! Have Fun!!1|`|1oSL6ozsaa	First I don't really understand.  If you're going to see...lets say wicked, you will have no trouble hearing.  (unless something is wrong with their mics).  I would rather sit in the front because it is harder to see.  And if you sit way in the back, you can still see and hear them, cuz you can go on your knees (in the back row) =]. 2-3 hours with an intermission.
dx3jXzuxaa	Dramatic performances can take place in different types of "houses." In a typical proscenium theatre, there may be a main loge (not lodge) near the stage. This may be differentiated from the Orchestra, or more general seating farther back. The balcony typically overhangs the Orchestra. The floor will typical have a slope or "rake" so that the farther back you go, the higher you will be to allow you to see over the rows in front. The stage will typically be raised above the level of the front most rows of seats, also to help with visibility. <br>  <br>  It is generally preferable to get seats fairly close to the stage, and as close to the center of the house as you can get. But if the proscenium (the arch at the front of the stage) is really wide, you may want to move back a bit so you can see the action all across the stage. <br>  <br>  Arena and thrust theatres will have different arrangements.<br>  <br>  Typically, the theatre will have a seating chart that will show where the stage and seats are. This will give you a better idea of what might be a good seat.|`|fv2O6m9Baa	It all depends on what theatre you are going to. Usually the seats are not right behind one another, so being able to see isnt a problem. I always enjoy sitting as close to the stage as possible so i can hear and the actors more clearly. If you google the theatre you are going to a floor plan might be available one their website.

They are full of action, suspense and some small amounts of romance. <br>  <br>  Twilight Eyes<br>  Lightening<br>  The Bad Place<br>  Odd Thomas series<br>  Oddkins (child/young adult illustrated book)<br>  The Darkest Evening of the Year<br>  Door to December<br>  Watchers<br>  Intensity<br>  The Mask<br>  Phantoms<br>  Cold Fire<br>  Hideaway<br>  Dragon Tears<br>  and...<br>  Strange Highways.<br>  <br>  Kim Harrison's Hollows series is wonderful! It is full of action, sarcasm, mystery, magic and love. There are 7 books total now, the first one is Dead Witch Walking.<br>  <br>  I also love Piers Anthony's Xanth series. They are fantasy. The first one is A Spell for Chameleon. <br>  <br>  Charlaine Harris writes a great series about Sookie Stackhouse, called the Southern Vampire series. The first book is Dead After Dark. True Blood on HBO is based on the books, and both the books and the show are very good.

It's kinda hard at first, but it's a great book.<br>  <br>  If you're looking for a "young adult" book you should read Sherlock Holmes books, or a book called "Gone," or my favorite, "Me and Mr. Darcy" by Alexandra Potter.<br>  <br>  It really depends on the type of genre you like. You should try going to Borders Bookstore and go to the Young Adults section. You'll be sure to find something there. Or try your local library's Young Adults section, but most libraries have semi older books which aren't always entertaining enough---at least for me.|`|XITPweLEaa	I'm going to recommend to you the same grown-up book given to me by my dad when I was about your age. "Lightening" by Dean Koontz. Many of his older books are better than the new stuff.

The Left Behind Series by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins. There are like 12 books total and counting.....but it's one of the best series I've read and kept me on the edge of my seat from start of book 1 to end of book 12! (There are also movies based off the books - I, II and III and movie IV is about to go into production, I think).<br>  <br>  2. The First North American Series by Michael Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear. There are like, 12 books total and counting. These are fiction novels based on the first Native American tribes that were here in U.S., Canada, Mexico and South America BEFORE the arrival of the Europeans and are based on actual archaeological evidence! (Turns out the authors are a husband and wife team who are real-world archaeologists who just happen to have very good novel writing skills as well!!) <br>  <br>  3. The Anasazi Mystery series by Micheal Gear and Kathleen O'Neal Gear. The names of the books: The Vistor, Bonewalker, & Summoning God. About Southwestern Indian-style witchcraft in a "whodoneit" atmosphere. <br>  <br>  4. Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants by Ann Brashares. There are 4 books in the series and 2 movies. I read the books and watched the movies. All good in my opinion. About 4 bestfriends who share 4 summers together as they go from 15-18 and it tells everything that happens to them along the way. Good read. <br>  <br>  5. Anything by James D. Doss (who writes fiction novels based on actual Colorado Ute Indian beliefs) or Tony Hillerman (who writes fiction novels based on actual Navajo Indian beliefs). There are SEVERAL books in both of their series.   <br>  <br>  6. He's Just Not That Into You by Greg B. and Liz Tucculi? Seriously, this was a good read as it helped me to see what all I was doing wrong with guys I liked and what to do right in the future when I like a guy! :)<br>  <br>  7. The Norton Anthology of English Literature. Everything from Chaucer to Shakespeare to Milton. My favorite tale in there is "Sir Gaiwan and the Green Knight". <br>  <br>  8. The Holy Bible. Now, before you roll your eyes and call me crazy, I'm dead serious, dude. It gots action, it gots romance, it gots wars and drama, it gots suspense, it gots comedy in certain areas, it gots history, it gots prophecy, just about everything that a "good book" would have. What more can you ask for? :)<br>  <br>  9. "Pride & Prejudice" by Jane Austen. An awesome romance story that took place in the 1800's .<br>  <br>  10. I wouldn't recommend the Harry Potter books as the "plot" sort've gets old after awhile. lol.<br>  <br>  11. "Dracula" by Bram Stroker (the 1991 Penquin Viking edition, edited by Maurice Hindel).<br>  <br>  I pretty much told you just about everything I have on my bookshelf at home! :) lol
OHgqxc7Saa	How old are you? You sound young, & the "little girl" aspect might flush itself out in time.  You have a good voice in there, but it's obvious that you are untrained & if you're in middleschool/highschool I would highly suggest vocal lessons, because it seems you have a lot of potential.  <br>  <br>  If you're not into that, though, I would suggest more breath support.  Lack of breath is what gets you off key. The little girl sound comes from singing in your throat & in the "fry" of your voice. If you plug your nose and sing & it sounds funny, then you're not singing correctly. Dropping your jaw & creating space in the back of your throat (ie raising the soft palate) will help bring the sound out of your nose & into your head, which will make it sound fuller.<br>  <br>  Basically, it seems you have a really great voice in there that has a lot of power, & with some training & breath support could be very impressive!<br>  <br>  Definitely keep singing!|`|K4Z0d7IXaa	You're pretty good.|`|pakRsmzWaa	You are a good singer! You hit a lot of really high notes, I am very jealous of that. If you want to improve, I would say to work on singing more from your diaphragm and less from your nose. It will fix the overall "little girl" tone you feel you have, because it will increase the power. Voice lessons would be awesome, but you are fine without them. Just focus on pushing out with your ribs and singing through that instead of drawing power from your nose. You will have more sound that way.<br>  <br>  Your voice is really nice and pretty.

Instead of shooting down her ideas, maybe try and help her make her plot and such into things that you think would be more liked. Give her /good/ criticism, to help her not because you think her story is crap.<br>  <br>  You are, of course, entitled to your own opinion. You don't have to be a huge fan of your friend's writing-it may not be your taste- but I think you should still support her, and try to look at it as "Would it,generally, be well liked?" instead of "Do I think it's good?". I read it, and personally, I'm not a fan but that doesn't mean there isn't some people who wont. Honestly,though, I don't think the poodle business would be really liked.<br>  <br>  I have to agree with you on the day job; It is great your friend is so interested in writing, but it is difficult to get a book published and popular enough to live on that money alone. Plus what about money for food and bills while she is writing the book? Personally, I think she should continue writing but it would be pretty stupid to quit her job to do so.<br>  -<br>  Are you two actually friends? It defiantly seems more like you two are just trying to hurt each other. I, obviously, don't know the whole story but if I may make a suggestion you might want to try and stop being friends with her. It seems more like you are just angry. Then again; I don't know.

I think you're being ridiculous.<br>  <br>  Second, it doesn't matter how many times she's trashed you. If you want to be the better person, you shouldn't be putting her work up here without her permission. Do you think you're a good friend? I hope not.

t8mLfDFtaa	Don't pinch your lips, add breath support, and practice long tones, more specifically starting on the C below the staff (basically open below the first line) hold it for 6-8 slow beats and go down the scale, so lower not higher. try hitting pedal tones (very very low Notes) they can be pretty hard to play but with practice you'll get it, playing those very low notes helps increase the muscle in your face helping you hit higher notes. i forgot what the highest note i can hit is but last time i checked i can hit the E above the staff and the lowest note i can play is the pedal tone C. basically the highest note and lowest look like this<br>   oo and the highest note is suppose to have a line thew it but i can't type a line the a 0.

" He was referring to an incident in Grenoble, 1740, ten years before Marie Antoinette was born. It has been speculated that he was actually writing of Maria Theresa of Spain or one of various other aristocrats though no evidence has ever been offered for this. In the meantime, Marie Antoinette's attribution to the quote was current in her time in antiroyalist propaganda, most likely to hasten her way to the guillotine.<br>  Source(s):<br>  Wikipedia: The Free Encyclopedia|`|KHSOVxViaa	Hehe!<br>  <br>  Nope.<br>  <br>  According to the story, when she asked why there was a mob of angry, hungry protesters demanding bread, she was informed that there wasn't enough bread.  Her response was "Qu'ils mangent de la brioche", which roughly means "let them eat cake".  Brioche is a type of sweet pastry.<br>  <br>  However, the story is likely apocryphal - there's no evidence that she actually said it.|`|pIsXofvyaa	Building on guanotwozero's answer, at the time in France there were a lot of nasty rumors about the aristocracy and royal family floating around. This particular rumor can be found in various libeles (scandelous, tabloid type pamphlets). It builds off a wider body of rumors that the aristocracy were behind some giant grain shortage conspiracy, and they really didn't care if the people starved. Although, to be fair to the mob, Louis XVI was about a good a statesman as he was at keeping his head on his shoulders after the Revolution.
W1h3w5gdaa	Oh, if only there had been Yahoo! Answers (or the Internet, for that matter) when I was 12 years old. I wish to GOD someone would've told me the following:<br>  <br>  The best advice anyone can give is to go out and find yourself a good instructor (and that doesn't always mean expensive private lessons; keep reading.) I've been teaching for several years and have had hundreds of students. Most of them came to lessons after failing to learn by trying to use books and video systems sold over the Internet.<br>  <br>  It's not that books and systems are inherently bad, it's that most of them are designed to sell you the next lesson in the series. (e.g., they'll teach you the minor pentatonic scale, but you have to buy book 2 to learn the "major" pentatonic scale. They fail to mention that it's the same scale, just moved three frets.)<br>  <br>  Also, these systems are "static" meaning you only learn what is presented to you in the order it was presented. It's missing the most important fundamental of any teaching method; the ability to ask questions!<br>  <br>  Don't buy the hype that being "self-taught" makes you a more legitimate guitarist or musician somehow. That's a crock. No-one is "self-taught" unless they found a guitar in a cave, figured out what notes to tune it to, created all new scales and chords from scratch... everyone learns from someone. If you learn from a book, then you're taught by a book. Or if you learn from a buddy or a group of people, then they are your teachers. You just didn't pay them. And you get what you pay for.<br>  <br>  Decide what your goal is with guitar, then go find a teacher who will take you there. I prefer instructors that are trained and certified by a network using a specific method, but with enough flexibility to take you in whatever direction you need to go. But I'm biased, because I happen to BE such an instructor, and I wouldn't teach the way I do if I didn't think it was the best way.<br>  <br>  I'll put a link in the source field and you can check out my network's website which has a list of instructors. Some of us give private lessons via e-mail.<br>  <br>  Now, as for beginning tips, I'll tell you this:<br>  <br>  1) Learn a basic finger exercise and practice it for five minutes, really really slowly, every day.<br>  <br>  2) Learn a basic melody, like Mary Had a Little Lamb and play it until it flows naturally.<br>  <br>  3) Learn the following chords: C - A - G - E - D - Am - Dm - Em and memorize how to play them. Practice changing between chords very slowly without losing your rhythm. All guitar chords are based off these eight positions.<br>  <br>  4) Mute your strings and strum along with a lot of different songs. (Muting is just touching all the strings lightly with your left (fret) hand so that when you strum, instead of notes you get a percussive beat sound.)<br>  <br>  5) Learn the C-major scale in open position. (Click the Ultimate Guitar link below and play JUST the first measure. Ignore everything else.) Use your 3rd finger for notes in fret 3, 2nd finger for fret 2, and 1st finger for fret 1. Memorize it and play it all the time. Then figure out how to play it elsewhere on the fretboard.<br>  <br>  6) Learn to play 8-bar and 12-bar blues with a straight beat and a shuffle beat. All rock music (and by extension, most pop music) has its roots in the blues. Understanding this will help you understand a great deal more.<br>  <br>  That should get you started, but you should really get a professional teacher. Check with your local YMCA and if they don't have a guitar program, have them contact the YMCA of Central Kentucky. (Link below.) They have the most successful YMCA Guitar Program in the United States, including sponsorship from Gibson, and should be able to help them get started.|`|dzBr9kPFaa	Any age is a great age if you want to learn.  I learned to play the guitar on my own, but I probably would've learned faster with lessons.  It's helpful to have someone watch what you are doing and point out the tricks that make it easier.  <br>  <br>  Make sure that you have a guitar that is properly setup and easy to play by having a guitar shop check it out and adjust if needed.  You can learn on electric or acoustic - whatever interests you.  Good luck.|`|0AUPrCMZaa	Dude, check it out.  I have always wanted to learn an instrument.  Pretty much my whole life....I am 27 now.  I wasted about 10 years of that time trying to teach myself, and always doubted myself because I always thought i was too old to start.  I am taking Piano lessons right now...  If you are serious about learning an instrument, you are young!  do it right!  don't listen to all these people talking about tabs (that is the easy way out) and it still isnt that easy.<br>  <br>  If you want to really learn something....get an instructor and stick with it!  When you are older you will look back and not regret it....if you however, try and teach yourself, pick up bad habits, and not learn everything, when you are 27..... you will be writing this response on a future yahoo answers to someone your age now.  :D<br>  <br>  good luck man. :)|`|bZkxW1Abaa	im 15 and i just started. start looking at tabs and try them. try to pick easy songs and get harder as you get better. this is what i did and im getting better. my sister knows someone who is a great guitarist so im getting lessons soon. so try to learn yourself, but if you arent getting any better after a few months, try getting lessons.|`|AA10199093	12 is a great age to learn guitar and you'll learn much faster if you take lessons with an instructor in person.|`|gM3tw8Ifaa	perfect age.

Its like saying try to teach your self every math problem without going to school.<br>  learn it for 4 - 5 years and if your good quit and practice on ur own|`|e7KoyoWsaa	Jere, your the right age to learn. Make sure you get the right guitar for you.<br>  The vast majority of your learning is going to be done on your own.  It helps for someone to get you started, and if you don't have anyone who can show you some stuff then take a few lessons.  Playing with other people is very helpful, but lessons can be expensive so try and make some musician friends.  It's easy actually, if you carry around a guitar people seem to want to talk to you.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't pay anything for online guitar lessons, but there is plenty of stuff on youtube.  I'm currently teaching myself banjo by watching free instructional videos.|`|Z1YZs8Izaa	Well, my boyfriend got a guitar for Christmas when he was 13, he kinda played around with it by himself for a while, then kinda tried teaching himself with the help of the internet, then he took lessons with a guy his mom knew, and now he's amazing (:<br>  <br>  Now he doesn't get lessons, he just gets the tabs from online and teaches himself.|`|lLtbH6pZaa	Teach yourself learn by ear it is difficult but you will be so much more better the only thing that really is had is keeping yourself motivated to keep learning new stuff. Look up tabs on the internet too. If you want to take lessons you should wait until you get stuck trying to teach yourself. Like for me I have taught my self all the basics but I have trouble learning speed and I think I might take some lessons for that.|`|AA10128139	try to get some lessons to get your foot in the door, guitar is hard to teach yourself without any music background... also with a teacher your less likley to get frustrated and quit.<br>  <br>  dont take online lessons...<br>  <br>  but if u must.. guitartricks comes to mind, youtube is allways good... and nextlevelguitar|`|AA12080215	Take it. you will never regret it.

I never touched the guitar until I was 28 years old, and successfully taught myself to play both acoustic (mostly classical, my first love) and electric. You just have to have the love and the passion for the instrument, and you will learn to play. GO FOR IT!<br>  <br>  Stay away from tab until you learn to read notation. Learning tab will limit you to being just a guitarist. Learning notation makes you a MUSICIAN.|`|oweQc1OBaa	12 is a great age to learn, some learn at like 5, some learn at 8, i learned at 11, but i think 12 is a great age to learn.<br>  <br>  the best way to take lessons is probably from a teacher, so i would recommend getting a teacher. they will show you proper positions and you will learn more theory that way. lessons should be about 15 dollars per half hour, if its more than 20 dollars per half hour, don't do it. make sure that the teacher is experienced. go to your local music store, see if they have any, also www.yellowpages.com and type in guitar lessons.<br>  <br>  <br>  teaching yourself could be hard at first, and you won't get much theory unless you buy a book. a dvd might also help.<br>  you want to learn how to read tabs. <a href="http://www.howtotuneaguitar.org/lessons/the-basics/how-to-read-guitar-tab/" rel="nofollow">http://www.howtotuneaguitar.org/lessons/...</a><br>  then you might want to learn a couple scales and songs. www.ultimate-guitar.com has millions of tabs and songs. i would recommend going there because they also have reviews on guitars and lessons. <a href="http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/misc_scales_tabs.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/tabs/misc...</a> here are different tabs for different scales.<br>  you also need to learn chords. chords are important in the guitar world. <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcmb4RplClQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lcmb4RplC...</a> <br>  if you somehow can't read tabs well, try going to www.expertvillage.com and www.youtube.com they will have videos on how to play different songs on the guitar. <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dSp79TDWoc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5dSp79TDW...</a> that video helped me a lot. that is the first in his video series on how to play guitar, the next will always be in the video response.<br>  <br>  i highly recommend getting a teacher to take lessons, because they will show you everything you need, and sometimes take song requests, but if your trying to save money because of the economy, try using the sites i listed above.<br>  <br>  good luck and hoped this helps!|`|VYRMz5qxaa	Its totally worth taking lessons at a school, then after a year or two you can teach yourself because you will know the basics.<br>  <br>  I  wouldnt suggest online because no one is tehre to correct you.<br>  And any age is a good age to start learning guitar =)|`|ro5vFj9Aaa	take lessons and learn i have son that can play classical guitar and its pretty. its worht it and then fromthen on you can larn and play most stuff.|`|vLD8L1P0aa	find a good teacher to teach you

Ec2uIBjxaa	Back-flips are a basic intermediate gymnastics maneuver that many people have trouble doing. The back-flip, also known as the back-tuck due to the importance of the leg tuck, is a 360° backwards rotation from a stand. There are three parts to the back-flip: the set, the tuck and the landing. Just knowing how to do a correct back- on a # Do not stop in the middle of the move, the fall can cause broken bones and/or a trip to the hospital.<br>  <br>  1)-Start with one foot in front then step together and swing your arm and then act like you are going to sit in a chair and then jump straight up(never jump backwards you will lose height) and tuck your legs into your chest and flip backwards then land it NEVER look down. Keep your eyes focused on a spot about eye level and try to keep your head in that position throughout the flip.<br>  <br>  2)-Prepare for your jump by "digging down".<br>      * When digging down do not let your legs bend more than 90°, or below your knee.<br>  <br>  3)-Never jump backwards, or you will fall.<br>  <br>  4)-Remember to not look down.<br>  <br>  5)-Some people tuck their arms under their knees.(OPTIONAL)<br>  <br>  6)-- Some people put their arms above their legs.<br>  <br>  7)- Begin to extend your lower back towards the landing.<br>  <br>  6)-Bend your knees again as you land<br>  <br>  7)-Always have a spotter<br>  <br>  8)-Firstly try this on a trampoline<br>  <br>  9)-GOOD<br>  <br>  10)LUCK<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  xxoo give me 10 points|`|VmQsGfrEaa	DO THIS ON A TRAMPOLINE FIRST. <br>  To do a front flip, jump forward as if doing a dive in a swimming pool, with your legs stretched out. You will have the urge to tuck and curl your legs before your are in mid-air, but dont. You'll just fall. When you are JUST slightly past mid-air, so your weight is guarenteed to flip itself, tuck and curl yourself.  As for backward, I haven't gotten up to that.<br>  <br>  ***PLEASE NOTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! SERIOUS INJURY SUCH AS BEING PARALYZED OR EVEN DEATH CAN OCCUR IF YOU DO NOT JUMP HIGH ENOUGH AND FALL ON YOUR NECK.|`|3BluqRiaaa	i  have no idea i would like to learn how to do one too but any way ask a friend who takes gymnastics and can do a back flip and they can teach you|`|7oiBFIguaa	Practice the rotation speed of the back flip into a pool or water first, dont want to screw up and land on your neck and die.

Real hard to answer, but to  "talented" writers, I would dare a guess. Writing is peanuts to them. Why? Because, basically, to write  needs loads of INSPIRATION. Somehow, the thoughts keep on coming unceasingly. Then, when inspiration seems to ebb, no matter how hard they try, words seem so bland, trite, so hard to come about. Next maybe the learned techniques, which you formally learn through workshops and seminars and the school of experience.
AA12228381	Actorsaccess.com is free, but I highly suggest you get the showfax subscription ($68 / year) so you can submit yourself electronically.  However, actorsaccess.com only covers certain geographic areas.  Obviously I have no idea where you are, but most auditions are going to be in the bigger towns like LA,  and NY.  You can try craigslist, as there are legit projects listed there, but there is also a lot of BS, so please be very careful with anything off of craigslist.<br>  <br>  Sites like exploretalent.com or talenthunter.com (and their like) are scams. The projects are either outdated, or are for things you can find on your own.<br>  <br>  Having a general idea of where you are geographically (like next to what major city) will help us answer the question as castingnetworks.com is also another great site (used by LA Casting directors - commercially mainly)<br>  <br>  Also, keep in mind that acting is a craft, but it's also a businss. And in any business there are expenses to make the business work.  If you are serious about acting, something like the $68 for the showfax subscription is a very minor expense compared to getting headshots, promo material, training classes, etc.

Patricia, heart-broken, goes out to find her, but doesn't bring any money. She, has no choice, turns to prostitution to, and makes a lot of money.

On the other hand, we could always move to another planet further away from the Sun, our year would be longer, but the larger planets have longer days anyway.

But keep it, it's still fantastic.|`|92c0c9e5d7ee893f8f8042c1689ff773aa	First off, that was very nicely written.  The exact verbs were used correctly and the person's feeling of calmness really showed through.  There was one thing I noticed, though.  I'm guessing you're a fan of the Twilight series, because I could see a huge similarity between your way of writing and stephenie meyer's way.  The whole grasp of how they were going to sacrifice their life for that one person also seemed similar to Twilight.  That doesn't mean you should stop, though.  It was still very nicely done.  As a suggestion, you should watch as you write to make sure that you don't make it too similar to Twilight.  But it was very good and you're an amazing writer.|`|9sDh4lPJaa	Um it sounds a little like twilight BUT other than that i love it!|`|bFfWFsFWaa	Hmmm<br>  I like it. I'll be sending it to a publisher and a literary agent (with my name attached to it of course :) )<br>  <br>  Thanks for the cool story! I'm sure I'll make a decent amount of money off of it.|`|pgHlTuRnaa	I don't think she should be content, maybe at ease, but not happy. Happy seems, crazy. Who's happy to die? At ease, but not content, other then that I liked it. Also another thing I didn't like is how she is in love with someone and finds that they are soooo much more important then she is. Your lives are equil! People have to get that through their thick skulls! It seems cheesy! sorry! My opinion, the one thing that really bugs me about the twilight ssaga, and you've also done that. Sorry I really am but I don't like that. <br>  Other then those two, I found it pertty good!
6gIolMulaa	I believe that you have to become a police officer first and then you go back to the police academy to become a detective but I'm not completely sure. A detective involves many things but it mostly depends on what you specify in as a detective. An example would be a homicide detective, which is a detective that solves homicides (murders).

shVgCizBaa	Before Federation in 1901, Australia was merely a collection of states. We were not united as 'Australia' at all. As a result, each state had its own parliament, armed forces, its own economy, its own tarrif laws and its own unique identity - this often produced rivalries and arguments. It also led to divisions that prevented the states from acting together in times of crisis.<br>  <br>  Federation in 1901 was signficant that it brought all the states together with a Commonwealth government in Canberra. For the first time, Australia would be united and the states would be represented in the Senate in Canberra.<br>  <br>  Before 1901 and well after 1901, we did not think of ourselves as Australians, but as British citizens. Because we were not united, it was seen as treasonous to talk of being 'Australian' as most people identified themselves as being British citizens first.<br>  <br>  Federation changed that slightly. With our own capital in Canberra and our own national parliament, Australia began to formulate its own national laws - to break down the barriers between states and to unify the country. Before 1901, Australia looked to Britain for its laws - but now we could vote and decide on our own laws.<br>  <br>  Federation also introduced what it meant to be an 'Australian' - while some still thought of themselves as British citizens, in 1901 all Australians had to vote on whether to unite - it was the first time that we collectively got together to decide the fate of our nation. This was unique as previously it was the British that decided - that all changed in 1901. <br>  <br>  With the First World War, Australia sent troops to fight against Imperial Germany and Turkey. At Gallipoli, Australian and New Zealand troops - ANZACs fought together. It was the first time that Australians would have an identity not as British Empire soldiers, but as Australians or ANZACs. <br>  <br>  Slowly, Federation has changed civic life in Australia by moulding us into Australian citizens - a united country. This has been done not just by separating Australia from Britain, but by Australians taking on more responsilities for our own government and institutions.<br>  <br>  After 1901, Australia began to mint its own coins and in the 1960's Australia moved away from the Imperial system of pence and quarters and adopted the modern dollars that we have today.<br>  <br>  But also the biggest changes since Federation is that we have moved away from a white Australia policy to have an immigration policy much more diverse - ie people from Sudan, Asia, Europe. Before Britain dominated Australia's perspective on the world - but with Federation and the Second World War, Australia has adopted a much more independent way of thinking about the world.<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20080223190600AAteChq">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>

shVgCizBaa	Anyone have any information on any American family rivalries like this? the Hatfields and the McCoys  --------------------One of the most notorious family feuds in history may finally be put to rest this summer. <a href="http://genealogy.about.com/library/weekly/aa043000a.htm" rel="nofollow">http://genealogy.about.com/library/weekl...</a> The rivalries between the Hatfields and the McCoys began about 1863 and  ran off and on for nearly 30 years.  Descendants of these famous families hope that any lingering effects will disappear at the first ever Hatfield and McCoy national reunion to be held June 9-11, 2000 in Pikeville, Kentucky. <br>  <br>  History of the Feud<br>  The Hatfields and McCoys were prominent families who lived along the Kentucky-West Virginia border, on opposite sides of a stream known as Tug Fork, off the Big Sandy River.  Both clans were part of the first wave of pioneers to settle the Tug Valley.  The McCoys, led by patriarch, Randolph "Randel" McCoy, lived on the Kentucky side of the river, while the Hatfields, led by William Anderson "Devil Anse" Hatfield, occupied the West Virginia side. Though it wouldn't have been readily apparent from their crude log cabin homes deep in heavily forested mountain territory, both men were prosperous farmers. <br>  <br>  The true origins of the feud between these two men and their families are lost in the mists of history, but legend has it that the bitter feelings began in 1878 when Randolph McCoy accused Floyd Hatfield of stealing one of his hogs.  Such an offense was taken very seriously in those times as hogs were an extremely valuable part of the farming economy of the valley.  Tempers flared and soon the two faced off in court.   <br>  <br>  Trouble already existed between these two families prior to the incident with the hog, however.  Some people attribute the beginning of the feud to animosities which developed during the American Civil War.  Others say that competition between the families in the timber market sparked the hostilities. Whatever the origin, the peak of the hostilities came when three of Randel McCoy's sons, Bud, Tolbert, and Pharmer McCoy, fatally wounded Ellison Hatfield after he insulted Tolbert on election day in 1882.  Devil Anse Hatfield retaliated for the killing of his brother by executing the three without a trial.<br>  <br>  Violence ebbed and flowed for the next several years.  In 1887 the feud was revived by a lawyer named Perry Cline, a distant cousin of Randolph McCoy, who used his influence to have the five year old murder indictments against the Hatfields reissued and to start the extradition process to bring them to Kentucky for trial.   When people got frustrated with the slowness of the legal system, a raid into Hatfield territory was organized and several Hatfield supporters were captured and brought back to Kentucky.  The news of this successful raid inflamed the Hatfields and resulted in an attempt by them to eliminate Randel McCoy on January 1, 1888.  This tragically resulted in the death of two more of his children and the burning of his home.  <br>  <br>  The violence was now not only between the Hatfields and the McCoys, but between the states of Kentucky and West Virginia.  Both governors called in the National Guard as more raids were staged by the McCoys into Hatfield territory.  The governor of West Virginia, E. Willis Wilson, accused Kentucky of violating the extradition process by kidnapping the Hatfields and appealed the matter all the way to the Supreme Court of the United States.  In May of 1889, the Supreme Court ruled against West Virginia and the Hatfields stood trial in Kentucky.  All eight were found guilty of murder.  One of them was publicly hanged for the murder of Alifair McCoy, the daughter of Randel McCoy killed in the January 1888 raid on his home, and the other seven were sentenced to life in prison.<br>  <br>  The feud, which lasted for over a decade and claimed the lives of twelve men, was finally over.  Enter the year 1993 and a man named Clyde Floyd "Bo" McCoy, Jr, the great, great, great grandson of the famous Randolph McCoy.  Bo McCoy was in his final year of college, 800 miles from home with no money, and was unable to make it to his grandfather's funeral.  "I felt that I had dishonored my grandfather," says Bo McCoy.  "I missed the funeral.  I have never been able to deal with that."  Bo's need to memorialize his grandfather grew into a family Web site, www.real-mccoys.com in May 1998.  The site was originally intended as a "cybertavern" for family members to chat and share stories, but as Bo developed the site, he realized that he could do more.  "Someone suggested that we have a reunion, and the idea was born."<br>  As the McCoy's plans evolved, Pike County Tourism, Pikeville College, and the City of Pikeville joined the McCoys in the development of the reunion.  Word about the McCoy reunion in Pikeville, Ky quickly spread to the national level.  Bo McCoy extended an invitation to the Hatfields on the McCoy reunion Web site,  and when the Hatfields learned about it, they wanted to join.

It involved two warring families of the West Virginia-Kentucky backcountry along the Tug Fork River, off the Big Sandy River. The Hatfields involved in the feud descended from Ephraim (born c. 1765), and the McCoys from William (born c. 1750).

245296e926068369590c2d4c49cdf531aa	It's about this little family of three living in a small apartment. The three of them, the mother and her two grown-up children (whose names I can't remember), all have their own problems to deal with throughout the play. I didn't think it was too bad, but a lot of people I know who read it hated it. I think it depends on whether you're reading it by yourself or not. I read it with a group and was able to dissect what was happening with them, and for me, analyzing books and plays and such makes them more interesting.<br>  <br>  So really, it depends. Just get ready for the word "jonquils." Every time I hear it or see it, I think of The Glass Menagerie.|`|CRuxWsi0aa	By Tennessee Williams, right? I'm bout to read it. I'll get back to you when I do :)
VCIZJQCJaa	yes it's good lots of twists and turns about life.here is an overview of the play if you want to look at it then decide to read the book <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/menagerie/summary.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/menagerie/...</a>|`|xoXkHOVsaa	It's about an emotionally abused woman who is obsessed with glass figurines.  It's ok.  It's pretty short, so it's worth reading.|`|BBfIXcI0aa	It's a play exploring identity, and the tension between one's desire to be true to onesself and true to one's family.<br>  <br>  Tom, Laura's brother and Amanda's son, was forced into the role of man of the house when their father left many years ago. Even with his mother's attempts to work, the best they can afford is a small flat in a dodgy end of town - a far cry from the rich Southern upbringing Amanda had been a part of. To cope, Amanda still lives in the past in her head, in a time when everyone knew their place and women had gentleman callers come court them before carrying them away. She has such a hope for Laura, her slightly handicapped daughter, whose shy personality and affinity for her collection of glass figurines hardly mesh with her mother's dreams. Laura, Tom, and Amanda each have their own desires and hopes for their life, their own demons to face, and their own decisions to make about life.<br>  <br>  It wasn't one of my favourite plays, but it's very well-written, and it's one of those plays you really SHOULD read if you're a theatre practitioner.|`|65b4d262faafda0398978c29510dcbefaa	it's about a awkward girl (i don't remember totally, but she was really quiet and i think she was a little weird in the head) she collected glass figures and her mom was disappointed in her cause she couldn't get a gentleman caller/boyfriend/husband. and i think she had a brother that took care of her?...i'm not entirely sure about the brother part.<br>  but i think the brother worked at a factory<br>  <br>  i didn't really like it. it's a quick read though|`|ytGihkzraa	Well, it is about it about a Lady named Patricia, who meets Gertrude and their secret love for each other in a glass house. Patricia wants to be a cook, and Gertrude's life-long dream is to go to San Francisco to be a prostitute. When they have a big fight, Gertrude leaves her. Patricia, heart-broken, goes out to find her, but doesn't bring any money. She, has no choice, turns to prostitution to, and makes a lot of money. In fact, She turns out to be a better prostitute than Gertrude. Meeting years later, Gertrude is extremely jealous. The plot twists when they result in having prostitution competitions. It tears them farther apart and both their lives end in STDs (which are now actually called STIs by the way). <br>  <br>  Great book, sad, unexpecting ending.<br>  Hope you like it!

xh0Pagv3aa	actually i think intoxication is a lying representation of said person.|`|FoIxsunVaa	No. A distorted version of your uncontrolled instincts comes out. It does not reflect the true person, but it IS an aspect of the person, one that is usually under check.|`|CLB32006aa	It does tend to come out|`|YmtNel5haa	I think some people want to tell the truth and not be held responsible for the consequences it may bring (angering a friend, losing a friend that type of thing) and so they can claim drinking caused this lack of inhibition.  It frees them from blame.  I don't believe it, it's a cheap cop out.|`|OUbNSXjJaa	Whatever goes in has to come out. If there is an inlet, there should be an outlet.

Gdc72WCJaa	it means theres no such thing as life in a world of reality<br>  choke on that piece of deep ****|`|AA10729675	It means that everything is relative.  Everyone has his/her own perception.

6UZhC0ZRaa	fences was a good book. Its intresting, but only thing i didnt like about it is that it draged on and on each act.
ff1e69f5b0fdca4411c73634e35831e6aa	It means that Irene was torn between two things that are fairly similar about herself.
ZW24GerXaa	Stephenie Meyer has stated that the apple on the cover represents the forbidden fruit from the book of Genesis. It symbolizes Bella and Edward's love, which is forbidden, similar to the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, as is implied by the quote from Genesis 2:17 that is quoted at the beginning of the book. It also represents Bella's knowledge of what good and evil are, and the choice that she has in partaking of the "forbidden fruit", Edward, or choosing not to see him. <br>  The link below shows where i got my information:<br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(novel)#Cover" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twilight_(n...</a><br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|hUYaaXBvaa	i guess its a biblical allusion to the apple and temptation<br>  dont quote me though, but im pretty sure|`|ZpR57jbBaa	you know what i was thinking the same thing|`|7FJae3Lmaa	The apple has always been known as the "forbidden fruit". In the bible Eve ate a apple from the tree they were forbidden to eat from. The cover respresents how Edward is forbidden, but Bella chooses him anyway.|`|anDOwZXNaa	the apple is also known as the forbidden fruit.<br>  like eve & adam. <br>  & bella & edward has a forbidden love considering he's a vampire , and she's a mortal.|`|npxSyiFfaa	Ha. That's funny.<br>  If you seriously want to know then go to Steph's website. click on Twilight and go to the Q&A it is on there.<br>  <br>  And i've always wanted to know what the Forbidden Fruit is anyway....|`|NCy5Oj0jaa	no the apple represents the forbidden fruit (like how bella and edwards relationship shouldn't be)|`|fN8Js8aeaa	It is considered as the "Forbidden Fruit" like in Genesis.  Adam and Eve ate the apple even though they knew it was not allowed.  Likewise, Bella and Edward know their love is forbidden.  This is the main reason, and Meyer explains it a little better on her website:  <a href="http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_faq.html#apple" rel="nofollow">http://www.stepheniemeyer.com/twilight_f...</a>|`|5lm9D2zdaa	okay so as someone said before the apple in the hands represent "Forbidden Fruit" as in Adam and Eve in the bible. This meant alot to Stephenie. However when someone asked her "What kind of flower is that on the cover, and what does it mean?" She had this to say....<br>  <br>  ." That is a ruffled tulip. As for the meaning… If you've read the Twilight faq, you know that the apple cover had a lot of meaning for me, and I was an active part of the covering process. However, that experience is more the exception than the rule in the publishing world. Something to keep in mind if you intend to embark on a career as a writer: lots of things you might expect to be under your control are not. Covers, for example. Those are mostly up to the publisher and the marketing and sales departments. So I don't know what the tulip means—I didn't have anything to do with this one."<br>  <br>  so I think what they want us to do is infer our own meanings from them. they might mean something different to you than they do to anyone else, and that might be why you love them so much. hope this helped. <br>  <br>  i love edward!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071216170833AAm35Zj">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  <br>  <br>  howvere i believe that yes; she wanted to keep him away from the doctor. because the doctor would find out he is a vampire and all havoc would break looose.|`|47c9bb50007abb2cf08033c48a798c39aa	Your question has definitely been answered, but I wanted to say I loved your joke. I saw someone mentioned Smeyer's site, so I'll link you to it! Everything you did and did not want to know about the series is there.|`|mQNyNGPsaa	The apple represents temptation. An apple is known as a forbidden fruit and normal when something is forbidden people want it even more.|`|GJMKflrNaa	an apple represents forbidden fruit|`|vCfPaWdGaa	in the movie  edward throws the apple on his foot and catches it with his hands|`|rt30mwXbaa	what do you mean "does she want to keep the doctor away from edward" ?|`|cdbf5f1b12c614124e41540a7b96b914aa	the forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest.<br>  <br>  seriously.<br>  that's why.

HCzS9cSZaa	I love it!  Very captivating and definitley not a twilight rip off.  You're right- the writing is a bit dramatic, but it has an elegance to it that really is compelling. Plus if this prologue is told from the character's point of view at the end of the story, then the drama shows a kind of wisdom from the character.  I really like it!! You're very talented and should definitley continue:)|`|FcXRv4Vaaa	It sounds incredibly interesting so far; I absolutely love how dark it seems. Don't get rid of that.<br>  =)<br>  <br>  I say you should defiantly go for it, you'll never know if you don't try. If you decide not to try and make a book out of it, you should at least turn it into a short story and post it on Quizilla or something. I defiantly would love to read more, and know more about the plot and characters.<br>  Good Job.<br>  =D|`|bFfWFsFWaa	Hmmm<br>  I like it. I'll be sending it to a publisher and a literary agent (with my name attached to it of course :) )<br>  <br>  Thanks for the cool story! I'm sure I'll make a decent amount of money off of it.|`|QLlu6GMwaa	Perhaps less religion?<br>  Still pretty good|`|DhwqqWVFaa	I have to admit, you lost me after the fist sentence.  The fires of hell make your blood burn with an intensity you never knew was possible?  Sounds like hell to me.  A moth drawn to the flame and enjoying it.  Uninspired, cliche and boring.  <br>  <br>  Since you are young, I force myself to read on.  The perfect Christian child ... again uninspired, cliche and boring.  The perfect Christian child doesn't exist.  Isn't that the point of Christianity to begin with?<br>  <br>  Look, I admire your ambition and your talent.  I just feel that it would be better utilized working on something a little more inspiring.  Why contribute to the common, twisted nature of man, when you could be a part of the extraordinary?|`|e6eKJPpNaa	Dramatic yes, but it did capture my attention and make me wonder about her story.  I say go for it. I have been an avid reader since I was about your age, I am 42 now and am wishing I had the guts at your age to start my writing career.  As it is, I am just now finding the nerve and the time to make my own attempt at fiction writing.  Good luck to you.|`|ff1e69f5b0fdca4411c73634e35831e6aa	I think that your choice of words was great, you did a great job choosing adjectives and placing them in the right place.  I did notice some fragmentation where you said <br>  "Now, the element has taken me with its hypnotic dance. Enthralled me. Cruelly enchained me with searing iron, and etched an ugly pattern into my freshly burned skin."<br>   Don't be afraid of making a run on sentence when you are listing things. It can still create a pause when you just use a comma.  Remember that when you use a period you have to create a whole idea with that sentence.  Other then that, it looked really good to me.

h4kAQm1Daa	Well, I'd assume they were trying to connect to a younger audience. Also, its only a few blocks down from where GMA is recorded, and it's a very secure (and large) location.

bFfWFsFWaa	Okay I'm gonna be honest.<br>     It is not a good idea to name your daughter Lolita. It might be a cute name, and you may have your reasons to naming your daughter Lolita, but when naming a kid, you have to consider the world in which your daughter will be growing up in.<br>   <br>  Lolita is taken to mean two meanings...<br>  <br>  1) Kiddy porn<br>  <br>  2) A female who is of age, but indulges the school girl fantasy in porn.<br>  <br>   And of course, there is the book Lolita, which is a classic, meaning most people have read it, or at least know it's content. You may have not read the book, but it's one of my personal favorites. Although it's a favorite of mine, there is still content in the story that is disturbing.<br>  <br>     You may believe that it would be alright to name your daughter Lolita because you don't see the name as meaning the same meaning as society has. But you must also remember, this girl will be dealing with teachers, and parents of other children. And when she gets old enough to where her age group would be reading the book, she would be dealing with her peers.<br>  <br>  <br>  *edit*<br>     Yes the girl's name was "Daloris Haze" in the book, but she did contract the nickname, which gave the name "lolita" the meaning of child porn. It doesn't take a genius to figure that one out.|`|SkHoZDWPaa	Name her Lolita...maybe she'll get a boyfriend who actually KNOWS what "Lolita" has come to mean.<br>  <br>  I don't mean to say that she'll have a forty-year-old boyfriend when she's twelve...just that maybe she'll date boys who actually have books in their houses instead of barbells.|`|Elxuvon8aa	i like the lalita  lolita kind of has a sexual conotation here in th USA  I do not think it a good idea to use that name|`|2QTktDQsaa	I think it would be wonderful name because it'll give her some background from your Indian roots.<br>  <br>  If I had an Indian daughter, I wouldn't name her Amanda. I would name her something from my country|`|B8Gwxo1laa	My first thought was the movie, and it's negative connotations. I think Lalita is better, also very pretty.|`|lw8n5BFeaa	Hmm, that is a pretty name. I like lalita better, though. lolita is too...flowery for me.|`|CDFz2Yjvaa	So weird I am Indian and was born on May 10 in America. I really like that name. My name is also unique here in America but not in India but I won't tell you it because you might like it better and use it and Then I won't be the only one in America with it! But the name is pretty and pronounceable to people who don't know how to say names (people never say my name right and it ain't even hard)!|`|tyeCsbk1aa	I think it's a wonderful name; but I know about it's connotations, too. And growing up in America, I imagine that name is harassment and ridicule waiting to happen. <br>  <br>   Why not Lalita, like you said, with an A?|`|SS9hE8rnaa	Strangely, apparently none of the people who have answered so far have read the book. The girl's name is "Dolores Haze." Her nickname is Lolita.|`|eZLZ327Caa	Not enough people read classics anymore, so I doubt you'd have much of a problem.  Anyone who does will be mature enough to not give her a hard time about it.<br>  <br>  I love the name, personally.|`|ohj5sRpsaa	I love that name. It's so beautiful. We use that name to refer to someone who is very beautiful and sexy (not sure if you want your daughter to be considered sexy...but it's a compliment!)|`|wKSvnna2aa	The name "Lalita" would be better because it seems "Lolita" has come to be associated with pedophilia or child porn.|`|AbB3zdYwaa	I love the name. So what if the name is forgein? MY name is forgein ( My name is Lila, it means moon in swedish =D)! Go for it. It's beautiful.<br>  <br>  Lolita...|`|caraDLHTaa	lolita or lalita is a beautiful name i think lol her nickkname could be lolly how sweet <br>  sugar n spice and all things nice<br>  anyway the name is gorgeous<br>  ok byebye i hope i helped|`|5eUoENzuaa	First of all, the name Asha you are using is gorgeous, a friend of mine is called that to, and she's half-Indian. :) <br>  <br>  I prefer the spelling of it as Lalita, as it's more original in American culture, and is prettier to look at as a name. :)<br>  <br>  Congratulations on your baby girl! :D

bM9Y79wHaa	Okay so basically Bella thought Jacob had gone, but he was really just hanging around outside the tent. Bella and Edward were talking about the best nights they'd ever had and Edward said hid favourite was the night she agreed to marry him. At this point Jacob didn't know they were getting married and of course he could hear everything they were saying. Jacob still had a faint hope Bella would choose him and not Edward. This is why Jacob was so upset. <br>  <br>  Hope that helps :)|`|LyBiH9sPaa	Because Jacob hadn't known that Edward and Bella were actually going to get married.<br>  Edward was "playing dirty"
FXetWSItaa	Um, I would say "Not really" if I was person number two.|`|B8Gwxo1laa	Nothing wrong with it.|`|KneI3DDRaa	Well, if the person is a tad quirky, or if it is spoken with sarcasm, then I, as the reader, or listener for that matter, would be fine with it.|`|uGmEjSLDaa	In spoken English, it is correct (as sentence fragments), because 'especially' is an adverb that modifies the adjective, 'happy.'

Why to follow a rugged path.<br>  <br>  According to natural law, "Like produces the like". If we are good, nothing bad will happen to us.|`|BlA60kDVaa	Kant argued that moral requirements are based on a standard of rationality he dubbed the “Categorical Imperative” (CI). Immorality thus involves a violation of the CI and is thereby irrational. Other philosophers, such as Locke and Hobbes, had also argued that moral requirements are based on standards of rationality. However, these standards were either desire-based instrumental principles of rationality or based on sui generis rational intuitions. Kant agreed with many of his predecessors that an analysis of practical reason will reveal only the requirement that rational agents must conform to instrumental principles. Yet he argued that conformity to the CI (a non-instrumental principle) and hence to moral requirements themselves, can nevertheless be shown to be essential to rational agency. This argument was based on his striking doctrine that a rational will must be regarded as autonomous, or free in the sense of being the author of the law that binds it. The fundamental principle of morality — the CI — is none other than the law of an autonomous will. Thus, at the heart of Kant's moral philosophy is a conception of reason whose reach in practical affairs goes well beyond that of a Humean ‘slave’ to the passions. Moreover, it is the presence of this self-governing reason in each person that Kant thought offered decisive grounds for viewing each as possessed of equal worth and deserving of equal respect.<br>  <br>  Kant's most influential positions are found in The Groundwork of the Metaphysics of Morals (hereafter, “Groundwork”) but he developed, enriched, and in some cases modified those views in later works such as The Critique of Practical Reason, The Metaphysics of Morals, Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View and Religion within the Boundaries of Mere Reason. I will focus on the foundational doctrines of the Groundwork, even though in recent years some scholars have become dissatisfied with this standard approach to Kant's views and have turned their attention to the later works. I myself still find the standard approach most illuminating, though I will highlight important positions from the later works where needed.|`|Om7OhWRUaa	Well, since "amoral" means "without morals", I'd have to say no. You say that you don't believe in morality, but you clearly do - you just don't know *why* you believe in it.<br>  <br>  You say that because of your ethical choices, "the world becomes a bit of a better place". Maybe you believe in Utilitarian morality? Look into it.|`|AA11488628	yeah. you can also make the truth tell a lie. some people are great twisters of the truth and what they call morals. out of context lots of things can say something that they are not meant to. the poor Bible is one of the greatest of things that has ever been twisted to suit people's agendas. people have killed for it as well as died for it. they have taken its words and told catholic priests and nuns that they cannot marry even though that is not stated anywhere but it is actually written that no man should be alone. really some things have gotten so twisted and polluted by greed, vice, and the crazies that religion has become a nasty word in some people's minds. and that is a great shame.|`|BVf2eAWnaa	Since you are saying you don't believe in morality it would be contradictory to say you believe in it at the same time. <br>  <br>  But I think it is important to separate thinking something is good/bad and feeling something is good/bad. I don't think it's contradictory if you think there's no morality but have moral feelings. I think one always evaluates everything, so for instance feeling you feel happier when doing what feels good and thus feeling you want to do it more, isn't contradictory to thinking there is nothing objectively good/bad. So you sort of can have both that way. I hope that helps!|`|rIzx4OEWaa	You are who you are an nobody knows that better than you.<br>  If you choose to be good an kind without having any moral code then that's fine by me.<br>  But be careful because it is a fine line to tread an can sometimes put you on the wrong side of the law.<br>  I live my life not wanting to do harm to anyone nor do I wish them harm<br>  but it does not mean by my actions they will not come to harm even if indirectly.

y8b86tTEaa	If you are talking about Desert Eagle pistol specifically then the lest damage would be from .357 magnum.<br>  Desert Eagle pistol currently is produced in .357 Magnum, .44 Magnum and .50AE magnum.<br>  Obviously larger calibers have more power and larger bullet diameter. <br>  However, it's not like .357 magnum is something fun at close range. .357 is one of the best man stoppers out there.<br>  <br>  Desert Eagle current model is Mark XIX. Earlier models were Mark VII and before that Mark I. Regardless of the model ammo caliber is the same. <br>  Well, if you want precise record, then there used ot be .41 magnum and .440 CorBon, bot very powerful rounds, definitely more powerful than the .357 magnum.<br>  <br>  For more info check out Desert Eagle Pistol FAQ - <a href="http://zvis.com/dep/dep.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://zvis.com/dep/dep.shtml</a>|`|rcPnnfmmaa	.22 LR subsonic ammo is the least powerful kind commonly used to hit people on purpose.

Mobsters love them too. It won't make a very big hole but if you hit exactly what you were aiming for (the back of the head, for example) you don't need a very big hole.<br>  <br>  There are some very short barreled pistols that will be even less powerful but no models are coming to mind right now. All else being equal a shorter barrel means less muzzle velocity because the powder has less time to burn before it leaves.
090Uv4sKaa	I don't know if there is a purpose to this life. But these are my beliefs:<br>  <br>  Life is just a series of trials and obstacles. Life is tough, and it's not meant to be easy, good or pure. It is what it is. No one has it easy. <br>  <br>  There is some kind of afterlife. I don't know what it is or what it's like, but I know there is one. Because what we live in now, is so completely pointless and limited, that it cannot possibly be all there is.<br>  <br>  I don't know if there is a god - whether it's some kind of machosistic god looking down on us as a kind of sport, players in a cruel game, some spiritualist type who thinks this is all for our own good, or just a force of energy. I believe there's something,  but I definately don't believe in the christian concept.<br>  <br>  So, yes, I believe life is a test.

saYkDVGlaa	Take the images in the early morning,or mid to late afternoon. This will prevent the harsh, overpowering mid-day sun and allow you to set the images vertically.  This will allow you to open your aperture as wide as you can, and keep the entire image within the depth of field.  It will also allow you get even lighting across the paper.  The other suggestion I have may sound odd.  When using the tripod, use the camera's timer to take the image.  The act of pressing the shutter button will create very small vibrations and when looking for the best detail in an image can cause minute blurring.  The timer will allow these movements to stop before snapping the image.  Your white balance cap/gray board should allow your white balance settings to accurate enough to give you true colors.|`|AA11960951	I do have an article that could help you in some way.

LVZdzPmpaa	That's pretty cool. I notice that the symbols assigned to each number change every time you click the center square. It has  to do with the fact that when you subtract the two digits from the chosen number, you end up with a number whose two digits equal nine.<br>  <br>  44 minus 4 = 40 minus 4 = 36 --> 3 + 6 = 9<br>  <br>  32 minus 3 = 29 minus 2 = 27 --> 2 + 7 = 9<br>  <br>  Regardless what number you choose, you end up with a number in which the two digits add up to 9.<br>  <br>  The board changes every time you click the answer square. But notice that each time it changes, all the numbers with the digits that add up to nine (09, 18, 27, 36, 45, 54, 63, 72, 81 and 90) all have the same symbol. So no matter what your final calculations are, you're going to get the correct symbol.<br>  <br>  Regardless, it's pretty cool.|`|PJZRGsc3aa	wow, am i being watched?!|`|96eLvnkTaa	its cool, if you notice any number you tihnk about, when you take the two digits away, its will come to a multiple of 9<br>  <br>  40 | 40 - 4 - 0 = 36<br>  <br>  74 | 74 - 7 - 4 = 63<br>  <br>  so it will always be a multiple of 9<br>  <br>  so if you notice every Symbol for a multiple of 9 is the same so it's mathematically made to give u the correct answer.|`|1o05hQ1Uaa	I think patticharron and Will P basically dominated this answer.

Re4IAXndaa	In Louisiana there are many Moreau's with french heritage.  There are black and white Moreau's.|`|AA12343309	Moreau is French.  Black people in the U. S. generally took their surnames from former slaveholders.  It is possible there are black people with roots in Louisiana named Moreau.<br>  Many of the African Americans there have French names but so do many caucasians.|`|ky3B42f6aa	Although "Moreau" may be French from the start, it is a common name in Ireland.|`|o1BDgJQTaa	it's french i think. "The Island Of Dr. Moreau" is an old sci-fi novel, and dr. moreau is an englishman in it.
OHgqxc7Saa	I've never read the series, but people really seem to like the book Eragon, which is fantasy.  Some books that I liked when I was 13 are The Hobbit, which is really great, unlike the LOTR books which, well, are boring, and this series about bats called Silverwing (I loved those books).  You might want to try Hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy, I've heard that's pretty great too.<br>  I really loved the Tanith Lee series The Claidi Journals, too, the first book is called Wolf Tower.  they're written journal style, which isn't a style I am drawn to, but it doesn't even matter these books were so good.<br>  Oh! His Dark Materials by Phillip Pullman.  The Golden Compass, The Subtle Knife, The Amber Spy Glass.  The movie is nowhere as good as the book at all.  This series is absolutely Fantastic, especially if you are a good reader because Pullman doesn't dumb down his stories like so many young adult authors that think their readers are retarded.<br>  And if you haven't read Madeline L'engle's A Wrinkle in Time & the sequels that go with it (I can't think of the other titles...Many Waters? A Swiftly Tilting Planet maybe?) you really should.  Again, the movie is nothing compared to the book. hands down.<br>  Those were all series I really enjoyed when I was younger, & I was an advanced reader, too who liked fantasy/adventure.<br>  <br>  Just thought of one more: Wicked by Gregory Maguire (again, very different from the musical, & better!) or anything else by him is really great.  I highly recommend Wicked.|`|EnEEMJmYaa	Hmmm, Eragon? Haven't actually read it myself but idk. Also, you should really check out this series by Scott Westerfeld.

tsjLHXzUaa	Nature is nature because of what it is.<br>  <br>  I mean, its nature because its natural.<br>  <br>  For us to conceive of anything else would be UNnatural.<br>  <br>  From the limitations of human reasoning, we could not be comfortable with the naturalness of anything unnatural we can conceive...<br>  <br>  ... all things artificial are "by nature" less perfect than nature itself.|`|AA11217846	There was one a philosophy by Leibniz and his contemporaries that this was the "best of all possible worlds." They believed that natural was perfect, and that everything (even the injustice and death and famine we see in the world) was perfect. Everything had a purpose. Everything was for the best.<br>  <br>  But several people argued against this philosophy. The most famous being Voltaire. After a great earthquake at Lisbon, after seeing all the horror and cruelty in the world, he had to disagree. And so, he wrote the short story, Candide. One of the greatest (and nastiest) examples of satire we have today.<br>  <br>  Personally, I don't think Nature could be more perfect. But it is Man that makes it less-than-perfect.<br>  <br>  It is best if you do some reading, do some thinking, and decide for yourself.|`|0emslEdiaa	If nature was perfect, it wouldn't constantly be evolving.  Only when evolution stops, has perfection been achieved.|`|0lpXN8p9aa	Nature or "What IS", is always perfect until we have a "thought" about It......|`|c677fa97d54fbaa4631202a35cdc2ccfaa	I don't think it could be more perfect. It hangs in a balance. It has contrast and opposites.

rRIiY6Itaa	Depending.<br>  <br>  -If they are advanced they have already spotted us for more before we spotted them. They might be peaceful. If they are, they wont want anything to do with earth. If they are mean. They have probably infiltrated earth already.<br>  <br>  -If they are the same as us they will probably want to get their grubby hands on our technology and our hands on their technology. Thats how ignorant the governments on earth are.<br>  <br>  - If they are not as advanced and are in the mid evil ages. They are probably against themselves and would look at us like gods. However, we would probably overun them and take over their planet because again. Thats how ignorant the earth governments are.<br>  <br>  There would be no war because it would be to easy to wipe us out if they were advanced. Plus they wouldnt waste the resources. I mean us by that to. We could be used as slaves. If they were the same technology as us we might have a war. Though it would be a racial war.|`|Rt4bJfVAaa	Why fight if we can communicate with it.

Think about the U.S. for example.  The country is so divided along partisan lines (the left and the right) that it cannot even unite against terrorism or anything else.  It has never been able to, even in the days of the revolutionary war there was not true unity.<br>  <br>  However, I think that discovering intelligent life would be one of the first steps towards eventual unity.  Perhaps we could learn from them, and develop a peaceful relationship with them...  Hopefully.|`|JoD1BZKqaa	The earth's nations will never be able to unite as one peaceful, holistic state. Human beings just cannot cope in social groups that large - we can barely survive without conflict in our own suburbs and cities. <br>  If NASA do find life or evidence of life that is similar to our own, it is possible that there will be warfare between our two planets. However, I doubt the likelihood of this occurring. <br>  <br>  If life that is so similar to ours exists, it must be quite a distance from our own planet. If it was close, we would have already identified them, or they would have already identified us. Considering this, war would be infeasible and impractical due to the great distances each life system would have to travel simply to reach the other planet, let alone engage with it in warfare.<br>  <br>  The same is true for any allegiances we might make with other planets. Although I think an allegiance is more likely for the research possibilities of combined planets and civilisations, the distance would still be a major hindrance to communications.|`|70503caf06f4695beca81e8a95fd439aaa	I'd say it depends on the threat level. <br>  <br>  The ancient Greeks were far more nationalistic than we are, going to far as to be racist against anyone from another city-state, and barely registering a non-Greek as human. Even they formed a Panhellenic alliance in the face of the invading Persian Empire. <br>  <br>  Of course, if we discover that the alien life form is nothing more than a bunch of bacteria, we probably wouldn't have a very large drive to unite.<br>  <br>  Another problem is that the satellite in question will be no where near powerful enough to detect if there is life on a planet, or determine what kind of life it is. It is going to be observing stars for slight variances in their luminosity; a sign that planets are in orbit around them. The previous method was to detect the wobble of stars due to their gravitational interaction with their planets. This is no where near sensitive enough to detect the presence of life.<br>  <br>  But even if we did somehow discover that there are aliens living on another planet, we simply have no way to communicate with them. Our oldest transmission into space; a speech by Adolf Hitler in the 1940s, has probably gotten as far as Vega by now, which is only 23 light years away, and by now is probably far too hopelessly degenerated for a potential alien to get anything useful out of it. We do have a few interstellar probes floating about, but the odds of an alien civilization randomly stumbling onto it are many trillions to one. <br>  <br>  In any event, assuming that we come up with a Faster Than Light communication/travel method (which some scientists have compared to an alchemist looking for gold); The odds of an alien lifeform being similar to us is infinitesimally small. Even if they are carbon based like us, the results of billions of years of completely different evolution would probably make them far too difficult for either race to comprehend. Not to mention the idea of a similar level of technology to ours is also infinitesimally small as well. Human beings have only had civilization for about 10,000 years, and have only been exploring Space seriously for about 100 years. That's barely a blip on a universal scale. They would likely be either millions of years ahead of us, or millions of years behind us.  <br>  <br>  In the event that there are similarities, ours (and probably, theirs, too) first impulse would probably be to study them. Unless they are overly aggressive, there really isn't a reason for us to want to wage war with them. When you see an animal that you have never seen before, is your first impulse to kill it? Or to look at it and study it visually? I think that it is unrealistically cynical to assume that if we met an alien species, our first impulse would be to wipe it out and take their planet for our own.|`|wDJRyzE9aa	Will the earth unite as one big nation/country, and fight the other planet in hopes of capturing it, and taking over their world?<br>  <br>  Not a chance.
4ab2ea36c0069d71d94055356c32ea00aa	This is going to take practice.  First thing you need is a tape recorder so you can hear yourself and see if it sounds different or the same to other people.<br>  <br>  Next thing to do is learn to do different voices without the ventriloquism.  This will help isolate the technique.<br>  <br>  Do some voice warm up exercises (just google them...there are a ton of sites on that)  Then start.  Start with the extremely obvious ones.  Make an extremely high voice and make an extremely low one.  Throw in some terrible accents- hillbilly, child, French..whatever you can try.  <br>  <br>  If you start with the extremes and move through them, you will come to find some middle ground somewhere in time.
Jbkk7NrJaa	Cliche 1: Zombies usually are formed from an outbreak of some sort of virus, mainly from someone insignificant which passes it on, sometimes its a satellite that crashes to earth with unknown radiation or carrying an alien lifeform that wants world domination! (the latter is more dramatic), ect.<br>  <br>  Cliche 2: Viruses are usually not intentional. Something ALWAYS goes wrong to stir such an event (IE, a vial drops containing some sort of virus, toxins from an experiment are leaked through cracks in the air, a test subject bites an on duty attendant, ect)<br>  <br>  Cliche 3: Shoot them in the head!!! It doesnt take very long, especially in movie, to realize the only way that zombie is going down, is with a well placed Headshot!<br>  <br>  Cliche 4: Zombies are usually depicted as SLOW!!! Slow moving and stupid, their desire is for 'fresh' human flesh (usually BrAiNs)<br>  <br>  Cliche 5: People dont seem to escape. Sometimes we are led to believe the virus has run its course and that theres a certain amount of people infected. And as with cliche 4, most zombies are slow. But oddly enough, not everyone seems to escape for some reason.<br>  <br>  Cliche 6: People are stupid. They lock themselves in a closed room and hope for the best. How does that usually turn out???<br>  <br>  Cliche 7: Sacrifices are made. In many films and books, an important person usually sacrifices themselves for the betterment of his comrades. (Yes, thats for the most part, the black guy o.- )<br>  <br>  Cliche 8: The people dont seem to get along at first. They do though find it in them to stick together and put their differences aside in the midst of a global pandemic!<br>  <br>  Cliche 9: WHAT THE HELL ARE THESE THINGS. Nobody realizes that 'zombies' of all things are out...for their brains... Lets be honest, half the movie is questioning what these strange creatures are (and then the 'oh look, theres my neighbor!')<br>  <br>  Cliche 10: No kids allowed. Where are the kids you ask? Probably immune to the disease for the most part...I guess. But seeing as that really wasnt so in Dawn of the Dead, this one doesnt apply to every movie/book. But seeing hordes of zombies and no 'little ones' trailing along makes me think that either 1. They were eaten first (kids are the most pure...?? Idk.) 2. They are immune to the epidemic  OR 3. The zombies are their friends<br>  <br>  Cliche 11: Maybe its best if we split up...then we meet back here at <insert time here>     Yeah...usually one group does NOT show up. Wonder why?<br>  <br>  Good hunting!

It's a decision left to each individual. While we as individuals die, like skin cells of a body, our species with its general body politic seems to be virtually immortal, so far. What our species eventually evolves into depends upon the collective choices of individuals, but to abandon eventually becoming a divine being could be most properly regarded as "immortal sin".

And all desirable things (which are as numerous in the utilitarian as in any other scheme) are desirable either for the pleasure inherent in themselves, or as means to the promotion of pleasure and the prevention of pain. <br>  <br>  To suppose that life has (as they express it) no higher end than pleasure--no better and nobler object of desire and pursuit--they designate as utterly mean and grovelling: as a doctrine worthy only of swine, to whom the followers of Epicurus were, at a very early period, contemptuously likened, and modern holders o the doctrine are occasionally make the subject of equally polite comparisons by it German, French, and English assailants. <br>  <br>  According to the opponents of utilitarianism, as far as the pleasure is concerned, we the humans and swine are the same. Against this contention, Mill contends that the pleasure of the human-being is totally different from that of the beast, that is happiness. For the human-beings possess more elevated faculty than the animal appetite, and when once made conscious of them, do not regard anything as happiness which doe not include their gratification. <br>  The pleasures of the higher faculties uniquely human are more satisfactory and of greater happiness than those of the lower faculties, according to Mill, and at the same time, those who possess the higher faculties are equally capable of the greater pains and sufferings. <br>  <br>  It is better to be a human being dissatisfied than a pig satisfied; better to be Socrates dissatisfied than a fool satisfied. And if the fool or the pig, is of a different opinion, it is because they only know their own side of the question.

Only kidding of course, since I don't know you from Adam.<br>  <br>  What is the point of life?  A big question that can only be answered one way.  God's love.  There is no other way or the whole existence of the universe doesn't make sense.<br>  <br>  For me personally I believe that love gives value to both people and other living and nonliving things.  Did you realize that?  And also the only creative force in this world is brought in through love.  A person's desire and wish and passion is love for what they are creating.  God's love is so expansive and so big he builds an entire universe just to place our earth in it.  God's love for man is so astonishing that he was willing to live as a man, and to die at the hands of man, and still love man.  Enough so that he man can live eternally with God.  <br>  <br>  Love connects all living things so that God who sees two sparrows in the air or a fox in a field or all the gorilllas in the world loves and cares for all living people.  For love gives man words to live by.  Love gives man wisdom to understand the secrets of the universe so that he can help himself and his fellow man.  Love sees all other things that exist in all the other planets and stars in the universe.  No one can comprehend God.  No one can comprehend love.  No one can comprehend God's love.  No value of anything is seen unless it is through the eyes of love.<br>  <br>  This may not make sense to you.  It is unearthly.  But show this picture to a couple of people who truly love one another and they can see this picture.  It is magic.  It is freedom.  And most important of all.  It is the truth.<br>  <br>  The point in life is to love God because God first loved us.|`|mEpS4cfXaa	alright so from a biological point of view we have three main drives 1: Survive   2:Reproduce  3: Better Ourselves over others<br>  <br>  whatever you do in between or within those three realms is what makes you, you<br>  <br>  make your life what you want of it...i guarantee that no matter how hard you try or lack there of, you will never avoid these 3 things...it is human nature|`|o9FLtMbdaa	God created us to be with Him.

One ant has no power, but when there are many of them, they can be very effective, and they can even destroy a large animal.<br>  <br>  A person is like a drop of rain with no power, but when the raindrop emerges in the ocean its meaning changes and it becomes the ocean with much power.<br>  <br>  I think the biggest challenge that we face as humans is to recognize and overcome our ego and its desires so we can live in peace until we die.|`|fhOlbSWaaa	=*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  Dear friend,<br>  Please read my ANSWER CAREFULLY and follow the links, books & Videos, all free of charge, which provided below …<br>  =*=*=*=*=*=*=*=<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  THE TRUTH OF THE LIFE OF THIS WORLD (Video)<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1276" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>  <br>  Wickedness, injustice,grief, pessimism,trouble, loneliness, fear, stress, frustration, distrust, unscrupulousness,anxiety, rage, jealousy, resentment, drug addiction,immorality, gambling, prostitution, hunger, poverty, social corruption, theft, war, struggle, violence, oppression, fear of death…News about these issues appear in the newspapers and on TV every day.The popular press devotes entire pages to these subjects, while others serialise articles about their psychological and social aspects. However,our acquaintance with these feelings is not limited solely to the press; in daily life,we,too,frequently come across such problems and, more importantly, personally experience them. <br>  People and societies endeavour to liberate themselves from the distressing experiences,disorder and repressive social structures that have prevailed over the world for long periods. <br>  We only need to glance at ancient Greece; the Great Roman Empire; Tsarist Russia, or the so-called Age of Enlightenment, and even the 20th century-a century of misery which saw two world wars and world-wide social disasters. No matter upon which century or location you concentrate your research, the picture will not be appreciably different. <br>  If this is the case, why haven't people succeeded in solving these problems, or at least some efforts been made to remove such social diseases from society?<br>  People have encountered these problems in all ages, yet each time they have failed to find any solutions because the methods they employed were inappropriate. They sought various solutions, tried different political systems, laid down impracticable and totalitarian rules, stirred up revolutions or subscribed to perverted ideologies, while many others preferred to adopt an indifferent attitude and merely accepted the status quo. <br>  In our day, people are almost numbed by this way of living. They readily believe these problems to be "facts of life." They picture a society immune to these problems as being nothing short of impossible-a dream utopia. They persistently and openly express their distaste for such a way of living, yet easily embrace it, since they think they have no other alternative. <br>  The resolution of all these problematic issues is possible only by living by the principles of the "true religion." Only when the values of true religion prevail can a pleasant and tranquil scene replace this gloomy and unfavourable picture, which is doomed to continue so long as God's limits are ignored. To put it another way, people are enslaved by these complications as long as they avoid the values of the Qur'an. Put simply, this is the "nightmare of disbelief" and the link below for this wonderful book:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download.php?WorkNumber=256&Format=pdf" rel="nofollow">http://fs.harunyahya.net/popup/Download....</a><br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  you will find how the regulation of life by the "norms of morality" introduced by the Qur'an revealed to mankind by God will banish the "nightmare of disbelief," how pessimism, corruption and social restlessness can be eliminated from society, how the individual can surround himself with an ideal environment, what spiritual and material benefits he is likely to attain by adherence to these norms of morality are gone into in detail, and finally, that the unique alternative to all these problems is the morality of the Qur'an. <br>  So far, many books have attempted to deal with the social and psychological problems societies face. Yet, what distinguishes this book from others is its stress on the most realistic solution. It also sincerely warns people against the troublesome future they are likely to face if they fail to resort to this solution. <br>  We expect that every reader of conscience will grasp that peace, mutual trust and an ideal social life is attainable only by embracing the values of the Qur'an and will turn to the true religion, which is Islam. <br>  They will then happily join the ranks of those who never suffer, mentally or physically, from any of the above-mentioned complications. Around them, there will always be an abundance of favours, comfort, love, respect, peace and confidence, and moral virtues will prevail. They will know how to earn God's approval, by observing His limits and the commandments of the Qur'an. They will thus, by having faith in God, attain His mercy and at last enter Paradise. <br>  <br>  Useful link:<br>  (A BRIEF ILLUSTRATED GUIDE TO UNDERSTANDING ISLAM)<br>  <a href="http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.islam-guide.com/islam-guide.p...</a><br>  <br>  DEEP THINKING (VIDEO):<br>  <a href="http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDetail.php?dev-t=EDCRFV&objectId=1124" rel="nofollow">http://api.fmanager.net/api_v1/productDe...</a><br>   <br>  <br>  =* FOR ANY HELP FEEL FREE TO E-MAIL ME ON *=<br>  smiling4ever222@hotmail.com|`|g6bBORHxaa	Most religions are just a way to get people to conform or are just an answer to distract us from our fear of death. Material things can give you temporary happiness but you will never be satisfied with what you have so its a never ending quest for happiness. Death is inevitable. I figure just live your life however you want just don't be tied down by how other people live or how you are expected to live. What actually makes you happy in the end is the postive memories in your life and all the good things you have done for people. Existance is only sad if you have bought into false hopes your whole life and have come to realize that everything might be a lie. I believe humans are just animals with reason and higher cognative abilities. One thing is for sure: nothing is for sure.

yJdhhzypaa	SMeyer says venom. If that's true, it would have destroyed Bella's uterus, rather than impregnate her. I don't think vampire "venom" would be capable of impregnating a human, unless it had the same properties of semen. However, it seems that the same kind of venom runs throughout vampire bodies and serves numerous functions that blood, semen, tears, and other liquids in the human body would. Which is strange. I mean, the same venom used as a substitute for semen is running through your veins? Yeah, that's...eww.<br>  <br>  The plain fact: she just wanted them to have a child so Jake could get a love interest and everyone could like happily ever after.|`|cKuHXJQyaa	i guess it's just another flaw in her writing.<br>  i never really thought about it until people started bringing it up, then i noticed that he can't technically get bella pregnant.<br>  <br>  that's one of the many question i'd love to ask stephenie meyer if i had the chace; she never really gave an answer to that part of the story.|`|95M9WTqoaa	its a fictional book therefore anything the author wants to happen can happen.<br>  its about vampires and they arent real so why shouldnt she be able to write about one getting a human pregnant?<br>  that is what fiction is all about.|`|hko5xsH4aa	Stephenie Meyer is a fooooool...<br>  <br>  This is another flaw...<br>  <br>  u.u<br>  <br>  You're right.

First off, I think he's still considered "living" in the way Stephenie Meyer wrote it. I guess in some books with vampires they are considered dead but the ones SM wrote about I think are living.  Anyways, maybe SM didn't think anyone would go that far into thinking. I guess that just shows how hard it is to fit all the details together but close enough haha. Like for another example, this is kinda weird, but seriously, when girls have a period, wouldn't the vampires be attracted to the blood?|`|TDRmuub6aa	If you take your time and re-read Breaking Dawn you'll find your answer. But I'll tell you. Men are pretty much the same from puberty to death, therefore he had sperm. He had sperm for another reason too, he couldn't have lost it through his changing process because it changes the heart. And Bella is Human and can bear a child. Also Edward has learned to control his thirst. BTW Twilight is awsome! Meyer has no mistakes.|`|euB892Hwaa	I've wondered the same thing.<br>  I mean, I get that it's Meyer's story but she should at least think about what vampires are and the whole legend behind them. They are dead, common knowledge. Their blood doesn't pump; again, common knowledge. No blood pumping = No erection.|`|KvBA8wS3aa	Who cares really, its just a story, and it was enjoyable enough to read.

It makes no biological sense.<br>  <br>  Meyer did say herself that they only thing inside a vampire is the venom and there's no way that the venom can be like sperm and do everything else that Meyer says it does.<br>  <br>  @princess_laura715: You obviously know nothing about basic biology. Sperm doesn't live forever, it makes no logical or biological sense that Edward's sperm would have survived in his cold body for over a hundred years. It would have eventually died and since Edward was dead, his body wouldn't have produced any more.

We need to decrypt the message and make some decisions.<br>  The first decision is; do we want to control our lives, or rely on outside forces. The second is whether we believe that causes produce effects.<br>  <br>  This document is intended for those who want to control their lives and accept that causes produce effects. The question naturally occurs, “What are the right causes to optimize life for oneself and others?” The causes must be based on what is pragmatically verifiable, yet universally true. <br>  <br>  Please write down all the words of intangibles that attach to life such as love, imagination, dreams, life, hope, fear, hate etc. Then write down all the words that relate to the tangible aspects of life. The list of tangibles and intangibles is endless in English. However, the inseparability of tangible and intangible aspects is summed up in the Japanese words Myoho.  Why use Japanese words? The concept originated in Japan and can’t be expressed as well in another language.<br>  <br>  Write down all the words for causes you can think of and effects those causes can have. They are all summed up in the words Renge-Causes simultaneously produce effects like the flower and the seed of the lotus.<br>  <br>  Everything is always changing. Write down all the words that come to mind about things changing-Clouds, faces, butterflies, concepts, memories and on and on. They are all summed up in the Japanese word Kyo. Because everything is always changing, no one is stuck where shehe is. <br>  <br>  The three words Myoho Renge Kyo include every aspect of life. <br>  <br>  This formulation serves as a life decryption key.<br>  Add the shortened Sanskrit verb for focusing intention and create Nam Myoho Renge Kyo. This, spoken repeatedly with the palms pressed together, focuses the mind-brain-body on the essential realities. It releases delusions and limitations as reliably as vitamin C cures scurvy.

(inbreeding over thousands of years would be a major problem. Plus the Neanderthal/human cross is prohibited by the DNA) That's the same problem with Bigfoot.

e31a690779239ea8cd46fcbe573867d1aa	Canon and Nikon both make great camera's. You may get a lot of answers suggesting one brand over the other but the fact is they are both fine cameras. <br>  <br>  I am going to suggest the Canon and here is why. The Canon will accept all of the EF and EF-S lenses. The Nikon D60 and the D40 are the only camera's Nikon makes that don't have the auto focus motor built into the camera body. This means you have to use the few lenses they make for these bodies. All their other AF lenses can only be used in manual focus. <br>  <br>  If you are just going to use the camera to shoot snapshots I would say it doesn't matter. They are both very sharp, one is not better than the other, but if you want to use wide angle and fisheye's the Canon may meet your needs a little better.|`|k8AcVixTaa	I have a Nikon D60 as well as a D40.

Both are decent for new photographers- although I will give you this piece of advice: the D60 is not too different from the D40. In fact, it's pretty much the same thing, but carries a higher price tag. Go with a D40 if you want Nikon and invest the difference into lenses.<br>  <br>  If you go with Canon, I personally recommend the xTi over the XS...again with the difference into lenses. Both systems have good lens systems, so you can't go wrong there.<br>  <br>  Sigma/Tamron are some of the 3rd party lens suppliers that cater to Canikon, Sony, Pentax, and Olympus users. Some people prefer their wide angle's over Canikon's, but that's up to you to decided. Oh, and final word since many people forget this: read the manual when you get your new DSLR and take it off auto mode now and then...otherwise get a nice P&S and save your money.<br>  <br>  Best of luck,<br>  the Grouch|`|pZGLhV2Waa	They are both fine. It really doesn't matter. I did want to point out though that fisheye and wide angle lenses are very expensive. Expect to pay more than you pay for the camera for each lens. The Canon 10-22mm wide angle $700 the Nikon 12-24mm wide angle $869, the Nikon 10.5mm fisheye $700. Canon does not currently make a fisheye for their APS-C sized DSLR's so you would have to buy a third party lens. The Tokina 10-17mm fisheye is $530. Just thought you would like to know.|`|ysbmM3Tcaa	Get the Rebel XS for sure.Nikon would be my second choice for sure though.

Both are excellent cameras.  I am partial to cannon but that is just my preference.|`|aRIA86D8aa	Have you thought about buying a digital video camera (camcorder)? Most new video cams will take still shots while you're recording. <br>  <br>  If no for the video cam - have you compared the prices of all the accessory stuff? That would include: memory, extra battery/s, lenses, filters, and software. Canon lenses tend to be more expensive but the quality is almost never in question. Nikon lenses are less expensive but not by much and the quality is most often just as good. The difference might be the quietness of the Canon lenses; Nikon lenses tend to be louder but the difference for skateboarding is negligible.

yvyewZrWaa	I prefer crime novels - preferably in the murder-mystery vein. Espionage books can be good, but too frequently they lapse into overly-complicated plots and long stretches of action with running from bombs and Nazis and double-agents and whatnot (at least in the spy books I've encountered). Well-written crime books generally hold more interest (for me, in any case) because they delve a little deeper into human psychology. The aforementioned authors are great, though Agatha Christie with her ingenious twists and quirky detectives continues to be my favorite.|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	Spy stories are tough to pull off convincingly, you almost have to have actual field experience as a spy or have a secret source in the CIA to convince the reader.   John LeCarre and Ian Flemming had actual spy experience, but LeCarre is much better at writing of it.<br>  <br>  Crime stories are a bit more interesting, in my opinion, and you have a wider range of possibilities.

AA12343309	Trying to trace your name isn't the way to learn your heritage.  You start with yourself and work back one generation at a time.   <br>  <br>  My answer is lengthy and I apologize for that but I want to warn you of the advantages and the pitfalls of genealogy on the internet. We get your question many time a day. So I have cut and am pasting an answer.<br>  <br>  Here is a link to various websites, some free, some not<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene..." rel="nofollow">http://www.progenealogists.com/top50gene...</a><br>  <br>  Websites that only have family trees are not worth a tinker's curse unless you are willing to verify the information with documents/records. They are subscriber submitted, very seldom documented and if they are they are poorly documented. You frequently will see the different info on the same people from different subscribers. Then you will see the absolute same info on the same people from different subscribers but you would be very foolish if you thought for one moment that that means it is correct. A lot of people copy without verifying. The information can be useful as clues only as to where to get the documentation.<br>  <br>  Right before Christmas of 2008, I found out I was dead. So was my sister and my brother-in-law. We died in New Jersey. Since the only time my sister and I were ever in New Jersey is when our family drove through it coming from New York in 1957. It was the same year Hurricane Audrey hit in our part of the world. Hey! we had been dead for 51 years. It says so on the internet. It has to be right if it is on the internet!<br>  <br>  I found out that family on both sides married and died in New Jersey. Since my ancestry is mostly southern American colonial with some exceptions and those exceptions came in through southern ports, I was surprised.<br>  <br>  This tree would have been accepted by any genealogy website. You can make up an entirely fictitious family tree and it will be accepted. You disagree with something someone has on one of your family members, the websites will tell you that it is between you and the other subscriber.<br>  <br>  Now the best for the total amount of records online isn't free but your public library might have a subscription to it. That is Ancestry.Com. Still be careful about the information in their family tree, particularly their One World Tree program.<br>  <br>  CyndisList.com is a website with links to many other websites, some free and some not. Many people involved in genealogy find it helpful.<br>  <br>  Not all records are online but the ones you will find will save you time and money traveling to courthouses, libraries etc.<br>  <br>  However your first free source is your own family. Get information from them. Tape your senior members if they will let you. People who do this state they go back and listen to the tape again after doing research and hear things they didn't hear the first time around. I am not saying they won't be confused or wrong on some things.<br>  <br>  Find out if anybody in your family has any old family bibles. Ask to see and make copies of birth, marriage and death certificates. Depending on the religious faith, baptismal, first communion, confirmation and marriage certificates from their church can be helpful.<br>  <br>  A good free source is a Family History Center at a Latter Day Saints(Mormon) Church. They have records on people all over the world, not just Mormons. In Salt Lake City, they have the world's largest genealogical collection. Their FHCs can order microfilm for you to view at a nominal fee.<br>  <br>  They won't try to convert you, at least they haven't done so to me or anyone else that I know. Just call the nearest Mormon Church or visit their free website, FamilySearch.org, to get their hours for the general public.<br>  <br>  Rootsweb and FamilySearch.org are 2 free sites but remember verify information in family trees with documents/records. If you don't you don't know whether it is accurate or not.|`|XTmiI44laa	Your parents should be able to tell you who your grandparents are, what they did for a living etc.<br>  <br>  After you have got your grandparents info then you need to start ordering birth and marriage certificates, that is the only way with a common name such as Brown or Smith|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	If your grandparents are alive and mentally competent, ask them who their grandparents were - names, maiden names, birth, marriage and death dates and places.

shVgCizBaa	EFFECTS OF KENNEDY AND WHITE'S "CAMELOT" MYTH DISCUSSED<br>  <br>       Calling former First Lady Jacqueline Kennedy "an iron-<br>  willed and ferocious guardian of her husband's legacy," Joyce<br>  Hoffman described the collaboration between Mrs. Kennedy and<br>  journalist Theodore White that gave birth to the "Camelot<br>  myth" in the weeks immediately following the president's<br>  assassination, and what it has meant to our nation. Professor<br>  of Journalism at Old Dominion University, Ms. Hoffman<br>  discussed her recent book, "Theodore H. White & Journalism as<br>  Illusion", at a U.Va. Miller Center forum Nov. 28.<br>  <br>  Jacqueline Kennedy summoned the Pulitzer Prize-winning<br>  journalist to the family compound at Hyannisport only a week<br>  after her husband's death. Teddy White had become a confidant<br>  of the President during the 1960 campaign, and she implored<br>  him to "rescue" Jack Kennedy from "the bitter old men who<br>  write history." <br>  <br>  As Mrs. Kennedy struggled to find what she considered an<br>  appropriate "classical metaphor" for her husband's presidency,<br>  Teddy White slowly abandoned his journalistic objectivity and<br>  became a willing collaborator in the creation of a heroic<br>  national myth, according to Ms. Hoffman. In the echoes of a<br>  favorite Broadway musical of the time, Jacqueline Kennedy<br>  found her heroic metaphor and cast the spell of Camelot over<br>  the American people with the help of Mr. White.<br>  <br>  As Ms. Hoffman noted, seldom would the collaboration of myth-<br>  seeker and myth-maker ever be quite so unconditional. White's<br>  essay, just 1,000 words long, became a defining document in<br>  American's political and cultural life, she said.<br>  <br>  The durability of the Camelot myth, even in light of subsequent<br>  revelations about the Kennedy years, remains a tribute to the<br>  vision and determination of the former First Lady. Professor<br>  Hoffman stressed that Jacqueline Kennedy and Teddy White did<br>  not create the Camelot myth simply to aggrandize a fallen<br>  president, but also out of a genuine sense of national need.<br>  Seeing the nation locked in a desperate, dangerous Cold War<br>  struggle with the Soviet Union, Kennedy and White believed<br>  that a heroic national myth would help the U.S. prevail. Mrs.<br>  Kennedy's strong desire to rename Cape Canaveral after her<br>  husband was evidence of her wish to impart the power of the<br>  Camelot myth to America's space race with the Soviets, Ms.<br>  Hoffman said.<br>  <br>  What the Camelot myth obscured, she explained, was "the<br>  reality that Kennedy won the presidency with one-tenth of one<br>  percent of the vote" and that at the time of the assassination,<br>  his administration was still stained by the Bay of Pigs fiasco<br>  and shaken by the brinkmanship of the Cuban Missile Crisis.<br>  <br>  The Camelot myth was "ultimately harmful to the Kennedy<br>  years," Ms. Hoffman believes. "The notion that the New Frontier<br>  was some lost golden age certainly robs that period of<br>  balanced judgments." In later years, Jacqueline Kennedy was<br>  herself trapped by the idyllic memory she had created for her<br>  husband and remarked that the choice of Camelot was<br>  "overwrought," noted Ms. Hoffman. While sympathetic to the<br>  ideals and determination that motivated both Jacqueline<br>  Kennedy and Teddy White, Ms. Hoffman judges that the Camelot<br>  myth was "too grand an idea for our nation." <a href="http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/textonlyarchive/95-12-08/4.txt" rel="nofollow">http://www.virginia.edu/insideuva/texton...</a>|`|djNeNEOuaa	Camelot, a Broadway musical about the court of King Arthur and his knights of the Round Table, opened in December 1960, just weeks after JFK's election. <br>  The Kennedy Administration  was compared to that imaginary place with high ideals, chivalry and knights in shining armor of this medieval legend. Thus his time in office is known as the Camelot years.|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	Camelot was the home of England's legendary King Arthur.

wvkidaY9aa	Trench warfare helped shape the outcome in that it made the out come dependent on one thing: whoever could fight the enemy despite the trenches would win. But this takes a little explaining. <br>  First, trench warfare helped modernize warfare in the way that it showed that the old ways of waging war wouldn't work with new technology. At first, the armies tried to fight the way that they had during the Napoleonic wars: you form two lines and try to shoot each other. In the end, all they did was mow each other down and die themselves. This was due to the development of much more accurate rifles and machine guns. So what did they do? They hid from the line of fire in trenches. However, it's impossible to fight a war inside a ditch. So, they tried running over towards the enemies ditch. This led to the development of razor and barbed wire. They tried to get the enemy out of the trenches so that they could shoot them. This led to the development of gas bombs (mustard and others). This in turn led to the invention of gas masks and other protective clothing. Then, they tried the tactic of killing the enemy while they were in the trench. This led to grenades, shell/mortar, and the launchers for all that. However, in the end, the biggest thing that came out of trench warfare? The tank. So your enemy puts up razor wire? Wire can't cut metal.<br>  So the enemy throws a gas bomb at you? The gas is too heavy to reach the breathing holes. It was the answer to all the difficulties off trench warfare.<br>  Thus, trench warfare led to the true modernization of war. Whoever could find the technology first would win.|`|shVgCizBaa	The more common tactic was to attack at night from an advanced post in no man's land, having cut the barbed wire entanglements beforehand. In 1917, the Germans innovated with infiltration tactics where small groups of highly trained and well-equipped troops would attack vulnerable points and bypass strong points, driving deep into the rear areas. The distance they could advance was still limited by their ability to supply and communicate.<br>  <br>  The role of artillery in an infantry attack was twofold. The first aim of a barrage was to prepare the ground for an infantry assault killing or demoralising the enemy garrison and destroying his defences. The amount of time these initial barrages lasted for was varied, ranging from seconds to days. The problem with artillery bombardments prior to infantry assaults was that they were often ineffective at destroying enemy defences and only served to provide the enemy with advanced notice that an attack was imminent. The British barrage that began the Battle of the Somme lasted eight days but did little damage to either the German's barbed wire or their heavily-fortified concrete bunkers where the defenders were able to see out the bombardment safely. Once the guns stopped the defenders knew that the infantry were about to emerge and were usually ready for them. The second aim was to protect the attacking infantry by providing an impenetrable "barrage" or curtain of shells to prevent an enemy counter-attack. The first attempt at sophistication was the "lifting barrage" where the first objective of an attack was intensely bombarded for a period before the entire barrage "lifted" to fall on a second objective farther back. However, this usually expected too much of the infantry, and the usual outcome was that the barrage would outpace the attackers, leaving them without protection. This resulted in the use of the "creeping barrage" which would lift more frequently but in smaller steps, sweeping the ground ahead and moving so slowly that the attackers could usually follow closely behind it. Capturing the objective was half of the battle, but the battle was only won if the objective was held. The attacking force would have to advance with not only the weapons required to capture a trench but also the tools—sandbags, picks and shovels, barbed wire—to fortify and defend from counter-attack. The Germans placed great emphasis on immediately counter-attacking to regain lost ground. This strategy cost them dearly in 1917 when the British started to limit their advances so as to be able to meet the anticipated counter-attack from a position of strength. Part of the British artillery was positioned close behind the original start line and took no part in the initial bombardment, being saved to support the advancing troops as they moved beyond the range of guns further back.<br>   Breaking the deadlock<br>  Throughout World War I, the major combatants slowly groped their way towards the tactics necessary for breaking the deadlock of trench warfare, beginning with the French and Germans, with the British Empire forces also contributing to the collective learning experience. The Germans were able to reinforce their western front with additional troops from the east once Russia dropped out of the war in 1917. This allowed them to take units out of the line and train them in new methods and tactics as stormtroopers (Stosstruppen). The new methods involved men rushing forward in small groups using whatever cover was available and laying down covering fire for other groups in the same unit as they moved forward. The new tactics (intended to achieve surprise by disrupting entrenched enemy positions) were to bypass strongpoints and attack the weakest parts of an enemy's line. Additionally, they acknowledged the futility of managing a grand detailed plan of operations from afar, opting instead for junior officers on the spot to exercise initiative. These infiltration tactics proved very successful during the German 1918 Spring Offensive against Allied forces.<br>  <br>  Conceived to provide protection from fire, tanks added mobility, as well. As the Allied forces perfected them, they broke the deadlock. While not effectively employed at first, tanks had tremendous morale effects on German troops in the closing stages of the war on the Western front. The average infantryman had no anti-tank capability, and there were no specialized anti-tank guns. Once tanks began to be used in concentrations, they easily broke through German lines and could not be dislodged through infantry counterattack.<br>  <br>  During the last 100 days of World War I, the British forces broke through the German trench system and harried the Germans back toward Germany using infantry supported by tanks and close air support. Between the two world wars these techniques were used by J.F.C. Fuller and B.H. Liddell Hart to develop theories about a new type of warfare. The ideas were picked up by the Germans, who developed them further and put them i|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	More than anything else, trench warfare helped increase the death toll.

There were probably not so many different denominations, but Episcopalians, Catholics, Lutherans, Baptists, etc. People would never have gone to church in jeans, women would have always worn a dress or skirt and blouse. While most weren't as fanatic as Catholics about hats, most ladies wore hats to church and even white gloves-even in the summer. <br>  <br>    And it was a mixed bag compared with today.

It is also a common prefix in Dutch surnames - specifically, a "tussenvoegsel" — as in Vincent van Gogh or George Vancouver. It can appear by itself or in combination with another prefix, such as van de, van der and van den (current and archaic forms of the article 'de' (the)) and less commonly van het or van 't (the neutral article 'het'). The German 'Von' is a cognate of Dutch 'van' but unlike the German 'von', the Dutch 'van' is not an indication of nobility. These prepositions usually refer to a (mostly geographic) place.

I did find this from Wikipedia<br>  <br>  English Civil War<br>  Further information: English Civil War<br>  The English Civil War broke out in 1642, largely as a result of an ongoing series of conflicts between James' son, Charles I, and Parliament. The defeat of the Royalist army by the New Model Army of Parliament at the Battle of Naseby in June 1645 effectively destroyed the king's forces. Charles surrendered to the Scottish army at Newark. He was eventually handed over to the English Parliament in early 1647. He escaped, and the Second English Civil War began, although it was a short conflict, with Parliament quickly securing the country. The capture and subsequent trial of Charles led to his beheading in January 1649 at Whitehall Gate in London. A republic was declared, and Oliver Cromwell became the Lord Protector in 1653. After he died, his son Richard Cromwell succeeded him in the office but soon abdicated.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Restoration of the monarchy<br>  The monarchy was restored in 1660, with King Charles II returning to London.<br>  <br>   <br>  King Charles I, who was beheaded in 1649In 1665, London was swept by a visitation of the plague, and then, in 1666, the capital was swept by the Great Fire, which raged for 5 days, destroying approximately 15,000 buildings.<br>  <br>  After the death of Charles II in 1685, his Catholic brother King James II & VII was crowned. England with a Catholic king on the throne was too much for both people and parliament, and in 1689 the Dutch Protestant Prince William of Orange was invited to replace King James II in what became known as the Glorious Revolution. Despite attempts to secure his reign by force, James was finally defeated by William at the Battle of the Boyne in 1690. However, in parts of Scotland and Ireland Catholics loyal to James remained determined to see him restored to the throne, and there followed a series of bloody though unsuccessful uprisings. As a result of these, any failure to pledge loyalty to the victorious King William was severely dealt with. The most infamous example of this policy was the Massacre of Glencoe in 1692. Jacobite rebellions continued on into the mid-18th century until the son of the last Catholic claimant to the throne, (James III & VIII), mounted a final campaign in 1745. The Jacobite forces of Prince Charles Edward Stuart, the "Bonnie Prince Charlie" of legend, were defeated at the Battle of Culloden in 1746.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] 18th and 19th centuries<br>  <br>  [edit] Formation of the United Kingdom<br>  The Acts of Union between the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland in 1707 caused the dissolution of both the Parliament of England and Parliament of Scotland in order to create a unified Kingdom of Great Britain governed by a unified Parliament of Great Britain.<br>  <br>  The Act of Union of 1800 formally assimilated Ireland within the British political process and from 1 January 1801 created a new state called the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, which united the Kingdom of Great Britain with the Kingdom of Ireland to form a single political entity. The English capital of London was adopted as the capital of the Union.<br>  <br>  <br>  [edit] Industrial Revolution<br>  Main article: Economic history of Britain<br>  During the late 18th and early 19th centuries, there was considerable social upheaval as a largely agrarian society was transformed by technological advances and increasing mechanization, which was the Industrial Revolution. Much of the agricultural workforce was uprooted from the countryside and moved into large urban centres of production, as the steam-based production factories could undercut the traditional cottage industries, because of economies of scale and the increased output per worker made possible by the new technologies. The consequent overcrowding into areas with little supporting infrastructure saw dramatic increases in the rate of infant mortality (to the extent that many Sunday schools for pre-working age children (5 or 6) had funeral clubs to pay for each others funeral arrangements), crime, and social deprivation.<br>  <br>  The transition to industrialization was not wholly seamless for workers, many of whom saw their livelihoods threatened by the process.

Almost everyone thinks their family is descended from royalty or Native Americans, or thinks they have a family crest, but both are actually highly unlikely.

nQ3kFPMVaa	Check out local auditions at theatre.asn.au, or read up on Aussietheatre.com. If you're keen, pay for a membership at QuietOnSet.com.au or Artshub.com.au; they list heaps of auditions every day around Australia. Another good site is screenhub.com.au.<br>  <br>  My best advice is to visit the first link, head to the FAQ section, and read about finding agents in Australia, how to find work, etc. It also has a lot of stuff about dodgy Aussie agents to avoid. There's heaps of free info there for new actors, and is practically the best place you can find info for emerging actors. There's also a huge list of companies that you can search by suburb. If you're in a small town, you may have to create your own group with friends, fellow students or even general townsfolk. When you're ready, ie. 18 or older, think about moving.<br>  <br>  AGENTS DO NOT COST MONEY - IF THEY ASK FOR FEES UPFRONT, THEY ARE DODGY.<br>  <br>  Visit www.alliance.org.au, the actor's union for Australia and join.<br>  <br>  If you don't have experience don't expect a professional role or an agent. I suggest you use the next years to build up experience, stay in school, do drama in year 11 and 12, do amateur shows, extra-curricular classes, and then try applying for a local uni course. Trust me, there are too many actors out there and not enough roles. Everyone wants to be in Home and Away and Neighbours; very few actually do it.<br>  <br>  Those Aussie actors who are in Hollywood have spent the better part of 20 years developing their career - first in Australia, and then overseas. Do yourself a favour; take some classes and do some shows first.<br>  <br>  Think about attending WAAPA, NIDA or VCA or one of the many great courses out there (there are heaps) when you're ready.<br>  <br>  There's a lot of indie films being made in Australia, for which you can audition for without an agent; check the first link for examples, or Quiet On Set.<br>  <br>  DON'T sign up for one of those American talent sites. They are scams and never have anything for Australian auditions.
spYpsixUaa	1. There is a fly on the wall in the corner of a dark room in the upstairs attic in my mind which is pondering philosophical questions like "Why would Thales think that everything is made of water?" There is another fly on that same wall which is pondering the smell of rotting tomato sauce rising up from the floor and wondering if he should fly down to it and try to eat some of it. On the facing wall of these two flies is a spider who is pondering the tasty effort of chasing them down and eating them.<br>  <br>  2. Work, work, work! Perpetuating the species is neither a sensical nor nonsensical thing to do. It's the genetic purpose of living beings. Even plants do it. The purpose of procreation (i.e., the meaning of Life (******* **** *** *** *** **** ******** ** *** ****** ********* *** ***** ** ****** ********* ** ******* *** *** ***** **** ***** ******* ** ***** *****)) is an individual effort, almost a competitive struggle. "I procreate so that my progeny can outnumber the other guy's progeny." That's what procreation is all about. Life itself and the fact that we have brains is merely something to pass the time inbetween children. Gee, that's kinda depressing. I'm glad I disagree with it.<br>  <br>  3. ******** doesn't have any religion. Should I be afraid of you? There is a tiny little earthworm crawling up out of the drain in my bathtub swirling around in the ceramic basin, squirming in the light with all the stinging soap-stains, and I look down at it and wonder, "What is the point of your life? You're not ********. I'm not afraid of you! You're nothing but a little worm!" Contradiction: No Religion, but "life is so godless." Oh, I get it. You're a paradox!<br>  <br>  4. If you can say "Cogito ergo Sum," a predatory carnivore will be tempted to eat you!<br>  <br>  5. Yet another in the continuing struggle of the 42-ish quandary of conundrums! Is it time for yet another visit to ******.*** for yet another mail-order copy of that amazing technological invention (The Electronic Book-like device which has a huge yellow smiley face on it that calmly advises each reader, "Don't Panic!"? Yes, the supposedly science-fiction notion of a paperless book in a portable electronic format is in fact a reality now. Does this constitute an existential crisis for Reality? What happens when the realm of science fiction becomes real objects readily available on the market? When Sci-Fi becomes reality? Am I going to be walking down the hall at work Monday to meet ******* ******* and ******* ***** arguing about philosophy with those delightfully quizzical looks on their faces? Yes, Go To ******.***.

Haven't you ever seen ***********? It's the same thing, except we're not dead! Have some more coffee. Oh, and look. They gave me this cool mousepad with the Corporate philosophy printed on it!<br>  <br>  7. The dogs roam the streets in a cantankerous herd, packing like gerbils and swarming like birds, bellowing like vain breezes in trees, a soundless howl against the icy winds of Winter in a midwestern cornfield, waiting for the imagined horror that to arrive, and looking for strange lights in the skies (while we enjoy a peaceful reverie noticing the shape of Orion's bow and arrow), and yet we toil in the soil mining for gold as we age mercilessly wailing at the waning of our lives.<br>  <br>  8. We exist because we are here, and our sense of duty is determined by society. In an existentialist view, our meaning / purpose / value in Life is merely living it. Sometimes people recite the blind optimism that Life is a gift that should be cherished, but when you go to bed alone and stare at the ceiling, you get pretty saddened when you have to disagree and say that "It just is." Sometimes people spout the famous aphorisms, unhelpfully, "Go where you're most needed when you're most needed." and "Help others, join a charity, etc." Others will spew contempt at you for posting a question which could conceivably be searched in the *** Indexes (The White space in the Green bar just below the Banner sign on the screen), but sometimes the point of posting the question yourself is the magic of having somebody talking directly to you.|`|380b53c18cfb9588bad18dd0f231a984aa	1.

I've (almost) worked with freelance videographers before, and while I'm sure there are good ones out there, it's my experience that people who don't do auditions generally have such awful material that they can't get actors...and I don't want my name on anything substandard.

376abf017f5ceda0dc7a5f6414b42db2aa	1) My favorite book out of the series so far would have to be Shadow Kiss. Too many important things happen in that book. And all of the good things that happen outweigh all the bad for me.<br>  <br>  2) I think Rose will go to Siberia and meet up with Dimitri's grandmother. I also think Lissa will learn to dreamwalk. I'm hoping that Lissa will also learn to be more independent as well.<br>  <br>  3) My favorite characters are Rose, Dimitri, Eddie, Christian, and Mason in no particular order.<br>  <br>  4) There's no competition in my mind. VA trumps Twilight by a mile. :)|`|A6ylS5bJaa	1: Vampire Academy is my favorite out of the series. I like how Richelle Mead introduces us to the characters, how she explains her unique vampire world, and how she sets it up so well for the rest of the series. I love how she explains the beginnings of Rose and Dimitri's relationship.. . I just love it. <br>  <br>  2: My personal belief is that Dimitri will, somehow, stay himself after he transforms- that he heard Rose screaming for him, and that was what stayed in his mind as he changed. I think Rose will either go looking or him in Siberia, [[the obvious belief as they'd discussed his homesickness, but overall too sunny for a Strigoi,]] or with Tasha, [[I just have a feeling he might go there.]] I think that Dimitri will follow Rose as she looks for him, keeping her safe. Or, option 2, will take control of the Strigoi, kicking a** taking names etc. When Rose watches the first fake gaurdian attack,she says, "Dimitri was  bada** Strigoi," which is probably foreshadowing. I think there will be a big battle between Rise and Dimitri, that Dimitri, with his new abilities, can beat Rose, gets her to where he could kill her, but can't...or the other way around. <br>  <br>  3: <br>    1:Dimitri<br>    2:Adrian<br>    3:Christian<br>    4:Mason<br>    5:Janine<br>  <br>  4: I dunno which series is better, I love them both.. . However, they are vry different... I'd have to go with Twilight though... It's just, written better than Vampire Academy I guess, the plot line is deeper- that's a really hard question and it's SO close...

ceBTTCPwaa	The Haunting of Hill House (not to be confused with Richard Matheson's novel Hell House, made into a film titled The Legend of Hell House) is a 1959 novel by author Shirley Jackson. Considered one of the finest literary ghost stories published in the twentieth century, it has often been compared to Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw and Stephen King's The Shining, a novel which was partially inspired by it.[citation needed] Jackson's novel relies on terror rather than horror to elicit emotion in the reader, utilizing complex relationships between the mysterious events in the house and the characters’ psyches.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/The_Haunting_of_...</a> : Includes The Haunting of Hill House summary, character analysis, themes, style, historical context, critical overview, essays, media adaptations, compare and contrast, topics for further study, and sources.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Haunting_of_Hill_House" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Hauntin...</a>

XuFmnqSpaa	I really wish she would, it would be so much better that way!!<br>  <br>  But I do not believe she is going to, because on the book it says, The Host, a novel by Stephenie Meyer. Novel as in only one book. Also, at the end, it did tie up loose ends. Like, Mel got her body back and got to be with Jared, and Jamie, of course. Wanda got a body of her own, and had a the old Host sent to a new planet. And she got to be with Ian, and of course, Jamie. There was no foreshadowing in any of that at all.<br>  <br>  Actually, I think it would be better if Stephenie did write another book to this, though. I'd like to see more of life in the caves, and how they got along, and maybe even a little more conflict.<br>  <br>  So, in all olf this, my final answer would be no, I do not think that Stephenie Meyer is going to write a sequel to The Host. <br>  <br>  Hope this helps!!|`|fpuHVNYgaa	Maybe Smeyer will,I didn't read it.|`|EnEEMJmYaa	I don't think so because the ending didn't foreshadow anything since Mel got her body back and Wanda was put into a new one and both Mel AND Wanda were able to be with their boyfriend/loved one/whatever.|`|9rekPBIdaa	She won't write one but i wish she did

KHSOVxViaa	It seems to be part of human nature that a proportion of people feel the need to have such beliefs.<br>  <br>  The nature of religion has usually been well integrated into national or tribal consciousness and identity.  People are born, and grow up in an environment where peer pressure teaches them about society's view of life, the universe and everything.  Religion is often a major part of this.<br>  <br>  It's only relatively recently that it's possible to think 'outside this box' and to consider explanations and codes of conduct that do not require a deity or god-given code.  Such a change is not like a light switching on suddenly; it's a slow process.  This means it is still unthinkable and anathema to many that there may not be a god and the universe is not how their religion describes it.<br>  <br>  People dislike ground-shaking change away from values and beliefs with which they feel secure and comfortable.  Think of the consternation when Galileo postulated that the Earth was not the centre of everything.  It took hundreds of years for much religion to catch up with recognising such evidence.<br>  <br>  To give up such deeply-held views is often much too big a change for many people to make at present, but history is long..|`|644fe9633265c82afa8cdeb71d97a23daa	If you truly believe that your actions will send you to heaven or to hell, there's a big motive to make sure you don't screw up.|`|AA10359994	Religion can transform people's way of thinking and even to the point where their religion is all that matters in their lives.

Its mimicking another player's work.

Avoid tabs at all costs, usually they are incorrect or incomplete.  Learning from ear will be an invaluable help to your playing.  I recommend leaving the bass in an accessible place, since playing 15 minutes every day is better than playing an hour and 45 minutes every week.  Learn songs that appeal to you, and try to come up with some stuff on your own.
14ea9B55aa	That really does depend on wether you are refering to the BBC version with Collin Firth as Mr. Darcy, or the most recent one with Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. Personally, I think that the BBC version did an excellent job of portraying the characters and settings in the film, the acting was superb and there was an almost perfect portrayal of all characters. As for the most recent one, I think that it struggled to accurately comprehend the plot and characters, especially due to the acting of Kiera, who I believe did not behave in an extremely "ladylike" manner, which is of course one of the main traits of Elizabeth in the novel.|`|fgxajTiBaa	I've actually never read the book, but I have seen the BBC and the Keira Knightley version of the movies.<br>  <br>  I couldn't stand the Keira Knightley one, no one fit any of the characters and I felt like it was all too fake.<br>  <br>  I could imagine that the novel is very similar to the BBC.

They capture what needs to be captured- the overall idea of each character. The novel obviously has more detail than the movie, so you see more descriptions in the book of the characters, so the actors have to take everything in the novel and put it out on camera.<br>  <br>  The movie stayed true to the plot, but I didn't really expect anything different. Obviously it lacks a little detail with the story, but what movie doesn't?<br>  <br>  By the way, I hope you meant the Keira Knightley version, because that's the movie my answer is based off of.|`|AA10829445	You ask "What similarities do you think the novel and movie "Pride and Prejudice" have in common?

I'm going to give you the list of versions with 2 reviews:  1st for the 1940 movie with Sir Lawrence Olivier & Greer Garson and the 2nd for the BBC 1995 one.<br>     1.  <br>  Pride & Prejudice (2005)  <br>   <br>  2.  <br>  "Pride and Prejudice" (1995) (TV mini-series) <br>   aka "Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice" - UK <br>  3.  <br>  Pride and Prejudice (1940) <br>  <br>  REVIEWS:(from IMDB)<br>  <br>  1st 1940:<br>  <br>  Viewed solely as a movie, this version of "Pride and Prejudice" is quite enjoyable, and has plenty of strengths. Since it was adapted from a stage play that was in turn based on the novel, it is perhaps inevitable that there would be a lot of differences from the original, both in the characters and in the events (plus a few anachronisms). Most of the time, these fit in all right with the story, but it is hard not to feel that it would have been an even better film if they had stayed closer to the original in the later parts. In all honesty, though, none of this prevents it from being a very good movie in its own right.<br>  <br>  2. 1995 BBC MOVIE:<br>  It is rare to find a Jane Austen dramatisation that comes so near to being perfect on every level and that stays so true to the original novel. The greater part of the dialogue in the series is Jane Austen's own and every scene is included and follows the same chronological order. The drama departs from the novel in only two instances. In order to extend our knowledge of the characters of Darcy(Colin Firth), and Mr Collins(David Bamber), two scenes are added; to demonstrate that Darcy is not just an effete aristocrat but a real man worthy of Elizabeth's love we are shown him indulging in manly pursuits; fencing, and swimming in his private lake (it puzzles me why so many women seem to drool over his wet-shirt scene); and to demonstrate that Mr Collins is an idiotic, narrow- minded prude we are shown him trembling with embarrassment and horror when he happens to come across Lydia (Julia Sawalha) in a state of dishabille. David Bamber makes Mr Collins deliciously toadying and obsequious. A remarkable piece of acting.<br>  <br>  It is its faithfulness to the original that makes this drama so good. No one has ever written a more tightly plotted novel. Its series of climaxes make the novel difficult to put down; just as one plot-line reaches its climactic conclusion, another is building. And the duel of wits and sharp dialogue between Darcy and Elizabeth (Jennifer Ehle) as they get to know each other is entrancing. And then comes that moment. She is at the piano befriending Darcy's sister, Georgiana (Emilia Fox), when he holds her gaze with a silent declaration of his love and admiration. This involved a fine piece of editor-timing; a split second either way, either too long or too short, and the poignancy of that moment would have been lost. It is interesting to compare Colin Firth's Darcy with that of Lawrence Olivier's Darcy in the Hollywood film. Olivier falsely portraits him as appealingly shy and self-conscious. But Darcy was in no way shy, he was just proud, with every reason to <br>  have a good opinion of himself. He found it impossible to imagine that anyone in a lower strata of society, living in a small provincial town, could be his equal - until he met Elizabeth!<br>  <br>  3.  You can easily find reviews on the 2005 movie with Kiera Knightly which I found intolerable & uncomfortable to watch after seeing the 1995 version about 5 times.|`|CRuxWsi0aa	I wrote a paper on this last summer. Do you mean the Colin Firth one or the Keira Knightley one?<br>  I'm gonna go with Keira.<br>  The costumes were not accurate at all.<br>  Obviously, there wasn't nearly as much detail.<br>  The scene where Darcy runs into Elisabeth is different.<br>  That's all I can remember now.

AA12343309	DNA testing might help. However, a company that only uses Y & Mitochondrial will only give you results for a tiny part of your ancestry.<br>  <br>  There are 3 types of DNA tests.<br>  <br>  Y which goes from father to son only<br>  <br>  Mitochondrial which goes from mother to both sons and daughters but only the daughters pass it on to their children.<br>  <br>  Autosomal which is what most of your DNA is and you get it 50-50 from both parents.<br>  <br>  If you only have your Y & Mitochondrial done, right off the bat it will exclude your paternal grandmother and maternal grandfather. If you get back to your 6xgreat grandparents, you come from 510 individuals. Of those 510 individuals you get your Y from only 8 and your Mitochondrial from only 8 leaving out 494 people.<br>  <br>  Y & Mitochondrial are good for people in family history who want to match themselves with other family trees as they both go back in a straight line virtually unchanged. One company that only uses Y & Mitochondrial advertises that they will help you discover "your deep ancestral roots." It is true they will show you the origin of your nomadic ancestors going back thousands of years, but it is ONLY in 2 lines and they can tell you specifically in those 2 lines ONLY where your ancestors came from. You come from a myriad of family lines, not just the 2 that you get your Y & Mitochondrial.<br>  <br>  There is one company that will take your Autosomal DNA and match you with population groups throughout the world and show you your top matches. They won't tell you you are 1/2 of something, 1/4 of something else and 1/4 of another something else. What they will do is show you your top matches. The same DNA crosses national, ethnic and racial boundaries. FamilyTreeDNA does do Autosomal testing but they won't give you an analysis. I think at one time they did. I had to send my Autosomal results from FamilyTreeDNA to DNATribes to get an analysis.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.DNAtribes.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.DNAtribes.com</a><br>  <br>  When you go into their website if you go under "feedback" there is a way you can email them and ask questions.<br>  <br>  I asked DNATribes if my sister with whom I share both parents had the same Autosomal test would her results be the same and they replied.<br>  <br>  "Two siblings will each obtain unique results. Family members do typically share some regional or ethnic affiliations, but in some cases matches can vary substantially between siblings."<br>  <br>  While you get your Autosomal 50-50 from both parents, you don't get it 25-25-25-25 from grandparents. You get 50% from your paternal grandparents and the same from your maternal grandparents, but it isn't even steven between grandfather and grandmother.<br>  <br>  Now, I can see if there is more than one company doing this type of Autosomal testing you can get different results if one company does not have some population samples that another company has.<br>  <br>  Here is a company that does Y & Mitochondrial for free. They won't send you a report but you they will put your results on their website and you can feed your results into Ancestry.Com's website and get an analysis.  It took them about 6 months for me to get mine back in 2007.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.smgf.org/pages/how_it_works.jspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.smgf.org/pages/how_it_works.j...</a><br>  <br>  This is a good link explaining DNA<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/060293.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pa.msu.edu/~sciencet/ask_st/0...</a>|`|05bddf168eeb3e8ae67ab005844309abaa	Look in the mirror. Your race is Caucasian, African or Asian. It may be a mix. If you want to be more precise, split African into African and Australian Bushmen (Y!A asterisks out "Knee-grow" for some reason), and split Asian into Asian, American Indian and Malay-Polynesian.<br>  <br>  Race is just a handy way to sum up physical appearance, as in "The lost hiker is a [white / black / asian] male, 12 years old, 5'6", 135 pounds . . .". If you mean ethnicity, because your mom was Albanian and your dad a Zulu, (or some other, more probable mix) re-state your question.|`|7ZeT3Krkaa	Your race would be black, white or Asian.  Your nationality depends on the country you were born in.  Your heritage is where your parents, grandparents, great-grandparents, etc. were born.  Any site that would give you access to census records will tell you where they were born, as that was one of the questions on them.  And not just for the head of the household and the family members, but the parents, too.  You would have to have some idea of where they lived, and when they were born, as well as children's names to make sure you have the right person, though.<br>  Ancestry.com has access to all census records, from the first one in 1790 through the 1930.  Genealogy.com or familysearch.com might also have that access.  You can enter what information you have on most of them, to begin your own tree.  Be careful about adding information from other contributors if there is no documentation cited, as they have probably not checked things out, just accepted someone else's word for the information.  It may not be accurate.<br>  The internet makes it easier to access information, and you can save some time by not having to get out and drive many miles to look at records, but it also makes it easier to get false information into the trees of a lot of people.|`|096429d0b8a1276c6a855e7990dbd550aa	<a href="http://www.dnaancestryproject.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.dnaancestryproject.com/</a>

The firearm equipped peasant armies that, as in Europe had humbled the elite in battle, were disbanded and the samurai returned to the hereditary principal in a form stricter even than the period before.

If Athens were to produce such a great man then i think it wasnt all bad. America isnt a great place neither based on its historical track record. taking Natives land and reducing them to a fraction of what they were, slavery, then after that was rectified segregation. id say only after the late 70s was that America was the beacon of democracy that it is today.so, to answer your question, not that different, if we could acquit OJ,we could concievably convict some great man like Socrates.|`|AA10729675	Maybe the laws would be different indeed, but the joyfulness of the Athenian life would be a huge compensation that we might overlook.

W1h3w5gdaa	Well, don't forget that sheet music is copyrighted material. It's very rare to find free (legal) versions of songs that are less than 70 -120 years old or so. (I'm not kidding; copyrights extend for 70 years past the death of the author.)<br>  <br>  That being said, I've seen links to sheet music here for songs I'd have though were copyrighted. The original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory came out in 1971. The song you're referring to was written by by Leslie Bricusse and Anthony Newley, and they're both still alive, age 77, so you've got a while to wait.<br>  <br>  If you don't actually need the sheet music and just need to learn the song, you can surely find a copy of it somewhere and learn it by ear.<br>  <br>  Best of luck, although I'm sure this isn't what you wanted to hear.

Both are actually considered "Christian" authors, but both have written some really amazing books, there are adult and children's versions of some of their books--double the reading material. Just read Ted Dekker's "Three" and it was amazing--I couldn't put it down--stayed up until 3 am reading it a couple nights. <br>  <br>  Charlaine Harris--she has several series going and only one is "retired"--that the Lily Bard novels. There's Sookie Stackhouse, which is the basis for HBO's "True Blood", Auroa Teagarden mysteries, and Harper Conelly mysteries. Those should keep you busy for a few days. This author is the only one who actually made me fall off my bed laughing. I mean, I was reading one of her books and was literally ROTFLMAO. <br>  <br>  Sherrilyn Kenyon's Dark Hunter Series--I'd lost track of them so bad that I bought a couple of them twice by mistake--there's several of them.<br>  <br>  Melanie Jackson has a series about faerie--I've got a bunch of them, and they're pretty good.<br>  <br>  Christine Feehan--Her vampires are called "Carpathians" but you'd probably like them--there's a bunch of those, too.<br>  <br>  Lyndsay Sands--Single White Vampire is hysterically funny, I think. Some of the rest are good and some are just okay, but it's more to read. Her vampires are actually from Atlantis. Kind of a cool take on the myth. <br>  <br>  Amanda Ashley has a whole series of vampire novels too--some are good, some are cute. I think the first few older ones are the better romances, but that might just be me.<br>  <br>  Angela Knight--She has an interesting take on the vampire myth. Her books are kind of a refreshing change. <br>  <br>  Chelsea Quinn-Yarbro--the grand dame of vampire novelists--her Conte de Saint-Germain is a very interesting character and her writing is exquisite. Her vampire is neither Brams Stoker's creature of horror nor the caricature that is the modern, fashionable myth. Hers is something different and ageless and more interesting. There is very little sex in these novels--they seem to have been written mostly for younger readers, but the stories and the history of the places and people her character sees are wonderfully described. When St. Germain is in Rome just before the fall and is caught up in a political intrigue that threatens to expose him and cost him his life, the tension is just amazing. Lovely, wonderful storyteller. <br>  <br>  That should hold you for a little bit. Oh, I did leave out the darker and more depressing novelists that I've read. Not knowing your age exactly, you probably don't need those anyway and with everything going on in the world I'd say hold off on the depressing stuff until we're all a little better armed against it, you know. The ones I listed, I think I'd have handled when I was 16-18--if I've guessed wrong and the first of the series has too much "romance" for you, don't bother with the rest of them in that series. In each of these cases, the first one is about how the rest of them go. <br>  <br>  Happy reading.|`|daza5A4vaa	What's with the caps?<br>  I don't know..<br>  But my advice is to go ahead and start reading it.<br>  If it makes you uncomfortable, you can always put it down.|`|K3YKF9fBaa	Sookie Stackhouse Series is pretty good.

shVgCizBaa	The Sit-In Movement<br>  <br>  Students from across the country came together to form the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and organize sit-ins at counters throughout the South. This front page is from the North Carolina A&T University student newspaper.By 1960, the Civil Rights Movement had gained strong momentum. The nonviolent measures employed by Martin Luther King Jr. helped African American activists win supporters across the country and throughout the world.<br>  <br>  On February 1, 1960, a new tactic was added to the peaceful activists' strategy. Four African American college students walked up to a whites-only lunch counter at the local Woolworth's store in Greensboro, North Carolina, and asked for coffee. When service was refused, the students sat patiently. Despite threats and intimidation, the students sat quietly and waited to be served.<br>  <br>  The civil rights sit-in was born.<br>  <br>  No one participated in a sit-in of this sort without seriousness of purpose. The instructions were simple: sit quietly and wait to be served. Often the participants would be jeered and threatened by local customers. Sometimes they would be pelted with food or ketchup. Angry onlookers tried to provoke fights that never came. In the event of a physical attack, the student would curl up into a ball on the floor and take the punishment. Any violent reprisal would undermine the spirit of the sit-in. When the local police came to arrest the demonstrators, another line of students would take the vacated seats.<br>  <br>  <br>  To challenge laws that kept interstate bus trips segregated, black and white students organized freedom rides through the South. The first such ride was interrupted when an angry mob attacked riders and destroyed their bus during a stop in Alabama.Sit-in organizers believed that if the violence were only on the part of the white community, the world would see the righteousness of their cause. Before the end of the school year, over 1500 black demonstrators were arrested. But their sacrifice brought results. Slowly, but surely, restaurants throughout the South began to abandon their policies of segregation.<br>  <br>  In April 1960, Martin Luther King Jr. sponsored a conference to discuss strategy. Students from the North and the South came together and formed the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Early leaders included Stokely Carmichael and Fannie Lou Hamer. The Congress on Racial Equality (CORE) was a northern group of students led by James Farmer, which also endorsed direct action. These groups became the grassroots organizers of future sit-ins at lunch counters, wade-ins at segregated swimming pools, and pray-ins at white-only churches.<br>  <br>  <br>  By sitting in protest at an all-white lunch counter in Greensboro, North Carolina, four college students sparked national interest in the push for civil rights.Bolstered by the success of direct action, CORE activists planned the first freedom ride in 1961. To challenge laws mandating segregated interstate transportation, busloads of integrated black and white students rode through the South. The first freedom riders left Washington, D.C., in May 1961 en route to New Orleans. Several participants were arrested in bus stations. When the buses reached Anniston, Alabama, an angry mob slashed the tires on one bus and set it aflame. The riders on the other bus were violently attacked, and the freedom riders had to complete their journey by plane.<br>  <br>  New Attorney General Robert Kennedy ordered federal marshals to protect future freedom rides. Bowing to political and public pressure, the Interstate Commerce Commission soon banned segregation on interstate travel. Progress was slow indeed, but the wall between the races was gradually being eroded.<a href="http://www.ushistory.org/us/54d.asp------------------------" rel="nofollow">http://www.ushistory.org/us/54d.asp-----...</a><br>  The sit-ins were very significant to the movement. They symbolized a change in the mood of African-American people. Up until then, we had accepted segregation — begrudgingly — but we had accepted it. We had spoken against it, we had made speeches, but no one had defied segregation. At long last after decades of acceptance, four freshman students at North Carolina A&T went into Woolworth and at the lunch counter they "sat-in." When told they would not be served, they refused to leave and this sparked a movement throughout the South. Black students in colleges throughout the South saw it on television they said "Hey man, look at what our brothers and sisters in Greensboro are doing. What's wrong with us? Why don't we go out and do the same thing?" And they went out, so it swept across the South like the proverbial wildfire, with students rejecting segregation. With their very bodies they obstructed the wheels of injustice. <br>  <br>  In the North, in addition to sending people down to hold institutes of non-violent training ... we boycotted the variety stores, the so-called 5 and 10-cent stores, Woolworth, Kress, Grant and so on. We put picket signs in front of the stores in the Nor|`|dc2cb706f625bf4f0720140360b38e90aa	The effect was to create awareness of the issues.  During the movements for Civil Rights, the racial tensions could turn heated at a lunch counter, but what was a store owner to do?  Worse, what was a national chain supposed to do?    Strength in numbers was the key to success.
ceBTTCPwaa	Wide Sargasso Sea is a 1966 postcolonial parallel novel by Dominica-born author Jean Rhys. After her last work, Good Morning, Midnight, Rhys lived in obscurity before Wide Sargasso Sea was published in 1939. This work put Rhys into the limelight once more, and became her most successful novel.<br>  <br>  The novel acts as a prequel to Charlotte Bront?'s famous 1847 novel Jane Eyre. It is the story of the first Mrs. Rochester, Antoinette (Bertha) Mason, a white Creole heiress, from the time of her youth in the Caribbean to her unhappy marriage and relocation to England. Caught in an oppressive patriarchal society in which she belongs neither to the white Europeans nor the black Jamaicans, Rhys' novel re-imagines Bront?'s devilish madwoman in the attic. As with many postcolonial works, the novel deals largely with the themes of racial inequality and the harshness of displacement and assimilation.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.bookrags.com/Wide_Sargasso_Sea" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookrags.com/Wide_Sargasso_Se...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sargasso/" rel="nofollow">http://www.sparknotes.com/lit/sargasso/</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monkeynotes/pmWideSargasso02.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.pinkmonkey.com/booknotes/monk...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/Titles/sargasso" rel="nofollow">http://www.gradesaver.com/ClassicNotes/T...</a>

Montreal Canada; french, English, Persian.|`|b6hid42iaa	u have NONE!|`|F8rY3DDZaa	Try heaps of different things from jigsaws to rock climbing and more.

Maybe it's one of those...|`|2cuAzNgXaa	I know this may not be the type of answer you are looking for but, your talent will find you...|`|2ODH17tWaa	MrNick2D,<br>  I read what you have written and have a few answers and/or advice for you. First of all, don't feel alone in the world, or anywhere. One way to find friends is to look for people who have the same interests, that is also a good way to find talents... some peoples talents will not seem as important as others, but we all have one. Some times things just take practice.<br>  <br>  For a long time I tried Swimming at our local Y, my brother (who is two years younger then me) passed me up in the next level. I tryed many other sport activitys, and he was always better then me. But I have always loved Singing, and acting, I almost always particapate in my church, and School, plays. My brother has never been good at either of those, and I found some pride in that, I have also been much better at writting then him. These I excpect to be my talents... but I always search for any other possibilitys. <br>  <br>  Now I am sure you are thinking, good for you! I can't do any of that! But I can tell you now! I didnt get good at any of that right away! I had to practice it, I hated some of it for a wile, but after I got it, after I understood it and everything, I loved it! <br>  <br>  Now that I have written this long thing, I want to fully answer your question. There are many ways to find your talent, but the easyest way for me... is taking something you like, and practicing it, people wil tell you, you suck, at first. But ignore them! Because after you practice a little, you might just end up being better then them. And you didnt really ask this, but I thought it might help. One good way of making friends... say in you school, is looking for the new kid, the other lonleyest person... I'm sure if you look hard you can find one. Maybe you see some one looking upset? Instead of thinking "they don't want to talk to me" Go up and ask them what wrong, if you can help them in any way. You might get a nasty reply, but then again you might become friends... its worth a shot right? I hope through this long speach of mine, that you picked something up, and that I helped a little. Thanks!

AA11898755	It is from either an imbalance in the lean to fat progression when the painting was executed or, from the sound of it from incorrect storage or moving made the canvas buckle or torque causing the paint film to break. <br>  The degree to which it is a problem depends on which it is. If its the first and the painting is young (less than 20 years) it probably means more and worse "crazing" to come. If its the latter then simply keeping it out of direct sun and not allowing it to be moved will retard the spread of cracks.<br>  Crazing in a young painting can dimenish the value, but artists like Gerhard Richter have heavily crazed canvases that are unaffected in terms of value. It is just considered part of the aesthetic and is dealt with. Genius goes a long way to forgiving flaws for which others are derided.

r2j5kf9Eaa	It's probably powdered paint, e.g., non-toxic tempera paint.  In the olden days tempera was made from eggs, so it shouldn't do any long-term damage even if it gets in the eyes or mouth.  These days they probably make it from something else, but it's still considered non-toxic.  At least the ones I buy.  I used to buy powdered all the time but switched to liquid a couple years ago when the local art store stopped carrying powdered.

It's going to take you a long time and a lot of effort, and you better not take no for an answer.<br>  <br>  If you just want to see your name in the headline of an Off-Broadway play, you got a decent shot. It takes persistence either way.<br>  <br>  Just be aware, you're starting a little late in the game. You're going to have competition with kids that grew up in local theatres and playhouses. One of my best friend's parents own a community theatre, and you can't tell the difference between her acting and her genuine personality. So you need to be focused, and you need to never take a day off. Every day you should find a way to better yourself. You've got some catching up to do.<br>  <br>  Just make sure that you don't just go for "good jobs." Gigs come in all shapes and sizes, and you'll need experience. Start in local shows, find theatre companies that need understudies. Work your way up.

6pszwwl7aa	Yes. Simply because there is about 9 million ways to do the conversion. All have subtle differences. Too many to list, but trust me there are tons of different ways to do this. I would suggest just shooting in color, and then experiment with the many, many different ways to convert that. You will like some techniques over others. You will like some for a certain type of photo, and others for other types of photos.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freephotographytutorials.blogspot...</a>|`|j5Apt8hWaa	You get about 1/3 the detail if you use the black and white (monochrome) feature ... better to shoot everything in high resolution RGB colour and later "process" only the images you want in to black and white image files ... be sure to save the modified images as a different name, so you don't overwrite your fine original<br>  <br>  Some DSLR's have some retouching features on-board so you can produce black and white, sepia or Cyanotype images, but when you do that, they are saved as a different image file, so your original is protected.|`|eVptHOOBaa	Yes - there is a difference.<br>  <br>  When you shoot B+W in camera, the camera immediately throws away all color information, leaving just shades of black. Once it's done, there's no going back.<br>  <br>  If you shoot in color, and then use a good post processing software, you will have lots of options on just how to turn the image black and white. For example, you may play with different color channels (red, white, blue) to decide which channel, or what kind of mix of the three you want to use to create more dramatic and/or soft, or vivid, or whatever your artistic ambitions dictate kind of effect. Finally, you may take a second look and decide to actually keep it in color!<br>  <br>  So, you will have much more flexibility and as a result a better outcome if you shoot in color, and then convert to black and white. The only con to this method - you won't see actual black and white until after you've converted. Well, and more work for you at a computer, but it's worth the result!<br>  <br>  LEM.

b2dfb747ff97024c25f406d5a48a0d2faa	You want to take a picture of yourself for MySpace?  Okay, here you go.  Just go into the bathroom and take a picture in front of the mirror.  Oh yeah, and be sure you turn on the flash and hold the camera at a 45-degree angle.  It also helps if you shake the camera, so that you get that nice blurry effect that everyone likes when they take "pics" for MySpace.  Gee...Isn't that what most pictures look like on MySpace??<br>  <br>  Okay, seriously.  If you want to take a decent picture of yourself, then you need to put the camera on a tripod or something else flat and steady, and then set the timer on your camera.  Do NOT use a mirror.  That's the worst way to take a picture of yourself.  Also, try to take a picture with interesting surroundings, and be sure you have enough light.  Natural light is usually best, so think of somewhere outside where you can take the picture.<br>  <br>  Don't use a flash unless you absolutely have to, and if you do...don't get too close to the camera.  If you use a flash too close, it will overexpose your face and ruin the color balance, and you'll look like you're glowing white.  The foreground will be overexposed, but the background will be pitch dark.  <br>  <br>  The most important things to remember...do NOT use a mirror, use the timer on the camera.  And be sure you have enough light.  Also, try to avoid using the flash, and if you do use the flash, do NOT get too close to the camera.|`|RfgtQHmhaa	Okay, this one is simple.<br>  Check if your camera has a timer setting.<br>  If it does, set your camera up on a table or a flat surface and press the button.<br>  Stand in front of the camera.<br>  <br>  Voila! :)<br>  <br>  <br>  If your camera doesn't have a timer setting, ask a friend to take a picture for you?|`|smrCnOITaa	Yeah .<br>  Just Hold The Camera In Front Of Your Face And Press The Button , Then Walla , You Have A Picture .<br>  Then You Can Just Put It On Myspace Using Your USB Cord .<br>  Hope I Helped !<br>  ???<br>  - Clair|`|S15ffaE8aa	Turn the camera around.. and take a risk.. delete it is it stinks.. then take another one.<br>   good luck..|`|c326cfe5cf69517a634a3da544203fd3aa	...<br>  hold the camera<br>  in front of your face.<br>  lens pointing at you.<br>  click the button.<br>  you get a picture.<br>  go to your myspace.<br>  upload it.|`|132ff297b62eb99a8d50e82064fff91baa	how dont i myspace a picture take myself of my myspace?

Then you can read hundreds of questions and answers you will find about this exact same thing, since this question is asked here every single day, at least 20 times a day.|`|C77c0OE2aa	You can use GIMP for selective coloring. It is free to download.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://gimp.org" rel="nofollow">http://gimp.org</a><br>  <br>  Here is the procedure:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/SelectiveColorization/" rel="nofollow">http://www.gimpguru.org/Tutorials/Select...</a><br>  <br>  Here is another method that is somewhat easier than the GIMP tutorial referenced above. This is written as pertains to Photoshop, but the same procedure should work in GIMP with possibly some slight changes in tool names. <br>  <br>   First open your photo in your editing program..<br>  <br>   Then go to Layer - Duplicate Layer<br>  <br>   Click OK<br>  <br>   Then go to Image - Adjustments - Hue / Saturation<br>  <br>   Drag the Saturation slider all the way to the left to make the photo black and white.<br>  <br>   Click OK<br>  <br>   Then get the ERASER tool from the tool box on the left side of the screen. It is usually the next tool under the clone stamp tool. Just hover your mouse over the tool, and it will say Eraser.<br>  <br>   When you have selected the Eraser, go up to the Brush options box at the top of the screen, and click on the downfacing arrow. Set the Hardness of the brush to 100% so you will have accurate control of selection. You may also need to raise or lower the brush size to suit.<br>  <br>   Erase away any black and white from where you want the color to be revealed.<br>  <br>   When done go to<br>   Layer - Flatten Image<br>  <br>   Then just do a Save As to wherever you want to save the photo.<br>  <br>  steve|`|RfgtQHmhaa	There's several graphic design programs such as Adobe Photoshop that you can download for 30-day trials or buy online (www.adobe.com)<br>  Once you have the program you can use the Lasso tool to select whatever you want to keep in color, then go to Select > Inverse, then Image > Adjustments > Desaturate.|`|a1xU4KsOaa	Ah, the trendy thing to do on Facebook and Myspace.

EBrgRBT3aa	Igor Stravinsky was one of music's truly epochal innovators; no other composer of the twentieth century exerted such a pervasive influence or dominated his art in the way that Stravinsky did during his five-decade musical career. Aside from purely technical considerations such as rhythm and harmony, the most important hallmark of Stravinsky's style is, indeed, its changing face. Emerging from the spirit of late Russian nationalism and ending his career with a thorny, individual language steeped in twelve-tone principles, Stravinsky assumed a number of aesthetic guises throughout the course of his development while always retaining a distinctive, essential identity.<br>  <br>  ANSWER
e5c5e111d955b488ec97a787ff8bd616aa	First I gotta say I LOVE the warrior cats series :) Some of my other favorite series are Tithe and Valiant and ironside (all one short series) ummm...The House of Night series, and I'm going to start reading City of Bones the City of Ashes and I really think I'll like those|`|owDSIWYwaa	If you like the Warrior Cats series, you might like the book Tailchaser's Song by Tad Williams.  <br>  I have read several of the Warrior Cats books and enjoyed them all.  I have even given some of them away to older students.  I also liked the Dark Hills Divide series.
8jxoTBWIaa	Its a little depressing but very artistic =]<br>  <br>  I like it.|`|Bk4eIAWWaa	You seem to be very good when you are in total control of the light and subject. When taking a more photo journalistic style images you seem to lose your ability to compose properly. I can relate because I once had the same problem. I got over it by joining a photo club and getting involved in competitions.|`|stHol8ITaa	I know you're looking for criticism to improve your photography, but I can't find anything to criticise. I love your style, especially with those black and white photos. Some of the most enjoyable photos I've seen lately, kudos. Though perhaps the background of this photo should be sharper: <a href="http://sablexmelody.deviantart.com/art/Shoot-Me-101139322" rel="nofollow">http://sablexmelody.deviantart.com/art/S...</a>|`|Qnop8tkjaa	I love "The Future"!!!<br>  <br>  That is an amazing photograph!

The angle is unique, along with the gauze and all. If the picture is on the right, then it's pretty good. The black and white is really strong, along with how her eyelashes look. Although on the boring side, they are still pretty good :-)|`|03c870c2ab95c32e4284f873e1540058aa	most of its good but the first thing on the page , the girl with her eyes closed i really just dont like it that much (no offense if its you) just the texture on the face looks i guess gritty i dont know how to say it. the rest i do like quite a bit though|`|yY6qTloXaa	they are very intresting, and seem to have a little story behind them. nice work. :)
bNnlYyCdaa	I love it -- it has sentimental value for me, since I saw it the first time when I was 3, and it's the first musical I ever learned. I also think it's very clever, though. If you watch closely, each cat has a distinct personality, and it's fun to watch them interact, even the ones who aren't the main focus of a particular song. The dancers also have to show a tremendous amount of talent and training, which I always appreciate.|`|BZ5z5pXqaa	dont know now how it is...but my wife and i saw it back in the early 80's...FANTASTIC...and also great costumes
RfgtQHmhaa	Does it have to be wet or dry media? Or could it be photography?<br>  If you can do photography, what I would do is set up a fashion photo-shoot with some friends and take several pictures to represent both the positive and negative side of the industry.<br>  For the positive I would show a girl wearing a pretty dress, smiling and being happy (maybe even holding money if you want to show the economy aspect of it), and to show the negative side I would show a very thin girl in a position where she looks depressed and sick.|`|AA11263103	You must need help since you ask this about 12 times!!<br>   Just cut pictures and titles to show that This is why girls are being anorexia and bulimic.
eZ2oOkSZaa	wow its BEAUTIFUL
NHkNN5Pbaa	Something with an anti-shake or image stabilization system.<br>  Off the top of my head, any of the Canon Powershot series could work. Canon have a really good image stabilization system.<br>  <br>  A good one might be the Fujifilm Finepix s1000fd.. it's around 200 bucks or so and is 10MP with 12x optical zoom and shutter, aperture and stabilization modes.<br>  <br>  But if you're serious about sports photography you might want to consider buying an SLR instead, it really makes all the difference when it comes to movement and shutter controls.|`|79ieDdkhaa	just use a high shutter speed and a large aperture
AA11544289	the hoedown throwdown by miley cyrus?<br>  lol<br>  its pop it lock it polka dot it countrifey and hip hop it. and other stuff (:|`|8S2icURfaa	Are you in like 3rd grade or something? That is so old!|`|PCFSm1GLaa	It's a retarded dance for retarded people who live in like the country.

8S2icURfaa	You sound just like my friend Kristianna. She is an AMAZZING dancer, I'm so jealous. She's been dancing since she was 2. Her grades have been falling but she is really smart. I think she is just bored with the work we have to do. I admire her so much. Just keep working and pay attention!
ZsCAXId7aa	No, she was a singer and a comedian, a dancer.
8ygky5g4aa	During the 80's dance moves continued to change.  There are many dance moves that were huge in the 80's.  The worm, the moonwalk, the running man, the cabbage patch.  Early 80's (1980-1984) break dancing was HUGE!  Then in 1983 Michael Jackson redefined dance with his moonwalk, then early hip hop with the running man, cabbage patch and the Roger Rabbit!<br>  <br>  You may want to check out Michael Jackson, Madonna, Salt N Pepa videos and maybe the movie Breakin.<br>  <br>  These sites may help:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.80sgirl4ever.com/dance-fads.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.80sgirl4ever.com/dance-fads.h...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.heartlessdoll.com/2009/02/top_ten_most_memorable_80s_dance_moves.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.heartlessdoll.com/2009/02/top...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK1oLDFw2uU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eK1oLDFw2...</a>|`|vgibvETVaa	Look up vanilla ice, new kids on the block or MC hammer. Some of those music videos really show the type of dancing that was being done then.  you could also use one of the songs.
