I can go fast though if i lightly tap on the accelorator and slowly hit high rpms but it won't do it when i push too much down on the petal.

20090131164810AAEfVGh	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Ford	Does the Ford Escape Hybrid have a good reputation?	I wouldn't mind investing in a Ford Escape Hybrid as any kind of SUV big or small that can manage 32 MPG is amazing, but are they more difficult to keep up than a regular gas-only engine vehicle?       I mean, will I have to deal with nonsense such replacing parts or batteries to the electric half of the engine at say 100,000 miles or something? I have an old gas drinking Ford Ranger that has 230,000 miles on it with very little work so far so I don't want to worry about replacing ultra expensive parts on a new hybrid before that kind of mileage, you know?

Saying your parking in a parking spot and your just rolling in at like 0.1-1 mph and you feel your tires nudge the bumper. Whenever I park I always hit the parking bumper to make sure I'm always 100% in the parking space.

20090131151816AA20vuZ	Cars & Transportation;Car Makes;Dodge	Stalling problems with a 1996 Dodge Ram 1500 V6...?	In cold weather, my truck will start up just fine and run without stalling.  However, if I make only a short trip (i.e., 5 or so minutes in length) and then turn off the truck, I am not able to not start it again for a couple of hours.  The engine turns over just fine (i.e., the lights come on, the truck starts to idle, etc.) but unless I keep my foot constantly on the gas, it just keeps stalling and I can't get it going for two or more hours.  Does anyone have any idea what is causing this?  (Note: it runs fine in warmer weather - i.e., above 5 Celsius - and I can "stop and go" as many times as I'd like; it's just that once it hits below that temperature, I cannot turn off my truck unless I know that I won't be needing to use it again for a couple of hours)

Ever since its been hooked up my car will flash the batter light and then the CEL and shut off.  No sputtering nothing.  Just turn off.  and today when i was replacing the actual subs, i had the sub's amp turned off and had the speakers just playing my ipod and after an hour the car died.  The load from the system doesn't seem like it'd be too much for the battery but what else could be causing it.       My guesses are either alternator, battery, or a bad ground.  I'm goign to get the alternator checked out tomorrow, but is there anything i'm not thinking of?

20081115114438AAwvoWP	Cars & Transportation;Buying & Selling	Want to trade cars with my sister. Do we have to pay sales tax on my car twice?	My sister and I want to trade cars. My car still has a loan on it, which she will take over. When she goes to get the car registered in her name, I assume they will charge taxes for it. I already paid taxes on it last year, being as it is an expensive car the taxes will be high. She is going to 'gift' her old car to me so I don't have to pay taxes but it will count as a trade-in.      For my car I am giving her, is there a fair and legal way to avoid that double tax charge (the taxes I already paid and what she will have to pay)?  We were thinking maybe we could refinance the car as co-borrowers, then she could get registration and insurance on the car.      Just dosen't make sense to have to pay taxes when trading cars with family. WA state I don't think has a tax exemption for car sales to family like other states do.      Thoughts?

The next morning it won't start again, nothing would turn on and the engine didn't try to turn either.  Complete silence.  I asked a coworker to help jump it, initially the lights in the car turned on but the engine would do nothing.  After charging the battery with my friend's car for about 10 minutes I tried again and the engine made click-click-click sounds, but still would not start.  I finally gave up and went to work.  Later that night I asked another friend to help jump the car, except he's a dork and connected his end of the jumper cable backwards.  It was on there for a few minutes before I realized it.  Then he corrected it but my car still would not start.  We went and got a new battery, intalled it, but the car still would not start, no lights, no sounds, nothing.  I check all the fuses and they seem to be ok.  PLEASE PLEASE HELP!!
