20090309132301AA9pHgP	Computers & Internet;Computer Networking	Load Balancing Router and DSL Question for Streaming Video..?	Said name customer has debit system (POS) on a DSL line with a dynamic IP of course. He wants to remote his DVR to view his shady employees while home. 4 cameras at 380x420 res I estimate need at least 2mbs up to stream decently. He gets 1.5 down and 1 up on his DSL. If we add a second DSL line with a static IP for the DVR, could I then install a load balancing router to double his upload speed? So I'd have the first dynamic ip modem going to a switch, the POS/debit system plugged into that switch, that switch going to the load balancing router, and also the second DSL line going to that load balancing router. Will this all work and anyone recommend a good load balancing router if my theory is in fact correct? Thanks for any help as I'm not familiar with load balancing routers.

If I leave it idle(meaning not use it while its logged on) for a little while the screen goes black and won't work. I have to power off and when I turn it back on the screen stays completely black, just the power lights are on. It usually takes hours or days of resting until it works again and powers on normal. What is odd is when I plug the power cord in and open the laptop it will light up and start on its own the time it does decide to work. And I always use the cord because I know my battery doesn't last very long so its not a power issue. I hope someone can help solve this, thanks.

20090309142227AAvOnUB	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	What causes web pages not to load?	Hi Everyone,      I am working on a website and I am having problems with some of my pages loading. I thought it might have been an error in the html code. I rechecked & found no errors. I even moved the pages around. I moved the ones that were working, into the slot of the page that would not load. It loaded fine. When I click the page in the file. It displays properly at the top and everything. But when I try to access it from another page, it will not load. I get a white page that says this page can't be displayed. Here is the area I am having problems with.          Suicide Memorial Garden      Infant Memorial Garden      Military Memorial Garden      Public Service Memorial Garden      Pet's Memory Garden        The first and 4th pages are the only ones that work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated.

20090309155832AAZT9p1	Computers & Internet;Internet;MySpace	A former friend that I haven't spoken to in more than a year sent me a Myspace friend request. Should I accept?	This girl and I haven't seen/spoken to each other since about November 2007. We used to hang out together a lot, but by November 2007, our lives were busy and our schedules didn't coordinate anymore.      She was also on my Myspace friends list. Even though we hadn't seen/spoken to each other since November 2007, I had kept her on my Myspace. But I deleted her in April 2008, because I had sent her a Myspace e-mail a week prior but she didn't reply. She must've been mad at me, and that's probably why she never replied. I felt that she was just keeping me on her friends list as a trophy friend. So I deleted her.      Then yesterday morning, I logged into my Myspace and there was a friend request from her. She also sent me an e-mail with just the words "How are you?" and "I miss you a lot."      So, should I re-add her after all this time? It's been 11 months since I deleted her from my Myspace. I miss the good times we had as friends, but I don't really miss her. And why would she let so much time go by before attempting to contact me? I get the feeling that she's just lonely or probably got into a fight with her boyfriend. That's probably why she decided to contact me after all this time.

20090309162839AApI0hK	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Laptops & Notebooks	Laptop turns off everytime I plug it in, charger turns off too?	Okay, so I have a HP DV1000 laptop, and I'm having this weird problem. My laptop will be plugged in, and when I turn it on, the lights on the laptop turn on and off instantly. The charger on the light also turns off, at that point I have to unplug the charger and put it back in, then the charger LED will turn back on. So basically, the computer won't turn off, and the charger keeps on messing up. My connection is fine because I've tried two different chargers, so my idea is that the problem lies in the battery. Any ideas? Thanks.

20090309164120AAcXvhM	Computers & Internet;Software	How can I create a form or some type of email that is integrated with my Microsoft Outlook email account?	Hi, I want to create a form or a message that limits the amount of characters in an email to 160, basically a text message. I have an omnia that for some reason, when emailing from a gmail server does not send texts to my phone when the message is over 160 characters. Therefore, I need to limit the amount of characters to a certain limit so that I do not go over this limit and my texts send. I want to use Outlook to send this message so if you know of any programs that can integrate with outlook or if there is a function in Outlook itself to limit the characters to 160 or to truncate the message automatically before sending please let me know.

20090309100048AAkRqMV	Computers & Internet;Software	Need some help with MIDI! I have an Alesis Micron synth, M-Audio Uno, and Sony Acid Music Studio. How do I...?	I am an electronica and hip hop producer with a "quick" question about MIDI.   I know how to hook everything up to my computer (I use a Dell Inspiron 6000 laptop running with Windows XP), and if I play my synth like a regular keyboard (note by note) my software will record it perfectly....      But whenever I try to send a pre-recorded pattern to my computer from my Alesis Micron, it won't record it.   (If you have a Micron [or just about any other synth on the market for that matter], you should know about how you can hold down a single key that can play a pre-recorded pattern until you stop pressing it.)      My problem is, when I hook up my MIDI equipment and get everything set up right, my software won't record the patterns I have; but rather, it will record a single piano-sounding note.      Long story short: I want to know how to record patterns and pre-sets from my synth via MIDI.      Is there any way to fix my problem? Am I doing something wrong? Am I missing equipment?         Any help is greatly appreciated!

I'm not having a hard time getting the videos to MP4 format, but my main problem is size! I used VDownloader and Youtube Downloader to get some Youtube Videos, but the file size is enormous! It's like 25-30Mb! That's not very reasonable for a six or seven minute video (320x240 res).      I need to find a FREE video converter that can compress or atleast reduce the video size. I used /www.mediaconverter.org/ to convert a few similar videos...much better (5-7Mb, 320x240 res). but the problem is that this website has a limit per day. since they are having an issue, the limit was cut down to 5 convesrsions a day!      I want to find a user-friendly video converter/compressor that doesn't have a limit! (and keeps the video quality pretty good too...)

If it weren't for the fact that I had already bought all of the programs that I need in Windows version (Office Enterprise, SPSS, Adobe Master Collection--- over $1500 in software right there) for my work computer, I would have just gotten a Mac laptop, but sadly that was not a good option.  I always appreciate everyone's help!

20090309175314AAYXDvb	Computers & Internet;Internet;Other - Internet	Disney Movie Rewards Question (I'm not asking for points)?	I was built up to 5,000 points on Disney Movie Rewards. I let my daughter look through the catalog to pick something as we were going to redeem the points. Then the phone rang, I left the room for not even a minute, and she pressed the redeem button on a 1,000 point prize. I don't want it (It's the skinit thing for laptops) and I don't even have a laptop. So I went to the contact section, asking for my points back.       Has anyone been in this situation and if so, did you get your points back?       If you haven't been in this situation, do you think they will give them back?      Thanks!

I know that I'm supposed to go to Tools and Internet Options and then choose "show pictures" in the advanced tab. And then hit apply and okay. And refresh the screen. But when I close the browser and reopen it, the same problem happens again. How do I get it to stay that way when I open the browser? Please don't tell me to use Mozilla or a different browser. All of my bookmarks are saved in IE. Thanks.

20090309175214AA6JjV8	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	How do I change my Vista back to normal?	On my Vista Laptop, I started playing some older games like Half-Life 1 and some of its mods. Well, when I started playing them, at the bottom right corner of the screen (where the small display icons are at) it says "Windows Vista has turned to Vista Basic, It will turn back when the program is turned off". I was fine with that, then later after I turned the game off, It stayed the same as Vista Basic.      Vista Basic includes no see cool transparent windows and other effects.
