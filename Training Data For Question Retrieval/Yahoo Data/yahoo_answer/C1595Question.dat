We want to go on a family holiday somewhere not too far (max 2-3hrs from melbourne CBD) but its not really the place which is important, its the accommodation. We need a place that accommodates for at least 6 people, is quite private, has a swimming pool and just the basics. Not a resort or cottage, etc, it has to be a holiday house as my mum likes the privacy. Not exceeding 600 a night.   P.S Tennis court or gymnasium is a big +   Thanx in advance.

20090203121203AA8tnTz	Travel;Europe (Continental);Greece	Greeks, is the ελληνικ? διασπορ? the reason for your luck?	"Eureka?    I did some studies last night and I think I find it.      Could it be, that the reason for such excellent % of privately own Houses/Flats is due to the extremely large "diaspora" of Greeks living out of the country?      7.000.000 of them all over the world?   That is nearly as much as the number of Greeks living in Greece.   Well 70% to be exact.      The Greek diaspora - elliniki diaspora is a term used to refer to the communities of Greek people living outside of the traditional Greek homelands worldwide.    Members of the diaspora can be identified as those who themselves, or whose ancestors, migrated from the Greek homelands.      I did ask my Greek friends, and they all said that them or their parents did leave some kind of housing to their relatives back in Greece after their settlement in Australia.      It would explain the Italian housing dilemma due to large diaspora as well.   Indeed you lucky.      My question is?      Do you believe that I am right in reaching this conclusion or are there other more important factors involved.

20090219225126AAjhO7n	Travel;Africa & Middle East;Israel	Jews, How can a person no longer be a Jew?	I have asked about Jews that follow JESUS/YESHUA and every time the answer are the same "No Jew believes JESUS/YESHUA was/is the Messiah"    A person is a Jew if they are bloodline decedents of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and one on the 12 tribes.   Does their bloodline and family history change if they accept JESUS/YESHUA?   How can no longer be a Jew?   What about the parents, brothers and/or sisters? Are they still Jews even after history has changed and that person is no longer a decedent of one of the 12 tribes.   How can a person no longer be a Jew?   Can it be reversed? I would LOVE to get to move to Israel, and stay there.      No, I am not trying to be sarcastic. I am as serious as Moses was when he got the commandments. I want serious answers. I want to know how you can say a person who was born a Jew is not one after they accept JESUS/YESHUA!   I will ask 100 time if I have to. I WANT TO KNOW HOW?!?!?!?      I hope making the reference to Moses like that is not blasphemy. If so, I sincerely apologize. I am just trying to show how very serious I am with this question.
20090203121413AALDhMo	Travel;United States;Cincinnati	Moving to Cincinnati?	I graduated from Purdue University back in December and I just got a job offer in Cincinnati. I don't know a thing about the city, where to live, what things to do etc. It is an Inside Sales position and I will be making 36k as a base salary during the first year while I go through their Management Training Program. It is required I work 60-hour weeks for the first year and on Saturdays for 4 hours. After that year is up, I can make 100% commission on top of the 36k with the hours dimming down anywhere from 50 to 60 hours a week with the weekends off. I'm an African-American/Hispanic male, my fiancee is white, and we have a 20 month old daughter together. I've been told by a few people to watch out for the racism down there because apparently people aren't as accepting of it compared to other places. Based on the salary, the hours, how the economy is, and other circumstances. . . . .should I take the job?

Tuesday August 25th       After the great day yesterday I was thinking about having a barbeque with my family at a back yard of my house. I got everything ready for the great afternoon. I invited all my family friends and I had a great time till my Mother ask when will I get a wife? I was like a dead person I was just looking at my Mother with my eyes wide open. My Mother asked me if I was ok I didn’t say anything. Then she said she is a great person she is nice, rich, sweat and ECT…….    I couldn’t say anything but ok.

I did everything a normal Pharaoh does the rest of the day.
20090220001158AA7iBeM	Travel;Europe (Continental);Portugal	Why are there so many British people living in Portugal?	I know I can type, speak, and understand English. I was born in the United States but I went on a trip to Portugal to discover the cultures and traditions of the Portuguese. I was upset to find myself among a sea of British people some tourists but most were living in Portugal.    Honestly it is not a good thing. I would walk through villages and there were a handful of English pubs. Whenever I would listen to the radio, most of the time it was music sung in English. I don't think that many Portuguese people understand English but the radio folks put on the music because it's cool.  I don't think it is really cool for Portugal.  Alot of Portuguese people can't even say the word pancakes right.    I didn't go to Portugal for an English experience. If I wanted to go to a country where they speak English I would have stayed in the United States or I would have gone to the UK on vacation.  The Portuguese should stop this nonsense and stick to their real roots before it is too late. The British are being a very bad influence on the Portuguese and it should stop.    By the way the British aren't nice. The Americans and the Indians realized that many years ago.

20090220030058AAxh8ry	Travel;Asia Pacific;Philippines	I feel bad being a Filipino Muslim?	I mean, I seriously feel bad. and worst, when hearing news about terrorism. I go to a good catholic school, however, my whole family practices the religion. up to my relatives.       It's a shame for me to be one, especially, if there is no Muslim now to be trusted, at least I think so..       also, I am being made fun of because of terrorism and all the ugly things they know about Filipino muslims (selling dvd, quiapo's slum areas, bombings in Mindanao, total poverty of Fil Muslims especially in Mindanao, funny clothes as what they think).. my family lives in a good neighborhood though, where there are about two families of Muslims which we know of...       I used to practice the religion even though I grew up in a Catholic neighborhood and schools, however, my social life had been making me feel worse. People kept on asking me about why do terrorists do these and do that, which I seriously don't know of! and I feel paranoid whenever there is inequality in general, I feel like it's because I am a Muslim :[ - different from the people around here.       so what do you think of Filipino Muslims? in general, I know you'll say that we are "salot".. my professor slipped his tongue one time, forgetting that I was there, saying something like "if probably there are no Muslims, the world will be a better place"       now what's up with that? :[ am I just gonna live like this?
