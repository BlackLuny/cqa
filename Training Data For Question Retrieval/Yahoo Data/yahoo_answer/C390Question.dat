20090219170645AAD3oiU	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Does any one know where i can buy this specific type of lava lamp?	I have a green and clear lava lamp with a black base. I've had it for years and today i broke it. Not exactly the best way to figure out that it's wax on the iside... so anyway it's completely smashed... does anyone know where i can find a replacement water tube. I think it's 21 oz. and i need it to be a green and clear (everywhere i look it's green and blue and i have that.). SO could someone please tell me where i could find a green and clear lava lamp. I'm keeping the base so i just need the lava part. But if i have to buy a whole lamp thats fine.      I've been looking on google so please don't just post a website you googled or yahooed without searching through it. I'm looking for a link to an actual lamp or someone who has one for sale. Thanks

So my friend, Joaquin, was in the car with his cousins who decided be smart allecks and light a blunt in the car. Apparently it had this horrible smell and he told them to throw it out, cause they weren't gonna smoke it in his car. Well the smell got into his car and he hasn't been able to get it out.      I got a few rides in his car and now the smell has gotten into my clothes.  It's been 3 weeks since he's moved and the smell STILL hasn't come out of my clothes. It's been through 5 laundry loads, and one load with Oxy-clean. The smell is just as strong. Now the smell isn't enough to bug other people but I can smell it at least and it drives me crazy. I'm tired of smelling like weed. What can I do to get rid of the smell?

20090219173946AAXGg7Z	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Tiled floor next to tub squeaking?	Just had the 2nd floor bathroom redone.  We needed to get the 2nd floor bath done in part because the floor tile had failed.  It was installed on top of the sub floor, and the tile and grout became lose and started to come out.  Well, we just had the bathroom retiled, and also expanded by taking out a closet.  A new whirlpool tub was installed in the new expanded portion of the bathroom (which used to be a closet).      Now the tiled floor next to the tub is starting to squeak.  The contractor did not replace the sub floor in the bathroom.  He said he installed the tub so that it was resting on two joists and because it was secure on the joists he did not need replace the subfloor (even though it was very thin).  Under the tile, he had installed cement board.      Well, after he first installed the tile and tub there was no squeak, but now all of a sudden if you stand on the tile next to the tub it squeaks when you move.        Why would this happen?  Are the joists overloaded?  What dangers could result from this?      Is this going to get worse?      Could this caused by a slow leak (note I have seen no signs of water damage)?      Is this going to cause movement under the tile and make the tile and grout fail again?      How can this be fixed?  The contractor is not quite done with the job, what, if anything, should I have him do to address this?

20090203112322AAa4gPN	Home & Garden;Other - Home & Garden	Stay in convenient 1-bedroom or move to big but far away house?	I am a college student currently living in a 1-bedroom apartment only a block from campus for $500/mo. It's nice enough and the location is very convenient, but it can be a bit noisy and the apartment has a bad mold problem (the toxic black kind) in the bedroom and bathroom.      For these reasons, my boyfriend and I have been looking for a 2 bedroom house to share. However none of the ones next to campus seem to be vacant (or they're VERY expensive). We just went and looked at a house almost 2 miles away from the university and I absolutely loved it - it was big and had lots of light and was very close to restaurants, grocery stores, etc. Plus, I would be paying about $50 less in rent per month.      My question is: do you think I should pull the trigger on this house and just deal with the distance? Or should I stay and wait for the perfect place to come along, even if it means paying more now and inhaling toxic spores every day?

Hey,         My friend owns a plumbing plant and I found an unused piece of machinery metal that actually looks like a sculpture. I would like to preserve it and make it last. It definately has rust, but maybe only 1.5 centimeters at the most.            How can I preserve this? To be honest, the first avenue I would persue would be to sand it and wipe it down with WD-40. Please help, this means a lot. Thanks.

20090221004625AAlL4TF	Home & Garden;Maintenance & Repairs	Is it possible to install a shut off valve when the water supply is still switched on?	This is a general question, meaning, I would like to know if you can carry out plumbing work on pipes even when the water supply is on. The reason for asking is because I live in an apartment where shutting off the mains outside is impossible and the shutoff points inside the apartment are either DEAD old and cannot be shutoff (ceased up, etc) or there just aren't any shut off points (all one pipe). In this scenario how would a plumber be able to install a new shut off valve with the water supply still on?

20090221011010AAuFkcd	Home & Garden;Decorating & Remodeling	Do I need Building Permits for this Espresso Stand?	I'm going to be leasing this abandoned espresso stand which used to house a mobile trailer stand.  Currently, there's a roof, posts, electricity, and (ut oh) a 6ft deep water holding tank.  Please look at photos to see where this holding tank is.  I want to cover it, bury it, or do whatever it takes to get rid of it.  Also, there is no roof cover over this extension and so would need to put boards or something over it to keep water out of it.      From what I've been told, I don't need a building permit for structures under 120 sq ft.  I plan to use only bottled water for my espresso stand, and put old water into a bucket to discard in the septic out back about 200 ft away from my espresso stand.      My question is... Will I need to tear down the storage structure since it will be attached by the outside walls (with no roof)?  I'm on an extremely tight budget and can't afford to build an espresso stand if I have to buy building permits and have waterlines & septic installed.  I just would like to make something like a shed to do business in.      What are my options (please keep it cheap, since this must either be cheap or a no-go).

20090221013952AAOcGyq	Home & Garden;Garden & Landscape	Is this a good garden?	This is my first actual garden so I’m kind of excited about it, but I don’t want to make any critical mistakes.      1. I churned the dirt today and removed anything with roots.  I don’t have a tiller or hoe, so I simply used a trench pick and a shovel.  The “tilled” soil is about six inches deep and very loose.      2. I dumped a fair amount of compost* on top of the churned dirt and mixed it into the soil.      3. I plan to dump bags of actual fertilizer on top of it all.  I’m not sure yet if I should mix-in the fertilizer or leave it as a top layer.      *compost: I started the composting process about five months ago.  I used a 55-gallon barrel, and rolled it around about twice a week for mixing, along with watering it.  It consists of manure (from ponies), dirt, straw, leaves, and kitchen scraps.  I had about 200 pounds of it in the barrel.      I will grow tomatoes (10), strawberries(10), onions(60), potatoes(15), and peppers(?).      It has good access to sunlight.  I have researched the proper planting periods, spacing, and care instructions for each plant.  I realize that farming is an ancient science, and there are certain things that can’t be researched, but are instead only gained through experience.  That’s why I’m asking this question.
