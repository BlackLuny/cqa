Most of the other answers will cause alot of grief and arguing, and even to the point they will throw stuff into your room or some other devious plot.If you rented the place first and your name is on the lease..sim[ply give them a one month notice to move..this is by law on a month to month lease...if just thier name is on the lease..them give them A one month notice in writing that you are moving unless the problem is corrected...If both of your names are on the lease you are kind of stuck them, for if you move the renting agency can make you liable for the remainder of the lease if you just up and move, and then your roomate leaves not fullfilling the lease..If you are both on the lease you can go to the leassing agency and see if they will do a "write off" on your part of the lease making you no longer liable to fullfill it..Get this in writing..If there is no way to do this..You are going to have to simply sit down with yoru roomate, and make up some WRITTEN RULES to hang up in the Kitchen...If thier name is on the lease you can actually send them a registered letter(even though you both have the same address) with your intent to leave due to unsanitary reasons..take pictures of the dishes piled up first in case they try to take you to small claims court for violating the lease..with a copy of the registered letter, and pictures of the health issues(dirty dishes) there is what is called "unusual circumstances" in a court of law that makes it legal to leave violating your lease with them..Health issues such as this and/or violence within the household  are two of the most allowable reasons that a court will let you legally break a lease with a roomate without you being penalized..registered letter and pictures are your best defense if you two cannot come to an agreement in a court of law...Dirty dishes create vermin invasion and other health issues such as ecoli etc. ..A court of law will award you the case due to these factors more so than any other reason

That is dangerous and can damage your pipes or blow sewage out of evey drain in your house.    There must be a reason why you suspect frozen drain pipes. Try heating the area you think might be frozen. It would most likely be frozen in a bend, not a straight piece of pipe.     I'm betting you just have a clogged pipe. Find a clean out or another drain that is between the kitchen sink and the sewer and snake from there. If you already pulled the P-trap ( that's the proper name of the J shaped pipe), then the blockage is probably in the pipe that the kitchen sink pipe attaches to.

Anyway young tree need lot of care from the beginning recommend to buy Superthrive( in home depot ) 1/4 tease spoon in 5 gal. bucket and soaking the root for 15-30min to prevent the tree get stress from arrive after that use mix soil 50/50 and plant them in large container and dig a hole about a size and a half of the plant base using a spade or shovel. Loosen the roots gently then place inside the hole. Do not dig too deep so that the trunk will be exposed. Allow for about 3 inches of the soil base to rise above the soil. I would recommend use the osmocote 14-14-14 fertilize or bloom booster 15-30-15, water twice a week in the summer, water once a week in winter. Fertilize in March, June, September. Wait until in spring they will bloom :) good luck

Bulb filaments are so fine that they are moved by vibrations we don't even feel.  It's very common for a filament to break and then be welded back into a continuous wire when a small (or not so small) bump sends the broken ends swinging close enough to arc across the gap.

Another possibility could be moisture from the steam of the bathwater causing some problems.  If you have no mechanical or electrical skills I recommend having a professional check the connections.

Turn the breaker back on and check the voltage.  If you don't know anyone personally to look at it, hardware stores can usually recommend someone.

Spray foam is used around windows and doors, as well as filling holes in the exterior wall.  Blankets, or batts, are used inside walls, or in attics instead of loose fill.

0ibf6g7Daa	Im assuming you have a snapping turtle or a Cooter or slider of some sort.  These water turtle are more difficult shells to preserve than box turtle shells.  This is because after the animal dies the shells begin to unfuse.  Box turtle shells stay fused after death.  The scutes on the shell will begin to fall off first and then the shell will break apart.  That being said, salting it will help if is still has a stench to it.  If it no longer smells I would get some low gloss polyurethane and using a foam brush apply 2-3 coats of it to the entire shell.  Blow on any bubbles that form on the shell while applying the polyurethane.  If the scutes have lifted or fallen off, super glue works the best to reattach.  Rinse it under warm water first and scrub off any dirt, first though.  After all this then sit it on the dresser as a decoration.|`|nGafpEwoaa	Hot water is a sanitizer.|`|3sU90myfaa	Pour regular salt inside the shell and let it set outside somewhere untill there is no odor left..rinse it at least 3 or 4 times after the rest of the matter has gone..then let completely dry..if the salt causes the outisde of the shell to go blotchy and spotty fear not...You can apply a simple coat of varnish or polyurethane on it after it is rinsed and dried well..and it will bring back and enhance the true color of the outside shell

9d8438febeda9f081685c3c773c13d90aa	A regular top loading washer uses 42 gallons of water on average, largest load, wash and rinse and spins out at about 600 rpm's (rotations per minute)..  A front loading washer uses about 16 gallons largest load and spins out at about 1000 rpms..  When you just 1/3 the water, you also use 1/3 the detergent etc...Xtra savings...  When you spin out at 1000 rpm's, you're cutting your drying time almost in half...When you're drying, you're pulling down 30 amps !    Let's say you pay $800 for a conventional top load set or $1400 on a basic but quality front load set...At that price, if you wash say 6-7 loads a week, the front load set will actually pay for itself in water, energy, and detergent etc. savings in 3-4 years...seriously.    And if you don't care whether they actually match, you can buy a $400 conventional dryer and still save on your dry time because of the front load washer...Just make sure you buy one with a moisture sensor...It will actually shut off WHEN your clothes are dry and not waste any electricity..    Remember, it's not just about saving water...It's about using less detergent etc. therefor costing yoy less and putting way less crap in our waterways...But also about saving drying time...Remember, 30 amps !!      Added.  I forgot to mention..You can also buy a non agitator set like you mentioned...It uses about 22 gallons largest load and it's the biggest you can get short of spendin $3000 on an electrolux front load set...  The dryer is built a little differently than a regular dryer...In most dryers, the motor that turns the drum and the blower motor are the same motor...In the Kenmore Oasis dryer, they seperated the two and made a seperate motor for the drum rotation and the fan motor and made the fan motor 35% stronger...Think about that..The Oasis spins out at 1100 rpm's getting twice the moisture out of your clothes...Dry time cut in half...The dryer dries 35% faster, cutting your dry time by another 1/3...The dryer actuall dries faster than the washer can wash !  Remember...30  amps !  The set will cost you about $1500 if you buy it before Sunday..

KZCUs612aa	Your information is sketchy and limited, but I'll try to answer your question based on my experience. The flooding is from groundwater or broken plumbing. either way the floor will need to be replaced, so you don't need to wait for the wood to dry out. So, when ever you can get past the mud or don't mind working in the mud, you can start demolition of the sub floor. After it is opened up then you can use fans and dehumidifiers for may be a week or less. As long as you are still removing water from the air through the dehumidifiers your not ready to start going back with the new flooring. At that point you can determine the extent of the damage to the floor joists,under the sub flooring you already removed. You may have to re-support them, sister them or re-place them too. A big project,time consuming and expensive. You must really love this building. Of course you do or you wouldn't be looking for answers.|`|BUPiXrxVaa	If the floor is solid wood, not laminate, there should be no reason to replace it unless it warps as it dries. It will need sanded and re finished though.|`|KwK6Mn5Jaa	i would use a circular saw, set to depth of floor to be replaced, not so deep as to cut into sub floor. make a cut in the center of the area to be replaced, the cut should run parallel to the floor boards. now carefully pry up boards to replace, make sure not to damage area not to be replaced. assess damage and moisture and let dry. could be hard to match existing floor. it is a tedious job and even skilled floor technicians will say this is a difficult task with a mediocre end result at best.

However, not only are they annoying you, you seem really angry about it.  (Hey, I have been around those blabber mouthed pests in the office, and I empathize with you.)    Have you ever heard the expression "He who angers you, controls you"?  Sad but true.  And the more we use sarcasm, name calling, swear words toward them, the worse they get, yet we are still controlled by their imbecility.  Quitting your job over their actions simply reinforces their control.  Your boss may be more criticle of your angry attitude than the antics of the slackers.      How to get rid of these people takes a mental and emotional overhaul on your part.  In your mind/heart you have to turn this around.  I know that clenching your teeth will be necessary at first.  This is hard to explain, so I'll use a personal example.  I couldn't get much work done because people always seemed to be standing in my doorway or cubicle yakking at me about their lives, and I really didn't care all that much.  My boss enrolled me in a Time Management class.  I thought I was going to learn techniques for plowing thru paperwork.  Hah!!!  The teacher had us visualize the instances of people wasting our time, then had us envision who the real culprit was.  Yikes!  It was me. Over the years I have practiced getting rid of them either by ignoring them, or saying "I really gotta get this done, I'll catch you in the coffee room", or "please go away".  Your delivery has to be nice.    If you have a revengful personality, draw a circle and color in the top half with yellow and the bottom half black.  Entitle it "Help is the Sunny Side of Control". Don't let anyone see this.  While you are practicing getting rid of them in a congenial manner, you can also volunteer to help them with their work.  You will have to be innocently sneaky to get the boss to notice.        Hope this makes some sense to you.  Good Luck.|`|48AZf586aa	Some thoughts:    ?

oIRLs6Spaa	There are really only 4 things Venus Fly Traps require to stay healthy:  1) Sunlight - at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day  2) Water - rain, distilled or reverse osmosis water only  3) Soil - Nutrient poor soil such as peat moss  4) Dormancy - Venus Fly Traps require a 3-4 month dormancy period during the winter    Venus fly traps like lots of light. Try to give it at least 4 hours of direct sunlight a day. The more you can give it the better. It is best to grow your fly trap outside where it can get plenty of sun and catch its own food. You don't actually have to feed a Venus Fly Trap anything other than sunlight and water. If you do choose to feed it, don't over do it. Feed it only insects and at most only a couple a month.    Venus fly traps need clean water. Usually tap water will not do. It is best to use distilled water, rain water, or reverse osmosis water. Venus fly traps need water with a TDS (total dissolved solids) measurement of 50 ppm (parts per million) or less. In order to get this, you probably need to use distilled water or reverse osmosis water or rain water. Their soil should be kept wet at all times except during the winter when it should be just moist. It is best to use a tray and set the plant in an inch or two of water.    If you need to repot, for soil you can use a combination of peat moss and perlite. Most growers use a 50:50 mix of peat moss and perlite. I have been leaning toward using pure peat moss lately. Venus Fly Traps aren't picky, but be sure to use some form of peat moss or sphagnum peat moss with perlite or vermiculite to ensure that the media is nutrient poor.    Without a winter dormancy period, your plant's health will start to decline and it will eventually die. You can read more about dormancy here:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/venus-fly-tra...    If you have any more questions, you can join the forum on my site and ask them there:  http://www.flytrapcare.com/phpBB3/|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	The Venus Flytrap is found in nitrogen-poor environments, such as bogs and wet savannahs. It survives in wet sandy and peaty soils.   It can be grown outside on a deck, window sill, or in the garden that receives two to four hours of sunlight. In areas of lower humidity, the plant can survive with frequent watering and a drainage system to prevent fungal growth. It is also beneficial to keep it in a tray with about an inch of water to maintain higher humidity levels. Stagnant water is dangerous for the plant, so using pebbles to elevate the plant from the water is safer for the plant. Venus flytraps grow better still in a greenhouse which often leads to healthy, vigorous and colorful plants. The color of the trap leaves may be used as an indicator of sufficient light; in appropriate conditions the inside of each trap should be bright red in color for most varieties. Insufficient light leads to the inside of the trap turning light green, although studies have shown other factors can contribute to the lack of red pigmentation. Low light also causes etiolation and makes plants more susceptible to diseases.    Venus flytraps are best grown in mixtures of sphagnum peat moss and/or peat often with the addition of sand, perlite or other inert salt free material. Soil pH should be in the range of 3.9 to 4.8.       The 'Dentate' cultivator of the venus fly trap in cultivationVenus Flytraps ideally should not be watered with tap water as accumulated salts in tap water may kill carnivorous plants. While soft water with TDS of 100 ppm or less yields good growth, both distilled, reverse osmosis water or clean rain water are ideal. The soil should be kept constantly moist by placing the pot in a tray full of water, with the root bulb of the plant allowed to be above the level of the water at least part of the time to prevent root rot in stagnant water. There is no danger of over-watering as Venus flytraps can survive short periods of immersion underwater.    Some horticulturists have experimented with giving small amounts of fertiliser to Venus flytraps, usually applying diluted solutions of products formulated for epiphytes, using cotton swabs, to the plant's foliage. Another method of fertilizer application is a spray bottle or pump. Beginners, however, and those without expendable plants, would be wise to avoid fertilizer in favor of insects.|`|WcudvcLxaa	you have to feed it   catch fly and put it on the mouths  and please tell me you didnt plant it on your garden  the soil specifications are so special u need to leave it on the pot  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_fly_t...|`|0bnXC9qkaa	The venus flytrap is a bog plant so put it in a pot slightly shaded bright sunlight medium peatish and stand pot in a dish of water so that the plant gets its feet wet.Change standing water every two to three days.|`|5C3zkmDOaa	I am not sure what you mean by "the little traps arent staning on their own".   You should not try to forcefeed the traps, though.  Don't push them shut or try to move them.  If something is stuck so that the trap won't fully shut, the trap will digest itself by spilling digestive acids outside of the plant.  Do not ever add fertilizer, either.  If you added fertilizer, that could be why the plant is perishing.  If that is the case, flush it several times with distilled water.  What I mean by that is to water the plant and let the water drain out of the plant and into the sink.  Let it drain a bit and them repeat the process.  You can do that a few times to be sure the peat is free of fertilizer traces.   It won't hurt the plant to over water it, and that will flush the ferilizer out of the soil.

In a garden, or elsewhere in your yard, you can sprinkle them (or cover their hill) with a hell of a lot of cayenne pepper, and they will expire shortly right before your eyes. This has worked on our black ants and sugar ants, but do not believe we have carpenter ants around these parts.    You can usually find very large containers of cayenne pepper at a dollar store, and I always buy several when they are in stock. I also have children and animals, so I am totally against using poisons, other than taking out wasp nests, as nothing else works.    Hope this helps, and good luck ;)|`|zDwPY4T1aa	I found this page:  http://thebestlistonline.com/the-best-wa...  It has good suggestions for getting rid of ants in and outdoors.
L8zmQS8Jaa	If it is tile you can take the tile up with heat, as in from a hair dryer or heat gun.  If it is recent tile you should be able to replace it.      If it is a floating floor there are also ways to cut out an individual piece and replace it.      If it is a wood floor the solution is to sand and refinish it.      How did it happen?  What room is this/Where is this?  What color is it?  Was it the dye in the blanket or something on the blanket?  All these things would help for a more definite answer.

5C3zkmDOaa	I am a home school teacher for a family of seven.  I guess you could say that I work beyond-full time as well.  I have gleaned ideas from different people and different sites through the years. My two most favorite sites for tips on managing family and chores are www.titus2.com and www.flylady.com  Have you been to either of those sites?  Oh, I also have found some good tips at www.nogreaterjoy.com  Maybe some information from one of those families will help you.  As for me, I have a schedule for the laundry.  Two to three loads of laundry get done each day; nothing is done on Sunday unless an emergency like a soiled bed changes my plans.  I have a master schedule in the laundry room.  For example, Thursday morning is set aside for twin bedding.  Everyone brings their bedding to me or it doesn't get done.  I train our children to do their own wash, too.  Every child ten years of age or older is expected to do his own laundry on the scheduled day and at the scheduled time.  If the child just doesn't do it, he has to wait until the next week.  That helps keep the kids serious about doing their chores at the right time.  That also keeps the work deligated.  Even my husband does his own laundry and ironing.  The rule is: If you want to wear it, you need to wash it.  I do their bedding, the towels, my own laundry and the laundry of every child under ten years old.  I also take extra time out of my schedule to make sure that I am training my children to do the chores properly.  It takes more time to help children participate in the clean-up of a home, but the time taken to teach them pays off in the long run.  I actually spend very little time in the kitchen or dining room after each meal.  The time I spend is in cooking the meals.  Now that my oldest is 16 and my youngest is 5, the children are all able to get just about every clean-up task done, including cleaning off the chairs after each meal, without me.  Even if your children are young, I would start now teaching them and delegating whatever is age-appropriate.  The bottom line, though, is that the kids grow up so fast.  If you are spending all your extra time cleaning up their messes without them, you will be spending less and less time with them as they grow up and away from you.  Get them and your husband involved and train your whole family how to pitch in.  Hey, even a two-year-old child can put his dirty dishes into the sink and "wipe" his table area with a wet cloth.  It won't seem like heaps of help at the moment, but it will set the stage for him to become better at work.  It will also give you both a little sweet time together.  If you have the right attitude, including the kids can even make the jobs less monotonous!  Hugs and much understanding,  Sharon :)|`|Xmy5PLysaa	Well If You Can Afford It Have A Laundry Service Pick It Up .

I make sure that my kitchen is clean everynight before I go to bed otherwise I do it first thing in the morning. We're a family of 4 (two young children; 8 & 11) so things can get dirty quickly if you don't watch out. As for laundry, we probably do 2-3 loads every couple of days. We don't stay on that as much. We kind of wait until we have nothing to wear and then it clicks, haha. Don't let housework stress you out, though, it's a common everyday thing that we all have to do.|`|jaHkY4Rbaa	You sound overworked and overwhelmed?    Are you ?|`|FVMcBP2Qaa	I work full time in a residential treatment center, and I do 5-6 loads of laundry every night and prepare breakfast for 13 residents in the morning (thankfully, they are responsible for the dishes).  My wife and I are both full-time students, and she also works part time, leaving a small portion of the housework to me.      In my experience, the sense of being overwhelmed is completely legitimate, even more so for somebody who does not have a clear distinction between work and home.  To combat this, I would suggest setting clear 'boundaries', so to speak, between the time you spend 'working' and the time you spend taking care of your house.      You have quite a bit on your plate, taking care of the needs of five people plus working full time.  If you are able to put the 'work' aside for a portion of your day and focus on the house, then you may feel more productive with things at home and a little less overwhelmed at the end of the day.

If not, you trap the dirt in. As mentioned there are many cleaners available retail for that purpose. That being said, not all of them do what they claim. Actually, a good degreaser, even dish washing liquid and water can work wonders on granite. Just be absolutely certain that whatever product you use does NOT contain any sort of acid........ even citrus acid. Use a terry cloth rag to scrub and not anything that is abrasive. Also, if there is something that the degreaser won't quite bring up, use rubber gloves and try a solvent like Acetone. Try all of this in a small out of the way area first just to make sure of the results. It is possible that the granite has been treated with something else over the years.<br>  <br>  Once you have it cleaned, I would suggest you apply a solvent based impregnator (instead of a water based sealer) to further protect the surface (Home Depot or a janitorial supply house). The topical sealers (and waxes) tend to build up over time, dulling the surface. Impregnators on the other hand, penetrate into the pores and protect without a buildup. Not a bad idea to reapply every 6 months to a year.<br>  <br>  Granite is very much harder than marble. The way the factory finish is achieved is using high heat and pressure. In the field, when someone comes to your home to re-shine the granite, they can only simulate the factory shine. Maybe getting within 95% of that shine. They will be using certain acids, tin oxide in conjunction with natural fiber (hog's hair) pads, generating their own heat from the chemicals. Another trick is to spray WD - 40 onto a soft cloth and wipe the top evenly. It has a tendency to saturate the top making it look deeper and richer. Again, try on a smalll, inconspicuous spot. have fun!|`|deb5caa9fa6557fd352e09c062acb672aa	I actually know a guy who makes his living polishing granite.

If it isn't important to have things far apart, have them touching. Example: Bed touching side of desk. Now you're minimizing wasted space.    Have things compacted on shelves and organized. Keep things in storage when not in use.. Like me, I haven't played my guitars in months, so instead of having them out on display, I put them in their cases, folded up the stand and put it all under my bed.|`|nyrXBf6kaa	Well, I suppose it depends on which rooms we're talking about.    Bedroom - if it's at all possible try to get a smaller bed, or a bed that folds up into a closet OR folds into a couch or smaller item. Maybe even an air mattress would work, deflating it only when you're not sleeping (but that might be a pain to do it every day, & I hate it when they leak sometimes in the night).   Stacking items on top of each other might also help, like using your dresser as a TV stand (if your tv is in your bedroom).   Also try buying organizers that easily stack on top of each other with sliding drawers & put those in one corner of your closet, that way you can keep all your books/paperwork/extra clothes, etc. out of the way. (something sort of like this... there are plastic ones that can stack without the frame so you can make it as big or as little as you like: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... )    Bathroom - I'm not sure what they're called, but there is an item that is 'U' shaped, but upside down, & the arch hangs over your toilet, & it has many shelves to hold all of your toiletries. Depending on what kind you buy, you can also hang your towels off of the sides. (here's a picture: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... )    Kitchen - to make more space in your drawers for items that cannot hang, I would suggest hanging items like potholders, dishcloths etc. from the walls, & buying something that you can hang from your ceiling that has hooks on them, it will hold all your pots & pans that have holes in the handles (just make sure the pots & pans are done drying before hanging them up, hehe).    Once again, I'm not sure what this item is called, but it is basically a counter top that has wheels on the bottom to roll it around, & they also usually come with extra drawers or cabinets to hold any extra kitchen items you may need to store. The best part is that when you're not using it you just roll it away. (that looks like this: http://www.walmart.com/catalog/product.d... ).  There is another item you can purchase that hangs off of a door that can hold things like cans, chips, trash bags, etc. Basically like having extra shelf space in your kitchen (I have one hanging off of my bedroom door, but when I open the door it faces the kitchen like it's a part of it... it looks something like this http://www.shopgetorganized.com/prodetai... ).       That's about all I can think off, sorry for the long answer! =) Good luck, & have fun!

5586ad15a09ab2f36457c1e8042071f2aa	A water hammer happens when water is running and you slam the valve shut. The moving mass of water slams into a dead end, causing the BANG noise you hear. It does NOT happen when you open a valve, but only when you rapidly SHUT a valve. Therefore, since you say it happens when the dishwasher "kicks the water on", it likely is not the dishwasher you are hearing but something else connected to the water line. A water hammer is prevented by putting a "bubble trap" near each valve. A bubble trap is simply a T with a foot long section of closed end vertical pipe. It is the job of this pipe to catch air bubbles. When you close a valve, the moving water compresses the air very much like a spring and prevents a bang from happening. The usual location is at one or more high points in the system. You only need ONE on the cold line and ONE on the hot line, but more is better and I have never seen fewer than 3. The people who told you to drain and refill the system have the right idea as that will let air into the system to make sure the bubble traps have air in them. Some water systems work so well that the air bubbles get absorbed and there is not enough air in the regular supply to refill the traps and water hammers start happening because the bubbles completely go away or are too small to work effectively. In my house, I have an actual surge tank. A surge tank is like a balloon inside the pipe so the bubble effectively never goes away. The air bladder has a pressure gauge to show the pressure in the bladder and there is a minimum required for it to work. You check the pressure by shutting an isolation valve and then venting the water side and looking at the pressure. A simple bicycle pump is all that is necessary to pump up the bladder pressure if needed. If you feel that you should drain and refill, then isoate the house out at the street, open the valve at the highest point in the house, then open the valve at the lowest point and most of the system will drain. Let it fain until the water stops. Shut the two high and low point valves and then open the isolation valve out at the street and that should be all you need to refill the bubble traps. Your faucets will sputter for a while because of excess air, so crack them open a little to prevent splashing water out of the sinks when bubbles escape. It will not hurt anything to drain and refill, but from your description, I think it is likely it will not solve the problem. Look for something else which might make a banging noise...|`|LqaQ5f5Vaa	water hammer is caused by two things, loose pipes, water pressure to high, if its only on your dishwasher i would close the main valve a bit, should cure the problem,|`|BUPiXrxVaa	Here's a website, that explains water hammer and what to do to fix it.    http://www.plumbingsupply.com/waterhamme...|`|iAFQPknoaa	The electric solenoid valve in the dishwasher will close pretty quick.  It most likely gets it's hot water from under the kitchen sink, and you could install a water hammer arrestor in that area.    Running all the water out of the system would empty the air chambers, if present.  They would just fill up again in a few weeks.    Note: air chambers are a dead-end extension of the pipe feeding the fixture, usually 12" long on a 1/2" line.  They're suppose to hold air to act as a cushion.  They are not required in all jurisdictions, so you may or may not have them.  Their efficiency is questionable.    Another note: you can check the incoming water pressure with a gauge that screws onto any hose bib, costs around $10.  If the pressure is much over 80 psi, you should consider installing a pressure reducing valve on the incoming water (and a thermal expansion tank at the water heater).    And yet another note:  if you already happen to have a pressure reducing valve installed, you should get the gauge anyway, and make sure that it's holding steady.  PRVs will fail from time to time.

Also go to home depot and find out when they do thier inventory after inventory they will way discount items that have been or will be discontinued and they only have a few of them, for example I got a huge granit sink for $50.00 it is beautiful, at the time I didn't plan on buying a stove and so I passed up a great deal on a 6 burner double oven stove it was less then the cheaper modle I later bought. We did vynel tile for the floors, they are cheap and they look really nice. We had a lot of complications we ran into also, one of which was this hidious vynel stuff on one of the walls and either we had to replace the drywall or cover it so we covered it with bead board. we also had to replace alot of drywall in the kitchen due to damage. so if you don't run into those problems that will save you money also.

AA12180549	We have had a similar problem like that.   That loud noise is called water hammer.  I would say that you have a plugged off vent.  There is something not allowing the air to escape and water to expand and pass freely.  The upstairs toilet is working really hard to force past the air in the system so that's why it's flushing like that. Check the vents to your system and clean them out.    If that doesn't help, I would have a plumber come check it out because there is the possibility something going on with the sump pump too.|`|421b5d50a68e6207de47af48e556863eaa	vent vent vent --- either you dont have a properly vented system or there is a plug in a vent -- you can install a one way check valve vent or run one threw your roof|`|BUPiXrxVaa	To make the banging stop, secure the drian pipe better near the pump. When the pump goes off it's kind of jerking the pipe causing the banging noise. To make the toilet flush right, tighten the chain a link or two that goes from the handle to the flapper valve. If that doesn't work, replace the flapper.|`|fQgG62SRaa	When your sump starts, it creates a vacuum through the system, as it's supposed to. Being that you recently had the drains cleaned, there is no restrictions interferring with its operation and the pipes are now expanding and contracting until the vacuums pull becomes equallized. As for the toilet, this is an adjustment made in the toilet of how much water is dumped from the tank to the bowl. With some, it's a simple adjustment and with others (like mine) you'll never get it adjusted properly again; you'll either need to hold the lever or plan on buying a new toilet.
1hciyvKdaa	Natural gas right? The temperature of your water heater if it is not set exactly the same as the neighbor, its set at a higher temp can certainly cause a huge change in the bills.  They may always wash dishes in warm instead of boiling hot water that you might.  They may shower at a lower temp and less times than you do  Got a gas stove? Do you bake more than them, cook more than them? Maybe they use a microwave or eat alot of cold foods?  I did this program for a free monts utility bill, we had to take a class, these were all things they brought up.  There is this stuff called weather stripping if your home heating is gas, it screws in this strip that outlines windows and doors. You blanket over windows during the winter, the ones that wont show to keep the house warmer. You also use door sealers, like long socks filled with material or beans, that you push up against each interior door to keep warmth from leaving  a room. Does your hot water heater have an insulative blanket around it? That keeps heat from leaking out so the the thermostate will not run more than it needs to.  Wash dishes by hand, in warm water if your able too. Dont turn on the sink and hot wash one spoon, rinse in cold water and set in the sink or dishwasher wait until you have lots of dishes to do and to them all at once.       Lots of small things can alter the cost of a bill. I had a phone with a purple bulb like one of those bright beer signs, the electric company here will actualy tell you the months cost of anything, so I called them up, that one light bulb was running like 8 or 9 dollars a month, for one light bulb!|`|8740c9d03300d2d76f91ceaf7a9ffc93aa	Report it!|`|HP1pToMOaa	Prepayment meters are notorious for high charges.

Its for tenants who feel as though they are being wrongly or unfairly treated by their landlords.    If they are not accredited (official) then its illigal and you can report them still!    Google landlord accreditation team and give them a ring, as a paying tenant, you shouldnt have to put up with that.    I would also refer back to your lease and see what it states about them coming to fix that sort of stuff, it seems that they are lazy and im not sure that they are proper landlords at all.      ....haha yes i know you are a legal tenant, however i am not convinced they are legal landlords!  But you still have your rights so i wouldn't worry.  It is them who is getting reported, not you!
5C3zkmDOaa	What you might consider doing is making a dugout for the television-viewing section.  I was actually in a home where the room had no flat floor.  Carpeted sections like bleachers with wider-than-normal steps served as permanent furniture in the room.  It was filled with lots of pillows and was actually quite comfy and accommodating.  Such an area could contain the TV crowd in a comfy way and could actually take up less space while allowing room for a potentially large crowd, if designed well.  Lazy boy chairs will take up far more space with fewer seats for guests.  It really depends on how many people you plan to host in this room and how badly your back screams if you sprawl out on huge pillows on the floor. Still,  20x20 may be a bit tight with recliners and enough room for people to move around a full-sized pool table.

yu9PHV4Maa	carpenter ants aren't attracted to the common ant baits..there are a couple of professional products that are designed for carpenter ants and you can find them at a do it your self type pest control store or over the web.  The one that you want would be Maxforce carpenter ant gel.  As a pro I would have products that would be an aerosol but has a straw tip (like a can of WD40) to be able to spray into small openings where the ants are coming from, maybe you could find something similar...actually using a non insecticide like WD40 may be enough of an irritant to get them out.  If you get the center of the nest disturbed many winged ants will be coming out...even if a pro did it with the best insecticides for a couple of weeks you would still see ants emerging, not so much as their eggs are hatching but one of their stages of development they are in a cocoon, protected from any insecticide.--- side note- as they in general emerge from the cocoon and it is discarded from the colony and piles up in one area it looks just like saw dust so people panic buy a pest service and many services feed on this fear.  A $75-$100  pest service will get rid of carpenter ants just as well as a $300 service , maybe better , the cheaper one won't be drilling holes all over the place for show...|`|733a18bc9b818b5f9d75e4032cd40880aa	Some ideas:  Get a ant bomb fog spray and cover your table with newspaper close windows and doors and follow the directions on the can.  get the ant poison tube and squeeze it in all the seams or any opening you find.

I had this happen once before and the ants kept coming for weeks and weeks and I tried everything that you did. I honestly don't know how they stayed alive inside the wood with no apparent food source but they did because they just didn't go away, and it's not worth the hassle usually to keep killing them and have them all over your things.    If you are adament about keeping this table all you can really do is try and keep up with the poison and vacuum.  I do believe though that there is a better trap that they crawl in and cant get out, that way you don't have them constantly running all over the place.    Here is also a link to an eHow article that is about fire ants but it might help you o get ideas about when you can do.    http://www.ehow.com/how_4725012_achieve-...

If you kill the ants with the powder or poisens you are stuck with that on your table and do you really want to from a table that's poisened?|`|da580af9e5114d80d24d6e1ac5858417aa	I've dealt with ant issues in gardens, but never wood.

AKv1gj0Xaa	Yes, fleas can drown like any other insect. We used to flush them down the commode when I was a kid. But it's a rather ineffective way of getting rid of a flea infestation.    If they are seriously bad, best luck I've had is using any of the fogger products (Raid, Ortho, etc.). They usually come in three-packs, which will take care of most average-size homes. Set them up and take a few hours to go shopping. Come back, air the house out, then repeat the process in about a week. This ensures that you kill off the eggs that may not have hatched yet. In the interim, vacuum all the places where pets might travel or sleep, or anywhere you have noticed more flea problems. Wash clothing and bedding as normal.    Fleas tend to be at their worst in the early spring and the fall. If you have outdoor pets, give them flea collars and spot treatments that can be purchased from the store and will prevent fleas from setting up a circus in your home.|`|qChv1Bymaa	Noo, i tried that when i was combing the fleas off my dog, i thought it would help to put all the fleas in a bucket full of water.

Sprinkle a little 7dust on the carpet.   You might want to think about wormer for your dog as well. If a dog, or human, swallows a flea they can get tapeworms

It's reasonable to expect a sofa to last more than 8 months.  I think you normally have to give them an opportunity to repair it but in this case that's unreasonable.  Stick to your guns, say that you have been sold something which is not suitable for purpose, tell them you know your rights (whether you do or not) and stick to your guns.  If you don't get any joy then on Sunday morning arrive outside the store really early with photos of your sofa and some signs and stay there until you get your money back.

In a dark, airtight container is best!|`|AA10283947	May I suggest you use the first lot now, before beginning, place a small amount aside for mixing with the next succession.  Spreading the first bin over the garden, turn the next lot over into the bin of the first lot, this will encourage aerobic breakdown, cover with old carpet or such and leave for several weeks the bacteria can now flourish with refreshed air and the process is sped up, empty the final bin into the empty second bin adding some of the original compost, again cover and leave to rot.  Now begin to fill up the third bin with this years contributions, it always helps if you fork in a bit of the first stuff you've set aside amongst any of the bins that are disturbed, this gives them a greater start with bacterial breakdown.  Do all of this on a quiet day preferably in the sunshine to gain heat or reduce heat losses.  Add any snails or worms found on your garden and they will stay put and feed until they die leaving the next generation to carry on breaking down the upper layers , they will in turn die as the bin gains heat and the contribution changes into compost, enclosed bins are better for this purpose     There are now some bins on sale which can work in a similar manner as cement mixers these can tumble the contribution several times over several weeks until the airborne bacteria has done its job, this is the way that local authorities make and sell compost except they operate on a commercial scale..|`|4eJGbvzWaa	you might be better off storing the finished compost in plastic bags until it is ready to be used. the finished product will take up less space. that way you can turn over the other two piles. this will leave you with an empty bin, for your newest scraps, which can now get started decomposing.

3sU90myfaa	No you cannot..some seeds need total darkness to germinate when others need the exact opposite..This applies to flowers and veggies/herbs..each seed has thier own requirements..Some need warmth and some need cold to germinate..I grow a garden 12 months out of the year and start most of my seeds indoors under lights(excepting the ones needing darkness)..I do hard cuttings, soft cuttings, and propagate plants in this manner as well...Here is opictures of my garden album..this is my experience..I was born with my fingers in the soil being raised on a farm|`|f57f19afc977beb390488d1a707b7b00aa	no you can't. cress and mustard have thin seed coat that breaks when water is absorbed by the seed. some seeds have hard seed coat which is very impossible for you to germinated just by putting it on a wet towel. such seeds are taken from stone fruit (such as the peach), where a hardened fruit layer ( the endocarp) surrounds the actual seed and is fused to it.|`|AA11498082	Any seeds I have tried to germinate using wet paper towel and plastic bag have sprouted.

3sU90myfaa	The most common reason for this is if you have pets such as cats and dogs..thier hair gets in the bag or canister and sets and molds and rots thus giving it a bad smell as it rots..as well we don't always bath our pets as often as we should and they have a natural odor/scent same as humans do..this hair sets in the vacuums and "ripens" causing the odor..You can start preventing the scent by each time you put a new bag in to put about 2 tablespoons of baking soda in the bag when it is new, then put it in your vacuum..You can also use scented carpet powder in it as well..Me having pets I also buy flea collars and cut into 2 or 3 inch strips and put in the bag to kill any fleas or eggs that may exist from your yard and brought inside|`|qHEpR92Gaa	Well check and see if the filter needs to be emptied,you may need to wash it and let it dry in the sun.|`|P8VoBR0saa	It could be that it needs empty, its clogged or there might be something wrong with the belt that is causing it to not turn right|`|5C3zkmDOaa	That depends on the type of vaccum.

Goodluck|`|7kvTHzj0aa	i looked at the soundproof windows in the music room at my school. its actually 2 layers of window with a half inch gap in between the two layers. the glass has to be able to absorb lots of vibration so it cant be stuff like plate glass. theres a rubbery frame around the edge that makes it airtight. the gap prevents vibrations from being transferred through. to maximize performans, vaccuum as much air as you can out of the gap in between. having less of a medium for waves to travel on really blocks out a lot of sound.|`|AA10645224	MOVE    EVEN IF YOU GET THE NEW WINDOWS YOUR WALLS ARE THIN ENOUGH TO TRANFER THE SOUND    YOU WOULD HAVE TO SHUT OFF THE ENTIRE SIDE OF THAT HOUSE WITH ACOUSTIC FOAM OF FOAM INSULATION AND SOUND PROOF WINDOWS    AN OUSIDE SOUND BARRIER LIKE A FENCE WOULD DEFLECT THE SOUND AWAY FROM YOUR HOUSE    THERE IS ALSO NOISE CNCELLING EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE BUT IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE    YOU CAN ALSO GET A "WHITE NOISE" GENERATOR  OR JUST KEEP YOUR TV LOUD OR RADIO...|`|1ymL5LKlaa	Windows with insulated glass units manufactured with laminated glass are the best for sound reduction.

LoKIL5fPaa	I grow Frangipani and also a lot of sub-tropical fruit trees and chiles. I HATE miracle grow products. They are too dense for these plants. Frangipani like to be able to breath so I use Super Soil and add 1/4 th coarse sand or perlite. Go ahead and move them, but remember that they are slow growing and take a while to get to where they will bloom.  The site below is great, should give you all the info you need.  FYI, the other name for Frangipani is Plumeria.|`|WcudvcLxaa	special mix so that it flowers  also use a bigger pot  good luck!|`|AA11498082	I like miraclegro soil.  Why repot? Can you see roots in the drain holes?  If not, leave them in the pot they're in.  Plumeria need at least 6 hours of Full Sun daily to encourage bloom.  They also require a dormant period during winter - remove all foliage and reduce watering.

Architectural programs covers a lot more material than interior design.  Courses that interior design do not cover are as follows: structural, construction means and methods, mechanical, plumbing and electrical systems.  I'm not saying an Interior Design degree is easy, but it's just not the same.  For instance, you can legally work as a interior designer with a degree from a community college.  You can't refer to yourself as an architect unless you have passed the ARE.

When placed properly, they can make at least a two room radius smell fantastic. I struggled to find a product that really lasted because Febreze and all those other air sprays just don't last and candles are usually completely ineffective.    Reed diffusers have pretty much changed my life. They are absolutely amazing. Seriously, go to Pier 1 and sniff every last fragrance (they have at least 20) and I promise you'll leave with at least one. I really loved the white pomegranate but they discontinued that. In its place I've started using mango papaya.    The cool thing is that the Pier 1 diffusers last for a pretty long time. I think one of mine lasted for a month. Even after they're dry, the sticks retain the smell and can be a nice accent to a cabinet, closet, or any other small space behind closed doors.|`|3sU90myfaa	In the winter time if you have radiators for heat you go all natural(green) and set coffe cans filled with water on top of them and add vanilla extract(or any other scent of extract you prefer), any citrus peelings, apple slices, chopped up cinnamon sticks, cloves etcetera for a very nice scent.This also puts moisture in the air from the eveaporating water and prevents a dry arid heat that is a major factor in alot of sinus problems and nose bleeding in the winter from the dry heat.We used to simply keep a large pot on one burner of our cooker(stove) simmering slowly for the same effect..We also used to set a can full on our gas heaters back them, and before gas heat was so common(especially in our country rural areas) we set the cans on top of our wood heaters when this was our source of heat and cooking..You can use about any nice smelling fruit for this method that you prefer..|`|ksKDHPuraa	i love my candle.
