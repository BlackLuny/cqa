The cheap way out is to say that Owens was all our problems...but the fact is, he isn't he wasn't even 50% of our problems! The coaching (or lack of) and the lack of ball protection by our quarterback is a larger percentage along with our offensive line problems. Discipline was another major issue!

The West Indian team of the 80's was notorious for bowling bouncers, Marshall, Walsh, Ambrose and Co. doing damage to many batsmen, yet they are revered as some of the best bowlers in history, why when Australia does the same do we receive criticism?

20090307204135AAVcOLT	Sports;Basketball	NBA Finals Early Predictions?	Does anyone find it funny that anyone who analyzes these things like "I think the Lakers will win in 4-1 or 4-2 (especially after last year's game)" still haven't seen the results? I mean, everytime these predictions are made, they are dead wrong, especially if the majority take it,      For example, the Heat vs. Mavs games, everyone favored the Mavs to win, and then Heat won (Since Dirk was playing great offense at tha time). Then, the year before, everyone said that Lebron "King" woild own the Spurs, to which the boring team won. And let's not forget last year, where almost EVERYONE said Lakers will win, and look what happened.      I'm just asking, ANYONE here think that making predictions like Lakers will win in 4-2 is just stupidly ridiculous? I mean, it's like underscoring their competition, to which no one learns that when this happens, the opposing team wins apaprently. People said the same crap last year. Won't people learn to shut up with predictions, especially with sidelined comments like "Celtics suck or Lebron is no MJ or Kobe>Everyone"

20090307205954AAUQ3ji	Sports;Hockey	Did Eric Staal play in the 3rd period today?	I noticed that Eric Staal only played 13:55 today....down from his 20+ minute average.      Did Maurice feel sorry for Tampa and felt that 6 points was enough and shut him down?      Does Maurice not realize that he's in a chase for a playoff spot (or is that giving Maurice too much brain power)?      I haven't had a chanve to view that game yet, but 13:55 seems kind of low for Eric Staal...especially as he had 6 points in the first two periods.

20090307210254AARbXVc	Sports;Wrestling	Which wrestlers has the worst haters ? Cena, Hardy or HHH ?	For Me, Its Cena. I have came to terms that his Haters are Jealous. Example: I have been to Youtube and I have never seen So many Hate videos Committed to One Person. Tell Me this ? Who the Hell takes 5- Hours out of there Day to Post a Videos about a Person they Don't like ? Simply Jealousy. If you don't like a Person, than they shouldn't be in your Mouth 24/7 and Should be the last Person on your Mind to Talk about, Cena Haters are Running out of Excuses.      air time: Ok has much Air- Time has Cena had lately Compared to HHH and Orton, What a 15-Minute Promo and a 5-Minute Match, After that the Show Completely Revolves Around HHH/ Orton Feud, $$$$$$$ recognize that, Cena makes WWE alot of it, Of course he will gwt airtime.       championship reigns: how long Ago was Cena's year long title reign. What about 1-2 years ago, Its Ancient News!. Its No Excuse to hate him Anymore and His New reign wasn't even that long. It was 3 months.      He wins all the Time: When the Hell does cena win a match anymore. His PPV losing streak last year was almost worse than mvp's losing streak and the little 3 ppv's he won with His title is nothing compared back to his old days, Cena has pushed over So many guys to losing Its ridiculous.      He sucks up to fans: I have never heard any fans complain about this LMAO lol....now I know people are making up excuses to hate him, So he should be a d*ckhead to fans now.      He takes the Spot light from young Wrestlers: um...No he doesn't, the Oscar goes to HHH. compare how many guys cena has pushed and hhh has pushed.      las but not least 5-moves, Who the Hell in WWE doesn't have a limited moveset, Cena is a routine Wrestler, He no bret hart but He can wrestle, any dumbass that says he can't doesn't do their research, check his OVW days.      Before anyone gets defensive and says, Everyone has there Own Opinions and yours won't change theirs, I KNOW, If they can have there Opinions, Why in the Hell I can't.

20090307204124AAWTqWH	Sports;Martial Arts	Is hapkido effective?	I recently discovered a tae kwon do dojang where they teach a variety of martial arts like hapkido, jiu jutsu, kendo, escrima, and kickboxing. I think that they mostly incorperate hapkido with tae kwon do, and the rest are optional classes available. Would hapkido+tae kwon do be a good combination for a lot of exercise and a good way for self defense? btw, the master of the dojang is also a good instructor, since his dojang got a lot of praise for winning in tournaments and stuff, he's been training for a long time, and the costs are reasonable.

I think that overtimes should still last 5 minutes and it should be the first team to score wins, but if the teams are still tied after the first overtime they should go a second one, and a third and so on. Shootouts fun to watch but I think that there are to many of them and overtime is more fun to watch.

Last season after the Lakers made a deal for Pau Gasol from Memphis, the Suns made a deal for Shaq, and the Mavs then made a deal for Jason Kidd, and the Spurs got Kurt Thomas in an attempt to matchup with LA.

SAN JOSé, Costa Rica - Costa Rica habría vencido a México en el torneo de la Copa Oro si hubiese jugado con 11 futbolistas, aseguró a medios locales el director técnico de la selección mayor costarricense, Hernán Medford.      Con 11 jugadores le ganamos a México", expresó el estratega, quien llegó la noche del lunes al país al frente del equipo que dirigió en el torneo de la Confederación Norte, Centroamericana y del Caribe de Fútbol (Concacaf), que se desarrolla en Estados Unidos.      "Ellos con 11 jugadores y nosotros con apenas ocho, nos ganaron por un gol", se?aló Medford al referirse a la expulsión de tres miembros de la selección en el partido Costa Rica-México, celebrado el domingo y que el segundo ganó 0-1 eliminando así al primero.      Entonces, eso quiere decir que "es el peor México de la historia", reflexionó el director técnico centroamericano en declaraciones reproducidas por el diario Al Día.      este tipo esta resentido porque sus cerdos jugadores no pudieron ganar.

Todos conocemos que Judas vendió a Jesús por unas monedas, después el nazareno fue crucificado, muerto y sepultado, resucitando al tercer día, según las escrituras, de ahi tengo dos preguntas      1. Por que si Jesús fue crucificado un viernes y resucitado un domingo, se dice que resucitó al tercer día?      2. (Esta ni un experto en la materia me dió una respuesta convincente) Acaso no estaba condenado Judas a ser quient raicionara a Jesús desde antes de nacer, porque así estaba escrito, que Jesús resucitaria, ya que sin Judas no hubiera existido crucifixión ni el milagro de la resurrección, entonces, por obra de Dios, Judas nunca tuvo otra elección, estaba condenado desde un principio a entregar al todopoderoso? acaso esto no es contradictorio si dios es amor, si todo lo perdona?? porque entonces Judas no tuvo oportunidad de no condenarse a el mismo?? aun cuando pidiera perdon a Dios no estaba condenado a cometer un pecado terrible y entregar a Jesús para que fuera condenado a morir??

20090307230939AAE9pCe	Sports;Basketball	Do black people really have an advantage when it comes to basketball?	I love basketball and im a sophomore in high school. Im short, white, and skinny but im still fairly good and i played on varsity this past season. I don't understand it. Why does it seem that every level of basketball you reach less and less white people are playing basketball and more and more blacks are there. Obviously up until like 6th grade i never played any black kids. Then in 6th grade i was on my school team and we occasionally saw some blacks kids. Then by junior high we would face all black schools occasionally. My freshman year i dont remember playing any team with no black people on them. Now this year for varsity at least half the team guaranteed for every team is black and then theres a lot of all black teams too. I don't understand why if theres something like 15% of the population is black yet probably about 60% of varsity players are black at least. And the people who play D1 college the percentage gets even bigger and i dont even have to mention the pros. Counting only Americans in the NBA, its something like 95% black and 5% white (thats not including Europeans/canadians/Argentinans/Chinese/... So somehow 15% of the population accounts for 95% of the NBA. I just dont understand it. What advantage do black people have in basketball. Im not trying to sound racist or anything and Im not. I would love to hear the opinion of a black guy too.

I told him I'd be interested in going to Philly, I told him I'd be interested in going to New York, Seattle, Minnesota.      "If I could play with Adrian Peterson?

20090227120418AAXkP95	Sports;Football (American)	WHY? WHY WHY WHY BROWNS?	Why would the Browns trade Kellen Winslow. Seriously? I'm so sick of getting my hopes up every year for this team. Winslow was one of the best players they had. Sure he didn't have an incredible season last year, but who really did aside from Sean Rogers and Josh Cribbs?       This pisses me off. I swear the organization is trying to turn the city against them sometimes.      Ugh if I only I was alive during the 80's. The good years from what my parents have said.      What did they even get for him? Anyone know? Money?

20090307231008AAiNWDd	Sports;Football (American)	What team would be a good fit for LT if he were to leave the Chargers?	I'm thinking KC. With Cassel and Bowe there that may be a good fit, I'm from San Diego and am not a Charger fan although i do watch and occasionally go to the Q to watch a Charger game (my brother is a huge charger fan.) So LT going to  KC would be perfect from a spectator point of view would be perfect. San Diego has the whole Cutler vs Rivers drama with Denver, Raiders vs Chargers bitter rivalry (at least here in San Diego it is) and now KC vs Chargers would be a big local game if LT goes to KC. I'm a Niner Fan so i just pull for the Chargers because they are the home team, but i would definetly pull for KC when they play the chargers if they were to get LT. LT is a stand up guy and has been very active in the community. He is being asked to get paid less then Sprolls who i also like very much is a huge slap in the face for LT even if he is past his prime. Arizona or Cleveland  are other options. If Reggie Bush was not in N.O. the Saint would be a perfect fit.

I first get the gun take it out the package and charge the battery. 12 hours late (what the manual says to charge it for the first time) hook it up to my gun and CLICK. Same thing happened to a friend of mine's D-Boy M4 and it turned out to be the battery, so I ask him for the new battery he got to replace the old one and the gun fires right up. We put my battery in his gun and it worked in his, weird I know. Well I upgraded some of my internal parts get everything back together and man was it sweet! Then, a couple of shots later, it just stops working... back to the nice ole CLICK. now I'm thinking one of two things. 1. The upgraded spring is to much 2. the motor is bad. So, I put all the stock parts back in on his battery, another friends battery, my battery, and a 12v one I built... NOTHING! Being lucky enough my friend has almost the same gun i ask to try his motor, it does the same thing, just CLICK like it can turn the gears. Later that day pull the trigger outta boredum guess what bang bang bang. At this point im totally stumped. Now it's not working anymore with any battery or motor, just clicks one time when you pull the trigger like it don't have the power even with a 12v battery. PLZ HELP!!!

20070330215601AA148rS	Sports;Football (Soccer);Mexican Football (Soccer)	Que piensan de lo que a clara el papa de Nery Castillo?	MéXICO, D.F. -- Nery Castillo padre aseguró que su hijo mantiene sus planes de jugar para la Selección de México y no para la de Grecia, como afirmaron algunos medios helénicos de comunicación, que adelantaron un supuesto anuncio del delantero en estos días para hacer público su interés por jugar con los griegos.         "Nery sí juega para México. él va a seguir en los partidos, ya demostró que iba a ir a México, pero por la noticia de su madre (que está muy enferma), no pudo ir. Hugo está enterado, esperemos que todo salga bien, más adelante podrá ir a jugar, no podemos hablar de futbol en este momento.         "Tenemos problemas de enfermedad, porque surgió algo muy grave, Nery no se siente bien, es su mamá, y yo estoy muy triste", explicó entre lágrimas el papá del goleador, quien hizo una pausa en su charla para tomar aire y recuperarse.          "Lo que importa ahora es salir adelante pues Nery no les va a fallar", apuntó.         ESPECULACIONES    "No tiene nada que ver con rumores, él ya habló con Hugo y no hay más explicaciones", externó Castillo padre, quien dijo sentirse molesto con la Prensa, por las suposiciones sobre la ausencia del delantero en la convocatoria del Tri y calificó de "barbaridades" las especulaciones publicadas.          El padre del delantero del Olympiakos pidió que se respetara la situación que están viviendo ahora.          "En estos momentos necesitamos tranquilidad y nada más que nos ayuden y que lo entiendan, y esperemos que esto pase.         "El problema es que no podemos hacer mucha comunicación, porque la mamá de Nery no sabe nada; está en Uruguay, las noticias vuelan y no queremos hacerle da?o a la se?ora", finalizó.          VERSIONES    Los motivos de la ausencia de Nery en el Tri crearon muchas suposiciones.          Distintos medios en Grecia aseguran que los padres del atacante tienen cáncer.          En México informativos mexicanos adelantaron que su novia estaba embarazada y por eso no había viajado.

20081019171117AARCWXE	Sports;Football (American)	What is up with the media (or the NFL) trying to discredit Brett Favre?	Today, they said Favre was giving in depth details of the Packers offense to the Lions and had given information to some other teams previously.  The week he threw the 6 touchdowns, on ESPN they showed him coming into the stadium and commented that his body language made them think he didn't want to be there.  They commented they bet he wishes he hadn't ever come back.  Yeah, they got that one totally wrong.      What is up with that?  Jealousy?  Just wanting to see him fail?  Is it the NFL or the media?
