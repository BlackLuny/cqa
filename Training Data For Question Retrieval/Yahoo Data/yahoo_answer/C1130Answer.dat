urbo9yUqaa	Your hair is not protein, its DEAD protein.<br>  If you want shinier healthier hair that isn't dry then use a leave in conditioner and eat 1/4 cup of almonds everyday. Wash your hair with cold water and use a serum at the ends of your hair.|`|Vj13f7zmaa	Nothing you can put on your hair.  You have to nourish your hair from the inside.  So it will have to grow out while you eat a good diet with plenty of protein.  Hair is dead cells and cannot be nourished.|`|5KzOOjHuaa	All you have to do is go to a store(a store like Sally's Beauty Supply)<br>  and look at their hair products.<br>  They have many products that specialize in making your hair look healthier.
AA12268608	I did that to my hair actually a few weeks ago and I love it! It would look great on you :)|`|sHHZttxlaa	You're only 14 years old so i wouldn't get such a forward haircut.|`|yzrvnDusaa	I already answered so check the other one. and like i said, No. i posted some pics that were cute and would suit u better! =]|`|pv00LC3naa	yeah, or buy clip in hair extensions|`|gRPdX9fxaa	go for it! almost anyone can pull off that look so ud be safe doin it plus i personally think it would look really good|`|xv3opX9Maa	i dont think hair grows that much in 7 months <br>  but yea i think it would look good <br>  ( =|`|AQwoCjj3aa	I think that hair stlye would be great for your face shape, it would make your face seem longer.|`|dMv9y8MWaa	Yeah I think it would look good on you. Better than the haircut you have now.|`|heyWtMRpaa	maybe after your face matures a bit|`|8iQFdkIhaa	i really don't like that hair color! yuck.|`|AA12074512	you look like a troll...
7ZLS2AbNaa	try forever 21 it is probably in your budget because it is very cheap and classey for work :-]
qRICzEy9aa	Hair is most easily styled when its about 75% dry, so try just getting them alittle damp and grabbing your brush and blowdryer for a quick flix. or maybe stop using a headband and slide the bangs to the slide securing them with a bobby pin instead|`|lcWG9dj4aa	to keep your hair in the same place, use bobby pins and have a wet cloth. Take your wet cloth and wrap it around your bangs and put in the hair clips, and wait for couple minutes (10-20 minutes). When you wash your face bobby pin or clip your hair the direction the bangs go, dont pull it back.|`|cDNMB0GAaa	um wash your face FIRST...<br>  <br>  theres an idea|`|0WKW8alraa	hairspray?|`|X9xm0GXJaa	try a bobby pin, pin them diresctly to the side of your head so they'll be out of the way from your face, but still hold the correct spot. Sometimes they might stay swooped but other times they might move. if they move fix it with a straightner. when you do that straighten them the opposite way, then style them the correct way.<br>  <br>  but to tell you the truth, what you really need to do is wash your face first, before you do any of that, thats what i do.|`|lDq7u89Paa	Try using hair clips and a hair tie instead of a headband. Also get your bangs wet after you wash your face. Thats what I do and it seems to work pretty well.|`|liyjJvu8aa	i didnt have it like dat  but when i went to the salon and the stylist did it  it came out like dat  juzz  get it cut the  direction u want it and get it done|`|PnJYGIneaa	Well this is called the side swept bangs<br>  Here's a great video explaining how to get it that way!<br>  Enjoy! =)<br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJZTLSLqznk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HJZTLSLqz...</a>|`|urbo9yUqaa	Is your hair naturally straight/wavy?<br>  <br>  If so then what you can do is blow dry your hair down on your bangs and onto the side WHILE ITS STILL DAMP.

BQY6itt6aa	i tried the eyeshadow and I was not impressed, it was really chalky and it took a lot to build up to the intensity I like. and honestly, i cant justify spending 38 on a palette of 4 eyeshadows and im not gonna b able to wear it everyday|`|F57mAkXZaa	it is all colors they have done before...and most you can buy individually from the regular mac lines.  i am a mac junkie and i am not impressed.  unless your a total hello kitty fan i wouldnt bother|`|2EdVsgciaa	from what i saw, it was okay<br>  i expected real bright pinks and i guess actual chinese models<br>  they do their makeup BOMB over there <br>  hmm<br>  either way, im more of a mascara, eyeliner, and lip gloss type of girl|`|GiHOnv54aa	I agree with someone else who said Hello Kitty is for younger people. Only younger people won't be able to afford it as it's too expensive esp. compared to the normal MAC prices<br>  <br>  X|`|CvahPOtNaa	ummm.<br>  <br>  ysorry but i was really disappointed! Hello Kitty is a brand for little girls not older people!|`|sTE0FUbtaa	The packaging is REALLY cute, but I don't like the actual color of the products.|`|YCMUPkbZaa	Overrated.|`|OxUnUolBaa	I've seen better collections from MAC.|`|fia9gMHpaa	I did not like it too much.|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	i was pretty dissapointed. i think the colors are too light for what i usually expect from MAC.|`|N5qx5NUvaa	Um, I didn't go crazy about it like others. I got a few things. The only thing that I really liked from it was the pink fish lip conditioner. There's nothing really disappointing from the collection, it just turned out darker than I predicted. I thought there were going to be more pinks and reds as opposed to bright blues and black.|`|v2rhWswRaa	i only got two things from the collection, and i wasnt amazed with them. The color of some of the things are close to other mac products, but without the added price of it being "hello kitty". The only thing really good about it is how cute it is. haha.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	i dont really care what brand it is <br>  the colors are too funky<br>  i dont like funky colors<br>  <br>  people are so crazed just because its Hello Kitty|`|H6ixrUYLaa	Yeah it's definitely not my favorite.  The colors aren't up to what I expected.
kCdISEGqaa	I would be resistant to giving someone without tattoos an apprenticeship.  I am a female, with a very gentle face, and very feminine tattoos.  I know of one artist, one that I saw on a Discovery Channel special years ago, but don't remember his name or even where he was.  Other than that, all artists I know, are tattooed.  I guess my reasoning would be, why would you want to tattoo if you have no tattoos?  What is your motivation?  How will you be able to relate to clients in such a specialized field, if you haven't gone through it yourself.  Would you be able to speak from experience when they ask if it hurts?  Would you be able to speak from experience when they ask about how their tattoo is healing?  Just some things to think about.  Am I trying to discourage you?  No, I just want you to know what you might experience trying to find an apprenticeship.  If you've ever watched Miami Ink, you may recall they were looking for a shop manager, and turned people away who had no tattoos or only a few.  They said they wanted people who knew the profession and understood the art in its entirety.  A lot of people get apprenticeships after they get to know their artist, and have been tattooed many times by one or two people, usually in the same shop.|`|awskuSGBaa	You need some tattoos to show you know the scene. You dont need to be tattooed to the toe,  but yea.|`|oEM2YL6Laa	Lol. You can't just be hired as a tattoo artist- you have to do a full apprenticeship which if it is any good should be three years AT LEAST!! and I have news for you- your first tattoo is always on yourself so if all goes wrong you have not mucked up anybody else's skin and so you can gauge the pressure of the needle. If you have not experienced what pressure is needed/hurts on your self then you will never be any good at tattooing. I think you will find that a lot of a tattooists artwork has been done in training on themselves.<br>  <br>  I personally would not trust anybody who no tattoos. But on the other hand there is nothing wrong with somebody who is not plastered- I personally find that intimidating. There needs to be balance so neither extreme really is good for custom.|`|2inq4zHZaa	Technically speaking, it is difficult for just about everyone to become hired as a tattoo artist.  It takes years of practice, apprenticing, dedication, and a big lump of cash.  But appearance makes no difference.  That's not the issue.  Although not having tattoos might make customers a bit unsure about getting work done.  Most customers assume that tattoo artists do their own tattoos I think.  And, it's kind of the shop uniform.  A good shop would still hire you without tattoos, so long as you were a good artist will all the correct qualifications.|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	I dont think there's a rule that you have to look like a hard @ss to get a job as a tattoo artist. I'm more inclined to go to the nicer looking people for my body mods. I went to the same piercer 3 times who didn't have one single piercing or tattoo. He just had a nice looking face and an equally nice disposition. He did a good job on my piercings and that's all I cared about.<br>  <br>  Both of my tattoo artists are 'clean cut' looking people as well. They're a married couple, with adult children. Only one of them has a visible tattoo and he just recently got that.  <br>  <br>  They own their own business, so maybe that's not a good example, but I'd rather go to them than some dirty, mean looking person.|`|iAphlpqKaa	I wouldn't think so.. I would want a nice looking person to do my tattoo. Sometimes those fully tattooed & pierced artists can be intimidating|`|lfNUHpcEaa	Not at all!! I know what you mean because I have owned a shop for a long time & people would come in looking for a job and its the experience and talent that's what sells you, good appearance is a bonus. <br>  for years no one believed i did tattoos & piercings because of the way i looked.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	not really. someone would probably question them if they didnt have tattoos though.
X9xm0GXJaa	well i cant find any pictures with just one purple streak, but here are some hair colors you may be looking for:<br>  <br>  i dont know how light your hair is now but...<br>  <a href="http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b300/Blaxicanluv/2932_3540_Richie-Nicole-04-4x.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i21.photobucket.com/albums/b300/B...</a><br>  this is more of like a golden blonde, very pretty<br>  <a href="http://images.inmagine.com/img/Imagesource/is766/is766029.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.inmagine.com/img/Imagesour...</a><br>  this is more of a yellow-y blonde<br>  <a href="http://i.ivillage.com/BS/makeover_central/celeb_hair/BS_AshSimpson_325.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i.ivillage.com/BS/makeover_centra...</a><br>  these are like a more bronze type blonde<br>  <br>  i like all of them and to help explain it to the hairdresser you can just take the picture right in. And for the purple highlight just tell her you want one and show her wear. Theres not much deciding for that sooo yeah, hope i helped=]|`|urbo9yUqaa	Mhm, I think lighter hair would look better on you if you have pale skin. If your hair gets darker you'll just look more pale. Go to a professional or get a lightening kit ($10-15) and buy extensions that are blue/purple. $3 at CLUE in the mall if you have one or go to Hot Topic for ones that are $8 they call in all different colors.|`|lDq7u89Paa	I am the same way, olny my eyes are green. I just got the underneath layer of my hair dyed purple. It looks awesome, but you could also try darker highlights around your face, and they would look great. You could try this:  <a href="http://s162.photobucket.com/albums/t274/lizzyj03/?action=view&current=VictoriaBeckham.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://s162.photobucket.com/albums/t274/...</a><br>  somethin like that would look great!
xpZsYckoaa	in the morning wet it and spray it with salt water|`|lDq7u89Paa	Shower in the morning and flip it around while it is drying. Or blowdry it with a round brush. You could alson get it wet and then tie it up into like three messy buns and take it out when it is dryer.|`|bKwQyCEHaa	put in curlers and get them a little wet if they are the foam ones <br>  use a curling iron<br>  <br>  hope this helps

L3j2HrsJaa	I tried many, many mascaras and they all clumped my eyelashes because they were too thick. I recently tried Revlon beyond natural mascara and I finally found what I was looking for. The brush is amazing, it separates your lashes, you can build it up by applying two or three coats or put just one coat for natural but beautiful looking lashes. I absolutely love it.|`|v0FlUan0aa	rimmel lash maxxx<br>  <br>  amazing!!|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Jane Hi-Fiber. I don't know why, since it's such a simple mascara, but it works so well! My lashes look so much longer, it adds the perfect amount of volume, and they feel soft, not hard and crunchy like other mascaras (Maybelline, I'm talking to you). The brush is awesome, even though it's a weird shape. Plus, the tube is really cute and little. The look lasted all day without smudging or anything. I believe you can find them for around $2.99.|`|fYox2mwGaa	I have to agree with 3love.... my ultimate fave is the Full N Soft.  Your lashes will look so natural because this mascara does not clump and keeps your lashes soft.... just like they promise.  I also like that it does not smudge or flake... like Covergirl tends to... so there are no messy flakes on your cheeks or messy undereye smudges at the end of the day.  I just bought 2 more tubes today @ Walgreens!!!  :D|`|lMOudbdTaa	Maybelline great lash........<br>  <br>  <br>  now please answer mine<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=Ar0ovb5xj4Eq454KBK.Nq30Oxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222162956AAObXEL">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|8to6MsWuaa	difinatly cover girl last blast! It works so well and it is very inexpensive. It elongates them and doesn't clump. :) its my favorite.|`|9WKDuREDaa	Well, there is a new mascara that I just bought like a few weeks ago and it works SO WELL! It's called Sexy Curves (haha I know, a bit over the top name!) the bottle or whatever is purple (my fave clour!) by Rimmel London. It gives me soo much volume its so awesome! You can buy it at Walmart cheap. Another really good one is Define-A-Lash by rimmel london. The bottle is pink and it has no clumps and its really good too!|`|kf0mm5eGaa	Full N Soft by Maybelline, it isn't clumpy and if you use it with an eyelash curler, your lashes look gorgeous yet natural.|`|3cFFGPkIaa	Too Faced Lash Injection is ah-mazing !<br>  :)
TEW2oCF2aa	It could be that you have not washed them properly or used chemiclas for hair removal or even shaving could have caused it. Sometimes skin infection could also be a reason. Better consult a dermatologist.|`|V01NA68zaa	its stained from deodorants, it is possible to lighten it
CdBoe8XSaa	1) it's not that good for oily skin, because it seem's kinda moisturizing<br>  <br>  2) it's not too heavy at all if you don;t put on too much<br>  <br>  3) i don't think it would prevent breakouts, but it definitely doesn't cause them<br>  <br>  4) yep, anywhere where you'd buy makeup, like shoppers drugmart, wal-mart, etc.|`|Gew6pZhbaa	Liquid foundation will not help with oily skin, it will only make it worse. Powder foundation can keep your skin matte while offering light/medium coverage. I've never tried Super Stay, but I would assume it is just a basic foundation. Using anything extra on your face will not prevent breakouts, if anything it may make them worse depending on how your skin reacts to them. If you're looking for a foundation to cover blemishes and prevent breakouts, you probably won't find one. Instead, I would recommend a concealer. Most have acne medication in them to help heal breakouts and prevent new ones. Plus, you only use concealer where you need it, so you don't look overdone.|`|GItWq2mGaa	Normal-to-oily skin types seeking full coverage may want to give this foundation a chance, but those accustomed to tinted moisturizer will want to scour it off. The pump dispenses both foundation and a translucent, white "silky coverage extender" at once, which you blend while applying. SPF 12 coverage goes on silky and lasts all day, but looks war-paint thick. Any patches of dry skin will immediately stand out and look cakey, so hydrate first and blend well.|`|0aWn1Ip5aa	Yes, I think maybelline is good for you.  <br>  <br>  Like someone said earlier, you can try the dry foundations--not the liquid ones.  I think it's called wet/dry foundation or something.  I'm not sure, but you can ask a store clerk to help you or call a beautician.
FJU82Ycmaa	Next time you wash your hair either twist or braid your hair into several single braids all over your head.  Let that dry then take down the braids, your hair will be wavy but a lot more tame.  This might be best to do before you go to bed.  Good luck to you!|`|h3VqVwbQaa	Oh no you didn't!|`|WBKaeZ8xaa	well hun i say you should just cut it all off. that will solve all of your problems and then you wont have to worry about it.  im sure your boyfriend would agree. and maybe you shouldnt wear a hat either... just so you can flaunt and sport your new due =)<br>  <br>  tell me if this helps!!! =)|`|MZVvydPBaa	use a defusing nozzle and attach it to a blow dryer and use curling product|`|oPdR3FHkaa	rissa?
r6C0hqizaa	It's probably a little bit of both. But to make it not as visible try putting less on to make it more natural. Or buy bare mineral it works really good looks natural and when you look up close you can't see it. It's sort of expensive though but its worth it.|`|7VBdPtIQaa	Your probably using the wrong type of foundation. Try different types (liquid, matte, powder) as well as different brands. I've found the matte to be the best. Be careful how much you put on. Don't overdo it.|`|nddhRS5taa	use a primer. that will help. and if your face is wet/moisturized it would work better too. if you want to know a good primer, message me|`|0aWn1Ip5aa	Beauty experts advise  adding water or add lotion to foundation.  Now you can have a sheer coverage.  <br>  <br>  Too be  honest, I don't know if it is bad or not.  I think that foundation has a shelf life of about one year.

DkT8znckaa	I doubt you have sun spots. Mostly older people, and people with more fair skin get them. You could, but African-Americans don't damage as easily with sun exposure. If you have acne, it probably is scarring or blackheads. I'm sure you wash your face (I hate how when you ask skin questions people say "Wash your face," It's kind of common sense to wash your face.) Some products take up to two months to start showing results. Try going to a dermatologist who can give you prescription topical creams. I used to have a lot of blackheads on my chin, and then I went to the dermatologist and they cleared up.|`|OMPSzNUdaa	maybe... blackheads?<br>  <br>  just wash your face regularly, and hopefully they will go away!|`|7SvSazrfaa	It could be poo-poo. <br>  Be careful with that poo-poo.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps :)|`|kj507W26aa	They are called  " Sun Spots" and cant be removed with anything over the counter.   Start wearing lots of sunscreen daily, to avoid them from getting darker and bigger.<br>  For older people, they refer to them as "Age Spots or Sun Spots" too.|`|XqmJKlmwaa	well to make it go away<br>  wash your face every day<br>  and dont wear tooooo much makeup<br>  <br>  if it doesnt go away or still bugs you<br>  see a doctor

One half hour in one equals about 5-6 hours under the sun unprotected. It can also cause skin cancer. Tell her to self-tan or get spray-tanned.

1pxKM9Buaa	At some salons there are books to look at, and you just pick what you want. However, what you want done sounds easy enough as to when you walk in and its your turn you just tell the hair dresser what you want done and then they find the right color etc...<br>  The cost can depend on how long your hair is (longer=more expensive), the brand of dye they use, and just the overall salon. <br>  ($40ish dollars, maybe more, maybe less... that is the price I've seen a lot.)<br>  It doesnt take that long, an hour or so, once again depending on the salon. <br>  <br>  I don't think it matters about getting lowlights or whole head color for the first time. Since youre not using a bleach base, i really think it can be your preference. <br>  the lowlights might look cute for spring tho ..<br>  <br>  good luck, it sounds like your hair will come out very cute either way. (:|`|AA12268608	You should def look at some pictures online, like google hair with highlights or something. I just dyed my hair blondish on top and dark underneath and loved it! Otherwise you can go into the salon and ask them what color do they think would look best on you (they usually know the best answer). It usually costs between $40-$60 depending if you get highlights or just do one color.|`|urbo9yUqaa	It depends on what salon you go to. Some are very cheap and some are very pricey. Yes, they let you choose your color from a big book and I suggest you get low lights because every time someone gets highlights it looks a little fake.|`|cJd4SRL9aa	If you're just going a little darker, I wouldn't worry about just getting lowlights.<br>  You may as well just go for the whole thing. Since it's pretty close to your natural color, if any spots are missed, it won't look unnatural :]<br>  <br>  Personally, when I dye my hair darker I just use the box stuff from the grocery store, which costs anywhere from 5 to 15 dollars. It takes about 20 minutes, and you obviously get to pick the color.<br>  When I'm going lighter, I go to a salon. They don't make up your color, - you either bring in a picture of the color you want, or they give you some samples.<br>  At my salon, hair dying costs about $75 (cut and color). Just getting highlights took about 2 hours or so.|`|nddhRS5taa	well it really all depends on where you go. more expensive salons can cost 40-50 sometimes, but idk if you are just getting your hair dyed. normally if you ask for a color book they would just give you one, or just tell the person doing your hair that you just want it a shade darker.

8f1d1853d8165fc396dd6979c6b5d286aa	Honestly, all those sheepskin boots like Emu and Ugg are not designed to be worn the way most people wear them, and you really shouldn't expect more than a few months of wear from them. Basically one season. Like they are not a winter boot, but people wear them everyday through all kinds of bad weather. The soles cannot handle cold weather (like snow cold). The sold becomes hard when frozen and wears faster. They are a fall and spring fashion boot, not a winter boot.<br>  <br>  Price is not an indicator of how long a shoe will last. I don't expect an $800 pair of Manolo Blaniks to last any longer than a $50 pair of Jessica Simpsons.|`|v0FlUan0aa	i'd contact emu. b/c im pretty macys doest care. my emus are like wearing down. so i guess you could take it to a shoe repair or something!|`|AA12361841	Take them back. they are defective.if they don;t have another pair they may offer you a store credit.*|`|xCifmFfkaa	If you can find the reciept, bring those suckers straight back to Macy's.<br>  <br>  And for future reference, just because a pair of boots (or any shoe, really) costs a lot of money does NOT mean that they are made well.<br>  <br>  You could've bought Airwalks at Payless for $40 and those would probably still be okay; I've been wearing $20 no-name look-alikes from A.J.

NOT worth the $120.|`|xiytEI0Raa	i have a pair of emu boots from macys too.<br>  the bottom always wares off. if you were them alot the bottom will start peeling off. i own both a pair of uggs and emus, they both start peeling off from the bottom when they get old.

GItWq2mGaa	as soon as I got home, I got a new makeup wedge and pumped 1 dollop of the TruBlend. The package says to use a 'pea sized' drop. That's exactly how much 1 'pump' will dispense. So I dabbed it on and started to blend it in all over my face. At first, I thought I made a huge mistake. It seemed way too light and seemed streaky. I continued to blend it in until I thought it was the best I could get it. Then the miracle happened. About 1 minute after I finished applying the TruBlend and I was finishing my eye makeup, the makeup was invisible on my skin. It really had blended into my skin. I had perfect coverage that matched perfectly. This was a first for me. I have been using TruBlend for almost 3 months and still have the same bottle. It really does last a long time since it pumps out the exact amount you will use. I do sometimes use another dollop if I want extra coverage under my eyes or if my nose has red spots. TruBlend comes out as a liquid but when you apply it, it feels really silky almost like powder. I can't feel it at all when I have it on. It doesn't dry my skin and doesn't make my skin oily. It's just perfect all around.|`|4d6c3d0b31cdd0d3e713e6f283397254aa	I love troubled but only the whipped foundation its the best and it's so light that's the only foundation that matches my skin 100% but the regular liquid trublend sucks|`|lPCjNkEnaa	If you have an oily nose and forehead (T zone) then get Covergirl Oil Control Liquid Foundation with Covergirl with Fresh Look Pressed Powder lightly and only in the places you need it (T zone). <br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=clean_oil_control_makeup" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.covergirl.com/products/product.jsp?productId=fresh_look_pressed_powder" rel="nofollow">http://www.covergirl.com/products/produc...</a>

Nk5QTfrOaa	in my opinion, too much make-up at a young age is unatrractive.<br>  but if all your friends are doing it, here's something that looks nice on young girls:<br>  1) run the eyeliner RIGHT OVER your top eyelashes. that way your eyelashes look longer and fuller. dont go over the top, though- just right along your lash line.<br>  2) then run the eyeliner half way along the bottom, starting from the outer tip of your bottom eye not from the inner where your eye meets your nose. make the line thinner as you get closer to your nose, until it fades completely.<br>  3) if your eyes are really nice and bright, you can pretty much go along the whole way though. the black really makes your eyes pop! so if you have good eyes, just keep going with the eyeliner and surround the whole eye.<br>  4) find your own style. a little lip-gloss in a good flavor and some mascara also helps!!<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  please note: that eye-makeup makes bags. all the make-up you wear now, will catch up to you in the future! so all those pretty girls out there wearing tons of make-up, just know that in twenty years the're going to look 40 years older than their actual age!

Gold, violet/lavender, or neutral eye shadows would look pretty on your top eyelid. A tint of a pink blush, maybe powder or foundation if necessary, and a clearish pink gloss would top it all off.<br>  <br>  And for your clothes, black shirts would look pretty with your eyes but i wouldnt wear a lot of it because its a very depressing color and is mostly for special occasions.<br>  <br>  I hope that helped:)|`|SCeIOtZpaa	Since you are 12 you don't want to give off a trashy look by wearing too much.

SLd6eWbbaa	Heyyy<br>  <br>  Well yes and no, It is bad to Shampoo your hair everyday because of many products that just simply wash out your natural oils and minerals in your hair. However, theres no problem with washing your hair with conditioner, (afterall the conditioner's roll is to moisturize, detangle, ect.. in  your hair.) Many people with naturally curly hair condition their hair for control, and frizz- control, which is definitley fine. <br>  <br>  From what i iknow, there isn't yet a shampoo that can help make your hair grow faster... sorry if i let you down lol<br>  <br>  hope i helped<br>  peace.|`|JLPCENrjaa	Yes, it is recommended that you only wash your hair when "it feels or looks dirty" - you have  natural oils released from your scalp. As for a good shampoo that helps hair grow, I bought a horse-shampoo (Can not recall the name) but you can buy it at Tractor Supply or WalMart. It is for horses and "claims" to help hair grow faster - I usually have slow-growing hair and after using this shampoo for several months I saw a small but noticeable increase in growth - that worked for me but you will have to use it and judge for yourself. It's not expensive and definitely worth the try - good luck.|`|bT9SXnYQaa	Not if you use a good conditioner.<br>  I don't know that there is anything to make hair grow faster..|`|K8shRjphaa	yupppp|`|rjsB4oDkaa	yes because your hair has natural oils that nurture your hair and when you wash evrday you are just washing  those oils away and thats bad|`|frhF0X6aaa	yes

I'm guessing 7th grade or up in high school, so I'll go from there. You basically want some type of purse with cute doodles on it or something, if you want to be unique but not out of place. You also want to choose a color that can coordinate with the color you wear most often.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/62/0/AAAAAt6NX6oAAAAAAGIJIQ.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.kaboodle.com/hi/img/2/0/0/62/...</a><br>  <br>  The link above is a lovely purse I wear all the time that I get nice comments on. It's a Nollie purse that you can probably find on eBay. Also, any brown bag with a little funky design somewhere would look cute, too. Or a jean purse is always nice. Never forget that you can add your own iron-on patches, or pin on some buttons, like smiley faces or celebrity ones. Have fun and be creative! You can find a lot of stuff that won't look "cheap".

ktBWP1Uxaa	Funny, I was just looking at that kind of stuff. If you have oatmeal, cook it like you usually would for consumption. When it's done, let it cool and spread it on your face. Leave it on for about 5 minutes and rinse off with warm water. Another thing, baking soda and water. Make it into a paste and gently rub it onto your face for about 10-15 seconds, in a circular motion. Then, rinse with warm water. If you want more, Google "Beauty tips for dry face" or anything to that effect. Lime or lemon juice, olive oil and milk will also work.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	no but i use bath and body sugar scrub  its great you can leave some of the oil on face just rinse with water its great  try it!   they have vanilla scrub  spearmint scrub for summer peach   its all wonderful|`|b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	I like to mix a packet of sugar [like the kind you get in restaurants... idk about you, but I have a lot of those lying around!] into a dime-sized drop of face wash.  I apply it to my dry face, rub it in for 30 seconds or so, then lather up and wash it off.  It's pretty great.

AA11262499	sup! i am 12 turning 13 in july but i had long hair and strait with side bangs then i straighten it but it did not look good. so i got my hair cut about a week and a half ago and its shorter now with shorter side bangs with layers!!! it look so good becuase when i starighten it and use de-frizzer my natural highlights come out and hte natural wave. it;s so sleek shiny and pretty!!!!!!!!! BUT since it must be long for dance (i can toatly inderstand) you cant put short hair in a bun. so keep it long. get side bangs if your instrucor lets u have hair down.. or get longer side swept bangs with long layers tell your hair stylist to take a half of an inch  off or an inch or so (for split ends) and ask her this  "give me volumized long layers and some side swept bangs,but not to short. thanks" HOPE THIS HELPS!!!!!!!!!! :)|`|GeIidkyAaa	well. i have layers and my hair is dirty blonde too. i say dont get straight bangs because that would look wierd..|`|QwD1EvVYaa	layered hair and maybe some chopped hair like emo peeps maybe like:<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SUkRTthKJuI/AAAAAAAADXI/MNRk_-e6pAc/s320/Black+Emo+Hair-T+(5).jpg" rel="nofollow">http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_NO2UOMMYKZ0/SU...</a> except longer ???
a8fVPs6waa	Could we just trade hair?  I have to straighten mine!
8IfePMa3aa	Something like that shouldn't take more than a few hours, one sitting is very possible as long as you can sit still. <br>  With text you must be very careful about size. General rule of thumb: anything under 1/2" will turn into an unfixable blob as you get older.|`|kCdISEGqaa	Not a good idea.  The words will run together and with time, look like a big blob of faded black ink.  I wouldn't recommend it.  I'm not trying to be rude, but if you want it to last, you might want to consider something different.  You may have trouble finding an artist that would do it for you.  I would recommend getting the first two lines, in bold, large letters that will stand the tests of time.  Best wishes!|`|LBHJaqXoaa	You would be surprised at what a talented tattoo artist can accomplish when it comes to requests like these. If you have a large enough area of skin on which to put it, then it sounds like it's possible. <br>  <br>  Don't be afraid to go to your tattoo artist, if it can't be done, then you don't have to know what else to get right off the bat. It's okay to take your time and make sure you pick the perfect picture or phrase. But I believe that a talented artist could get all 37 words in the size and type of font you want. <br>  <br>  I believe you could do it in one sitting. And it shouldn't run together if you treat it right. Keep it out of the sun because sun is the #1 killer of all tattoos. Just use sunblock on it or keep clothes on it and you should be fine. Today's inks are much more resilient and technological than they were a few years ago and they last alot longer than they used to.|`|6LJzt2ngaa	im thinking youre gonna have to up the font size. just because of fading and what not. usually writing doesnt take a ling time to do. i got 22 letters done in pretty big font in about 40 minutes. it could work, you just need a bigger are. maybe youre back? or youre outer thigh? like down your leg? then again, the tattoo could mean more if it was just the couple lines.|`|6w7FKrlfaa	anythings possible.  talk to your tattooist.  it's going to be very expensive.  but it's worth it, if you're set on it.  yeah a 14 or 16 font would be more ideal.  the smaller the writing the more chance u have of it all running in together later in life.  bigger clearer writing will prevent this a lot.  think about the placing etc..  i normally print out my tattoo idea and cut it out and tape on my skin.  making sure i am 100% happy with it.
kCdISEGqaa	Don't think anything of it.  You didn't upset the artist, it's not always expected.  If I'm not tipped, I don't take it personally.  I can tell by the look on a person's face how happy they are when I am finished.  Since you paid with a credit card, and it was a $350 tattoo, he may have assumed you had no cash for a tip.  Did he appear to be upset when you left, or was he cordial?  Remember, he just made $350, and if he was the shop owner, it's all his money.  I wouldn't worry too much about it, don't let it stress you out.  Not everyone tips, and quite honestly, we don't all expect it.  Here's my advice, next time you get tattooed, go back to him.  When you leave, give him a tip, a simply say thanks.  You're fine.|`|vDky5V15aa	I usually tip 10-20% depending on the total on a piece. Most artists tell you that it is not necessary to tip but in fact that is where they make the majority of their money. After they pay booth rent and pay for supplies and their equipment they really don't make a lot on each tattoo. So the tip is pure profit for them. <br>  <br>  Considering my artist charges $150 an hour it sounds like you got a good deal, so I would say yes, send him the money. He would most definitely appreciate it. You might even send one of those Visa gift cards. That way your covered if it is lost in the mail, and he can use it as cash in most places.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	Send him an email and thank him, and sending a good final pic is also a good idea. Sending a check for a tip is entirely up to you. If you are having that strong gut feeling that you should, then do it. We have those feelings for a reason. <br>  <br>  If it were up to me, next time I go visit my family I would go in to the same guy for another tattoo and give him a big tip that time, saying "and this is also to cover for the last one." Until then I wouldn't feel bad about it. <br>  <br>  Hope this helped!|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	It might be kind of weird now. I would just send a picture of the final work, and tell him how much you love your tattoo. Maybe tell him you've recommended him highly. If I were a tattoo artist, I'd probably appreciate someones gratitude, and high reccomendations, over a 20 dollar tip.. That's just me though.<br>  <br>  If you want you could order a box of candy or those fruit bouquets and have it sent to him with a note ...that might be a bit much though.|`|br1FB5rraa	Well I mean yea ur suppose to tip them and everything, but obviously if they charged you 350 bucks for it, they are already making quite a profit, so it should be alright.|`|md66E0LWaa	NOT COOL ya I would send a gift card a picture and thanx|`|7n523JW1aa	It's not a big deal. Maybe send him an email saying thank you again for the great job but don't bother. I like it when I get tips for my good job on tattoos but if someone doesn't tip me it's not a big deal. Don't stress.|`|h9v7SQNlaa	Its to late now. If you arent planning on going back to that place anytime soon....just brush it off. It's not that big of a deal! Especially if you won't be seeing him again for a long while. No worries.....don't drag it on. Whats done is done. Move on now.  :<br>  <br>  :-)|`|bT9SXnYQaa	98% of the money goes back to him anyway.<br>  All you really paid for was the ink.|`|1hS5vJW4aa	dudee that just makes it more weird. oh well its not a big deal
Ou6yW1r5aa	You should DEFINETLY wash your hair. It isnt very good hygene and you will probably get made fun of at school becuase you hair will start to stink. You can get blow dryers really cheap for like 14 dollars at walmart. You could also get a good shampoo and conditioner for 120 dollars. I would recommend herbal essences.<br>  you could maybe get some sponge rollers for your hair too if you dont want to apply heat.<br>  Hope I helped!|`|2I5XqMDzaa	thats just gross! use some dish soap and go wash it jeeze|`|lXGtDNZzaa	why doesn't she wash her hair?<br>  <br>  does she not let you wash your hair?<br>  <br>  try using some baby powder if you have it, with water.<br>  <br>  that can work as shampoo in a pinch.|`|M5Sa85Ssaa	give money to wone of ur friends to buy u some stuff and then have them bring the stuff to skool for u

The secret is to always use a deep conditioner, and about once a week, use a mayonnaise hair mask. No, it won't make your hair fall out because it's not affecting the root of your hair. It can, however, make your hair brittle. But again, if you are moisturizing it properly, it shouldn't be a problem. Also, make sure you are eating a full, healthy diet. Using a hair serum specifically made for use prior to heat treating hair can help protect the strands as well.<br>  <br>  :)|`|LdlNMvsbaa	Straightning your hair deffinately isnt good for it, but if you have to straighten it, deffinately use a heat protection in your hair!

LJPR6Sj6aa	I think it could look cute on you : ). The oval face is actually the perfect face shape that is LUCKY! People with faces that lean more towards an oval in shape can look best in most any style. I would say keep it whatever length you have it, maybe get it layered some (this should add some body), and go for those side bangs! It would look cute I'm sure! I'm not sure if you would be cutting your own hair or going somewhere.....If you're going somewhere then I guess you just have to get them to do it, but if you're a rebel like me then you can cut if yourself hahahaha. My biggest tip is to not cut STRAIGHT ACROSS!!! At least, if you're going for an emo look!! especially on your bangs. I mean- the bottom of your hair won't matter as much but you'll have a straighter look to it.Cut with the scissors at an angle going upward. It may sound silly but google it! : ) It helps feather our your hair on the end so it's not so uniform and straight. You may want to do this for the rest of your hair if you decide to go shorter with it (you didn't say how long it was ^^;;....). How I cut mine is I always (no matter what length I want) part my hair in the back straight down the middle and pull my hair on either side of my neck like Im going to be making pigtails, then I just lop off each side and make sure they are about even. This works well for me because I like the front being a little bit shorter and the back being a little bit longer. As for layers you could go completely crazy and go where most your hair is short and you have layers under it, or just have choppy layers ( my personal favorite ^_^ ). Choppy layers are easy, you just grab relatively small peices of hair (about the size of a video game controller wire) or larger depending on your preference and cut it off, then repeat around your hair until you like the effect! Vary the lengths and only do it with some pieces (not all your hair!!! O.o). be sure you dont forget to do the back of your hair too!! And go SLOW because you don't wanna do too much or do a piece too short or something and regret it later! <br>  <br>  Reguardless, I think I focused more on HOW to do a hairstyle than what to do. Sorry about that! My advice is just that I believe an emo haircut would work well with you going by your face shape and I think doing layers may add some body to your hair : ). Also when you get out the shower you should bend forward and toss your hair forward (the blood will rush to your head if you bend too far over!! haha so dont do that ^_^) and brush it up and blow dry it like this as if you want it to sit up straight and defy gravity (and look like some sort of crazy Dragon Ball Z character or Marge Simpson!) When you flip your hair back up when it's dry then that should have helped it get a bit more body too. Ive also seen people do that whole back teasing with a comb with emo styles...I dont know about you but personally I have tried it and I dont like it. I could see it being damaging to your hair and you're basically going around with matted hair all day, I have the desire to always brush my hair out if it gets windy and if you do this with backcombed hair then you will be brushing out all the backcombing work you did haha. : ) I hope I helped even just a little bit!!!! <br>  <br>  Oh! and as for hair color! Don't do too much with bleaching and dying your hair (etc) because over time it's not good for it; however, doing this once in a while I don't see the harm in it : ). So if you want to go blonder then go for it!! Be careful though because Ive had lots of friends who tried to go blonder and they came out looking orange (even when done professionally!!!) I would actually just do it partially blonder if you do anything. Maybe either do blond highlights, maybe an extra blond strip in the front or some other color, or maybe blonder tips. <br>  <br>  This is me btw!! <3 (and that glowing light that Im holding is a lamp without the lampshade haha). <br>  <a href="http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/images02/13/l_5faa7fb3bc91460c8f9f4c8f914aea3a.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://c3.ac-images.myspacecdn.com/image...</a>|`|GR2XNzCCaa	I say get choppy side swept bangs and layers. And it should be okay even if you have thin hair. Get layers though. It will look nice. :)|`|M0CZzSMOaa	I personally, just based on the description, think it would look good. The bangs should look fine with your face shape. They're pretty flattering. Thin or thick doesn't really matter either, in fact it will make the bangs look better if your hair is thin because the hair will be more willing to lie flat and succumb to your will XD. I say go for it!

If the piercing does happen to get infected, do not remove the jewelry - as this will only trap the infection an make it harder to get rid of. You can take it out right now, but as said, it will most likely heal fine.  Make sure you're wearing good quality jewelry (the earring the pierce you with is usually not the best stuff - so, I'd go to a local tattoo shop and have them put in a good quality ring for you).  Keep it clean - either soap or sea salt soaks (if you do go to a tattoo shop, they can tell you the best aftercare method).   Other than that, just don't mess with it and do your research before getting pierced next time.|`|PPvk105Caa	Ok relax, you're not going to die. You know how many people get nose piercings everyday?? Thousands. All you need to do is care for it, clean it, don't put make-up near it or on it, don't use any lotions on it, when wasting your face, use mild soap for the next few weeks until the pierced skin is fully healed. Don't pull on it, or change the ring until it's fully healed, or else you can tear the skin. <br>  Make sure not to get any shampoo or food into it. <br>  Clean it after you shower, in the middle of the day & before you go to sleep. <br>  If you do all these things, you'll be fine.

AA11448838	I just purchased it a couple of weeks ago.  It separates and lengthens lashes, but It definetly doesn't volumize as it claims. The only problem I have with this mascara is that it does run and you end up with dark circles under your eyes by noon.  Not a good look.  If it weren't for that it would be perfect. I really like Diorshow, but I find it difficult to pay $24 for a mascara!|`|GItWq2mGaa	What I like about it most is the applicator wand. It’s shaped somewhat hourglass-like which makes it easier than normal to get to my inner and outermost lashes and made of plastic bristles. The best part though, is that it doesn’t get mascara on my eyelid! It seems that no matter how careful I am with other mascaras, I always seem to get some of it on my lid while I’m swiping (very inconvenient). So this one wins me over in the application department.|`|0HOgU1TZaa	i've never tried buxom so i don't know what to tell you about it

VUgzZMnIaa	I think you should go with the turquoise....because you have pink undertones in your skin, the pink in your hair just might be overkill.

This question is almost like asking "how should my boobs look? should I get breast enhancement surgery?" <br>  <br>  Changing your hair according to what a guy would like means you have to live with an image that caters to a guy's expectations. You should make your own decision based on what YOU like. What YOU want. Don't think otherwise or you'll let men run your life.<br>  <br>  And honestly, if a guy doesn't want to be with me because of my hair, then I don't want to have a relationship with him.

VUgzZMnIaa	When it is just laying flat against your head like that, well, it doesnt help. Waves will give it some volume, even if you don't like wearing your hair in waves. For the time being, while your hair is growing out, get some volumizing spray and curlers and plump ur hair up a little. <br>  P.S.- I would either not go to that hairstylist again, or buy her a ruler.|`|cYktV9B5aa	Sue the lady. ;3<br>  It doesn't look terribleee!!

Sorry.|`|l5Q8lq35aa	You could make it look absolutely adorable if you just add volume. <br>  Flip your head over and blow dry it (damp, or dry, doesn't matter)<br>  all over. For some people, it will look fabulously wind-blown, but<br>  for others, not so much! I'd recommend finding pics of girls with<br>  a similar cut. Go to a different salon, and just ask if they can<br>  help you make it look like that. They don't need to cut it, but<br>  just give you some styling advice. Call them up and tell them<br>  that beforehand. I've done that before and they've given me some<br>  GREAT tips on how to make my hair more manageable and cute.<br>  <br>  Here are some examples you could use to bring with you (for<br>  women with thin hair):<br>  <a href="http://www.hairstyleschat.com/images/cute-short-hair.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstyleschat.com/images/cut...</a> (I really<br>  love how this one is not as girly, but very sexy and still feminine.)<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.hairstyles123.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/11/short-hair-styles-prom-cuts-of-sedu.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairstyles123.com/wp-content/...</a> (Just the bangs on this one.

It's such a wonderful change than to what you're usually accustomed to, and I think you would look great blonde - generally most blue-eyed people are. If you feel you want to change it back later on, you could do that, too. But if you are going to, I would do it during a time when you are going to have a pretty long break so you can get yourself used to the color and see whether or not you like it, so in case you don't, you can always dye it back before anyone sees.|`|1XxVxFikaa	its really hard to make dark hair to blonde.i tryed to,i have really dark hair too(both of my parents have black hair.)and i tryed making it blonde and i got copper orange!i endded up dying it back the same night!dont do it,show blondes that darker haired girls have more fun!|`|ZRxdTn2Laa	Your eyebrows are dark, so unless you bleach them or something, I think that going blonde would look slightly odd.<br>  You could go to a very light brown, I think that would look nice. <br>  Although the dark brown enhances your eye colour.<br>  :)|`|H2tkkWyPaa	I think caramel blond highlights would look great on you but if you went totally blond you would look washed out.|`|BOUlr1OMaa	no! you already look like the rest of them with that shirt anyway! lol. seriously I'd stay brunette, you're blue eyes really pop with it. :)|`|3cADVRxaaa	the eyes are too light for that|`|bMk6xZaSaa	NO WAY! you are GORGEOUS the way you are in that pic! :)|`|rmtfJa75aa	i think u should stay a brunnette<br>  dark hair makes light eyes pop :)
AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist.<br>  <br>  It depends on your skin type. Mac foundations come in two types of undertones, yellow and pink. Sometimes the colors vary with certain foundations. They also offer a much wider range of colors, from super light to deep dark.<br>  <br>  If you have Oily or Combo skin, the best foundation is Studio Fix fluid (comparable to Revlon Colorstay liquid*), or Studio Fix powder (comparable to Revlon Colorstay powder*). Both keep your skin matte throughout the day, and blend really nicely into the skin without being cakey or heavy feeling. It's by far their most popular foundation! If you use SFF with the 187 brush it leaves you with an airbrushed look!<br>  <br>  The best powder is Blot powder. It's a sheer blotting powder you dust over your t-zone to prevent oilies from ruining your makeup. The only thing comparable to this in drugstores is blotting film or blotting papers, but no actual powders. <br>  <br>  Right now I am a huge fan of Studio Sculpt. It's a gel formula and blends effortlessly, feels light, and makes my skin so smooth. It does leave a dewy finish, so if you have oilier skin, it may not work for you. Right now I don't think their are any drugstore comparables..but it's so worth the money!<br>  <br>  Their bronzing powder in Matte Bronze is by far the best bronzer I have found. It's red-based, so it doesn't turn you orange. I don't know of a drugstore brand bronzer that doesn't leave you orange, sorry! :(<br>  <br>  I also love their Full Coverage foundation, but sadly they are discontinuing it. You only need a small pea size amount to cover the entire face flawlessly. It does feel a little heavy and if you don't apply it right it can be cakey looking. I would use Max Factor's Pan-Cake* foundation instead...i've heard great things!<br>  <br>  Some others I have tried, but don't think are the "best" are:<br>  - Studio Tech (creme to powder, try Milani Creme to Powder* or Max Factor Creme to Powder* foundation)<br>  - Mineralize Skinfinish Natural (sheer mineral powder)<br>  - Mineralize Skinfinish (high frost metallic mineral powder)<br>  - Studio Stick (try Max Factor's Pan-Stik*)<br>  <br>  *Please note that the "comparables" are just that. They may not work the same, or even work at all for you, but they are the closest match  available at the drugstore. I always recommend getting higher quality foundation, as it makes a huge difference in your skin's appearance. You can always purchase mascaras, eyeliners, lipsticks and blushes at the drugstore.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|Yue2YKTnaa	MAC isnt the best<br>  there foundations kind of have a yellow tint to it

AhulHZ2daa	I am a makeup artist and I work for Mac.<br>  <br>  If an item is limited edition and it is Sold Out, most likely they will NOT restock it - once it's gone it's gone. But you may be able to find it in stores still. The website gives you information from the warehouse, not the stores...so technically they do not have any more in stock at the warehouse. Try a local Mac counter or store, or call the 1-800# to see if they may get the product back in stock, and if not, could they see if a store could send it to you.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps! :)|`|H6ixrUYLaa	No, they should restock.
2inq4zHZaa	I happen to like facial tattoos.  Or any tattoos for that matter.  But people will definitely give you crap for having them.  I am discriminated against all the time for arm tattoos, and facial piercings, so I would think facial tattoos would be about the same as piercings.  Only you can't remove the tattoos.  It really sucks.  But it all comes down to how much you value your job, compared to how much you value your human rights.  I really doubt your employers would let facial tattoos slide in a shcool.  It will be noticed eventually.  So you pretty much either have to pick your career, or pick your beliefs.  It's hard to have both sometimes.  <br>  I think it sounds really nice though.  I love seeing facial tattoos on women, it is very bold and unusual.  I hope you can find a way to get around the rules.<br>  As for everyone who says you will regret it, screw them.<br>  What they think doesn't matter, and you were not put on this earth for thier judgement or viewing pleasure.  What matters is what you think and how you feel about your appearance.<br>  When people age, they get wrinkles, age spots, thier faces change, everything sags, they look like totally different people than they did in thier twenties.  So what difference are three tiny blue stars going to make?  They make it sound like the rest of your face will be magazine cover worthy, but those stars will deform into horrible corroded blobs that protrude from your face.  Yeah.  By the time people regret thier tattoos because they have faded and such, they are already 100 more times depressed that they are no longer young and youthful looking.  I wouldn't worry too much about that.<br>  Your big worry is your career.  Talk to your administrators about it first.  And really, really think long and hard about it.  I love tattoos of all kinds, but I realize what a big deal they are.  It is permanent and there for life.  So make sure you are ready to commit.  Just don't let soicety change your mind.  Decide for yourself.  :)<br>  <br>  PS:  Try drawing the stars on with eyeliner for a few weeks.  It will give you a good idea of how much you would like having tattoos on your face.  Just make sure you draw them on everyday!|`|d42c34ff42d7b1a4c999f30da1751f64aa	I love tattoos..<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I think facial tattoos are a horrible idea. <br>  <br>  1- Tattoos aren't quite as socially acceptable as I'd like. People still frown on them, so unless you're set for life, you should keep your tattoos in a place that can be hidden, if needed. (for job interviews, etc). You dont know if you're going to be working in the same place forever, especially if you go ahead with the tattoos on your face idea.<br>  <br>  2 - I hate it when people say 'think of how they'll look when you're 612 years old!! - However, your face is exposed to the elements constantly and therefore, ages faster than other parts of your body. An aged , wrinkley tattoo on your arm or leg isn't a big deal. What 80 year old walks around in shorts and tank tops anyway? But an aged wrinkley tattoo on your face? I'd think about that one.|`|VlTGV9DUaa	Teachers probably would frown upon this yes, but if its not against the rules it doesnt matter, if u want it get it..<br>  <br>  but i really dislike facial tattoos, in 5 or even 20 years imagin what ur gonna look like with blue stars on your face, even if you dont agree with me now, you'll regret it so bad! it'll look ridiculous when ur like 35-40+<br>  <br>  i think tattoos are best in places that arent on show all the time!|`|B3cPFhssaa	I think facial tattoos are stupid,and i don't understand why you'd risk losing your job over this.<br>  <br>  Just covering them wouldn't be enough - students have to take piercings etc out,and the same rule applies for teachers.<br>  <br>  Even if the rule doesn't apply now - the kids will find out,and i can gurantee they'll kick up a fuss about you being allowed it.|`|7hIwM2jzaa	you can get camoflauge kits for tattoos, scars and strech marks. <br>  I love tattoos iv got bout 9 of them but i make sure there covered for work, interviews, and for more formal things.<br>  You can buy camoflauge kits online and work much better than normal foundation for covering up. <br>  I personally wouldnt have a problem with my son being taught by someone with tattoos but some parents might.

How would a Police Officer be considered if he had a tattoo on his face? (Except it wouldn't be allowed), how about a Surgeon, GP, Nurse, Banker, Trader, Customs Officer? I am suprised you even have to ask the question. In ten years time may hate it. I'm 43 and think back to when I was 33 and I'm completely different. If when I was 33 I'd been given a photo of me as I am now I would have thought, 'What a square'. Now anyone in their 40s still trying to be 'oh so alternative' just appears to be an attention seeker.|`|7z4ff2Whaa	nah, don't be silly, tats are pretty cool but not on the face,u will be seriouosly looked down upon as a teacher. choose another body part.|`|i2ZAVM2aaa	I don't think you need all the that attention do you|`|WYa3UY6Gaa	You would more than likely lose your job.<br>  <br>  I'm pretty sure they wouldn't have a teacher with a tattoo on their face. <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  I doubt the arm of the glasses would cover it completely ( could be wrong )<br>  <br>  Still my suggestion is to not. I don't frown upon people just because they have a tattoo no matter where it is. <br>  <br>  BUT I don't agree with facial tattoo's. NO WAY to hide it...ever.<br>  <br>  I think with your career choice I would pass on getting it on your face.<br>  <br>  Good luck|`|kCdISEGqaa	Many artists won't do facial tattoos, it's just too extreme. I am a tattoo artist, and my husband is a high school teacher.  He has tattoos on his wrists, and doesn't have to cover them.  Many of his coworkers have visible tattoos, and they don't have to cover them.  However, facial tattoos are never a good idea.  Your face should be the one place over any other, that you don't mess with.  I personally think facial tattoos degrade the art, and make others think it is a rebellious action.  People with facial tattoos are seen as extremists, and they are often looked down upon.  I think as a teacher, you would have enough common sense not to tattoo your face.  Even though my husband's district doesn't have a tattoo policy, if they want to get rid of you, they'll find a way.  I'm sure yours would too.  Be smart about it, it's your face.|`|LBHJaqXoaa	I don't like facial tattoos, but that's just me. I have visible tattoos on my arm, and I do get discriminated against for it. But I can also cover them. A tattoo on your face would be extremely hard to completely cover all the time, even with all the makeup and glasses in the world. Can't you just use glitter to spice up the eyes? And get a huge, gorgeous tattoo somewhere else?|`|AA11950233	are you in the UK ? might be different there, but it is frowned upon in USA. normal people don't get facial tats. semi-normal people don't either.|`|O24FewSQaa	yes people would "frown upon you"<br>  teacher should not get facial tats.<br>  <br>  and wait for when your older with saggy skin and you have those awesome three little stars by your eyes - yeah thats reeeeeeeeallly coool.<br>  <br>  not.
ITJtxINpaa	You use them like an eyeshadow. Apply them with the brush on the eye lid.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	Either like an eyeshadow or use your finger and appy it lightly over your eyeshadow to give it a sparkle.|`|sTE0FUbtaa	What is the eye glitz? Could you post a link?
xXGn1zfsaa	Nooooo haha. I'm a 36C (sometimes a D, depending on the bra) and I can NOT comfortably fit in those bikinis! Most of them are string bikinis and slide around way too much for my liking.

AA10729271	yeah, it'll be sort of a dull washed out blond, but because you started out dark the bleach might only take your hair colour to a sort of darker brassy blond.<br>  <br>  Suggestion: just bleack a couple of streaks using the foil technique. (take a long strip of foil, and an inch sized section of hair from the sides of your head, not the crown, and then using a brush, brush the bleach onto the hair which is spread on the foil, and then fold foil over to cover, and then fold up and pin to head). When you're ready to do the purple, use the same brush to brush on the purple color to the streaks.|`|MMI8S60Vaa	Yes, it will. So I suggest not bleaching it unless you want blond hair.
1rHmtCdLaa	that happened to me when i streched my ears from 4 to 0 gaugeits most likely just your ears trying to heal themself or it could be the start of an infection so i suggest putting like neosporon on it or cleaning it with hydrogen peroxide and if its been a couple days since you streched then take your plugs/tapers out and clean them really good and put them back in good luck =D<br>  oh yeah and if the clear stuff turns yellow/green that means you have a definite infection and might want to go on antibiotics|`|bAYVSfdJaa	Depends what color the "gooy stuff" is.  If it's clearish, or whiteish, you're good.  If it's dark yellow or green, go to a doctor. Generally, it means that they're healing.  When they're doing this, you're going to want to wait for it to stop before you stretch them any larger. <br>  <br>  Also: A gauge is a unit of measurement, so you cannot "have gauges."  You can have your ears stretched to a 6g, though.<br>  <br>  Edit: Never use peroxide or any kind of antibacterial ointment on them.  If  they get infected, go to a doctor for antibiotics. And don't remove them - that will just trap an infection.|`|G6JXHvZKaa	yes it is the beginning of infection does it smell then for sure it is>|`|QtJH37KRaa	Its part of the healing process, use some peroxide on them, if it doesn't clear up in a few weeks go see the doc.|`|40dUfARwaa	nah, its just healing<br>  when the the discharge turns white or yellow/green then their infected
guxELB16aa	I have your exact same hair, and i got a pixie about 3 months back. And let me tell you that i LOVE IT! It has really caused my hair to straighten out alot more...I like that but if you want your hair to stay curly/wavy then watch it. I think you would look sooo cute with a pixie cut. & i'm not just saying that, i mean it. My pixie hits just below my ears and i have a deep part with side bangs crossed over to the left and its amazing. If you do decide to get your pixie done, then I recommend getting an ionic hair-dryer to blow your hair dry with. It dries hair fast and gives it a nice shine. And the best product is Fantasia IC Hair Polisher Olive Mosturizing Shine serum---it seriously makes my pixie glow : ) i get it at any drugstore for about 4 $ and its awesome! good luck with your desicions!<br>  <br>  GOOD LUCK<3<br>  -K-|`|mGvSEY6Saa	pictures would be helpful =/<br>  <br>  i'll come back and edit when you've put on pics k? :)|`|KU4UxCIHaa	It's hard to know without knowing what you're facial features look like.|`|kamZAhTwaa	not entirely sure without pics.. but go for it! hair will always grow back!<br>  <br>  unless you laser remove it :O<br>  <br>  xD

6tR0gS5kaa	go to a stand up tanning bed a few times this week and use a deep tingle lotion. Most salons carry single applications and the deep tingle results in a quicker, and deeper tan.  If your still not dark enough for your liking, apply a self tanner on Friday with bronzer in it :)|`|Ag0jb7Neaa	i think your only options are a tanning bed and those creams that have tanning qualities in them<br>  you can buy them at most stores now|`|IIpEaDCcaa	I sense some skin cancer coming on. Stay out of the sun!!<br>  <br>  Get a spray tan done professionally..|`|jKz63XCfaa	You can go to Wal-Mart and find a tanning lotion. Use it everyday until Friday as directed and you'll look tanner. The Wal-Mart brand does great for me.|`|8cVANnllaa	buy a self tanner.<br>  <br>  TIP: the more expensive they are, the better they are for your skin and the more REAL the tan looks!!!!!!!!|`|FcLMnWFpaa	I am the same way. You can buy spray tans at the drugstore or go to a tanning salon and get a spray tan there. Good luck:)|`|lWMmWjjtaa	well if its so easy go find the sunn.<br>  im sure it'll  be there :)|`|rGci1ehoaa	try a tanning bed... or use jergens natural glow... it works really good and has never turned my skin orange or anything.. i would suggest going tanning monday.... and using jergens natural glow.. then go tanning again on wednesday keep using jergens natural glow... and if you arent burnt and feel u can go tanning again on friday.. go for it but dont go for very long!!|`|CNZn1qhJaa	Well, even if you don't burn, you're skin is still becoming damaged. The more sun exposure you have, the higher your risk of getting skin cancer.<br>  <br>  Try a spray-on tan. Either do-it-yourself, or go to a Spray On tanning salon. It's the safest and quickest way.|`|TZWkf59Daa	jergens natural glow?<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=20090219162414AAnA6Ww&cp=24">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/?qid=2...</a><br>  please answer!<br>  we are looking for best answer!|`|dHr7Ks4eaa	there is a lotion that you rub on yourself and it makes you darker .it is a Macy's|`|X3QBqLSHaa	Get those tinted moisterizer things.|`|ZqXUduJMaa	Spray tan will be the easiest way to get a tan in a week.|`|qAYnWfY0aa	WELL YOU ARE UGLY...DEAL WITH IT!!!!!|`|xuvqrnOoaa	go to a tanning bed....... no brainer lol...or go to an exotic country ;)|`|pbYVtPP9aa	If you are willing to tan in a bed, I would suggest going tomorrow for 4 or 5 minutes. Then, evaluate how your skin took the tan. Are you feeling burnt anywhere? If it went well, I would move up to 8 minutes in the bed one or two more times. <br>  <br>  I would also suggest purchasing Jergens Natural Glow lotion tonight if possible and use it a couple times a day all over your body. It will either give you a pretty natural looking color or enhance your tanning bed tan. <br>  <br>  If you are not willing to go in the tanning bed for health reasons (as there is a risk of cancers), I would suggest a spray tan. Becoming more and more popular, spray tans are looking more natural and are being applied better. My friends often do a spray tan for special dates or events since it is quick and will last a few weeks.|`|E3Zqh0ZWaa	Well, the best and most natural way to tan is to spend time in the sun. with block of course. but, you probably cant go to a tropical island, so i would suggust a tanning salon. it really gets you tan, and evenly all over. just dont DONT over do it. its winter!!!!!!!!! everyones pale, so if ur super suer tan, ur gonna stand out, and not in a good way. Same goes for a spray on tan. thats a lot eiser, because you dont have to go any where, but i would get someone who has done it before to help you. there are three girls in my class who got a spry on tan. one was perfect! it looked really natural, but gave off this kinda glow, if u know what i meen. the second one had stripes of tan and paleness all along her face, legs, and arms. ooops. the last girl looks like a carrot. completely orange. wayyyyyyyyyyyyy too dark. not fitting to her skin tone either. looks horrible. so its fine if u get a tan, just be careful!|`|G19tKe43aa	Get a bottle of rum and drink it all down by sunset on the beach sleep it off and by morning i can guarantee  you will have the tan of your life|`|AA11559677	spray tan  It takes 15 minutes it is safe and even all over with no streaks|`|twLyttKJaa	i never tan either. Dont do it. <br>  <br>  You know what my sister's professor said.<br>  <br>  Before you enter a tanning both, smack you head on the wall 20 times. SKIN CANCER!!|`|y7ZSut7Kaa	Run really fast in one direction. You won't have to worry about being tan if you're dead. Just sayin'|`|lDq7u89Paa	if you reeeeeeeely need it try a spray on tan. but dont go to a tanning salon, it will looke fake and they are soo nasty|`|ghWyyXYXaa	go to the mall and see if they got a tanning store and get a tan|`|xZoTrrsnaa	Just get a spray on tan.|`|L7VE4Vfjaa	get some tan lotion stuff. you put it on and it makes you look tan|`|bcac27ced16b79c67d20a11e69e5eabcaa	do spray tan, save your body the uv rays|`|qbnrzyCZaa	Just go to the salon and get a spray on :l|`|frhF0X6aaa	spray tan|`|muOxoDGOaa	You could go get a spray on tan...they look pretty real.|`|yqXjJFipaa	thatz funny... idk
kJhZw0HYaa	You should put a lot of conditioner in your hair before you go to bed. Then wash a little out and bush you hair until there are not knots. Then put in a braids, because braids keep your hair from having knots. So now in the morning it will be soft, and easy to manage. Good luck!!! Hope I helped!!!|`|M5Sa85Ssaa	i get a shower in the morning and it makes it a lot easier to deal with|`|RacnhbxGaa	umm just like tie it up at night witn a satin scarf. or sleep on satin or silk pillow covers. or try to sleep on your stomach all night.
M5Sa85Ssaa	yeah it would look really pretty but if u really want to change it up dye it a light brown it would look nice with your complexion|`|lJqMqsocaa	definately|`|bT9SXnYQaa	I think it will look cute.|`|nkTKIXcBaa	Yes yes yes!<br>  Since your forehead is really high (no offense, mine is too), the bangs should work really well on you.<br>  The only thing I'd be concerned about is that having bangs sometimes makes your forehead more oily and prone to zits, so you'll need to take extra good care of your skin. <br>  You're going to look amaaaazing :)|`|I5ccK5Qfaa	Yes it would look so pretty.<br>  You have very pretty hair side bangs would be gorgeous dude.<br>  Peace|`|DVAhtK1raa	I think it would really make it look softer round your face. Get the front blended into the bang/fringe (im english) so its graduated from that into the length|`|P31Q8iHqaa	totally|`|1hS5vJW4aa	gurrrrl get some bangs!|`|lL1zNvzJaa	yeah you should.
0ed6c8c5f258d4d965096359b8f26fe4aa	well it looks pretty nice..<br>  some advice would maybe be to put up more detailed information about yourself just so that people dont feel so awkward giving you so much info about themselves when they know nothing about you|`|st5reHVjaa	it's too "do this" and "this is what this is" u know?<br>  like. i know what the home page is. so dont say that to take up space.<br>  it'd be nice if u could make it so people could post stuff that shows up on the site and others could give advice, as well as urself.<br>  <br>  <br>  return the favor?<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222151638AAtDCZJ&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|9DCjdnZ1aa	it looks nice :)<br>  what kind of things would you like to specialize in?<br>  <br>  well, to get people to ask you need to tell them.. :D<br>  <br>  <br>  it looks nice.. simple and easy to use|`|3rrmilhyaa	its fine|`|3ZsbMXLdaa	i sent you something on it :)
DVAhtK1raa	When you wash your hair use tepid/warm water, and dont rub to vigorously. This will stop your scalp from stimulating the sweat glands.<br>  Buy a lemon or citrus based shampoo and only condition it every other time if it is really short.<br>  If it is only really sweaty when you've been working out its because you loose most heat from your head, so it means your doing a good job.<br>  Hope this is helpful
hVKYVJ89aa	use any products that will dry it up|`|2diobki7aa	I have one like that right now too! :( Put a hot wash cloth on it, and keep it pushed on for at least 20 minutes. That brings down the swelling and redness. Also, wash your face 2 times a day and eat healthy to prevent breakouts. To make it disappear if you're going somewhere though, use a cover up. Cover Girl and Maybelline have some good ones. (: I hope this helps!

Ue56xZ7vaa	a diamond stud would look really cute on you.<br>  i have my nose pierced so i would know a few things..<br>  the pain isn't unbearable..to me it wasn't even a pain that hurt or pinched, it felt more like someone was squeezing their thumb and index finger on my nose really really hard. and it's over so quickly. some people say it hurts and it hurts really bad for a few days, even a week, but mine wasn't painful really at all, and i am one person that cannot take pain, and the nose piercing was nothing to me. [to be honest, piercing my EARS hurt more!] <br>  and for cleaning it to keep away infection i highly recommend H2O ocean spray. you can buy it at hot topic, spencers gifts, those little piercing keyosks in the mall or online. use it about 3 times a day, BUT using it too much can CAUSE an infection, so i wouldnt use it more than 4 or 5 times a day to be safe.<br>  <br>  any other questions? just email me i'll be glad to help you (:|`|pexxZB8Daa	its gonna look ugly and i heard it hurts pretty bad so i wouldnt do it!|`|rHCuyXcVaa	I'm not trying to be mean but it would look ugly on you if you really wont a percing get like a tounge or belly button ring i have both of them and they didnt hurt on me so yeah i wouldnt get the nose done<br>  <br>  {Haley}stunin like my daddy)Taken)
UYnZtJ2daa	There is no way to answer this...everyone has a different pain tolerance.<br>  Honestly, mine felt like a quick pinch when the needle went through and another when he put the jewelry through. After that, it never hurt again. Six weeks later and I've had no problems.<br>  <br>  But it probably won't be the same way for you. Everyone is different.|`|Jmi1rZeEaa	the actual piercing itself doesnt hurt, its the clamp they put on before that hurts.<br>  its not TOO bad, its just on a sensitive part of your nose. <br>  it just made my eyes water really bad and made me feel like i have to sneeze.<br>  it hurt but it wasnt unbearable.<br>  it definitely hurt more than a lip or ear or nose stud
1dEAWAUMaa	it really depends on your face shape, bone structure, how close your nose is to your mouth... lots of stuff.<br>  if you really want one, go for it !!<br>  if you have a smaller face, or your nose is very close to your mouth, i'd go for a smaller ring.<br>  look at pictures online, and see how the size of the jewelery looks with the different face shapes. see what works for you.<br>  a word to the wise though, if you take it out, and you get a cold, the hole can get very uncomfortable.|`|SCQphK96aa	i dont think anyone can pull them off<br>  <br>  they are one of the lowest grade piercings ever<br>  <br>  bulls wear them people shouldnt<br>  <br>  it always looks like there is sh!t hanging out of your nose and you need a tissue|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	i don't personally like them very much. they look good on certain people, but i think they look terrible on others.<br>  just my opinion.|`|EnAtAmHoaa	personally i wouldn't get one and think they're kinda gross. and trust me, i am totally pro piercing and don't think most any piercings are gross. but hey if you like them get one, it's your body and your right to decorate it any way you want|`|3KsFfj0Paa	HATE THEM<br>  especially when it's a ring.

AA10470911	Absolutely. 9 out of 10 department store products use a much higher grade of ingredients than brands like Maybelline and CoverGirl.<br>  <br>  It also depends on which products you are talking about. Skin care products are most definitely better in department stores, make up as well but for example, lip gloss, is pretty much lip gloss. Pick and choose items that are worth buying in a department store. Mascara you can pretty much buy anywhere.....foundation, definitely a department store. Eyeshadow you can buy anywhere. It really just depends.<br>  <br>  Most drugstore products use cheap ingredients and do not wear as well.|`|AZIe7uVJaa	wats the difference between a department store, and a drugstore?|`|D5aCSwsdaa	I believe the products in the department stores are more expensive than the drug store because they have a higher quality, but you can get stuff like the department store for less but the same quality at the drug store too
5GoXlTkQaa	My friend has a larger nose that she hates too and she just does her hair really nice so no one looks at her nose. My friends hair is probably like 2 inches past her shoulder and she curls it with a 1 1/2 barrel curling iron. <br>  I suggest just making something stand out more than your nose does. Like maybe you could do your eyes really pretty with makeup or do your hair really nice. Maybe you could even wear a crazy-cool accessories you like. <br>  I hope this helps you!!!|`|BILIAKSOaa	I have no idea, but I saw a question about someone's nose and how it looks a couple months ago. She said she pinched it for a couple months and in time her nose got noticeable smaller in her pictures. I know this isn't the answer, but whatever. haha(:
2HPa1ETUaa	Well, I've been able to hide mine so far. Had it for 7 days now.<br>  I only swelled right around my piercing, so it didn't affect the way I talked much at all. Don't have swelling anymore.<br>  And when I talk, you can't see it.<br>  So I think it's easy to hide. <br>  Also, having pink or clear balls help too. But I'm not sure if you can get it pierced with those. Usually you just get a metal/silver colored barbell and balls.<br>  Then you have to wait at least 3 weeks before you can change to a different barbell.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	they have retainers that you can put into them but wait until it is pretty healed or at least the swelling goes down and just put those in you really cant tell that you have it in|`|8x0oe23aaa	use a note pad and say i can't talk i lost my voice singing  at my school on the piece of paper.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	dont open your mouth alot when you talk. [ha that's from the movie thirteen, when tracy got her tongue pierced] anyways...and it swells for a few days or so. maybe a week, and unless you stick out your tongue alot or your dad looks in your mouth when you talk then it shouldn't be TOO noticeable. but you are 18, you can do whatever you want now. you're an adult, and if daddy dosen't approve BOO HOO. he'll get over it. to be honest, he'll probably notice it sometime or another, but the world won't stop spinning when he does.<br>  good luck. (:|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	In the first couple of years, this is hard to do (perhaps getting a retainer designed for another piercing type might help).  After the first few years, you can just take the jewellery out, and leave it out as long as you like (I often leave my barbell out for two weeks at a time).|`|OF7ZHq19aa	Just keep you mouth closed|`|1rHmtCdLaa	well the bar they put in when you first get it pierced is REALLY long so its kinda hard to hide and your tongue swells up so you sound funny when you try to talk but like they sell retainers to wear after your tongue heals but after you get it peirced you have to wait at least a month to change the bar good luck =D|`|EnAtAmHoaa	try crashing at a friend's house for the first few days, while your tongue is really swollen and you're talking funny. that way you don't have to see or talk to him. after that it will get easier, just don't open your mouth really wide and cover it when you yawn and **** like that. lol... i know where you're coming from though. they also sell retainers that are clear to wear on the job when you need to hide your piercing.|`|mUP35mo7aa	Well keep your mouth closed. If you cant do that tell your dad that you are 18, an adult now, and that you could decide stuff for yourself. If you tell him the truth i think he will understand.|`|gHT2ZPkFaa	You could put a clear retainer in the piercing.

uLtwGhTfaa	You have really pretty hair now* after a while it WILL fall off.Ironing you're hair= Burning you're hair. Think about it common sense. You should iron you're hair maybe a week in a month at most.|`|QcJOXHdvaa	not everybody has white people hair|`|OBuzcIDbaa	You're one of the lucky ones. Obviously you use good products and have beautiful, healthy, strong hair. Not everyone does. Be thankful! (:|`|2PDBxlYDaa	In the long run its not healthy for your hair. You are putting it through more wear and tear through a flat iron than you would blowing out, although blowing out your hair can damage it if you do it wrong as well. It helps to use a heat protectant product on your hair whether you flat iron or you blow it out.Also think about when you get older, you still want healthy hair in your 30s and 40s, many women's hair begins to thin and to sometimes fall out because of the abuse they put it in their teens and twenties.|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	i'm also 14 and i've been straightening my hair every day or 2 to 3 times a day since 3rd or 4th grade and my hair is not damaged at all! <br>  and i never even used heat protection spray until about a year ago.<br>  <br>  maybe your hair isn't damaged because it's really thick and naturally really healthy [it looks like that]. that's how mine is, that may be the reason it dosen't get damaged easily from straightening it.|`|dMv9y8MWaa	Wow, you do have really good hair. It's because of how hot the straightener is. It will make your hair frizzy and dead after a long time.|`|h00bqU7baa	Well our hair isnt as nice as yours that cuopurates with us. Count yourself as lucky.|`|wT6ZcHRyaa	People say that because for most people, when they straighten it everyday their hair gets dry from the extreme heat and it causes dead hair and split ends. Luckily for you, that doesn't happen. But if you started coloring your hair or damaging it any other way besides heat, your hair will most likely dry out and break at the ends. Or if you spend a lot of time out in the sun, that will probably do the trick as well.|`|383a6102747e8932f426bab71d94c72caa	They are saying that because eventually it will happen. You shouldn't put a lot of heat on your hair but you may be a rare case where your hair may not break off or have split ends. I would try to cut down on the flat-iron sessions to maybe once a day or once everyother day.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	damn! its super nice hair!  generally, heating tools are bad for your hair, but no one knows your hair like you do, so keep doing what you do.|`|qMRyYSAPaa	it wont damage it it will be fine my sister is a cosmotoligist and she straightens her hair every day lol just make Shure it isn't wet the damages it but your hair is fine hope i helped plzzz pick me for best answer  <3|`|NqTi3sOtaa	well you have healthy hair.

What is your secret because that is what happens to most everyone. What do you use for products? etc. :)|`|HpDPCPZVaa	ppl dp that to me too. but becasue we put heat on our hair it damages it. either making our hiar white.killing our hair. and whatevers.i have alot of split ends but remember to use heat protection every time... :D|`|LDOQK4Daaa	well is that like ur straightened hair or normal hair if normal i would say it looks awesome but maybe u should low down the times u straighten like maybe 3X a week and then use products to keep it super healthy

dd359cc64852ff6e00d407ac09db7261aa	Hey,<br>  <br>  OK, you're probably not looking your best, but definitely not gross. Behind a few blemishes you're very pretty.<br>  <br>  I think all you need to do is obviously wear a bit of foundation/concealer to cover up the blemishes. Then a thin line of eyeliner and some brown/black mascara. Some Vaseline/petroleum jelly for your lips and that's about it.<br>  <br>  You should get your eyebrows shaped at a salon too. You can take care of them yourself once you have a base shape done. They're just looking a bit messy at the moment.<br>  <br>  Obviously, I don't know what your hair looks like, but if you straighten it, then make sure you put volume into it. Because you have a round/heart-shaped face (that doesn't mean fat because it's not!) having straight hair plastered to your face would completely ruin your looks. Even better though, curl your hair.

qzkWahFeaa	I suggest Clean & Clear. Moisturizing face washes from them are great, and their acne cleanser work decently I believe.<br>  <br>  Powder can make it worse, since it goes into your pores sometimes.

8MHlZlwraa	<a href="http://www.polyvore.com/hair_studio_styles/thing?id=2044858" rel="nofollow">http://www.polyvore.com/hair_studio_styl...</a><br>  <br>  I think is it!!|`|nKruEEuhaa	Whoever told you the lower the number makes the hair brighter it misinformed. <br>  Developers are labeled in 10, 20, 30, and 40. <br>  10 volume is the weakest, usually just for depositing color, it can lift one level. <br>  20 volume can lift up to two levels <br>  30 volume can lift up to three levels <br>  and 40 can lift up to four .. get it? The higher the volume the stronger it is. So if you have dark hair and you are trying to color it a lighter color you will need a stronger volume developer. <br>  <br>  What color are you trying to get to? <br>  Creme vs liquid is all preference, if you like applying it with a bottle obviously you would use liquid, and creme with a bowl and brush. It depends on what you'd prefer to use, and what products you are using. <br>  <br>  I hope this helps!|`|5d9aed91e4e997510635a28e69f036acaa	Sounds like you are using a professional hair color and don't know what you are doing. You need to go to a salon and have someone fix your hair before you ruin it. The volume number has nothing to do with brightness. It has to do with levels of lift. Yes the numbers are important. Fixing the two tone look back to one color is hard to do. If you insist on doing it yourself, first only color the light a couple shades darker to match the top. Use the lower volume 10 developer to do this because you don't want to lift any color. You only want to open up the cuticle and deposit. Next step, condition. Then wait at least a month to color again. Forcing the cuticle open with developer drys and damages your hair. Do it too often and it will start breaking off or looking like a haystack. Good luck.

eQQWdk0uaa	They use a dark marker, usually blue or black ink to mark the spot they are going to pierce.  This might be the blue that came off your ear when you cleaned it.|`|383a6102747e8932f426bab71d94c72caa	Tha's interesting. I use to pierce ears at Claire's and never heard of this. It's possible you are allergic to gold and if that's not the case the earrings aren't gold. Try cleaning around the earrings, front and back with an antiseptic like the Band /Aid brand in the blue bottle (Ithink), or Bactine. If you see no change in a few days talk to your doctor or take them out let them heal ( the piercing will heal really fast) and go to another place more credible.|`|Oq6DQslJaa	1 they mark the spot where they are going to pierce your ear with a black marker.<br>  #2 It could be blood<br>  #3 Sometimes with cheep earings the metal rubs off and and makes your ear look green/black. (This mostly sounds like what happened)<br>  Hope I helped :)|`|eEznnpnVaa	A combination of things. You're probably bleeding [which causes dark scabs around the holes]. Also, as someone else mentioned, they use that ink or a pen to mark the ear, so it may be residue from that. Your mom also has a point--the earrings may merely be gold plated [IF that] and the plating may be turning your skin that color. <br>  <br>  Your best bet with ALL piercings is to get it done at a parlor with SURGICAL STEEL jewelry.|`|1xwyCxdUaa	It's most likely an allergy to the metal.<br>  <br>  Also, some metals deteriorate when they come in contact with the oils on our skin.  The color might just be rubbing off of the post.

K1cP3x4jaa	After you get out of the shower blow dry your hair straight with a round brush (your hair will be poofy, i have curly hair too and it is impossible to blow dry straight) make sure that it is still a little damp but mostly dry. Take sections of your hair and put them into rollers, huge giant rollers.. add hair spray before you roll for hold and volume. , not too much. Then you can blow dry your hair in the rollers or let air dry (that will take a while). When your hair is totally dry take out of rollers, run your fingers through a few times then use a curling iron to add definition on a few sections if needed.<br>  <br>  I hope that helps :)|`|GE0Qb3iwaa	vwey hard to do<br>  u should ask in a beauty salon|`|kMyERo6uaa	you should get this professionaly donee!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222091557AA1wsb2">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a><br>  answer mines?
vNBYAIZLaa	everyone's thighs are thicker at the top than the rest of your legs don't worry.|`|vWOuX1d5aa	AHHH!! i have the same exact problem. <br>  <br>  im 14 and weight 1OO pounds, i have very tall skinny legs, but my thighs are the top are pretty big, they have a gap between, but it not like skinny thin that i want. I Don't Know what to do.<br>  <br>  Here i found this online :<br>  <br>  1. Chair squat<br>  <br>  Squats is known the most beneficial and successful exercise for thighs, buttocks and claves. There are different types of squats like chair squat, dumbbell squat etc. Chair squat can be performed by standing in front of the chair with your back towards the chair. Now slowly sit down the chair and stand up again. Keep in mind that your legs should not be completely extended.<br>  <br>  2. Dumbbell squat<br>  <br>  Dumbbell squat is difficult than chair squat. Holding the dumbbells in your hands, your arm should be relaxed and straight. Now lower your body and don't stand straight until your thighs correspond to floor.<br>  <br>  3. Power walking<br>  <br>  Power walking is the easiest of all thinner things exercises. The simple method is to walk faster than normal with every step a strong step. Don't concentrate on speed in power walking and try to develop longer strides. You should take this exercise 3 to 4 days in a week and not less than 30 minutes.<br>  <br>  4. Stationary bike<br>  <br>  First configure the stationary bike and be sure to set up the seat in such a way that when you extend your leg to the bottom of pedal stroke, your knee should be a little bended. You should do this exercise 30 minutes every day and not more than 4 days in a week.<br>  <br>  5. Leg Press<br>  <br>  You must have a leg press machine at home or you have to go to gym to accomplish this exercise. Your movement should be slow, flexible and legs extended completely.<br>  <br>  6. Fitness band standing leg adduction<br>  <br>  Attach fitness band to a door and to the left ankle to start this exercise. You have to contract the inner thighs with the help of a chair and putting weight over your right leg. Repeat the exercise for both legs and with 20 repetitions to obtain thinner thighs.<br>  <br>  You may not find all the exercises very easy. Nevertheless, if you really want to have thin thighs, it will not be a difficult task for you keeping in view the accomplishment of your dream.|`|hTre6eYNaa	be happy how you are now and don't worry about it.

4ta8Kqvraa	i think 4 a tot full bangs are really cute and if her hair is always in her face maybie get it cut short, I dont think side bangs are really good 4 a tot, look at celebritys babys, like Suri, her hair is so cute how its a short bob and with bangs. also try some simple hair styles, like a half back, and cute pigtails!! hope that helped|`|AA11262499	full bangs across above her eyebrow. with short hair a little longer past the ears. thats how myn was when i was little. adorable and easy 2 do.|`|M5Sa85Ssaa	when i was little i had bangs that went straight across, and it looked really cute
JG7Dlnm3aa	well, ya know cutting your hair makes it grow faster, right? it stops all the dead ends from ruining the entire strand of hair. but idk, you could like try some men's hair growth stuff, i've always wondered what that would do.... hehe.... but maybe you can just do a cute little updo for the dance?
5YfHdPpyaa	Honestly i dont see anything wrong with your hair its pretty and its already short so cutting it wouldnt be a good idea i dont think it would look too good cut i say keep it trimmed and grow it out about 3 more inches or so get a little bit more layers and there you go. but i do love your bangs mine are pretty close to them.|`|s57OCEVraa	ok, so do something like what you have but grow it out longer and have long flowing curls. it would look great on you, good luck!

H6ixrUYLaa	You can always take your makeup off before you go running and put on sun screen.<br>  Or you can get a foundation with sun screen in it.<br>  <br>  But honestly, you're running and you're going to get sweaty and stuff, so putting on sunscreen over your foundation should not be that big of a deal.  If you did it during the school day, it might get cakey and oily looking, but sweat makes makeup look like that anyway, so I'd say go for it.|`|H2tkkWyPaa	I would wear something with sunscreen already in it.|`|GnT2CnhBaa	you should put sunscreen on BEFORE applying any make up. you can get face creams that are for all types of skin, if you have problem skin etc. <br>  i would say apply sunscreen before moisteriser maybe. or you could just use the sunscreen as a moisteriser. saves putting to much product on your face.|`|sTE0FUbtaa	Try doing a moisturizer first that has sun protection (Olay SPF 15 Moisturizer) and then doing a powder over that that also has sun protection (Bare Minerals SPF 15 Powder Foundation)|`|8a9682bf1891671d721fc25d6e7326a5aa	You should ALWAYS put on the lotion/sunblock beneath foundation/powder.  You should try maybe a cream tinted foundation with sunblock.  That sounds best for you.|`|tIPiGkKtaa	it sounds like that would mess up your powder try one with sunscreen already in it like bare minerals.|`|FF3owv2kaa	Well, i wouldn't really use a powder unless it's really necessary because its really not good for your skin... and if you do need it, i would try to get the sunscreen on before you put the powder on..or i would get a cover up that has the sunscreen in it already...<br>  <br>  I hope that helped:)|`|3rrmilhyaa	put the sunscreen on first then wait for it to dry then put on your powder.

The ones that say 'Moist' and 'Hair Insurance' might work for you. But I use 'Sydney Smooth' and the result was so great. :) <br>  -Pantene is a very effective brand too, to me. 'Moisture Renewal' should do the job for you. I'm not sure about the new lines that they have. Maybe they are good too. ;D <br>  -Herbal Essences works like magic for me. 'Break's Over', 'Hello Hydration' or 'Hydralicious Reconditioning' (the new purple one) might be the ones for you if you like that brand. The Hydralicious line is newer, and I think it works just as well. ^-^|`|8x0oe23aaa	Pantene it keeps your hair strong and healthy get the shampoo,conditioner ,and the moisturizer.and doesn't make your hair get dead ends so fast.|`|3U0q9AXxaa	head & shoulders <br>  silky and smooth<br>  or whatever<br>  the pink one<br>  haha<br>  its not specifically for dandruff<br>  it prevents it<br>  and smells amazing <br>  :)|`|03462132478c1103288b5a2f29610c7eaa	Try using a moisturizer shampoo like Nexxus/Therapy, alternating with citrus acid shampoo,again Nexxus/Assure).

I think that maybe the original pants were more like leather leggings. They tied onto the legs and around the waist with strings. Whatever they were like, I think the first pants were two separate leg coverings, not attached together, thus a pair of pants. Although I don't think the original word would have been pants.<br>  <br>  That's just my guess.|`|vYyIpxo9aa	i don't know<br>  might be because we have two legs? <br>  good question, i've never thought of that|`|i7WVSXnWaa	i think maybe our pair of legs are consider as one whole...<br>  <br>  because, we can't wear a jeans or shoes that we can only wear on the <br>  <br>  left or right side only...<br>  <br>  we can use them if they don't have pair :D

iy2Vcgfmaa	I like the first dress|`|PK9R1V8gaa	they seem more for the beach than prom, but if i had to chose i'd say the first one is the cutest, but the second one would probably look better on you because of the flowy colors.|`|AX13vUJeaa	The first one is gorgouse!<br>  But I wouldd't wear it to the prom though...

The only problem I've had thus far is accidentally pulling it half way out [PAINFUL!!!], either in the shower when I'm washing my face [by accidentally rubbing the wash cloth over it] or from my dogs accidentally pawing at it. <br>  <br>  L rings are great in that you know they're not going anywhere, but they're very difficult to take out. I would definitely suggest a nose screw rather than a nose bone or L ring.|`|3eCTdQ08aa	I didn't have any problems with mine, except for when you wash or dry you're face, be careful not to catch a towel on it if you have a stud in, it does hurt. haha.<br>  <br>  and when you get it pierced, the place should have both nose studs and hoops, and you can choose what you want. If i remember correctly, the hoops were about five dollars cheaper than the studs where i went, but i chose a stud because it seemed like it would be easier to clean and such, but you get to choose what type of jewelry you want.|`|IHw2qUtcaa	I had a L shaped stud put in it.

QezKyRJqaa	First off all, BE CAREFUL! There are lots of people that will try to rip you off! So, NEVER pay to join a model agency, real agencies do not charge, but some fakes do! <br>  <br>  Also at your age, ALWAYS take someone with you (whos over 18) when you go to model agencies or to photoshoots, so you're not pressured into posing for pics you're not comfertable with.<br>  <br>  Sorry, I'm not trying to put you off, but you've got to be careful there are, some people out there who are like that. <br>  <br>  Look for the big agencies that people recommend, ask good photogrpahers or established models if you can!<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|0ed6c8c5f258d4d965096359b8f26fe4aa	Start by finding an agency in your area. You will have to book an appointment with them and they will tell you what kind of modelling you can do and if you are elligible for anything.<br>  Once they accept you as being a model and you sign up for a contract with them everything starts.. pics, portfolio, go-sees ect.<br>  <br>  Goodluck!|`|NlKQbhvUaa	well start with commercials. im in a book that companies look through to see if they want to use me in a commercial. find where ever ur local commercial station is and get hooked up!|`|ZiTIghRLaa	First you buy some clay and then you shape it into...

eQQWdk0uaa	Everyone tans differently.  Some will be beach dark by then and some (like me) will be slightly tanned.  Just lay when you can and it will be the best you can do.  You can also use a bronzer which will give you a darker look.  It wears off in a few days so I wouldn't bother using it until the week of your prom.  I'm sure you'll look great!   Good luck!|`|PK9R1V8gaa	you'll proably have a sunkissed, slight tanned glow, like you would get after the first month of summer.|`|87CYXPnRaa	It depends on how well their tanning solution works.  And I wouldn't go every day.  If it has worked fo ryou previously or others previously then odds are they will work for your prom.|`|cl2hc50Baa	One thing you should keep in mind is that you NEVER go to a tanning salon.  You are 55 percent more likely to develop malignant melanoma by tanning in a tanning bed.<br>  <br>  Instead, go lay a towel out in your backyard and do it naturally every other day for about a half hour.  You should get a nice glow by the time of your prom.|`|V2v66A7Waa	dont go to a tanning salon its fries up your skin so you would get skin cancer. Lay down in your backyard/patio and drink some ice tea and relax. But dont stay out too long! You might get a sun burn ouch... also you could also use spray tans (:|`|68AApO3laa	if you realy want to be tanned go 2 times a week for 10 mins or 15 min until you like your tan and also depending on how fast you tan and before your prom go 3 days before just to touch up <br>  but dont fry your skin coz it will hurt,
gdGDvWTDaa	no<br>  bc its the first impression<br>  if ur really nervous and too shy and studder she'd say no|`|24cUKZDgaa	some girls just arn't into getting picked up by random guys like that.|`|AA12365169	No it means that you're scared i guess.|`|8x0oe23aaa	no your just really really shy.take girl lessons with your dad.|`|DhPMkORnaa	People reject other people for a variety of reasons, and lack of physical attraction isn't always the case. Already being taken, a recent break up, commitment issues, or strong feelings for another person are all possibilities as to why rejection occurs. Or, it could be the person just doesn't think you're their type. Who knows. But just because some girl turns you down does NOT mean you're ugly. Don't ever think that.|`|hWqYrIW3aa	If they reject you, it doesn't mean your Ugly, maybe there already taken, or your just not there type, or there gay.<br>  Start off by catching her eye, and smiling, at her and keep that up for a few days, maybe even saying hi now and then, and then after a while start a conversation by...i dunno, saying "You look really nice today"...etc, just none of those cheesy chat-up lines.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I think it's creepy when random guys come up and talk to me no matter how cute they are. So just because a girl isn't interested doesn't mean your ugly.. it might just mean she thinks you're a freak. Hope that helps.|`|dWdoy5e4aa	it could mean your ugly or it could not. if a random guy just went up to me in walmart i would be a little freaked out.|`|sHqexFWQaa	it depends...  if your ugly your ugly and thats it it.|`|i6RZ7lUraa	no|`|OMPSzNUdaa	sike! you should go for it, the only way to find out is to do it. [:|`|E6dYd2Ulaa	you are just scared i bet ur not even ugly|`|9z0CpCR9aa	why dnt you barge into her and apoligize and then start a conversation?<br>  idk if your ugly then you are, we cudnt possible tell by what you've written, we'd need a picture to judge tht?|`|dHeMxnp2aa	depends on the girls taste in guys. and dont just walk up to her and say HI!

eN5xA6RKaa	its probably closed up, but you can just try to get it in without hurting yourself..just take the bar and push alittle on the hole, if it wont go in, its closed. mine closed a week after i took mine out..but you had yours pierced for a really long time, so it might have stayed open longer.|`|KdQiHnebaa	First off congrats on your baby! lol. What I would do is to go back to where you got your bellybutton pierced and just ask them what they think. They would put it in or you could do it yourself. Hope this helps! Good Luck!

RIjjibnwaa	I have herstyler curlers & they are amazing. Thry make your hair really shiny & the curls stay in for ages. They give lovely curls, you can get smaller tongs for tight wringlet type curls or bigger tongs for angel like curls. I recommend them & they are definetly worth the money. (:<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.herstyler.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.herstyler.com/</a><br>  <br>  p.s I have the grande baby curl ones, I would recommend these more as the smaller ones do really tight small curls more for wee girls etc.|`|L14wPCR2aa	one and a half inch is good.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	my flat iron, no joke, is AMAZING at curling my hair.  its a 1" solia.|`|qNJEiuvvaa	1/2 or 3/4 cuz anything bigger then that just gives your hair volume, or wavy-ness not curly
afB6WFRzaa	Sorry to say but the blow drying, curling iron and tons of hairspray all contribute to dry, straw like hair. Taking some medications can dry your hair out, cause different growth patterns, ETC. It all depends on the type of medicine. To get your hair back to normal, I would suggest laying low on the heat; or at LEAST put some sort of protector in your hair before all the heat styling. What type of shampoo and conditioner are your using? Are you ready to spend a little more on your hair to nurse it back to health? Professional products really help, its all about choice. I would recommend Paul Mitchell's Instant Moisture Shamp and Cond. A weekly deep conditioner is great, but you gotta leave it in your hair preferably with a cap to keep heat on your hair. Read the ingredients on your products, too much alcohol sounds like the culprit, but I can't say considering I can't feel or see your hair :D Good Luck|`|ZkFhg69naa	STOP using all the products because that dries your hair out! i suggest:<br>  - using one shampoo or conditioner specialized in hydrating hair and repairing it such as:<a href="http://pantene.com/en-US/product/nf_mb_shampoo.jspx" rel="nofollow">http://pantene.com/en-US/product/nf_mb_s...</a><br>  <br>  - If you are going to use a product, use ONE that can help renew your hair such as this: <a href="http://pantene.com/en-US/product/relaxedandnatural_dailyoilcreammoisturizing.jspx" rel="nofollow">http://pantene.com/en-US/product/relaxed...</a><br>  <br>  -I would suggest stop getting highlights and blow drying because that makes it worse. <br>  <br>  - if you have to blow dry for day time, use warm or cool temperature and let it air-dry partly before you start. If you usually stay at home on the weekend or something, don't blow dry your hair since its unnecessary.  volume can be enhanced by using mouse like this:  <a href="http://www.pantene.com/en-US/product/fullandthick_extrafullmoussemaxhold.jspx#reviews" rel="nofollow">http://www.pantene.com/en-US/product/ful...</a><br>  <br>  **If your hair is severely dry, then go to your hair salon to get it checked out professionally for tips and products.|`|f2711d8349aeed648c50f146c4496e35aa	All the things you need to fix:<br>  1. excessive hair spray<br>  2.Blow drying<br>  3.professionally highlighted can still cause damage even if it's in a hair salon.<br>  4.cut your split ends. It will not make your grow faster, but it will make it look less frizzy and dry. <br>  <br>  Good Luck!!|`|Rf2r23sYaa	It sounds like you're doing everything wrong (except for the conditioning). If you bleach your hair, and use a blow dryer, and use a curling iron, and use hair spray (which has tons of drying alcohol in it) then you are going to have dry hair. You're probably just going to have to grow it until you can cut off the damage.|`|2diobki7aa	Health problems could cause this. What problems are they, if you don't mind my asking? Stop conditioning so much, and shampoo every other day with Biolage. You can buy it at salons. Try Nexxus for deep conditioning ONCE A WEEK only! Don't do the hot oil treatments, highlighting, or curling iron anymore. If you must use the curling iron, use a heat protection spray from a salon. Or Sunsilk works well. (: The hair spray and blow dryer shouldn't hurt it, but before blow drying, use the protection spray. GOOD LUCK!

BqQiqUfLaa	oh dear probably 10 at the most. work out for at least 1 hour, then maybe you'll get to 13<br>  PS if you get hungry eat celery. really, it's like 5 calories. and nobody will tell you to eat bcz you ARE<br>  and please remember, ITS HARD|`|hWqYrIW3aa	the first few days you start the fast you loose water weight (around 1-3 days into the fast) its only afterwards that your body starts burning fat.<br>  After that you should be loosing around a 1/2 a lb -1lb a day.<br>  The running might be a bit too extreme as you are not eating anything, and you could end up with really bad cramps as there is no starch to turn into gluclose for respiration to take place.<br>  Combine it with Starjumps, Streaches, Weightlifting, Situps...etc, anything to get your heart pumping.<br>  Swimming is the best, i lost 1lb by doing it for around 2-3 hours.<br>  And also, when the fast is finished, you cant go back to eating junk, boost your calorie intake little by little, as the matebolism change could make you gain more weight then before, so start of by eating fruits +veg, and then slowly increase it to 200 a day until your eating around 1500 - 1700 a day, depending on how much you eat now.|`|mq21qSmAaa	You will lose weight.  And then gain it all back again, plus some.<br>  <br>  You have to know how your body works.  In this case, your metabolism will slow way down to try and savor the last bits of food it got.  The slower your metabolism, the harder it will be for you to lose weight and the easier it will be to gain it.  For a healthy quick metabolism, you should eat a few small meals every few hours.  This means your metabolism will always have something to do and a working metabolism burns calories.<br>  <br>  Running is great!  It helps you all over - your metabolism, take on life, and just, well, everything!  Exercising is one of the best things you can do for yourself.<br>  <br>  Do it the healthy way - it'll last longer|`|nYUEGFrvaa	i would say that you'll lose about 5-8lbs in 5 days<br>  it'll about 2-3lbs will be water weight<br>  you'll have crazy hunger pangs on day 2-3 <br>  exercise or drinking a lot of water.should help or tums<br>  good luck<br>  but prepare and know that you'll gain about half of it back in a week or so<br>  so continue to exercise and eat healthily|`|evTvNoF6aa	I'm guessing you realize that this is extremely unhealthy to only have water for five days. At least take vitamins and drink juices, to ensure your body is getting its needed nutrition.<br>  <br>  How much you'll lose depends totally on your body, no one will be able to give you an accurate estimate.|`|qgDCcNQqaa	Do you want to die. <br>  :|<br>  No food for 5 days. Just water and jogging?<br>  That's crazy unhealthy. Idc if you say not to comment on how unhealthy it is. You won't lose 13lbs from it anyway. Why don't you lose weight the normal HEALTHY way. 1-2lbs a week.  By changing your diet and excerise daily. Safely.|`|3E7EHc8faa	You can't go more than 3 days without water. You will become seriously dehydrated and can result in death.|`|NlKQbhvUaa	losing weight is not a top priority. stop the water fast and stop eating junk food!  no water=no losing weight|`|qWIha03Iaa	Honestly, I don't think you will die from fasting for 5 days. I personally have gone 3 days without eating or drinking anything and it only caused me to feel sick, dizzy and I had a rapid heart beat. However, after I was fine and didn't need to seek medical attention. But I am quite sure that this method of yours is unhealthy and stupid. And actually, fasting can also cause you to gain weight, rather than loose it. Your body needs food to function properly throughout the day.<br>  <br>  I don't advise you to take this method since there are more effective and healthier ways of going about losing weight, such as the age old truth of a healthy diet and exercise.<br>   <br>  To answer your question, I don't believe you will be able to lose 13lbs in 5 days. Maybe 5lbs max. And from fasting experience, it does not work. You will put the weight back on, no doubt. Running will help but only as long as you step up your regiment and increasing your running time and pushing yourself. <br>  <br>  Good luck to you, but be healthy! :)|`|hkTwclOsaa	I will pay for your funeral|`|2V87n4PKaa	why cant you just cut out junk food and go to the gym instead of trying to kill yourself?<br>  <br>  if you run that much everyday and not drink any water, you WILL pass out.<br>  my sister once went a day without water, went to karate, and she passed  out and ended up in the hospital|`|aa35e095a615d2c9fa9251d229a3968aaa	You might  lose 13lbs, but you also might end up in hospital. Also you will only be losing water, not fat, so you will put it straight back on afterwards.|`|jtjISk6qaa	are you trying to kill yourself???! how old are you?<br>  <br>  go to the gym and get personal training sessions. eat healthier...etc.|`|MbFS6XFQaa	oh gosh...my kidneys hurt just thinking about that
118ff9df8e3dbc575619cb9fd97e296eaa	No, just go to a salon and have professional do it for you besides, I think it will only cost you $5.|`|3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	If you have cut your own bangs before successfully, or if you know how to properly cut hair, then go for it, and cut your own bangs. However, if you have never cut hair before, you have to remember that every person's hair is a different texture and consistency and that the results are different on every individual. It's best to leave cutting your hair to a professional. Just get a quick trim, they can trim off the bottom tips of your hair as well to help it grow faster, healthier, and prevent split ends. <br>  <br>  Don't cut your own hair, you will regret it. Everyone I know who has ever taken a pair of scissors to their own hair has regretted it later on (if not right away, but down the road). Also, if you cut your bangs and mess them up really bad, sometimes you will have to go to an expert after the fact, and if you did too much irreversible damage, you could be stuck with a very bad hair cut until it has a chance to grow back.|`|X2iBXyVsaa	I cut my bangs.  I like doing them myself because I can take my time, and I get what I want!  At a hair cutting place, I usually don't get the desired effect.<br>  <br>  Just be careful and good luck :)<br>  <br>  ETA:  Also, please don't wet your bangs to cut them!!!!!!  When your bangs are wet, you can't tell how short they are and you could accidently cut them too short.|`|AA11318212	No. No. No. No.<br>  You will regret it after.|`|LiXyrQ9waa	no. everyones hair is different.|`|dzJR8Dwvaa	it depends.<br>  i cut mine myself and they came out good.<br>  just be sure you're doing it the right length and what not.|`|YsltSuf2aa	It depends.<br>  How skilled are you when working with hair?<br>  It's best you let a professional do it, watch what they do so you can learn.|`|sJZXhPxyaa	yeah, that's what i did, just make sure you start by cutting them a little too long.  If they happen to look bad they'll be easy to hide, and bangs that are too short look tacky.|`|baMhIOQZaa	no, my sister did mine and it was slanted and we used a vid.<br>  <br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090222101821AANpWhc&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|r3EKIQH8aa	I've cut my own bangs before and it did not turn out well i would highly recomend getting them cut at a salon.

R7q9BLuBaa	The socks are not slutty at all, your outfit is what makes all the difference and not the socks. you have to be careful and decide what to wear with them because they can easily look cute or slutty. try flats first, if you wear heels you run the danger of looking something you don't want. you should expose a bit of skin in the thighs with a skirt. If you wear shorts you can get away with it more easily. try a few outfits and see what comforts you. also see what everyone else is wearing. let me know if you need any aditional info.|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I think it's little too naughty school girl looking which is way overdone so I wouldn't wear them, even though they are cute!|`|IgEYfBPJaa	i think it depends how you wud wear them, if with a short skirt or really short shorts then yes they possibly would look slutty but if you wore them right they could look nice :)|`|PYdWer6taa	They look fine to me. You might want to rethink your outfit though- all that black can look cliche and dated.|`|lzbEEg5Daa	Nooo way! XD<br>  I love them!

Ive worn them with a dolly dress and flats and it looked really cute! But i also know how to "sl ut them up" lol with heels, skirt and a fitted shirt. Also its all about how you carry yourself. But what you desrcribed sounds fine, not really slutty unless youre showing alot of thigh and got ya boobs out! xx|`|DOjztYLHaa	they would be if you wore like super short shorts and a revealing top, but anything could be slutty like that. the way you are going to wear it sounds adorable! id wear it!! :]|`|rr5uUk6jaa	Ofc not. It depends on the rest of the outfit and not only that but how it is worn. I'm sure anything could be MADE slutty but not normal clothes|`|JmdnlQsHaa	depends.  if youve got a good eye for what clothes look good together they can look fine and not at all slutty

b165361aa3bdfd3dd4401459ad6b7836aa	As a man you shave your face very frequently.  Your face has developed somewhat of a callous to the shaving so it is not as sensitive as the skin you do not shave as frequently.<br>  <br>  Use lots of soap/body wash or even shaving cream when saving your body.  Shave after you have stood in the shower and washed your whole body.  This gives the hair and skin time to soften. It is better to shave at night. If you are still worried about razor burn then apply lotion or baby powder.|`|ae7ba67b80a455111c78edb15b0b5723aa	your skin is more sensitive else where than on your face.

EzLP6Jahaa	EYES- Wear a blue, green, or turquiose colored eye shadow blended with white. <br>  <br>  LIPS - Since you have 'kinda big' lips, just wear a nude shade of lipstick with a light pink shade of shimmery lip gloss.<br>  <br>  CHEEKS- Just a little blush. <br>  <br>  EYE LASHES- Since their already long, I recommend buying a black mascara, that volumizes your lashes.

They will be able to have a "makeup artist" or a "makeup expert" help you decide what makeup is right for you. They can help you decide what shades to wear on your face, and what look is the best for each time of day. There are some makeup stores that will also do free consultations and makeup as well. It's always best to consult an expert so that you learn how to apply makeup properly, how to tell if makeup is expired, learn makeup safety (like never to share mascara or lipstick), as well as learn how much makeup is appropriate to use. Sephora is one store that I know gives free consultations, but I know that there are many others that do as well. Your best bet is to check out your local mall, and see who offers free makeovers and/or free consultations. If you have sensitive skin, you may wish to consult a skin care expert so that you do not wear makeup products that will cause you to have any type of adverse reaction. <br>  <br>  Online, there are some free makeover tools that can help you decide which products are right for you:<br>  <a href="http://www.marykay.com/whatsnew/virtualmakeover/default.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.marykay.com/whatsnew/virtualm...</a><br>  <br>  Some sites, will even allow you to upload a picture of yourself so that you can decide what shades look best on you.

All liquid makeup will clog your skin.This is because of the parafins, waxes, oils etc.. added to a "liquid" makeup to keep it not only unseparated but to prolong shelf life and congealing. In essence you are covering your pores and not allowing them to breathe and trust me your skin is your largest organ and needs plenty of breathing room. <br>  <br>  Now all that said I would recommend you use the Mineralogie makeup line and by the way if you can't find it, we carry in our office. All the mineral makeup companies 10 years ago were under one company called color science. Then you had all these people make there own version (i.e. bare essentials crap etc...) and the orginal company changed theie naem to Mineralogie. This does not contain high talc like other which makes your subaceous glands/oil glads. go into over drive and produce sebum / oil. Mineralogie gives you full mineral sun protection which is different then chemically based sublocks in that chemical ones absorbs UV, do damage to the underlying dermis but you dont burn so the aging is accelerated and you see the results later. Mineral sublock however acts like a mirror and blocks all UVA (longest wavelength and causes damage to underlying tissue for long term damage, UVB (would burn what you can see- your epedermis), and  UVC (atmospheric radiation). Email with any questions you may have. Have a good day. <br>  <br>  Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Double Face Perefector would be a good concealer for under eyes and blemishes. Probably in medium or light.<br>  <br>  On your eyes, sweep a golden light shimmery color or nude all over the lid. The preferably pink blush for the apple of your cheek can also be swept across the outside of the lid. For more "smokey" eyes then add dark chocolate brown to the outside corner and crease of the eye and lightly blend into the pink. Finish with black liner and loreal voluminous mascara in black noir. pink gloss (no liner on full lips!!!) to finish and walla oscar ready. email with any questions you may have.

7jpaOKu2aa	omg dude you should totally go to bath and body works and get their lotion called warm vanilla sugar it makes ur skin so freakin soft i always get comlements when i use it really and its not that expensive for somethin that works so good and smells good|`|SLbrSRkGaa	Try Aveeno lotion - Oatmeal base - good scent.|`|27zNiXZaaa	cetaphil
a70c9a738ebec9de6530aaa2660bccfbaa	If you have 2 days to spare, toothpaste does the trick. About an hour before you go to sleep, dab it on the zit. Let it dry and go to sleep. The next day it will be noticeably smaller and within 2 days it will be almost gone. The toothpaste sterilizes the area. <br>  Another thing I use this:<br>  <a href="http://www.neutrogena.com/econsumer/ntg/teenproductdetail.view?productId=181&catId=1&subCatId=1" rel="nofollow">http://www.neutrogena.com/econsumer/ntg/...</a><br>  I dab it on the spot like the toothpaste. Do not use the toothpaste and the neutrogena together! It is too strong. I suggest just using toothpaste tonight and seeing if there is a difference tomorrow morning.|`|UwGCA9ZTaa	the best thing to do is leave it.<br>  toothpaste sometimes reduces the redness, but the best thing for your skin is just to take off your make-up every night and use a good cleanser to remove excess oil.<br>  that does you the best in the long term.|`|QB1XWr8naa	try face wash|`|eWwNRKtiaa	try the skin naked line of face wash. its $13.95, and works really good.[ and it helps keep pimples away, even if you dont have them at the time.] <br>  toothpaste drys out the pimple, but it also drys out the skin around it, so it may make it look red, and burn.<br>  also, i like the clinique pimple creme. just a little dab.<br>  hope this helps!!!!<br>  -a|`|pdpJI3taaa	First you get some sea breeze (alchol made for your face)  then get a sewing needle  use the needle to pop it get a cotton ball and put sea breeze on it hold it on the popped zit  so it doesnt get infected and thats it

xgRgPkCiaa	I like most of your choices. Here is what i think personally. I like the long ones better than the shorter ones. I rated them 1-5 to make it easier to choose the perfect ones.<br>  1.... 3 I don't like how it puffs out. I like the straps.<br>  2.....2 The color is bad, and don't like the style.<br>  3.....2 Too plain<br>  4.....I like it but it is a little too short for me. Its really what you like for your style.<br>  <br>  5....4 I love the style, i like the color on that better than the other one because it is long.<br>  6....2 I don't like the blue flower.<br>  7....3 I like style, very elegant but i don't like it is a white.<br>  8....5 This one is my favorite is will look great with your brown hair, and the style will own, and the color is perfect. Not to light and not to plain, or dark.<br>  9....2 I don't like the color, or the flower on any of these.<br>  10..2 I like the green color. But No!<br>  11....2 I am not a big fan of pink with brown hair.<br>  12....3 Its a little to busy.<br>  13....2 Too simple, I don't like the pattern.<br>  14....5 I love this, the silver with the red.<br>  15....2 does not stand out.<br>  16....4 Nice, i like the personality.<br>  17... 3 I like the style but not the color. <br>  18... 2 It's to straight.<br>  19....3 I like that one, its not plain though.<br>  20....5 I love this one. <br>  <br>  I still like the long ones the best.The navy one. With your dark hair i would wear the darker colored ones.  My favorites are 8,14, and 20.<br>        I hope i helped. As you could see i like the longer ones way better. The 1st one was nice but the white. I would say if your more the the skinny type, then show it off with the long ones and the olive green one.

Twq7efhQaa	With the right hair cut you can pull this off.  as your hair is not long enough for some of the emo hairstyles there will be certain ones u can get.

Dont do that.

5FDdyYwcaa	It depends on what look you are going for. Cartilage piercings are perfectly appropriate in some circumstances (high school, some colleges) but not in others (job interviews, college interviews etc.) It's a very personal decision whether or not to pierce yourself because it is a semi-permanent thing.

And what I mean by that is SELF CONFIDENCE.. That is the key. You can be the hottest there is if you only remember those two words.. I promise!!
ggwBMdX8aa	aww its alright<br>  we all have those days when we dont feel pretty|`|rpPT4x5Baa	This sounds like a bunch of self-pitty to me.<br>  Would you like a freaking cookie?|`|D5CVoI7Yaa	m c .. put a picture up... and get rated... and ask for tips so u feel more comfortable with yourself... <br>  but getting a girl is not all about looks.. you have to be loving and caring... have a good personality and treat others well.. :0)<br>  <br>  *PICTURE*.... lol|`|o9KJNCLJaa	Well For one girls are very attracted to confidence and a lot of the times girls won't hit on you. You need to talk to them. Also a lot of the guys that have girls are girls that they know from school. You need to be yourself and think about what you say before you say something stupid. It might take some time to get comfortable with yourself and you really shouldn't trying changing right away.|`|7DJkwzKDaa	i bet your not that ugly :o<br>  not everyone is trying to be nice.<br>  honestly, i know a lot of attractive ppl who think they're ugly.<br>  i know how hard it is not to compare urself to others.<br>  but just try to look your best and feel your best!! :)|`|2404nDvSaa	get a make over...... ther wasn't really a question so i made one up!|`|HtHFHfDKaa	You have to quit being so shy some girls like the shy type but you are never going to get a date if you can't get the courage to ask someone out. Girls like it when the guys do the asking. You need to think more of yourself and so will other people. People just think of you as being pathetic when you don't even find your self attractive or try to ask a girl out, so then you end up being the loner at school. You always have to take that chance that a girl might reject you because other wise you may never find the right woman.<br>  What's more important asking someone out and getting your heart broken just to end up alone and miserable or asking someone out and maybe finding Mrs. Right. Or never asking anyone out and still end up alone and miserable.|`|lI7m7eO7aa	Looks aren't everything!<br>  sometime i compare myself to girls<br>  more attractive than me, but i dont sweat it.<br>  most girls like guys with personality anyway<br>  (well most of them)<br>  i've dated lots of guys based on <br>  their personality other than looks.<br>  when you see a girl you like, just smile at her<br>  .she'll probably get the hint you like her<br>  and if she's attracted to you , the'res no way you'll risk rejection|`|b8QM7NY6aa	you know mc when i asked a question about why men never listen your answer gave me the impression that you were a player you know those overconfident men we love to hate, seriously self pitty is unattractive, coz like i said last time it's what's in your heart that matters besides most cute hot guys are players and they might get the girls but they only end up being hated by them for breaking their hearts so just be yourself and remeber looks aren't everything ;) lol|`|xBUNpdgIaa	You're not the only person who feels like that! You have to be positive, when your in the mall or store, don't think about people who you think are more attractive, if you see someone you think is ugly try saying 'I'm more attractive than them'!! (Not out loud :P) Also, I love boys who dress well! Maybe you coudl get a cool haircut!!?|`|b3532db70f45af9e0861017ebadbea02aa	omg the same thing happens to me<br>  i have a really low self esteem!<br>  not enough confidence.<br>  people always tell me im pretty, but i dont like accepting if for some reason.<br>  im ALWAYS comparing myself to others.<br>  <br>  wow um but i went into modeling and i took self-confidence classes first.<br>  it really helps.<br>  you just have to make yourself feel pretty and stuff. <br>  hard to explain.|`|ijeninncaa	Aww you have to get back into the game! Be a little confident, I'm sure you're lovely. True love is when you fall in love with someone's personality.|`|37a6c8320b8d6c53cc6b5bc5f10c6e0faa	Awe its okay, Im sure your not ugly, people wouldnt say ur cute or hot to be nice, if u were ugly..to be nice they just wouldnt call u ugly|`|o0mwF5kFaa	Grow a spine.<br>  ==|`|BBK7i1A7aa	First of all, people would never say you're hot just to be nice. <br>  I think your problem is your lack of confidence. If you think you're ugly, other people will too, just because you give off a vibe of awkward self-consciousness. I mean, some girls like shy guys (I actually do), but most will be attracted to whoever seems confident and secure. And then, when these girls don't pay attention to you, you feel even uglier. So it's like a vicious circle.<br>  Just make sure you're taking care of yourself (getting rid of any acne, showering, wearing cologne). Then you'll feel better and will be able to project a feeling of self-confidence that will be attractive. <br>  But seriously, I HIGHLY doubt that you are ugly.|`|AA11277812	Well don't let it get to you, most girls get turned off even at the scent of  low self esteem, they like a guy with confidence. Well I'm thinking your young around 14 to 17, yea don't worry about it hopefully you will grow out of it. And just work with what you have guy, like make good money, or rely on your personality theres always something that can catch a girls attention, the trick is keeping them entertained after lol.|`|MOQprUmCaa	i doubt people would waste time telling you that you were cute if you were ugly..<br>  and your confidence being so shitty probably turns girls off<br>  it's one thing to be a little insecure, but don't tell everyone you hate yourself to make them feel sorry for you<br>  <br>  suck it up, bro|`|hp4hiA4Eaa	I like a guy who doesnt care about looks. If a girl likes you, she'll like you for your personality, not looks.<br>  I cant stand people who ONLY look at peoples looks and not at their actual personality.<br>  Find someone like that. :)|`|SgIKMRARaa	Ugly people always think there pretty So I bet you cute. I bet you'll get a girl.<br>  If you like yourself people will like you.<br>  good luck|`|inKdDBcZaa	What is this, your livejournal?|`|N3ROX08kaa	if you put a pic on ppl will tell u how they think u look..... u might be cute but just think ur ugly..........

For a 15/16 year old however, might depend on how toned.

lPCjNkEnaa	Conceal Breakouts<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Use a concealer specifically formulated both to cover and to treat blemishes. You want something drier than an under eye concealer, which is usually quite creamy. A treatment concealer or an oil-free stick foundation will stay on the trouble spot without migrating.<br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Whether you use your finger or a concealer brush, the key is concentrating the pigment right on the pimple. Gently tap the product onto the blemish, if you wipe or rub it on, you won't get the concealer where it needs to be.<br>  <br>  Step 3<br>  Use a sponge to dab a tiny bit of powder (in a moisture-rich formula) onto the spot you're trying to hide. Follow this with a light dusting of powder over the entire face to set your makeup. Be careful not to apply too much to already dried-out skin. Drier skin plus breakouts may mean you're being too aggressive with your skin.<br>  <br>  What to Get:<br>  <br>  Maybelline New York Pure Concealer, $6 at drugstores<br>  Or <br>  Bobbi Brown Blemish Cover Stick, $20<br>  <br>  Neutrogena Healthy Defense Protective Powder SPF 30, $12 at drugstores<br>  Or<br>  Lanc?me Dual Finish Versatile Powder Makeup, $33<br>  <br>  <br>  Diminish Redness<br>  <br>  Step 1<br>  Women with light or medium skin, who are especially prone to redness, can use a color-correcting concealer on such prominent areas as the chin and nose. Typically tinted green (a color that visibly counteracts the red), these products restore skin to a neutral tone. If the product is thick, make it blend more easily by applying it over a lightweight moisturizer — look for those formulated for sensitive skin or labeled "hypoallergenic" — and spreading it gently with your ring finger or a sponge.<br>  <br>  Step 2<br>  Finish with a light foundation or a tinted moisturizer over the entire face. Over application of foundation can cause even darker blotches on the skin. A light layer of subtle makeup will veil the redness and make you look as if you have a healthy, rosy glow.<br>  <br>  What to Get:<br>  <br>  Physicians Formula Wanderful Wand Brightening Cream Concealer, $7 at drug-stores<br>  Or <br>  Eucerin Redness Relief Tone Perfecting Crème, $15 at drugstores<br>  <br>  Almay Smart Shade Makeup SPF 15, $14 at drugstores<br>  Or <br>  Clinique Perfectly Real Makeup, $22.50|`|6f939f34f50f68147d7ee881dd743609aa	what about concealer?<br>  <br>  Bare minerals works really well but its expensive so if you dont have the money, then go to any drug store and get one of those cover up sticks. Get the green ones because green will mask the redness|`|bhyUX6kkaa	When ever you are trying to cover something up you need to look at the color and find the opposing color to cover it with. For example, the concealer used to cover very dark black skin is actually orange because the undertones of the skin is nearly purple. <br>  Take a look at a color wheel and pin point the base color of your problem area then use the wheel to find the right color tint you should look for in your concealer. <br>  If you have trouble with this then try asking a makeup artist (there are some good ones at department store counters or sephora...)|`|KgIrT8jKaa	First I would clean my face everyday.I would suggest to use noxzema pads or any kind of noxzema product because they work the best.then when your done after you face dries you can put this blemish oil on it that will get rid of any pimple scars that you have left.My advice would be not to use liquid foundation.I would use a concealer stick and then put a cover up powder over it that matches your skin color.<br>  <br>  Hope this helps.good luck.|`|xgRgPkCiaa	After you put the liquid foundation put powder that is the shade of your skin over it.

wpdAiQIWaa	Well, those big waves are achievable in 2 different ways: the first one is by curling you hair chemically (I recommend you to take that picture to the hairstylist so that he/she has an idea of how you want it to be done), and the other one is by using a big ceramic curler iron. Here's how to do it: <br>  1-Open the curling iron by holding your four fingers around the handle while pushing your thumb down on the moving part of handle. <br>  <br>  2- Stop at the root.Clip the curling iron onto a half an inch strand of hair at the top part of your hair, the part closest to the root, by lifting your thumb.Then slide it down to the tip of your hair. Be sure to stop before it completely slides off. Pull iron down to the tip of your hair.]]Start curling your hair in the direction you want it to curl in, for example curve it under if you want an inward curl. <br>  <br>  3- Curl your hair upward toward the root.Continue to curl your hair until you reach the top part of your hair and hold it there for 10 seconds.<br>  <br>  4-Slowly and gently start to uncurl your hair until you reach a point where you can press your thumb down again without your hair holding your curling iron shut. (The slower you let it come down, the longer the curls will hold.) <br>  <br>  5-Open and close the curling iron until you ease it out of your hair. <br>  <br>  6-Repeat the steps on all of your hair that you want curled. <br>  <br>  7-Use fingers to tousle hair. Also use hairspray and a comb to slightly tease hair to create volume.<br>  <br>  Hope it helped!|`|XFFMmXvkaa	It looks like they put it up in large pin curls when it was wet and then let it dry natural or i guess you could use a dryer but then when dry don't comb it, run your fingers through it to separate it some and give it direction.
pqMb1jsKaa	I would have thought the answer to this question was simple - it asks what you like more in a WOMAN, not a young boy.  So obviously the answer is going to be curves, unlike what "ilovetwirls" seems to say - which, given her screen name, I doubt VERY much if she's in any shape (literally) to slate women with curves.  it just isn't naturally possible to be skinny *and* have curves without plastic surgery, and even then, what's the point in having boobs that look and feel like rocks, have no movement, and have that terrible look of "I've just stitched a couple of kids-sized footballs to my chest; aren't I hot?"  Because the answer is clearly a resounding, "no."  Incidentally, the same goes for skinny legs with a bum, as well as a skinny waist - there are those that have the "toffee-apple" body shape with skinny legs and a bum, but their waist is far from a size 8.  The only way to have skinny legs and waist as well as a nice-sized bum is, again, surgery.  I'll refer you to Jennifer Lopez at this point.  Enough said.<br>  <br>  Skinny girls - around a size 8-10 - quite often have no boobs at all (unless they're fake, eh, "ilovetwirls"?), no hips, and no bum.  What they do have, quite repulsively, is visible rib-cages above the abdomen, visible ribs between the breasts, gaunt faces, what I would call "dog-ear boobs" (boobs that resemble the shape and size of a floppy King Charles Spaniel's ears - saggy, empty sacs of skin), and bony hip-bones poking out.  Trust me, it's not sexy to look emaciated - I often wonder whether I should go up to a skinny girl, take her home, tie her up and force-feed her until she has an actual nature-intended shape, rather than that "I haven't so much as sniffed a carb in three years" look that's all so popular at the moment.   Bleugh.|`|LB3meZSfaa	People who are saying skinny are saying curvy ,<br>  and those saying curvy , are curvey lmfao.<br>  Nah , but like right in the middle .<br>  I would say I'm about average size (in my opinion not everyone elses')<br>  everyone else thinks im skinny, I wear 3's & 5's and I love my body.<br>  Curvy & skinny people say they like it too, so that's what I would go with.<br>  Curves in all the right places, but toned in other places.|`|LRc5BxUZaa	Will people stop sayig skinny is really bad please cus i'm naturally skinny!|`|b3532db70f45af9e0861017ebadbea02aa	well most guys like skinny girls with curves.|`|98z1KLLiaa	Guys like skinny girls.<br>  <br>  Model like on tv ; /<br>  <br>  but then again im not a guy|`|ZiTIghRLaa	I like my women to have curves.

pqMb1jsKaa	Dark hair is always more attractive for me.

But other than not hiding the red spots, it isn't visible on your skin and doesn't cause breakouts. So if that's what you are looking for, I definitely recommend the MaryKay mineral powder. [:|`|DwinhfBraa	You should use 100% Pure or Bare Minerals|`|2vHIn8VMaa	I like using Stilla|`|iu4SOin3aa	Check out a store called Ulta online, they have moneral powder that works like a charm.

2PD9YUNGaa	Depends what you consider safe. Dying your hair more than once causes it to become super plasticish and dry, perhaps even fall out because it becomes so weak & brittle. I once did something similar to what you are thinking of doing, and the colors NEVER turn out the way you want because of the undercolor.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't do it, its just too much for your hair.

Everyone is different. Embrace your inner-oldness. And by the way, don't wear your makeup too dark or people will think you look even older.<br>  <br>  edit: woaahhh...hold on a sec... why three bras? That's extremely unneccesary. Are you TRYING to make yourself look older?|`|TuGtkgy4aa	first of all, don't wear heels until you are in college.<br>  second of all, you're 11, you don't need big boobs.

That's not something that older people do. It's just weird.<br>  Third: Yes, I think you are growing up too fast. There's nothing wrong with hanging out with older kids and being attracted to guys, but wearing 3-inch heels and all that makeup, cursing, and rolling up skirts is a bit much. Slow down. You'll have plenty of time to do all that when you're at least 13+. I mean, seriously. There's no rush. And the way you're acting, people might start saying some pretty bad things about you.|`|p8otQ2vuaa	light make up will be best for you, and less heels like 1 1/2 inch or two.<br>  its okay to roll skirts<br>  try to bond with young people for some time.<br>  its okay if ur pale, again less makeup<br>  its normal for teenagers to cuss, but not all the time<br>  and for the bras, you only wear one.|`|kuViEbCsaa	you are a freakk.. you are acting too old for your age.. and wear too much make up.. you might turn horrid further on in your life from wearing so much make up so STOP <br>  <br>  and i mean wtf wearing loadsa bra's to make your boobs bigger.. youre just pretending to be something youre not.. if anything being fake is a bad thing :)|`|hjS7HA7daa	Act your age hun your 11 you should be doing kids stuff xD I am 15 and I started wearing make up at 14 d/w about tht stuff.

ktBWP1Uxaa	Well, your best best would be Cocoa Butter or the cream you get with pregnancies. Also, try just searching around on Google and finding what other people use to broaden your choices. Everyone has them, don't feel like you're the only one.|`|SBDYOb58aa	Most women have stretchmarks. They will fade over time. Nothing gets rid of them unless you invest in pricey laser surgery, and that doesn't always work. There are no magic creams or potions that will eliminate them.<br>  <br>  You can try maderma for scars, but that will only minimize their appearance, if it does anything. Cocoa butter and things like that won't make them go away.<br>  <br>  You will get them as you grow, if you gain weight, when you get pregnant. Guys even get them. Learn to love them ... because they will never completely disappear.|`|jhjn1QVQaa	Please don't be fooled by those "magical" creams.  You can't get rid of stretchmarks.  Trust me, I've tried.  They are caused by gaining or losing weight rapidly AND a poor diet.  They will fade with time, don't worry.  Just follow a healthy diet and keep your skin hydrated (drink lots of water and use a good moisturizer daily) so you won't get any more.|`|LPxKxA6Taa	stretch marks are caused either by gaining weight or losing weight to fast with extra skin. go to local drugstores and there should be medication that gets rid of stretch marks|`|NDQS5HJyaa	It's normal--a lot of people have stretch marks. There really isn't a big no fail solution to getting rid of them, but cocoa butter can help prevent and help them fade away with time.

When he walks past you talk a bit louder, but not overly loud else he'll just find it weird.<br>  Do something different with your hair, like if you put it up then have it down for once, or if it's always straight then curl it and if it's curly then straighten it etc. Don't change completely though just something little like your hairstyle but at least so he notices. (:|`|Ue56xZ7vaa	don't try to MAKE anyone like you or think you are this or that, because 99% of the time it wont work and you are just wasting your time for nothing.<br>  if he dosen't notice you or like you then that's his loss.|`|W6LGsQC8aa	You can't MAKE anyone like you.<br>  <br>  Why waste your valuable time on someone who won't return the favor?<br>  <br>  Find a guy willing to put in effort to be with YOU!|`|dat8eoYyaa	move on|`|OMPSzNUdaa	in the hall way, be a little loud so that he notices you, and the catch his eye, and smile or wink or whatever.. and then try and tlk to him later, and give him your numberr.

AA10311933	you can use sugar to exfoliate twice a week.. I hope you have honey and eggs at home because you can mix an egg yolk with some honey and apply it on your skin for 10-15 mins twice a week.. mashed bananas are also good.. milk applied with a cotton wool for 10 mins everyday and then rinsed.. just make sure it's full fat.. egg yolk with a little vegetable oil(olive is best but could be pricey)<br>  i'll write some more if i remember..
eur4jAc3aa	I tease my hair all the time and its fine as ever, as long as you use a good conditioner you should be fine, Look at guys like C.C. Deville from Poison - He teased his hair every night for a concert back in the 80's and his hair always looked in great shape and still does to this day !<br>  <br>  When teasing your hair  try not to be very rough with it, Gently backcomb at the roots of your hair then spray with hairspray.

I was going to get a KA but opted for the 206 instead and it has given me nothing but trouble. Peugeot's are poorly built whereas Ford's have a great reputation.

However the ford Ka would be lighter but in contrast has a slightly smaller boot|`|28708e44a74e534c3bc9c9ad362c928aaa	I would go for the Ford. French cars have loads of technology but usually they go wrong. Also Peugeot's have weird UV filtered windscreens so you have to get external aerials for Sat navs and sometimes even mobiles don't work that well in them. French cars are not that good, but that's just my opinion.|`|Ograco3laa	car 1 its so cute i think its a chick car thats y i like it|`|PTWjkYu8aa	i would pick car 1|`|0449992e5db7c419a2aed6504f012c08aa	Go for the Ka.

afB6WFRzaa	Is your curly hair tight or loose? Either way, thinning your hair is all about how they do it. I have curly hair but its a medium curl and its pretty fine, so I don't have much frizz to begin with; but I've had my hair thinned to where it's frizzy. So it's all about how they thin it out. I would recommend seeing a stylist who specializes in curly hair, or even a salon. To keep curly hair from becoming frizzy is all about your product choice and aftercare. A big tip I would suggest is after you have chosen a style, whether you air dry or diffuse, LEAVE IT ALONE. Don't touch and play with curly hair, unless you want that tousled, frizzy look. Diffusing is a great way to quickly dry curly hair and leave it frizz free. Pay attention to the main ingredients of your styling products. Too much alcohol can dry your hair out, in turn causing frizz. Use a good moisturizing shamp and cond and treat it with care.|`|BtK9nSalaa	yeah don't get it thinned. it'll b poofier and frizzier and makes your ends ratty. i have curly hair|`|2diobki7aa	My friends have had this done. They have really thick hair too, and according to them, it REALLY helps. No, it doesn't cause frizz. They thin it using a razor. (: Good luck!|`|RkIgHyRCaa	Check out <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlpix" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlpix</a> to get some style ideas, then visit <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com/curlsalons</a> to find a curl stylist expert in your area. It's important to see someone who really knows how to work with curly hair. Most stylists don't get any training with curly hair in beauty school.|`|XFFMmXvkaa	They use a pair of scissors that cut the hair in different lengths and yes it will frizz more as it has several different short pieces of hair all over the head. I think it would be easier to just use a product to straighten it or defrizz it after the shampoo.One day you will like it.I promise i have thick curly  hair and now i love it! My daughters both do as well and now as they are older can fix it so  many different ways .Also how old are you? Our hair changes with age and usually at puberty it softens out some too.|`|fiLBBB6Maa	I have curly hair too and it will usually get poofier and bigger when it's thinner.  They thin it with a blade basically which just cuts away part of the hair that makes it thick.|`|5uAaJfaaaa	i have the same problem.<br>  dont get it thinned out, my friend did that and it went frizzier and worse.|`|wNPhFNACaa	i had the same problem my hair was WAY tooooo thick and unmangable. so what i did, being a fan of choppy layers cut some layers into my hair by myslef going on nothing but a picture of layers in my head my hair came out hotter and thinner so take a chance good luck. and there are alot of products out there to de rizz your hair but the one i found to be best was my wet to straight straightener. <br>  Good Luck|`|QwerW9daaa	When i go to the hairdressers, my hairdresser does this thing where she runs her scissors down the inside of the hair which doesn't affect the cut of the hair but takes a couple of chunks out to thin it out.<br>  When you go to the salon ask your hairdresser these questions, they will know what to do. Just ask about the frizz, she could probably tell you a product that could calm it down a bit.<br>  Hope this helped you.<br>  x|`|naTwoHAGaa	it wont get frizzer.  my friend did it and she had very thick hair.  the way they thin it is by cutting with scissor  that have a comb in them.  its kinda cool and works.|`|fN8Js8aeaa	You should get layers and thin it out<br>  <br>  They thin it by taking scissors and scraping them downward, it doesnt hurt or anything, but its no good to do often: just every couple of months.|`|4d39218667eb8c323bab12b2798e6a3caa	go to a stylist and ask for a razor cut it might cause more frizzies im not sure
aEGgO5Knaa	What I do is i straigten my hair the night before and go to sleep so it gets a little oily [i know it sounds gross but its better to not wash everyday anyway] and then I put gel on the ends of my hair, or wherever I want it to curl. I let the gel dry and then curl it with the iron. It lasts for like 7-8 hours.|`|DSLMxNN0aa	I don't know but I have the same problem.

I was late to have boobs too. The summer between 7th and 8th grades I went from an A to a C! Now I am a 34D. Be careful what you wish for!!!<br>  Puberty comes slower for girls that are petite, more active(sporty). Dont freak out. Now if you dont get your period by this time next year, I would start to be worried. For now, let nature take its course. Since you are petite, you may have smaller boobs, and thats ok. Sometimes having large breasts like me can hamper your ability to do certain things and wear certain things. Good luck!|`|XvjfvGohaa	well usually when people gain weight, they also get bigger boobs... you can try that. also you can try a padded of push up bra... it might be noticeable though if one day you walk into school and your boobs look bigger. don't stuff. don't wear two bras. and don't listen to your friends...you'll get your period when you're ready and consider yourself lucky to not have it yet, it sucks lol.<br>  <br>  there's some really good push up and padded bras at vicotriassecret.com but they're kind of expensive. you can also try target... i got some from there too. so many stores can sell you push up padded bras.<br>  <br>  don't worry about not having huge boobs, it would look weird for a petite girl to have big boobs! enhance them with a bra and be proud =)|`|Ztee02csaa	i started in 5th grade, but i have larger boobs, im 14 and have a C cup. you can't do anything about making them bigger unless you want to get fat to :p<br>  <br>  your just a late bloomer itll be fine, just work with what you got :)|`|WRRRChiaaa	I'm in 9th grade.<br>  And have a b cup.<br>  <br>  it's nothing to worry about. it depends on your genes.<br>  It'll happen.|`|dRpcwZcdaa	Everyone starts growing at different times... i started at 7!!!!!!|`|j51RT5vAaa	its all up to the genes. are any of ur relative's breast really big? or ur mom's? there really isnt anything u can do to make them bigger except wait. dont worry sweety some girls are late bloomers|`|WWQ4PAdJaa	I didn't get boobs til I was 13 or 14 and they didn't get very big until I gained weight in the past couple of years.

8bd2f6800f0622bdcf1b1a4141b9ed49aa	Ok...<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a biochemist and I work with skin everyday. All liquid makeup will clog your skin.This is because of the parafins, waxes, oils etc.. added to a "liquid" makeup to keep it not only unseparated but to prolong shelf life and congealing. In essence you are covering your pores and not allowing them to breathe and trust me your skin is your largest organ and needs plenty of breathing room. <br>  <br>  Now all that said I would recommend you use the Mineralogie makeup line and by the way if you can't find it, we carry in our office. All the mineral makeup companies 10 years ago were under one company called color science. Then you had all these people make there own version (i.e. bare essentials crap etc...) and the orginal company changed theie naem to Mineralogie. This does not contain high talc like other which makes your subaceous glands/oil glads. go into over drive and produce sebum / oil. Mineralogie gives you full mineral sun protection which is different then chemically based sublocks in that chemical ones absorbs UV, do damage to the underlying dermis but you dont burn so the aging is accelerated and you see the results later. Mineral sublock however acts like a mirror and blocks all UVA (longest wavelength and causes damage to underlying tissue for long term damage, UVB (would burn what you can see- your epedermis), and UVC (atmospheric radiation). Bare essentials has huuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuge amounts of talc and will break you out. Trahs it immediately. Also, you should be washing your brushes with antibacterial soap once a week minimum to kill all the bacteria breading inside the bristles. <br>  <br>  Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Double Face Perefector would be a good concealer for under eyes and blemishes. Probably in light.<br>  <br>  You never put on moisturizer if you have oily skin. <br>  <br>  email with any questions you may have.|`|KgIrT8jKaa	First to get rid of oily skin dont put coverup over it to get rid of it.every morning while getting ready you should clean your face.i would suggest noxzema pads thats what i use and they work great.you can still you use coverup but wait until you clean your face and it dries to put it on.<br>  <br>  Hope this works for you.|`|CNrzFqmTaa	just use whatever cover-up you want. but oil blotting papers, they work wonders on my skin! = ]|`|mbqI6wHAaa	listen to the first that answerd ur question

3ece80164c2739cc39f908768c919b69aa	Pantene Renewal Shampoos are great shampoos that will help keep your hair moisturized, soft, and silky. They will also help to repair damaged and dry hair. Whenever you blow dry or flat iron your hair, you are drying out your hair, your hair needs moisture to stay healthy, just like your body needs water to stay healthy. If you must blow dry your hair, use shampoos that work with your hair dryer and also work to moisturize your hair so that you do not damage your hair again. Nexxus makes a Phyto Organics Theratin Shampoo that is an extreme moisturizer shampoo. Some shampoo brands also have special formulas designed for people who blow dry their hair that actually are heat activated and help to protect your hair. Let your hair air dry whenever possible, and use the coolest setting (cold air is best) on your hair dryer whenever you feel the need to blow dry your hair. <br>  <br>  For an all natural way to moisturize your hair, put 1/3 cup milk in a spray bottle. Spray it all over your hair, comb it thru your hair, leave it on for 20 minutes. Then, shampoo and condition your hair with a good moisturizing shampoo and condition. I like to choose shampoos and conditioners that contain natural moisturizing agents such as aloe and coconut oil. Make sure to rinse your hair throughly with lukewarm water when you shampoo your hair (not hot water). <br>  <br>  Good luck to you!

If youre going to use studs, make sure they are long enough for when you swell up.. And it would probably help to mark them so you know theyre even..AND it would be good if you could get a friend to help you out, it would probably be easier for them to put the needle through.. After the needle is in, use the jewelry to push it out while youre putting it in..<br>  <br>  To clean, use mouthwash, but dilute it halfway with water.. And for the outside, use Softsoap, its anti-bacterial hand soap.. Good luck!!|`|eEznnpnVaa	Why not just go get it done professionally so you don't have to worry about it? <br>  <br>  You have to mark both sides of the lip (and no, you can't do it with a pen)--and since you're piercing yourself, you won't be able to see both sides at the same time without a complex construction of mirrors. You'll also have to hold the forceps properly and be watching yourself to make sure you're piercing straight through to the other side.

Bleach blonde hair with Chunks of Pink in the fringe).<br>  <br>  You need to dress in bright vibrant colours, and tight fitting clothes (tight t-shirts, skinnies, vans...etc), also, animal print is a must!<br>  <br>  The main "scene" colours are mostly neon colours, (eg.

xU3uBy4Saa	The throbbing is most likely cause by you sleeping on it.  A suggestion I have so you can sleep on your side is getting a small towel and rolling it like a hotdog, then put it in the shape of an "O". And then you can rest your ear in the empty spot of the towel.  Pain free! Or you can do the same with your arm.  Cross it and put your ear is the free area.  Also, just be careful when you are changing shirts and what not, ANY slight pressure can cause it to hurt.|`|9xpFsVJSaa	Well, that usually happens when you put pressue on it..<br>  Have you?

You can pull off almost any look -- short or long, straight or wavy. But for the most flattering look on you, consider your best feature and highlight it with your haircut. <br>  <br>  If you have gorgeous bone structure, consider an angular bob that shows off your chin. Great eyes? Blunt or side-swept bangs are a great bet. <br>  <br>  Styles that are flattering and stylish: sophisticated bobs, bangs, long, beachy waves (think California surfer girl). <br>  <br>  Avoid: Short layers that add height on top of your head. Aside from being dated, short layers can make your face appear long. If your hair is thick or curly, avoid a blunt cut. You'll look like a pyramid. If you have curly hair, short hair is generally a no-no (see "10 Secrets to Styling Curly Hair"). Try shoulder-length or longer to weigh down curls. <br>  <br>  Celebs who share your face shape: Kate Hudson, Jessica Alba, Jada Pinkett Smith <br>  <br>  Tools you can't live without: A great curling iron and flatiron to create waves and straighten your sleek locks. <br>  <br>  <br>  I RECOMMEND DARKENING YOUR HAIR AND GOING WITH STRAIGHT ACROSS BANGS LIKE THIS:<br>  <a href="http://smashingstyles.com/uploads/2008/11/long-layered-hairstyles-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://smashingstyles.com/uploads/2008/1...</a>|`|LcEY08kAaa	i think side bangs are nice on you, but i think you should cut them shorter and a bit fuller like this :<br>  <a href="http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/03/side-swept-bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.imageandstylenews.com/wp-cont...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.aaa-fashion.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/bangs.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.aaa-fashion.com/wp-content/up...</a><br>  <br>  something like that, dont go for reeaal bangs, nope,|`|YWaUaPaSaa	side swept

Personally I like to separate my hair into 6 sections (i have a lot of hair you might only need 4), then you take each section and twist it tightly. It will curl up on itself. Pin the ends to your head (or you can use a pony tail elastic. If you want the waves really defined put some hairspray on. Sleep on it, take it down in the morning and run your fingers through it.

f8a1395066a4e7dd0ff6d7f82d96ab35aa	No. Coarse, and probably thick, curly hair is something she's born with and you can't change it without harsh and dangerous chemicals. It looks "rough" because that's the texture of her hair and you can't change that; I don't know, there's just something about that comment that makes me think "are you kidding me?". If you expect her hair to look like and act like straight hair then you're going to be very dissappointed. I have the feeling that you might be treating her hair like you would straight hair and that's where the problem lies. These are two completely different hair textures and types and they need different types of hair products to stay healthy and you wouldn't treat them both the same as far as trying to manage and style. <br>  <br>  Try putting her hair in styles that can last several days. Also, only use a wide tooth comb to comb her hair when it's wet and has conditioner or shampoo in it because this will make it easier. Find a good detangling product. You'll get frustrated if you try to comb her dry hair every day. There are many products on the market for curly hair and you should look into those. Also, look over the Internet for better ways to take care of her hair in its natural state and you'll learn a lot that will make it easier for you and her. You'll also get a lot of information on her hair type and texture.|`|OyOQES3paa	johnsons baby shampoo|`|UsH9kex3aa	If it seems to be a health problem you should take her to the doctor, but if it's simply cosmetic wait until she is old enough to decide what she wants to do for herslef.

J8LASik0aa	Okay...NEVER (!!!!) straighten wet hair. Even if it is a wet-to-dry, like you said. It burns your hair and makes it dry and brittle. Make sure your hair is 100% dry before you start. <br>  <br>  If you have thin hair, you can just start straightening. But if you have really thick hair, put the top layer of your hair in a ponytail and straighten the bottom part first. <br>  <br>  Don't start right at the roots, but pretty close. Clamp the flat iron on a 1-3 inch wide section of hair, and slowly apply pressure and pull it down. If you have really curly or wavy hair you might have to repeat this a few times on each section to get it completely straight. Completely straighten your hair, and remember to get all of the back.|`|LIlLGRSYaa	no dont start at the roots, start where your hair come off your head|`|RF7VL5Ydaa	it helps if you pin up the hair that you aren't using, and straighten it in layers, from the bottom to the top. you start at the roots, clamp the straightener over your hair and pull it down until you've reached the bottom.<br>  <br>  have fun :)|`|RNYGEf5Vaa	Well I'll give you the steps.<br>  1.NEVER start from the roots, you'll burn your hair!<br>  2.

Pick up the straightener and start from about the the width of 3 fingers and pull down slowly.<br>  <br>  4 repeat and comb.<br>  <br>  5.spritz with some hair spray and comb.|`|nHV3sKJ3aa	You can't start at the roots, you'd burn yourself.<br>  Just start wherever it isn't straight and pull down.|`|eae97eaa844c2cc627c590b1f3d3380baa	Well actually I never used a straightener in my life because I naturally have straight hair.|`|PdSeeHdkaa	Well heat up your Straightener until you think its ready.<br>  <br>  1) Comb out your hair<br>  2) Separate your hair into sections ( using, bands, elastics etc..)<br>  3) Comb the first section<br>  4) Its good to have a heat protection pray ( spray it on your sectioned hair)<br>  5) Start 3 inch's or more (don't start from your roots)  from your roots and slowy ( don't stay in one place for to long - burns hair ) pull down<br>  6) Do this about 2 - 3 times, depends on how thick or thin your hair is.<br>  7) Now let down your sections and do the same :)|`|rxmubcdwaa	i also have a remmington its a t-studio well since my hairs naturally curly and thick i seperate my hair into sections and straighten each section at a time.starting at my root but you should wait untill your hair cools to straighten it over so you dont fry your hait.what i would do is blow your hair out and thn straighten it never straighten it when ur hairs wet because it may fry and get frizzy. <br>  <br>  hope i helped : D|`|bWRetyRzaa	hey there!!  ok, so the best way to straighten your hair with the best results is to wash it first.  after you wash it, put in a straight serum, heat protector, or a leave in conditioner and blow dry it straight down with a paddle brush.  then, get some big clips or a hair tie and put half of your hair in a pony tail and put it to the side.  then, take the half that you're going to work with, and clip the top half of it on top of your head.  then get your straightener and straighten it starting as high as you can go without touching your scalp, and clamp down the straightening iron, and pull it down all the way to the ends slowly.  you may have to repeat the process on the same section of hair a few times.  hope i helped!!  can you please try to answer my question?  thanks!!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjglGttmMakxpDIEzjTcQ2bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112933AAoW9Po">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|ZfDa40PEaa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov7NWAWPbzk" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ov7NWAWPb...</a><br>  <br>  i hope it helps :)|`|9KFfjun8aa	What I do is put your hair half up half down depending on if your hair is thick or not! Mine is THICK!! just start a inch or two down from the roots and straighting away!! hope this helps!!|`|hUZF9rrbaa	Pretty much, that straightner is really<br>  good.....well if you have hair that takes<br>  really long to straighten then put the heat<br>  on 30. :D Oh where did you get it because<br>  I can't find the 2inch one anywhere!!!|`|v9x3xGpvaa	yesss. pull back parts of your hair and do it by sections.start from the top of the roots.
udpdCqQ2aa	Well they are not cheap..they are around 50-100$..<br>  <br>  No you don't have to dye ur hair if you can match up the color of ur hair to the color of the extensions perfecticly..<br>  <br>  LOL vote me as best! :)|`|07YBD5mJaa	Nope, they match the extensions to your natural hair color.<br>  But be wary, extensions are very expensive.|`|AA12361739	First of all extensions come in an array of colors,lenghts,textures,styles,tracks that you glue on, clip-on,sew ons, wavy, straight, crinkle,shirley temple curls, etc.. that's how the price is determined. Now if you find the match to your hair color your fine then you don't dye your hair. When you to the beauty supply store you ask them to take it out the bag because you want to see if it matches your hair and put it up to your hair in the mirror they provide, if your not sure ask another customer in the store, because for some reason the seller of the store will tell you it matches and it doesn't so be for sure because most of the time they won't exchange hair. GOOD LUCK!! Human hair prices vary from 29.00 on up the longer it is the more it cost.|`|tHCEfqnGaa	U can either make sure the extenions u get are pretty darn close to ur hair color OR u can just dye the extensions to match ur hair color IF they are human hair, if they are synthetic extensions DONT because u will basically kill them lolz
wpdAiQIWaa	I think everything will be ok, unless the perm touches ur scalp. You should tell the hairdresser not to put the chemical in contact with your scalp and the roots of your hair. Believe me I've been permanent straightenig my hair for a year and a half now, but as I didn't know what I'm telling you know before the last time I got one, I'm having some hard time with hair loss, but I guess it is because hair that was in contact with the perm started breaking. So I should wait like 6 to 8 months before thinking of doing another perm. The perm I've been having is Wellastraite, and you technically have to renew it every 3 months or so but, as I told you, wait like 6 to 8 months before straightening you hair again.<br>  I hope you understood everything I told you, be careful, and sorry for my bad engish! :P|`|BDvgYNkKaa	haha same and same<br>  i relax my hair and i had this same question and apparently this is what my hairstylist told me and it makes a lot of sense, "dont listen to anyone else, the hair that you have on your head is already dead. The chemicals do not seep through to the hair follicles in your scalp, therefore, it cannot make you bald. If you have bald heredity thats another story..." and the new hair that grows in will be your original hair texture thats why people have to go for touch ups every couple months (2-4).<br>  <br>  hope i helped|`|nKruEEuhaa	Unless you suffer major burns or wounds to your scalp and damage your hair bulb, the regrowth will be fine.|`|axPP8XYuaa	no it only burns the hair that you straighten
nKruEEuhaa	I am assuming that you recently cut bangs ? If you parted your hair in the middle before, your hair has been "trained" that way, so now that you have bangs you need to just style them and they will eventually stop parting because your hair will be accustomed to not being parted in the middle. <br>  <br>  In the beginning you will need to use more product to keep them in place, like hair spray, pomade, wax, gel, which ever you prefer. Also blow drying them into the desired style helps vs just letting them dry naturally.|`|RF7VL5Ydaa	in the morning when you're doing your hair, lift them up and backcomb a little bit at the roots, then use a little hairspray. you should be good to go :)|`|U7SnmcxYaa	gel, hairspray.|`|2glmH9Jbaa	blow dry them with a curling brush. you know, the round one thats a cylinder. then you can spray just a squirtt of hairspray on the brush and comb it though once more.|`|lzbEEg5Daa	Heyyy<br>  Hmmm.... try to use elastic hairbands to help you,<br>  I use it on my hair... they actually work  :)<br>  Hope this helps<br>  Or its possible you use hair spray, make sure it doesn't<br>  damage your hair :)|`|6AYuQ27Aaa	Try using hair spray.<br>  It'll hold them in place.<br>  If the hair spray doesn't work, use hair gel.
bWRetyRzaa	of course!!!!  just push them to the side (you might need to use a tiny tiny bit of gel since they're so short) or just grow them out, literally a fraction of an inch and either push them to the side or have your stylist layer them and then straighten them.  hope i helped!  please answer my question, too!!<br>  <br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AjglGttmMakxpDIEzjTcQ2bsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222112933AAoW9Po">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|H2bFiDNAaa	yeah, i did|`|YBltXf0waa	yes its possible|`|8vbUOxjxaa	not if you have a small forehead.

You'll see some examples in there.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	Ignore all those rude people.  There is nothing wrong with small breasts!!   If you've been measured you can be sure that it's probably correct.  Also size can change as you grow older, or put on weight.  I started out in an A cup and after puberty I grew to 34C.  <br>  <br>  Remember that the # refers to your measurement around the rib cage and the letter is your cup size.<br>  <br>  Anyway think of like the Olsen twins.

With that already in mind, things seem smaller far away on a proportion level, such as noses and lips.  Some things may become dominant such as eyebrows and cheekbones.  It's an abstract version of the person due to the fact that things are vagure far away since your eyes can only accurately see something from a certain distance.|`|iFCBEZW7aa	When your close up you tend to notice every freckle, spot or whatever.<br>  I notice that too, shame but oh well.|`|ArFFUPTBaa	hmm, i wonder the same thing.<br>  Maybe perspective.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	it's the opposite for me.  lol.  i don't like my complexion.<br>  <br>  maybe you have body shape/size issues?|`|DwinhfBraa	Its perspectives

Our face is like our hair. If you keep trying different shampoos your hair starts to fall off. <br>  <br>  So what you do, is wash your face with sugar at night before going to bed and when waking up. Your face will feel softest. the sugar opens your pores and takes out the oil. Just try it once and you feel the softest. And if you continue to wash your face with sugar in the next week or so you will see the difference. I've seen the difference. My face is perfectly fine now.|`|xsmJzO6kaa	Other than using products on your skin, the best way to prevent acne is watching what you eat. Acne is also caused by a not well balanced diet.

In fact, you might get a dark blue tie to go with the lighter blue shirt.  The tie for the dark blue shirt can be any color and design that looks good.  Or you could go for the more casual look and banish the ties, depending upon the style of dress in the place where you work,.   It would all look very professional.  Don't forget to wear it with an air of confidence and just a hint of a swagger. Hold your head high and smile at people you meet.  Works every time.|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	Absolutely. <br>  <br>  Most colors go with black but I would actually go for the lighter blue shirt for more contrast.<br>  <br>  Make sure your belt and shoes are black.|`|BsKxtMGJaa	i think either one will look fine|`|WZHVjs0uaa	guess so|`|6qSxpr1paa	the dark blue is the right way to do i will tell you that much and trust me i grew up with lots of outfits like that and dark blue is the best looking|`|97EHXLb7aa	doesnt matter if they match or not, ur a dog anyway
WDbE5gffaa	Think it would look great from whats described.<br>  You could try doing all blonde highlights, and putting on a temporary very bright red, on every other strand through the highlight cap. That would look awesome :) and in about 2 months, (depending on the red dye you use) it will all be blonde highlights again.
bPtOAysQaa	no, they are not supposed to be stinging. it doesn't mean anything serious, but you should rinse them a few times just to be sure all of the product is off. they may just sting for a while because the skin in your arm pit is very sensitive. also, don't use it again, you may have a slight allergy to it.|`|itiJVgRsaa	It should not be stinging but Veet is not really for armpits. the bottle says it is, but it's not. shaving armpits irritates them so why use a depilatory on them? if your armpits were already broken out or irritated then that could be y they are stinging.

aEGgO5Knaa	Straight across bangs,a little shorter and angled around the face?|`|SwFaa4Zzaa	its a riskier move since you have longer hair.<br>  but i think a razored cut right at/under you jaw line would look cute with your face shape.<br>  and maybe get your bangs a bit choppier to go with that.|`|va8Saxxmaa	you should get your hair layered it would make it not as plain

oA066Stbaa	you need two different shades that can blend easily and look good toghether, then pt themon like that and blend it, you can also make your brush wet to blend better and the hearts i think there is soehing that you need to buy it's like a tube kinda like lip gloss and then you use the brush and put it on and you get hearts.|`|7BVyV4Fdaa	1. You'll need a lose powder for eyeshadow. (EX: Loreal H.I.P. or MAC are great) Black liquid eyeliner, mascara, and colored eye liner. <br>  <br>  2. Sweep color one, like her gold onto your whole eyelid. <br>  <br>  3. Take color two, and BLEND it into your other color. If you need to, add more of the first color to make it stand out more. Just layer, don't add a whole bunch to begin with. <br>  <br>  4. Take your eyeliner, black in color and line your eyes. <br>  <br>  5. Add mascara. <br>  <br>  6. Draw the hearts with the eyeliner color of your choice on your cheek bone. =)<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|plBXp91Daa	I think it is better if yo put the  golden/yellow eyeshadow first and then the purple one.<br>  Nice eye make up maybe i should try this too.|`|zUcELjQMaa	buy two eye shadows, purple and yellow, and blend them smoothly together over your eye lids, starting with the yellow ending just above your crease, then shading the purple in up until your brow.<br>  . for the hearts, use a small paintbrush, get it wet, and use the eye shadow as you would if it were paint, and paint the little hearts beside your eyes.<br>  the blending part is sometimes a tough. use your finger to help blend them evenly.<br>  <br>  good luck!!|`|Yue2YKTnaa	it doesn't have to be MAC or you don't have to hire an expensive make-up artist <br>  <br>  im pretty sure she did it herself<br>  use yellow eyeshadow on the lid and purple on the crease<br>  cat eyeliner and false lashes<br>  rosy blush on the cheeks<br>  <br>  the hearts are drawn on with eyeliner|`|Gew6pZhbaa	The hearts are fake. She added them using the computer. Using a highly pigmented shadow, such as HIP, use a gold shade along the inner top lash line. Then apply the purple shade over your crease and to the outer top lash line. Stick with a shadow brush.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	There are good videos on youtube on how to make your eyes look like this. Search blended eyeshadow or smokey eyes.|`|rdB2Pbldaa	1) Apply purple eyeshadow all over your lids, a little past your crease.<br>  2) Apply gold eyeshadow from your inner corners to about the middle of your lid.<br>  3) Add some dark purple from the middle of your lid to the outer corners. Blend, blend, blend everything together!<br>  4) Apply black liquid eyeliner on your top lashlines.<br>  5) Use mascara. (It looks like she used false eyelashes in the pic tho)<br>  <br>  As for the hearts, they are probably either stickers or drawn on with colored liquid eyeliner or cream eyeliner.|`|Drg3bLjUaa	The hearts look like stickers, check out these tutorials on you tube closet match I could find...you dont need to use expensive make up its the way you apply it :)<br>  <br>   <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iNLG5hsc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9J0iNLG5h...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-xm2IUMkz0" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-xm2IUMk...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXddyK8eKoY" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VXddyK8eK...</a><br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob7lQBCFWQw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ob7lQBCFW...</a>|`|c28b58897fec8e58b0165a48d353dd02aa	go to <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blx7bFpQcwM&feature=channel_page" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=blx7bFpQc...</a><br>  <br>  shes got like tons of instructional videos, if you type it in on youtube then I'm sure you can find some. <br>  <br>  This is as close as i could get.<br>  <br>  For the hearts, she probably used a stencil|`|L5nwUNbQaa	put the orange colour on the inner half of your eye to about half way across you lid then the purple on the rest of your lid and up to your brow <br>  <br>  the hearts could be eyeline i dno|`|YJVmL9Ubaa	Good luck,i doubt she did that herself,you'll just have to act like you're coloring a coloring book except on yourself.,better put it on real thick,looks like cream eyeshadow to me.|`|51ebf28f8fd55015dd1aa2e036383229aa	Buy mac makeup and blend.

wgu3RoGCaa	i think they're okay if they are close to your natural color (i.e. the enhancing ones) because that's not much different from wearing makeup to enhance your appearance (it's probably less pathetic than the way some girls cake on cosmetics)<br>  <br>  they're also pretty cool for costume-type fun dress up occassions<br>  <br>  but i somewhat agree that completely changing your eye color is a little weird.  maybe not desperate, but it can seem a little fake.  <br>  <br>  if someone wears color contacts and dyes their hair or something, they probably look nothing like their natural self... i wouldn't be okay doing that|`|3Z4YFz29aa	people who wear them are NOT being themselves and are being fake|`|gXrwqoTGaa	I think they look nice and if someone chooses the right color for their face. Btw, why does it make them pathetic? I guess makeup makes a girl pathetic and so does high heels since the girl is creating the illusion that she's that tall when she really is not. Oh yeah, and don't forget bras, why not just go natural? *Rolls eyes*<br>  <br>  Btw, to the person above me why do you pay $300 for color contacts? My contacts are prescription and my doctor told me if I ever want prescription color contacts it would only be $45 per box of 6 contacts (or 3 pairs). My cousin who has astigmatism pays $160 for hers. So why are yours $300?|`|9vjxfIkYaa	colored contacts can be sexy on a woman, as long as they arent unnatural looking.   guys look really gay with them though.|`|f8QBd5z1aa	I wear a bright blue contact and they are awesome I don't think they re ridiculous at all!

Wscsgyd5aa	I diffuser doesn't take the wave out it keeps the wave in. You have to blow the wave out of your hair with a brush and blow dryer. A diffuser is for someone who has curly hair and wants to dry their curls and keep them curly by laying the hair on a diffuser similar to using a pick on your curly hair
0lewWYJdaa	get a pair of converse.<br>  they wont flap off the back of your feet because they are basically like tennis shoes but more stylish.<br>  just make sure to buy an arch so the shoes dont shape you feet completely flat. if you wear flat shoes for too long, your feet begin to strain and you get back probs,. trust me.|`|hheEB0wpaa	You could get shoes made just for you they will fit perfect and you could tell them to use what ever type of fabric to use for the whole shoe or just for the inside of the shoe so they will fit perfect and feel perfect and you could design the look as well. you could look in the newspaper or at stores in flayers or even online for local stores that make specially design shoes.......also until you can get the specially design shoes you can buy cotton and sick in the sol of our shoes so your feet woun't burn and you can also stick your feet in cold water when you get home from school and stuff........hope thins helps.|`|JyGFPMPqaa	You should try wearing tennis shoes but jazz them up by adding sequins, glitter, and whatever else you like!

Try buying a 7 and stuff some kleenex or something in the toe to make them fit properly. As for comfortable shoes, try buying converse or skater shoes. Everyone wears those and it doesn't matter what your style is you can always find some. If your girly try some pink converse.|`|AA11929713	If money isn't an issue, I suggest checking out some of the higher-quality shoe stores. When trying on shoes, walk around the store a few times to try and determine whether or not they'll be comfortable all day.<br>  Try taking exact measurements of your feet and then buy shoes online. You can always return them if they don't fit right!<br>  Personally, I DESPISE shoe shopping because I have size 11 feet and most shoe stores don't even carry my size! It's terribly embarrassing.<br>  <br>  Anyway, I hope you find luck!

i38Ev1Zaaa	dont comb it! the combs will make your curls all frizzy, and theres no way to fix frizzy curls other than recurling it.<br>  <br>  Hairspray is pretty much the only thing to keep it in after curling it. before you curled it, the person curling your hair should have put mousse, a layer of hairspray, gel, or a combination of the above to keep the curls in all day.<br>  <br>  If your hairs frizzy, just spritz a little bit of the fly aways with hairspray.<br>  <br>  DONT TOUCH THE CURLS- the more you touch, the more they fall out.|`|guxELB16aa	I've been there before....and i learned that don't touch your hair too much, and at night, I reccomend tying your hair in a loose bun so it doesn't get tangled in the morning.

C0HZ8ZB4aa	It's nothing I would have but I think it sounds like a nice idea, and if you like it it doesn't matter what any of us think, and I like the sweet double meaning you have behind it too! <br>  <br>  Just two things to think about:<br>  <br>  I don't know what you mean by small, but if you mean really tiny then you will have trouble getting any detail in on there, and bear in mind what will happen to it over time - very tiny pieces can end up looking a little blob-like after a decade or so.<br>  <br>  And also, unless you're already in a career where visible tattoos are acceptible, just remember that a lot of employers won't employ someone with visible ink on show, so if the design is too big to be covered by a watch you might be limiting yourself to have to wear long sleeves for work.<br>  <br>  If you're okay with that, then great idea! :-)|`|267c2f32faefea8d7cfc0c410537cb2faa	that sounds really cute.

f31691c7cb556d0d74c032f9da6c3696aa	I did my brother's hair all around with a #2 and he likes it.  It's a very short haircut though, and there's really no blending required.|`|C4cV1oIYaa	A #2 on top & a # 1 back and sides is o.k. But if you want to go more extreme a #1 on top & a zero back and sides is quite cool. Better still zero blade all over is a great cut also. If you want to go really extreme, have your hair buzzed on the lowest setting of the razor all over & then get it shaved completely bald with a Mach III razor.<br>  <br>  Really amazing feeling having your head shaved !|`|yzxxYlPyaa	The easiest way is to go same length all over #0  #1 #2 #3 as you wish as long as you make sure it's even all over not leaving unshaved spots. To do that use a hand held mirror to see what you are doing back there and rub your hand all over your head after every two or three strokes of the clipper.
7BVyV4Fdaa	You are going to have to use a bleach with blue in it, like Born Blonde Blue. Which you can get anywhere. Your hair might be really brassy if it's reddish.... so you might not be able to do this all in one step. When you choose the shade of blonde you want for the final step, pick cool colors. No GOLD or WARMER colors. (It will say on the box.)
dM1jwSGyaa	uhm, i personally would wear regular length high top converse but if someone wore that to my grad (i'm in grade eight too) i would laugh really hard. and not because i would be jealous.<br>  <br>  regular length is still fine for making a statement! and tall boots (shoes in your case) + knee length whatever is a big fashion don't. it makes you look really short.<br>  <br>  but if you really like it, don't let me stop you. if you have the confidence to pull it off and won't get crushed by other peoples comments (or laughs, snickers, and flat out jokes), go for it!|`|czAbrzcUaa	If it suits your style then yes, wear them, i think it'd look awesome!

bu6BhCnpaa	ok number one...makeup:  mine takes about 5-6 minutes...and its easy as all get out.  If you really have NO idea how to ut it on, dress up and go to Bloomingdales and get a makeover and see what they do and how they do it.  The go to the drug store and buy a similar product.  I dont like thick makeup...so this is what i do...<br>  I use neutrogena...they have this thing that looks like lipstick but tis a concealer.  I put that under my eyes and on any blemishes.  I tap it so it melts into my skin (dont rub too much, esp under eyes).  then i take the minerals powder and quic rub that all over my face (it comes in this nigty little brush applicator thing so its really fast and easy).  the blush comes the same way and i just put that on my cheeks...not a lot...jsut a touch of color.  then i take a little brush and a light colored eye shadow and sweep across ym eyes lid.  Nothign fancy...but presentable and quick.  most people compliment on how little makeup i wear...and ove tiem you will figure out little kinke that make it faster for you...or try different kinds of eyeshadow or mascara...but you dont have to...i dont unless im going out and im kinda clueless with all fo that.<br>  <br>  as for hair...you could get a straightener, but i personally dont like that look...and its SO damaging to your hair.  My hair is thin and straight...so i have no problems there unless you want volume...<br>  <br>  your situation is simple.  get a really really hydrating shampoo.  NOT herbal essences or anything like that Go for john frida or something a little bit more expensive.  But look for the word HYDRATING or MOISTURIZING.  In the shower...simply wash your hair liek susual and rinse, put in conditioner and leave it for a minute or two while you soap up your body.  If your going to shave leave it on for that too.  Then run your head under the water and as you do that...run a wide toothed comb through your hair starting at the ends and working your way up...you should avoid knots that way and once you get it all combed out continue to rinse till you are finished.  when you get out dry hair with a towel and comb with a wide toothed comb...NO BRUSHES!  Let it air dry!!!  If you cant let it air dry because you are going out and want to style it or you cant go out with a wet head...here is a simple way to dry your hair...<br>  <br>  section off as if you were going to do a half up half down style, but put a little bit more than usual up.  get a circle barrel brush and start at your roots and point the blowdryer at the brush and pull your hair through.  then blow down.  this should straighten your hair without frying it.  Once dry...and it shoudl be pretty straight with a lot of body...put in some leave in conditioner to mae sure the ends dont split too much (i lie ego boost by bed head.).<br>  <br>  good luck hope that all helped|`|0lewWYJdaa	go to youtube and look up makeup tutorials.<br>  they really helped me.|`|lGSbjuIuaa	i would get a streightener and learn how to use it! make sure you get a good one though or it will screw up your hair! and for the make up i would wear some that is very suttle and not to bright. i think some make up is good! just try it!|`|GiWKnF26aa	buy a flat iron and straiten it it only takes about 5 minites and that will help<br>  you could use fake tan or the cream that is soppost to darken up your skin<br>  you could get a total makeover
899N7GM1aa	I have used tail n' main or main n' tail a few years ago because I heard it was good for your hair; I used it but I don't remember it making my hair smell bad. I used the kind found in the drug store so I'm not sure if you are talking about the stuff they use on horses or not. I heard it's the same stuff. If you like the way the shampoo works on your hair but don't like the smell, go ahead and use it and then buy this spray for your hair that gets out odors like cigarette smoke etc... I found the spray at CVS Pharmacy.|`|HNmKgYnUaa	Can you actually use it on a horse... thats my question.|`|U1B9gpntaa	it doesnt smell bad it just feels wierd in you hair when your washing it well it does to me! but i dont think it smells bad|`|Vg0SrHUCaa	No!

7lbc9wqOaa	uhm honestly, its just a buzz cut with no hair on the sides. <br>  its not that extreme of a mohawk. Do your parents know what kind of mohawk you want, maybe they think you want like a big huge standing up one. and last year at my school this on kid got that hair cut and everyone loved it and ended up getting it. so who knows you might start a trend. and as far as what to say to your parents, show them the cut and tell them that you really want it and your old enough now to decide what you want.<br>  <br>  and i agree with the girl above me. you should do that first.|`|PefglUNaaa	dont get a full-on mohawk. start with this one. <a href="http://images.usatoday.com/life/gallery/uncool/mohawk.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://images.usatoday.com/life/gallery/...</a><br>  your parents are more likely to agree. girls will like it more (its HOT) and no one will laugh|`|1xR7Os2Yaa	tell em its the talk of the town and that your fam shouldnt be left out of the mohawky goodness =p|`|wNtBzGGYaa	you shouldnt get one. haha girls dont like it.

SCeIOtZpaa	I am a big fan of getting my hair dyed every six weeks, and from experience I can tell you that temp color does hardly any damage to hair when you compare it to permanent.

6pT6Hd4zaa	When I had mine done I had 4 mates in there with me.... I needed a hand to squeeze when they put that huge needle through my tongue!! So I'm pretty sure you're allowed people in there with you! Although maybe it's different where you live? (I'm from England) But you should definitely have someone there with you, find a new place if that place refuses to let your wife in!<br>  And don't listen to other people, it does look good on guys!! And I'm sure your wife will love it ;)|`|znngp3E0aa	When I got my tongue pierced, I had three people with me. That's five people in the room all together, including myself and my piercer.  The only reason I could think of why they wouldn't let anyone in there is because of space issues, not legality issues. So if you really want her back there with you, just go to a different place.|`|wTfEYPsIaa	Yeah if something like that would happen you would have nobody to help you and that is why I am going to get my tounge periced|`|KLpN10Icaa	dont do it.  not worth it.|`|K8shRjphaa	first of all, i think tongue piercings look bad on guys, second of all, if there professionals then they'll probably let her go back with you, if not, go to a different place|`|Xy7CsbXuaa	I went with my friend when she got her done and i watched, if they don't want you to have someone there with you i wouldn't go to them because that seems weird why they would care so much. Try some place else because it is a serious thing getting your tongued pierced not something that can be done but someone that has no idea what there doing, I think it can paralyze you or maybe even kill you so watch out.|`|YQZoGNOYaa	Of course they let ppl go with you back there, for support. When I got mine done the first time, the piercer even gave my friend and me advice about it, saying I shouldn't squeeze her hand, just hold it because squeezing would cause my muscles to tense. Good luck

61WgRcntaa	You could try using some hair mousse and styling it how you want it to look. Alternatively you could try spraying hairspray undearneath your hair. (hold a section of your hair out and then spray the underside of it)If you tilt your head upside down and brush it and spray some hairspray in it that makes it look more volumised. If that doesn't work you could backcomb the roots of your hair which would hopefully make it have a bit more volume. Or you could use hairspray and backcomb the roots at the same time, so the hair would stay volumised for longer. Or when you wash your hair, you could try blowdrying it, that normally helps.<br>  Hope i helped (:<br>  Sorry if i didnt.<br>  x<br>  Please help me with my question:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AuW0twk1y6Yu.gjYjzqX1BMNxgt.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222135201AAr6sdG">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a> <br>  Thanks :)|`|guxELB16aa	For some awesome major volume, I started to take vitamans E and B every day.

hRf3dSnhaa	if you want free samples, I would check <a href="http://www.sampleaday.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sampleaday.com</a> for it. They are great because they are updated daily and all of their offers are "catch free", that means no long surveys, no pay offers. They also have a e-mailing list where they send you the free samples listed on their site. I use that so I get them in my email (but IT IS NOT REQUIRED TO GET THE FREE SAMPLES). Their descriptions are pretty funny too! If you are looking for a specific type of free sample, there is a categories list and a search bar right above categories so that you can do searches.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh yes if you are from Canada you might like:<br>  <a href="http://www.canadasamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.canadasamples.com</a><br>  <br>  If you are from the UK you might want:<br>  <a href="http://www.uksamples.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.uksamples.com</a><br>  <br>  WHAT I GOT:<br>  I have a full drawer of stuff ranging from makeup to free razors to fish food for my fish pond!|`|jxb00hD2aa	yeh, try <a href="http://www.cashnone.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cashnone.com</a> they always update there list, there page says they are a group of people that do the free samples, and if they get them in the mail they post it on their site, i have tried it, and they work.

I also saw a free sample for make up too, it says something like it is a full size makeup or something like that, im not sure, hey im a guy.|`|jLzRgyoZaa	sometimes they have beauty samples on here...<br>  <a href="http://freesampleforager.com/" rel="nofollow">http://freesampleforager.com/</a>|`|aLojveukaa	umm i dont think so cause then how would they make their money....but eyes lips face has really cheap make-up
ZrM9tCuaaa	my boyfriends mother is always telling me to take it off and paint my nails red or get a french manicure, blah blah blah..tells me black nail polish is only for people who are suicidal lmao.. but shes old and doesnt know my style is classy w an edge. so when she told me she wishes i wouldnt wear black nail polish i recently said " i wish you wouldnt wear that ugly shirt your wearing but at least i have the decency to keep my comments to myself." that shut her up haa :)<br>  <br>  my point is.. i am totally a girly girl, always on top of the latest fashions.. i wear black nail polish.. its like my trademark. its okay as long as you make it look pretty. besides what do you care what ppl think? be yourself. if you like it then you better wear it!|`|CV4bDv65aa	I wear dark nail polish all of the time.  I always leave my toes black.  Also, see how it looks on you.  Sometimes it looks awkward on people with long skinny fingers, or really short and pudgy fingers. (no offense guys)  Also, sometimes pale skinned people look weird with dark nail polish because it looks like their nails are rotting.  (ewwww!)<br>  Anyways, I love black nail polish, and I am a very very very bubbly and happy person :) :) :) :) :)|`|VQlXF8Ucaa	I can't stand it when I see someone wearing black nail polish.  I went on a job interview, granted I am an old lady, but the girl interviewing me was wearing black nail polish and I just thought omg that is so unprofessional.|`|uvYYX1hsaa	Yeah, black nail polish is fine. But, don't wear it if your nails are long. Black and other dark colors (navy, dark purple, brown, etc.) look much, much better on shorter nails.|`|N2akaPXlaa	Yes!

But i really wouldnt recommend wearing it with light outfits, i would, for example, if i had black pants or black boots i would apply black nail polish JUST for that outfit, also, dont put nail polsh on regularily as it can permanantly or temporarily damage your cuticles.|`|GR2XNzCCaa	Yeah, mix it up with bright clothes and it will look cool. Or put pink dots on the black base to make it fun.|`|rcqi6sSfaa	Of course|`|a1566efb5533aa90596e330bc315a547aa	omg would you STOP using that stupid word?!!? why does everyone say that emo crap!?

Don't wear that in the spring, summer, or fall though. P.S. You'd probably look depressed with that on since you always wear bright, cheery cloting.

cyG013twaa	Goodness you're twelve!

My friend had a boyfriend who broke up with her when she started wearing eyeshadow.   Tell those guys to shut up!  As long as your makeup isn't too flashy or you act like a slut, theres no reason for a guy to call you a slut.|`|J8IsPKXGaa	You're twelve. Stop wearing makeup. It's unnecessary. Seriously.
hKfGIzHzaa	You're pretty. But your makeup is ridiculous. Coon tails are horrible. Get some blonde panels or something.|`|5e7ae76d63cef0003f897d4f3907586daa	i don't think you're allowed to say that.<br>  <br>  but can't really tell from the photo.<br>  if i was you, i'd be keeping my hair like it is|`|SLTlvqRlaa	COON tails? wtf?|`|DhPMkORnaa	Firstly, don't say that about yourself. You know you're not ugly.<br>  <br>  Secondly, I'm a pretty big fan of the emo/scene hair myself. However, you should only get it if you consider yourself to be..well, emo or scene. Don't pretend to be something you're not. My suggestion for you is to get side bangs and choppy layers so you can tease it. I advise you not to get coon tails; you'll be bombarded with "poser" comments, and your hair colour already looks nice. <br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|C33jsdydaa	i had a coon tail and i h3114 love it, plus not so many people have them anymore.But you dont really look scene, so it would look odd on you.<br>  <br>  <br>  Since your hair is long you could get those extensions from hot topic if you dont want to damage it.<br>  <br>  but only get one cause too many = tacky|`|eMPmCG9xaa	for one i think your really pretty for two, i think the coon tails look like crap, maybe just some carmle high lights on top and some daker blond on the bottom<br>  <br>  -hope i helped|`|4hr9JGAdaa	dont get coon tails, your hair is going to look ugly and tacky.|`|K8shRjphaa	my hair used to look exactly like thattt! haha, and your super pretty, just to let you know, haha. but what i did, is i got like 3 inches cut off, then i had the underside colored black, because my hair is dark brown, and then i had them razor it up a bit, so the black shows through, it looks good, easy to style, and would look good on almost everyone :D|`|g6KkhHpwaa	Why not just dye your hair one colour all over. Either black, blue/black, red, dark brown, platinum. That'll look pretty and emo. I wouldn't get coon tails though..your gonna have to bleach parts blond and other bits black which could easily go wrong and green. <br>  Why not buy some blonde strip clip in hair extentions and have them cut for your length and then dye them into coon tails using black..that way you won't ruin your hair.<br>  x|`|LZtsKaT2aa	your really pretttyy. you should get a cute 'scene' hair cut. im a fan of coon tails, but not permanent ones. if you want coon tails you can either get clip in ones from hot topic, or you can make your own. you can get hair extensions from sallys beauty supplies and dye them yourself.|`|dixCEiPFaa	my hair was boring. I got platinum highlights. They turned a little orange. Now i have blonde at the tips of my bangs and i like it. I would recommend that.|`|MnkUnbLKaa	its really hard to see from the pic its so dark.  perhaps some red highlights? coon tails= get clip in, its quite tacky. so many emo kids have aweful looking hair!|`|PZegmd3maa	you're not ugly at all, silly :)<br>  Someone else said you shouldn't get coon tails because your not scene enough or something, if you like them get them is what i think. I'm not scene and I have coon tails just because i love them :)  It is possible to have coon tails without doing the whole emo/scene hair thing, I've got no layers and just a side fringe and honestly i don't think it looks stupid at all, neither does anyone I know (and i have very honest friends so i would be told if i look like a moron). <br>  <br>  You look like you have the face to suit like an emo style, although im not sure about highlights if your thinking about blonde, I would go for like bright red 'Highlights' and coon tail stripes if i were you and i think that would look lovely. Also a lot of salons don't do coon tails and have absolutely no idea what they are so make sure they do before you plan anything, I had my friend who works in a salon do them for me at home with some sellotape and she thought i was completely insane as she didn't even know about the concept of 'coon tails' at all :)<br>  <br>  Whatever you chose im sure you'll look lovely x

zAhBlMQLaa	Traditional Mexican clothes are made of silk, cotton, and wool. They are vivid, comfortable, and beautifully crafted. Most Mexican women likes colorful, attractive, vivid dresses. Some Mexican women prefer to wear blouses instead of huipile, a sleeveless tunic which is the most common form of their traditional attire. Some prefer to wear skirts to ankle length but some wants knee length. I think you should go for dress that you know you're comfortable with and that suits for the situation and places that you will be going.|`|ihBWw6W4aa	my church went to mexico and had to do the same thing. They actually wear longer dresses[even though its dreadfully hot]. Its their customs.

sjP1IDILaa	This has been asked before, and my answer is throw them in the dryer.  After I wear my jeans a couple of times, and they start to stretch out, I just toss them in the dryer for about 10 or 15 minutes.  When they come out, they'll be good as new.|`|wDnP5b0Oaa	Thats weird, if you wash them every day they shouldn't stretch. I have some levi skinny jeans and they don't stretch, you could try them.|`|d99448cabbe9c28d7e9269c76839c96daa	wash then then dry them in the dyer and they should get a little snug. works for my panty.|`|DOjztYLHaa	your only supposed to wash jeans every 12 wears. buy some without stretch in them but sometimes they are a little more expensive. try stores like macys, hollister, anchorblue, or you can get designers cheaper at tjmaxx.|`|r1zjX6PAaa	that's how pacsun makes money. you buy jeans that fit good and then suddenly they are too big even if you didn't lose any weight so then you have to buy a new pair.|`|xyW8PsfUaa	after you wash them, put them in the drier and that should shrink them back to their original size, or at least closer|`|zkMHlMeAaa	I have the same problem and the truth is they are going to do this no matter what. The easy solution is washing them until they get tight again, but if they are getting too lose them I would not get a bigger size. I would get a smaller size if anything and they will stretch out after the first time you wear them. I would also try another store besides PACSUN. I have bullhead jeans too, but they do stretch out and not in a good way. You could try RUE 21 or FOREVER 21 They have awesome skinny jeans for 20 bucks. The other thing you could try is not putting them in the dryer and letting them air dry, or before you wear them stick them in the dryer to tighten up the fabric|`|bx0ZZEyeaa	All jeans (all pants, really) stretch out. In fact, the tighter your pair, the more they'll stretch because they have the pressure of your skin pushing against them. <br>  <br>  It's annoying to have to wash a pair of jeans EVERY time you wear them. But, washing them usually brings them back to a normal size. Then they'll stretch out again, then you must wash them. That's just the way it is with jeans. I personally hate this.|`|uvYYX1hsaa	If you will wash them in cold water and then dry them in the dryer on normal, then they should return to normal shape.<br>  <br>  And for future reference, you should only wear skinny jeans twice before washing them. Then wear twice, wash, repeat, etc.<br>  <br>  (P.S. - Macy's has good quality skinny jeans for about $40-$50 a pair. Plus they're really cute!)|`|VpvGzLsUaa	try a different store, if that doesn't work that get bigger sizes (1-2 sizes bigger) but don't worry, they will probably shrink to your size|`|BsKxtMGJaa	try hot topic|`|hahwsMd7aa	try forever21 or zumiez|`|szCv56RRaa	idk<br>  maybe u should cold wash them....give it a try|`|UJbKH9yWaa	my pacsun jeans stretch too so when they get just too big i wash them in warm water|`|FY1yQXioaa	Maybe you washed them in hot water.<br>  Buy a pair of elastic jean, they might be better.|`|gTbDb6CEaa	I have some from Stage and they never stretch out..I love them!

Then you would apply your moisturizer which you rub in and leave on.<br>  <br>  Toner is used for removing left over cleanser, tightening and closing your pores and refreshing your face.<br>  Moisturizer is used for keeping the skin soft. And a good tip before applying make-up is to apply moisturizer first as this gives you a clean, fresh, smooth layer for your make-up to be placed on and you will find your make-up lasts longer and goes on easier<br>  <br>  Hope that helped x|`|itiJVgRsaa	no you just tone, let dry, and apply moisturizer. easy as 1, 2, 3. =)|`|3EqhplpEaa	No that defeats the purpose of the toner<br>  just simple apply moisturizer afterwards.|`|SNCeFeY1aa	no, put it on with a cotton ball, let it soak in for about 7 minutes and then put on moisturizer, but keep in mind that its best not to put toner on really dry parts of your skin|`|G51N3XFsaa	No. You apply toner to the cotton ball, then run the cotton ball over your face, then you're done and can move onto moisturizer.
kdEqMdAxaa	It would look very nice with long leggings, a cardi and plimsolls. If you're worried, you could always wear a long cardi that covers your bum?|`|czAbrzcUaa	How long is it? If it goes over your bum then its fine to wear with leggings, if not then I think its too short, sorry.|`|afedCNrlaa	Yes. It would with some flats or boots that cover the slight bottom of the tights
GFSnJib7aa	Wear lots of leggings. Vicky-T's look is a mix of girly, glam, and a touch of scene. Bright-colored leggings that hit above the knee or halfway down the calf are best. Tights can be acceptable if in the right color, but don't wear them too often. <br>  Wear layers. This includes leggings under shorts (or even ripped jeans, although this is not a staple in Vicky-T's closet.), and vests over or shirts underneath dresses. <br>  Wear big sunglasses. Though they are worn mainly for photo shoots, this will help pull together the look. <br>  Wear lots of heels or flats. Some sneakers are acceptable as she wears them at shows, but Vicky-T is rarely seen in them, so go for a chunky heel (no stilettos!) in solid bright colors. No additional straps or buckles are needed. <br>  Be girly, but not overly-so. Vicky-T wears dresses in a variety of colors often, so stock up on casual solid and patterned dresses. Do not buy maxi-dresses, or mini-dresses. The best length is just above the knee or just below the butt (this look is best with LEGGINGS or TIGHTS!). Do not buy dresses in pastel colors or complicated patterns. A simple polka-dot will do, but not in garish colors.

LawAJfgtaa	I'm thinking about doing the same thing! Only because I'm so small for my age and I might wear 4 inch heels to school every day in the spring.

But the heels will eventually get more comfortable over time. You don't have to wear them every single day but the majority of the days. Otherwise you will never get used to them. <br>  But throwing in a day of flats here and there is not a bad idea to keep the calves healthy and mix up the style.<br>  <br>  You can also try different sizes and different brands of heels. Believe it or not, there is a difference and some are more comfortable than others. Your shoe size may even change slightly depending on the brand! So if this something you are going to be wearing often, make sure you have a good quality shoes and a nice fit.<br>  <br>  I wear heels to school a lot. I love them. Get a lot more attention. They make me feel good, feminine, and has really opened up a ton of options as far as style. And I've actually gotten to a point where I do find them comfortable. But I wear them almost daily.|`|AA10280456	My feet do not hurt at all from wearing heels, but i wear them everyday.

Our skin is naturally made to stand natural elements.<br>  <br>  If you wash/scrub your skin too much, you actually end up damaging yourself and sometimes giving yourself more spots etc because you wash off the natural oils your skin produces to keep your skin protected against bacteria and dirt, and because you lose the oils, your body rushes to make more oil to replace that which is lost, and this can give you more spots. <br>  Spots that do appear as well can even sometimes get inflamed and infected because you've washed off the oils which protect you from bacteria, so now bacteria can easily attack your weakened skin at the weakest point (the spot) which makes it noticeable and such. <br>  Playing with your spots can also sometimes infect them because you have dirt on your hands and fingernails which can get transferred to your spots, which has bacteria, which can inflame them.<br>  And conversely, if you don't wash your face enough, you let oil build up which can trap in dust and bacteria, which can make your face greasy and make spots.<br>  <br>  If you want a clear and soft face, I recommend finding out first what sort of skin you have by going to doctors or researching on the internet, so you can find out how to treat your skin. Also, sometimes it's just genetics so ask your parents or family if they've had the same sort of skin problems as you when they were your age.<br>  <br>  Try to find a natural moisterizer and soap suited for your skin type, and moisterize after washing your face. This helps stop bacteria etc and keeps your face oily (in a good way) so your body doesn't rush around trying to make your oil, then ends up making too much.<br>  If you go to you doctor, or to your pharmacy, they usually have moisterizers specially suited for certain skin types with natural chemicals or chemicals that are safe to use on your skin.|`|yoI3bLuAaa	I've been using this new stuff called, L'oreal Skin Genesis, in a pink bottle.

07YBD5mJaa	If she shaves the hair, it will grow back thicker and darker.<br>  My advice, try lightening them. Lemon juice will naturally lighten the hair, or you can try a bleaching product you purchase at your local beauty store. Lightening them will not get rid of the hair, it will only make them ultra blond so that they are not noticeable.|`|DVXypPKgaa	I would just say to wax them|`|iOYCCaoYaa	I don't really know a whole lot about this at all, but i know a little somthin' somthin' about products!

Tell her I said good luck! Happy late valentines Day!|`|Is3pmbbKaa	Waxing is the best way...it will only hurt for a while. You should tell her to suck it up and just do it...sorry if this sounds really mean I didn't intend it to.|`|0byq7c1maa	shaving works.or if it is soft and doesn't look bad then leave it alone some creepy or desperate guy might like it.|`|SYaSbJb5aa	bleach or wax.  don;t shave tho.|`|bPtOAysQaa	her mom is right. dying them will only make them worse. same with shaving. waxing would be the best way to get rid of the hairs if they really bother her. there are many techniques for helping with pain. you can discuss a few with any waxer, and that may help. also, if they're such a bother to her, then she can discuss with her doctor, or dermatologist the possibility of laser hair removal. it's not nearly as painful as waxing (though still painful) and after only a few appointments the amount of hair that grows in that area will be greatly reduced.|`|itiJVgRsaa	ok her mom is wrong. it will NOT grow back thicker that is bullshit. it's just the bluntness of the hair growing back that makes it feel thicker because it's not fine hair on the tip anymore. anyway, use VEET, it works really great and no pain like waxing. bleaching works great too. bleaching has nothing to do with the hair growing thicker because you're not removing the hair. usually that's from shaving and like i said it's bull. waxing is awesome too but it does hurt but the hairs will be removed from the ROOT and won't grow back for 4-6 weeks at a time. good luck. everyone thinks the hair grows back thicker but they should research it. it's not true.|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Bleach or wax. Only thing with waxing is, it may grow in darker and thicker. Bleaching won't make it thicker, it'll just bleach it. Don't shave it, that will also make it thicker and darker. Or just leave it, I'm sure she doesn't walk around with no shirt, not many people will see anyway.|`|AA12275754	Get some hair removal spray, have her spray it on her belly for the alloted time and then wipe away the hair. Simple as that, or she could get laser surgery and never have to worry about keeping up with getting rid of the hair.|`|BcinqKReaa	she might just have to accept the way she was born cuz waxing,shaving and cutting just aint gone do it if it is gonna gro back all i can say is if it is nappy then perm it and just clip it low but not all off.|`|Asv3t8UNaa	She should suck it up and wax it. xD<br>  But she could use some numbing things beforehand so it doesn't hurt as much.

usxeet5vaa	Since the top is a shade of blue, avoid a blue colored bottom. That really takes away the denim part. You could wear black shorts, though. I think that gray skinny jeans would look good, too, though. Black skinny jeans would work also. <br>  <br>  For shoes, if you're wearing the gray skinny jeans, stick with the regular black ballet flats. If you're going with the black shorts, try converse or vans that are gray. For the black skinny jeans, try beige ankle Uggs. <br>  <br>  If you wanted some color in your outfit, try pink flats, red flats, or white flats. Shiny ones, preferably. Those would go with all the outfits above, I guess.<br>  <br>  For accessories, try just a silver heart chain with a little color. Strawberry necklaces are cool, too. Silver and blue look good, so basically anything silver. Try a white headband for your hair if it's dark. If your hair is light, wear a black one. For earrings, just wear shiny fake diamond studs. <br>  <br>  Try a simple white, black, pale pink, or gray cardigan. If you're wearing the black bottoms, wear a gray or pink one, depending on your shoes, too.

07YBD5mJaa	A disturbing part of the effect of acne is the scar it leaves behind. Our skins can be very humble following the redness and marks as a result of previous acne outbreak. Let me share with you how you can use lemon juice to cure your acne and the scar associated with it. This method can really help speed up the healing process.<br>  <br>  Lemon juice is specie of citric acid. The acid contained in the lemon helps slough off dead skin cells while helping new ones to grow. It also helps to remove excess oil and kill bacteria that cause acne.<br>  <br>  Application:<br>  <br>  Wash your face with warm water or preferably steam clean your face by putting it over a pail of hot water with a towel over your head to prevent the steam from escaping. This will help open up the pores.<br>  Apply the lemon juice with a cotton ball gently (dilute with water if it burns). This will help remove the dirt and oil that have clogged on the skin. Repeat this twice. You may leave it overnight but if you find it too strong for your skin, wash it off after 30 minutes in cold water.<br>  It is advisable you use the method every two days interval until you achieve a desirable result.<br>  Alternatively, you may drink the lemon juice, which works very well for internal cleansing and detoxification of the liver. Squeeze one lemon into glass or bottle and dilute with water. One glass cup before going to bed will do.<br>  <br>  A combination of the two methods will attack acne inside out and give you a good look skin free of acne.|`|AA10628838	Juice the lemons in to a glass container. Pour small amount out in dish and refrigerate the rest. Use a Q-tip and dip into the juice and apply to the acne and scars.|`|itiJVgRsaa	OK listen to me........lemon juice can dry your face out severly if you're not careful. It works like and astringent to close pores and to lighten freckles. however, it does NOT get rid of scars. sorry but that's bullshit and whoever told you that is a liar. lemon juice may lighten your scar cuz that's what it is supposed to do, but that depends on the scar. BIo-oil works awesome for scars and you should try that. I used that on my C-SECTION scar and my scar has completely diminished after having two kids. If you're gonna use the lemons no matter what, then cut the lemon into wedges of four, than apply directly to scar(s) tissue and rub in circular motion. do not rinse off. do this everyday adn youwill see it isn't very effective. good luck. By the way have you really tried everything?? Try dickinson's witch hazel as an astringent and you won't get acne anymore. it removes residue from your face and closes your pores. You have NOT tried everything obviously. do you exfoliate your face so the dead skin is shed off and your face can heal?|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Make sure the surface which you're applying it to has been cleaned. Squeeze 1 teaspoon of lemon juice into a small bowl and use a cotton ball to soak up the juice. If it burns when you apply it, run cool water into the bowl to dilute it. Dab the juice anywhere you have blemishes you want removed. Leave it on over night and rinse it off in the morning. Apply more under your makeup. If you feel it's too strong to leave on, even with it diluted, wash it off with cold water after 10 minutes. Hope it helped.|`|nGoMNd7daa	I tryed that years ago. doesnt do anything. but wen life hands u lemons and the wrong advice, make lemonade!!<br>  <br>  sry i had u tell u doesn't work. i've done many experiments with it.  I'm currently using this new clearasil product called 'Ultra Rapid Action Treatment Cream' It clears blemishes in 4 hours. I LOVE it and im not jus saying that either! Yesterday, i had a REALLY bad breakout, and it was so noticable!! the nex few hours i went 2 check on my face, AND IT WORKED!!!! I'm actually happy 2 say that!!! I can't wait wen it all clears up!!!<br>  <br>  ANYWAY, give up lemons and avocados, and buy the cream.|`|vf5gLYEaaa	lemon juice works?????>?>>>>>>>>>>>????|`|bmbWOGPFaa	Well. I don't know about lemon and acne, but I must warn you about puttin lemon on the skin and go out and take some sun.  When the lemon juice (or lemon components) are applied on the skin and the sun hits you, what you are gonna get is a spotted skin... and it is permanent. So be sure to clean up your skin, just in case...<br>  <br>  Good luck with the acne issue.|`|29f63020a07fba5d54b87def06559b63aa	I just roll the lemon to get it juicy .. cut it open and squeeze in a dish. Get a cotton swab and dip it and rub on my face. If it burns try diluting it with a little water. Leave it on over night and rinse it in the morning. If you think its to strong just rinse it after about 10 minutes of being on your face.|`|BcinqKReaa	try skin id on tv or keep using oil of olay as ur face wash mornin and night then try ponds dry skin cream.|`|cprKsMLsaa	Get some lemons, cut them up and squeeze the juice out into a cup. Wash your face before applying the juice. Dip a cotton ball (don't drown it) into the juice and rub some onto your acne scars. Some people have seen results in as little as a week or two but it might take a few months for older scars. When you're done, put some aluminum foil on the cup and put the leftover lemon juice in the refrigerator.<br>  <br>  Lemon juice is acidic so it will "burn" off your acne scars. It does not bleach your skin. It will hurt and itch like crazy for the first few minutes you apply it. Be prepared for some pain. This is not for sensitive skin. Wash the lemon juice off before going outside.
Xti4iJXQaa	i don't know about blazers....<br>  but vests are amazing! put a cool color vest over a plain white short sleeve shirt with jeans and you have a complete look. or wear black bottoms and a white shirt and a black vest for a classic look.  hope it helps!|`|XWk7TDYTaa	i think so:)|`|EgKR721maa	ya defiantly, i love vest i have 2 of them.

It's price isn't bad either! :)<br>  Good luck, and hope you enjoy whichever one you end up picking!|`|TQfVWzt5aa	They are all cute, but I would say the 1st and the 3rd would be the best choice, although the second one is super cute, It is more like a purse and if you did need to bring books home, they would not fit, I think the 3rd choice would be the smartest (:|`|d9xIDrySaa	its a tie between the 2nd and 2rd!!! i like the 2nd tho.<br>   VERY stylish!!

g6lvm8eUaa	The dress sounds cute but your question needs details. Are you asking what to wear under, or as accessories? Under, try a simple white, satin or cotton slip, or a cute, not-see-through lingerie nightie. The lace detail showing through could be cute. <br>  <br>  Look 1: casual<br>  wear a plain slip. Pair it with cowboy boots, a bright colored head scarf, dangling ear rings, a chunky bracelet, and a denim jacket. carry a big tote bag. wear hair straight.<br>  <br>  Look 2: date or with friends<br>  Wear a lace or satin slip. Pair with black flats and a headband to match. Wear simple silver earings, a few chunky rings, a carry a metalic or bold colored, medium sized purse. wear a leather jacket or a cool, racer-style jacket. wear hair in a ponytail or half updo.<br>  <br>  Look 3: night out<br>  Wear a satin slip. Pair with metallic heals, BIG gold earings,  hair down and wavy. carry a clutch bag.<br>  <br>  hope you enjoy!|`|rohyCK1Maa	well if its white you can really play up bright/metallic accessories. with the sweeping neck thing, i would go with a larger necklace (not rediculous, of course, still tasteful), and maybe a couple of bangles in the same color. If you want some sort of purse with it, i would go for a clutch (because you don't want to put too mutch attention to the sleeves), and agin in the same color family. you could do a monochromatic thing, and just pick tints and shades of a single color, or just do complementary colors (like cool colors or warm colors... stay away from neutrals. they just ruin a white dress). hope this helps =)|`|ykYpv2FLaa	see-through? Ouch. I wouldnt- because number 1- its still winter. and ur not supposed to wear white after labor day. and see though is not attractive. Im wearing a see though white shirt now but i put a black tank under it. I looks better than seeing ur bra though it and black under see though white kinda looks cool to me. But r u looking to put something under ur dress or accessories or what?|`|T8Iin30oaa	wear a bright colored tank top so you can se it through your dress and it will add pizaz.|`|4ie1yCnZaa	to go under try a same color tank<br>  or for shoes dont wear flats try heels or boots <br>  its kinda hard without the pic of it<br>  :))|`|96fTygalaa	Maybe a cute dark color leggings, cute jewelry, and cute flats. Just my opinion!!|`|JefxLLVxaa	jeans? a cami?|`|UghRUnXDaa	try wearing it with leggins and a waistbelt|`|JyGFPMPqaa	Are you serious....|`|K4bJgTF4aa	sounds pretty.  try nice medium heels, pearls, and no leggings...eew...totally out of style.  wear a white camisole and white long undies under it.  you will look like you're taking a walk on the beach.|`|2lzWOi8vaa	Maybe jeans and a tank.

kCdISEGqaa	A 90 word black and white tattoo, that is pretty small?  Do you want to be able to read it ten years down the line?  It's important to know, when you tattoo words on your body, they should be large and in a bold, easy to read font.  Cursive lettering and Old English don't look good over time.  I'm not saying this to be rude, but if you came into my shop asking for a small, 90 word tattoo, I would turn you away.  It's just not something a lot of artists would do.  Tattoos are meant to last and stand the test of time, and when you do something like what you want, it shows poorly after a short amount of time.  Best wishes!|`|CNB7WITFaa	depends on how many letters are in each word. its usually around 5 dollars a letter.|`|CxU4KQTcaa	It wouldn't matter specifically how many words there are, they would just charge you on the general size of the tattoo.<br>  I do suggest getting the letters a decent size as it will blur and become unreadable in the future.
kknSPYxKaa	On average, hair grows around 1/2 to 1 inch a month.<br>  <br>  -If your hair grows slow: 1/2 a month.<br>  .02 mm a day.<br>  -If your hair grows fast: 1 inch a month.<br>  .04 mm a day.<br>  <br>  MAKING YOUR HAIR GROW FASTER:<br>  To make your hair grow faster, I use Mane N' Tail Shampoo and Conditioner.<br>  You can buy it at Sally's Beauty Supply or most CVS's for about 5 or 6 dollars a bottle, depending on where you buy it at.<br>  I have been using it for about 4 weeks now and my hair has already grown around 2 inches.<br>  It is horse shampoo, but it can be used on humans too. So no worries there. It makes your hair thicker, shinier, softer, more manageable, and best of all, it makes your hair grow faster.<br>  <br>  OTHER TIPS:<br>  Flip your hair over at least 3 times a day, to get the blood flowing.<br>  Drink plenty of water.<br>  Get regular trims.(every 6-8 weeks)<br>  Try to keep heat away from your hair, if you can't use a heat protector.<br>  Massage your scalp for 2-3 minutes each day.<br>  Prenatal pills are good for your skin hair and nails!|`|nvq7Z4r8aa	Hair grows about half an inch per month for an average person. For some people, it's a little slower or a little faster.  So, yeah.  Good luck growing it out!|`|VzBLSyfkaa	Hair tends to grow faster in the back then in the front. When you do get your hair cut, I would recconmend only getting about an inch taken off. And ironically, hair actually does grow faster after you get it cut, so getting it cut is actually a good idea.|`|cxzQVRYiaa	I think hair grows at an average of half an inch per month.<br>  <br>  Don't forget to have it trimmed every now and then when you're growing it to keep it in good condition.  ;)
K8UjtbiSaa	Aussie!!! its great, has different ones like -for coloured hair, for lucious long hair, and stuff .. and leaves your hair feeling GREAT :-) x|`|IYu3bBFqaa	yep Aussie is the way to go cant go wrong with Aussie products!|`|Aq0QQnxeaa	I like Aussie 3 minute miracle. I don't know if they make one for colored hair but it still works great!
lfNUHpcEaa	Sorry, If you don't know what to get then you shouldn't get a tattoo. wait till it comes to you, when it does you will know you really want the tat. this is for life! As far as the pain, general rule goes closer to the bone.. more sensitivity, places that are more protected like; inside of your arms, legs,your sides side of your neck,  Everyone has a different threshold of pain so its really hard to say.|`|FDgHnvm3aa	You should get something meaningful and not stupid like "i got a flower cause i like flowers"<br>  <br>  bigger is better<br>  <br>  shoulder/ arms<br>  <br>  something meaningful<br>  <br>  COLOR is AWESOMELY BETTER!!!|`|vYyIpxo9aa	it should be small<br>  and of something meaningful<br>  so you won't regret it|`|CNB7WITFaa	small, on the most fat on your body, little heart,no color.

AA11100991	Actually that sounds perfect. At a couple of graduations in recent years, I have even seen girls wearing flipflops. One thing to remember is that during graduation, the robe stays on. What you are wearing underneath should be comfortable and as dressy as you desire for whatever you are planning to do after the ceremony. Once you have the gown, you can play around with different tops. White or off-white is nice and doesn't have to be boring depending upon the make of the blouse. There may be a shade of blue that might look good under the gown, but without seeing the actual color it's hard to determine. It may be that it would cover the entire blouse so you would be able to choose whatever color you prefer.|`|HAEIpcAraa	It depends on the fabric it's made of, but I would say yes.  You're lucky, when I graduated last year it was required that we wore white, and we weren't allowed to wear heels.|`|JOfW3U5taa	i think thats appropriate :)<br>  thats the same thing i would wear!<br>  i dont think white is boring, its a good colour for your graduation|`|TOYeE0iraa	ya i think that would be really cute! and i dont think the white would be boring at all cuz you have the red!|`|9PD8mTb2aa	No, that all sounds fine! It should be cute, GL and have fun!<br>  ~Aly|`|N5uNgH7yaa	i  wore  a  dress|`|9cMglDUUaa	ya thats fine maybe a white shirt?
usxeet5vaa	Buy new laces- pink ones would look cute. Then, rub off the hearts and peace signs, and take sharpie's and draw on the front of them- the white part. Draw like a tree and birds and a lake and all that stuff. If you're a horrible drawer (like me) ask someone else to do it. <br>  <br>  Or if you don't want to do that, have you're friends sign the white part. Or just glue on rhinestones that are pink (that looks good with black) onto the white rubber part, covering it. For the black cotton part, you could take whatever color fabric, and stich it onto some parts so it looks like patches. You can also take a black sharpie or some other color, and draw on dots on the laces. <br>  <br>  Draw on different designs. Tye-dye the fabric. Color the white part neon colors. Draw prints on the white rubber part like zebra stripes, polka dots, tigers stripes, leopard spots. Really, be creative and do anything that comes to your mind. You never know, just a simple color could look really good!   <br>  <br>  Of course, don't do all these ideas. That would just be too much! Try combinations that you think would look good, and place everything first- don't glue until you know that's what you want. If you don't want to mess up if you draw, then draw in penil first.<br>  <br>  HOPE THIS HELPS!|`|jX4Byb6Eaa	ohhh, you should go to a hobby shop and get some model paint and fabric paint. you should paint the fabric part of the shoe in the color of your choice (i'd probably go with a dark red), then paint the white parts of the shoe with metallic model paint in a lighter version of the color that you painted the other part with (in my case, metallic magenta). <br>  you could even paint your laces to match your shoes or pick another color all together!|`|F6Ye0El8aa	you should doodle on them, like what some people do on deviantart. =]<br>  or, you could right like.. your nickname on the side... o.o<br>  ORRRR you could.<br>  try and dye them a tye dye colour :O|`|xyW8PsfUaa	Why dont you color the white part in with a bright color or draw zebra print on it
AA10098448	Well, why can't you go to all of the stores? You don't need t follow a type of trend, you can create your own!!|`|LdEVL5Bcaa	dont leisten 2 anyone who says abercrombie, hollister are too expensive--meybe some clothing pieces are, but i speak from years of experience: hollister and abercrombie make clothes w/ really good quality. <br>  <br>  So you could mix and match from these stores while going to aero and AE just so your looks dont appear too overused.|`|HAEIpcAraa	Try a little of each and be interesting, instead of just shopping at one store.  Make it interesting!  Buy what you like and not what you think you should to fit in.|`|AUpJwKAKaa	u look like a hollicrombie kind of person|`|adW8pOMdaa	If you're not satisfied with your style now and want to change, I would not suggest getting into the A&F or Hollister trend because they are pretty expensive. If you are looking for a cheaper, but still good quality look for a pre-teen/younger teen, then try Aeropostale. Pacsun is a good store for jeans. Forever 21 is good too, but it depends on how developed you are because it's more of a teen store, but if you like it and fit it, then it doesn't matter. :)

b3892e48ce1ff2d86e671ceef5fd7a83aa	With mine- I had redness that wouldn't go away, plus it was a little hard and wept a little, sometimes there was a dot of yellow pus, right from the beginning, and no matter how scrupulously I cleaned everything- with the salt soaks in hot sterile water, etc, it kept getting a little worse, and worse, until finally I went into a walk in clinic and the doctor put me on antibiotics. It also hurt or stung sometimes to stretch the muscles around my belly button. I kept waiting for it to heal but it just never ever did!

awskuSGBaa	Wait for your 18th. It is worth it.|`|kCdISEGqaa	NO!!!!!!  It's illegal, and artists can lose their licenses if they do it.  Even if you did find someone who would go with you to hide it form your parents, and that's legal in your state (only five states allow it), the shop would require that the person bringing you provide documentation that they are your parent or legal guardian.  Just wait, you'll be glad you did.  Adults don't get tattoos because they're cool.|`|zRZKdH1Zaa	In Canada it's usually 16 with parent permission and 18 without.<br>  I know for other places it's usually 18 though and they won't tattoo anyone under.<br>  <br>  And no, you can't go with someone that's not your parent.  Period.|`|1Thb8v1yaa	you have to be 18 to get one. <br>  <br>  and usually if your not a lot of places neeed documentation of your relationship with the person you bring with you. birth cirtificate, court ourder, etc, etc./|`|FDgHnvm3aa	yeah, there are only a few states that will let you do it under 18, and even then, the only artists that will do them probably aren't ones that you want modifying your body.  Its better jsut to wait|`|NhOQ3mRxaa	I don't know it is diffrent in all states!<br>  Faith Trust & Pixie Dust,<br>  Chelsie|`|U7mP7Rw9aa	Depends on what the state your in says..I live in Nebraska and I went up to Lincoln when I was 16 last year and got a tattoo but I had to have an identification of my birth and my parents and they had to give me permission. So it really depends on where you live and what sum tattoo places say.

yJSPecgoaa	It's perfectly okay to get a facial whenever you want, without having to keep going back for them.  The results are certainly *better* if one is able to go every month or so, but it is not required.  Even after one facial, your skin will glow and look lovely for several days afterwards, so go and enjoy.<br>  <br>  In large metropolitan areas here in the states, facials tend to start at $75, but they are considerably less in outlying areas.  Good luck.|`|jNpW0iTWaa	it depends where you go to get it. if you already know of a place you want to go, see if they have a website that shows prices. if not, just go to there store and ask how much a facial costs. <br>  <br>  :)|`|xyW8PsfUaa	It will work, but your skin wont stay like that if u dont get one frequently.

BAPj9JW3aa	No, it doesn't hurt...on a scale of 1-10 i'd say about a 2.....since you've had your nose pierced(i have too), that hurts 100 x's worse than tongue......when youre getting it pierced you can just feel the pressure of him shoving the needle through, but it doesn't "hurt"...swelling is *****!! i actually wanted to take mine out the second day of having it done...mostly out of frustration of not being able to eat anything but chicken broth.....on the 3rd day i managed to suck down some ramen which was really nice! it's definitely weird getting used to, but if you wanna get it done..i say go for it!!!<br>  <br>  as much as people on here maytell you to eat ice cream..DON'T!<br>  youcannot have ANY dairy products during your healing process because it can cause a yeast infection....stick to crushed ice, soup, and jello, applauce....easy foods....no solids...<br>  be sure to also avoid spicy foods, alcohol, smoking, french kissing, and giving oral for the first 2-4 weeks.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  healing can be different for everyone so it really varies as far as how much you'll swell up, and how soon you can eat.<br>  <br>  <br>  be sure to eat a HUGE meal before going to get it pierced, if you decide to do so....i made the mistake of eating nothing but half a chicken sandwhich the entire day i got it pierced and spent the next week miserable of hunger...take a tylenol or ibuprofen every few hours to maintain swelling/pain. ohh and everytime you put anything in your mouth other than water and ice rinse your mouth out with a alcohol free <br>  mouth wash.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  good luck!|`|6pT6Hd4zaa	I got mine done about 3 years ago. It hurt quite a lot but nowhere near as much as I expected it too. They pierce it with quite a long bar as your tongue will swell up quite a bit, and then you can change it to a shorter one after a week or two.It's difficult to eat for a few days so stock up on soup and ice cream. Sucking ice may also help with the swelling. I was told to rinse my mouth with salt water about 4 times a day, and after eating or drinking anything.<br>  You're not meant to smoke, kiss or drink alcohol for a few weeks after its done either.<br>  And about the noticing it, if you see people when you've just got it done they'll probably notice because you won't be able to speak very clearly :p But once it's completely healed, most people won't notice it really. Mines only really noticeable when I laugh, but that all depends on how far back you have it done.<br>  <br>  Hope that helps! x

v90vFco1aa	It's hard to say whether or not it's infected or beginning to be. But you're good with the sea salt soaks, it sounds. Just make sure you're going them for about 10-15 minutes at a time with like a cotton ball, as a opposed to a qtip.<br>  <br>  Another thing you can do is make sure to hold your ear under the water when you take a shower. The reason for soaks is because cartilage doesn't get much blood flow and the warm water stimulates blood flow or something, aiding in the healing process. And the sea salt just draws out dead cells. So when you take a shower just hold the piercing under the water for like 5 minutes at least. It should help as well.<br>  <br>  Make sure you're not playing with the earring other than cleaning it and that you're keeping your hair away from it also. All these natural oils and stuff can make an unwanted reaction. <br>  <br>  If it does get worse, and you start to see a whitehead-like discharge, or any kind of non-clear discharge (I think some might be normal?) then you should probably see your doctor. A round of antibiotics and maybe some topical ointment will clear it right up. Make sure you don't take it out if you're afraid there's an infection because the piercing can close and trap the infection under the skin. So see your doctor first if you're really concerned. <br>  <br>  Hope I could help!|`|BRISyG77aa	i had mine done beginning of december  '08  & I  had the same problem but just keep at it & the bleeding will stop soon <br>  just try not to knock it or sleep on it<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  happy piercing|`|f8v7Zbkzaa	Iv had mine done for 2 weeks yesterday and mine was the same way. <br>  <br>  the top is still really sore.

7zrsIK9Paa	no.. it looks so healthy and strong..<br>  My hair is way worse.|`|WDbE5gffaa	Noo, it doesn't look damaged.<br>  It just looks like you straighten it. Straightening hair, over the course of a month or so, will start to fry the tips of the hair. <br>  Personally, i like that kind of look on hair, the ends poking out a bit. But all you need to stop that is get a trim. You don't need to lose any length on your hair, just like a half cm trim.|`|K8a3a6PNaa	you need to let it breath! Your hair is naturally very fine and not thick at all. You need to stop styling it day to day because you are shrivelling it and what little hair you naturally have. I have thick to wavy hair and my mom has fine hair unlike my dad. My mom's hair is very smooth and pretty looking. She barely does anything to it that is why it is in that state. You should start using better deep conditioners from brands like bedhead, redken, and catwalk. If you use other products like hairspray stop! Atleast for a while. Don't straighten your hair anymore then 2 times a week or only for special occasions or outings. Put your hair up for a while now.. Do it up for like a whole month. Let it revive itself. Stop cutting it as welll! Everyone says that trimming it brings it to life, but your problem is that you cut it way to much especially in short layers which makes the hair way more apparent when it's damaged. Your hair is already fine and girls get layers to thin it out, so stop thinning it out with layers! Let your hair grow out and don't ask for layer cuts anymroe except maybe a bang touchup. Growing out your hair will make it look thicker. After like 5-7 months of growing it get a very small trim to cut off the dead ends. Other then that don't get it layered anymore! Leave-in conditioning serums will make the damage less noticable. Ralph lines have great leave-in serums that will make it look smoother and healthier. <br>  <br>  Blow drying is no where as damaging as straightening so if your gonna use a blowdryer use it in a cool setting. It's also possible to straighten your hair with only cool air setting blowdryer+brush. Just when you get out of the shower take a brush and as your brushing it downwards follow each section with the blowdryer and you'll be suprised how straight it will come out. Redo each strand like 6 X just don't get to close with the hair dryer stay atleast 1-2 inches away from the hair while using it. Basically it's the same idea as straightening each strand, just you don't press the blowdryer into your hair.<br>  <br>  PS Make sure your hair is wet while your blowdrying it straight!<br>  <br>  Try that & good luck!|`|4fded85bb017fba5407e3727176079ffaa	It doesn't look damaged as such.  Maybe split ends but not terrible.<br>  <br>  It's a lovely color so don't dye it.  It would take years, if ever, to get it back to your natural color.  Plus, the damage would be horrific (I should know).<br>  <br>  Whatever you decide to do with the style, such as straightening, use a product on it that protects it from heat.<br>  <br>  Also, find a good LEAVE IN conditioner and use once a week.<br>  <br>  Do not use Suave at all.  Try Pantene if you can afford it.  Buy the type that is right for your hair.<br>  <br>  If you can stretch it, go to a salon and buy Matrix hair mask.  It is awesome!<br>  <br>  Anyway, good luck!  Your hair is lovely!|`|HIwJFtNlaa	yes, it lokos damaged.<br>  Try to keep your straightening to a minimal, I used to have really damaged hair and what I did is stop straightening it, and condition it very well every day.<br>  I use leave-in conditioner by Wen<br>  <a href="http://blog.seenon.com/files/imported/wen_hair_care.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://blog.seenon.com/files/imported/we...</a><br>  <br>  the second to the left. It works really well (:|`|AyHp9Yzzaa	It looks like the ends are getting fried. Don't straighten or blow dry it, and you should use Herbal Essences Dangerously Straight shampoo.<br>  :) good luck.|`|Iyvt7ibmaa	yeah, it does look a little damaged, but that's what happens to everyones hair! I'd get it deep conditioned at a hair salon, these can cost anywhere from 10 to 30 dollars, but they'll make your hair look and feel amazing! After that, I use Tresemme shampoo and conditioner, which works really well. However, make sure to switch shampoos and conditioners once a month, because your hair will get used to the shampoo's chemicals, and the initial satisfaction you get will wear out, so change it up once a month! When blow drying, you can get a leave in conditioner and an ionic blow dryer, which blows cool air instead of hot, so it doesn't fry your hair out. With straightening, there's a product that acts as a spray in barrier for your hair that will protect it as your straightening. I forgot the product's name, but that definitely works, so I would suggest going to a salon and asking, or googling for more information.|`|P4mPoSJ9aa	I don't think it looks damaged, but try not to straighten it as much. That's what truly damages your hair.<br>  <br>  If you like it curly, I recommend Tresseme Shampoo & Conditioner for curly hair.<br>  <br>  Once you get out of the shower, put some gel in your hair once it is is damp. Then use a diffuser [an attachment to the hairdryer] to blow dry your hair, That would be best for curly.<br>  <br>  As for straight, I honestly wouldn't know, because I have curly hair.<br>  <br>  But, good luck!|`|eJSl42iVaa	only a bit<br>  <br>  but to prevent more damage you should not straighten it at least 2 days out of the week. and deep condition it once a week. i use tresemme smooth and silky deep moisture mask and it helps a lot. dont wash the ends of your hair. it will dry them out. wash the roots, then condition all over, concentrating on the ends. it makes the ends not split and break easily.|`|NuPwR75Jaa	i think L'Oreal elvive nutri-gloss is really good. It does what it says. (: .. and yeah if you don't straighten it it will start to be less dry. But it will take about a week or 2 before its noticeable. (:|`|m0kdllZZaa	Not really... a little though. Just lay low on the straightening and stuff.. just do it like twice a week. Try to use the special shampoo and you'll be fine.|`|VtJ5kRgIaa	use pantene pro-v and lay off the straightening|`|3JO8pF1Baa	try scrunching your hair<br>  and let your hair air dry

The best way to bring out your eyes is to use the opposite shades.  Hazel is a combo of a little green with brown, so blue will really make them pop.  That doesn't mean you have to get the brightest blue out there.  If you want a smoky look, take an angled brush with dark blue shadow right along the line where your lashes meet your lid.  Then you a medium to light color on the lid.|`|M3pufPlnaa	My favourite is Natural Collection!

Rj08Nzv9aa	get it blown out at the hair salon or get your hair relaxed/permed<br>  (for blowing it out dont get it wet) (for perming, just take good care of it)|`|IYu3bBFqaa	invest in a straightener|`|BtK9nSalaa	for non frizzy hair and great curls:<br>  <br>  try following these steps:(if showering b4 bed)<br>  <br>  when in the shower only use conditioner<br>  <br>  comb wet hair, DO NOT BRUSH, then scrunch with hands<br>  <br>  put a cream or mousse ( i like suave professionals anti frizz cream, its<br>  2.00), gel's kinda gross, in<br>  <br>  let air dry or blot with t- shirt, don't touch or brush, for about 10'15 <br>  minutes. towels make it frizzy<br>  <br>  put into a bun (high) then go 2 sleep<br>  <br>  when waking up take bun out scrunch only with hands, don't brush<br>  <br>  brushing ur hair just takes the curls out and makes it poofy. <br>  <br>  i did this once, yesterday, and my hair looks awesome<br>  <br>  if i do say so myself<br>  <br>  i use suave or V05 conditioners, they're like 1.00, try adding honey sometimes for more moisture and shine<br>  <br>  it never gets old leaving it down ;D|`|xEyB4JiKaa	you could go to a GOOD salon<br>  abd get a perm,(a straight perm) for about $100 to $200<br>  depending on your hair texture, and it is NOT permanent as <br>  many people mistake it is, and it is for ALL ethnic groups <br>  the perm will last up to 3 to 4 monthes if you take proper care,<br>  but only bad thing of this is, it could dry your hair out pretty badly,<br>  and it will get damaged to the point where your hair will get split ends on daily bases.<br>  <br>  but if your still wanting to perm your hair for the convinience, because everymorning it is completely hastle free, but it costs just way to much for you, you could go to ulta and get one of those do it your self kits that require super harsh chemicals to straighten out your hair.<br>  you could just ask the cashier about the self perm kit and they'll get it for you. But I DONT recommend it.<br>  <br>  and as many people said, you could straighten your hair everyday <br>  which will damge your hair anyways, <br>  well, from my expiernce you can not alter your hairs texture fully to your extent unless you damage it somehow.<br>  <br>  Good luck !:)|`|RkIgHyRCaa	Check out <a href="http://www.naturallycurly.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.naturallycurly.com</a> for lots of great info about curly hair!|`|jZguzD2Raa	Straightener!|`|XqmJKlmwaa	...???!!!|`|ohHKylkPaa	OMJ! dude i have like the exact same hair, big, thick and curly! and trust me its funner than you think once you get to styling it, curly hair is actually very romantic hair. so what i do when i dont straighten it is i get out of my shower than i just let it dry normally then what i ussualy do is when im styling it i scrunch it with gel, Sepreate my bangs from my hair (if u have bangs) than put a cute lil headband in it! aalways works for me! <br>  hope i helped!|`|7oAJUIl0aa	you can get a straightening solution put on it by your hair dresser, it worked for me!|`|aJ4cjsCuaa	Go to the salon (a good one) try changing from the usual place you go because obviously they are not helping!

TQfVWzt5aa	You could search for a salon.. most do it, but what you need to do is get it chemically straightened.. It won't last forever, but you can get it re-done, I recomend that you don't do it though, it will dry out your hair and dammage it. Even a regular straighter can do that. Be sure you are using a hydrating shampoo.|`|6Tx8Opmraa	A salon...|`|cWwmNAhwaa	You can't. You either have to have natural straight hair or you just have to keep straightening it with a straightener.

You are pretty enough to pull off most any hairstyle, but i really mean it when i say that getting bangs would be no mistake! If you choose to get side bangs, then i suggest to blow-dry your bangs before the rest of your hair to keep them from waving or denting from drying naturally. My favorite product for my bangs and the rest of my hair is Ojon Ultra Hyrdrating Shampoo! It's truley amazing and keeps my hair in perfect condition, even the day after i wash it.

nGoMNd7daa	WOW, I'm not suprised that u have redness spots. u use 2 much products. ur skin is used 2 Physicians Formula Foundation, so thats not it. but the baby OIL. notice how i caps that. Oil is blocking ur pores. Then u go 2 sleep, which is wen u gain the most oil. Then u use the egg/lemon mask. lemons are sour, and eggs rot in ur pores (i know gross) ur skin must a lil too delicate 2 handle all of that. <br>  <br>  Here's wat u should limited ur skin routine 2: <br>  cetaphil face wash (btw, i luv cetaphil)<br>  and the foundation 'till ur face heals up.|`|itiJVgRsaa	Let your skin breathe. lol. and then exfoliate the dead skin off with warm water to open pores so other products can be more effective. can't penetrate if there is dead skin. also after washing/exfoliating your face with a mild cleanser/ exfoliant, then use witch hazel to tone. it not only tones, it gets rid of any residue left behind by your cleanser, and closes your pores. follow up with an OIL-FREE moisturizer. no more baby oil ok. do this daily, and it does work. go light on make up too, foundation can be suffocating to the pores. good luck.|`|bPtOAysQaa	the redness left behind is just the skin being irritated. keep it moisturized (with an oil-free facial moisturizer) and wear sunscreen all the time (even on cloudy days). eventually the redness will go away. also, if you've been using this mask every night, or close to, you may want to ease up a bit. your skin is sensitive and may just need a little break. you may be hesitant to stop for a day or two because you've been getting such great results, but your skin may really need it. good luck|`|3EqhplpEaa	Yes you should stop wearing makeup.<br>  atlest less of it. One, you're still young so embrace your youthful skin and two, makeup everyday can be very stressing to the skin.<br>  For a natural remedy try Aloe Vera. Aloe Vera can be very calming to the skin and it heals any spots or acne you have. 30 Mins before bed try cutting up the Aloe Vera plant into thin strips. The juice is what you really want. and yes it will be very slimy and slippery.<br>  but put it on your skin and it will dry within 5-10 mins. reapply if necessary.<br>  Doing this 3-5 times a week will help alot, your skin will glow also. cause i do it every night.<br>  <br>  However if you dont have the patience you could try clinique's reddness solution line. I used it once before as a sample and it helped.<br>  <br>  <br>  and for less makeup. if you want coverage but not the heavy feel of foundation, you should try a tinted moisturizer. Tinted moisturizer moisturize skin and acts like a light foundation by enhancing your skintone. I dont have a specific brand in mind, because I dont use it much. but i have friends who uses it and it looks great. <br>  Try going to Sephora and asking one of the workers to help pick one out for you.
itiJVgRsaa	do not ever use ANY lotion on your face that isn't specifically for the face. it is too oily. also, it should be an oil free moisturizer for face. medicated would make it sting too. to treat your acne use a mild cleanser like cetaphil or almay. use hot water to open pores. then use  witch hazel to close pores and tone your skin. it really works. it removes residue left over by the cleanser and closes your pores. Try dickinson's that's what i use. then, use an OIL-FREE moisturizer to moisturize your face. don't do anything else. it's all gimmicks and none of that acne crap actually works. vitamin e oil clogs pores and aloe does work but it doesn't prevent it from returning.

FfNjsqGvaa	I would think that you would just put in gel and mousse and than mess it around until it looks right. Than let the gel set. I have never done it before, but I am pretty sure that is how they do it|`|Xj4JLlcEaa	use hair products<br>  like mouse and wax<br>  and mess up your hair<br>  thats what i do and its very awesome :D|`|hVZkMkqVaa	well, you sort of need longer hair to do this, but if you don't have longer hair, you can still pull it off with some variation of the steps below:<br>  <br>  1. Take a trip to the barber, tell him/her to give you choppy layers. Try printing off a picture to show to them. I like this one: <a href="http://www.hairfinder.com/articles2005/loreal2005pictures/antonsteele.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hairfinder.com/articles2005/l...</a><br>  <br>  2. Then, buy a good hair gel (you can ask your barber for recommendations, but i have a few ideas of my own)..try Zach's Wax, H2 Hold, American Crew Fiber, Bed Head Gels, Elasta Mens Wave and Styling Gel, American Classic Firm Hold Gel for Men, or Beyond The Zone Gels. Try this site for others: <a href="http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware.store/Sites-SA-Site/default/Search-Show?q=men+hair+gel" rel="nofollow">http://www.sallybeauty.com/on/demandware...</a><br>  <br>  3. After you shower, while your hair's still damp, put in a little bit of the gel, and then mess it up with your fingers. Then blowdry. The end result should look similar to this: <a href="http://www.hqman.com/images/pages/bedh-men-mainbody.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.hqman.com/images/pages/bedh-m...</a><br>                                         OR<br>  <a href="http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/images/quiz82/405342/405342_res5_randy.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://content2.myyearbook.com/zenhex/im...</a><br>  <br>  good luck!<br>  :D|`|62be786303441afb98f02bd29c42ef1daa	What I'd say is that you ask for the ends to be razored into a look where none of the ends are really the same length.

9ccCHZHgaa	Well if you're a guy, you can expect to grow a little bit taller... There's a chance you might reach 6 foot.<br>  If you're a girl, you probably reached your max. height.|`|dzbblpjgaa	It is usualy genetic and could appear several generation down the line. So your Grandparents may be a gauge to your final height. Just relax - unless you hate shopping  - for even more new clothes ;)|`|bPtOAysQaa	it all depends. typically, you get your growth patterns from your grand parents. so, if you're a girl look at your grandmothers, and if you're a boy look at your grandfathers. you'll probably be similar in height to one of them. as for how much longer you should expect to grow, again, look at your grandparents. you can typically get a good idea from when they stopped growing.|`|0e7167a6d9a97c62e2b332564405b69daa	Depending on when you started menstruating, you could be at your height now...lucky you!!!

Monroe's look like silver pimples sitting in the middle of your face. I have never seen someone pull them off. <br>  Lip rings are okay but your face is already so pretty it would just detract from it. Lip rings accent the persons lips and your lips are perfect for your face. It would make them stand out too much. <br>  <br>  If you wanna do something just get another ear piercing or a tongue ring or some other body ring. Your face doesnt need anything!|`|DSNlt2h0aa	Monroe, definitely. :)<br>  Lip rings are rougher looking people :P|`|7tRTZhnLaa	I think you should get a monroe piercing. Not a lot of people can pull them off but you could, which is lucky for you!|`|C0aMI33Naa	i think you could definitely pull of a monroe.|`|Asv3t8UNaa	Monroe!|`|JWDfOTX2aa	Monroe(:|`|WOsd2lDzaa	lip piecing is hotter,<br>  monroe piercings look like moles|`|jI2j3wd8aa	monroe|`|pxTsBlOMaa	monroe|`|afedCNrlaa	Monroe totally. With some shiny lip gloss you're good to go.|`|aSso3n7oaa	Don't get either.|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Monroe, if you really want a piercing.. the lip piercing would look slightly ridiculous on you. Monroe would look cute, though. Nose, too. Just make sure you keep it clean and the bar they give you, don't be stupid and change it. It's a long stud for a reason, it hurts like a ***** when you have a bar that's too short. Plus, you'll have a huuuge lip with a shorter bar. Speaking from experience. I have snakebites, but all my piercings except my bridge and ears were done by a friend. Just take care of it =]|`|dRpcwZcdaa	lip or monroe... both would suit you i think
NpyNm8tPaa	the easiest way is to print the picture, go to the hairdresser, show them the picture and then they will cut it the way it is in the photo. Don't try to cut it yourself though, too risky.
bIjI8BTBaa	welllll im brunette, and i want to try blonde someday, but its so much harder than going from blonde to brunette, so in a way your lucky to be born blonde! plus brunette suits everyone whereas blonde doesnt<br>  <br>  so if i were you id stay with blonde, apparently there more attractive because blonde is more rare.... but its up to you :)
1xwyCxdUaa	It doesn't hurt badly when they do it, but it will hurt after.<br>  <br>  The pain goes away within a few weeks as long as its not infected.|`|KVBTtF9faa	It feels like a pinch, it's not bad.|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Honestly, piercings depend on how high your pain tolerance is. None of my piercings hurt a bit, and I have 8. I don't have my belly done yet, but I'm getting it done twice. Plus tons of other piercings. The worst part about all piercings would be when they actually put the ring through. The only thing you feel with the needle is a little prick, like a bee sting. Then, slight pressure when the ring is going through the wound. They'll tell you to clean it, and not wear tight clothing. Make sure you do what they tell you, and you'll be fine =] Good luck, by the way.|`|frF7YaSyaa	I got mine done on my 13th birthday! I am the biggest chicken in the world when it comes to needles lol and the only thing that hurt and I felt was the clap they use to pull the skin out so they can pierce it but that's it. Hop this helps and relaxes you!|`|BmB6h2Bdaa	Well, it doesn't really hurt, it just stings a lot while it's being done, and then it hurts for a few days after wards with sitting down and crouching and stuff. Just make sure you get the anti-septic spray or whatever so it doesn't get infected! (:  xxx|`|CdrqrcLIaa	my ear lobes hurt worse!<br>  belly is the least painful place.<br>  feels like a toothpick poked u
bPtOAysQaa	no, they're not permanent. however they may take a little while to go away, the peel probably went a little deeper there. keep it moisturized and protected from the sun and it should be gone soon.
iu4SOin3aa	Honestly, I dont think that would look very good.<br>  I would suggest goin to a salon where they can match your root color up with a dye color, then you can grow it our and not have to worry about it being two different tones.|`|DJK8yUbAaa	yes mam!

Then pair it off with some sexy, flowy clothing, and there you go! Practice the sexy eyes thing - it will help. :)|`|bit5P4Dwaa	the link won't work but i'd advise you to do a cute but siggestive smile where no teeth are showing to achieve a "sexy innocent" look.<br>  also LOTS of eye contact!!! to make it EXTREME!!lol|`|MbFS6XFQaa	No such thing<br>  <br>  "sexy" means sexually appealing.<br>  <br>  Now tell me, is they're anything innocent about sex?|`|zxdBAJNEaa	Take em naked

It suits you.
Qa0sXoqqaa	Go for it! <br>  <br>  & do not be scared :[<br>  <br>  Question 1) Does it hurt? - I'm really confused why loads of people are saying it does. I, personally think it's exactly like getting your lobes pierced. I know everyone has different pain tolerances but it really is not bad at all. I felt a quick pinch, and nothing more apart from after wards, when I was cleaning it.<br>  <br>  Question 2) Where is the best place..?  - I got mine right on the curve or my ear at the top. Well, I got my first one there anyway. I have three altogether on the same ear. But the one of the curve of my ear has healer the fastest then any of them. So, perhaps there.<br>  <br>  Question 3) What ear should I get it pierced on? - Are you left handed or right? If you are left handed, get it pierced on your right ear, because you'll sleep on your left side, and if you get your left ear pierced, & sleep on your left side, it'll disturb the piercing and hurt too. <br>  <br>  Question 4) Stud or Hoop? - Stud, because hoops get tangled in EVERYTHING! :[<br>  <br>  P.S, don't be scared when people say it hurts. If you really are discouraged by that matter, then speak to your pierced before you get it pierced, and maybe you could also numb it with ice cubes.<br>  <br>  x|`|1Fyn7716aa	<a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AqzX5tAZFHqmLh85d.HyIlfsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222091013AAr5is6">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|7fPCeO8Daa	if your a dood peirce the right ear, girl you peirce either ,and no it doesn't hurt that bad i did mine by myself and it didn't hurt that bad|`|3i427B3raa	i was with my friend when she got it. she said that it wasnt that bad, it just stung a little. ohh and get it peirced on youir left ear : )|`|CzUTBx1Aaa	it takes longer to heal i think|`|n2toGLaYaa	ouch. i've heard that's the worst....<br>  ummmm idk. i'd reconsider.....|`|nETw4eOKaa	it doesnt hurt at all.<br>  i promise.<br>  its like a pinch,<br>  and i got my left side done|`|jFYwSQQeaa	I had this done twice about 13 years ago.<br>  Does it hurt? not really, just like getting your lobes pierced.<br>  I got mine pierced just where the top of your ear starts to "curl" over.<br>  I found it healed faster and was easier to keep clean because its a "skinny area" of your ear.<br>  I would recommend getting it pierced on the side you do NOT sleep on ( if you sleep on your side) or not on the side where you use the phone.<br>  It can be sore as it heals and you want to be as comfortable as possible.|`|Ou3rGsYkaa	I have my left ear pierced right at the top<br>  i really like it, and it doesnt hurt too much<br>  what i mean by too much, is that its kind of a short, sharp pain<br>  im a wimp, but its so quick that it doesn't bother you, honest<br>  the pain lingers for a bit after, but trust me, it's not so bad<br>  the only problem i'd say with it is that it's quite uncomfortable to sleep with, but mines all healed now, so i dont sleep with it in anymore anyway<br>  but that might just be me<br>  good luck!|`|Q37YNI68aa	There will seriously only be a second of pain.  and that is right when the needle goes through the cartilege...

hrU14wMDaa	I am your average upper-middle class suburban mom in the US, so take this as you will. Personally, I welcome my children to experiment with their hair and style. My only rule is that they have the best grades they individually can attain, treat their parents with the utmost respect, follow house rules and have good friends. NO drugs and NO drinking.<br>  <br>  You need to present your parents with the facts about dreadlocks. There is great information at www.dreadlocks.com. You should also realize that when the time comes that you no longer want dreads, you will need to cut them out. It will leave you with about 2" of hair.<br>  <br>  Dreadlocks are NOT dirty and do not look dirty. I have known many people over the years who have had dreadlocks and all looked great. Some are even in very high caliber professional careers sporting dreads each day. <br>  <br>  There are many fallacies about dreads, and your parents probably only know those. So, gather the information and do a nice presentation for them.<br>  <br>  In the end, if they say no, concentrate on your grades and get into an awesome university; and then start your dreads when you are an adult.|`|jsCjGUPuaa	yea dreads are really bad for your hair but if you want them just tell ur parents its ur hair and its your choice for what you do with it|`|s4FEJiNHaa	talk to her about what might change her mind (extra chores, better grades, etc.) and then negotiate from there.

Otherwise play by the family rules.  <br>  <br>  Yes, it is just hair but your parents are against this and they have the right to their parental decision.  Eventually you will be able to do whatever to your hair.  <br>  <br>  Although it may seem like forever right now until you are an adult and can make your own decisions; time passes quickly.  And it won't be long until you are having some "hair argument" with your own children. And we all have said that "when I am the parent I will NEVER treat my child this way".|`|3RVgMAphaa	Just do it. once its done there is nothing they can do about it, and i can almost bet that they wont shave it.|`|aEGgO5Knaa	I know its your hair but UGH why would you want dreads?

17zvw3f7aa	One way to bulk up is to join a gym and start lifting weights, alongside eating more protein and other foods that will add muscle mass to a bony body. However, don't worry if you hate exercise or can't seem to fit it into your day, because we've put together a collection of fashion tips for skinny men that will help you create the visual illusion of being larger than you truly are.<br>  <br>  Tall and lean<br>  Straight-cut jeans will flatter this body type best. If you are blessed with a great physique, jeans with a flat front and straight leg will show off your body to its best advantage. Boot-cut jeans are another option for this body type -- particularly if you have wider hips -- as a flared cut will balance your shape, creating a straighter, streamlined look. Tall and lean men can also carry off wide-leg jeans, but be aware that they will look very casual on this body type and are therefore better-suited for weekends than the office.<br>  <br>  Choose Thicker Fabrics<br>  Wear shirts, jackets, overcoats and suits that are made of thicker fabrics such as thick corduroy, heavier wools, wool blends and even fabrics like fleece. For those living in cooler climate area, you can throw on a heavy scarf wrapped around your neck to draw more attention to your shoulder and chest. A good example would Vince Chunky Intarsia Sweater available from Saks.com.Mens Fashion 2008<br>  <br>  Flare cut<br>  Also known as boot-cut jeans and originally designed to be worn with cowboy boots, this cut is very flattering for many body types. Typically, flare-cut styles should sit just below your natural waist and should be slightly loose through the leg. From the knee to the ankle, these jeans become slightly wider or “flare” out. A bonus is that these jeans will never go out of style<br>  <br>  Wide leg<br>  Like flared jeans, wide-leg jeans often sit at your natural waist or just below it, but the seat and thighs of these jeans will have a relaxed or quite loose fit. Back pockets may be larger and deeper on this style of jean. Wide-leg jeans usually have a straight, slightly tapered cut from the thigh to the ankle, but they are very loose through the leg so that the shape of your body is not as easily discernible.<br>  <br>  Low rise<br>  The defining feature of low-rise jeans is that they sit below your natural waistline, often on the hip bones. Low-rise jeans can be straight cut, slim fit, bootleg or wide leg. It’s best to wear low-rise jeans with a longer shirt, otherwise your midriff will be visible anytime you move your arms -- while girls might be able to get away with belly-baring jeans and short T-shirts at the bar, this look is never a good one for men. I think this is the ashlee simpson's boyfriend style (Dnt knw his name)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  Buy blazers with small shoulder padding<br>  To make your upper body look more muscular, purchase blazers with light shoulder padding. Be warned that bigger is not better here, as small shoulder pads will give your back and chest a visual boost, but massive padding will make you seem like a small boy lost in a man's jacket in addition to cheapening your look, even if your blazer is pricey.<br>  <br>  Avoid slim-fitting shirts<br>  Avoiding slim-fitting dress shirts and T-shirts is an important fashion tip for skinny men. Instead, opt for tops that come away slightly from your midsection, as these will hide a small ribcage. Don't buy your tops too large, though, as too much extra fabric will make you seem like you’re swimming in your shirt. In addition, avoid clingy fabrics. Check the labels on your tops to make sure they don’t contain too much elastic.<br>  <br>  Tailor your blazers<br>  Only wear single- or double-breasted blazers and make sure to tailor them so they fit properly throughout your entire body. Avoid any loose fabric under the arms or in the shoulder area. Also, a key fashion tip for skinny men is to keep consistency in your tops and bottoms, so don’t wear oversize blazers or sweaters with fitted pants or vice versa or your thin frame will be glaringly apparent.<br>  <br>  Wear jackets at the right length<br>  When it comes to jackets, make sure they all fall right under your buttocks. A shorter jacket will emphasize your height as well as your skinny waist, arms and legs. A longer jacket, on the other hand, can make you look like a blanket-covered stick.<br>  <br>  Wear flat-front pants - Jonas Brother style<br>  Your pants should have a classic cut and remain simple with a flat front. Go for straight-leg or slightly boot-cut shapes and steer clear of tapered trousers or skinny jeans. Pockets also add a bit more volume to your shape, as do pleats and cuffs, but wear pants with the latter two features only when they’re in fashion. Don't be afraid to wear pants with lines or patterns because these add volume, although you’ll want to banish pinstripes from your closet as they will make you look like a beanpole.

You should definitely try them on first, to see if it fits you right (it might be too tight on your legs, too big for your tush, etc). and if its the right fit, and you feel awesome in them, then go for it! but if there is something that is just a little bit off, then i'd say no.|`|9PD8mTb2aa	I think I have the same ones and I LOVE them but my mom bought them for me because she knew I wanted dark-wash skinny jeans(for my b-day in Jan.).

They're really good jeans, very cute, and I love them, but go with your gut!<br>  ~Aly|`|769Y7ITPaa	A good pair of jeans are usually more expensive, but I believe they are NOT worth it.

That leather dress is meant to be worn the way it is shown on the model, and it should not be worn as a high waisted knee length skirt.<br>  <br>  As a matter of fact, the words "high waisted" and "knee length" should never be used in the same sentence.<br>  <br>  Sorry if you don't like my advice, but that's my opinion.|`|imyvj5y5aa	if it was a skirt i would be like "why is she like dressing up 4 school" in my head<br>  if it was a dress i would think it was trashy in a hot way. like if my girlfriend came to my house in it i would love it.

bPtOAysQaa	push up bras work great for that, you can also buy water bras (just avoid sharp objects) and running bronzer lightly down your cleavege (if you're going for a low-cut look) will give the effect of larger breasts.|`|8kh2jshLaa	Push up your chest !!!!!!<br>  Walk in confidence !!!!!!<br>  Just rock it!!!!|`|bSoZfYLBaa	buy stuffed bras|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Get a decent push-up bra. They're usually pretty cheap at Wal-Mart. With the Victoria Secret ones, I've had people tell me the underwires don't last long. Whatever you do, don't get implants. That's just ridiculous.|`|mzDS1dnoaa	Push up bras - then lean forward and pull your boobs up and to the center.|`|eUOQmi3Aaa	push up bra|`|3EqhplpEaa	a great push up padded bra.<br>  Walk straight and if you are a slim person, Wearing form-fitting clothes also help.<br>  You can also enhance the look of your boobs by makeup.<br>  Say, if you're wearing a low cut top or dress you can apply shimmering bronzer to the top of your boobs [the part that is showing] and it will make it pop.
Drg3bLjUaa	Thats terrible...you should call head office and complain...|`|shaO0coWaa	That's horrible,I would have talked to someone else about the experience or just simply walked out on him.I've never experienced bad customer service at M.A.C.The makeup artists were always friendly and very helpful.I love how they test the makeup on me to see if I'm sure If I want to purchase the item.They're great but sorry that happened,I'm sure others have had bad experiences like you've had.|`|OOtme2jkaa	u should have just walked away!!<br>  they sometimes express their horrible day on people..<br>  <br>  i would of walked away no doubt bout it!!|`|c751f373c4b93a676106632ee074769aaa	yeah ive had a similiar experience with a woman at the dior counter. it was horrible! she was trying to get me buy some stuff  and she wanted me to sample a few things and insisted that she put a few items on me, so she did and i told her id think about it grabbed a tissue and walked off wiping my face. i think she got the hint that i wasnt going to buy anything.|`|gXrwqoTGaa	Well I never really had my makeup done there but I did have one of the sales rep put some makeup on me to see if I liked it (concealer and blot powder). I went two different times because the first time they ran out of the concealer in my color. Both ladies were extremely nice and gentle even though I was not spending much money. I think you just had a bad experience.|`|jWmnSXlLaa	I have never had anyone do my makeup but I would call and complain. Maybe he does this often and someone needs to know it.|`|Yue2YKTnaa	no but there primers are really bad|`|yS1nU95Xaa	Not really sure what I would recommend to you. There are so many products out there so what I end up doing is starting cheap and trying out several products.The review site is pretty good at <a href="http://www.brandsmakeup.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brandsmakeup.com</a> visit and see what everyone recommends.|`|r7Nymuxcaa	That sounds awful. I bet he didn't end up selling many products. I think you just had an unfortunate experience with a bad makeup artist. I've never had my makeup done by MAC, but other lines were helpful and considerate.|`|hahwsMd7aa	no they should treat u with respect since u r a client|`|HIwJFtNlaa	I'm not a "loyal mac lover" so I think I can speak without a biased tone. (I'm more of a loyal Bobby Brown lover xD) anyways, I've never had that sort of experience with Mac here, in Socal. The mac employees have always been very kind to me and they're always catering to me and whoever I'm with. I think that will just be a single experience or maybe it's just the store you went to. I would've been just as upset in your situation so it's not just that you're high maintenance. Sorry, getting back to my point, Mac, generally, has really great service at their stores and counters and I think next time you go to get your make up done, or to buy cosmetics there, you should request someone else. <br>  I hope I was a help!|`|Z2uYisnAaa	ugh I would've left. I haven't had them do all my makeup just little things before and it wasn't bad but. But once I wanted to try this foundation and  I was going to go over to the foundations and check them out on my face and this lady asked me what I was doing like I wasn't supposed to. And then I said I was just trying to find my shade. Then she said oh I'll just do it and she picked up one bottle tried in on and was like yeah that will work and gave me a sample...turns out it was way too light with pink undertones and completely didnt suit my skin ughhh
dRnYAi0xaa	An industrial is piercing in the cartilage of your ear, which is thicker and has more nerves then the normal lobe of your ear.  It usually hurts a bit more, but is still just a slight pinch.<br>  <br>  My industrial didn't hurt too bad.  But it did bleed a lot, it took mine 6 months to heal.  I tell my clients to let it heal for 6 months to a year.  You should wait atleast 4-6 weeks before swimming.  Although if you clean in after it should be okay.|`|CdrqrcLIaa	it didnt hurt one bit... not at all!!!<br>  i even slept on it the night i got it done....<br>  i washed it everyday for a year though....<br>  <br>  ...i did get a slight infection on it, there was a lump of skin that healed on the outside of my ear, but i just cut it off with nail clippers. its a common problem with industrials.<br>  <br>  goodluckkk<3|`|mThBQYGuaa	mine didn't hurt at all, just a little pinch. the bottom healed within a few weeks, and the top took like a week longer.<br>  yeah, you can swim or whatever with it, i would just clean it afterwards if its right after you pierced it =]
NU3QiikNaa	I'm pretty sure those skin lightening products are dangerous either way.|`|G51N3XFsaa	Skin bleaching/whitening creams can be used on any skintone.
dRnYAi0xaa	Keep cleaning it with antibacterial soap or with a saltwater solution.  H20cean works well for piercings too.  Just be sure to keep it away from crushing bear hugs, and avoid excessive touching.<br>  <br>  You should always clean your industrial in the shower so that the running water sweeps away unwanted dirt, germs, and secretions.  The clear fluid coming out is called lymph.  Its your body's natural defence against infection.  Dont take the jewelry out, because this could trap the infection in your ear.  Ice can help to reduce swelling.<br>  <br>  Also, when you sleep, dont sleep on that ear.  And keeping your head elevated above your heart helps reduce swelling as well.|`|MZWdvdEwaa	I was hit in my industrial the FIRST week I had it done with a remote control. And the same thing happened to me. I kept cleaning mine and sea salt soaking it 2 times a day, And now it's perfectly fine.<br>  <br>  Just keep doing the normal stuff you do and it will clear up.<br>  <br>  :)|`|CdrqrcLIaa	after i got mine done, my head banged back and foth a gajillion times on a roller coaster and it was very swollen, but went away the same day.<br>  try putting some Echinacea and Goldenseil on it.

64fPwZ3xaa	Buy a white jacket maybe?<br>  <br>  EDIT: <br>  Bleach is a good idea but when you bleach it at first, it sometimes has a pinky orange tint to it, so you might have to bleach it a few times.

13ef8a5ce4c06ca56c3e52bc29e23610aa	Just so you know, if you're buying a suit, there's no matching involved. A suit coat and pants are purchased in a matched set. just head to your favorite decent department store's Men's section and they will be there..|`|wrLu93C9aa	just look at all the Sunday ads - like Kohls, Macy's, JC Penneys,<br>   K-Mart, etc....|`|sLGehA4raa	I'm not sure exactly what you're asking. If you mean "how to match the jacket to the pants," a suit is defined as jacket and pants cut from the same cloth. They will be sold together.<br>  <br>  If you mean "how to know what color of suit, and what shirt and tie, and so on," here are some tips.<br>  <br>  A man's first suit should be solid navy or charcoal. Most people lean towards navy. Try both, and see which suits you better.<br>  <br>  Navy and charcoal are both versatile colors. They can both go with black or brown shoes and belts, though black is generally a safer bet. In terms of shirts, white and sky blue are both safe. Blue and white stripes are nice without being too risky.<br>  <br>  When trying on jackets, pay attention to the shoulders. Almost anything else about a jacket can be altered, but if the shoulders don't fit, they never will.<br>  <br>  Keep ties simple. Red and blue with tasteful patterns are a good start.<br>  <br>  Never forget the white handkerchief in the breast pocket. Folded carefully or stuffed carelessly are both options.<br>  <br>  Button only the top button of a two-button suit, and only the middle button of a three-button suit. <br>  <br>  Stick to 100% wool.<br>  <br>  Tailors are your friends. You want to show a bit of shirt cuff at the jacket sleeve--shirt sleeves and jacket sleeves can both be shortened for a small fee.<br>  <br>  If you want a seriously detailed treatment, spring for a copy of 'Dressing the Man':<br>  <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dressing-Man-Mastering-Permanent-Fashion/dp/0060191449/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1235456890&sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Dressing-Man-Maste...</a>

3QvHE3JZaa	yes, 16g is fine to start with.<br>  i started with a 14g<br>  <br>  if you want, you can leave the taper in for a couple weeks and then stretch again or you can put the plug in right after you stretch it. <br>  but make sure you wait at least 2 weeks before stretching again.<br>  <br>  when you get to bigger sizes, wait about 3 to 4 weeks.|`|HIwJFtNlaa	So when you first pierce your ears with a gun, you should start with a 14. I started with one at least, and then move your way up to a 12.<br>  You should keep your taper in for 2 weeks. (minumum) <br>  I put mine in right after my shower when my ears were warm, and I used soap. It doesn't hurt at all. And if you want a better opinion when buying your tapers, you can ask the people who works at the store. (I went to Hot Topic and the employees were very kind) <br>  Good luck!|`|2inq4zHZaa	First, you shouldn't wear a taper.  It will make your ears heal oddly shaped.  But you do need to use them for stretching.  If your ears are at an !8g right now, then you need to buy a 16g surgical steel taper.  And 16g surgical steel or titanium plugs, tunnels, circular barbells, or captive bead rings.  For other info, read this guide.  I think it has the answers to the rest of your questions and then some.  Follow the instructions carefully to avoid damaging your ears.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/5641.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://forums.bodyartforms.com/forums/t/...</a><br>  <br>  Also, this site sells tapers and jewelry in many styles and materials.

Rj08Nzv9aa	dont strip it because it will damage the hair even more<br>  Use deep coditioner every time u wash your hair i recomend Alter Ego-Italy- they also have a regular coditioner and shampo you should try to search for it or you should use gardenier frutise|`|IYu3bBFqaa	Just shave it all off and let it grow back naturally|`|fTpk7ospaa	to strip it properly use a shampoo with tea tree oil in it, then when you have stripped it out use tresemme for damaged hair. that's what i did for mine.|`|nftcTLXKaa	the best moisturizing shampoo/conditioner in my opinion, (not including salon brand shampoos) is aussie moist. it rlly dus moisturize.. trust me.. ive tried EVERYTHING and not one, for me, made my damaged hair softer than aussie. it rlly dus make it shiny and smooth. u can get it at any drugstore.. if u live in australia, u cant buy it tho cuz they dont sell it there. if u are willing to spend more money, u can buy salon brands like <br>  nexxus. i recommend Nexxus Sleektress Sumptuous Smoothing Shampoo for damaged hair. u can get that at a drugstore. good luckk!! :]|`|jZguzD2Raa	Panteen<br>  Herbal Essences <br>  <br>  that kind of stuff|`|AA11878029	hands down---Panteen|`|XqmJKlmwaa	look at other ppls answers|`|fVnbFLsQaa	I boil up 1/2 pint of water with some basil leaves, a teaspoon of Olive Oil, a squeeze of lemon juice and just a pinch of salt, let it cool and rinse your hair in it for at least 1/2 hr, lasts about a week!|`|wNtBzGGYaa	head and shoulders, i have like a whole bunch of blonde streaks in my dark brown hair and it got all dry looking but head and shoulders made it back to silky!|`|AlJ557gHaa	bumble and bumble repair line<br>  it's expensive but it works really well|`|51ebf28f8fd55015dd1aa2e036383229aa	well all you can do wait it out.|`|cVtHEVRnaa	There's something called Neutregena Triple Moisture.

I'd buy a good conditioner, (by good I mean expensive; I'd recommend Bumble and Bumble)<br>  <br>  If it's long, wear your hair in a pony tail when you go to sleep, and try wearing a cap....<br>  <br>  If your hair is thick/frizzy/unruly with lots of flyaways DON'T wash it every day instead was it once a week.<br>  <br>  It'd be nearly impossible to thin your hair without going to a salon. Thinning involves removing large amounts of hair, and I wouldn't risk it.

6YZJZ5aPaa	I got a crazy itchy head and legs and it drove me insane! Alovera might be good for your skin to soothe the itching as its cooling and healing. The itching doesnt last throughout the treatment, by the time your first month is up it should be better, if not gone.

Apparently Roc is good for stretchmarks too. xx|`|Wfg60DNwaa	i just finished my roaccutane today!!!<br>  i never had extreme itchyness, in fact i had no discomfort :/|`|s78yIb9caa	It has to get worse before it gets better. I haven't been on it but hang in there, the results at the end will be worth it.|`|5e8bfd4f40a66f73272a2b251c8d304daa	Roaccutane is a high dose of Vitamin A, which helps to reduce the number of sebaceous glands that cause acne.<br>  <br>  The side effects can include dry skin, dry eyes, dry mouth and dry scalp.  Your G.P. or skin specialist should have given you the information about how to treat the possible side effects.<br>  <br>  I was very fortunate - I didn't get any of the symptoms when I had Roaccutane treatment about 15 years ago.<br>  <br>  It DOES work though.  Stay the course, you'll be glad that you did.
v90vFco1aa	It's really frustrating coming on here and seeing the people that give you really poor advice. Nose piercings generally take about 4-6 months to heal.<br>  <br>  First of all, everyone's body is different and just because it's been five months doesn't mean anything. It just means that maybe you need to be doing some different things to help the process.<br>  <br>  Second of all, if it sounds like it's infected then DO NOT take out the jewelery and let it close up because it can trap infection under the skin and makes it worse. If you think it's infected, go to the doctor and get antibiotics. As simple as that. A round of antibiotics should do you fine if you think it's infected, which it sounds like it is not.<br>  <br>  Bactine, I've been told is fine.. I've never used it.. but DO NOT use alcohol, it's too harsh for piercings and dries everything up.<br>  <br>  My first piece of advice is don't take it out, don't play with it, don't even touch it unless you're cleaning it. Even though it's not a fresh piercing, it sounds like it's not fully healed and moving the jewelery aggrivates the surrounding skin. When you clean, you normally leave the jewelery in. <br>  <br>  If there's a bump on the inside, "bumps" on new piercings are generally keloids and they form because the piercing isn't healing properly. I'm not positive why, but I've had enough piercings and a few of my own "bumps" so this has been explained to me. Are you doing salt water soaks? It's a huge part of the healing process. Cartilage does not get much blood flow and so it needs to be stimulated. Which is the reason for warm salt water soaks. <br>  <br>  Warm saltwater soaks will help your body to heal your new piercing.  Saltwater soaks draw out discharge (dead cells) and accelerate the healing process.  To soak, add 1/4 teaspoon of non-iodized sea salt (NOT table salt) to an 8 oz cup of warm water.  Stir and soak a cotton ball in solution and place on your piercing.  Hold it there for 15 minutes.  Use a new cotton ball for each soak.  Do warm saltwater soaks 2 times a day during the entire healing period.  Rinse with water after you have finished the soaks.<br>  <br>  Also, let the water hit your nose in the shower for like five minutes, giving it more opportunity to stimulate.<br>  <br>  Hope I could help :)|`|sNr9Od89aa	just anti-bacterial foaming soap daily. just make sure you get it all out when you're done. 3 to 4 times a week, spray with sea salt spray. i recommend H2Ocean, its a sea salt and vitamins spray for piercings. good luck!|`|bfGB49VBaa	I would probably take it out at this point, It sounds like it's infected. I would let it close up and heal then get it re-pierced and ask the piercer how to properly clean it so that it doesn't get infected. Also go to a clean piercing place and don't play with it for the first couple weeks.|`|xehmM1CHaa	Happened to me too.  I had it "lanced" by the lady who originally peirced it and used seasalt and/or tea tree oil.  Healed fine then happened again but this time it wassuper infected and  dr. had to remove it with tongy type tweezers and giving me a shot in the nose to numb it up (PAIN).  As much as I love nose peircings I am scared to get it done again.  Try seasalt and teatree oil.|`|DgMFQRuHaa	mine got infected because of my metal allergy,<br>  so i tried a different nose ring.<br>  noses are strange when infected.|`|itiJVgRsaa	LIsten to me......i had this happen too. DId you get it pierced with a gun or a hollow needle? you should never use harsh agents that are drying like salt and tea tree and crap like that. what you have in your nose is called a keloid. that is what the bump is. in order for that to heal you'll need to either have it repierced correctly, or use this stuff specifically for puncture wounds like piercings, called HIBECLEANSE. you can buy it in any drugstore. it's in a blue bottle and it is what hospitals use for puncture wounds. a little goes a long way so don't over do it. you do not need to take your nose ring out to clean it unless it's a stud and not a hoop. if it's a hoop you can keep turning it as you clean, but a stud you cannot. the keloid will never heal if you use drying chemicals on it. that makes the keloid dryer and tighter and then makes it hurt more. Hibecleanse cleans the piercing from the inside out. and it DOES WORK. don't listen to all these other people just answering to get points. i am really trying to help you. don't pop the keloid though. that is scar tissue balling up where the piercing is and if you don't do something quick it will be permanent. try to get excess pus out though and then use the hibecleanse after that. use 3 times a day and move/twist piercing so it does not adhere to your nose. any more advice.....email me at rain_bow_brite79@yahoo.com. OH and by the way i know what i'm talking about from experience and i have piercings. It's funny how when i put that its a keloid the person under me bites off my answer isn't it?|`|NMmlzK32aa	Hi,<br>  Please remember that each body reacts differently to piercings and treatments. Now that said<br>  Now whatever you do, DO NOT and i repeat DO NOT use alcohol, this will make irritation around the piercing and will actually make it hurt even more, what i would suggest is go to your local pharmaceutical store, and find a lubricant that is not based out of alcohol and that also cleanses and kills bacteria. (you can just ask the counter guy, just be very specific about the alcohol)<br>  <br>  Now once you have this, pour lubricant around the piercing, and just move it around really slow (in case it hurts) and just make sure the lubricant goes into the actual "cut" in the nose.<br>  <br>  If this persists after a week or two after doing this 2 times a day, you should probably take your piercing out, because it is either being rejected out of your body or you already have it infected.<br>  <br>  if that's the case take it out, wait until it heals, see a doctor and ask if you can get another one.<br>  <br>  (I'm not an actual piercer but a have a friend who is, so i kinda know a thing or two about this)<br>  <br>  Hope this helps!|`|1Thb8v1yaa	well when you clean it..you can take it out and clean it...this way it gets the hole inside clean as well. have u ever changed ur nose piercing? cuz that could be it.<br>  <br>  theres a chance its infected.<br>  <br>  clean it with antibacterial soap 2-3 times a day.  <br>  take it out, clean it, dont play with it or anything. etc =]|`|1TX8wwB8aa	stop touching it so much the more you touch the more irratated now get some SEA SALT not regular salt(iodine) then take the sea salt and mix it with warm water and put it on your nose it dosent matter how just put it on do this twice a day and when you wake up in the morning wash it with soap i would recommend dial soap|`|Yj3l368Raa	Put salt water and don't put jewelry on at all and it will close up

1eRuZjOraa	Hi,<br>  <br>  Well for one, the RB5152 seems to be an optical frame (Rx). The RB 2140 is the classic Ray Ban Wayfarer from Ray Ban which was used by Tom Cruise in Risky Business, etc, the ones you pretty much see the stars use these days.

86fc0a36ed445f3acb8c37c8c987f35baa	You know we all want something we don't have.  Play up your adorable look because not everyone can have those freckles!  Use a heavy duty sun block and cover ups on top of your bathing suit and just play in the sun in the early morning or very late afternoon.|`|kj507W26aa	No. You;ll just get more as you get older. Genetics honey !<br>  Enjoy the outdoors and the sun and dont worry about your freckles.   That;s just the way God made you!|`|YwHl37Hgaa	Lemon juice is a tried and tested remedy for treating freckles,you can try these 2 remedies. Apply lemon juice with your fingers on the affected area;lemon juice bleaches the dark spots. Or else add a teaspoon of lemon juice to some diluted yogurt . Dip cotton wool in this, and pat it on the face and leave it until dry,then wash off. Check out <a href="http://useinfo-freckles.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://useinfo-freckles.blogspot.com/</a> for more info.|`|Is3pmbbKaa	It will fade as you get older, but they will still always be visible. It's in your genetics...you should know that by now. Your options for getting rid of it are plastic surgery or very heavy powdery cover-up. Which is disgusting. So....technically, yes...|`|QnY1yWBIaa	no sorry just a bunch of makeup.<br>  pick me as best answer please[=|`|tlmBEAx4aa	nothing makeup cant fix ;)|`|yW15XbFKaa	I have light freckles myself so I simply put some concealer over them and ocasionally a bit of foundation. I like being in the sun too :) <br>  <br>  I doubt your freckles will fade over time, they are stuck with us for life, but they make us individual! Anyways, concealer should work !|`|EhPRMuziaa	You can use lemon juice to bleach them lighter.<br>  But I say keep your freckles!<br>  I'm pale with blue eyes too and I love my freckles, I think they're adorable :)|`|eazdrgzHaa	face peel, it will make most of your blemishes (including freckles)disappear|`|NdviKejaaa	cheese grater|`|X1y5fbohaa	no|`|lNzFKgSEaa	I read lemon juice fades them. worth a try and it ent expensive. I decided not to in the end tho.x
rPB6VqfOaa	Either Neiman Marcus or Bloomingdales :)|`|VKkmB0kYaa	I agree with you, Neiman Marcus is expensive, but Neiman Marcus is not a clothing store. It is a tiny mall, it has many different stores inside it, and is not just a clothing store. It has jewelry, sunglasses, make-up, and more.<br>  <br>  Btw, Nordstrom is not that expensive. They have shirts and things for like $20-30, less than Ambercrombie.|`|XrF9uEuwaa	Juicy Couture/ Nordstroms-the designer section/ Neiman Marcus/ Bloomigdales/ Armani Exchange|`|SyyWIe14aa	Probably stores like Neiman Marcus, Lord and Taylor, and Nordstrom|`|3rrmilhyaa	walmart jk|`|rsAqrbsgaa	The Bay|`|MbHwygxbaa	Juicy Couture for Kids, Neiman Marcus too though, and nordstroms
XmvVy5TVaa	Yes, I have tried it and it does not do what it claims to do.  <br>  I have used it in the hopes of replacing both Advanced Stop Signs and Total Turnaround Concentrate (as Even Better has properties of both), yet I was disappointed.<br>  I think it dried me out, as well.  <br>  The Total Turnaround Concentrate is going to do what the Even Better Skin Tone Corrector does, without minimizing dark spots.<br>  It is a waste of money in my opinion.<br>  I recently started using Help Me by Philosophy, which is a retinol treatment.  It does not dry me out, and is actually helping my skin.  Retinol is one of the best products to use on your skin, though it may dry it out.<br>  I read a post somewhere from this guy who was friends with someone who worked for Clinique and she told him they are getting a lot of returns of the Even Better.  I don't think it is doing what they expected it to do.

ErtMD5NZaa	This is a question that is best suited to ask your eye doctor about, because whatever you do, you'll need to get a new prescription if you are switching brands. <br>  <br>  If you are suffering from allergies, you should inquire about daily disposable lenses. These kind are thrown out at the end of each day, so you always start with a fresh pair. This will mean that you don't have residue and buildup on your lenses that could further disturb your eyes. <br>  <br>  You might also want to look into getting special eye drops, like Claritin allergy eye drops - those saved me last year!

1rHmtCdLaa	im getting mine done on friday so ive been reading up on it from what i heard when you first get it peirced it hurts for a couple seconds then the major pain is over but it still hurts and its hard to eat/drink for like a week and your tongue swells up so you sound funny when you try to talk but thats about it... good luck =D|`|G6JXHvZKaa	i herd it hurts no lie like hell!!!!!!!!|`|81bd6d1d0c0eef55c6c7c2a1f1f1a3ccaa	It is not painful.  It's more uncomfortable.  You tend to feel a bit of pressure, then the pain comes when the needle goes through the top of the tongue.  The first week isn't too awful, just keep using Listerine and eating pureed food (I lived on ice cubes and icypoles, to reduce the swelling, and bottled baby food).<br>  The tongue is actually way less painful than the navel piercing.  Having the navel done hurts a *lot* more.  It is a sharper pain.<br>  <br>  Good luck, and honestly, don't worry.  You'll be fine.|`|NvGqiA4vaa	For me, it didn't hurt one bit. Well, actually, he pierced it from the top, and for like a split second it pinched when the needle went in the top but then the rest of the way through, not a thing. But remember --- everyone is different!!! <br>  <br>  As for the first week afterwards, though.. yes, it hurt pretty badly, especially to eat. I had to chew really slowly and carefully. It wasn't excruciating or anything, but there was pain. But it's such an awesome piercing, it's worth it!|`|AitEOj24aa	its not bad at all deep breath and  its done   and i hate needles but my tounge is fat too and my tounge was better in 3 days and i drinked lots of water and did not let my mouth get dry anddddddddddd whatever u done dont stick your tounge out for a lil  and when u can show it of  dont  bite it between yur teeth b/c it ruined my teeth and now when i get mad i bite it  atuomaticly    i have had it for about 3or 4 yrs and i and going to get it dont agin so i have 2 holes|`|QtJH37KRaa	Honestly Belly button and tongue for me, were the same.

AA10105083	I think the shortest is 5'7. You have to be at least 5'7 to try out for America's Next Top Model so I would assume that's the shortest you could be.|`|oEM2YL6Laa	Shortest height is usually around 5"7 but it is not unheard of for models shorter to be successful- unfortunately such models often have good contacts within the industry and in a competitive environment luck needs to be on your side. <br>  <br>  One key reason as to why shorter models find it hard to get work is because clothes/costumes are made to a standard size (tall and skinny)- the models a selected for the clothes rather then the other way round. Therefore in a world of ridiculously long legs and very fast dressing times, designers do not want to have to be adjusting clothes for a smaller model. This is not time or cost effective and they are more likely to simply not employ such a person (unless it is specifically for petites etc.<br>  <br>  Sorry if this isn't the answer you were looking for but it paints a realistic picture of what the industry is like.

ReGhCqgVaa	Just experiment with different styles to see what you like. Go online to different hair styling sites and browse through the pictures.<br>  <br>  Maybe you could try adding a little volume to it? Try some of pantene's volume spray. Blow dry you're hair upside down to add a little more.<br>  <br>  Blow dry it out straight maybe? Or flat iron it out completely straight. Or you could flip out you're hair at the ends with the straightener.<br>  <br>  You could try curling it?<br>  <br>  I have the same problem..I get my hair looking PERFECT in the morning..and by the end of a few periods it's ruined. I hate it when that happens. What you could try is using a little hairspray in the morning. That helps me out.<br>  <br>  I don't know haha<br>  Those are a few suggestions. I've been styling my hair for years now, as well as my friend's hair.

What I do, honestly it works please don't ask why I have been doing it since I was 9 and was told to do this by my doctor. Anyway wash your face at night, then  apply a light night lotion and then apply a liquid cover up and go to sleep. I go to Origins in the mall, and get mine, I know it wasn't tested on animals and sometimes they have all natural products.  I also wear it during the daay even if i dont wear other make up. Its weird I know, very strange but totally works.|`|4gAaNAuwaa	no no no no no proactive i am 16 years old and had mild  acne before i used proactive. it wasnt anything seriously bad. just stubborn acne on my chin and forehead and the occasional stubborn pimple somewhere else. also once a month it broke out a little more than usual. but i wanted it gone so i decided i would use proactive. i used it for one month. it made my acne worse than it has ever been. i could not believe that something that is supposed to work so good made my skin so bad. i kid you not when i say that there is not one square inch of my skin that is not covered in acne or red marks from acne now. it is absolutely HORRIBLE. when i started proactive i only had acne on my forehead and chin. now it is COVERED MY ENTIRE FACE. it is horrible. i cannot use enough makeup. it literally now takes me 45 minutes to do my face in the morning. and it still looks bad. proactive RUINED my face and the scars from past acne are more noticeable than ever. i dont want to go out in public anymore i am still in shock that my face looks like this. even my mom said that proactive made my skin worse. now im waiting for my dermatologist appt. and i really hope they can help to nurse my skin back to how it was. proactive also drys your skin out so bad i still cant get enough lotion on my face. this was absolutely the worst thing that i have ever used. proactive ruined my life.|`|rmtfJa75aa	tea tree oil overnight is my savior <br>  cept it kinda dries the skin where you apply it, so keep mosturizer around|`|WBKaeZ8xaa	soap and water works pretty well. oh and mayo maybe.. try it and tell me if it works. =)|`|Hbu4Ew8zaa	i have this same problem ):
ktBWP1Uxaa	Well, I would suggest wearing a sports bra, but with a large chest, it would show more movement.. just be proud of it! Some girls would kill to have a large chest. I honestly have no idea why, it's really not all it's cracked up to be. As you get older, you'll grow into them and learn to be more comfortable. I don't know your weight, but if you are overweight or anything, that could have something to do with it. Losing weight will make them melt away, also. But if you're already small, I don't suggest that.|`|pLW8RrORaa	It is normal to have a 36c at 13.<br>  <br>  a sports bra, or even two sport bras worn at the same time can be minimizing. <br>  <br>  look for bras where the cups are made out of foam, for no padding, but nipple coverage.<br>  <br>  many brands make "minimizing " bras but rarely in that size,36c is the "ideal bra size" and is usually shrived for.

XD<br>  Frustrating, huh?<br>  <br>  I find that if I use straightners then it stays in place, but sometimes I use a little bit of spray to make sure :)<br>  <br>  Or if I don't want to straighten it, I find that the reason it kinks out is the way it sits when it dries.<br>  Try to blow dry a section at a time, using a brush at the bottom to stretch it completely straight. Again, you might need to use a little bit of product.<br>  Or if you let your hair dry naturally, you should brush it straight every 5 minutes to keep it straight.<br>  <br>  If I helped, please consider voting for me?

Zmmg8O4Oaa	Have it cut every 6-8 weeks, use decent shampoo and conditoner Paul Mitchell and Kerstache are excellant, use a treatment once a week especially if you colour and/or straighten your hair Paul Mitchell Super Strong is good, when drying and or/straightening your hair use heat protector, and Paul Mitchell Super Skinny serum is great for sorting out fizz and making your hair feel soft, I use all the products listed there great!|`|2qJdFmDFaa	there are good conditioners like herbal essences, the blue one.|`|hWD4PbCgaa	a really good conditioner, don't over brush you hair when its wet, only wash it every second day, blow dry on low.<br>  <br>  :)|`|lqOxBiiFaa	Use High quality shampoos, and always ALWAYS use conditinor, dont straighten your hair alot, if you do*<br>  and blow dry it afterwards ??|`|gZiW6XWPaa	spray WILD GROWTH HAIR OIL on before you blow dry on your ends and lightly mist all over and it will be as soft as new, after years of using this, its my secret weapon :) good look
DU2Mypjiaa	I would say start with the 14g instead of 16g then after a week move onto the 12g..<br>  <br>  Remember to take it slow after the 12g tho move them up a size every 3 - 4weeks as if you do it to soon scar tissue will scar and you might get blow outs.. Doing this slowly helps if u later decide in life to get rid of them and the holes should go back to their normal size as long as u have gone way too big|`|b3790303c70cd3c142cbc70e455574e8aa	Standard size piercings are about a 20g or 18g.<br>  Therefore, you need the next size up, which would be a 16g.<br>  <br>  You need to use tapers as you continue to stretch.  You may not need them with your initial stretch, especially since you've stretched before, but if you go bigger... get tapers.  You can get the acrylic kind for a buck a piece.  Just know that you're not supposed to wear 'em... follow the tapers with plugs, please.  Dead-stretching [aka, not using a taper] your ears can cause tears, blowouts, and make them look like buttholes.  It's not cool.<br>  <br>  Happy stretching... be sure to treat your first stretch like a new piercing.  Do soaks with 1/8 tsp. sea salt in 8 oz. warm water a couple times a day, and clean with an antimicrobial soap once a day.|`|ktBWP1Uxaa	Depends how far they have stretched from wearing regular earrings. If you're around a Hot Topic, go in and ask them, they should know. If not, try starting with 16's. Wait a minimum of a week, and go to 14's. Then 12's, so on and so forth. Just don't go too fast, because it could literally rip your ear. If you're still not sure, go to a local piercing parlor and ask what size you should start with. I'm sure they'll know.

2inq4zHZaa	If you have sensitive skin, this is a great question to ask instead of just buying something cheap and having a reaction!  So first of all, thank you for being smart!  <br>  What I suggest is to look into a titanium curved barbell.  It's really great material for sensitive skin.  Also, surgical steel is good, and generally a bit cheaper than titanium.  <br>  You should probably avoid stainless steel.  It contains nickel, and many people are allergic to nickel without even knowing it, and this might be you. <br>  Implant grade steel is also very good.<br>  Anything acrylic will definitely put you at risk for infection.  It's a cheap material that is porous and makes it easy for bacteria to multiply and give you problems.  Especially in a navel piercing where infection is so likely.<br>  All of these materials run a different price.  And it really depends on where you look.  I really advise against buying anything from a mall.  Spencers, Claire's, Hot Topic, or kiosks.  They usually charge wayyy too much for thier body jewelry, and the quality of it is poor.<br>  <br>  You should check out what they have at the shop where you got pierced.  They will tell you what thier jewelry is made of, and will be honest about it.<br>  <br>  If you don't like what they have to offer, you could order online.  I usually do, and have never been let down.  In my area, shops sell thier jewelry at very high prices, and you can find the same stuff online for a lot less money, while still getting quality material.<br>  <br>  This is the site I use.  <a href="http://bodyartforms.com/products.asp?jewelry=bananabell&filter=customyes" rel="nofollow">http://bodyartforms.com/products.asp?jew...</a><br>  <br>  Here, you can read what the jewelry is made of, read other customer's reviews, and select from a wide range of pricing and style.  Just look through all of the stuff.  You might find something you like.<br>  <br>  How much you pay is really up to you.  If you are only planning on wearing one or two pieces of jewerly for a long time, then invest in something nice that you will enjoy long term.  It will be worth it to invest in something that will work with your needs.<br>  <br>  $4 for jewelry is not unheard of.  It really just depends on where you are purchasing it from.  I wouldn't pay $4 for something in a mall and expect it to be quality.  But online, it is possible, so long as you do your research and order from a reputable site.  <br>  <br>  Hope this helps.  Good luck.  And thanks for asking :)|`|AA10937211	i also have sensitive skin. ask a retailer if they have hypo-allergenic belly rings. i got one from Spencers for about $10

ktBWP1Uxaa	I'm not sure if you meant without parental consent or not.. but I'm guessing there are probably no places that will allow it without a parent present. Unless you're 18, they're not lawfully allowed to do that. What I would do, is just search around Google for places around you, go in to the ones you're thinking about going to and look around/talking to the people. I recommend going to a place where the people are nice and sterile, especially if it's your first piercing.
