o7EwHS5jaa	Get hold of a guide. There are many out there both free and paid for.    Free I would say www.wow-pro.com, this is an excellent guide although as yet you have to alt-tab out of the game to use.    Paid for guide I would say Zygor Guides is by far the best one out there, you can read a great review at http://www.zygorguides101.com .     Quest helper is great, but your not following the path of those who create power leveling guides. The two above both follow such a path, but i have to say that out of those Zygors is by far the quickest and easiest to use.
bsy7Pn9vaa	This is why i quit habbo, back in the old days it use to be perfect but with a bunch of n00bs flooding the sever and these new updates it would get even more lagy. Theres nothing you can do about it habbo glitches. Glitches happen and habbo won't do sh*t but update it with more crap.

BfU2TSqbaa	Whoa, I really randomly stumbled upon this and realized that I recently played and added you on Rock Band--ranked score duels I think. This is NameBag lol.    I'll totally form a band with you if you want; I play Expert on all instruments, guitar/bass better than others, and I'm online a fair amount of the time. I could use a few of the random achievements tbh.    I don't think there's a way that I can record videos and post them at the current time. However, I might be able to eventually.|`|qZGkVsKWaa	I'll message you as soon as I get my new Gold membership. I just recently ran out of XBL Membership and i need to buy a card. I can play bass, guitar, and drums all on expert and hit 98% and up on notes. I've hit 100% notes on nearly all songs now and It's really easy for me. I love rock band and I will play with you as soon as I can get My XBL Card.  [ I just Need 4 more songs on expert 100% and I would have played the whole game on expert 100% notes hit. :D     My favorite song to play on expert with guitar and drums is Panic Attack by Dream Theater. I've hit 100% notes on that song so many times already I pretty much Mastered it. :)

YsBrTBmIaa	You buy the game then you have the chance to create a 10 day trial account, which has very limited features :(    After the 10 days you use your credit card to buy 15 days of gameplay for 15 dollars, or a gamecard at a retail store for 30 dollars that gives you 60 days, and after you have paid for at least one month or two months (credit card OR gamecard) then you get a free 30 days registered to your account AFTER the first is paid for.    I've only seen 30 not 60.   60 is for the 30 dollar Game cards.|`|a8tsrTCbaa	If it doesn't say it has it, then it won't have it.|`|SXAKdZX8aa	Dont get WOW get Diablo 2 it's a lot better.|`|zWEvptQSaa	comes with 30    but check into the battle chest, it comes with burning crusade and 30 days of regular and 30 for BC|`|Swmd0P2uaa	No you dont get 60 days free. You need to know something before you buy this: http://www.gamestop.com/Catalog/ProductD...  You are looking at buying the first edition of WOW. SInce then there was the Burning Crusade expansion, and recently the Wrathe of The Lich King expansion. You need all the parts. Before you buy online I suggest looking at buying it on WOW official website. You can download it (on more than one computer) and this way you will be sure to get all teh parts, because Im sure they have a good deal. Also, you can get 10 day free trial from their site. Another option is to buy the Chess-pack- or whatever they call it. Its like a getting started box with everything you need to date. Gamestop can help you out! Have fun!

iokenkiQaa	Yes, in game you get a +3 to your constitution if your all light. I forgot all dark, I think all dark was +3 strength.|`|kvNbiQ3Gaa	nope.... there is no rewards after you finished the game but the coolest things in this game is you can choose if you want to become dark jedi or light jedi. But you can use mod tool if you wanna look cooler, you can dressup like the dark lord Revan, change its appearance, unlooked all skill, maksimum stats, unlimited power etc. You can do all of that by downloading the mod tool. This way the game will more and more fun to play, have a nice try ^^

However, Gears 2 multiplayer (with the exception of the intense Horde Mode) wait times are pathetic. I would Play Gears 1 over Gears 2 if youre looking for Online Intensity. I loved the Fallout Storyline but its missing the key to a great game,...Online Multiplayer, So go with Gears 1 & 2, you cant go wrong!|`|HUfm3KrLaa	I LOVED fallout 3. And don't think that its weak just because I'm a girl. If you've ever played Oblivion, you'll love it.|`|a8tsrTCbaa	If you prefer shooter based RPGs than Fallout 3. Its single player though. Refer to Oblivion if you want to know more about what its like.    If you want fast paced shooter combat then Gears of War 2. Its multi-player.|`|yV5xKI0Xaa	neither, there both shiit but, borrow them from the vid shop...

Ps3 doesn't have many games. The ps3 is for a casual gamer, someone who doesnt play often. The xbox is for someone who likes playing fun games like halo and stuff. But if you want to play online, iwould still get xbox360. I dont knwo much about games cause all i use is the 360. But, if you don't know this, the xbox is made cheaper than when it first came out. Lots of things have been removed. Its not good quality as in durable or long lasting like it was. But i would still stick with the 360 because its more fun. All my friends have 360. Just want to give you a general idea.|`|N7ga89vIaa	I own the PS3, Xbox 360 and the Wii.  I would have to say that the Xbox is hands down the best.  There are very few PS3 exclusives and since you don't care about bluray, there really isn't an advantage to the PS3.  The online game playing is way better on the Xbox.  It is worth the extra 50 bucks a year.  The Xbox can properly interact with an ipod while the PS3 can't.  The Xbox works as a media extender and can access your Media Center PC.  This allows you to stream video, pictures, music, and even television.  It also interacts with standard windows PCs better than the PS3.    http://www.barstoolsandchairs.com|`|jg11X64gaa	people are waiting for killzone 2  go to http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/ps3/ for the top games  some really good games that already have been released includes metal gear solid 4 and Grand theft auto 4|`|awShhMvfaa	I have a Playstation 3, and I love it, but the online experience through XBox 360 is a lot better (except for the thousands of 10 year olds that goof off online).  Playstation is constantly improving and has some great games like Metal Gear Solid 4, Uncharted: Drakes Fortune, Gran Turismo 5 and Killzone 2 coming out at the end of this month, but if you're only into gaming then go with the XBox as they have a lot of great games and graphics wise, they are pretty much the same at this point.   Personally, I love using my Playstation 3 as a PC (with Linux installed) as a media hub for playing movies, music, and photos off of my desktop, watching blu-rays and DVDs, and I also watch TV online from Hulu now that the PS3 internet browser supports flash 9.  There are tons of things you can do with the PS3, but like I said, if you are only looking to game XBox has some really good exclusives that I missed out on. :(|`|Npi4QR7Maa	I've had both systems and here is my opinion on both of them    The 360 Pros:  -Fun online play  -Microsoft store is good to download shows and Original games  -Great exclusive games like Gears of War and...uh...gears of war 2    360 Cons:  -The failure rate. The past 2 years I've been through 9 console  -Most of the games on the system can be found on the PS3 as well  -Loudest system. You can barley hear you play the game over the system    PS3 pros:  -Blu-ray  -Full access to the Internet including video access  -Great exclusives like Resistance, MGS4, Killzone 2, and Littlebigplanet  -upcoming games like God of War 3, inFamous, and MAG(where you can play online with up to 250 people)  -Better graphics than the 360    Cons:  -System is very large and the finish on it makes every fingerprint and dust particle visible.      Those are the only cons I can think of.|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	Hi, to answer your question i would go with the PS3.  it is a much more reliable system and you will get a lot more "game-time" for your buck.  In saying this most people have not yet experienced the red light of doom on the 360's  But it has already appeared on 2 of my friends 360's. Not me yet luckily!  Also in my opinion sports games are much easier on the psx style controller.  As for game satisfaction overall load times, PS3 is great.|`|8xDSKf3Maa	Pros:     Hardware:   Three different types of 360's to purchase, the 360 Arcade, Pro, or Elite. Their fairly cheap for being a great console, each giving you different choices in price, backwards compatability, and playing in High-Definition. Removeable harddrive, 2 Memory Card slots, 2 USB ports, ethernet port, wireless port, dvd player. Many accessories ranging from wired chargers to new faceplates & HDMI DVD Player. Wired controllers (also work on PC) along with the battery munching wireless controllers. ( Just buy Energizer rechargeables, with the charger, you'll be set for 2 years). Ever since the fall update, the 360 has got itself keyboard support, which really helps out when your IMing, or just signing up for Live.    Cons:    Hardware:   Everybody knows the failure rate of the 360 at launch due to overheating, freezing etc... it was about I heard in the mid 30's, which a console should be below 5%. You'll never know when yours is ready to kick the bucket. But fortunately, the warrenties were extended for 3 years and repair services seemed to work. Microsoft makes you buy a lot of add on accessories just to keep you gaming, such as the wired charger, great device, but it shouldn't be necessary! The AA batteries should be able to last long enough, instead their gobbled up by your wireless controller. Some idiots try to fix the 360 with towells, which work for a week then your ******. Basically thats just the biggest problem for the 360 but now the hardware failure is A LOT lower than it was. Also, the Live headset that comes with the Pro is worthless, it will break after a month, best thing to do there is get the wireless one, works great, never fails.    Software:   Everybody hates to spend $65.00 on a game, when sometimes the game BLOWS. Fortunately theres a fix to this, and it's called www.gamefly.com , or you could just read reviews on the internet and see for yourself. Ever since "next-gen" graphics the price has been raised but thats what we get if we want beautiful games I guess...    Online Service:   Yes Xbox Live is an excellent service, but why the **** is it $50.00/year?! Well the answere to that is greedy Microsoft, and its just a good service, but it lacks a couple things. 1 It doesn't have an internet browser, 2 M$ gives you tainted updates (Fall, they shouldda really tested it better), 3 ESRB ***** you over if your under 18 for downloading M rated demos, M= 17+, but they want you to turn 18 to play M rated games, which makes no mutherfucking sense at all.    PS3:    Pros:    Hardware: One of its biggest +'s is the slick, black sexy design & chrome trim Sony gave it. A very nice 40/80GB harddrive, plus lets not forget about the(whats the touch power button called), it's one of the newer additions to any next-gen console and its virtually silent without overheating. Unlike the Xbox 360, their controllers DON'T use batteries, they have a USB cable (also many usb ports) that you just charge when your not playing! Some other features include the Playstation 2 compatability(software emulatioin), SACD support, flash card readers, 802.11 b/g Wi-Fi, a slot-loading 2x speed Blu-ray Disc drive for games, Blu-ray movies, DVDs, CDs, and other optical media, and numerous accessories for the console have been developed for the system, including the wireless Sixaxis controller, the BD Remote, the PlayStation Eye camera and the upcoming PlayTV DVB-T tuner/digital video recorder accessory.    Software: As for games, we all know that the Xbox 360 dominated 06' & 07', but contrary to popular belief, everyone thinks its time for the Playstation 3's comeback to start in 08'. The game list line-up its incredibly impressive.    Online Service: The number one thing is most definitally is that Playstation Network is FREE. Everyone loves the built-in internet browser, Wi-Fi, and media card readerscheck for browsing the internet and viewing it from your tv! You can also load various Operating Systems such as Linux! Not only that, but you can download a program that uses some of your computing power to help find a cure for cancer! (optional). Last but definitally not least, is the highly anticipated Playstation Home. The Playstation Home a new free-to-download community based service for the PlayStation Network, which allows users to create an avatar character for their PlayStation 3 system. This avatar will get its own apartment, which can be adorned by items players can receive in several ACHIEVEMENTS (yes, calling all achievement whores). Sony is also planning to expand this feature in the future, and they describe it as "a Second Life-like experience and will allow gamers everywhere to interact in a virtual world."    Cons:     Hardware: Well there really isn't any cons about that hard ware to list except when you go to buy a PS3, you have to buy either a 40GB, or an 80GB. According to wikipedia, there are 3 other choices with different pros and cons that aren't in production really.    Software: Yes we all  know that the Playstation 3 doesn't have as many games as the Xbox 360, but it will change very soon.    Online Service: I guess the old saying goes, you get what you paid for. But Sony has recognized this problem, they aware of it and they are working on it.|`|bW0qmR4yaa	this depends on 2 things  1. is online connectively a selling point for you?  2. do you know about the proprietary games    1. if playing games online means anything to you at all, then just go xbox360, everyone who plays a console online has xbox live and it just works, xbox is years ahead of what ps3 and wii can do in terms of online play.  2. this is the year for ps3, i'm no fanboi by any means but if you want to buy a ps3 at any point in time, this is the year, b/c now all the ps3 only games will come out for the ps3  god of war 3  killzone2  gran tourismo  ff13vs    true some games have gone from being platform specific, but some have stayed true and stayed exclusive, like these games(and more).    thats really your only criteria to go on, a blue ray play is not such a bonus anymore from 3years ago, now you can buy a decent blueray play for 150, heck if you want a new tv some big 40+ size tv's come w/ a blueray player or the store will throw one in to beat an internet deal. Plus depending on the size of your tv, you will not notice the difference between a max resolution of 720p(xbox) vs 1080p(ps3) unless you goto 40+ sizes in tvs and sit the appropriate distance.|`|dwEJMjkeaa	From a complete non fanboy view point I'd say go for the XBOX. It currently has more games, more high rated games, and Microsoft is basically paying every game company in the world to get Downloadable content for the XBOX 360 only.    The PS3s good games are Resistance : Fall of Man (It has a sequel named Resistance 2), Little Big Planet and Metal Gear Solid IV. There may be more but I just can't really think of any others right now.    Example: Fallout 3 DLC is only for 360 (and PC)                  Grand Theft Auto IV DLC is exclusive to 360|`|zX8QN7rQaa	1. why are you asking us?  2. why didn't you buy the xbox 360 earlier? now you only have 2-3 years left until the next xbox comes out, if you decided to buy a 360.  3. ps3 has 7 more years until ps4 comes out.    therefore, PS3 would be the wise choice, but I cannot tell you which to buy.    P.S. sorry if I sound like a douche, I just don't get why people ask Yahoo Answers about which game system they should buy.
9rXXU2kdaa	prob cuz when you unplug it the time restarts on the xbox which is basically how the gold cheat code for the game works. No you dont need live.|`|d8JsGUlCaa	Fable II calculates the money you earn by reading the internal clock on your Xbox. Unplugging it may slow or stop that internal clock altogether. Try leaving it plugged in next time, and see what happens.|`|a8tsrTCbaa	Unplugging the xbox resets the date/time, and because Fable II bases the money you earn off of the date/time you won't earn anything. Leave it plugged in if you want the money. Also with a little creativity here you can have all the money you want.|`|3E6Kz2ygaa	My husband played the whole game and when he bought and invested into properties, and turned off his ps3 when he was done playing for the day, he turned the system off, but I don't think it mattered if he unplugged it or not. The next day, because of his investments, his money added up, and since the game is time sensitive, that when the console gets turned on again, the money just appears in the top left corner with a plus sign. It has nothing to do with XBox live. Make sure you bought something that makes money for you in the long run. Make sure the business that you bought is doing it's job. Hint... Warning, the following is a spoiler: Also you can invest into the guy that asks you for money to help build a small town, and he asks for your investment. Do it. I earns alot of money, he is successful at making the town beautiful.

DfPyyDssaa	Locations  In the construction site in Fort Staunton (only until Grand Theft Aero) In the Cartel mansion in Cedar Grove Near D-Ices phone in Wichita Gardens Driving around Fort Staunton and Cedar Grove.|`|g8kIjpwSaa	LIBERATOR-                    Rewards: $40,000    Now, as soon as you start, a text mission  will appear on the  screen telling you to head north to Fort Staunton to find a Columbian gang car AKA, the Cartel cruiser. It's a big blue truck with a white bar on the back. Anyways, grab one (there's literally dozens in Fort Staunton) and head towards the pink radar dot. Stop outside the gate and it will open. Now, drive through and run over the first Columbian you see.      Now, trample all the others in the area. Careful though, because they all have AK47s. If your engine lights on fire, hop out. There is a car in almost every garage around you. Now, there are two closed garages at the end of the area. Go over to them. Go through the one on the right. Kill the Columbian here and get out of the car. Go and talk to the oriental gentleman. Now, get back in the car and he'll get in with you.  Drive all the way back to the Love Media building to complete the mission.      [ALTERNATE STRATEGY]      First do as it says and go get a Cartel Cruiser!! After that get a few   grenades or molotovs and drive to the place where the Asian guy is. Don't go to close to the fence because you don't want to open it-yet! So park the car a few feet away and go right to the fence. Lob a few grenades and/or molotovs. this will kill most of the Columbians and leave about two or three left!! Run over the rest of them with cartel cruiser. When you have to open the garages to find the Asian man. In case he is in the garage you pick run away immediately to lure the Columbian out so there is no danger in killing the Asian man! After you get him go to the little pink dot.
7g0OrPu9aa	Zombie decks loves to abuse returns from the graveyard, so your biggest fear is probably a Dimensional Fissure or a Macro Cosmos. So be prepared for them. I personally have 2 Dimensional Fissures in my side deck just in case I'm facing Lightsworn or Zombies. I run a Gladiator Beast deck and they hardly every have monsters in the grave. So by me having 2 Compulsory Evacuation Device, 2 Thunder King Rai-Oh, 2 Dimensional Fissures, and 3 Solemn Judgments, your deck is screwed. I suggest having staples like MST and Heavy Storm in your deck. Also, have 3 Solemn Judgments to disrupt your opponents flow. Half your life points may be worth it in the end. Also, a or 2 Phoenix Wing Wind Blast would also be good to protect your zombies. Hoped this helped|`|Zf34QwMCaa	im just going to give you a rough deck list thats good and you can go from there    DAD x2(if to expensive i would personally go for despair from the dark x2)  pyramid x3  zombie master x3  plaguespreader x3 (if to expensive then krebons x3)  mezuki x3  il blud   red eyes zombie dragon   ryu kokki x2  spirit reaper    zombie world x3  allure of darkness x2  card of safe return x2  book of life x3  monster reborn  heavy storm  MST  brain control  shrink x2  emergency teleport (if you decide to add krebons and if you cant afford these try running mystic tomato x2)    torriental tribute  mirror force  solemn judgment x3( or royal decree x3)    as i said this is a rough but freely make changes to make it your own personal deck such as adding everling underworld cannon etc. hope this helped

fRkZLEX5aa	Joo Suck -.^ Maybe you're just playing more challenging players? >.>|`|e9vUf1Zpaa	There is a very old reaction in Halo games that involve players having to pick up the good weapons that can own a fair amount.     Here's a good strategy for sniping.  Get up on an obscure ledge. From there, look down on any popular weapon spawn sites, especially the one that has the needler or sniper rifle. Wait until someone stops there to pick that weapon up, then when someone does, aim at their head quickly and fire. If you missed, hide quickly. Chances are that your target probably saw the streak or if you hit and KOed, the camera on their computer may spin to briefly show your hideout. After trying this many times I was able to score 10+ kills within 5 minutes.      Hope that helps.|`|YSmYkc5Yaa	Nobody on here can tell you why you can't play lately. Lol. Honestly though, everybody has their off days.    I'm a 40 in Team Snipers right now and just the other day I couldn't get a kill if someone payed me. I was doing terrible. So I didn't play for a day or two and went back in and went +15/20 almost every game.    People have bad days in Halo, it happens to everyone. You'll get out of your rut.    Edit- I play with my sensitivity on 1. Lol. I'm a very low sensitivity but I find it helps me a lot with sniping. I'm not as twitchy. I'm a good sniper too so I'm sure it helps. And I agree with your team, you need a good team to go in with or else you're not going to win if your team mates aren't very good.|`|ZntkO9ffaa	You just suck.|`|z6GVKxBIaa	Play call of duty|`|c53w7vDzaa	dont just play snipers i hate people that only play with brs just be good with any weapon and u suck cause your not chuck norris|`|YdD200a6aa	It's probably just a temporary problem... playing more will only make the problem worse and you'll become more frustrated. You should give team snipers a rest for a day or two.. play something else - either another playlist or another game in general.
Ga8sGuyRaa	lol, the novelty's probably worn off by now but I suggest you watch Harry Potter.|`|AA10949589	Have someone set it up ahead of time to dare you to kiss the boy OR girl you like. and there you go.|`|GNtWomekaa	this might be weird but  at my friends party we played strip spin the bottle  its spin the bottle but everytime the bottle land on you  you take off a piece of clothing  its heaps of fun.    the chocolate game is fun.   you still in a circle with a choc block and dress up clothes in the middle.  go around the circle, everyone taking turns to roll 2 dice.   if you roll a double, you go into the circle, put on the clothes  then with a knife and fork, eat some chocolate.  when another person in the circle rolls a double, they go into the middle and you go back out.    truth or dare is always a hit.  here are some truths and dares for you to use:  http://www.partypop.com/forums/General/m...    have fun :)
HVQFVtelaa	Kenny's answer looks good, but I dunno. I get bored when the game whips my butt.|`|vzZE0ktYaa	It is mostly chance, but I suppose you could improve your focus which would mean missing less moves. Also, there are several variations of the game which require more stategy, such as freecell.|`|P7u4WjWmaa	Just loads of practice, After a while you get used to the sort of moves that can be made. My Dad's girlfriend is amazing at it, you Just have get the knack of it.|`|94tBGHWLaa	The following are some tips on how to play Klondike otherwise commonly known as Solitaire. The tips assume the game has unlimited redeals and that the cards are dealt one card at a time.    Do not build with cards from the hand or wastepile unless they are being used to uncover a facedown card. Before doing any building you might want to go through the hand cards to see what cards you have that can be used to uncover facedown cards.     Try to uncover facedown cards from the highest columns first since potential blocks in the layout which could cost you the game are most likely here.     Do not build cards on foundations unless doing so helps to uncover a facedown card. Not building the cards on foundations allows other cards to be built upon them on the tableau.

QfQfefx3aa	I believe the game you are talking about is Bubble Trouble. They have also made a sequel to this game called Bubble Struggle 2: REBUBBLED.  You can find this game on various online game sites such as addictinggames.com, miniclip.com, and they have their own website at http://www.bubble-struggle.com.|`|9CEW093maa	Sounds like Asteroids to me. :P    Try google for games 'similar to asteroids'.

I played this a couple times when I was younger, it was released in 1986 so I'm not sure how old you're thinking, but I thought it could be it...

gkoOThQAaa	Metal gear is one of the best games ever made, it made me quite addicted even though I don't get excited about games as much as I used to 10 years ago. My list may be a bit weird but I will list the games that got me most excited at the time.    Metal Gear solid 4 on the ps3  God of war 2 on the ps2  Winning eleven 6 on the ps2  Tomb raider 4 on the pc  Company of heroes on the pc    Other games I was thrilled playing: Heavenly sword, Uncharted, God of war, Return to castle wolfenstein, mortal kombat 3, street fighter 2, resident evil (3,4), Tomb raider underworld (If it wasn't for the camera issues), Fifa 09.|`|xIcsFhRzaa	hggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg...|`|15wwA3jjaa	Honestly I really didn't like it, call me crazy but that's how I feel about it.  I played for about 20 minutes and then packed it up and sent it back, I don't know, Metal Gear 2 was my favorite.|`|lbgoHgDkaa	MGS4 was a very good game and the series as a whole was very well done.    1. Final Fantasy X  2. Metal Gear Solid 4  3. Tales of the Abyss (probably the best game almost nobody heard of)  4. Xenosaga I (haven't played Xenosaga 3 yet, but i'm anticipating it to make my top 5)  5. Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance|`|Npi4QR7Maa	 5 is Kingdom Hearts II      At  4 is Resident Evil 4      The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is at  3 for me      The legend of Zelda A Link to the Past at  2      And at  1          METAL GEAR SOLID 4 GUNS OF THE PATRIOTS!!!
a8tsrTCbaa	If you play on their servers you have to pay, or you can try to get on a private server which is usually free but altered in some way.|`|1T0MQ5zwaa	Yes, you have to pay monthly to play WoW, and if you are into fantasy roleplaying genre games, then it is worth it.    I've played it and I got hooked and can't stop playing.
uSFS3BETaa	To answer your question, if the contract stated only this than the most they can sue, if it would even be called that, would be 172$ because that would be a refund.  I could not find specific court cases which i am sorry for, but i have found someone in somewhat of a similar situation. If you reference the terms of agreement from blizzard stating that:  E. Blizzard Entertainment does not recognize the transfer of Accounts, and any authorized transfer of the World of Warcraft software (as set forth on the worldofwarcraft.com website) will result in the permanent deletion of the Account attached to that software. You may not offer any Account for sale or trade, and any such offer is a violation of this Agreement and may result in suspension or termination of the Account.  And, granted, you are willing to have the account deleted then this should be enough to stop the suit. This company may stop at that moment because blizzard would become involved and possibly shut down the company for its illegal usage of WoW accounts.    I hope this helped.|`|sShHZVsNaa	You should be sued for stealing the account.|`|xIcsFhRzaa	my bro plays this game and it's very easy. He owned a party and it IS LEGAL!!!|`|m0a7Ox1maa	I'd tell em to p[iss off, would cost them more then that to sue you.  also are they even in the same country as you?    Technically, neither you or the company own the account as it's owned by Blizzard|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	Answer is, yes you can and are being sued.  What you have done is classified as stealing.  Good luck with that.|`|AA12328571	I'm surprised this will hold up in court, like that episode in Judge Judy,   g/f breaks up with boyfriend cause he played to much WoW and didnt pay rent, Judge Judy responds World Of What, is that a computer game or something, LMAO  Besides selling your account is a breach of WoW Tos, so not much can be done so i say give them the account, start a new one and all will be good.|`|381e3207230460fe8521d523304a91a6aa	Just because you thought you got ripped off doesn't mean that you  have the right to steal something back.      When you sold it, you agreed to be paid 172 bucks.  If you didn't like it, you could have asked for more, but you didn't.  Just because the company was able to sell it to someone else for 500 bucks doesn't give you the right to steal it back.    The company can ask you to pay 500 bucks because that's how much the value is worth to the company.  Someone is willing to pay 500 bucks, so the company can say  that the value is 500 bucks.    As for the EULA, take it up with Blizzard.  Best case is that the account will be banned, and then you'll be asked to pay the 172 back to the company, as if the exchange didn't take place.  Worst case scenario, Blizzard bans the account, and you'll have to pay the company.|`|bx63jJVnaa	The reason they'd be asking for $500 is because you basically stole $500 from them.  They have to repay the guy you took the account from the $500 back since he no longer has an account.

The animation usually took so long I was dead before I got into the car.  Climbing walls and stairs takes too long also.  And also take out the feature that makes you fly out of the car when you hit something. I HATE that!|`|EN8ojMpPaa	real cars and planes !! not just made up  maybe parachutes to avoid taking damage from high ground   (like saints row2 )  more weapons as well !  maybe real cities as well    it should also allow full customization of vehicles
xjy0eDdEaa	One was blind and the other couldn't, see    So they chose a dummy for a referee.    A blind man went to see fair play,    A dumb man went to shout "hooray!"      A paralysed donkey passing by,    Kicked the blind man in the eye,    Knocked him through a nine inch wall,    Into a dry ditch and drowned them all,      A deaf policeman heard the noise,    And came to arrest the two dead boys,    If you don't believe this storys true,    Ask the blind man he saw it too!
SdHqyWKHaa	The clear circles are supposed go on the back of the ruler to help make it stay in place better and slip less when you're using it - they're slightly sticky when placed on fabric or paper. Fiskars describes them as 'no-skid rubber feet'.   I'd never seen that warning on just a Fiskars ruler before, so I assumed it must apply to the dots, that the chemical is in either the adhesive on the dots or in the plastic they're made from. However, I also did some checking on the Fiskars website (link below), which indicates that when California's Proposition 65 passed, they put precautionary labels on all their products to comply with the new law, and that they're removing the labeling as they have a chance to review product formulas and prove they're safe. There likely has never actually been a problem with either the ruler or the dots.   Incidentally, I tried dots like that on one of my rulers when I first started quilting and I found that while they DID reduce slipping a little, they created other problems, and I ended up getting rid of them. I think if you don't use the dots, you'll be safe, and you won't be missing anything good if you don't use them.   http://www.fiskarscrafts.com/aboutus/pro...|`|eTOrwG1Maa	That warning is on so many things.  If you are worried, I would try contacting Fiskars directly and ask what they are referring to.

E8VKvndjaa	To spread Pokerus through your team, you put the pokemon that is infected in the second spot in your party. Then have 5 other pokemon you want to catch pokerus in the other spots. Get into any pokemon battle (trainer or wild pokemon) and win the battle. It will gradually spread through your team (this may take a while) =D     Another Important thing to know is that if your pokemon has pokerus and is in your party for any longer than 24 hours at once, it will wear off. To avoid this happening just Put your Pokemon in your PC each day.     I hope this helped!|`|zfETtcYJaa	battle pokemon and it should spreed put one in the pc so u could keep the pokerus|`|G3ScsO6haa	put pokemon either in the same box in your pc or a easier way is to put it in your party pokemon and battle to spread it|`|mOTCr8Pxaa	Just leave it on your team and it will spread by walking and battling. But it only stays for 24 hours and after that it's gone. Be sure to deposit a infected pokemon so you have it when you decide to ev train.

Dso7k3sjaa	Well, yes, you can get a no-cd crack to play it with, but you do have to know where to put it.  I can give you a link where the first post on the link explains where to go to get one and where to put it after you do get it.    http://www.moreawesomethanyou.com/smf/in...    Just scroll down until you see  4.  I know it seems like they are talking about a different game, but use their instructions just get the correct one for the game you're playing.    Or, you can read EA's article about this problem and try that instead, it's up to you:    https://easims.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/easi...    To be honest though, this is actually caused by the Securom that's on the disk, so my first link would work best.|`|9HWexOtEaa	Did you put in the right disc? There are two discs, and you have to insert disc one. Also if you have any expansion packs, you insert the first disc of the one that came out the most recently. Also are you sure it's the real thing? Did you buy it from a store or over the internet from a reliable place (i.e. Wal-Mart, Amazon)? If you didn't, it may be fake.|`|Oy7AGmCUaa	Sounds like you have a copied version of the sims 2 or it is not reading the TOC on the cd, your next bet would be to get a NOCD crack off the internet.

I have never seen a book on them for I would have bought it. They were used as an item given after one completed a rite. Carried as a good luck piece. If you go to ebay you will find them for sale. If there is a Mason Lodge in your area go ask them about it. They may be able to give you an address. Also try doing a search for them on the web. There are collectors out there but without a reference guide most collectors leave them alone. Hope this helps some.

CjAFMQ8Gaa	Naruto games are all made crappily. I can't recommend either. The only good one is Rise of a Ninja on Xbox 360.|`|0iDmXV1gaa	ultimate ninja one for psp is a remake of the original story line for the psp and number two has it's own unique story line so i would say number two because t's new|`|eQOxKa04aa	i would rather the second one one coz naruto got razengan|`|A0OpUrNJaa	jasons right u shud get rise of the ninja cos its heaps good
wHCgSJCaaa	That's easy.    Go to the map area. (the third button on the top.)  Then on the map, look for the person named junkspy by moving your cursor to each village. junkspy should be within your 7x7 area. After he find junkspy and his coordinates, remember them and insert those coordinates to fulfill the travian beginner mission.
zozNBHcJaa	It is very good. If you're a KH fan you will like it. I know that many people think the card system is lame, but it's actually pretty good. The cards you find and buy are a random assortment, but you can make your own deck of cards and customize it to fit your needs. You also get cards from enemies and bosses you defeat, each with its own unique effect. The card system is pretty deep as well. Not to mention the fact that you can still level up. Pretty good storyline as well, and once you beat the game, you can start a new game and play as Riku, who has a completely separate story, so you get basically 3 games in one: A Kingdom Hearts game, a card battler, and two separate stories.    If you prefer graphics being better, then the PS2 version is right for you. The graphics on the GBA version are pretty sweet as well, mixing 2D and 3D pretty well from a somewhat overhead view. Personally I like the GBA version as this game suits the GBA control scheme rather well. The PS2 versions controls are decent but a little difficult to get used to at first, but each game has its own unique points as well|`|YzhYFu0eaa	It's decent.  It's nothing like the ones on PS2.  It has more of a card collecting angle to it, which might scare off some people.|`|G3ScsO6haa	why did you mention it on GBA when it is only out on any sony like PS2 PS3 and PSP     the PS2 one is way better than the GBA one    ps can u email me when the thrid one is coming out or out|`|uSFS3BETaa	I have only played the GBA one and it was fun. By now it is kind of outdated, but nonetheless. The card system is pretty unique but the cards are not random. As you kill the darkness and defeat each boss you will be given the cards and can use those cards to build your own decks that can be used in each battle.|`|vtJDHJDYaa	http://kingdomhearts.wikia.com/wiki/King...

If so tracking down cd1 on the internet should be no problem as replacement, but as it would be copied it will not read the TOC from the cd without a program like DAEMON tools anyways.
AA11542500	You can reset the CMOS by shorting the jumper.  It will remove the password.|`|elgVgRCRaa	This is always hilarious to see people try to solve. Jump the CMOS if its a desktop. If its a laptop look up the BIOS reset key combo used at startup for the brand and model.

ba94bcd24c2a874f6dc9a16978fb3762aa	Your system requirements might not be satisfactory for optimal gaming.    First I would recommend getting the box that the game came in and reading the requirements label on the side of it.    Next I would gauge what I have currently in my computer (video card, ram and processor speed) versus what the game manufacturer recommends.    If your system is not meeting their recommendations...It is time to upgrade the hardware or get a new computer if you wish to keep on playing.    Making an educated guess here...  It sounds like your video card is too old and needs to be upgraded.  The other two components I mentioned would be a bit less likely to cause dramatic issues unless your system is museum grade equipment.|`|AA10587091	you can do 1 of 2 things, 1 get more memory, you need at least 512 to play but 1gig or 2 is even better.  2 set your graphic on the lowest setting. if neither of these helps get a new computer.|`|xg7XhRMnaa	try clearing some space on your hard drive. that might be what is slowing you down.|`|iDgbE7D4aa	you need to get a graphics card....they can be pretty pricey ($100-$400) but it's worth it....

PxpSxoBzaa	You should develop your runecrafting ability. But if you absolutely *must* have runes without runecrafting, mine a bunch of rune essence and trade it to an experienced runecrafter in exchange for runes.      edited to add:    If you're going to kill things for runes, try giants. There are moss giants in the dungeon under verrock and on the island of crandor. There are hill giants ( the easiest I think) in the dungeon under edgeville.     They sometimes drop larger numbers of runes. They *always* drop big bones, which is good, since you can build up your prayer while you collect runes.|`|zSDUEjwGaa	well since your such a NOOB than just wait till your stats get higher so you can afford runes.or you can train your rc lvl so you can craft them|`|JMoxJYg1aa	go to the shop behind varrock bank to buy cheap runes.     only buy the first 700 before changing worlds in order to kepp the runes at low prices    death runes - 180 min normally 300    chaos runes - 100 min   normally 150    mine, air, fire, water - 4 each normally 20    big selections      portsarim- maggies rune shop is good as it  sells them for the same price maybe abiot cheaper but thestock is always in large numbers|`|AA11503759	make them|`|WELhHL71aa	Keep asking to go to the rune mountain place and keep getting rune essences to craft more and level up. and when you have more runes keep some in your bank and sell others.|`|4209f3d33a1b725417ad34b787c90a76aa	look around on the ground and usually people will sell them in bulk for cheap!

128b03f5cbdd1dfaf8b251c808f25c2baa	if you have bought the original game, i would provide you with the best cure for that stupid error. this is only if you have bought it:    1. go to the sims 2 cd 1 and open the folder CRACK. if you have this folder, it means you bought the original game, and you're saved.  2. if you open it, you'll see the sims 2 .exe or startup program. normally if you click it, it would start the game. but don't click it. copy it.  3. paste it inside your EA games>The Sims 2>TSBin folder (IN YOUR program files folder inside your c:/ drive).  4. start the game.    (if the game requires you to insert the cd, insert it. you can eject it safely after the game has loaded. you don't need the cd to play. you need it to start the game.)    but if you just installed the game using a download, it'll be a little more difficult and it's not my field of specialty anymore. so just good luck on that.|`|OhqBd5JOaa	right click on the  Deamon Tools Pro icon at the very bottom right hand side of your screen where the time isgo to Virtual CD/DVD-ROM pick your driver click mount.. then chose your disk Sims2 CD    You know i had the same problem i just dont think it will run with out the disk.. you should try copying the game to CDs and see if useing the CD will make it run...   it didnt work for me but you might have got it from a different Torrent so its worth a try.. i just had to end up buying the game...

w2xsd28Qaa	since schools block certain key words, you have to search without using those words.  the easiest way is to search in a different language.  try going to www.yahoo.de (yahoo in germany) and type in the name of the game and achievements.  the results will be close enough to english you can figure it out, but without using the words blocked by your school.|`|y1bheuZJaa	Schools have any sites blocked that contains gaming "language" so the best bet is to go to a public library & print it there.

RqM1TZXyaa	You may be required to wear certain footware, that covers your whole feet, depending on the park you are visiting.  I would advise on proper shoes, just to be safe,  and because thongs might easily fall of on ccertain rides.    Look up the website of the theme park that you are hoping to visit,  and it should say on there.|`|KbmP0xWhaa	i suggest you wear covered shoes, not thongs. cause they might fall off on the rides,. but you probs could wear them i you wated to. and if your inmelbourne - check out the luna park theme park or in sydney.    its awsome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    goodluck.|`|iR1pZ5VTaa	you can were thongs you just take em off when you go on big rides when the might fall off|`|1ykzSRtKaa	Nope.

I really can't remember since i've played 110 hours on my Pearl version and I do not wanna start a new game.|`|Kddjmy4Aaa	A good Amount.|`|MuXHjuj6aa	Its pretty obvious and really this is an irrelevant question. But who cares, i fell bored so i'll answer this question. Well, firstly you get about 700 poke in the first gym and around about 8000 through to the final gym badge. From these stats just make an approximate ratio. For example:  Gym 1: 700  Gym 2:1500  Gym 3: 2800  Gym 4: 4300  Gym 5: 5700  Gym 6: 6200  Gym 7: 7500  Gym 8: 8750    So the ratio is 700:1500:2800:4300:5700:6200:7500:8750    This would be my best guess unless you have an amulet coin which i think doubles how much poke you would get. So you would times each of the answers above by two.    However, I think that these values should have an extra 10%-25% more because these numbers look so small to me...    okeys...     If you like my answer then email nabby_b0y@hotmail.com    yea

fbc1e0976369953a458a3126eb4cbc0faa	Gamesharks can really be a good way to cheat, but they can often mess up games. I once had beaten a game, but when I tried my gameshark, I lost all data. A good rule of thumb is that if you don't understand what the cheat means, do not use it. Action Replays work much better than gamesharks.|`|4848338af78cd5e06da92f11d7fbda6caa	Game Sharks only give you cheats it nevermesses games up|`|AA12242717	Nope.|`|AA12183867	doubt it or else it wouldnt have been around since game genie for the original nintendo|`|AA10645177	Gamesharks only create "loopholes" so you can enjoy your game the way you want to, sure some people think its cheating. I usually use it once i beat my games once by myself and then i play them again with the cheat codes. If they would mess up your game then there wouldn't be a gameshark. just watch out for cheat code's editors or writers warnings since sometimes using more than one code can make your game freeze or crash..on some games and depending the console youre using.|`|844f468e872266488e6c339045d7ad44aa	Gameshark are like Drugs.

AA10453678	i don't know the exact answer to your question. I had a second life for about a second. the whole idea kind of freaked me. if I remember though you could "work" to make money. those were the drone like people mopping the floors and things. or you can make stuff and sell it. furniture and stuff like that.|`|vahn499Raa	what?|`|6P9PZAxRaa	Welcome to Second Life. It's been awhile since I played because of work but I can't wait to go back. Think of Second Life as real life but more fun. You can get jobs as a DJ, hosts at clubs, events. There is actually a way to search for jobs. If you won't pay real money, you can't have your own house per say but you can rent your home. If you are new, I would search for newbies and such. There are some place that offer items to newbies. I do need to let you know that some stuff will be very nice and some will be cheesy. There are some residents who will be nice and give you items if you need it but not all. I must WARN you to not take any surveys that take you outside of the game and on to the internet. It's probably a scam. I like to shop in the game so I go to DE, Cake Hair are 2 cool places that are modern but those are only a sample of places you can shop for clothing if you are a male. If you have an interest in rl, you can find it in-game. I know you said you don't want to use real money but if you ever do wish to, you can buy lindens. That is what the currency is called in-game. What are your interests? It'll be easier for me to direct you places if I know that. It's ok to email or im me. Ciao 4 now and Good Luck! You'll have lots of fun!|`|4He3bNO7aa	As I recently said to someone else here, this whole idea of finding a job straight away is not a good one. You are just going to end up getting very frustrated. There simply aren't enough jobs for every new resident who joins SL.    The most common way for new residents to make money is camping. You find a place where there are specific things that pay you money, such as mopping a floor, painting walls or serving food. You get a few lindens an hour. The truth is that it will take you days (if not weeks) of camping to make enough to buy something. During that time, your avatar is restricted to being in one location doing nothing but sitting on a pose earning a tiny ammount of money. If you were to calculate the cost of elctricity to have your computer running doing nothing at all, you would find that you are working for a negative profit. In other words, it's costing you more to camp than you are earning. What many new residents don't realise, is that L$1000 costs $4.80 USD. You would have to camp in SL for a week or more to earn that. Factor in that if you crash, you lose all you earned during that camping session and you may start to realise that you are wasteing precious days of your life for nothing.    Making things can be profitable, but no matter how you look at it, you have to invest money to make money. You also have to learn the skills, spend time making things and then you have to be making something people want at a price they can afford. It takes a long time to develop the skills to make really good quality merchandise in SL and there is a lot of competition.    Any modelling job or danceing job requires you to have an attractive avatar. That means a good skin, shape, hair and eyes as well as some good clothes. Again, you need to have money before you can make money.    So we're really down to two options.     First is to go to Hippypay and do the online surveys. They're not bad and pay reasonably well, but you do tend to get a lot of spam coming into your email inbox.    The second option is to enter your credit card details and just buy money. You saw the exchange rate earlier in my reply. Be honest - $5 isn't much. Here in the UK, that's a pint of beer in the pub or two large bottles of Coke. If you start to have fun in SL, it's a small price to pay to have a good time. Most likely you will want to spend more than that, but as long as you don't go crazy, it's cheaper than a lot of hobbies. A combination of hippypay and buying money may be the ideal solution.    This is very important if you want a house - even one you build yourself for nothing - because you have to buy the land AND pay monthly tier. So for a comfortable plot for a house, you will have to find at least L$17,000 to buy the land, plus (at the very least) L$5500 per month for tier fees. And to rub salt into the wounds, you need to pay that tier on top of the cost of the land for the first month. If this sounds daunting, then just be aware that a lot of people buy land plots much bigger than this. Mine cost L$13,500 in tier fees each month alone. In my defence, I'm getting older now and my days of going out to pubs or clubs is long behind me, so I spend my money on Second Life.    Jinxxed 0: Thanks for that update on Hippiepay. It was something I never used because you had to be in the USA to participate, so I just bought money. Good to know for when others ask about making cash in SL, so a thumbs up for that.|`|q3qbk99Raa	hippie pay would be a good way to make lindens, but if you actually used it, you'd know hippie pay has been shut down for almost half a year.    metaRL.com is pretty much the only survey site thats great for making lindens. its way better than hippie pay also because it doesnt force you take surveys. you can play games and refer other people.    you dont even need land to get referals like you do with other survey sites.

1MLIYilNaa	Just play games that you are good at.    To level up you can go to the Swashbuckling Academy ( http://www.neopets.com/pirates/academy.p... ) and pay the guy with Dubloons (you can buy them using the shop wizard) and after a couple of hours you go back and click 'complete course' (something like that) then your neopet will increase it's level by 1.    Once your pet is off level 1 you can go to Count Von Roo (http://www.neopets.com/worlds/deadlydice... ) everyday at Midnight NST and play Deadly Dice and that can increase it's level by 1. (or sometimes 2, if you tie with him. If you tie with him and win the next round, you'll get an avatar) You can loose a level (or 2) if you loose to him.. but I have a tip: If you click 'roll the dice' on an odd second, you'll win every time.    The best way to get items while your on a quest is to ask a neofriend to search it by using the shop wizard, or you could create a side account and open it in a different browser (eg. Firefox/Internet Explorer) or just log out of your main, search it with your side, then log back into your main and buy it.    Make sure your pets are fed (put them in the neolodge http://www.neopets.com/neolodge.phtml for an entire moth for just 140NP's each. Just select the cheapest option and don't select any of the extras. They'll be fine. You won't have to feed them and they'll be bloated the entire time)  and give them a plushie or something to play with. It usually makes them happy.

Oy7AGmCUaa	Hi, the game is not real time, it passes pretty fast (not too fast to get things done) about 1 min is a bit less than an hour in game.  It can be a very slow game if you do everything you can do in a day, everyday.  But if you just water your crop and feed your animals, there is nothing stopping you from turning in bed early to force faster growth =)    The game is not hard at all, its very enjoyable.  Clearing the weeds from your farm, breaking down the wood and stone to clear room for crops is fun.  Not to mention making grass patches for animals to graze on.  The game has hours and hours of replay and a heck of alot to do.  I personally love this game (huge can of the harvest moon series) and would re-add it to my collection without a doubt.    The game also has festivals which have mini games, this adds for excitement and gives you something to look forward to in your virtual world.  The only part of this game that is frustrating is re-weeding your farm =P    Buy it buy it!!! (P.S. you cannot die in this game, only faint from excess work, but your animals can die of old age and being sick)
4nROh3yOaa	When you are around 32 construction you can make oak carved tables at your workbench in your house,    If money is not a problem for you then, buy about 20 ring of dueling (8), about 100 house teleport tabs, and about 1500 oak planks. If you run out of any supply just buy more    You start of by having all your teletabs in your inventory(they stack on top of each other), and wear a ring of dueling, and all the space you have left in your inventory you fill with oak planks    you then teleport to your house and go to work bench and keep making carved oak tables until you have no planks, then you use ring of duelling to teleport to castle wars, which has a bank right next to tele spot,     here you withdraw more planks then teleport to house and repeat process,     using this method i was able to get from 32 to 50 construction in under an hour,    hope this helps you|`|fkQWYStLaa	If you plant stuff in your garden, you get both farming and construction xp.

The market for platform consoles is much higher than hand helds, and to go hand in hand with that the ratio of game quality is higher as well.

8xDSKf3Maa	you shouldnt use it.    it can stuff your pc.
WbIaudCDaa	You can go with Dead Silence or a combination of silenced gun and footsteps if you really wanna mess with the enemy. But seeing as it's an MP40 I think the safest bet is Silenced gun with Steady Aim, that way you have deadly offense & defense when combined with Juggernaut.  Keep your distance and they'll have a hard time seeing/hearing you while you run circles around them.|`|o4N6xr46aa	For search and destroy make sure you SILENCE your wep btw, and id say anything stealthy.|`|ZpJTeA0aaa	if u survive long enough like me without dying u should use bandolier . this gives u lots of ammo .
7ZOomG95aa	You need to get a rifle, and there is an infared scope in one of the rooms. Once you get that when you equip it to the rifle, you can see the enemies' infected spots. You shoot THOSE and ONLY those to kill the enemy, if you shoot it anywhere else it will regenerate HP and will make you use more ammo to kill it.    You shouldn't have to start over, it will just be hard. If you can backtrack to the last merchant do so. Buy a rifle, sell your mine thrower if you need to. (I beat the game with the red9, rifle, broken butterfly, and TMP I suggest those weapons over ALL others.) DO NOT use the rifle on ANY other not zombie besides the regenerators, you are going to need to conserve ammo. Shoot carefully and good luck!|`|jJKchzfcaa	You need a rifle. Once you enter the freezer room you will find an infrared scope which lets you see each plaga that keeps the Regenerator alive.
S89Nk9ejaa	left 4 dead is a cooperative first person shooter, that falls in the survival-horror genre, you have to fih your way through set levels with your buddies, and team work is essential. hawks, is an arcadeish flight combat game, that pits you against different factions, and that ties into the tom clancy universe, i would recommend left 4 dead if you have xbox live gold membership, and a lot of buddies to play with.|`|cJypdHvbaa	Im sorry but both are good games.  so buy one, save your cash and buy the other.  i suggest Left 4 Dead First.|`|2AcUxVZxaa	um...H.A.W.K.S. is really good.if you have STEAM then hell yeah H.A.W.K.S is the way to go but if you have xbox 360 then you have to trust your instincts and get which ever one your guts tell you to.my STEAM account is j03l95.|`|8quzYAOqaa	Left 4 Dead is streets better than HAWX...  Its a must play. The multiplayer MOD IS really ADDICTIVE..  The single player campaign is also AWSuM.                                HAWX is NO match for Left 4 Dead!!!|`|ZpJTeA0aaa	yea u should buy left for dead 1st and btw who doesnt know bout left for dead its a fps zombie game where u basically play like a few stages and you just hav to shoot your way till the end of the level
AA11997820	startrek elite force|`|AA12226837	why would anyone like star trek??? i dont understand wtf man why???? email me the answer at operation_49@yahoo.com plz|`|AA10874965	Star Trek: Elite Force is a good game if you like the 'Quake'-style games where you run around and shoot aliens.    Also, i've heard people say that Stark Trek TNG 'A Final Unity' is a good game too... although its's one of the older ones made.    One of the newest games released is 'Shattered Universe'.. it looks really cool!    If you like games where you control the actions of the ship, Star Trek: Bridge Commander has got good reviews.    Another of my favourites is Starship Creator: Warp 2. In this you choose what crew members you want, design your own custom ship, and you can even import your own photo so that you can be the Captain of your own ship. You then take the ship on different mission, this is more stratergy based.|`|AA12266868	It's an older game, called Star Trek: Judgement Rites. You can still find it at abandonware sites, and it's a fine adventure game.  Star Trek: 25th Anniversary was nearly as good plus if you got the enhanced edition you could even hear the voices of all the original actors playing their characters. I don't work for Interplay; I'm just a fan. :) Give 'em a try. Good luck.
AA12266868	Essentially infinite. Once you reach the highest rank they give you more stars, as previously stated, and the game just keeps on going.|`|AA11037524	I have no idea, when you reach the title 'Bookworm Supreme' ( I think it is around level 30 plus or something)     The next title would be Bookworm Supreme Level 1, Bookworm Supreme Level 2, Bookworm Supreme Level 3, and so on....The   highest level I got was Bookworm Supreme Level 4. I forgot what level it was. Sorry.
AA10468617	Ask Ash or Misty....|`|4641802685152ab878f001495db6b20aaa	Ok, pay attention. Get relicanth and wailord. Put reliacnth in the first place and wailord in last. Go to the southeast part of Route 134 and dive into the water. Go to the dive-able area (kinda hard but try) and, well,. dive! Go to the top and read the brail. The screen will shake and and it will unlock the regis. To find registeel go to the volcano in the southwest region of Route 120, go to the centre, and FLY! FLY FOR YOUR LIFE! Now you fight registeel. Regirock:fly to lavaridge, bop down the mountain, and enter the desert. In the southern part of the desert, you will find a cavern. Enter it, then walk up to the center tile at the top of the room. Go three steps down and two steps right. Use strength to open the passage to Regirock. To find Regice, in Route 105, there is an island on the west side that has a mountain on it. Go there, enter, and stand in front of the tile. Press A, read it, press A again, and do not do anything else. The door will open after twenty seconds, and the last Regi is yours. You never have to use the Master Ball to catch all the legendary Pokemon. You can catch them all with about 60 Great Balls. However, you might need to use a Master Ball against the last one in the tower.|`|9e17e537935ee97d0f10ae71c4a5be72aa	http://www.gamespot.com/gba/rpg/pokemone...

Hands down is the 360 for me.     It has amazing capabilities. Grandted the PS2 has more games right now but, they will be fazed out soon.     The 360 has much better graphics. The GameCube was fun for Zelda & Mario Kart. But, the variety just isn't there. It's much too child orintated.|`|AA11128798	I haven't played one, but i'm sure the Xbox 360 is by far the better as it is the newest and technology doesn't go backwards. The original Xbox is way better than any of the others, so i think it'd be safe to say the 360 is the best.|`|6125aca6bba27428c3f47db63f5f2cc6aa	Yeah man its better much more. its more better technology. its much more modern for now. but wait a little bit. in the end of 2006 PS3 will come and its will be the best game platform for entertainment. I think for 2007 the leader is the PS3. thnx!|`|AA10715163	im going to do it from the  horryfying to the best it starts off like this  gamecube,ps,xbox360,ps2,xbox\  Now the one i really really like is the xbox but the playstation is also awesome i say you play both of em|`|AA10376085	It depends.If you willing to spend the money and you like X-BOX games then you get X-BOX 360.If you want something cheaper yet not bad you get PS2.If you wanna get Ripped off you wait for PS3 to come out.PS3$=500/600 Xbox360$=300/400 wii$=200-250.|`|AA12007898	i am going to say the equally sucks. see for ps2 its been pretty old. so no one would blame it if it sucks. but xbox 360?! come on, over heat, and everything. the graphic isn't that good as it suppose to be. all it does is just make it brighter. thats all. people are seriously concerning ps3 right now. since its god blue ray disc. which each one of the disc holds 25gb/layer. the graphic and the game detail will definitly be increditable.|`|dfe1f47633be516db702cbcadc790466aa	xbox 360 is good but ps2 is better.Ps2 is the best ps xbox.........etc.|`|AA11996828	well as far as technical specs go yes the XBOX 360 is better|`|AA12092556	Of course it's better.  It's like comparing an N64 to the PS2.  Right now the 360 doesn't really have any good games, but it will soon.  The lineup they showed at E3 looks way fun (NFS Unlimited, Halo 3, etc.)  I'm getting one.

AA12266868	I haven't tested it, but if an old game no longer runs on a modern computer it's because modern computers no longer use DOS as a base engine (as even some of the early Windows did.)

The fence around the cows was electrified, so one of my friends got the shock of his life trying to get in the area.  We convinced another (drunk) friend that he had to lean down beside the leg of the cow and as we pushed it, it would fall over him.  He actually crouched down beside the cow's leg.  When the cow began to turn towards him, we all made a mad dash back over the fence and called it a night.  No one got hurt, and the cow didn't actually tip.|`|AA10759533	funny as hell they just fall over its just to funny|`|bcb74a00410c11ce2a8f1c2ae2350e68aa	Its a myth.

Februar 2003  Genre: Rollenspiel  Spieler: 1  Features:  keine    Es gibt viele RPG-Serien in Japan. Die bekanntesten sind Dragon Quest (Dragon Warrior in den USA) von Enix und Final Fantasy von Square. Diese Mammutserien z?hlen bis jetzt sieben bzw. elf Teile und einige Spin-Offs. Doch es gibt noch viel mehr, eher kleinere Serien wie Suikoden von Konami, Grandia von Game Arts oder eben Wild Arms von Contrail. Das einzigartige an Wild Arms ist die Atmosph?re: Keine andere Serie, ja kein anderes RPG, hat je im Wild West Ambiente gespielt. Dnen, Wastelands, Feuerwaffen, das sind alles Punkte, die nur in der Wild Arms Serie vorkommen und heben diese drei Rollenspiele sehr von der breiten Masse ab (bezglich Locations und Atmosph?re).

5dc482600c78d0619c781d632d8d0369aa	I use the sims2pack clean installer to install the sims2 installable packs.  You can get the sims2pack clean installer from http://www.modthesims2.com/index.php? , when you have this, you should have the option to open the sims2 installable pack with this program.  I like using this program because if you download a house that contains a hack (that you might not want), you have the option of installing everything except that hack.  Keeps unwanted things out of your game. If you have any hacks in your game and you accidentally put one in that conflicts with the one already in your game, it can cause the game to crash or not respond.  Also, if you download extras for your game, a lot of times you end up with duplicates or with a lot of empty files in your sims2 downloads folder, you can find these with the sims2pack clean installer and it allows you to delete these files without having to try and hunt them all down.

Halo 2 had new weapons like the energy sword, (my favorite) and had great Xbox live and new maps.

As someone who's played them both, I like H2 better.    Halo 1 was the first BIG FPS for the Xbox. It was the main reason most people even bought the first console from Microsoft. It had decent graphics and smooth gameplay. However, the weapons were very unbalanced. The Assault Rifle was automatic and very inaccurate. The pistol had a scope and could kill someone in 3 shots. It also was the game that started MLG (Major League Gaming), the biggest professional gaming league for Xbox.    Halo 2 was an even bigger FPS. It was the main game that made the Xbox the supreme console. The weapons became balanced, and Xbox Live allowed you to game with millions of people. The campaign was just as good, if not worse, than Halo 1's. The graphics are extraordinary, and it is a staple game for professional gamers. Probably the best multiplayer game ever.    Those are the pros and cons. I can't tell you which is better, as it is a matter of opinion.

It's helpful to level up Final Form so you can use Glide to avoid the cards on the ground. If he turns you into a card or die just get in close and keep hitting him so he can't attack you as often.

If you need more help check www.gamefaqs.com|`|ff0996d863d5bc21e9aa07e9b7a81fc0aa	This fight will proceed a bit differently from other fights. Instead of HP, |  | Luxord has a time meter at the top of the screen. Sora does too. The        |  | advantage lies with Luxord, however; Sora can still die by loss of HP. When |  | the battle first begins, Sora is turned into dice Sora. At this point, all  |  | you can do is jump around. Don't try to hit Luxord, as you'll just end up   |  | hurting yourself on the cards. Just run away from him until Sora turns back |  | (once the Drive Gauge reaches 0).                                           |  |                                                                             |  | Now that the battle's begun, it's time to keep an eye on your time gauge.   |  | Whoever runs out of time first will lose the battle, so technically, you    |  | can win if you have the slightest advantage at the end of the battle. It's  |  | best to try to get a buffer though, in case things go wrong later in the    |  | battle.                                                                     |  |                                                                             |  | Keeping your MP up is key during this battle, since Sora loses HP so fast.  |  | Attacking Luxord's cards will cause a lot of MP Balls to appear. Also, if   |  | you kept MP restorative items in your item slots, that will help as well.   |  | Although Luxord doesn't have an HP gauge, attacking him will cause his time |  | gauge to lower slightly faster. This is important for later, when you are   |  | subjected to his games. In case you lose, you will have an easier time      |  | catching your time gauge up with Lux's.                                     |  |                                                                             |  | One of the games you'll see is a card game. Run up to him when he           |  | challenges you, and hit Triangle. Cards will spin around Sora, and the      |  | command menu will scroll many Xs and an O. This is exactly like the Gambler |  | minigame; just wait until the scrolling O gets slow and hit X when it       |  | crosses the top command box. This will cause Luxord to lose a lot of time   |  | and release HP Balls. Losing will cause Sora to turn into a card. You can   |  | actually attack as a card, but it's still not recommended.                  |  |                                                                             |  | When Luxord turns into a card, you'll have to pick him out amongst a series |  | of other cards flying around the area. You'll want to try to be as          |  | accurate as possible. Use Flip to turn the cards around. Flipping a blank   |  | card (turn the camera to see what's on the other side of the cards) won't   |  | do anything, but flipping one with a clock on the back will cause you to    |  | lose time, and the ones with the balls of fire on the back will hurt you.   |  |                                                                             |  | When Luxord's time is almost out, he'll litter the floor with dozens of     |  | cards. At this point, he'll teleport around and start slicing at you with   |  | cards viciously. You can run from these attacks fairly easily (especially   |  | if you have any of the Drive Form abilities). After that, he'll appear at   |  | the far end of the area, and Sora runs after him automatically. A wall of   |  | huge cards appear around Sora, and you need to get four O commands on each  |  | box in the command menu to win this little game.

I think OFB is worth buying.  You can manage your own store and make your own products (if you want) or you could sell stuff that you dont make.  i think it's really fun. For example, my Sim had 10 cooking skill points, and i made him own a bakery.  another Sim came with a restaurant, and you could really serve and host and stuff. i just thought it was really fun. i would recommend buying it. you can sell toys, robots, and flowers. AND if you have a Gold Badge in Robotics, you can make Servos, which are like people, but their only needs are fun, social, environment, and power. it's like the perfect employee.|`|603a621fea41cf69a1ebb0bcbd5b273faa	do not get sim open for business it is sorry|`|6e4aa4d8f709fe53bc2657ea0ae3297baa	Sims 2 University is OK.  Sending Sims through college gets them lots of benefits, it just takes too much time to get them through.  Fastest way through is to make sure you only have one or two sims in a household (which means no dorms).  Any more than that and you're spending too much time pausing to make sure everyone's needs are met.    OFB is a better expansion, I think.  It's kind of fun owning a business and selling stuff.    If you're planning on getting all the expansions (including Nightlife), it's usually better to install them in order of release.  So I've heard anyway.
6656da6e3e7689811e1b49e0da90344faa	Zelda,  I was the team captain for a roller hockey team in CA and I'd love to help. The 'floor' is called 'Sport Court' and it's all about those little interlocking tiles that you noticed.     With regard to the lines it's the same as ice hockey. You have the faceoff circle the marks the center of the court and the four other face off circles (two per each goal) that marks other faceoff locations should 'icing' happen. There's the blue line also near each goal to indicate the 'danger zone' (that's what my guys on defense called it anyway) and the goalie crease (danger-danger zone ;) ).    I get the feeling that you may want s'more information and if that's the case, let me know and I'll back you up. Take it easy out there.

212f69c39fa5a6ab750bce7d375539f1aa	I was born and raised in tahoe... so...    1. Get there EARLY there will be a MAD tourist rush!  2. Have breakfast at ERNIE's! A nice local coffee shop located on the west side of town. It will be one of the first things you'll see when driving in from Placerville. (it'll be on your RIGHT)  3. If you keep going down that particular road... you'll hit EMERALD BAY. Go past Pope Beach and Camp Richardson... and you'll see a sign that reads "VIKINGSHOLM" that will be the best view of the bay. BUT PLEASE!!!!!! DRIVE SLOWLY! too many people have died on that road.... its beautiful... dont kill it for everyone.  4. Lunch? If you head back into town for lunch head to MANDARIN GARDEN. Its on Lake Tahoe Blvd. Its been voted the BEST Chinese food for 3 years. Its a LOCAL place... with nice people who pretty much know everyone in town.  5. Here's a list of things to do after lunch.... take a walk down the shoreline by EL DORADO BEACH. or... do some shopping at the MARRIOTT... you can watch a movie there too.. have a cup of ice cream... or ride the gondola if you want to see the WHOLE lake.  6. DINNER!!!! For a 5 star dinner head to the casinos! Harrah's has the best! "Friday's Station" is the name of it... it serves classic filet mignon and lobster... blackened shrimp.. and plenty of other fine dining faves. If you dont want to spend a lot... head to the Forest Buffet (Harrahs), American River Cafe (Harrah;s) Pacifica Buffet (Harveys), The Carriage House (Harveys) Four Seasons Restaurant (Horizon), or LeGrande Buffet (Horizon)  7. NIGHT LIFE! Just hang out around that block!!!! theres PLENTY going on in each casino...live bands... poker... shows... arcades if u have kids... bars... whatever floats ur boat that night!      ****PLEASE REMEMBER ONE THING****    Respect the locals. The locals are the people serving you. Almost everyone who is an employee lives in tahoe and has to serve tourists all day. Be nice... use the CROSSWALK, DONT SPEED, USE YOUR BLINKER, WATCH YOUR KIDS, DONT TRASH THE TOWN, and just be courteous.

There is, once you have released them, a Boo in almost every room of the house--excepting hall ways and the like.  Sometimes a Boo will not appear until you have captured all the other ghosts in the room first.    Try gamefaqs.com for a walkthrough for Luigi's Mansion or gamewinners.com for tips.  You can also email me.  Good luck!|`|9743abff27060f7949b03ecd5cbe3a68aa	Wants you clear a room of regular ghost, the light go on!

AA12266868	Tried it. Fun for a while, but got way too repetitive and stopped playing.|`|1d57706e9b0993f821d5f22de1d01e1caa	Honestly, i played it for about 3 months. One of the things that caught my eye was that it was a free MMoRPG and it was sidescrolling. I'm not a big fan of the cash shop (paying real cash for items) because most of the items are just for appearance/cosmetic reasons and very little has to do with in game effects.    The grahpicks look ok, more like a Playstation Jr. I'm not a huge fan of most of the songs in the game, granted that the music is ok, the lack of variation will have you using winamp, or your iPod for the soundtrack.     The quests, like the game itslef seems to have no solid purpose but to kill and level up. The quests get so repeative and all you are doing is just killing X creatures, gathering Y items and it does lose its fun after a while. There's this quest and it has six parts to it..first part "collect 100 curse dolls", you do it and collect your reward. Parts 2-6 are 200,400,600,1000    So, i would say play it if you are interested, but dont expect it to be a long-lasting favorite.|`|f831217320acdccc37ac8f291268c039aa	It is fun, nice and interesting.

AA12266868	It looks fresh and different. That means the people who appreciate originality in a game will love it, but it will go mostly overlooked by the North American gaming populace. I'd play it.
AA12266868	Is this it?|`|c3831b6e0edd91b3494436e817678daaaa	check the google message boards or the yahoo message boards

If you want to download games like family feud or something like that, the trail version is free but for the whole game you will have to pay for it, probably around 20 dollars or so. You can find a big selection of free games under "yahoo games". They have like pool, hearts, spades, chess, checkers, etc. Have fun.|`|4fcf3e18c5ab4d92b2120aa68af3e35baa	Not really you just have to be sign in to yahoo and that all you don't have to pay for the game only if you downloaded

You can use any fabric you want for the lining, but cotton is best and make sure you wash it first.    1-Cut the legs off and sew them up from the inside. The seam should be along the same line as the crotch.    2- Flatten and measure the distance across at the top. (should be 1/2 the waist measurement) Measure the distance from the top of the waistband to the seam you made in step 1 Add 1/2 inch. Cut 2 squares of lining fabric using these measurements. Sew the sides of the squares together (right sides together) at the sides and bottom.    3-Make a strap from the length of the leg of the jeans. Decide how wide you want the strap and double that width. Cut a strip that wide from the jeans. Fold the edges to the wrong side and press, fold the strip in half, sew the open edges together, press, and sew down the folded edge the same distance as the seam on the other side.    4- 2 ways to do this- If you want a flat bottom, line the side and bottom seams up and sew across the seams on the wrong side1-2 inches in to form a triangle on both sides. This will make the bottom a rectangle. If you want to, you can skip this, but I recomend doing it. Repeat with the lining fabric.    5- Pin the strap to the outside on both sides to decide how long you want the strap to be. Cut the strap 2 inches longer than you want it. If you want an adjustable strap, you will need a slide and you'll have to figure that out on your own as I don't have space here.    6- this is the tricky bit. With the denim wrong side out, pin the ends of the strap at the desired length to the wrong side of the bag. The ends will be on the outside. Put the rest of the strap on the inside (right side) of the bag. With the lining right side out, put the denim inside the lining. Pin the edges to the top edge of the denim lining up the seams on the sides at the edge of the denim but folding 1/2 inch in from the edge on the lining. Sew as close to the edge of the denim as possible. Ensure that the ends of the strap are under the lining.    7- Flip the whole lot so the denim is right side out. Push the lining into place. Press. If desired, tack the lining to the corners inside the bag. You're done!
a77b303d01d33a09d61af18816177c09aa	For dry tobacco (cigarettes, cigars, snuff, etc.):    Place the tobacco in a closed container (Tupperware like).  In the middle of the container, put a shot glass filled with the flavoring oils that you want.  (Spearmint oil, cinnamon oil, etc.)  Don't use extracts, as these contain alcohol.  You can get sampler sizes of the oils at www.lorannoils.com.    For moist tobacco (dip, chew, etc.):    Just add a drop or two of the oil directly to the tobacco (very little goes a long way).  Mix it and let it sit for a day or two.|`|AA10963254	you really shouldnt smoke its bad for yours and other people like mine heath.|`|96e194cadb337aae046febd3cfb47db3aa	i think you have you buy it...but if you are serious to make it buy plain tobacco them add flavor...

I seem to remember a game called something like "Bible Legends" on Nintendo.  Until you can relax and learn to enjoy a little blood, guts, 'n ****, video games are probably not for you.  They're made for fantasy and fun and escape from the everyday world.    You should stick to checkers, or maybe Pac-Man - that is, if you can handle the horror of a circle-man eating ghosts.  Ghosts are demonic, right?  Or "spiritism" as you put it.
