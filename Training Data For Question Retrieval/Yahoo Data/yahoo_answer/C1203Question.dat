Ok I am 14 and think I would like to be a doctor. there are 4 that really interest me.      Anesthesiologists - An anesthesiologist is the one who 'puts you out' for surgery and who monitors the patent's vitals      Emergency Medicine Doctors - If you have ever watched the television show ER, then you have a rough idea as to what emergency medicine doctors do. They work in a hospital's emergency room, responding to myriad medical conditions      Oncologists - Treating cancer is what an oncologist does. Oncologists may end up specializing in the treatment of specific cancers      Psychiatrist - Unlike psychologists, a psychiatrist is a medical doctor who has graduated from medical school and can prescribe medications. You will be working with people who suffer from a variety of mental illnesses, and could be located in a hospital's psychiatric ward or in private practice, or both.       How many years of collage for each?   What are the best collages?   If you are one of these, Do you enjoy it? Why?      I was recently asked if I knew what I wanted to be when I grow up and i honestly did not. I LOVE science and anatomy that I have studied and the things I study I can remember FOREVER!       Would this be a good career for me when I grow up?   I like to be focused on what I want and would like to actually know what I want.      Thanks! God Bless   "Bumble Bee"

Is it because this is too far away to see with the naked eye?   I've obviously misunderstood something here and would be grateful if someone could put me right.

What is the density of dihydrogen sulfide gas (H2S) on the surface of Venus, where typical conditions are 500degrees celcius at a pressure of 90.0 atm (760torr = 1atm)?      mass of H2S = 34g   i believe to get volume you must use the PV=nRT ideal gas law   V=nRT/P      the trouble im having is finding the mole in that because mole = g/molar mass but the grams is not given, how to calculate?!

Both scopes are almost identical in almost all aspects even price. To upgrade to a drive/goto systems is around $499 for both which I DO plan on doing after I spend some time learning how to use the equatorial mount manually. I plan on buying the celestron 1.25 eyepiece set when I get the scope this week. At some point I will want to get a solar filter, IR filters, 2" eye pieces, medium length exposure CCD and other various upgrades. Which would be a better choice between the two for upgrades and which would have better optics from the start?        This will be my first (big scope) and will be my only scope for at least 5-10 years. I DO know that astronomy is not learned overnight and that it will take time to learn the many aspects of this hobby. I will be willing to spend as much free time as possible to get the results I want to achieve. Please do not tell me photography is too advanced or advise me to get a large aperture dob or manual reflector that does not have upgrade potential, I want to be able to take hour long exposures when I progress to that level.

A random sample of 10 pills was measured and their diameters yield the following results:      2.95,  2.92,  2.92,  2.91,  3.00,  2.93,  2.90,  2.98,  3.05,  2.92.      Test at the 2% level of significance whether the machine still produces pills of diameter of 3mm, assuming that the distribution is approximately normal.      State the degree of freedom and one assumption required for the distribution.         Answers:      The distribution is approximately normal.                  Let   be the mean of the population           H0:  = 3   H1:    3               Level of Significance: 2%       Degree of freedom = 9             Reject H0 if |t| < 2.821 (how they know it's |t| < 2.821?)             Test statistic: t = -3.44 (why is this the t = -3.44?)                       Since t-value = -3.44<-2.821, there is sufficient evidence to reject H0 at the 2% significance level and we conclude that the machine does not produce pills of diameter of 3 mm.

This calamitous war will start from the Philippines, at Spratly Islands in particular. The Spratly Islands lie on the South China Sea mostly near the coast of the Philippines. The Holy Spirit told us that the troubles in the Philippines is like the wick of a lamp. Once the wick is lit, it will be on and aglow. He told us about this prophecy more than a decade ago. Please read what is happening in the Philippines now. Spratly Islands which is being claimed wholly or partly by six countries including China is in the news and considered a tinderbox, a flash point. It is very rich in oil and gas resources, more than the reserve of Kuwait. The high price of oil may trigger the grabbing of these islands and start the war.      Is that true? or false.

20090202142308AA3oGhM	Science & Mathematics;Astronomy & Space	How plausible is the Gaia Hypothesis?	"The Gaia hypothesis is an ecological hypothesis proposing that the biosphere and the physical components of the Earth (atmosphere, cryosphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere) are closely integrated to form a complex interacting system that maintains the climatic and biogeochemical conditions on Earth in a preferred homeostasis" -  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_hypoth...       I'm interested in what you folks think.  It would require natural selection on an enormously macro level that, to my knowledge, is unprecedented.  The biggest objectors to it come from the field of biology.  However, proponents of GH state that GH is based upon interaction from a number of different fields and that biologists have a very narrow view of things.  I'm done some of my own research into this and found that in both geography and biology there are proponents and objectors to the theory.      Please don't jump to conclusions and try to do some research before you answer, even if it's just reading the wikipedia article.  I'm curious what Yahoo Answers, a collection of intelligent people with very diverse scientific backgrounds, think of GH.      An example of GH being plausible is that the Earth self regulates its temperature when they reaches extremes.  When the oceans freeze over, no CO2 is absorbed by the oceans and the planet heats up via the greenhouse effect.  When the Earth is covered mostly in water, too much CO2 is absorbed by the oceans and the Earth cools.  In this way the Earth maintains a form of homeostasis.         Please star this if you find it interesting.  I'd like to get as many views from the most possible angles as possible.

I think the problem can be written as:      ?(?·A) = ?[?xAx + ?yAy + ?zAz]      = ?^2xAx + ?y?xAx + ?z?xAx + ?x?yAy + ?^2yAy + ?z?yAy + ?x?zAz + ?y?zAz + ?^2zAz      At this point, is it just a case of doing partial differentiation for every term? I just wasn't sure because wouldn't that mean having to do the quotient rule for partial differentiation 9 times since there are 9 terms? I wish there was a simpler way to do it if that's the case.       The solution to this is suppose to be:      -2 (r/r^3)

Observation: In the wild, prairie deer mice, Peromyscus maniculatus bairdi, are abundant in open grassy fields and scarce in adjacent forested areas.      This observation leads to the obvious question: Why are prairie deer mice more abundant in grassy fields than in forest?      Below, we propose two different hypotheses, one proximate, and one ultimate. Your job is to propose an alternative to each of these hypotheses (i.e., another hypothesis that is a potentially mutually exclusive alternative to the one we provide), and then to make one prediction that would be true for each of the hypotheses (i.e., a total of 4 predictions, one for each of the hypotheses we propose, and one for each of the alternative hypotheses that you propose).      Hypothesis 1 (our proximate hypothesis): Prairie deermice develop their preference for the grassland habitat over forested habitat through an imprinting-like process.      Hypothesis 1A (your alternate hypothesis to Hypothesis 1): ?      Hypothesis 2 (our ultimate hypothesis): Prairie deermice choose the grassland habitat over forested habitat because their food supply is more abundant in grassland.      Hypothesis 2A (your alternative to hypothesis 2): ?       Predictions are numbered as for the hypotheses (i.e., Prediction 1 goes with Hypothesis 1, Prediction 1A goes with Hypothesis 1A, Prediction 2 goes with Hypothesis 2, and Prediction 2A goes with Hypothesis   2A)      Prediction 1?

20090202213002AAjaHiT	Science & Mathematics;Earth Sciences & Geology	Where in the world can I find silicon?	I can't possibly found any source that tells me WHERE silicon is found. I see where it is USED in : technology, agate, etc. And sources keep telling me that the pure form of silicon can not be found in nature or other sources tell me that it is rare to find silicon in the purest form. I want to know where it's found in the world, but instead I get things like: how it's found in the earth's crust and how it's so abundant. Well, Wiki doesn't help at all and I've read through it without answering my question. Help? I want to know what countries or regions or areas in this world silicon is found a lot in. Multiple answers are great. Thanks! [ And don't say Silicon Valley, California please ;) ]

20090202213301AAIVCYo	Science & Mathematics;Physics	Physics problem (velocity) ? ?	A car comes to a bridge during a storm and finds the bridge washed out. The driver must get to the other side, so he decides to try leaping it with his car. The side the car is on is 22.8  above the river, while the opposite side is a mere 1.3  above the river. The river itself is a raging torrent 51.0  wide.      1. How fast should the car be traveling just as it leaves the cliff in order just to clear the river and land safely on the opposite side?      2. What is the speed of the car just before it lands safely on the other side?      I've been thinking on this problem for like 3 hrs and I still can't figure it out. Help will be appreciated.
