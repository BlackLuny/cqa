I'm not sure if I should get the KWA KM4 or the G&G GR16 Carbine because I feel 400fps is a little high for what I play (mostly street and relatively close woods) and I don't want to downgrade for a field.  Some airsoft websites have told me that the G&G actually has a slightly higher ROF than the KWA while both using 9.6v nunchuck batteries.  Please help me decide by providing some information or if you feel like there is a better gun to choose say it.

20090131151202AAAso4t	Sports;Hockey	What is the role of veterans in developing can't miss prospects?	A comment LITY made last night on a Datsyuk vs Ovechkin question has me thinking about the role veteran stars play in the development of can't miss prospects.      Does having a aging star on the team like an Yzerman or a Sakic speed a players development as a all round player.  Historically dynasties like the Habs from the 50's to the 70's always had the benefit of veterans who knew how to win to pass on that knowledge to the next generation.  Today most number one overall picks end up on a weak team with no winning history or recent expansion.  Many have had trouble adjusting.      Guys like Lecavalier took a long time to develop.   Guys like Crosby had the benefit of a Lemieux Roberts and Recchi   Staal had brindamour   Daigle had no-one, could he have reached his potential or something closer to it had he been on a team with players who knew how to win?      To summarize, these highly touted prospects have trouble adjusting often, is it a result of not paying their dues in the minors or not have star teammates who have been there and done that before?

We have the option of keeping 13 players at no extra charge this year. Next year, we will sign players to 1-3 year contracts at $5 + original salary per year. I have a dilemma this year in who I should keep and I need some help. I have both Hanley Ramirez ($43) and David Wright ($42). I am definitely keeping Hanley. Should I consider keeping Wright as well? This seemed like a no brainer a few months ago, but after thinking about it, I don’t think I can afford to tie up 1/3 of my total salary in 2 players. We also have 3 utility spots and a lot of bench room. My keepers include the following. I will not be keeping all of them.       Hanley Ramierez $43   Joakim Soria $2   Jay Bruce of 5    Joey Votto 1b 1    Cole Hamels sp 19    Brandon Webb sp 21    Brian Fuentes rp 5    Bobby Abreu of 9    James Sheilds sp 8    Yunel Escobar ss 1    Lastings Milledge of 1    Kosuke Fukudome of 1    Casey Blake 3b 1    David Wright 3b 42    Adam Dunn of 14       What do you think I should do?

20090131171336AAoGCt6	Sports;Football (American)	Why do you think that NFL FOOTBALL is the least effected by what teams play in the championships?	NBA gets a boost because LA Lakers play Boston Celtics, but if some small market team plays again ratings go in the dumps.       World Series needs teams like Red Sox, Yankees or Cubs to give the series a boost or they go into a nose dive. Witness all time low rated 2008 Series the fans in Philly tuned in , but only something like 40% TV's in Tampa did and for the rest of the country it could have been on the moon for all anybody cared.        NHL needed an original 8 team like Red Wings and haven" Sid the Kid" or its back to the ratings lower then a tractor pull contest.       Even NCAA BCS Bowls and NCAA FINAL 4 are dependent on certain big name schools. Witness this years  Orange Bowl one of the teams was the Cincinnati Bear Cats and not only does it get record low TV ratings, but they couldn't give those tickets away. Love or hate them , but Notre Dame gives college bowl games an over 50% boost in the TV ratings.

Do you like it better when a superstar get eliminated from a battle royal better if they go flying over the top rope or do you  like it when (like maria) and crash into the ropes,land on the apron and then fall off.   Personally I like the way maria does it, it may not be as cool but it is more realistic, who is gonna have the strength to throw some one that hard so that they fly over the top rope?

20090131165002AA95YR9	Sports;Basketball	Which 4 teams will be the #1 seed in the March Madness tournament and why?	My picks:    Marquette- they have been playing very good basketball and has been undefeated in the Big East. In my opinion that's enough to make me pick them.   Connecticut- they have been improving as the season goes by. They don't have anybody that scores over 20 points, but they do have 6 players that average around 10 points which makes everyone a threat on the floor.   Duke- A very good fundamental team. They come ready to every game and no one on this team is an individual. You can be guaranteed that they will have the upper hand as they are always prepared for what they face.   Oklahoma- The fact that I would pick UNC, but Duke will beat them to send them to a #2 seed. Oklahoma is a very good team. Blake Griffin is a great player, but he has a starting lineup that is very talented as well. This team is solid and they will receive the #1 seed.

Once again he had a strong showing w/ 23 points and 17 rebounds against Indiana. Making it a NBA leading 36 double doubles slightly ahead of DH12.      What is incredible is he managed to do this against Jeff Foster - who has led the NBA in Rebounds per 48 minutes for years now. Not, to mention he is one of if not the best defenders in the Center position and David Lee made him look, like a rookie.      D.Lee has embarrassed both Amar'e and Shaq this year, West, Yao, Jamison, KG, etc. He is also 4th in the NBA in FG% and RPG%. Making it the 3rd consecutive year he is top 5 in these categories. The 1st of which, he has done in the starting lineup.

20090131193635AA5nT94	Sports;Basketball	Bynum injures knee    ?	Why are people rejoicing and saying crap about Pierce I think that if a player is hurt then feel sorry for them. You want to beat the Lakers when they aren't at full strengh. If you are a true die hard NBA fan then you don't want any player to get hurt. I for one wouldn't be rejoicing if KG got hurt I would feel sorry and hope for a quick recovery. Lakers fans should be ashamed that they are making crap about PP he was injured but instead of lying in the locker room feeling sorry he came back and adrenaline kicked over and when Bynum is injured Celtics fans should not rejoice because if you see how Desmond Mason had season ending surgery I didn't see any one making crap about that because people think ow well the OKC are nothing and what about Alonzo Mourning we didn't talk crap when he had a kidney transplant no we were praying that he got better fast at least ever decent NBA fan and we should for Bynum as well and to those who think that when we can take a stab at the Laker or Celtics or Cavs we do that's just plain crap when we should be hoping for the best for Bynum we are making jokes and some celtic fans I have seen are already saying the injury is Shaun Livingston like then you are plain sick in the head.  No one should have to suffer the fate that Livingston did and god bless him for coming back.  We should pray for Bynum to get better      Star is you think this makes sense

20090131203027AAwNHxT	Sports;Football (Soccer);Other - Soccer	Please, help with soccer cleat sizing!?	I'm getting new soccer cleats, but I'm not sure what size to get them in(I'm ordering them online).I have size 11, leather cleats that I wore for the whole last season, and they felt fine then, but now, when I tried them on, I can't move my toes very well and they are very tight, somewhat uncomfortable. I heard I should get cleats a half size small or so, but now I'm thinking of getting my new cleats(full-grain leather, not kangaroo) in size11.5 because I'm going to wear these from now through next season in the fall and I'm afraid my feet may grow a little more. I'm only about 5'8'' and probably still growing, I'm also getting them bigger because of how my current cleats feel. Is this a good idea or should I get 11's again.
