What is the average cannon bone circumference for various breeds? Shetlands, Fjords, Quarter, Arab & drafts?   I am trying to figure out the carrying weight for each of our program horses. I have done the other formulas on line and it works for some and not the others. I am creating my own version using horses body condition score and age as factors. But I want to use the cannon bone idea too. We have Fjords, Arabs and Quarter horses but I wouldn't put the same amount on them. I just want an average to see if my idea will work.

20090128153110AAb9u4l	Science & Mathematics;Mathematics	Calculus rates question?	Hi,      I think I know how to answer this question, but a little bit of reassurance from a reliable math guru would be nice.      The question is:      The population of a country, measured in millions is given by P=1.05(1.018)^t, where t is the number of years since the start of 1990.  According to this model, how fast is the population growing at the start of 1990 and at the start of 1995? Give units.      My understanding is, that i should differentiate the equation implicitly and take the natural log of both sides to start.      Then to solve from the start of 1990, t=0   Then to solve from the start of 1995, t=5   ......and plug those values into the differentiated equation      Does this make sense? or am I doing this all wrong?      Units should be in millions of people per year, correct?      Thank you in advance!

20090128153045AAAsXzB	Science & Mathematics;Biology	What happens to an Amoeba when you remove the nucleus?	One of the first experiments ever performed concerning the nucleus involved removing one from an amoeba. Scientists discovered that when the nucleus was removed by microsurgery, the amoeba died within a few days. However, when a nucleus from a different amoeba was implanted within 24 hours after removing the original one, the cell continued carrying out its normal functions and survived.      How is this possible??   Also what process would be interrupted  when the nucleus is removed and what effects would this have on the cell??

I am a registered organ donor, but I also have a contract to sign to donate my body for medical research after I die.  I originally thought they could use whatever organs they needed and then donate the rest to a medical school.  I learned, however, that they won't accept bodies that have donated organs.        I should add that I have several medications I have to take every day, so I'm not so sure if they could use my organs anyway, since the meds would be in my system and I don't know about long-term effects on my liver and kidneys.  I also have multiple kidney stones on both sides, and have for several years...and unfortunately I'm a smoker who just can't kick the habit.        I want to do something beneficial for others with the shell I leave behind someday, but I'm not so sure which way to go with this decision.  Any and all helpful advice would be appreciated.

20090128160405AA0UQ5p	Science & Mathematics;Biology	I have a question about pigments...?	Okay, so I know that plant cells have choroplasts.  I also know that in the chloroplasts, there are granas.  The granas are made of thylakoids, and on the thylakoid membrane, there are pigments (chlorophyll), which give the plant it's color.  I know that animal cells do not have chloroplasts, therefore don't have thylakoids or chlorophyll.  But I know people and animals have pigments.  Where are the pigments?  Are they floating between the cells or are they on an organelle?

20090128160817AAPecjC	Science & Mathematics;Engineering	How do I transfer from college (Mech. Technology) to University (Mech. Engineering) in Canada? ?	MY SITUATION:   I am currently in my second year of a 3-year Mechanical Technology program at a college in Ontario. I have excellent grades in college (straight A's and A+'s) and my objective is to transfer to University for Mechanical Engineering.   I had graduated from high school previously, however I did not take any of the pre-requisites that are now required for admissions to Engineering in university (i.e. calculus, physics, chemistry, etc.).   I am now taking similar classes in college (with the exception of chemistry). I am considering taking this chemistry from the Independent Learning Centre (ilc.org) if it will help me get accepted into University.   I have researched extensively online, talked to my program co-ordinator, visited Ryersonâs admissions office, but I have yet to receive a set answer to my questions.   I have already applied to the University program (to enrol in 2009 Fall) but I need to know if I can do anything to increase my chances of getting in.      MY QUESTION:   1) Whether the classes that I am taking in college are considered to be equivalent to the pre-requisites needed for admissions into Mech. Engineering      2) Are ILC courses REALLY considered by Universities to be equivalent to the corresponding high school course?       3) Anybody know of school contacts that may be able to help me out      Any personal experience or information from someone working at a University would be greatly appreciated.       Thanks in advance....!

I wanted to see what people thought about this. In my class a ton of people were like " OH MY GOD! THE END OF THE WORLD! AHH WERE ALL GOING TO DIE!" I did NOT believe this.... Heres the  question..      Do YOU the people who are reading this, this the world WILL end in 2012?      I dont because it would have been in the bible. The bible DOES NOT talk about an Ice Age killing off the human race. In revelations, it says we wont know when it come. It will just show up.. like no one wil be expecting thiss..Since everyones expecting it its NOt gonna hapen right?

20090128164953AA6yjDY	Science & Mathematics;Geography	Something that has nothing to do with geography?	My geography teacher says that anyone who comes to him with the right answer will get an automatic A+ for the semester. His question was this: âTry to name something that has absolutely nothing to do with geography?â About a fifty items were blurted-out but also shoot down faster than you can say âcat in the hatâ. So Iâm like really curious about what it could be and an A+ in the class would defiantly be a plus. Being a Christian I immediately thought of God because he is everywhere even if you donât believe in him he is near so he couldnât shoot it down by saying heâs part of culture/ religion. So I donât know thatâs my guess and I havenât asked if its right yet but I will next class. So yeah any ideas or hints would be awesome. Iâm a pretty smart kid so Iâm not looking to collect that A+ as much as I am trying to be that kid that only gets it once every four years.

20090128170200AA4htmn	Science & Mathematics;Biology	Question about evolution and passing on genes to children ?	To survive an animal evolves to require "desirable traits" depending on where it lives. These "desirable traits" are passed on to offspring so they too may survive in certain conditions as well. This being said, how come I  cannot pass on muscles to my children if I weight train? When I weight train I tear my muscles up, the result being if I rest my muscles will not only heal them selves but will evolve so they will be harder to tear up (hence bigger and stronger muscles). Since adults pass on desirable traits to offspring why can't my children have muscles because I do? (with weight training of course) I know evolution does not happen in the immediately, but given that my later generations weight trained why wouldn't their future generations have muscles? I know this does not happen so I am curious. Thank you and sorry for the long question.

I also know that      Energy released by the reaction = specific heat capacity â mass of solution â increase in temperature      So,      Energy released = specific heat capacity â 250 g â ?T .      What I don't know is if I'm even using the right formula to find the heat released, and if so, what the specific heat capacity is and how to find ?T.      Thanks.

It seems to me that most of the people that are racist are racist because they believe that other races aren't as intelligent as their own, so say that scientists would find a gene (or genes) that rose peoples' IQs to the same level. They would then give each race this high IQ trait. I know that genetic inheritance of IQ is questionable for some and that some people believe that differences in IQ is 100% due to environmental differences, but hypothetically speaking say that was the case (i.e. the hypothetical scenario I gave above). Do you think it would put a stop to most racism?

But i decide to b a runner. im not very good but i try and get to the best i can. i have a kid and i belive he will have a better chance at developing running skills and muscles to be a runner since i passed on my adaption to run.  now if my kid follows my dream he mite not be better but i think he has something that if he becomes a runner or works out that he will do slightly better then me. and if he does the same that within several generations of running and trying to develop muscles then finally a child will be naturally able to develop muscles above average and run faster then avg.      No i got no proof just a theory so any thoughts on were to place this will be greatly appreciative it      also if u steal my idea go for it tell som1 i wanna see it in my newspaper within 20 years from now ''Scientists discover secret coding to passing on adaptions''      and plz dont waste my question space with ''ur gramer and spelingg suks go to skool''  or ''that's plain stupid''  and btw i was stoned off my *** when i came up with this just a lil thing to add.

Assuming that there is no heat lost to the surroundings, what should the equilibrium temperature be? [The answer is 32Â°C]      2) Consider the sublimation of CO2 (dry ice). What is the sign on w? on q? [Answer: w is - (expansion of gas) and q is + (heat required)].      3) Use the standard heats of formation to determine the enthalpy change associated with the following reaction:       2 C2H6 (gas) + 5 O2 (gas) --> 4 CO2 (gas) + 6 H2O (liquid).      For #3, I know how to find the heat of formation; my question is, how does one find it without having a chart of ?HÂ° (kJ/mol) values of each compound?
