Whereas Air implies that you communicate well and are very social.<br>  So I suppose you show elements of both, they do overlap and come hand in hand with each other. The 2 signs are compatible with one another!

The air is about moving, flowing and communicating. These two elements can have a restlessness, so you need variety and an outlet for your energy.

I once heard Gary Rossington say in an interview that they wrote the song as almost a joke and they really didn't even like Alabama.

Slash knew Young throughout all of junior high, who coincidentally was a friend of Slash's first girlfriend.  According to Axl, he and Young were in a car together when "Your Song" by Elton John came on the radio and Michelle 'happened' to mention that she'd always wanted someone to write a song about her.|`|48df0ea585c1658be36a46553408d993aa	Excellent question.

I think that Slumdog Millionaire is a fine and incredible film, shot very well and with a crappy last act.<br>  <br>  2. Mickey Rourke is great in The Wrestler and his best performance of all time.<br>  <br>  However, I believe that MILK should win best film and Sean Penn should win Best Actor. It will not and Penn wont but if people voted on talent rather than what they've been through in the past then Penn would win. His performance was the best I've seen this year and if it was Daniel Day Lewis then people would be gushing all over him. Pardon the expression.<br>  <br>  Best Fim: Slumdog Millionaire (Will be), Milk (Should be)<br>  Best Actress: Kate Winslett (Will be and should be)<br>  Best Actor: Mickey Rourke (Will be), Sean Penn (Should be)<br>  Best Supp Actress: Penelope Cruz (Will be), Marisa Tomei (Should be)<br>  Best Supp Actor: Heath Ledger (Will be and should be)<br>  Best Director: Danny Boyle (Will be and should be)

But not Katy. She is terrible live and they make her voice sound so much better in the studios. Gabriella is pretty good tho, if u ever heard her, she has a powerful voice for being 17,18. Idk, I dont think Katy is that great.

I think that what will make the difference.

fMfBAgOUaa	Yes, take a music theory class. If you dont know your theory, you wont be able to write songs for ****. Trust me, before I took it, I could come up with simple riffs and stuff... but writing a whole song was so tedious and time consuming... and hardly ever sounded good, because I didnt know what I needed to. After taking a theory class last semester, I can sit down and write down any kind of song I like, and make it sound good easily. It helps when writing solos... riffs... whole songs... anything musical. Without knowing your theory, you will end up playing the same things over and over again, because you dont know how to expand.|`|bwKZ8MWWaa	THe theory will spoil it for you.  Buy Mel Bays guitar chords book|`|IjwOIRcmaa	My friend and I are both taking music theory in high school. I play classical music and a little jazz, but he is a mad good guitarist you likes to make up his own songs too. He's always relating his guitar techniques to the material he learns in class, so I think it helps him. I know that it helps me a lot when I'm trying to write music or understand a jazz solo. It really teaches you the elements that make a song flow and sound good. We talk about all types of chords, cadences, melody, harmony, contrast, transposition, and rhythm. My teacher sometimes speaks specifically about guitar technics like the impact of different pedal, why to avoid power cords, and a lot of other stuff that goes over my head. So, basically, yeah I think you should take it. At my school most the people you continue to take AP music theory are almost all guitarists or drummers.

q8yOILG6aa	Chris Brown and Rihanna were riding in his rented silver Lamborghini when he received a text message. Rihanna got jealous, snatched the phone and started flipping out. She started hitting him (not sure where but he DEFINITELY has marks) and shouting. Chris Brown couldn't drive under these conditions so he stopped the car.<br>  <br>  At this point, Rihanna threw the keys out of the ignition and this set Chris off but he did not hit her... YET. When he couldn't find the keys, he returned to the car and yelled at her for throwing them. Rihanna put her hands over Chris Brown's mouth and thats how Rihanna got the bite marks.<br>  <br>  Rihanna then said something that REALLY set Chris Brown off. According to reliable sources, Rihanna said something to the affect of "What are you going to do, beat me up like your step-dad did to you and your mother?"<br>  <br>  This really set Chris off as his family past is a very sensitive subject. Chris went into a fit of rage and hit Rihanna a few times.<br>  <br>  In short, Rihanna instigated the fight and Chris Brown took it WAY too far.

h6JJNgoKaa	The short answer is yes youshould take one of them.  I suggest the grade 9 as it is closer to the grade 10 than the grade 8.   You also need most of the technique from the grade 9 for the grade 10.  Is it not really mandatory.  But.....    To pass grade 10 the technical and the amount of music greatly increases and the passing mark goes from 60% to 70%.|`|t3PJJiLbaa	I don't think that you actually have to take it in the first place but Im not quite sure.<br>  Just go to www.rcmexaminations.org you can probably find out there.

Buhahaha.<br>  <br>  Picture of her when she was beat up: <a href="http://www.oceanup.com/rihanna/" rel="nofollow">http://www.oceanup.com/rihanna/</a><br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT HAPPENED: At the request of the Los Angeles District Attorney's Office, Chris Brown is being investigated for felonies, including domestic violence, assault resulting in great bodily injury and based on specific allegations made by Rihanna, even attempted murder, a source told E! News. <br>  <br>  Prosecutors fear that proving any serious felony charges would be difficult in a case where there are no direct witnesses other than Rihanna and Brown. Brown is accused of beating Rihanna the morning of Feb. 8, causing them both to cancel their scheduled Grammy performances that night. <br>  <br>  Rihanna told police that, while the two were fighting in his rented Lamborghini, Brown said to her, 'I'm going to kill you,' while his hands were around her neck. The Barbados-born songstress, who is reportedly cooperating with the cops' investigation, also told authorities that Brown choked her until she lost consciousness.. <br>  <br>  Brown was booked by police on suspicion of making criminal threats, but the DA's office wanted further investigation into the incident before it decided on pressing charges. Chris is currently back home with his family in Virginia. <br>  <br>  Rihanna was treated after the incident at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and was discharged the following night. She spent last week with her family in Babardos before departing for parts unknown. <br>  <br>  <br>  WHAT HER PARENTS SAID:<br>  Rihanna's father, Ronald Fenty, talked to People about when he first heard that his daughter had been attacked by Chris Brown, 'I didn't believe it. I know my daughter. You think you know somebody, but you really don't.'<br>  <br>  On Ri's current condition: 'There is some bruising. She will be alright. I think so. At some point, she will speak out. I hope she will stand up for women all over the world.. They seemed pretty happy. I don't know what went wrong.' <br>  <br>  Chris Brown's biological father, Clinton Brown, told People: 'Chris is reflecting on this situation. He's very remorseful. He's very concerned about the situation and he wants to make sure that [Rihanna's] okay. This is unfortunate, this stumble, this situation. Hopefully, he will get past it. We all have our shortcomings. <br>  <br>  We all trip. There are two sides to every story. If you are on his side, you are on his side. Just because someone trips, if you are truly a fan, you are not going to demonize him instantaneously.'<br>  <br>  Brown worries about the public backlash: 'This music industry is very unforgiving when it comes to having indiscretions. He will continue to be a good person. He loves people. And like most of us, most humans, things will occur. <br>  <br>  Hopefully a person won't be judged simply on that alone. As a father, I couldn't be more proud.. He's the light of my life. I think he's going to grow as an individual. He's going to take from this situation and learn from it.' <br>  <br>  MORE INFO:Rihanna told law enforcement that Chris Brown has attacked her before. According to TMZ, the Los Angeles County District Attorney has ordered police to further investigation because evidence against Chris is still lacking. However, he will almost certainly be charged with felony domestic battery. <br>  <br>  According to the police report, here is what happened that fateful night: After Chris received a text message from a woman who wrote about getting together, an argument erupted. By the way, initially, Rihanna would not tell cops what started the argument. <br>  <br>  She did, however, tell them that during the argument, he started hitting her. She ordered him to drive her home and 'faked a call' to someone, saying things like, 'He's dropping me off. Make sure the cops are there.' Rihanna told cops the fake call enraged Brown. He said something to the effect of 'You are really fu**ed up now. I'm going to kill you.' <br>  <br>  This statement is the basis of the criminal threats charge. At that point, Brown allegedly began a violent attack with his fists. At some point, Rihanna took the keys out of the ignition and threw them outside. According to the police report, she told cops this was not the first time Brown hit her.. <br>  <br>  WHY HE HIT HER: Rihanna's beating by Chris Brown started with a text message, reports NYDN. The fight that landed Rihanna in the hospital ignited when singer Chris Brown got a text message from another woman. The source said: <br>  <br>  'He got a booty call. He got a text. Rihanna saw it and she got upset. They started to argue. She got out of the car. He wanted her to get back in, so he grabbed her. She pulled away. That's when she's told people he hit her.' <br>  <br>  Rihanna had 'visible injuries' when cops arrived. She's been cooperating with the investigation ever since, while not speaking with Brown. 'Chris has been trying to contact her. So far she hasn't taken his call. Her family is on their <br>  way to be with her.

Not much , if anything, is known about him....except that he died and left Bessie a widow.  Her second husband was Jack Gee. They had a very tumultuous relationship.....due in large part to her many affairs ( a large number being with other women) and they often wound up beating each other bloody.|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Everything you need to know about Bessie Smith's recording career and a lot of her personal life.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&searchlink=BESSIE|SMITH&sql=11:kifwxq95ldae~T1" rel="nofollow">http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg...</a>|`|TUiT6uhpaa	You cannot trust Wikipedia!|`|geq6iU0Oaa	Never trust Wikipedia as a reliable source.

It's very suspensful and spooky.<br>  <br>  Also, from what i hear, the movie "The Orphanage" is supposed to be right up the alley of "The Sixth Sense", or "The Others".  Very creepy and disturbing.  This movie is in Spanish, and i haven't seen the version online with the subtitles yet, but i hope to someday.

It's starting to rain and the top is down."|`|k6flESfNaa	im a Blonde too :)<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  what do you call a smart Blonde?<br>  a golden retriever!!!<br>  lol Golden's are my breed!<br>  <br>  <br>  OK how about a nasty one?<br>  <br>  <br>  a Blonde, brunette, and a red head were driving in the country when the car broke down, it was night so they had to wait for a mechanic until morning. so they spent the night at a widows house who only lived with her son.<br>  <br>  when the girls saw the son they were extremely attracted to him. the widow saw what they were thinking and she told them, im going to put glitter on his wiener, and check you girls in the morning.<br>  <br>  so after the widow went to bed, the brunette sneaked in his room. they were having sex, and the widow woke up, what was that?! she yelled, and the girl went MOO MOO. oh, it was just the cow, and she went back to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  next the red head sneaked in, and again the widow woke up. what was that?! and the girl went woof woof. oh, it was just the dog. and went back to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  finally the Blonde went in his room. then widow woke up again, and yelled what was that?! the girl went MEOW MEOW, oh just the cat. and went back to sleep.<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  the next morning, the widow checked the brunette, she found glitter, you know where and shot her.<br>  <br>  next she checked the redhead and the same happened, she got shot.<br>  <br>  <br>  then she checked the Blonde and found nothing. all right sweetie, you can go she said. and she walked away, but she turned, and when she smiled, she had glitter all over her mouth!|`|ufU0VNLUaa	Ha ha that's so funny!<br>  <br>  My fave blonde jokes are:<br>  <br>  1. A blonde called me to get my phone number.<br>  <br>  2. The assistant asked the blonde if she would like her pizza cut into six pieces or twelve. <br>  <br>  "Six please" she said, "I could never eat twelve!"<br>  <br>  3. A blonde was walking down the road with a healthy looking pig under her arm. As she passed the bus stop, someone asked, <br>  <br>  "Where did you get that?"<br>  The pig replied, <br>  "I won her in a raffle!"<br>  <br>  <br>  4.  A person went into the office kitchen one morning and found a new blonde girl painting the walls. She was wearing a new fur coat and a nice denim jacket.<br>  <br>  Thinking this was a little strange, he asked her why she was wearing them rather than old clothes or an overall.<br>  <br>  She showed him the instructions on the tin, <br>  <br>  "For best results, put on two coats".<br>  <br>  <br>  5. Two blondes were in a parking lot trying to unlock the door of their car with a coat hanger.<br>  First Blonde: <br>  <br>  "I can't seem to get this door unlocked!<br>  Second Blonde: <br>  Well you better hurry up. It's starting to rain and the top is down!<br>  <br>  6. Three blondes were walking through a field when they came across a set of tracks.<br>  <br>  <br>  The first blonde looked down at the tracks and said, <br>  <br>  "I think they could be bird tracks."<br>  <br>  The second blonde went to look and said, <br>  <br>  "No, I think these are deer tracks."<br>  <br>  They stepped aside and the third blonde went over to the tracks. She looked down, then got run over by the train!<br>  <br>  7. A blonde asked someone what time it was, and they told her it was 4:45. The blonde, with a puzzled look on her face replied,<br>  <br>  <br>  "You know, it's the weirdest thing, I have been asking that question all day, and each time I get a different answer."<br>  <br>  <br>  8. A blonde was driving down the road listening to the radio and was quite upset when she heard blonde joke after blonde joke. A little way down the road, she saw another blonde out in a field rowing a boat. The blonde stopped her car and angrily jumped out yelling, <br>  <br>  "You dumb blonde bimbo! It's blondes like you that give the rest of us a bad name! If I could swim I'd come out there and give you what's coming to you!"<br>  <br>  <br>  9.  A blonde and a redhead went to the bar after work for a drink, and sat on stools watching the 6 O'clock news. A man was shown threatening to jump from the Brooklyn Bridge, and the blonde bet the redhead $50 that he wouldn't jump.<br>  <br>  Sure enough, he jumped, so the blonde gave the redhead $50. The redhead said, <br>  <br>  "I can't take this, you're my friend."<br>  But the blonde insisted saying, <br>  "No. A bet's a bet."<br>  <br>  Then the redhead said <br>  <br>  "Listen, I have to tell you that I saw this on the 5 O'clock news, so I can't take your money."<br>  <br>  The blonde replied <br>  <br>  "Well, so did I, but I didn't think he would jump again!"<br>  <br>  <br>  10. A dumb blonde was really tired of being made fun of, so she decided to have her hair she would look like a brunette.<br>  <br>  When she had brown hair, she decided to take a drive in the country.<br>  <br>  After she had been driving for a while, she saw a farmer and a flock of sheep and thought, <br>  <br>  "Oh! Those sheep are so adorable!"<br>  She got out and walked over to the farmer and said, <br>  "If I can guess how many sheep you have, can I take one home?"<br>  The farmer, being a bit of a gambler himself, said she could have a try.<br>  <br>  The blonde looked at the flock and guessed, "157."<br>  <br>  The farmer was amazed - she was right! So the blonde, (who looked like a brunette), picked one out and got back into her car.<br>  <br>  Before she left, farmer walked up to her and said. <br>  <br>  "If I can guess the real color of your hair, can I have my dog back?"|`|dYhlebH8aa	theres a blonde on a bus that needed 2 fart badly, nd since the music was so loud she decided 2 jst do it....wen she got off, she saw the cord from her headphone trailing up to her ears. she realized she was listening 2 her ipod! lol
VeEHSVT2aa	In order to shoot the opening sequence of Vanilla Sky (which was not digitially created), the production was given permission to close Times Square in the late night/early morning hours one Sunday. The only digital modification of the scene was changing the NASDAQ news ticker to avoid dating the film through the coverage of the presidential election.

Therefore i choose to believe chicken comes 1st|`|w7G3PVIuaa	Depends, are you a biblical person or an evolutionist?|`|u1nDWC3baa	Neither, it was the cheese.|`|0zrRBNXGaa	who cares|`|3d00787d933d8c4ed9121b3ad8bd5662aa	Obviously the chicken. Without a chicken to incubate the egg and care for a baby chick, how would the chicken species exist today? Excepting evolution, which I do not believe you factored in your question.|`|m64UXsSgaa	Defiantly the egg, chickens were not around when dinosaurs were laying eggs.|`|IgEYfBPJaa	the egg, then it hatched into a chicken which made another egg. :)|`|rXcfimJ4aa	the chicken came first in this question.|`|MfDRFP7faa	the egg!

N5nbOkvGaa	It's not hard. <br>  I've never had lessons but I've won two contests and a talent show for my voice. Just open your mouth, take a breath, and let your voice say what your eyes sometimes can't. Pour your heart out. And punch your dad in the nose and tell him that it's from me.|`|d5dKlgEPaa	Of course there is. A friend of mine gives singing lessons. Alot of people have beautiful voices, they just don't know how to access them. singing lessons shows you techniques to sing the right way, and not just belt it out.|`|aa5wzF9caa	oh ok, so im going to do this auditon for a musical in a week. i knew about it for 2 months and i got to tell you, i thought i was the worst singer ever but ive been practacing for 2 months and singing around the houseand wow i feel much more confident and my voice is strong and pretty good. so what im saying is that you got to use it in order to have it. sure a teacher helps, my piano teacher gave me some pointers and helped me with my audition song but im so happy now!!|`|IOQ0zIFlaa	You're dad was right.  You have it or you don't.  But some people just don't know if they have it or not.  His answer was a little harsh and was meant in a different way, but really.  If you have never sung before and you think you have potential, go for it!  Vocal coaches can do wonders for people trying to figure their voice out.<br>  <br>  I say, if you really want to pursue singing, get a vocal coach.  Tell them your situation and they will totallyyyy help you out.  <br>  <br>  Good luck!  :)|`|tu5BHpe8aa	Well, yes there are people who teach you how to  sing but...I don't know anyone that teaches people to sing!<br>  And go for your dreams don't let anyone stop you!

Sure she will be a little disappointed because she doesn't know who her birth mom is again, but she never really had a great relationship with each other.  All they ever did was fight and she always felt like Mrs.C was always criticizing. So over all, she will be okay with not being her daughter.|`|T6osHOwqaa	Like she just lost BILLIONS!!!!!!!!!!! and her place at Chancellor and IDK like she has kissed to much A$$ when she didn't have too?<br>  <br>  I always knew she wasn't really Kay's daughter.....so where does that leave Mr...I should be CEO even though last year I was a bartender (have no education for it but deserve it anyway)...Mr Cane Ashby|`|r7sgshwKaa	I wonder about that myself.

I cant wait to see her face!!|`|AA11111233	I think she already knows that, now all she needs to do is accept that she is alive, and she will be even more shocked than ever.  The look on her face will be a Kodak moment, and she will be running out of town with her *** between legs, humiliated at how she had been treating her mother.  And she'll damn well deserve it.|`|F4ZtOfEBaa	I think it will be sad.Especially for Mrs.C
jYqAtbOuaa	Culture and music definitely go hand in hand. The culture, can effect a persons sound on music. Lyrics and sounds of instruments are all how the culture can effect music. During the 1960's and 70's some songs were about vietnam and how artists felt about that subject. Whats going on in their culture effected what type of songs were produced.|`|CUMdhfKzaa	Um.

lz8Y1ihzaa	Well they got together, and then they broke up, then she found out she was "like a defective typewriter" by skipping a period.  Then at the end of the movie, they got back together.  So yeah, they're good together.  <br>  <br>  This may be blasphemy against the movie, but i never liked Danny and Sandy together.  A new york punk gettin romantic with a goody two shoes Aussie?  I think Danny and Rizzo shoulda been good together.  In fact, the track star that Lorenzo Lamas who played the jock sandy was mildly dating near the beginning of the movie, woulda been better for her, IMHO.  Of course, that goes wayyyy against the grain, but still...That's my story and i'm stickin to it!<br>  <br>  It just shows that anyone can be with anyone, i guess.  People make strange bedfellows.

But not to buy flash cars or big houses. It's for my sons' future if I'm not here.<br>  <br>  "I don't want my kids to have the same miserable, drug-blighted, poverty-stricken childhood I did.<br>  <br>  "If cancer has taught me anything it's that big houses aren't important, being rich isn't important. It's my sons who are important, it's being alive that's important.<br>  <br>  "I worry that if I'm not here they won't have the proper school blazers, they won't have shirts that fit them and they won't eat the right food. I worry they'll forget me."<br>  <br>  Goody has amassed a fortune worth several million since she found fame on Big Brother.<br>  <br>  She initially endeared herself to the show's viewers with her ignorance of geography, amusing fellow contestants in 2002 with remarks including: "Rio de Janeiro - ain't that a person" and "I was an escape goat".<br>  <br>  After leaving the Big Brother house, Goody hosted reality TV shows and was a regular fixture in the gossip pages.<br>  <br>  She launched her own perfume, fitness DVDS and autobiographies, all of which were lapped up by her fans.<br>  <br>  But two years ago the backlash came, with Goody branded "Miss Piggy" and an "evil" racist.<br>  <br>  Appearing on Celebrity Big Brother, Goody was condemned for calling Shilpa Shetty 'Shilpa Poppadom' and making several other demeaning remarks about the glamorous Bollywood star.<br>  <br>  Thousands of people complained and Goody was forced to apologise.<br>  <br>  She began rebuilding her image by releasing a Christmas cookbook and appearing on India's version Big Brother last year.<br>  <br>  Ironically, it was while she was on the show that she received the news that she had cervical cancer.<br>  <br>  Since then, the British media has chronicled her battle with the disease, including her chemotherapy sessions, hair loss and devastated reaction to the news that her cancer was terminal.<br>  <br>  Goody says she doesn't care what other people think about her decision not to hide away and spend her final days in private.<br>  <br>  "I've lived in front of the cameras," she has said.<br>  <br>  "And maybe I'll die in front of them.<br>  <br>  "I know some people don't like what I'm doing, but at this point I really don't care what other people think."<br>  <br>  Goody's plight has drawn sympathy from across the country including Prime Minister Gordon Brown who described Goody's cancer as "tragic".<br>  <br>  Australia's own Kylie Minogue, who beat breast cancer, has also lent her support.<br>  <br>  "It's so sad. What can you say? I can relate to an extent to what Jade's going through, it is so tough," Minogue said.<br>  <br>  There has also been a reported increase in the number of British women going to have cervical smears since Goody revealed she had been diagnosed with cancer last year.<br>  <br>  While not all will agree with the way Goody will live out her final days, one thing is certain - she will never be forgotten."<br>  <br>  <br>  Before Jade Goo|`|zu68Wx1kaa	She will not film her death, the only reason she had filmed what was happening to her is that this poor girl thought she had a chance in life and nobody can voice their opinion as no one else is in the same situation, so could everyone keep their opinion too themselves for the sake of Jade's beautiful boys, her husband, Mum and extended family as well, My own Dad died of cancer and he was only 59, and it is the most tragic thing to watch, so I am sure nobody will film it to make money, I think Jade is the most brilliant Mum ever thinking of others when everyone should be thinking of her as she is in my prayers every night and so are her boys, so everyone should think before they act or have an opinion, GOD BLESS JADE X X X X X|`|uzZuwtgXaa	It is entirely up to her if she wishes to have her death filmed. The money will go to help her two sons. There is not a lot she can do for them but this. If the filming of her final moments helps just one person in their awareness of cancer screening, then I say well done to her. It is all very well people saying this and saying that, they are not in this nightmare situation knowing that you are goiung to die in the near future. It would be a very different situation for people running her down and judging her, if they were in this situation. Cancer is a terrible thing, and her bravery in the face of this disease is fantastic. Her son's in the future should be very proud of their mum, she loves them to bits.|`|FoXMTx6Baa	I think her intentions are honourable. <br>  <br>  Wanting to support your children when your gone is something every parent can understand.<br>  <br>  I think what she's trying to do is raise awareness about cervical cancer. Showing people the worst case scenario may shock girls into getting regular pap smears and avoid what she is going through.|`|iMaYLGECaa	she has said she wants her death to be filmed and it is then thats a very sick form of entertainment its basically like jeremy lusk's (motocrosser) crash that killed him being plastered all over youtube|`|44YEoue9aa	Scum like that ***** will do anything for attention.|`|Eqq9gqqaaa	What if she does'nt die? Won't she look stupid?|`|cPbrL1WGaa	who in the devil is that?|`|cppJ8fhdaa	She's in a terrible situation. Cancer runs in my family, and my cousin contracted it when she was 16 back in 2001. It was just the worst seeing her slowly, gradually grow weaker and weaker until finally she was gone. I had only seen her in passing at a few family get-together over the years, so my attachment o her wasn't that great. I do hope that Jane is able to survive, even if only for the sake of the value of a life and her two young sons. I ho[e I never get cancer, statistically that's a possibility. I guess I had better accomplish all the great things that I want to do in my life immediately, tomorrow is never guaranteed after all.|`|ZqRbdJekaa	I hope not, i do feel very sorry for her though

I'd recommend going to a music store and looking at all of the information on the back of the cases and seeing who and who isn't signed with WMG.(it should say) they've already targeted slipknot so don't even bother trying. other than that i don't know what to tell you. They've already screwed over youtube bad enough. I don't think it can get any worse.

Cs6aBBrJaa	Once I went in to have stitches removed and the lady was looking for the 6th stitch. I was a young kid and was already squirmish. It literally took her 5 minutes of painfully digging around my wound to remove the last stitch, then she grabbed her paperwork and said,"Oh! That's a Five, not a Six!". I lost my respect for the hospital that day.|`|5pB2QAPUaa	When I was 25, I had my tonsils taken out. the hospital was overcrowded, so they put me in pediatrics. The room was decorated <br>  with pictures of Bambi and Mickey Mouse!|`|6Ysh039uaa	i was in the hospital one time because they thought i had appendicitis. there was a girl in the same room as me, but they have those curtains between the beds for privacy and all. well she left the room to go get an x-ray or something and the curtain was closed but her dad was still there. and i heard him call my name but I didn't think he knew my name so i was confused so i hesitated for a minuted and answered..."yeah". then i heard him say "oh hi hun. how are you? what did your mom make for dinner" that's when i realized he was talking on his phone to his other daughter who apparently had the same name as me lol it was kinda embarassing|`|guGXFEfwaa	When i had my first baby and i shared the room with a african  american woman and she also had a baby around the same time as me and when they   would bring the babies in i kept thinking they were giving me her baby since mine was dark complected and her baby was almost white i kept saying are u sure this is my kid.  the lady next to me finally explained to me that there babies usually darken up in time|`|DapNp1Kxaa	This wasn't me, but when my grandma was in the hospital, having a hip replaced, they had her in a room with the grouchiest woman ever born. I know she was in pain and all, but so was grandma, and she wasn't nearly as grouchy. Anyway, the nurse came in, on the other side of the privacy curtain, which wasn't nearly thick enough! She was talking to the other lady, telling her that she had brought her her meds. The the nurse was called away, rather quickly. When she returned just a few minutes later, I heard her ask the lady, 'Where are those meds I left on your tray?" The lady grumped at her, "I ate 'em!", then the nurse said, "What about that little glycerin suppository?"  "I TOLD ya I ATE 'em!"  OK....I thought grandma and I were gonna split a gut.|`|SOfbIOzUaa	I have to say that there was nothing funny about me being in the hospital ever. And I have been there a number of times.
YwtXSUAdaa	I guess you could say Winds of Plague since they are kind of symphonic deathcore.<br>  <br>  Not many others are really pushing any limits...... most of the bands I like are just consistently putting out great music, but never trying anything too out of the ordinary.<br>  <br>  I'm just glad that the bands I like are making good music release after release and not gradually conforming to the mainstream hard rock sound of todays music.|`|0vm66wlcaa	Pushed the limits?<br>  Do you mean, go different than most in the genre, almost going out of the genre entirely?<br>  or<br>  Change the definition or sound of the genre?<br>  <br>  Well, I think Guthrie Govan pushed the limits in Instrumental jazz rock with his album Erotic Cakes. He used Classical influences in his music. It's some great jazz-rock guitar music though.|`|DbtS5jzEaa	Underoath on their latest release pushed Metalcore into a more Mathcore/Industrial sound..<br>  <br>  It was epic|`|WHcBV7rLaa	Well thats a bit vague. Pushing the limits of what? Also, that can be construed as either good or bad.<br>  <br>  <br>  Oh okay. Well I think Pansy Division really pushes the limits in a good way. They are a queer-core band, which doesn't really mean much other than a homosexual punk rock band. They are pop-punk band, but not in a shitty emo way, they are actual old school pop punk. They are awesome, and one of the few bands I listen to that doesn't fearfully dodge the topic of homosexuality or stay in the closet. They don't even change the pronouns in their lyrics to be ambiguous, they just say "he" because that's who they're singing about. And they are very in your face about everything they sing about, and their music is just really fun and awesome, and a lot of their songs are really comical and hilarious.<br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peFVkDWTdgM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=peFVkDWTd...</a><br>  <br>  <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-QIFdYkwyw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-QIFdYkw...</a>|`|aBqJhdufaa	Maybe the Foo Fighters.

Creepy....|`|UAWiu1hUaa	i just really like ALESANA!!! <33333|`|N5D7faYQaa	Psssshhhh no!!! UTG totally sunk on their new cd, their old stuff was a lot heavier. BMTH should of stuck to the thrash sound they had on the 2nd cd, the new cd sounds like arip off of Bury Your Dead. I do agree though that The Acacia Strain stepped it up to the limits on the new cd, it is definately a lot heavier. Same with Whitechapel, even though it could use more breakdowns, and Suffokate did as well.|`|aCRDZrE1aa	hmm i think that brokencyde is doing that.<br>  <br>  they've merged screamo and techno in a way that no one has managed to do yet. it's really created a dominant niche for them in the music world.<br>  <br>  i also admire the courage it took for them to use the lyrics that they have. they're provacative, suggestive, and quite creative.|`|5zwcnmOIaa	well, my favorite was grunge, but that died when layne staley died. alice in chains,nirvana,pearl jam, soundgarden, collective soul, smashing pumpkins, stone temple pilots have all made tremendous strides in their times|`|HysVH9qLaa	since grunge isnt really around anymore, and pearl jam still is, i guess taht pearl jam is cuz their kinda moving into like alternative/new rock|`|1M9lMarEaa	Gaslight Anthem is pushing limits... not sure whether it's rock or indie but it's pushing....<br>  <br>  Ohhh Chris Cornell tooo cept i can't stand his little **** electro project with Timbaland

DJbEN5oyaa	I love Japanese game shows!! and wish we could have them here like the way they have them in Japan.<br>  <br>  I think the reason why we don't over here is people are sue happy. <br>  Can you imagine if we had the Japanese version of Takeshi's Castle aka  Most Extreme Elimination Challenge{MXC} which is shown on Spike TV?<br>  <br>  The ABC version of the show stinks and is boring as in the original version the contestants are made fun of big time<br>  <br>  I bet you contestants would sue if they did that and that's why we don't see it done the same way here in the states. <br>  Also many Americans in my opinion cant grasp that type of humor sadly. <br>  Boy are they missing out on some fun.|`|AA11357227	We do have one import called "Hole In The Wall" on FOX.  I hear it's not doing too well and it's too bad.   It's an excellent show.<br>  <br>  There was a show last year called "I Survived A Japanese Game Show".<br>  <br>  Also, just to let you know,  there's nothing wrong with American game shows as well.

C0IWWEI3aa	Well I can't send you any Claire and West scenes, but you can find a synopsis on the episodes you missed or are looking for on wikipedia.org. Just search heroes, then at the very bottom of the page where it says production you can click on episodes and it will give you a brief synopsis of what happens on each episode.  As for the scenes I watched the seasons I missed on livecinemaonline.com most of them worked. If you have the tools to rip it then i guess that would be a good place. And of course there is always the old youtube stand by to try.  <br>  Hope that helped|`|a231cd46589d3ea6efabcc68cdd6e69baa	Claire and West were in season 2, which was only 11 episodes long.

hceNM6Uxaa	I think what I absolutely love is that for all the power of her voice, you're never quite sure if she's going to go right over some edge into disintegration - so it keeps you absolutely on the edge of your seat (or whatever).  Like she is so close to losing touch with mundane reality, while at the same time being earthy, sometimes those disarming touches of naivety and humour.  Oh hell, I loved her to bits and wish she was still around.  I'm probably not making much sense......|`|i5YJBqnZaa	Janis did something that all great singers do. She sang from her soul. Did she have a great voice? Not by a long shot. But for singing Rock/Blues it was perfect. She didn't have the looks of many female singers. But she would put them to shame when it came to performing on stage. The woman gave every bit of energy she had when performing. And she could hang with the big boys be it drinking, drugs (sadly), or singing. The little lost girl from Texas was a major force to reckon with.|`|Agw4pXAnaa	For me I like the fact that she wasn't afraid to get up there and do it like the men.  She came from a time where rock was mostly dominated by men.  She wasn't afraid to stand up there and belt it out like a man and throw back whiskey like a man,lol.  She proved us girls can do it too.|`|izY3JNhqaa	IMHO ... the 60's was a time of GREAT NECESSISITY and the students felt it necessary to YELL it out and let people know.  Janis Joplin had a way to put her heart into her music and bellow it from the rafters and yet she was still tolarable, easy to understand, and emphatic.<br>  <br>  Plus, she fit right in with the other artists of the time ...

4wm5kAygaa	The Curious Case of Benjamin Button!! It was so good, I absolutely loved it. It was nominated for 13 oscars, kind of long but definitely worth it. Have fun!!

Your other signs can make a big difference as to how you express those characteristics or influence other parts of your personality.  I'll give you an example, I have 2 friends who were both virgo.  Anyone would have told you they were like night and day.  However, they were both very detailed oriented people, practical, criticial and perfectionists.  One had alot of leo's in her chart, the other had scorpio and libra.  The leo influenced one was louder, more agressive, bossier and voiced her opinions, the other friend was more quiet and introspective.  On the outside they appeared different, but they shared many similar traits on the inside.  I took a quick look at your charts, and would guess that your stepfather is perhaps colder, more aloof and self absorbed?|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	For every Zodiac, we are actually differentiate into a few kinds.

8IqgfXl9aa	Okay:<br>  A duck walks into a bar, and asks the bartender, 'you got any lemons' and the bartender says, 'i'm sorry i don't.' so the duck comes back to the bar the next day and says, 'you got any lemons' and the bartender says, 'no, and if you come back tomorrow and ask for lemons, I'll nail your feet to the bar floor.' so the next day, the duck comes back to the bar and says, 'you got any nails?' and the bartender says, 'no' and the duck says, 'good, then you got any lemons?'<br>  Okay, so there was this creepy old hotel that sat at the top of a hill. A guy's car broke down on the hill once, and the tow couldn't come 'til morning, so he had to stay the night at the hotel. He asks the man at the front desk for a room, and he replies, 'i'm sorry, but we don't have any rooms left, besides room a-13, but everyone thinks its haunted.' the man says that he'll take it anyway, so he does. That night, the man hears a voice coming from the closet saying, 'YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA, YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA.' The man gets so scared, he jumps out the window and dies. The next day, a stuck-up movie star comes to the hotel and asks for a room. again, the only room available was a-13. being stupid, she doesn't listen to the man at the front desk when he tells her that a man was found dead because he jumped out the window the previous night, so she takes the room anyway. That night, the same voice came from the closet saying, 'YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA, YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA'. The movie star gets so scared that she runs out of the room (not before accidentially running into the wall first) and falls down the elevator, and dies. The next day, a professor asks for a room. again, the only room available was a-13. he decides to take the room, despite the man at the front desks' warning. That night, the same voice was coming from the closet, 'YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA, YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA'. The professor decides to check out the closet. Sitting in the closet, is a little boy, picking his nose and saying 'YOU'RE A BIG ONE AND I'M GONNA GETCHA!"<br>  New Joke:<br>  Hilary Clinton, George Bush, a priest, and a high school student were all flying in an airplane once. They realized that the plane was going to crash. However, there were only three parachutes and four of them. <br>  The priest says, 'I need to continue to serve my church. So I'm going to take a parachute.' So, he takes one and jumps out of the airplane. Next, Hilary Clinton says, 'I'm the smartest woman in the world. I have so much more to accomplish, so I'm going to take a parachute.' And she jumps out of the airplane. George Bush says, 'You know, I've served my country long enough. You are still so young, and have so much more to accomplish. So you can take the parachute.' The high school student then says, 'that's okay mr. bush. the 'smartest woman in the world' accidentially took my backpack." <br>  That's all that's coming to mind right now...hope I helped!|`|Y1aAGPURaa	A guy was on the side of the road hitchhiking on a very dark night and in the middle of a storm. The night was rolling on and no car went by. The storm was so strong he could hardly see a few feet ahead of him. <br>  <br>  Suddenly he saw a car coming toward him and stop. <br>  <br>  Without thinking about it, the guy got into the back seat, closed the door and then realized there was nobody behind the wheel! The car starts slowly; the guy looks at the road and sees a curve coming his way. Scared, he starts to pray begging for his life. <br>  <br>  He hasn't come out of shock, when just before he hits the curve, a hand appears through the window and moves the wheel. The guy, paralyzed in terror, watched how the hand appears every time right before a curve. <br>  <br>  Gathering his strength, the guy jumps out of the car and runs to the nearest town. Wet and in shock, he goes to a restaurant and starts telling everybody about the horrible experience he went through. <br>  <br>  A silence enveloped everybody when they realize the guy was serious. <br>  <br>  About half an hour later, two guys walked in the same restaurant. They looked around for a table when one said to the other, "Look John, that's the dummy who got in the car when we were pushing it."<br>  <br>  --------------------------------------...<br>  <br>  It was snowing heavily and blowing to the point that visibility was almost zero when John (not the sharpest pencil in the batch) got off work. <br>  <br>  He made his way to his car and wondered how he was going to make it home. He sat in his car while it warmed up and thought about his situation. <br>  <br>  He finally remembered his dad's advice that if he got caught in a blizzard he should wait for a snow plow to come by and follow it. That way he would not get stuck in a snow drift. <br>  <br>  This made him feel much better and sure enough in a little while a snow plow went by and he started to follow it. <br>  <br>  As he followed the snow plow, he was feeling very smug as they continued and he was not having any problem with the blizzard conditions. <br>  <br>  After an hour had passed, he was somewhat surprised when the snow plow stopped and the driver got out and came back to his car and signaled for him to roll down his window. <br>  <br>  The snow plow driver wanted to know if he was all right as he had been following him for a long time. <br>  <br>  John said that he was fine and told him of his dad's advice to follow a snow plow when caught in a blizzard. <br>  <br>  The driver replied that it was okay with him and he could continue if he wanted, but he was done with the Wal-Mart parking lot and was going over to Sears next.

Y1aAGPURaa	Loved it!!    Here's one for you:<br>  <br>  A man was leaving a convenience store with his morning coffee when he noticed a most unusual funeral procession approaching the nearby cemetery.<br>  A long black hearse was followed by a second long black hearse about 50 feet behind the first one...Behind the second hearse was a solitary man walking a dog on a leash...Behind him, a short distance back, were about 200 men walking single file.<br>   <br>  The man couldn't stand the curiosity...He respectfully approached the man walking the dog and said, 'I am so sorry for your loss, and this may be a bad time to disturb you, but I've never seen a funeral like this...Whose funeral is it?'<br>   <br>  'My wife's.' <br>  'What happened to her?' <br>  The man replied, 'My dog attacked and killed her.' <br>  He inquired further, 'But who is in the second hearse?' <br>  The man answered, 'My mother-in-law...She was trying to help my wife when the dog turned on her.'<br>   <br>  A poignant and thoughtful moment of silence passed between the two men. <br>  'Can I borrow the dog?'  The man replied, 'Get in line.'|`|I8M5kw5Saa	too cute.Sad thing I know that there are men out there who will say so whats wrong with that.....Still very funny|`|d85c9f54c1789376bcbba63672563679aa	LOL!<br>  <br>  I hope this is not based on a true story.

rYA2KCnUaa	I guess it is called denial, I believe that he is still dwelling on the fact that Sharon will comes to her senses and would want to try and work things out between them.  You can not fall out in love with someone overnight.  But, he knows in his heart that Sharon is still in love with Nick.  SO we will see what happens.|`|AA11952412	Jack has always claimed to love the women in his life, but always had some type of agenda with that love.  He got to be CEO of Jabot when he married Patty Williams (Paul's brother), and she went on to lose their baby because she found out about him and his lover.  Nothing has really changed, other than now it is the woman who has feelings for another.  I say it is a case of tit-for-tat - and this time he really loves the woman, but has never really had her whole and complete heart.|`|ce35927379e187a9a9405823379c0faaaa	Jack really loves Sharon...and with good reason. She's beautiful, and makes a perfect wife for him. But unfortunately for him, her heart belongs to someone else. Jack's a fighter. He'll never give up on what he wants. Even if he ends up losing in the long run, he will always be friends with Sharon.|`|e99ea32489fc5dbc539f321016b1f8f7aa	I think Jack suspects the worst with Sharon but realizes he pushed her over the edge with his lies and schemes. He's playing the good guy role hoping she'll turn to him now that Bradley is no longer available to lend an ear and a shoulder.|`|KZV8p4PGaa	Yep, and once he smells Sharon's perfume he'll know who did the horizontal polka with her.  For some reason he still loves that floozy.  He know knows she is madly in love with Nick, but he will not stay away.  Some people are glutten for punishment(or whatever how that saying goes)|`|EPPb5pRBaa	I think Jack really loves her, I think Sharon is confused and only married Jack forget Nick.|`|WJW4qOlUaa	I guess he is hoping that she will change her mind and go back with him! But after he finds out that she slept with his brother he may not be there for her no more!|`|ahOBiGSzaa	Cuz he is such a whining loser where she is concerned.  What is it with the women turning these guys into whiners?  Lily did it to Cane.  Sharon did it to Jack. Just once, I would have like to see him stand up to her.  He knows she did it and he knows she did it with Billy. Gross.|`|F4ZtOfEBaa	He is so madly in love with her.He might be disgusted with her with this brother thing.I wish they would keep incest out of this soap.It is so sickening.|`|5f0111f71db8592710a5d1cb4897be4aaa	lol,,,love the 'door knob ' joke !<br>   I think he still wants Sharon to be his wife ( IF he only knew )<br>   Jack is just a great guy who loves deeply especially his family > I know Jack can be a jerk at times but in all ... I love his character ( and wont hold it against him for marrying Sharon ) Plus,,,Jack is still friends with most of his exes<br>  <br>   Yes,,,I do think he put two and two together !!! Hes not a stupid man ( except when he took Sharon as his wife ) WHY??????|`|fcPiQDwEaa	Well it's Sharon who took the first step to file for divorce, Jack didn't want that, so l can see him still thinking of her as his bff.|`|uKXgg9heaa	I hate how all the women cheat on Jack. He deserves better! I love how he calls Victor The Mustache LMAO!|`|msUIsv8maa	he still loves her he just lied to her all the time
gHxCVVqKaa	If I were to kiss someone on the forehead it could mean either one of two things, either (a) I'm toying with the person to get them sucked into my charms or (b) I'm hopelessly devoted to them.<br>  <br>  However, if someone were to kiss me on the forehead, I would be hopeful but remain skeptical until some greater proof of affection would be displayed.  Primarily though, I would be watching for other signs in connection with the kiss to gage which kind of kiss it was: a casual friendly kiss or a kiss that means much more.<br>  <br>  <br>  I'm a Scorpio.|`|ztzEloj5aa	i kiss my guy on the forehead I am a capricorn - my leo has kisses me on mine<br>  i think it means that they mean a lot to you and really genuinely care about you|`|DyUXsaG3aa	Mine hardly ever kissed me on forehead.

872fcc76954a83920779a9df510b118baa	means you are firey and passionate.  it just also means you should focus your energies on what you really truely want and don't let your negative feelings keep you down for too long.<br>  <br>  i found someone who has a good balance in my chart. My moon is in detriment, and his Sun is in detriment.  his rising is in Cancer and mine is in Leo  we have opposites that also draw us together.  and we understand the differences that we have which sometimes makes us want to look deeper in our relationship,<br>  <br>  Virgo rising also is one that can step back from a situation and detach if they want to. you're probably very creative.  i could see some kind of art or otherwise talents  which require a lot of patience and introspection.  in your chart just from what I see :) Venus in Aries just brings out the fire in you. :)|`|nF7g8nphaa	Venus in Aries is: Love and Sexuality;<br>  wild, passionate, explosive, unpredictable, typeA personality, love forever but not consistently available, flighty, mighty, best sex in your lifetime, over and over.....Not my idea of freight train to hell.<br>  <br>  Taurus Sun is:<br>  solid, stubborn, persistent, constipated, stuck, connected strong with Earth Energy, rooted, grounded, fertile, <br>  <br>  Taurus again in Mercury, which is Communication.<br>  <br>  Capricorn is this Healer Artist Energy.<br>  <br>  Rising is what you are evolving into...<br>  <br>  Mars is doing battle, struggles, standing tall...<br>  <br>  I'm not an astrologer and I don't know the literal traditional meanings for these signs and planets, but what I know from experience and insight, I have shared with you as above and i don't think you got such a bad deal going on there My Love.|`|E2AUPvgOaa	im not sure i fully understand your question, but if your looking for compatibility by zodiac signs, go to yahoo horoscopes and go to the compatibilty tools on the tool bar then put in your sign and your partners and it will tell you how compatible your signs are. hope this helped you :)|`|awLQeRkMaa	<a href="http://astrology.about.com/od/astrologyandrelationships/p/VenusAries.htm" rel="nofollow">http://astrology.about.com/od/astrologya...</a>|`|1PdUecpYaa	my venus is in aries too and i always have short term relationships... there's always something wrong. i'm not the type of girl who's willing to put up with anything... i get very irritated, bored and end the relationships with fights. <br>  but you're a taurus with capricorn moon.. that's a good balance.|`|AA11951392	Sun (to integrate) in Taurus (Enduring and Possessive).<br>  <br>  Like a heavy rock, you are hard to move, but once to start moving you are hard to stop (fixed). You tend to stick with what you have, being reluctant to change. You tend to accumulate wealth, etc (possessive). In your life, you tend to be practical (earth). Your thinking is usually down-to-earth (earth). You are a good listener and are slow to react. You may have a tendency to act because of others, rather than to be be self-caused (passive).<br>  <br>  Moon (to react to) in Capricorn (Prudent and Reserved)<br>  <br>  Your ability to start new things (cardinal) may be governed (passive) by your emotions (Moon, react to) and you might not feel good unless you are being practical (earth) and holding back your feelings (reserved). You may find that what you are doing is not what you really want (passive), but you will probably carry on anyway (fixed), doing what you have always done (react to) because it has given you the material wherewithal to live well (prudent). <br>  <br>  Rising in Virgo (Analytical and Critical)<br>  <br>  You can often give the impression of someone who is very put-together, almost meticulously groomed. You hold yourself in a very modest and dignified, sometimes snooty, manner, and you seem like you would be into high fashion or at least keeping up appearances. Even if you're feeling sociable or boisterous, you may look to the world like a wallflower, like you've got something very serious on your mind. With a Virgo Rising Sign, you might find yourself fielding health-related questions from your friends and family -- you just seem like you'd have the answers!<br>  <br>  Venus (to harmonise) in Aries (energetic and urgent).<br>  <br>  You enjoy being first (cardinal) in matters related to fashion and beauty. You may also seek new forms of entertainment. You follow your pleasures energetically and urgently. You must have it! You are direct and you might be too direct in areas of romance, even coarse (active, Venus in detriment). You may fall in love with someone at sight and have a whirlwind romance (cardinal). <br>  <br>  Mars (to assert) in Pisces (Impressionable and Inspirational)<br>  <br>  You tend to be pulled in opposite directions (two fishes) so you find it difficult to follow a personal goal. You are not self-assertive with others, mainly for the previous reason. You have a great deal of energy to fuel the imagination. And you may be psychic (impressionable). While you find it difficult to pursue personal goals, you can follow group goals, or religious goals. You tend to motivated to do things (Mars) by outside influences (or transcendent forces) rather than for yourself (passive). You are adaptable (mutable) and model yourself to whoever you are with, sometimes becoming highly assertive (Mars) about what you perceive the other believes or wants. You enjoy films (Pisces), and may be attracted to those involving conflict (Mars) and self-sacrifice (Neptune as ruler of Pisces), where the goal is not personal survival or glory, but some transcendent value. <br>  <br>  Mercury (communicate) in Taurus (Enduring and Possessive).<br>  <br>  You have a good mind and can concentrate well (fixed). You may be a little slow, however (earth), but you can be very persistent (enduring). You may also be slow to take up an issue (fixed), but when you start there is no stopping you. You tend to avoid conflict and express yourself in an indirect manner (passive). You are practical in your communications, and tend to speak when there is a good, practical reason to do so (earth). <br>  <br>  Love & Blessings <br>  Milly

Then you can leave a message and then he can hear it but he cant talk to you. Hope i helped!!

fKcr6KU0aa	Hmm...this is a tough one, since most of the action anime I know tends to tip toward being too serious.  Or are mostly comedy (like Hayate the Combat Butler).<br>  <br>  Seconding Air Gear and Katekyo Hitman Reborn.<br>  <br>  Hunter x Hunter and Yuu Yuu Hakusho both have serious and funny parts, and are both very much action/adventure shounen anime.  Gurren Lagann, too.<br>  <br>  ...Scrapped Princess, maybe?  It's heavily weighed towards the "serious" end of the spectrum, but it has some pretty funny moments.  Plus, it's just awesome.<br>  <br>  Fushigi Yuugi, if you don't mind there being some really melodramatic romance mixed in there.  Fushigi Yuugi's one of those shows that can fluctuate between deadly serious and drop-down hilarious at the drop of a hat.  And it definitely has action.|`|Bdgza4G2aa	Ranma 1/2 seems to be exactly what you are looking for. It is manga and subbed/dubbed anime. It is very action-oriented and filled with comedy, at often times the humor being completely unpredictable.<br>  However, if that is not your 'cup of tea', try Black Cat. It has epic and intense action with a serious storyline, but the interactions between the characters is hilarious. I think that you would like it!|`|CMrkxNmcaa	Air gear, i love it, given its action but with a roller blade theme. i think youll love it!|`|qn46n8Esaa	What about "Sailormoon", I thought it was quite funny and action.|`|H1pDLHByaa	Trigun (Definitely the most like what you're looking for.

rjsfiWt9aa	I know what you mean, that song can be confusing if you actually listen to the lyrics. At some moments i think its about someone wanting to  get out of a bad relationship that was making them "sick and tired" or just frustrated. <br>  <br>  Although at other times i think there in a relationship that they want to stay in but the other person doesnt want to "id be lying if i told you losing you was somthing i could handle" "Im burning for you burning like a candle"<br>  <br>  I dont really know the story behind the song, although it is a very good song.

cUH60vdGaa	yep, start writing your own stuff as soon as possible. if you wanna make music as a full time job, treat it as a full time job - put in the necessary hours of work needed to create the sounds you hear in your head.<br>  <br>  as a devoted alternative rock fan, for what it's worth - a decent myspace page goes a long way, as do free badges or stickers - or start handing out CD-Rs. something to catch potential fans' attention that will make them remember you.<br>  <br>  as for recommendations - which bands do you already draw influence from? it might be good to get out of your comfort zone and try something new, whatever it may be - alternative is a pretty diverse and interesting genre, and a fun one to explore.<br>  <br>  good luck :)|`|YIbELNRBaa	Be different.

bzzUBEmQaa	Any wave editing software can do this as long as you have the right plugins. Personally, I use Sound Forge. Record your voice and pitch it down while maintaining the length. Then throw a little reverb or whatever your like onto it. You can also do this on the fly by passing the microphone channel into a vocoder program or in Ableton Live by throwing the mic onto its own channel and adding the necessary effects. If you don't want to record your own voice, you can use AT&T's Text-to-Speech Voice Synth or a VST vocal synth to do the same thing.

H1pDLHByaa	you could just wear one of the kimonos if you want to. no problem with that. when i went to my first con just a bit ago i just wore a lolita dress, and there were a lot of other people there like me who were just wearing lolita dresses or clothes of Japanese fashion. some people even really liked my outfit.<br>  <br>  and trust me, it'd be a lot better to not cosplay at all then to cosplay as something that took you only a week. decent cosplays are planned months before hand. just saying that you should try to avoid looking ridiculous at all costs.<br>  <br>  and by the way, about what happens at cons, it all depends on the con. you should check out the site for the con, there's bound to be one. you can find out about all the activities there, there's different ones for every con. at the con i went to there were rooms where you could just relax and watch anime, contests, discussion rooms, video game rooms, etcetc. but you don't even need to do all that stuff to have fun. i just watched anime with my friend, talked and met some new people, and ate some food at the cafe at the hotel. oh, and there will be a room or two with stands of people selling things. you should check them out, especially the independent stands. they sell some unique and one of a kind stuff!<br>  oh and if people ask for your picture, don't be weirded out! be flattered; they just like your outfit. and remember to make a cute pose; DON'T just stand there.<br>  <br>  have fun at the con! don't be too worried about what you're supposed to do. cons are meant to be fun and relaxed. :D|`|zhL83fSlaa	Try to find a cheep costume off ebay.

CQX3TAIoaa	M.G. Darling <br>  From Intercross: Ouri is a girl who dreams of getting married to someone who will protect her, just like her dad protected her mom. When she refuses an arranged betrothal to someone she doesn't know, her mom insists she attends Clover Academy, where there are plenty of fiancee candidates. Rumors about her quickly spread around the school, causing many boys to swarm around her. Then, caught in a pinch, she's suddenly rescued by a "Meteorite Guardian" named Night, who is now contracted to Ouri to protect her...<br>  <br>  This sounds like it's it.<br>  Is it?<br>  I don't know it, but I looked through MangaTraders with the information I pulled from your summary.<br>  Good luck!

L2nbez3caa	Well all I can say is wow, Nagato looks like he's about to die.<br>  <br>  As far as him being defenseless, it looks that way, but there are two things that are telling me we shouldn't write him off as being useless once the Pain bodies are dead.<br>  <br>  1. The Rinnegan. We have no idea what else those eyes can do, and if they are indeed stronger than the Sharigan, I'm willing to bet they can do more than just let you use all 5 elements. Nagato might have some crazy techniques up his sleeve once these bodies die.<br>  <br>  2. Robotics. Nagato has shown that he is capable of using technology that we didn't even think existed in the Narutoverse. Asura Pain was a android, and Nagato is hooked up too some kind of robot. I'm willing to bet that that thing he is hooked up to has offensive and defensive skills, and he perhaps may have some kind of external suit, that he can use to fight in.<br>  <br>  Sure I could be dead wrong with this, however I don't think Nagato is quite as useless as many of us think, even though he's virtually on his death bed.<br>  <br>  ______________________________________...<br>  Naruto 437 Prediction<br>  <a href="http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://my-naruto-blog.blogspot.com/</a>|`|f92qLn2Vaa	<a href="http://edgarluvitug.wordpress.com/2009/02/20/naruto-437-confirmed-spoiler/" rel="nofollow">http://edgarluvitug.wordpress.com/2009/0...</a>|`|xjkb1kJraa	6-tails|`|dYQUQGflaa	umm, when you read it's not called episode it's called CHAPTER.<br>  <br>  And I'm pretty sure they will find nagato and it'll just keep getting dumber.

H1pDLHByaa	NANA! i can't stress enough how amazing that anime is. it is by far my favorite.<br>  <br>  Paradise Kiss is great too.<br>  <br>  and, some others too:<br>  Chobits<br>  xxxHOLiC<br>  Fruits Basket<br>  Last Quarter (not an anime, only a manga, but it's worth the read)<br>  Ouran High School Host Club<br>  Loveless|`|xERwr6Ukaa	I really like:<br>  Code Geass: It's a great action, involves intellect, has great mystery and suspense.<br>  Sailor Moon: Though it seems like a kidish show, it's actually really great as it goes along, and it's my favorite!<br>  Bleach: This show has a great storyline and it's hilarious, a great anime, definently worth it!<br>  Inuyasha: It has a little romance and a lot of fantasy and I highly reccommend it, it has great comedy in it too!<br>  I hope this helped!|`|AA11183969	Slam Dunk<br>  Death Note (manga)<br>  Bleach<br>  Spirited Away<br>  <br>  Slam Dunk's cool because it is based on reality decisions, unlike Captain Tsubasa (Soccer anime). The movements of the basketball players in Slam Dunk are realistic in accordance to the basketball game in reality (except a few of Hanamichi's illogical over-energized plays). Captain Tsubasa features unrealistic and illogical movements in soccer. For example, two players kicking the ball at once to produce a super-fast shot and the so-called Raiju kick. Don't watch Captain Tsubasa if you are a real fan of soccer. Also, Japan beating Brazil to win the Youth Championship? Give me a break. <br>  <br>  Death Note mixes supernatural and reality (kind of reminded me of X-files). Its better if u read the comic. I haven't watch the movie but I've read the comic and it was damn awesome. The drawing is realistic (unlike other anime drawings where there are big eyes and super-cute faces...ugh!) I especially liked the way detective L and Light Yagami think. Made me wanna be a detective too. Lol.<br>  <br>  I liked Bleach because of its plot, movement, soundtracks and the special effects (I liked the one when Kenpachi went against Ichigo). However, the anime starts to suck in the few latest episodes. The movement of the sword-swinging shinigamis became uncool although the plot is still there.<br>  <br>  Spirited Away? Hands-down. The 2002 Academy Award winner deserves to be watched by every anime fan. Even though its a little childish, but the plot is very interesting. The characters are funny and strange and queer. It makes u keep guessing what will happen next and normally, ur guesses won't be correct.<br>  <br>  Well, I think that's it.|`|PDxQWnlraa	The best animes I have ever seen are the following<br>  <br>  .

Hopefully, they won't, at least not until after he gets help through counseling and anger management.  Any man who could snap to the point that he beats a woman that he is supposedly in love with to that extent cannot be trusted to not do it again unless there is MASSIVE intervention happening in the meantime.|`|G7OwyyHPaa	i think they will.<br>  <br>  i actually do think Chris Brown is sorry, he doesn't seem like the kind of guy that would do that and not feel guilty about it.|`|1Cnaphybaa	if they get back together , then i shall start to think rihanna is stupid.but it does happen in abusive relationships.|`|IFoFxYp7aa	They shouldn't.<br>  He obviously has a bad temper.|`|gzj523OUaa	No they are not|`|Ful1uVtgaa	I do.

8W7PJAw7aa	Sell<br>  <br>  Doom has the more consistent catalogue (including work with the Monsta Island Czars and anything done with Madlib, MF Grimm, etc), but the longevity, ability to renew the style, and the frequently changing (while still maintaining one of the highest levels of complexity) rhyme scheme make Nas the better of the two<br>  <br>  Great comparison, though.<br>  <br>  I would also like to state that the winner of this comparison is not, and should not be, obvious. If you think Nas is clearly/obviously superior to Doom, then you need to step your game up.|`|l72FO4eMaa	We've had this ? before. I love it.

Then of course Scorpios, and Gemini's are so good at manipulating they can get people to believe anything.|`|OgaJqkSQaa	Air signs, but not so much Aquarius. Aquarians are too open to be smooth talkers. I'd say Gemini followed by Libra.|`|XVGmGCDaaa	I'm gonna vote that it's Libra too!!!  They can talk their way out of anything and even if it's not the truth, they'll make you believe them.  Trust me.  I know this one for fact.|`|8DN2jyRsaa	air signs are the talkers and communicators,libra,aquarius,gemini|`|awLQeRkMaa	Yep I'm gonna say all the air signs gemini, libra aquarius.|`|XJTynEaMaa	Gemini and Aquarius|`|mG8gDExGaa	I think if you have alot of planets in libra or gemini.

CL5kLE2paa	who cares?|`|BvHRriEyaa	From what I have read, it's spreading fast. So, yes it seems she only has a few weeks, I don't know how many, I have no experience at all in this sort of thing.<br>  <br>  I'm not sure I could be so positive and everything either, but she has her children and everything... it's really so sad :(<br>  <br>  EDIT - to the people saying about it being her last night, what they are referring to is that her nusband (who she has just married) has had special permission to break his curfew so they can spend their wedding night together! Not that she is going to die after tonight :/<br>  <br>  And, I agree with the person below me, I also never liked her really but I would never have wished anything like this to happen!!|`|Xl82sK4haa	She is making the most of what time she has left without wallowing in self-pity in public. Never really liked her but I have to admire her for her spirit and outlook.|`|yNNnkze5aa	i dont think shes quite grasped the idea that shes dying. like she agreed to die on camera. To me that just aint right and i think shes in denial.<br>  but yeah i heard it was 4 months so i dunno|`|96ndKQncaa	not long apparently<br>  watched a news update ealier, because today was her wedding day and she got married to jack.<br>  they have said it could be her 'last night'...<br>  i hope not. i think thats a bit of a lie|`|ZH91TAHPaa	Less than that.<br>  The news said she might be spending her only night with her new husband tonight.|`|VlTGV9DUaa	nahh nowhere near 6 weeks<br>  i give her 2 at the most <br>  its so sad!<br>  x|`|sAnjLhbgaa	In truth only God knows! doctors and PR men can only speculate. All the best to her.|`|1UHDLGLlaa	She has to be strong to set a positive image of hope for fellow sufferers and the people around her & her sons. <br>  <br>  She also just got married so I'm, sure that has made her very happy. <br>  <br>  She is also in the public eye... so probally makes an effort to make her self look nice.|`|5rRgcedhaa	a few weeks|`|jJCBGGHbaa	bout 6 - 12 weeks|`|FcHplZtQaa	on her documentary it said 4 to 8wks, and that was 1wk ago|`|2a826ea115eb0860ddf6dc2e0ed050b4aa	Jade looks very, very ill.  Look into her eyes!|`|98WKYtfwaa	Well some people prefer to call months, weeks instead. <br>  <br>  Don't know how long she's got, not long anyway. I'd probably say about 8weeks at the very most. Cancer that's spreading fast does kill quite fast. <br>  <br>  It's such a shame, especially on her boys.|`|XBYiHaWIaa	No they gave her 1-2 months, which IS a matter of weeks! Plus her condition has gotten worse so obviously her life expectancy has changed!|`|29def525b4de3e4f1e95aaabfaa25f77aa	I'm sure if she has a "miraculous recovery" she'll videotape that for television as well.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Dont think she has long,id say weeks,its so sad...

CrAwmz65aa	If these were objective questions, I might also say DYOH.<br>  But since these were questions to stimulate thought, I guess I'll add my own opinions:<br>  <br>  1. I guess not.  They don't have a counterpart in Busoni's Turandot.<br>  They are probably added in order to provide humor.<br>  Come to think of it, Puccini does a lot of this sort of thing.  Witness the landlord in La Boheme and the Sacristan in Tosca.<br>  <br>  2. In several of Grimm's Fairy Tales, a character has to answer riddles in order to marry a princess.  I once made a compilation of those fairy tales, wrote it up as "Survey of Marital Compatibility Inventories," and submitted it to the Journal of Polymorphous Perversity, which is a magazine which spoofs psychological journals.  I thought my article was pretty good, but the editor didn't think so.<br>  <br>  3. I've never thought about that before.  Probably because the Lotus Blossom theme is pentatonic, and the pentatonic mode in turn suggests children.  (For example, The Farmer in the Dell, Old MacDonald, and Mary Had a Little Lamb are all pentatonic.  It's no accident that the Kodaly method starts with songs in the pentatonic mode.)  <br>  <br>  The American Wallingford Riegger (1885-1961) seemed to think the Lotus Blossom theme was a good song for children, because he included that song in a violin beginner book which he wrote.  In case you need the documentation, it's:<br>  <br>  Riegger, W.  1924.  Begin with pieces: An elementary method for individual or class instruction of beginners on the violin.  New York: G. Schirmer: #71.<br>  <br>  4.  I'm afraid you got me on this one.  There is no accounting for popular tastes.  Ever since I joined this forum, I have wondered why we get daily questions about Bella's Lullaby and Yiruma's The River Runs.  I have even analyzed both of those pieces in search of some clue, but to no avail.<br>  <br>  We get a sneak preview of the melody when the Unknown Prince reminds Turandot that she doesn't know his name, we hear the aria near the beginning of one of the scenes, and we hear it for the last time at the very end of the opera.  It is this last factor which sends the audience humming the melody as they wind their way homeward.  <br>  <br>  Compare this with "E luvecan le stelle" from Tosca, which gets a sneak preview near the beginning of the last act, when gets a rendition during the act, and is restated at the very end of the opera.  <br>  <br>  Wagner opens and closes Der Meistersinger, Tannhauser, and Lohengrin with the same melody.  Carl Orff  opens and closes Carmina Burana with O Fortuna, which is another melody which gets daily recognition on this forum.  (One contributor to this forum has referred to such melodies as "bookends.")  If you need more documentation for your paper, see what you can dig up on the "primacy effect," the "frequency effect," and the "recency effect."|`|9ee25102a7763535588f4a899e88f4dcaa	Sounds suspiciously like homework to me. Hopefully, you live in a country with unlimited internet access and search engines like Google. You might even be able to get hold of a recording of Turandot and listen to the music yourself.<br>  <br>  DO YOU OWN HOMEWORK!|`|Vv7IvSEjaa	Further to the excellent answer above, I think the popularity of 'Nessum Dorma' is due to Pavarotti. <br>  The aria was also used in an advertisement making people (who oridinary never listen to Opera) sit up and take notice.<br>  <br>  The same thing happened to Tchaikowsky's 5th symphony (in Australia). The main theme was used in an ad to advertise a brand of cigarettes. As a result, just about everyone who watched TV in that era can now recognise that 'tune'.|`|ca64f074806522d41931e7a2676ce936aa	To answer the last question, and to assist suhawak, the reason is quite simple. It was used in the UK as the them tune for, I think the 1992, World Football cup. Before that, it was not well known or popular at all. Following that footbore festival, there was the Three Tenors Concert (Pavarotti, Domingo and Carreras) where it was sung again and it caught the public imagination and is now heard ad nauseam. Good tune though|`|rUn7TyQPaa	Re. nessun dorma, Byjorling did it better.

kAvgkLxPaa	Well...I was like you. With the exception that I tended to sing out more when there's a whole group of people singing as well (eg. during school songs).<br>  <br>  Your singing teacher isn't there to criticize you, he/she wants to help you. It's natural for new students to be afraid and shy - they've probably seen all kinds of students already, some of whom have good voices, others whom they're not sure would ever be able to sing properly. You won't be the worst student that your teacher has seen. And chances are, if you love singing and you want to sing in front of others, you probably have a decent voice to start with. Don't let that one comment which was made so long ago get you down. Who's to say that your voice hasn't improved since? And if you do get a good singing teacher whom you click with, your voice will definitely improve significantly - and you'll slowly get more comfortable singing in front of others. I wouldn't even sing loudly during lessons when I first started, and it used to drive my teacher insane because nothing she did could ever get me to sing out more so that she could teach me properly. LOL. But now, I'm pretty alright. Still not the most open singer you would find, but it's getting better.<br>  <br>  You could start with singing along to a CD or something, in your room with the door closed/locked. Then slowly, you can start leaving the door unlocked, and then slightly ajar. You can also get together with a good friend and sing together. I know I'm more comfortable singing with a friend/my teacher than I am in front of my own family. Or you could join a community choir where you'll get to meet other people who share your passion.<br>  <br>  Good luck!|`|6Ysh039uaa	i felt the same way when i first started taking voice lessons, i was extremely, extremely shy about singing as well. for the first month of lessons i sang so quietly my voice teacher couldn't even hear me, and he was sitting 3 feet away from me lol. but after awhile i warmed up to the idea and got more comfortable with singing in front of other people and i've been singing for years now. it is really terrifying at first the thought of putting yourself out there, but if it's something you love then i say go for it. as far as your teacher goes, i wouldn't worry about it. like you said you had a cold, and besides that maybe she was just having a bad day herself. either way, that was a long time ago, so i wouldn't let it worry you. If music is something you love, i think you should just go for it. it doesn't matter what people think of your singing, what matters is that it's something you enjoy doing and it makes you happy :] hope this helps.|`|QDyqApOgaa	Don't be afraid to sing. look at those people on American Idol, they're probably afraid to but think that they're good and that's why they sound horrible. Like everything else, singing takes practice. Even Robert Plant from Led Zeppelin, or famous opera singers sounded bad when they started. People will only respect your courage and willingness to practice singing.|`|1kJgH91Jaa	I DO THE EXACT SAME THING AS YOU!<br>  I'm gonna say, give it a shot.<br>  It's not like anybody can say you didn't try<br>  <br>  I'm actually wondering the exact same thing about myself.<br>  <br>  Please, answer my question:<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AmofEPF9oBZCm4arsvU8.Qzsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090222194408AAC8ZHC">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index;...</a>|`|Ne3Z1xwWaa	FIRST THING YOU DO WHEN YOUR ABOUT TO SING IN FRONT OF PEOPLE IS TO TELL YOURSELF THAT YOUR DOING IT FOR YOU NOT FOR THEM AND WHO CARE WHAT THEY THINK ONLY GOD CAN JUDE YOU GOOD LUCK HON !!!! omg i didnt even noctice the caps was on lol im not shouting just for you too know lol

While tracking down the bomber, Carlin gets an idea in his head: could they use the device to actually travel back in time and not only prevent the bombing but also the murder of a local woman whose truck was used in the bombing?

ad4ac1203a5f72a5c427680e06c5d512aa	Its the other way around. Social and economic issues have an effect on music. Music is not the driver, music is the follower. It reflects what people are feeling by expressing it in an art form.|`|InAICv25aa	I remembered the story of the premier of Stravinsky's rite of spring, where a huge riot started, and tons of people came to blows. <br>  <br>  "The complex music and violent dance steps depicting fertility rites first drew catcalls and whistles from the crowd. At the start with the opening bassoon solo, the audience began to boo loudly due to the slight discord in the background notes behind the bassoon's opening melody. There were loud arguments in the audience between supporters and opponents of the work. These were soon followed by shouts and fistfights in the aisles. The unrest in the audience eventually degenerated into a riot. The Paris police arrived by intermission, but they restored only limited order. Chaos reigned for the remainder of the performance, and Stravinsky himself was so upset on account of its reception that he fled the theater in mid-scene, reportedly crying."<br>  <br>  Just thought this was an interesting story. Obviously music does good things too. I read somewhere that in Penn Station the train station, they realized that less homeless people loiter around when they put Mozart and Haydn on their public speakers.

DUg1IkTIaa	It's my understanding that the LOST Tapes on Animal Planet are actual videos that exist, so there are NO Actors involved.|`|28d1daabadd63d26e86fd71474b9230daa	LOL...I'm watching the show right now, and I was thinking the same thing...especially on the Oklahoma Octopus one...it took me a minute to figure out whether it was fake or not...apparently its based on a true story, which means its pretty much like America's Most Wanted<br>  <br>  Coming from the entertainment world though, I can say that the people who act on these types of shows are very small time actors. When we do castings for commercials, we get these types of people all the time...they get to list in on their resume, and really, it does help them still because they get cast more often when they have more experience.
GtalVPNjaa	Some good answers there. You should also consider that  often an orchestra is called a "symphony orchestra" which relates in some ways to its size. A chamber orchestra is far smaller consisting of for instance 4 cellos as opposed to maybe 8 or even 10  in a symphony orchestra. Recordings of pre-romantic period orchestral works are better suited to chamber orchestras, whereas works by composers like Mahler and Sibelius require far larger orchestras|`|p4q9R2RFaa	An orchestra is a classical ensemble of musicians - usually consisting of a string, woodwind, brass and timpani/percussive section. A symphony is a classical piece divided into movements.<br>  <br>  EDIT: Why all of the thumbs down, is it something I said?|`|ziFMYqtoaa	That's like asking what's the difference between a song and a singer!  The orchestra plays the symphony!|`|CeswlNpVaa	A symphony is a musical piece done with lot of instruments of same kinds.<br>  Whereas  an Orchestra is a group containing all the Instruments and making a music.<br>  THANK YOU MY FRIEND|`|rNqF4gIVaa	A symphony is a piece of music. An orchestra is the group of musicians playing it.|`|qThmcR1Aaa	Orchestras play symphonies!

6Ysh039uaa	pandora's (www.pandora.com)  a really good music for finding new music based off of the music you already like. you just enter the name of the song or artist/band in the search box and it gives you a whole radio station that plays songs similar to your interests and you can give them a thumbs up or down so they know whether to play music like that particular song again. i've found a lot of good music that way :] lol hope this helps!|`|SAaEiqHvaa	promoonly.com|`|uuuzDqM9aa	mtv.com,or music.com but mtv is the best :)
kaUE3xmBaa	Definitely. I saw it when I was very young, and it's really not that bad on the surface. There's some intense scenes and the whole plot is a little bit disturbing, but not in a bad way. Just in a way that you have to think about it. There's nothing too graphic about it though, and it's a very well made movie.|`|4c54a4a8ce56ab2290888626b8f1b46faa	yeah, it;s a good movie for adults also|`|ccb402364f76559985af31b2ece8e3ccaa	yeah.

A lot of Christians do too if they can't afford a big wedding. But as others said, you could get married anywhere these days; the beach, a park, a Cruise ship, skydiving, etc. A woman at work married a Goth and they had the ceremony at one of those Haunted House attractions on Halloween :). And you don't need a minister,either. A marriage can be performed by a Court Judge, a Mayor, or if you go to Vegas, Elvis :p|`|Q2lj91nmaa	No, most atheists wouldn't marry in a church. Including me.

But if you don't want anything explicit, then that's not the way to go.<br>  If you want some bands that aren't as heavy as the others, I'd go for All Time Low, The Maine, Death Cab For Cutie, Mayday Parade, Modest Mouse, etc.<br>  If you want really heavy metal/screamo, there's Bring Me The Horizon, Escape The Fate, The Devil Wears Prada, or stuff like that.<br>  Also, the band Calvary Kids do covers of some popular hip-hop songs. (:<br>  If you're looking into Alternative rock, there's 30 Seconds To Mars, Fall Out Boy, Forever The Sickest Kids, The Academy Is..., or The Starting Line.<br>  A few more bands are Boys Like Girls, Skillet, Nirvana, Sublime, From First To Last, Every Avenue, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, Led Zeppelin, Lynard Skynard, Fountains Of Wayne, Weezer, Say Anything, Lifehouse, Nickelback, or Guns 'N Roses.<br>  I tried my best.

Z15TM1VQaa	Tokyo Crazy Paradise<br>  After the death of her parents, Tsukasa turns to her classmate Ryuji, a yakuza boss, for shelter and a job. Ryuji is generally grave, but purposefully indebts Tsukasa to him so that she has to keep working for him, and he can keep his friend near him. Tsukasa is a simple-minded girl who desperately searches for money to pay off her debts to Ryuji. To make money, she takes on suspicious jobs in addition to being Ryuji's bodyguard, but always ends up in trouble. Ryuji and Tsukasa take turns saving each other as they fight together against the spread of dangerous drugs and weaponry that would destroy Tokyo even more than it has already degraded.<br>  <br>  Tail of the Moon aka: Tsuki no Shippo<br>  Becoming a ninja is the best think that can happen for fifteen year old Usagi, but it’s impossible! Usagi is only good with herbs and making medicine, she can’t even do the basic things all ninjas know and everyone knows that. The only thing is she wants to be a ninja so she can go on missions and leave the small village she has always lived in. One day Usagi’s great grandfather (the leader of the village) tells her that he has an assignment that only she can do, “marry Hanzo Hattori and bare his children”. Usagi along with Mamezo (a child she has raised from a young age) go to Segachi, the place Hanzo lives at. Hanzo instantly rejects Usagi the moment he finds out why she came, but she doesn’t leave and he is made her ninja instructor by… Her grandfather? With love on the horizon, enemies almost around every corner, a strict teacher, and her ex-fiancé Goemon around all the time, will she be able to do such a treacherous life-long task?<br>  <br>  666 Satan aka: O-Parts Hunter<br>  The life of an ordinary young girl named Ruby Crescent changed dramatically when she hears her father died and she became a treasure hunter like her father (someone that hunts for O-Parts). O-Parts are these magical items that grant people different kinds of superhuman powers, but can only be used by special people called O.P.T. (O-Part Tactician) or by angels and devils. On her journey Ruby meets a young boy named Jio, who seeks to conquer the world. Due to his dark past Jio is mean to Ruby when they meet, but after a while ends up traveling with her as her body guard. When Ruby gets attacked by an O.P.T clamming to be Satan, Jio ends up rushing to her rescue and starts to battle that O.P.T. Only to be on the losing side of course until Jio releases his true power only to be revealed not only as an O.P.T but also as the real Satan. After this small incident with the fake Satan, Jio decides to continue traveling with Rose with hopes that they can find out more about the past, but that is just the beginning of the story. More battles happen and more enemies appear only for them to have quite a complicated life. The style is similar to the Naruto manga because its author is the younger twin brother of Masashi Kishimoto.<br>  <br>  Dragon Quest Dai no Daiboken<br>  The story is about a young boy named Dai who dreams about being a hero. One day a demon threatens the world and Dai, along with friends he meets on the way, go to try and stop the demon.<br>  <br>  Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles<br>  It's about a group of four people that come from different dimentions; there names are Syaoran, Sakura, Fay, and Kurogane.

The characters are often admired for resiliency in the face of epic struggles that put life and humanity in the balance. Viewers take pleasure in the highly dramatized nature of the production, and those who enjoy it the most find both personal empowerment by directing the mind to noble ideals, as well as because it seems more "real" than high school --- they take solace in thinking that their lack of social success is not a product of their inherent worth, but because of its artifice that suppresses unrecognized potential. There might be other reasons to enjoy it too. Half-naked women, styles of artwork, exotic cultures etc. <br>  <br>  One of the standout features of anime, which it shares with certain types of science fiction and fantasy, is a heightened emphasis on artifice: things exist arbitrarily (or not at all for some like the Matrix) revealing the lust for power at core of most human motivation (lots of anime lovers like reading Nietzsche too for his comments on this). So of course anime lovers will be distrustful of those who don't like it. They may call you small-minded because they will assume your opinion to be your complicity with brute inhumanity. Its a very manichean worldview that is fairly unforgiving in the grey areas between good and evil where there can only be winners, and never compromises.<br>  <br>  Here's an observation. People who don't feel continually frustrated in their social standing often don't watch anime. The anime lovers will say this is because they are "small minded" -- either they don't have the faculties to recognize their disempowerment and modes of rebellion, or they are simply the possessors of resources that appear to have no intrinsic moral worth -- like looks, popularity, cars, etc. But it could equally be levelled against the anime lovers that THEY are evincing a rather myopic view of the world by devoting a lot of time to feeding a sense of persecution (which they assume to be metaphysically grounded) rather than getting on with the business of life and bearing the shackles of personal responsibility which are the mark of adulthood. Should they choose to join the ranks of productive people, you will find their interest in anime diminishes. Not because of "selling out" their interests in work environments that are hostile to it, but because the vision it expounds is either escapist or only somewhat tangential to the history of political structuring in the western tradition. More knowledge and greater opportunities for self-determination subdue the anime fanatic-turned-aggressor. Since these are not to be found in high school, you'll just have to excuse them if they become too rambunctious.  But their interests can often align with things like literary traditions, scientific outlooks, and linguistic appreciation. Should you enjoy these things, but not anime, they can still be an interesting resource to tap into.|`|frqfB0usaa	-.- Grow up and get a life? That's your opinion but its kinda harsh. Anime is for all sorts off ages and whats wrong with watching it?<br>  I know adults that watch it, should they grow up and get a life?<br>  So the only reason your friends with your friends is because they like twilight?(I know you didn't say it butthat'ss the way it sounds) Personally i think you should grow up and learn that friends are precious and if you give them up for something as trivial as watching anime you will only regret it in time.<br>  <br>  I used to be a majour Twilight fan but after seeing stuff like this it keeps putting me off and off -.-|`|MMI8S60Vaa	Anime is good, in my opinion. In japan, kids watch it, teenagers watch it, grownups watch it, old people watch it. Besides, it's not really a cartoon, just a kind of animation. And, if you watch a telivision show, any television show, it's about the same as watching anime. After all, anime is just a kind of TV show.  BUT, if you don't like it, that's just your opinion, and your friends have thier opinion. You shouldn't just get all new friends just because of liking something you don't. I mean, if you said that you hated dogs and your friend said that she loved dogs, you wouldn't just break up with her and go and find new friends, would you? Everyone can have thier own opinion.|`|Ly9z6qS3aa	Wow. <br>  Firstly, do you expect all of your friends to be exact copies of you? You are not worthy of having friends if you dump them over what makes them who they are.<br>  <br>  Secondly, a cartoon is Spongebob Squarepants. If you see one TV show, and you don't like it, are you going to say that all TV is bad? Not all animation is for children. I am not joking, you would be suprised by the number of R-rated animated movies out there. Anime is just as diverse as any genre of music, movies, books or TV. There are animes for preschoolers and bloody porn animes. Just about any genre you’ve seen in Hollywood films or TV has had numerous anime series.They have VAMPIRE ROMANCES and fantasies and historical dramas. There are several anime adaptions of Shakespeare plays, Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Othello, A Midsummer's Night Dream and more. They are Westerns, action adventures romances, comedies, and sci-fi. Don't judge the entire genre. I could jude you by what you have written, and I would say that you are a petty, prejudiced jerk. I'm sure that's not the real you. <br>  Third, you like Twilight. You should grow up and get a life. They're all FICTIONAL people. Grow up.<br>  I'm a Twilighter, and I'M offended by that statement, for crying out loud, and I wrote it. you offend me when you say that about anime. I wouldn't be suprised if Stephanie Meyer approved a Twilight graphic novel. You give Twilighters, and Twilight, a bad name when you display this kind of petty childishness.<br>  Maybe your friends should dump you. I certainly wouldn't want to be friends with you. I think that YOU are the one that needs to grow up.|`|pTERJdzQaa	To be honest with you: I have never actual read Twilight before, I have heard about it so many times, I think that I might check it out.<br>  <br>  Anyway......You dont have to like Anime if you dont want to, I mean, its not like someone is going to plan a hit(murder) on you if you have an opposition to Anime.<br>  <br>  You should really give Anime a chance though, yes its a cartoon, but cartoons are good for all ages, theres no age limit for cartoons and Anime.|`|T5Du5Rtvaa	What does Twilight have to do with this..? Anyways are you insane! Friends are precious people you cant just throw them away like trash! So what if you dont like anime and they do they're still your friends! I'm the only person in my small group of friends who likes anime and my friends know that and respect it. They dont really care what i do in my spare time at home and vise-versa. Keep your friends close to you but if you can just dump them like trash then your not worthy to have friends.<br>  <br>  lols hope i helped and sry for the rant|`|36hPlvRQaa	haha u are looser<br>  however no anime is not cartton, what is that anyway? hmm l:S<br>  and lol what has watching anime to do with having a life and growing up? and even if it would, so what if i choose not to grow up? whachya gonna do? make me! ghaha go grow up urself and be oldie that watches soap operas and crappy twilight movies x]<br>  <br>  besidez...evarr heard of art or hobbies? i as well can say stop reading twilight dumbass and grow up!<br>  <br>  thumbs down to this question, becoz of uselessness and not having valuable point on why one should stop watching anime..um..because some some twilight fangirl said so? oh pleaaz don't make laugh =D|`|WuWyo1PXaa	I don't think you should dump your friends because you have one thing that's not in common. I really hope you don't do that because they are the ones that give you moral support and make you laugh. I think you should forget about it and just be a Twilight fan. Maybe one day you will come to like anime.|`|jkoQ9lKSaa	You don't need new friends because you differ in one thing. Friends are people who you enjoy being with and they like being with you. People who you joke around with and talk about stuff. Just don't watch anime and it will be fine. Now if the only thing your friends talk about is anime, well thats a different story.|`|fKcr6KU0aa	Wow, I feel sorry for you, since you are missing out on so much good stuff.  I mean, if you like Twilight, you might like shows/manga like "Vampire Knight."  But you'll never try them out because you're prejudiced against the whole medium.<br>  <br>  That's really sad.|`|4kuzXhAsaa	get rid of your friends because you hate anime so much?<br>  WTF ARE YOU ON.<br>  weather you do or dont like something your friends do or dont like you dont go getting rid of them!<br>  thats the most stupidest thing ive heard.<br>  maybe they should do oscars for people like you...|`|29wQe2cHaa	Why would you say people that watch should get a life? So your saying people that watch cartoons should get a life? It's the same thing as watching a movie or TV show like that 70s show.|`|gJMBiuIdaa	What?|`|vqg6wpCLaa	So, apparently Twilight is what makes people mature.<br>  Haha. You make me laugh.<br>  <br>  Twilight is poorly written, has an unoriginal plot and the characters have absolutely no depth. What is so amazingly mature about that so-called terrifically made novel which is so awesomely great? I hope you note the overusage of adjectives. It relates well to the Twilight series. <br>  <br>  Anime and manga on the other hand, are far more mature than Twilight. How much anime have you actually watched? Probably next to none, right? Now if you actually took the time to sit down and watch a good anime or read a nice manga, you would realize how great they really can be. I'm not saying that all anime and manga is good - there are some really bad ones. For example, though, Elfen Lied is a great anime and manga. It's gory, gruesome, somewhat romantic, has some humor, has nudity, mention of rape, etc. Most of all though, it has an original storyline and it is incredibly emotional. It attracts a large audience because of just the story. Even those who hate gore watch it. Now, do you really think those who watch a show like that need to grow up? I don't. Seriously, if they can sit through it all, they are already mature enough. <br>  <br>  Anime is not just cartoons. Some cartoons are also made for a more mature audience, though also being rather immature (e.g. Family Guy, South Park). I can assure you that the majority of anime is not like this. <br>  <br>  If you have watched anime previously, you have probably only seen shows like Pokémon or Digimon. Indeed they are anime, but they are also for a younger audience. <br>  <br>  So, before you bash anime and its fans, why don't you check out a good one? Maybe then your opinion would change. <br>  <br>  Also, just because you don't like anime and your friends do, does not mean you should ditch them. Really, how low are you?|`|POXOqhOYaa	Hi Krystal. :)<br>  <br>  Apparently, your misinformed about people who watch anime or read manga, it's a common stereotype to think that a person who enjoys doing something that they like, reading manga/watching anime etc. needs to get a life. Currently I'm watching plenty of anime series to become a professional manga artist, I've entered a variety of competitions and know what I'm talking about. Of course I also do plenty of other things like hang out with my friends and go to the mall, and even babysit my cousins. Watching anime is just a hobby of mine, along with many people in the Comics and Animation section.<br>  <br>  I believe that you should love your friends, if your really their friends that is and support them no matter what they like or if their a little weird at times, that's what being a friend is all about. If your thinking about ditching your friends just because they like something tells a whole lot about you, and I believe that if you want to ditch your friends because of anything they like or do for fun, you might as well because your not the type of friend they might want.<br>  <br>  By the way, I don't know why you bring Twilight into this because Twilight is a major motion picture and not a anime or Japanese cartoon show.  <br>  <br>  I'm sorry if I sound rude or hasty, I don't mean to be and I try to be as unbiased as possible, I hope that you'll stay with your friends and have a good day, who knows...maybe your opinion will change but it's perfectly fine if it stays the same because it's your prerogative.  :)<br>  <br>  Later.<br>  <br>  Edit; Awwah, you were just pulling my leg, :)<br>  You made me go off on my evil rant for nothing then, but I must admit you really had me fooled!|`|KyOP56Xsaa	>.><br>  <br>  god, that is crap. Giving up your friends just because they like anime. <br>  Only an idiot would do that.<br>  I like anime and i still have lots of time to hang out with my friends and all that.<br>  I have grown up and have got a life. You should get a life.<br>  <br>  twilight is crappp|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Twilight fans should get a life, why? they obsess about how hot Edward is, and thats fine for a fangirl, but it gets annoying, and it is the most overrated excuse for a book.|`|cidwIuJRaa	I don't care for Twilight.Still,I'mma answer this.<br>  <br>  You can do what you like,but leaving friends b/c they love anime instyead of Twilight really sucks.<br>  <br>  People naturally have differences.|`|F60JZOU3aa	so what do you want a medal ps i think twilight is crap?

xVjAHnd4aa	One huge misconception everyone has that i hate. So let me clear this up<br>  <br>  <br>  <br>  TRANSFORMERS IS AMERICAN NOT JAPANESE. HASBRO CREATED THE TOYLINE BEFORE THE SERIES. HASBRO IS AN AMERICAN COMPANY|`|pTERJdzQaa	Yeah, Transformers was originally an Anime.<br>  But Cartoon Network attempted to Americanize the Transformers series by creating their version of the series called "Transformers Animated", and the animation of the CN version is lacking and its not that great.<br>  <br>  If youre talking about the original Transformers back in the 80's then now youre talking. And the 90's Transformer series was SWEET!!!!|`|3N2ElzcQaa	lol, yes<br>  <br>  Everyone seems to have loved it, be it anime fan or not|`|cidwIuJRaa	I hated the TF live-action film.|`|b10c5828972384201aa770b9f00357b7aa	it was originally an anime just like TMNT<br>  my opinion? lol I don't really like it *hides in corner in case someone throws something at me*<br>  it's soon to be released here and my brother is already forcing me to watch it I mean c'mon I don't like robots, the previous one was ahem let me shut my mouth >.>|`|unVzWzCuaa	i think that its oka but i dont think it could be put in the same category as anime|`|2jxWrnUGaa	Yepp it's an anime.<br>  <br>  haha! :D|`|2ogFk4Amaa	Yes, probobly the best one so far, that I have seen.

Why is she there? She said on tonight's DOI that she skated for the first time last week with her kids and I was like "Err... I thought you were meant to be some sort of professional!". Eurgh!
TmIxJNagaa	EMG's are the way to go if you wanna get that in your face type of sound.|`|ce83aaa18b48dd89e8f2ce5b7f9d7885aa	It all depends on what kind of music you want to play. Rock? Metal? Probably some kind of humbuckers. Lots of people say EMG. The issue with that is that they are active pickups. So you need a spot in the guitar for a 9 volt battery plus the wiring necessary to hook them up. Passive humbuckers are much easier to put into a guitar. But again it depends on the guitar. Is there room for them or does the body need modification?  Lots of variables. What ind of guitar? For blues?Maybe a strat with vintage noiseless. Much more info is needed to make an intelligent choice.<br>  However, if you are looking to buy a guitar, then buy it with the pickups you want installed. Makes life way easier.|`|oM7zA7Jhaa	If you are wanting to shred, and i bet you are, EMG 81!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!|`|ujYO8KYpaa	EMG...hands down
AS4pWko5aa	he rollerbladed which is basically a lot slower than ice but similar <br>  <br>  ray is amazing <br>  <br>  the judges are terrible the scores do not reflect their performances <br>  roxy was brilliant but got poor marks ,|`|0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	He is a trained dancer which the judges have said goes a long way in the competition and has been on the ice before the competition.  He is also a proficient roller skater.  I think it is totally unfair to bring someone in at his level against those who have never been on the ice before.  It is a forgone conclusion he will win which takes all the pleasure out of the competition for me and must make the others wonder why they are bothering at all.  I keep hoping he will fall flat on his face one week - him and his partner are soooooo smug!|`|aKhZNd7daa	As far as I know none - However he is an accomplished Ballroom Dancer and maybe his youth and zest for life has spurred him on for DOI - You can't take it away from him he is brill !!!|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	I do not think they would have let him go in if he had as unfair advantage he can sing and dance also use rollerblades well.<br>  I think his dancing on ice is better than his partner lol|`|FcHplZtQaa	Apparently ice skating none but he rollerblades all the time|`|vVngWHZqaa	he did rollerblading which is kinda similar to ice skating... just not on the ice lol.|`|92hLSlJcaa	None - apparently there are no ice rinks in Liverpool but he used to roller-blade, which I don't think is an advantage.|`|f1To9XHkaa	On about week 2 he said he had no experience but had to just taken to like a natural. Dont know how true that is.|`|slTF9rKUaa	He is a rollerblader and he ice-skated a few times thats it|`|HnNJAJeJaa	He used to rollerblade,and has done a bit of skating but not much...|`|7Tw7s6HSaa	None

fwWO14fIaa	if it is true what he did and he did hit her then i hope the inmates find out what he's done and give him a good beating, see how he feels. i like his music, but as for him he can rot in prison. any man who physically abuses a women isn't a man at all and deserves what he gets.|`|WyQuDaRyaa	I can't say that he had the right to beat her..because that was wrong. BUT..if it is true that she gave him herpes..then, you can't blame him for being upset. People have to think about how he must have felt when he found out about this..it's actually embarrassing for the both of them. While he shouldn't have acted out in this manner, it's kind of gross that she had Herpes in the first place. But If I like their music, I like it. Their personal lives aren't really going to stop me from being a fan.<br>  <br>  I could careless about the thumbs down either.|`|qcjAg3yOaa	Could  NOT say it better than Megan!!.. I feel the same.. I still like his music.. and because he did that doesnt mean his songs suck all of a sudden... I dont buy any of his CDs but thats how its always been.. I never bought them even before he did this.|`|xM50DXFQaa	Hell Yes!! He is still has amazing talent!! No one knows what actually happened!! Everything is "Allegedly"<br>  <br>  Too many people jump to conclusions!!  8-)<br>  <br>  xxx|`|uhQJwWGyaa	nope nope nope what he did to rihanna is horrible. i cant believe he did that. disgusting|`|MiKrWuM6aa	I never was|`|DUqzR7FWaa	nope i lost alot of respect for him|`|CNZn1qhJaa	I wasn't before, and I'm not now.|`|Y2oWOnRyaa	No, I am not, especially after what he did to Rihanna. Stars that do that kind of stuff, are messed up and really need help. I didn't really even like him that much before anyway.  But it was totally unfair of him to do that kind of stuff to Rihanna.|`|CCAXxHbeaa	ewww no?!<br>  never EVER was, never EVER will be.<br>  he's gross.<br>  whoopdeedoo! he can dance and sing.<br>  who cares?<br>  he's not even attractive. he looks like an ape.<br>  thinking about what he looks like makes me cringe. it's that bad for me.|`|RSN8qQajaa	NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO...|`|ZMiZVmkpaa	No I am not a CB fan anymore.<br>  never should a man lay a hand on a women.<br>  fxck him, I have lost all respect for him and his lost a lot of fans,|`|ze7HgH19aa	NO<br>  I never was and never  will be<br>  I am soooooooooooooo against woman beaters<br>  Did u c rihanna's beat up face on tmz?<br>  I don't give a rat's *** if she hit him first or anything else she did or said<br>  A real man doesn't beat a woman!|`|1fxLrxpnaa	I wasn't a massive fan before but I'm not even a small fan now! What he done was terrible and there is no excuse what so ever for what he done, and apparently this wasn't the first time he hit her!|`|d397dMRZaa	I never was and I never will. Don't want to support someone like that.<br>  <br>  Edit : Why the thumbs down? Its a question that requires an opinion and I gave one|`|cDNMB0GAaa	H*ll no. Never was. Never will be, wat he did just made me h8 him more|`|1dArNMebaa	HELL NOOOOOO|`|9zacWxG2aa	Yes|`|JZWzG04Gaa	sure y not? everyone loses there temper, noone aint perfect|`|faa7902e1ee0c17b5068f8bb39d73dc6aa	maybe depends on how he acts after he gets counselling|`|hBmafVYoaa	Never was. If the allegations are true, he doesn't deserve fans.|`|iwThnG3Raa	It all depends on his behaviour.|`|k39bNUgeaa	Nope never was a fan before he beat rihanna<br>  I'm still not a fan<br>  and probably never will be a fan of him|`|xnhwmontaa	No. I have lost respect for anyone who hits a women wether or not they brought it on themselves its still wrong|`|948aqx2kaa	I'm still his biggest fan. Everyone deserves a second chance.|`|q0Dg8a1haa	Never was, so my opinion of him didn't change.

vJ6GI7oIaa	She has said her last moments will not be captured on camera.<br>  <br>  As a journalist said, she is a broken toy we created that we no longer want. She has spent 6 years in the glare of the camera, and it's become second nature to her. Being filmed whilst struggling through cancer doesn't seem to affect her - she is so used to being stalked by the media, having her dirty linen washed in public. She is worried for her sons, and is being utterly selfless - although ￡3 million is already enough, she knows doing the documentary, interviews, magazine deals etc will help raise another ￡1 million for them. It's a tragic situation.|`|6L4n6CFaaa	wait, is she seriously going to have the cameras on when she is actually dying? <br>  <br>  I think its cool she's trying to secure her childrens future<br>  but personally i wold wanna spend my last days in private with my loved ones|`|VefSnu0Gaa	she is?? wow, i think that's kinda sick, i mean it's her choice afterall, but if it was i wouldn't do it, and if i was her fan i wouldn't want to watch her die anyway.-|`|aTBs7pJ4aa	i did not follow it enough.... but sounds pretty intense.. strange...<br>  goodluck to her|`|U7BkuEU9aa	I don't know who Jade Goody is, but some people just have an uncontrollable need to stay in the spotlight.

IMAGINE BEING TOLD U WERE GOING TO DIE AT THE AGE OF 27!!<br>  <br>  No one deserves to go through what she is going through.  I just think it is so sad, I really feel for her and her family.<br>  <br>  She's used to being in the limelight and everyone knowing her private life, so its normal to her.  Even if she tried to die in private without being open and up for filming and interviews etc, the paps still wouldn't leave her alone and would be forever pestering her.  At least shes doing it at her own free will.<br>  <br>  She's raising money for her 2 sons, I'm not a parent but I'm sure that would be my main priority, I wouldn't care how invading the TV interviews were etc.  I'd in a way feel guilty for leaving my children, and really the only thing that she can do for them is to ensure a comfortable future for them by supporting them financially.  It must feel awful knowing that you are not going to witness your children growing up and will not be there for them - if money is all you can give then why not?  <br>  <br>  Getting married - well most girls dream of their wedding day and with 2 months of life left whats the point in worrying about anything, just go for it.  Try and enjoy what you have left of your life as much you can and leave as little unfinished business as possible.  It celebrates her and Jack's love for one another but its also a sort of celebration of her life as the wedding has got all of the family together and given them the chance to enjoy themselves during this hard time.<br>  <br>  So many people have cancer yes and Jade is raising awareness of that.  Since her diagnosis, cervical cancer screening has gone up by 20%.  It may seem that she is making a fuss but doesn't she have the right to she is dying at the age of 27 for christs sake its terrible!  <br>  <br>  I can't even begin to imagine how it must feel to be told u are terminally ill, my heart goes out to anyone in that situation and to their families.|`|HnNJAJeJaa	Just leave her alone,she is dying,would you want to swap places with her,i think not.Show some compassion.she has made more awareness for smear tests,which is a good thing,just so sad,nothing more can be done for jade.she is leaving behind two beautiful little boys,and i for one think she is a very brave girl.she does not deserve all these nasty comments,you have your opinion,and now ive given you mine...And as for being blinded by her stupid acting,as you say,i dont think this is any sort of an act-The girl is Dying....|`|iJXFZx7taa	That's really pathetic of you.<br>  <br>  Don't talk bad about someone until you've experienced what they're experiencing.

P8gGMlbIaa	You are not going to find a best anime because fans will disagree with each other all the time. You think it's DBZ that just fine for you, but I will respectfully disagree.  I like Kajia M's answer because I personally like Zeta Gundam as well. It's not my best but it's up there, but that's just me.<br>  <br>  The only anime that fans can generally come to an agreement with is most like Miyazaki's movies, but will generally not rate them as the best.

He climbs in to help and the truck speeds off. When it stops at a near by ghetto, the big capsule of "poisonous gas" cracks open and reveals a green-haired girl. When she and Lelouch are cornrered by soliders trying to find her, she gives him th power of geass (hence the geass in Code Geass), which allows him to tell anyone to do anything, and they will do it.

His wife was on a business trip and was planning to meet him there the next day. When he reached his hotel, he decided to send his wife a quick email.<br>  <br>  Unfortunately, when typing her address, he missed one letter, and his note was directed instead to an elderly preacher's wife whose husband had passed away only the day before. When the grieving widow checked her email, she took one look at the monitor, let out a piercing scream, and fell to the floor in a dead faint.<br>  <br>  At the sound, her family rushed into the room and saw this note on the screen:<br>  <br>  "Dearest Wife, <br>   Just got checked in.

xPtvOXkHaa	I Don't Know. Ive Been Getting The Same Thing. But Here's What I Heard:<br>  <br>  First Article about Tom HAVING Herpes.<br>  <br>  Last event date, the exclusive information was sent to us by a fan of the group, that seems very well-informed.<br>  In her e-mail, she explained to us that Tom Kaulitz, had traveled on Tuesday 10 February 2009 to the Hospital in Hamburg (the Albertinen-Krankenhaus) suffering from a sharp pain the lower abdomen.<br>  According to the cousin of our investigator, who is pursuing his medical studies in Hamburg and who is an intern at the hospital, Tom might suffer genital herpes, which is a highly contagious sexual disease. According to the cousin, who has access to medical records, Tom would have an old herpes that had not been treated. The doctor would have immediately given appropriate treatment.<br>  But wait, what was his second surprise when, on the care sheet, the young patient of 19 years responded to the full name Thomas Kaulitz, is... the official name of Tom Kaulitz! The guitarist is hiding his true identity from us? But then, would Bill have another name?<br>  This information, not yet official, should be made conditional. If it were true, it would be a blow to the sexual performance of the gorgeous Tom!(this is off an artical off an web site).<br>  If he does, it's no surprise! Poor tommy!<br>  <br>  Here is another article about Tom..Und it says that a French website that its a 100% RUMOR! But Only Tom knows whats true und whats a rumor !! <br>  The story goes that on February 10th, Tom went to the hospital in Hamburg with pain in his lower stomach. After some tests, it was found that Tom didn’t have appendictis, but genital herpes. They say he’d had it for a while, and it had gone untreated, otherwise they could given him a quick treatment.<br>  This leads to the biggest question: Is it true? I think it’s safe to say that this isn’t true, and was just made up by someone who wanted to get some Tokio Hotel news back in the media. The source was cited as the cousin of the person who sent it, who is studying medicine in Hamburg.<br>  <br>  So Until we hear it from Tom's Mouth that he has Herpes...DONT BELIEVE IT!.. :) ...After all there has been multiple rumors about them..Like Bill being Gay..Und having a relationship with Andi!!!....Und That Bills Real name is WILLIAM! WTF?...Bill has said that his mom wanted it simple just BILL UND TOM! Nothing else! :) haha...Thatis why its hard to believe that Tom has Herpes...

And I wish people would stop spreading it around. And even if he did, that is HIS business. Others have no right to be spreading that kind of information around. Same goes for hospital visits. Sorry...but I just don't like it when people try to get to involved in their personal lives. Sure it's fine to be worried about and care about them, but if they want us to know something about them being in the hospital they will tell us themselves.|`|xzgFgxylaa	I have read he has herpes.<br>  I just googled it and found all this out.|`|1fhP1xgzaa	i heard that too but i think its just a rumor

wNUvIhbtaa	any computer program like reason, cubase, or garage band (which you can find already installed on macs).<br>  or even a guitar would be enough to start. or a keyboard. just to get the melody down|`|rr5uUk6jaa	If you don't mid spending money, I think Cubase is a great bit of software - audio and easily programmable midi track with loads of effects, plugins and sounds. I use it and I create some nice tunes like: <a href="http://host-a.net/jamasia/The%20Sadness%20Of%20A%20Dream.mp3" rel="nofollow">http://host-a.net/jamasia/The%20Sadness%...</a><br>  and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzzxeundtbU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzzxeundt...</a>|`|NfXeZ00jaa	I'd agree with Garageband.  Or a slightly more versatile computer program like Logic, Cubase or Ableton Live (I use the latter).  <br>  Otherwise, get yourself an instrument and a mini-disc player.  It's all you need if it's just for the love of it.
K1GYtYryaa	no, thats weird
mD7eAAoNaa	The non-believer up there can't even spell "no" correctly, dumba$$. Anyways, well generally I think the Virgo would pick a Taurus over a Libra, because Taurus can provide stability emotionally and financially. I don't think a Virgo would like a Libra's indecisiveness. However, an appealing trait a Libra has is a strong sense of what is fair, justice. Virgos really like justice.|`|de25107f3b25bf271852feb4203decd7aa	I think Virgos appreciate our over all calmness towards very difficult situations. Like either being provoked or a really dramatic situation our first instict is to stay calm. If a taurus were provoked, they would go all out and instantly try to handle the situation by their terms which includes fighting if they have to.|`|N2u9fTQVaa	omg!<br>  if you believe in all that astrology stuff, now offense, but your retarded.<br>  when your born has nothing to do with how you act/ what will happen to you, ect.

0789e50a1396d5b6b9138ceaad0e64f5aa	What she said to Roxy was disgusting and totally unprofessional because she was saying she didn't like her.  She marked a whole point lower than the other judges because Roxy 'doesn't do it for her' which is so wrong.  She even called her by the wrong name and said she watched Daniel rather than Roxy so how could she have judged Roxy's skating?  She doesn't even skate herself!  I cannot stand her and think they should replace her as a judge next year if she can't do the job properly.  I hope Robin as Head Judge has a word with her.|`|6d10196c158f49dbb02649f8773591d0aa	Total agree bang out of order and her sorry was pathetic and embarrasing to watch Roxy do not like her and can see what judge was saying she does not do it for me either but to say what she did on national television was bad.|`|FcHplZtQaa	yeah she was nasty, she made Jason look like a saint FFS!<br>  <br>  I don't like Roxy, but the way Ruthie got personal was well out of order, and all she did was undermine her own qualities as a judge!|`|eHUXcYZhaa	There was no need for it. The criticism wasn't constructive at all, just bitchy. The comment "You just don't do it for me" was stupid. She's not supposed to fancy her is she!|`|aKhZNd7daa	What Can I say But Yes !!!|`|i4bjQbPcaa	Yes she was really out of order and personal!<br>  <br>  I really like Roxie and think she has a far better personality on the ice than that Zoe (who Ruthie is nominating for saint hood it would seem).  She only apologised for calling Roxie, Zoe.  Not for being nasty.  <br>  <br>  Grr I hate it when judges are like that<br>  <br>  Edit:  She doesn't know what she is talking about.  She has no experience of ice skating.  She is a West End actress that isn't getting parts anymore|`|5ae0627320d71f72055a25e93fb7784caa	I'm not a particulalry big fan of Roxy but I agree that Ruthie went a bit oerboard with her comments.<br>  Everyone seems to think that Jason is the nasty one but I've thought all series that Ruthie actually says the meanest things to the contestants. Jason's constructive but Ruthie just picks on people.<br>  btw. is it just me or did she look really tired on last nights show?|`|a7330cac583cce81559f73f074cb6e70aa	I don't like her she is very rude and incompetent.

AA10356243	Intuition as well as someone said watching body language and analyzing comments and movements you make.<br>  <br>  A scorpio can be almost like a virgo when it comes to analyzing someone as they try to figure out everyones game including the people they care for...<br>  <br>  But usually I can get the information by intuition on subtle hints (Like without going far, you are woman who worries about smelling good for her man, your birthday is coming up, and that this scorpio has been on your mind for a few weeks)|`|JH6oCuUZaa	As a scorpio I can honestly say that nobody knows what is going on in his head.  Get use to it.|`|01d9f7d86b08b714b8ed46b41571cfdaaa	I just pay attention, usually.  If you watch anyone for long enough, and can put together little pieces, you can figure just about anyone out.  Same goes for humans in general.  People tend to lie the same way, so that's why I can tell when someone is lying, even if I don't really know them.  <br>  So I guess that part of our ability is paying attention, and our drive to know.  <br>  What the scorpio in question is thinking, that's just about impossible to know.  If he's staring, he's probably curious about something though.|`|gHxCVVqKaa	Every movement or expression you make means something deeper about you.  A lot of this has to do with intuition, but being extremely observant of human nature helps.  Certain movements and expressions mean certain things.  An experienced Scorp is extraordinarily good at picking up on subtle differences in your mannerisms that you probably don't even notice.  <br>  <br>  Most likely though, he probably likes you ;)|`|PbLuxnzdaa	I dont know if its because im a scorpio<br>  but i pick up body language and i pay close attention to peoples faces and eyes, so i can usualy tell how their feeling or thinking.<br>  <br>  i only stare at people im trying to figure out, or if i find someone attractive lol<br>  <br>  hope this helps!?|`|xEWVqdwnaa	He likes you, idk how we do it|`|ulZv4LDBaa	he probobly likes u

The way he sings, his look BUT MOST OF ALL HIS ATTITUDE. Not all gay but most gays have that kind of attitude to them that he definitely had and I don't think it was just a confident attitude either.|`|LRLu1ofNaa	I don't think that he is.|`|kH1nZrFJaa	I don't think he is.

PpzKXnlEaa	1)  Become very good friends with your metronome.  On any comfortable pitch, set the metronome at, say, 72 bpm and play 4 counts of quarter notes, 4 counts of eighth notes, 4 counts of triplets, 4 counts of 16th notes, and one whole note.  Repeat at different pitch levels. Then bump the metronome up one click and repeat until the tempo is too fast for you to be able to keep up. In future practice sessions, begin with the tempo just below as fast as you can play, and gradually increase the tempo.<br>  <br>  2) Have you tried to learn double tonguing?  Double tonguing (and triple tonguing) is a technique to increase the speed of tonguing.  Instead of using a "tee" or "dee" articulation, you alternate  "tee" and "kee."  (low brass players will use "too and koo")You can use the same exercise as above, only playing "tee, kee, tee, kee,  tee-kee, tee-kee, tee-kee etc.<br>  <br>  3)  After you are more comfortable on a single pitch, begin using the same exercises on scale passages, or even just the first 4 tones of a scale (using different scales so you don't get in a rut) so that your finger-tongue coordination is as good as your new and improved tonguing speed.<br>  <br>  By the way, the good old ancient Arban method book (the fullsize 200 page one) has some really good sections on articulation and double tonguing<br>  Hope this helps!

VyJl1bZ4aa	everyone has their own opinion. here is mine. its really long:<br>  <br>  i think they are great people. they keep getting more and more famous and they stay so grounded cuz they have such a good family base. they wear purity rings, which i think is so cool cuz they are so religious. they really and truly care about their fans. they wont go thru with a song unless, when they test it out on their fans, their fans like it first. they try to help out with charity as much as they can. they do many meet and greets cuz they wanna meet as many of their fans as possible. they are sweet and genuine guys that any girl would be lucky to have. its not fair that they are the three most beautiful guys on the planet!! they dont act like they're famous, they are just everyday brothers living out their dream. they hold their heads up high when people bag on them and truly dont care. they are amazing people and people who dont like them are truly jeaous of them. people who say they are gay have never given them a chance. <br>  <br>  i could go on forever but i think thats enough for now haha|`|duN63EkIaa	What I really think.<br>  <br>  Well. I think since they've become this huge phenomenon, they're acting like they need to prove something to everyone. It's like acting genuine isn't in their agenda anymore. Their dad pushes them to the max, over working them non stop. I think they need to get the sticks out of their as*es and learn that their imperfections is what made them what they are today. "Hold back your thoughts and live like robots. Cuz we all know what goes on." Yeah. They aren't gone yet, but pretty soon, people will get tired of them trying to be something they're just not. <br>  <br>  Will always be a fan. End of rant.|`|i6tyscumaa	i think they make a decent pop record :)<br>  i think nick jonas is gorgeous but i just don't understand what makes joe so special. i really don't think he's attractive at all!x|`|DUqzR7FWaa	i love them. i think their good singers and role models.also i love how they do alot for their fans|`|eE1txKhdaa	I dont love them, and i dont hate them.... I like some of their older songs, such as year 3000. I think its stupid how people are calling the gay, i mean, maybe they are gay, but who cares? How would that be an insult? How does that change anything? Some people just dont like them because they are overplayed, or there music doesnt deserve so many fans..... but thats ridiculous, its not their fault that most people like their music. Preferably, I dont think they are that attractive, but they have a good band and good lyrics, why shouldn't people love them? <br>  Good job Jonas Brothers :)|`|0koOhIR9aa	I think they are mildly talented, and mildly cute. But they seem like sweeties. Actually, I don't like Jo cuz of what he did to swift<br>  <br>  but really, if you passed one of them on the street and he wasn't famous, would you really think he was super hot?<br>  <br>  but Im not a hater, dont get me wrong.|`|SLnq7j5jaa	I love the Jonas Brothers.Their music is so cute. They're not gay, or fags. They're just richer than you, and you're jealous.|`|A5WbtqTTaa	they are gay and untalented. I hate all disney channel people. They are all really ugly.

TFWSmqGMaa	Demos for the new album have already been played.<br>  If you look at the Gorillaz myspace profile, it says that a new album is currently in the making.|`|aqOD8eJZaa	Damon Albarn and Jamie Hewlett stated in an interview with CBC News on 17 September 2008 that they will be doing another Gorillaz album. Hewlett says that from their work on Monkey, "we just learned more about what we do, musically and artistically. That's a great place to come at when we come to another Gorillaz album. It doesn't have to be animation and music." Hewlett also expressed annoyance at having to draw the band members again, "I'm so f#cking bored of drawing those characters. But then we had a moment where we had a new angle on it... I'm gonna adapt them." In a later interview Hewlett said, "they'll be the same characters, but a little bit older and told in a different way." An article by the Toronto Star stated that the duo hope to begin work on the album in January 2009. Albarn also said that he wants "to work with an incredibly eclectic, surprising cast of people." On 14 January 2009, Damon Albarn made an appearance as a guest DJ on BBC Radio 1, premiering demos of three new Gorillaz songs, which are entitled "Electric Shock", "Broken" and "Stylo".
gJMBiuIdaa	Do you mean professionally? Or on the internet with a Scanlation/Fansub group?
SLnq7j5jaa	Because some people don't have anything better to do than to hate on celebrities that they don't know.|`|HsgK6fNyaa	Actually, I used to LOVE Miley and now I'm beginning to hate her too. Ya know why?...THE F***EN MILEY FANS. I mean have you read oceanup.com? All the comments by Miley worshippers are bashing Selena Gomez, badly. They seem to hate Selena because Miley supposedly hates Selena for "stealing" Nick from her. This is all BULLSH*T! Is that the example Miley is teaching her fans, to hate? Miley and Selena are BOTH talented girls in their own way, and if the Miley fans can't accept that then I'm just not gonna support her anymore. <br>  <br>  Also, when those racist Miley pics leaked, her fans just said that Miley was having fun. RACISM IS NOT HAVING FUN. It's a serious issue. If her dim-witted fans can't comprehend this then this just shows Miley's terrible influence on girls.<br>  <br>  So you ask why people just started hating on Miley? Just ask yourself(if you're a hardcore Miley fan that is) or go take a look at oceanup.com. There's your answer.|`|0koOhIR9aa	I don't even know, man. She does what normal girls do. I think it's probably just jealousy and insecurity.<br>  <br>  I am not a Miley-hater, or a Miley-lover.<br>  I am kind of indifferent towards her. To me, she's just a teenage girl.|`|AA10067527	They don't.  It's just Miley's media monkeys pulling strings to get her some headlines when the babe's buzzzzz starts diing down.  Not to worry :)|`|DgalPu0Iaa	I know!! I don't. I really like her, then other people just diss her. I guess they are annoyed of hearing about her all the time and seeing Hannah Montana stuff on sale.|`|cofGih3Faa	because shes a whore that thinks shes all that and is dating a 50 year old man  and little girls look up to her while she takes naked pictures of herself|`|5KjvNg2oaa	shes hot and young and people are jealous|`|i6tyscumaa	i don't get it either. i like her :)<br>  x|`|LUIvkJodaa	i think most people dont like her because she is supposed to be a role-model for girls (and maybe some boys?) ages 5-12 and she has done some pretty whore-like things and mocked and made fun of the oriental race and selena gomez. I dont think that these are things that little kids should be exposed to. and besides she is so overrated and over advertised.|`|GGGeRx7Saa	people probably only hate her because she broke up with nick jonas and everyone is just so in love with him. also, probably because she's now dating a twenty year old. it's really stupid how people hate her now a days because your right, she didn't do anything bad.|`|eUti4I9jaa	1- Mostly because she took Nude Pictures, and they ended up on a Magazine.<br>  <br>  2- They just don't like her<br>  <br>  3- Because they think that she is jealous of Selena because of the (Nelena) thing.<br>  <br>  P.S. Personally I'm a fan of SG.<br>  <br>              -Peace<br>  Vote me as Best Answer|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	She thinks she's talented and cute, and she's not even close! She's fake. The only reason she has a career is because her rich, hillbilly daddy paid Disney millions so his inbred little girl could be in the rpotlight too. She has absolutely NO class, no talent, she rich and she can't even go see a dentist and her fans are uber-annoying. I don't hate her, I wish she'd crawl back under the rock from wence she came. The only people who like her are kids who haven't learned about GREAT music yet (BAD parenting!!!). I hope the best for those poor things. Only immature children still call people who can't stand Miley jealous. Come on, grow up already! Just because some of actually have GREAT taste in music and you don't, certainly doesn't mean we're jealous. I don't envy ANY inbred trailer trash!|`|bmwR7RdMaa	well...look at the link below and hear her sing especially at the grammies.<br>  she's a teen , a role model for kids who watch and love her and its her duty to maintain that image she created. i have nothing against her except the way she behaves even though she's 16  and behaves like an idiot taking semi naked or naked pics of herself<br>  <a href="http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=miley%20cyrus%20dirty%20pics&um=1&ie=UTF-8&sa=N&tab=wi" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com/images?hl=en&q=...</a>|`|z5Hl6Bhtaa	Hmm That's a tough one..Maybe it's because she's supposed to be all about god and a child's idol when she's taking racist and Provocative photos. Or maybe it's because she's a little brat who only cares about the money in the little disney bubble gum cooperation. She did do something very bad and people dislike her for her actions and I am one of them. Chris also did something bad but that's something completely different and totally irrelevant to Miley Cyrus.|`|977dfce09b341a8f080ed1e8be1aef27aa	people have their own reasons and i have my<br>  <br>  - she is expected to be a BILLION AIR: when in my opinion she does not deserve it because she can't sing, dance or act<br>  <br>  - Chris Brown did a wrong thing i understand that but Miley did many wrong things. she keeps apologizing for ALL her leaked pictures saying she will never do it again - but she keeps doing it and keeps apologizing , she never learns her lesson<br>  ** But i do admit it Chris Brown's drama is worse. the only reason people don't hate him as much is because LITTLE girls don't look up to him. Miley has a fan base made up of little girls, they look up to her and she is acting like a slut.<br>  <br>  And when i see her on t.v to me it looks like she thinks she's all that - when she is NOT.<br>  <br>  *************************** Just the most annoying thing about her is her attitude, she acts like she is on top of the world, that everyone loves her when most people would rather slice her up.|`|af644b7256e7bf5a53974bb99a32d482aa	Most of them are teen girls, and it's because they are INSANELY jealous over her fame & money. It's pathetic, especially since many of them also deny that Chris Brown did anything wrong.<br>  He should be thrown in jail and lose all his fans.

Y8rB9iuHaa	British, but more evidently... American culture is hugely influential in Japan and has been since 1945.<br>  <br>  Japan has developed little home grown popular culture and western music is endemic there.  The Beatles are still enormously popular almost everywhere but Britain!<br>  <br>  Because we Britons share a common language with the US, it does not sound odd if we make reference to an American city such as Chicago in a song.  Since Britain and America have dominated popular music, other cultures sometimes include western 'references' for effect.<br>  <br>  For balance... we in Britain have long had 'references' to French culture in cooking and restaurants because of the French talent and history in those areas.|`|G658OZ4waa	Its actually ALL japanese songs and I was wondering that too lol,but i actually don't know|`|2VbuQDqXaa	<a href="http://niceblogg.chickenkiller.com" rel="nofollow">http://niceblogg.chickenkiller.com</a> <br>  A very informative website you can also get much information in website

9rEOY77raa	there is always an abundance of great guitar players, so like you said, playing the bass gives you more options when you're trying to find a band. there is usually a lack of good drummers too.

Guitar is just awesome and you get the spotlight a lot in your band. Drums get you more rhythmically in tune with music. And bass is really fun to play and mess around with. I play all three but, i think you should go with guitar at 13 years of age. You will get better if you practice and maybe hit the big time =). Also You Will! Go deaf if you play drums your whole life haha I'm already half deaf in one ear because of it but it was totally worth it.<br>  Or just go with what you enjoy the most thats probably what i would do then branch out into all three =)|`|2xo8O31Taa	Go for the bass, if you suck, it doesn't really matter because in most bands the bass does ****.<br>  If you want to be good, it will be hard as **** whatever you choose but if you are going to play badly, the bass would be the least noticeable instrument to **** up on.  You'll have to get through a lot of frustration on any instrument before you are good.|`|WfUMOPyhaa	Bass! you will fall in love|`|nkCBUg6Yaa	I would go for the guitar, maybe that's just my love for guys who play the guitar talking.

xOZDiEYfaa	Vegas all the way!!|`|6064bd72a9d33a8f2e618cc79b0f9629aa	Vegas is the best because it's better written, better directed, better acted, everything.<br>  <br>  Then Miami because of it's pure, mindless entertainment value.<br>  <br>  And I'm putting NY last because I've never seen a full episode.|`|Um8osMNuaa	Vegas, the original and best, although when Grissom leaves l may change my mind!|`|c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	I like Vegas (although, technically it's name is "CSI:Crime Scene Investigation," not "CSI: Las Vegas".  since it was first, they did not put the city name in the title. I only say this since one of the other posters seemed a little confused). <br>  After that  I like CSI:New York. I just can't stand David Caruso in Miami, so I never watch it.|`|MlCWsBcwaa	CSI New York I think - New York is an interesting city, the cast and characters are great (especially Gary Sinise - Mac Taylor) and the stories about the cases and characters are good too.|`|A03NJA26aa	Vegas because it is the original and I love the cast and characters. Miami is 2nd and New York third.|`|ftYnOMzEaa	Miami<br>  They are more intresting to me.|`|cr5TQgmUaa	1. Vegas   2. New York   3. Miami<br>  <br>  But I agree as a procedural, NCIS is the best.|`|EQV1d5Jraa	New York's the best, followed by Miami, then Vegas :)|`|1WnALxdsaa	Miami, New York, Vegas :)|`|b3S2FImdaa	Vegas!, Miami then New York|`|17103f1748af3e37b30568fa758fd4d3aa	Miami then Vegas, last is New York|`|gjLmhE8Maa	vegas....

Always the best.<br>  Grissom cant be beaten. <br>  The other casts seem to be replicas of the vegas team.<br>  I watch them all, dont get me wrong.<br>  Just my opinion.|`|8ac644a2f32fd75e9b66e04f4285d8b5aa	I always liked Vegas.Never liked Miami, Kane was too posey and seemed only to speak in one liners.<br>  New york is growing on me though. Getting into it now|`|8rrHJ6dwaa	i like the normal CSI,<br>  but out of those 3 i think<br>  1. New York<br>  2. Miami<br>  3.

It is very sad to see a young mother of two dying having had cancer tests done in 2004 and 2006 and getting the all clear again last year. I hope she gets as long as possible with her two young sons and that she has some happy moments with them. I wish her well.

sMa56Y0Laa	I know everyone is picking Beat Freakz for who they want to win, but I've been with Quest since the beginning and I'm still by their side. They've both done incredibly throughout this season. If Fly Khicks end up being in the top 2 (I've wanted them gone since the beginning), I'll scream. But yeah, back to the real top 2. Beat Freakz have shown that girls can kill any dance (popping, locking, b-boying, etc) and are really good. Quest is also a really good crew that keeps me entertained with both their dancing and their personalities (especially Dominic ;). But it doesn't matter who wins, they both deserve it (although I'm still rooting for Quest). It's going to be reallyyy close, though...|`|7lZnHiYZaa	beat freaksss!

frqfB0usaa	-.- That's a stereotypical Pov<br>  People that watch anime are just like everyone else. And they vary. Not everyone in the world are nice are they? Not everyone in the world are mean? It varies on what type of personality they have and not what they 'watch'<br>  =3<br>  I watch anime... Does that make me mean T_T<br>  Awww *Cries in emo corner* =3 Just kidding. I will admit.. Im a little weird ?_?|`|P8gGMlbIaa	We can be nice and we can be mean, it depends on how we are treated and received.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't know about the aggressiveness on Xbox live, don't have one.|`|Okb2aQngaa	Actually, it depends on the person and what anime they like lol.<br>  If they usually like shonen anime i guess they would be aggressive because thats what shonen anime usually is. If they like shojo anime then usually they arent all aggressive such as myself [:<br>  but i guess in the end it depends on how the person really is, they could like shonen anime and be the nicest person ever, or they could like shojo anime and be the meanese person ever. It's just their attitude or how they were raised up [: i hope i helped you out.|`|JL17d1BIaa	Haha, well, I'm a Gigantic anime geek myself, and well.. geez I sure hope I'm not mean. XD<br>  First of all, it's not about what the person likes, it's the person. I've met anime fans of all sorts, ranging from kind, polite, shy, rude, angry, and just plain STRANGE.<br>  Anime, for some reason, is linked to an emo or goth style, and people outside of the otaku, emo, or gothic loop quite often frown upon styles such as that, so I think that the thought of anime fans being mean or angry, is just the product of steryotyping...|`|36hPlvRQaa	like with everything there's absolutely full variety of ppl between anime fans, we are not specific specie with same traits, same skin color and same character or else, there can be silent and there can be loud ppl, tall or short ppl, white or black ppl or completely other type ppl, well actually anime fan could be anyone, even some gramps x]<br>  <br>  ..unfortunately there's such thing as fangirls too and often u can identify them as  jerks who are screaming and acting idiotically over any dude who they find cute, i think they are making other anime fans look bad, well at least girls, but it's not like all girls that are anime fans are like that -_-|`|JBLqloRpaa	it depends on the type of anime people watch. For example, my friend likes Ouran High school host club (a very funny anime) and i've noticed that she's trying to act like Honey senpai (a really cute character) she's doing a pretty good job, so funny to watch! XD|`|pM5Dp8Wgaa	Actually we are nice, but we're really obsessive you see. When someone makes fun of a anime or anime character we kinda debate till they shut up. But it really depends on a persons personality. If you watch anime too they tend to tone down and rant about their favorite anime with you instead. We also have alot of energy and determination depending on how much it means to us. Especially the Naruto and Bleach ones.

FrzCscBlaa	its not that they don't like each other its that they both in some sense enjoy each others company because both characters are monsters of destruction and know that each and every time they fight they get pushed to their limits.  hulk and wolverine both have incredible healing factors that lets them give away and taking anything the other throws at them.  in the hulk vs movie it was really disappointing to see them both get tranqd while in the middle of their brawl...booo, but was still fun to watch|`|gJMBiuIdaa	Actually, if you watched the movie, you'd see that their fight is nothing personal. Hulk wanted to be left alone, Wolverine had a job to do. And since then, it's become almost a rivalry(based on the WWH fight).

Your dream is one of my greatest dreams, too. Don S.'s answer won't work either, unless you are content with meeting only Martin and Andy. Dave does not party with the band anymore, after getting sober back in the late 90s. Radio stations have offered meet and greets during past tours, but people often report them as disappointing and too formal, and you have to be picked from about a million contestants. Nonetheless, I'd frequently check the websites of major U.S. rock radio stations who play Depeche tunes and join their VIP lists to get mailings on special events and offers. Keep your eyes peeled for a record signing, too...maybe they will hold one when the new album is released. Otherwise, you're at the mercy of fate...gotta be in the right place at the right time to encounter them in public.

Take Evangeline Lilly for example. Look at Brad Pitt, he's not high on himself, he seems like a great guy. What you said is a generalization, and it takes a lot of talent to act, and the actors deserve to be recognized for their work, do they not? They are our entertainment. Without them, we would be bored sh*tless, would we not? <br>  <br>  The Oscars are a way for us to recognize the work people put into making entertainment for us, and it's not all about the actors. There is Best Director, Best Sound, Best Wardrobe, etc. <br>  <br>  Now, some actors are arrogant, but a lot of them aren't. <br>  Who exactly do you think is arrogant. And I'm not talking about the talentless people like Paris Hilton, or Lindsay Lohan. I'm talking about real actors.|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I'm not a huge fan of award shows myself.

QdiLYAzSaa	Wow...I actually never even considered that before, but you are completely right!  I mean seriously, if Rihanna DID start the fight, they would think of some reason for why she shouldn't be punished!!  And I don't even know if this will make sense to anyone, but I think that some of these people are being sexist towards women (in general)!  Because, have you noticed that certain people are still really sexist (like, women can't play sports as well, ect.)?  So even if they DID find out that Rihanna hit him first or something, they would probably say something like, "Well, she's just a woman...it probably didn't even hurt him.  So he had NO right to hit her back...".  You know?  It's almost as if they think that women can't fend for themselves!!  Well, we CAN...so they should stop feeling "sorry" for women (or whatever it is they're doing) and just punish everyone EQUALLY!  It's not as if women can't handle the punishment...puh-leeze!  :||`|0koOhIR9aa	Well, in the past sexism has been a major issue. You know, many years ago when woman were treated like ****. They were meant to be kept at home, barefoot, pregnant and work as a cook and a babysitter and a maid. We have only recently (relatively) had equality between the sexes. In some countries, men are allowed to beat and rape woman without consequence. There was tthis story I heard, and I forget the girls name, but it is an amazing story ( its true). In it, there is a girl (I think a young one, about 23) and she has a younger cousin. Her uncles came into their home and were trying to rape them. The older one was able to fight away, and saved her cousin by stabbing one of the uncles. And you know what? Because she saved her cousin and herself from being raped, she was sentenced to death. But anyways, this other girl from a different country heard about this and, with a petition was able to stop it. <br>  This is wrong. Also, I think the fact that men are larger comes into play. They can easily take advantage of a woman. You don't see women beating up or raping men, do you?<br>  <br>  Ok, this is my answer. I don't care if you pick me as best answer, I just wanted to state my opinion. As for Chris Brown, I think he deserves to be punished, but not too severely. I do not think that Rihanna should ever go back to him, though. Never. He should be punished, but he shouldn't have his career ended.<br>  <br>  Thanks.<br>  <br>  Ok, I want to add something. I think that people say Never Hit A Woman, because woman are more helpless to fight back. Men are larger and stronger, so if a woman hit a man, what do you think would happen? She would probably get one shot in, which is why people do not say Never Hit A Man.<br>  <br>  <br>  Poeple say Never Hit A Woman because of the issues in the past. Hitting men isn't ok either, but because of the size and the past I guess people see it differently.|`|BpRbWoFCaa	i totally agree with you. i think that violence against each other is wrong in general. doesn't matter if your man or women. that also goes along with how when a woman takes revenge against a man during a breakup, shes just venting. but if a man does the same thing than hes being abusive! that is ridiculous! either way the person is at fault if a women started it than she is to blame and should get the same consequences that a man should get.<br>  <br>  i feel sorry for Chris for being put in the spotlight so much about this just cause he is a guy, i agree if it was Rhianna then we would come up with an excuse. i think hes at fault but we don't know all the details yet to completely blame him!|`|xM50DXFQaa	I agree with you 100%!!<br>  I have heard hundreds of people say that he deserves to have his career short lived. Firstly, no one knows what Actually Happened!! Secondly, he never done anything to hurt any individual (that is bad-mouthing him).<br>  <br>  Everyone says that a man cant "hit" a woman...but you never hear the saying, a woman cant "Hit" a man?!?! It is completely unfair!! A woman abusing a man should be treated the same as a Man abusing a woman!!<br>  <br>  Everything in the news papers, magazine etc. are all "Allegedly" But people still seem to be a jumping to conclusions. <br>  <br>  I have read on different answers that people who went to his concert only weeks ago, are completely forgetting about him...throwing out his CDs etc. I don't see why?? Even if he did do this, he is still a brilliant singer, actor and entertainer....not to mention gorgeous!!!  8-)<br>  <br>  Whatever happens, I will still be a hugh fan of him!!( His true fans will stick by him) We will just have to wait until March 5th to see what the courts decide!!<br>  <br>  At least im not the only one on this thing that isn't jumping to conclusions!!<br>  <br>  xxxxx|`|1Cnaphybaa	i personally think it is sexist that people say 'never hit a girl' but they don't ever say 'never hit a boy'. i just think hitting anybody is a bad thing.<br>  i don't approve of what chris brown (or any other guy ) did , but neither would i approve of rihanna (or some other girl) beating a man.the truth is though , is that our world still remains sexist.no matter what.i definitely think that if rihanna beat chris brown , then nobody would care that much.it would not be the main story of today's gossip magazines.

aa9fa110a20e70922d00a7a8b77dd863aa	well depends on the show..<br>  <br>  negima (manga), i have, but haven't read yet...<br>  <br>  negima! is kind of like the manga, but it's not as heavy on fanservice...  it's about negi's akward almost romances with the various girls.. at the very end there is the plot involving the girl and the issue with her birthday (no spoilers)...  the ending is completely different from the manga.. since they needed a way to end it without having a source (since the manga is ongoing)<br>  <br>  negima!? takes a very loose translation of the manga and it's pretty much action packed with lots of magic and fighting.. the first 3 eps are from the manga... but after that it kind of goes off on it's own..<br>  <br>  one piece.. you get the one piece to become the pirate king.  and i can't remember what exactly that means, but at almost 400 episodes i don't really think it matters anyways :P

yJMZROABaa	There is an old jazz song "A Song Was Born." Louis Armstrong made it famous around 1948. (I'm not sure if he wrote it.) It has that lyric in it.. however, if you listen to this song, you'll hear from the lyrics like it might be sampling from another previous song to talk about how jazz was born, so there may be another song previous to this one that is the original your grandfather sung... give it a listen and maybe that will be it?

0449992e5db7c419a2aed6504f012c08aa	I hope not. He's obviously a very bad man. Not to mention a coward|`|DgalPu0Iaa	I guess he will make a comeback...sort of. Maybe some people won't like him after what he did to Rihanna.|`|4cd000d6f79b5642fde7df2f56049e31aa	chris brown is gay|`|1fxLrxpnaa	If your speaking about the thing that happend between him and Rihanna well then I don't think he ever will recover from that fully. I have alot of friends who used to love him, now hate him for what he did!<br>  (please answer mine <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/index;_ylt=AnNu.KKvSLJNMZmP.p35CocmLxV.;_ylv=3?qid=20090222114938AAgIJ0M)">http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/question/ind...</a>|`|XvF38juvaa	yes he will for sure as long as he has his crazy girl fans who can't see past his looks and think he's perfect!<br>  <br>  he'll just have to work hard for the next few months i guess|`|m3y4jU6iaa	i think he will come back but not as great before.|`|CUEco2LEaa	He will probably wait a year or two. He is better off switching to acting. I don't think he will be able to regain his crown as the 00's prince of r'n'b, although the underage sex scandal did not hurt R.Kelly. Chris might want to hook up with Kirk Franklin and release a song about how he is saved, that might help. Yes, then donate the profits to a woman's charity. R.Kelly and MJ were able to bounce back after their scandals although they had been around for longer and were smart enough to write and produce music for an alternative source of income. If not, there's always the Surreal Life or a UK celebrity reality programme willing to pay him thousands to run around in a jungle or live in a house with fellow has beens!|`|EgPIOWgbaa	I don't think he'll make a comeback after what he did to Rhianna. No body wants somebody who beats some one as their idol. <br>  <br>  He may come back in a couple of years when every ones forgotten. It'll be a better time, but I think he'll still have some 'anti chris brown people' so to speak that remember it. Like all the Rhianna fans.|`|eUti4I9jaa	I don't know, many people are pissed of at him..I doubt it, but if is is a celebrity or not, he still is a regular person, and every mark that he left on Rihanna is fully visible.<br>  <br>  And I know where you can see her REAL pics, and they are horrible!<br>  <br>  Vote me as Best Answer, and I'll tell you where.<br>  <br>                       -Peace ??<br>                                            ?<br>                                           └┘|`|faa7902e1ee0c17b5068f8bb39d73dc6aa	lol good question.<br>  <br>  chris brown was one of my all time favorite r&b singers...(u shud c my room) i have a bunch of posters but after what he did i dont think he will ever become as famous as he use to be! nobody likes a man who put his hands on a women but you never know maybe he will become more famous after he gets counselling|`|fN8Js8aeaa	I think he'll still be famous but people will criticize everything he does a lot more and use what he did against him|`|JivLAZH6aa	No, i hope not anways
2EE9L1Q7aa	How many girlfriends you think Chris Brown had when he's only 19 years old. smdh&lmao. And if he was abusive in past relationships, which I doubt. I'm sure TMZ would pay them plenty of cash and they wouldn't hesitate to tell how Chris brown beat them down.|`|kHY0eMVraa	Lol who knows...|`|kJ0tNA4Vaa	yea most likely<br>  to beat somebody up like that takes some serious practice|`|2m2tPK6Caa	he probably did he <br>  must of payed them so<br>  they don't say anything tho

d397dMRZaa	I feel sorry for her. Even though she's done stupid things in the past, no-one deserves to get cancer and die basically.<br>  I hope she enjoys herself while it lasts and that her boys are safe<br>  x|`|M3x0quJsaa	she makes me sick. she makes out shes the only one in this world suffering. she's not. millions of women have had and will have cervical cancer but unlike her they wont be able to afford private, they will have to suffer more on the NHS. Not once has she said anything about people getting smear tests. it's all about her and her pain and her children. they are the only ones i feel sorry for!|`|fKH7fVHPaa	obviously, but i dont think she deserves this much attention for it i mean there are pleanty of other people in the world with cancer and theyre not making such a big deal out of it. its annoying to be honest she didnt get this much press when she didnt have it. but yes i do feel bad for her ;(|`|AA12299132	It's not the years in your life, it's the life in your years that counts - and Jade has had more life than most of you ever will.  Don't feel sorry for he as I am quite sure she would not swop your humdrum long live for her short but full one.|`|E6obQSpraa	Yes i do feel sorry for her. Shes not the only one suffering with this terrible disease but then again, everyone who has this cancer isnt a z list celebrity either. Let her get on with making as much money as she can while she is here.|`|EqrpIU68aa	i never really liked her after the whole big brother thing but no one should have to go through what she has to. be strong!! I pray for those who have suffered and those who are suffering. Rip my friend 11/9/2008|`|uJNVAA3saa	I feel so sorry for her & if somebody turns around and says that they don't then that is heartless.|`|j1FCM0pqaa	ye  i feel sorry for anyone who has to go through the pain she is goin through , my heart n prayers go out to anyone suffering like this|`|sVkBdQ28aa	To Kimie<br>  No, she's not acting like she's the only one, she's making a big deal out of it because she's trying to help other people get the test. Cervical cancer tests have gone up 20% since this has happened. Imagine how many lives she's saved. If that's not a good thing I don't know what is.<br>  <br>  I think she's extraordinarily good at the moment. Everything she's doing now is for others. She's raising money for her kids with her last moments :(|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Not at all.<br>  She is a stupid woman who is worshipped by the other low life that cannot think for themselves and are told what to think by the media.<br>  <br>  Imagine how many families are going through redundancy and house repossessions and have to bear the thought of that poorly educated, racist woman getting paid ￡1m for marrying a convicted criminal.<br>  <br>  Is that an answer for you|`|qvWjKYVGaa	My heart goes after her she is brave woman fighting cancer even though she is dying she still fights on.<br>  Heaven will have a special angel<br>  Ill pray for her to have a peaceful and painless death|`|JRoaOqEIaa	Yes, especially for her children :'(|`|Lzt1eIZFaa	Yes I feel sorry for her, along with everyone else suffering the same fate.  I hope she had a wonderful day today (her wedding).<br>  <br>  I cannot imagine what she's going through and wouldn't wish what is happening to her on my worst enemy.<br>  <br>  Through her sad plight many more women are now going for smear tests, which is a good thing.  Plus there's a petition in The Sun to try and get the age lowered for smear tests in England.  So even though people complain that she's always in the papers, awareness is being raised.  <br>  <br>  So all the Jade haters, lay off and give the girl a break.|`|b8tgCAQJaa	It would frankly be inhuman not to feel sorry for someone with terminal cancer. I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy.<br>  <br>  I consider Jade Goody to be be a total nonentity as a celebrity, but I have absolutely nothing against her as a fellow human being, and I hope she gets the love and support she needs in her final days.|`|7XlxOfQaaa	I am very upset and sad for jade as someone who has been twice treated for precancerous cells, it makes more real for me the seriousmess of her illness. As well as that i dont like to even see you saying that she has done stupid things, in fact i think she has done more good than bad in her life and the only difference her mistakes were glorified by the media. which one of us have not made some stupid things in life. Her Legacy will be a positive one, more than any of her bad points. I hope that anyone that makes a bad comment about Jade gets a reason to be sorry for their hatred for others|`|fwWO14fIaa	yeah i do feel sorry for her. my mum died of breast cancer 6 years ago so i definately know what her family must be going through, but i don't think it's right that they should keep printing her story in the newspaper all the time i just feel the family and her should be left in peace to deal with this illness instead of having the press hounding her and taking pictures all the time.|`|6aKd0Kcjaa	you what.....besides it's her own fault for ignoring the signs in her pursuit for fame and money,her greed got the better of her at the end and,if she was so worried for her kids she should have stayed off these crappy pathetic reality **** tv she did and she's still doing it,no i got no sympathy for her i feel sorry for all those people who are suffering and the whole world ignores them suffering by themselves in a hospice,and i have been to one and saw my friend die from cancer and he died with dignity not this showcase of a programme|`|TDVIb4SBaa	Yes I do ,it must be dreadful to know that in say a few months you will die and what a horrible death.<br>  What sore heart she will have leaving her kiddies behind wondering despite financial security how they will be,she must really be a strong person to be carrying on as she is ,I say God bless her and her family.<br>  I do not care what others think,when humanity is gone nothing else remains|`|CL5kLE2paa	no sorry, I'm not a hypocrite so I can't do that.  I can't stand the woman and I'm not going to pretend I do just because she's ill|`|ZiC2hGm4aa	My heart goes out to anyone battling with this evil disease.

bmwR7RdMaa	Jim Carrey<br>  I love him in Liar Liar, the mask, bruce almighty|`|kHY0eMVraa	Will Ferrel!<br>  I love that guy :D|`|XOlnc8iBaa	They are all great but Will is the best as Chaz Michael Michael's in Blades of Glory. I think Carrey is good in Liar Liar, but he does go a little over the top. Will keeps it mellow and the look on his face teamed with the voice is hilarious. Strangely in real life Adam, Jim and Will are actually quite serious.|`|DgalPu0Iaa	That's tough. They are all funny. I will just say Adam Sandler cuz I like the movies "Bedtime stories" and "Click"|`|KKeLsvyGaa	Jim Carrey. His facial expressions and sarcasm crack me up! Lol XD|`|DUqzR7FWaa	i like them all but if i had to pick id pick adam sandler|`|kFHwzBG7aa	Oh man.  3 of my favorite actors.  I used to like Adam Sandler, back when he was doing They're All Gonna Laugh at You, and What the Hell Happened to Me? (audio discs), and Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison.  He's still pretty funny, but not like he used to be.  I was especially let down by Click, that movie could have been so much funnier.<br>  <br>  Jim Carrey also used to crack me up.  Pretty much every movie he did in the 90's was great, the Ace Ventura movies, The Mask, Liar Liar.  But then he started trying to get serious (Adam Sandler kind of did the same a little bit) and starred in some pretty bizarre films like Man in the Moon, Truman Show, Eternal Sunshine, etc.  Which were pretty good, but just weren't awesome.  Bruce Almighty was pretty good though.<br>  <br>  Will Ferrel, on the other hand, hasn't tried to get all serious on us (that I know of).  He's been in a lot of movies lately and they were all good.  But I like Will best on SNL.  I have both Best Of Will Ferrel SNL DVD's, and they're both just funny as hell.  Okay now that I think about it, Elf was a pretty stupid movie.  But I'm still going to have to go with Will Ferrel, because of SNL and movies like Ron Burgundy (whatever the name was) and Oldschool.|`|eE1txKhdaa	Will Ferrel is very funny, i adore him. But Adam sandler is more versatile, he can do romance (50 first dates), funny(Big Daddy), and stupid funny (Dont mess with the zohan).... sooooo its a tie between those two :)|`|b4UCzrDeaa	Will Ferrell, he seems to be just naturally hilarious. well they all are but he seems like he can turn any situation into a joke. Favorite movie is Old School.|`|xPtvOXkHaa	Jim Carrey and Adam Sandler <br>  :]|`|qAwr4yoyaa	Jim Carrey and Yes Man.

The site below has lyrics to all her songs and usually some quotes about the meanings of the songs below them.|`|nuNlV9M7aa	The link ':)' gave you is pretty good. And I would suggest getting Tales of a Librarian because her music is so diverse, and I wouldn't want you to be put off it all just because you didn't like one album. <br>  <br>  There are so many Tori songs I love, in fact I love them all! I would suggest listening to Siren, Northern Lad,The Power of Orange Knickers, Cooling, Precious Things and Caught A Lite Sneeze. They've all got quite a different vibe about them, so if you like any one in particular, get the album it came from<br>  <br>  Here's other people's interpretation of what her lyrics are about: <a href="http://www.songmeanings.net/artist/view/songs/49/" rel="nofollow">http://www.songmeanings.net/artist/view/...</a>

kFHwzBG7aa	I think there was plenty of time to make a 4th before his Parkinson's set in.  I didn't really like the 3rd one that much, but I think that's probably because of the setting.  Most film franchises don't go beyond 3, though.<br>  I really liked those movies when I was a kid.  They seem a bit silly now (as do the old Indiana Jones movies) but they are classics and I'll always like them.  One of the best things about back to the future is all the memorable characters.  I liked part 2 as a kid but it's kind of funny because it was supposed to take place in 2015 and that's like, 6 years away and we still don't have hoverboards!

Many guitar afficianados choose to ignorantly discredit the playing of Kurt Cobain due to his lack of virtuosity. However, I think guitar playing had pretty much reached it's peak beforehand, and it was his post punk aptitude for pop music that deconstructed the entire rock and roll genre and forced it, in a way, to start over from scratch. In that way, Cobain can be given credit for every major signed band in the last 18 years, and it was his template that created modern alternative music. Without him, everything would be different.|`|00b644b30c5fa40d9099dfddcd2118c3aa	I think that in prog rock King Crimson doesn't get the amount of mentions that they should.

c93ea3c8cf1c3dd9a0e3b461289096d9aa	Genetics are tricky, simply put, dwarfism is caused by recessive genes, you have to have two of the same recessive genes in order for that trait to be expressed (as it is in Zack's case) the other kids probably all carry the gene for dwarfism, but they each only got one recessive gene, instead of two, so it was not expressed.<br>  After all, I think, both Amy and Matt's parents were all normal height, they just all happened to have the recessive gene, which passed on to their children.|`|easm1TkYaa	Yeah it has something to do with dominant and recessive genes. The parents must have recessive genes for dwarfism, which means that it's more likely that the kids will be normal height. <br>  Best answer? :-)|`|kKmuFi4zaa	Actually, dwarfs are more likely to have children who aren't dwarfs.

He has his own type of flow and swagger in songs that no one can say anything about. <br>  Ludacris has  like I said lyrical content. His Theater Of The Mind album passed all those mainstream singles is a pretty good album. He is one of those rappers who stay true to the game. Last of a dying Breed, Undisputed, etc all great songs.

Ask him what his favorite color is and he gives you a paragraph, no joke.<br>  <br>  Overly critical, judgmental, think their crap is made out of gold and extremely close minded. Seriously, STFU. YOU'RE BORING.<br>  <br>  Yes, most people are hypocritical and contradicting, but Virgos are that times ten.<br>  <br>  Oh, and Geminis. Too boisterous for me.

We've known each other for...8 years and he hasn't gotten anywhere. Oh and did I mention I'm not even into guys? Yea, he won't get it. I just want to be his friend but he says "I love you" and bombards me with that crap constantly.<br>  <br>  Another is a Leo. Well, I didn't like her at first. But we've kind of grown on each other a little. I don't like how she's a huge attention seeker though.<br>  <br>  Another is a Virgo. He's soooo melodramatic and woe is me. Ugh. I won't even go there. I just can't have a conversation with him without the subject going from something totally unemotional to him complaining about his troubles and practically crying.<br>  <br>  (I'm a Taurus/Cancer rising) So go figure why I didn't like the leo much at first. The cancer is a bit annoying and we argue a bit. I wish I could plant a seed in the virgo's back to get them to grow a back bone.|`|2a7JkJEraa	I find Libras annoying...they are super flaky and sometimes completely forget about you.

They like to talk themselves up looking for praise. Whatever they do, they make it sound like it was so hard and that they are the only ones who could have done it. So freakin full of themselves. The ratio of listening and talking is not equal when you are in conversation with an Aires. And when you do respond to a question an Aires asks you, they just cut you off and start talking about themselves again. It like, why ask me a question in the first place if you were just gonna continue talking about yourself again? <br>  <br>  -Virgo|`|d9hzMrzwaa	my aunt she's a gemini. she's likes to give me lots of presents but, shes mean to me most of the time.<br>  <br>  im a pisces|`|8ZUVToXgaa	I don't really know a most annoying person, HOWEVER.

Her hygiene is horrible. She picks stuff off of her face, looks at it, and then flicks it. Her hair has big flakes of whatever it is in it. She doesn't wear deodorant and swears up and down she's the best at everything. She brags about trivial things that no one cares about. She lies compulsively and the lies are so outrageous that a stranger could even tell it's not the truth. Plus, she walks with a strut at the same time she's carrying her tin lunchbox full of dragonballz collector cards. The girl is 26 by the way. I don't think all Libras are this way of course but this one gives you guys a bad name.|`|edJtHlDiaa	I had a gemini friend that i used to talk to who just was not a very nice person he was always rude to me,and spiteful for no reason i think it was cause he liked me more than a friend but i just liked him like a friend,and like now that i have someone i thought like when i told him about it he would be happy for me but no he's like really mad and i just can't be friends with him no more.|`|4UeOIGuhaa	Hmm, its a tie between my Cancer brother and Leo brother.<br>  <br>  My Cancer brother is a snitch, he is fricken 10+ years older then me and he stilll cant get on with his life, but piss me off with his life...

He can be cool at times but he thinks he is on top of the world and says stuff like hes so much cooler then me or whatever. He needs to stop acting so hard as well. <br>  <br>  There are more things to this but I just dont have time to put it all done ;]<br>  <br>  But then there is also my Libra father, he is not really annoying but he gets on my nerves A LOT.

The theme of the song is centered around the main character who, while under the influence of MDMA and the psychedelic drug DMT, is abducted by extra-dimensional aliens. The aliens give the man a message for all of mankind but he is unable to remember or understand his experience.

cUjcn2lsaa	I've been wondering that too. They're overrated, mediocre, and unoriginal. What can I say? They're not rock, they're adult alternative (which is super-toned-down rock/pop music)<br>  <br>  They are the perfect example for a manufactured, corporate 'rock' band.<br>  <br>  Matt K: I own an iPod and use iTunes, but I'm not 'brainwashed' by Apple to buy songs from the band. You can't assume that EVERYONE who uses their products is brainwashed. lol|`|Yc9uPziVaa	because the media likes them <br>  <br>  :P|`|C7YbYUYPaa	Gwyneth Paltrow|`|Z5VCTFruaa	they're not so bad...<br>  and they are rock/pop. they have nice melodies|`|2bVxBCgzaa	because of the song 'Yellow'. Just shows that all it takes is one hit. I don't see the appeal of them- I find them very dull and corporate sounding, like the entire album is one long iPod commercial or something. I can hear them consciously ripping off mid-period U2 in a big way- but that's partly Eno's fault. There's just no power, no energy, to them- crank the guitars, boys; this is rock and roll!|`|LwqM7EHVaa	I understand that a lot of people hate them, but I have to admit I like their older music, every song in A Rush Of Blood To The Head and Parachutes is amazing, especially Spies.. <br>  <br>  I know I'm getting a lot of TD's, but that's just my opinion.. =)|`|SFhITXHMaa	They're famous because their record company pays radio stations to play their crappy music and the brain-washed masses eat it up because decades of corporate media have obliterated their ability to distinguish art from bullshit.|`|IMCYeBuQaa	idk either but i think their song viva la vida really made them their cearer|`|kC3VwbfRaa	hype. so "if you dont get it, it means you are a just a simpleton who doesnt know what real music is"|`|k7jGZydJaa	Because people like their music.<br>  Who cares if they're rock or not?|`|wTkvkWscaa	Because some people like their music...|`|OrAk4Fpoaa	i don′t get it either.....I mean, they suck!!! and they are defenetly not rock|`|883997fad881ac64eae0f38b785bef3daa	Obviously Apple Inc, loves them, which means all their brainwashed customers love them too.

dM1jwSGyaa	I think Taylor Swift started performing when she was like 10 or 12, so it's okay. Not many people will take you seriously though, and prepare yourself for rejection.<br>  <br>  First form a band. Get your friends who are decent at playing instruments, or learn yourself.<br>  <br>  You can cover songs by other bands that you like. You don't necessarily have to write your own, especially at your age - you haven't really experienced stuff. No offense.<br>  <br>  Then just send in demos to record labels and such, or perform around town until you become semi known. I doubt that at your age you will be the new hit sensation, but when you keep on practicing and getting better, you never know what will happen once you hit 17 or 19.
IOQ0zIFlaa	Dairy is a hugeeee no before a performance.  If you have nothing going on though, you could still have it.<br>  <br>  Before and during a performance, tea with honey or lemon, just honey, warm water; those are all good.  DON'T drink cold water though.  It puts a lot of strain on your vocal chords and enormous shock on them.  Cold anything of bad for your voice before anything.  Throat Coat is a lifesaver if you're sick or lost your voice.  It helps you regain power.<br>  Pineapple juice is also good to drink.<br>  <br>  And believe or not, Gummy Bears are good to have.  They get rid of phlegm and protect the throat.  I wouldn't recommend too many because sugar is bad, but they help.<br>  <br>  Exercise wise:  work on your stomach muscles.  And when you are exercising, make sure you're still breathing A LOT and not raising your shoulders when you breath.  It'll help you be able to hold more air and control breathing.<br>  <br>  Enhancing range:  sing everyyyy day (unless you're really sick).  You haveee to make your vocal chords strong and that means singing every day.  You don't necessarily have to sing a bunch of songs, but DEFINITELY warm up your voice with some scales, tongue roles, lip roles, sighs, etc.  And go all the way up and all the way down your range when you warm up.|`|qXjw8acUaa	take this the right way...you either have it or you don't..Don't take that as me saying you DON'T because obviously I've never heard you sing...but what I used to do before I was really good was I would actually pick songs that I loved and listen to them over and over and try to sound exactly like the people who was singing the songs and before too long I had it! Then once I got to that point where I could mimick anyone I wanted, I could then "own" my voice and change it up to the style I wanted and then not sound like a cover artist|`|Q5GKWChoaa	Well, I'm a bass singer. <br>  <br>  To warn up, I have a sequence of song clips that help guide me through my warm-up. I start on a G2 - E2 - D2 - C2 - Bb1 - A1. Then I start it over again about 3 times, then I move on to a different set of clips C2 - B1 - A1 - G#1 - G1 - F#1 - F1 - E1 - Eb1 - D1. Which is as low as I can usually go, though sometimes I can hit a C1. And I repeat to ensure that I'll be able to hit any note required of me.<br>  <br>  Dairy is definately a no before performances because it causes mucus to build up around the vocal chords. I drink a peppermint or spearmint tea with a bit of honey before and after I warm up.<br>  <br>  Sorry if I'm not much help.|`|1UUfKmuZaa	well... i usually drink water... lots of it... and i sing songs below my range, in my range, and way out of my range before i sing so i know i can hit the notes i have to.|`|xnxrpKAqaa	i allways have a teaspoon of honey before preforming because it smooths your throat. i also every day try and hit the highest note possible.|`|AA12063594	Drink loads of warm hot water<br>  Honey througout the day<br>  Rest before a big performance<br>  Workout with cardio and situps(Stomach muscles and stamina on stage)<br>  <br>  Begin workout with humming scales and work up to vowels. Increase volume as I go throughout warmup.
f5UmSdoMaa	One day, in the far future, it's likely that it will happen as a lot of Fort Minor because a lot of the songs originate from Linkin Park songs that weren't appropriate for Linkin Park's "purpose" for lack of a better word.  Right now, however, he doesn't have any plans in the near future. <br>  <br>  Fort Minor technically can't disband because it is made up a grand total of one member (S.O.B. are guests). Unless Mike Shinoda learned to reproduce by dividing himself in half....|`|DUwhR7iyaa	yeah i hope so remember the name is pretty cool of a tune|`|hFnSEAGjaa	I think fort minor disbanded because the rapper from linkin park created fort minor for the 3 years that linkin park stopped making new songs.  But a new LP album came out in 2007 and a newer one is coming out in 2009 and lets hope that the 09 album is similar to fort minor|`|5MbXjS1Iaa	I like them too, <br>  and I really don't think they ever will.

As for the cards Russian roulette, who stays and who leaves.and yes it was murder because two people knew what cards they held in advance.and anyone else it the room could have removed any evidence of foul play. leaving only a dead body a table three chairs,three cards ,and two hooks, as the hooks could have been attached to the vehicle to hold anything even a swaybar. you never said they were important just that they were there, like the table and chairs. now it could be a sub, in which case the body died from radation because if a sub sinks it would reach crush depth long before air tanks would be needed. And I doubt; that there are any truely square rooms on a sub. Because; of its basic hull design. which means they were drawing cards to see who stayed in the radation room. And Radation is a form of poison.|`|TZ2gqaLYaa	my guess is that he starve or got dehydrogenated. The guy probably was locked in and was so bored that decided to play cards to pass time and to not be bored. The hooks could probably be to hang a coat or to make the person think they caused the death, and because there is no windows there was probably no exit and he probably started getting hot and breath hard because it was stuffy.So maybe he had a slow and painful death.how unfortunate.|`|oNcOgxhHaa	I have never been good at riddles, but maybe he suffocated because there were no windows?|`|36ZKn2bMaa	he obvioulsy swallowed the hook.|`|ASE8nvRNaa	you should ask your friend for the answer|`|RFGXQ5C5aa	wuz he on the moon with no oxygen?

gJhwH335aa	One Piece because they are long, fun to watch and less dragging and consistent. Making it re-readable and re-watchable over and over again because you can at least spot some hint about the next plot / arc when doing so. I don't want to read / watch a short anime series over and over again with predictable storyline. It will bored me to death sooner or later. Speaking of which, I was bored a while ago so I decided to find a hidden Pandaman based on Oda's clue. I think I manage to find five hidden Pandaman on one tankobon.

Ow3O7h4caa	Moon transiting in Aquarius gives one the opportunity to come more in touch with groups of persons, associations, with many friends or acquaintances. Your hopes and wishes will increase during this period and you will find yourself more refined and artistically inclined, also in possession of humanitarian ideas, tending to greatly improve your general surroundings and conditions.<br>  Concentration is good at this time and gives you a chance to do some deep thinking.<br>  <br>  This is a good position for the Moon as it gives the ability to study human nature , the personality becoming now, more anxious to gain a knowledge of humanity than at any other time in one's life. You will have opportunities to refine your lower nature and obtain mroe control over the mind.<br>  <br>  Note that the aspects received by other planets and the HOUSE where the transit takes place will show the area where this transits will have the most benefit.<br>  <br>  Note that if you have Sun/Moon in Aquarius, then their will be a conjunction at one point. If it conjuncts the Sun, it will indicate very important changes about to take place, preceded by a period of uncertainty and indecision. Note that this position is mainly dependent upon other aspects to give it character and definite shape, and while if often gives the desire for change, it does not always bringthe opportunity to carry out that desire.<br>  If it conjuncts the Sun, it will have an effect upon the other lunar aspects, as it strenghtens the Moon's aspects to the other portions of the chart, and brings individual effort into play either to change or to imporive the environment.<br>  In some case, it has a weak influence, according to the influence and power of the Sun both in nativity and on the transit.|`|e14b1125c91fafed4795c69469f8b509aa	The moon is in Aquarius?

wvgXjB3Vaa	i have a long distance relationship as well as you do but even farther away like across the Atlantic<br>  there are many good things that a long distance relationship can give you as well as many bad things<br>  first a bad thing is that either one of the two can cheat on the other and he or she doesn't know. a good thing is that if the relationship lasts for like eight months it is a true relationship.<br>  i have read your previous questions even though i was late for them and could not answer them i think that even though he had already seen you through web cams u were possibly different that what he imagined in person so he is trying to keep some distance and probably making up his mind of either stay with you or break up. if he was that romantic before seeing you and now doesn't even pick up the phone he probably ashamed of you. i know i wouldn't because if i haven't said this before you are beautiful just plain beautiful nothing else. i have had this same thing u had but with a shorter distance relationship. the girl i started to go out with was extremely short than i expected. i am 5.9 and she is 4.10 which i didn't expect at all. now at first i was ashamed and only hung out with her at private places. she noticed it and talked with me. fortunately she understood what i expected and said that i was way higher than what she expected and she agreed that it was better to just each go in their own way. this could not be the question at your situation but he could have imagined you differently than you are and probably being ashamed of going out with you thus when he was with you and your friends like you said he ignored you. i do think that a long relationship can be good and also bad.|`|qsWk3Fo6aa	Far Away by Nickelback|`|cpHGp0EMaa	I Can Wait Forever - Simple Plan <br>  Far Away - Nickelback|`|2y3ihWlWaa	how far-martina mcbride|`|dHcP602caa	Hey There Delilah - Plain White T's|`|kiglqcr0aa	<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiL_oO6onYM" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiL_oO6on...</a>|`|joaYX6HKaa	Incubus- i wish you were here|`|B7idbFNVaa	I stumble a pond this website while I was trying to play LOVE SONG for the wedding or Slow dance song.<br>  <br>  <br>  Here are the top 100 great love songs.<br>  <br>  Go here:<br>  <a href="http://www.associatedcontent.com/article/1379065/top_100_heartbreak_songs_heartache.html?cat=7" rel="nofollow">http://www.associatedcontent.com/article...</a>

I call him Joey if Im talking aloud. I think hes pretty awesome and my favorite brother. He may not be the sweetest guy but he has a good heart just like his brothers. Hes not always nice as he can be but nobodys nice all the time. People need to stop hating him over his breakup with Taylor Swift because he did what he thought was best and its not your business to hate anyway. if youre not in the situation then you cant judge. I love his outrageous outfits and I adore his genuine smile. My favorite moment recently is when he was laughing and smiling about that seal that scared him when they went to the Bahamas. that was adorable. hes an illiterate idiot but i love that about him<br>  <br>  Demi Lovato: like her, she is very pretty and she is a good singer but dont like her music (La La Land is ok) or as the Bell Rings. I dont watch Sonny with a Chance either. I dont think it would appeal to me as I am probly too old to get enjoyment out of it. <br>  <br>  Selena Gomez: indifferent but i dont think she should sing and she is too pretty even without makeup.<br>  <br>  Miley Cyrus: merely a spoiled teenage girl with crappy music<br>  <br>  Lindsay Lohan: ehhhh dont really have an opinion at the moment<br>  <br>  Britney Spears: i was a fan since she first started. shes only gotten crazy because of the media. she struggles to be left alone. who wouldnt go crazy in that situation?<br>  <br>  Cody Linley: ruined a song I really liked (Wonderwall) but I suppose I am indifferent otherwise<br>  <br>  David Archeleta: overrated but I dont really care. his music is eh<br>  <br>  Leonarda Dicaprio: indifferent<br>  <br>  Paris Hilton: dont care<br>  <br>  Perez Hilton: no opinion. I think people should just stop talking about her, thats probly what she wants<br>  <br>  Jordin Sparks: no opinion<br>  <br>  Dakota Fanning: no opinion except she acts awful mature for being a teenage girl<br>  <br>  Jennifer Anistion: indifferent<br>  <br>  Angelina Jolie: no opinion again<br>  <br>  Brad Pitt (heh I almost typed Bread): yeah I really dislike him. hes overrated so I dont get the hype. I dont see how people find him hot and hes in the media too much. if Im already tired of him and I watch little tv hes obviously been talked about excessively.|`|G7bDuuZ8aa	Nick Jonas: I don't care about him.<br>  Kevin Jonas:  I don't care about him.<br>  Joe Jonas: I don't care about him.<br>  Demi Lovato: Who?<br>  selena gomez: Who?<br>  miley cyrus: I don't care for her much.<br>  lindsay lohan: I don't care for her much.<br>  britney spears: One of the best female artists ever.<br>  cody linley: Who?<br>  david archuleta: Is he gay?<br>  leonardo decaprio: I don't care for him much.<br>  paris hilton: She should go to college.<br>  perez hilton: Um?<br>  jordin sparks: I like her music.<br>  dakota **nning: I don't like her movies<br>  jennifer aniston: One of my favorite actresses<br>  angelina jolie: HOME WRECKER!!<br>  bradp pitt: Before: HOT Now: UM!<br>  I don't really 'hate' any body.|`|mA59dkjXaa	Nick Jonas:  Not a fan,but cutes out of them all<br>  Kevin Jonas:  Not a fan<br>  Joe Jonas:  Not a fan <br>  Demi Lovato: Like her<br>  Selena gomez: Like her<br>  Miley cyrus: Shes okk but worse than Selena + Demi<br>  Lindsay lohan: Ehhhhh<br>  Britney spears: Circus kinda rocks <br>  Cody linley: Duno who he is??<br>  David archuleta: I like Crush<br>  Leonardo DiCaprio: Hes a good actor<br>  paris hilton: I agree with you about s.l.u.t!!<br>  perez hilton: He slags of GOOD celebraties<br>  jordin sparks: Like her music<br>  dakota fanning: Havent seen any of her movies<br>  jennifer aniston: Love her shes soooo cool!!!<br>  angelina jolie: I also agree with the stop making babies!!Shes gona have 50++ babies by the time she 50<br>  Brad pitt: Ewwww soooo old!!!|`|pgmXNpuOaa	Nick Jonas: he is ok<br>  Kevin Jonas: hes ok<br>  Joe Jonas: he is ok<br>  Demi Lovato: Love her<br>  selena gomez: also love her<br>  miley cyrus: i like her but she needs to stop acting like she is older than she is<br>  lindsay lohan: dont like her at all<br>  britney spears: I love  her<br>  cody linley dont care<br>  david archuleta: dont care <br>  leonardo decaprio: Love him<br>  paris hilton: i like her<br>  perez hilton: he annoys me now because he makes fun of tokio hotel<br>  jordin sparks: i like her alot<br>  dakota **nning: I like her i have no problem with her <br>  jennifer aniston: Love her way better than angie<br>  angelina jolie: I strongly dislike her<br>  bradp pitt: strongly dislike him too.|`|7dvHqzRcaa	i hate all jonus brothers they r so gay<br>  demi not a fan<br>  selena not a fan but shs better then miley cyrus i cant stand her<br>  lidsey lohan i like her music<br>  britney spears big fan<br>  cody  he looks like a girl<br>  david a he sucks really bad <br>  leonardo hes way hot <br>  paris is a huge ****<br>  periz kind of annoying<br>  decoda fanning shes a good actress<br>  jorden sparks shes good but blake should have won<br>  jennifer aniston im on her side alkali the way <br>  anglina jolie is way annoying with the kids and shes pretty ugly to :brad is just stupid and ugly|`|jvWAiGSwaa	Nick Jonas: hes cutee<br>  Kevin Jonas: hate him<br>  Joe Jonas: not a fann<br>  Demi Lovato: okaay<br>  selena gomez: shes cool<br>  miley cyrus: omg only little girls like her<br>  lindsay lohan: fire crotch.

Ow3O7h4caa	I can answer Taurus in Midheaven but the compatibility part is what I don't grasp LOL.<br>  <br>  To give you an idea, your 10th house reveals the nature of one’s career, overall potential contribution to society, and level of success in the material world. Your 1st (Ascendant) speaks about who you are, the 10th tells what you may achieve as an individual. The Ascendant reveals potentiality while the MC expresses the ripening of that potential and shows the methods and means through which a person expresses their responsibility to the world. It indicates the nature of the contribution. That is how you package yourself, and how you market your potential.<br>  <br>  Fixed signs – have the greatest and most marked influence in matters concerning profession or employment. You should be well advised not to change your profession or employment too frequently.<br>  <br>  Taurus being in your Midheaven shows a need for some kind of steady career path in order to function best. Irregular income is frightening to you.  Open air careers are appealling and  typical career routes include sports, horticulture or agriculture, financial management, food industry, accountancy, building, banking, singing, physiotherapy. Often an earth profession or one where administration is involved is a good choice and lastly. The arts.<br>  <br>  Venus rules your 10th and often promises success in all matters concerned with the pleasure of others. Your employment should have some connection with the female sex, for Venus favours women and all their requirements. The occupations under the influence of Venus are too numerous to describe, but, generally speaking, they are those which deal with objects and subjects that give pleasure to others. All those professions that are light and refined will be best suited to you so far as gain and enjoyment is concerned. You will meet with success in life through this position, and you will have many good friends to help you.<br>  <br>  Aspects to Venus and the MC would indicate the ease and / or hardships in attaining your goals as far as your career is concerned.<br>  Good Luck !!!!|`|cuIX13BKaa	The first answer knocked thisone out of the ballpark!<br>  <br>  Garbo<br>  <br>  (Bravo~!!!)

bHfuVh6kaa	everything she wants? - I am sure she would give every last brass pin back to watch her boys grow into men.|`|ZCo6OFToaa	Look, I was never her biggest fan, but the girl is doing all she can to make sure her boy's have a secure future, any parent would do the same if they were in her position, I do not think she is doing any wrong.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	It's sad, but people have had cancer forever. What makes her so special? I don't mean to sound callous, but she's certainly not the first person to have cancer and leave children behind.|`|G8zAPz8Maa	Will she donate any money to cancer charity's - I doubt it .She is a stupid woman who is worshipped by the other low life that cannot think for themselves and are told what to think by the media.<br>  <br>  Imagine how many families are going through redundancy and house repossessions and have to bear the thought of that poorly educated, racist woman getting paid ￡1m for marrying a convicted criminal.<br>  <br>  sorry for your losses|`|wh3EJtZeaa	I completely get what you're saying. Jade has said she wants to make as much money to secure her son's future, which is understandable. But there are so many children who suffer watching family members die of cancer. It's a horrible thing, and I too remember seeing my grandad die. Maybe all these tv & magazine people who are paying her a million pounds to watch her final moments should be more careing like you, & make a donation to cancer charities. But we know that won't happen unfortunately :(|`|AA12382198	She had the incentive to do this for her children.<br>  <br>  Since she started this hundreds of women have now been screened for cervical cancer.....so she's helping other women.<br>  <br>  I never heard of this woman before this happened to her.....it's her life and she's entitled to die the way she wants.<br>  <br>  I don't understand the judgment.|`|2a826ea115eb0860ddf6dc2e0ed050b4aa	.....and I bet all of you laughed at her when she stripped off on BB and made a fool of herself with PJ or whatever his name was but now she has turned to the media who once mocked her to secure her Boys future and you are all still butting in - damned if she does and damned if she dont.Big hugs to you and your family Jade.? xxxx|`|JafMj9LVaa	Yes i believe it is. I mean why not? She's trying to raise as much money as she can for her young boys' future and what's wrong with that? I believe anyone in her situation would do the same. Also not only that it has also raised more awarness of cervical cancer, i mean the amount of smears has gone up by 20% since she was diagnosed so it saves lives. She may have made mistakes in the past but who hasn't? Nobody deserves to go through what she is.|`|E6obQSpraa	why do people get bitter about this?<br>  <br>  yes, we all have family who have perhaps been through cancer, and died, or whatever, but there is absolutely no need to slag jade off.<br>  <br>  Our "families" are not "z list " celebrities who can make money out of it. Jade is.  She has 2 young sons and is determined to give them a better life than she had, and that is what she doing. Leave her alone. She is going to die soon. You would do the same.|`|T2C6hqaAaa	People are bound to focus on her coz she's in the public eye and we all know about it. It doesn't mean we don't care for the other ill people too.|`|CWpAKfC9aa	maybe it is ;maybe it is;nt i don;t want to sound unchristian but ;is all this publicity a bit over done?am i being a bit cynical ?;will she perhaps have a miracle cure and live happily ever after?in a way i hope she does, my wife had bowel cancer and was given a horrendous time with kemo and radiation treatment and an operation that took a large part of her bowel system away she has to wear a stoma bag . her chances were minimal,but it is now 5years on, and she is still here and doing fine ,she did;nt get a load of publicity but she has,nt a press agent and a deal with the tabloids,frankly iam sick and tired of seeing it in the media ,someone i know had the same illness as jade was given months to live and is still here  6years later.so lets see an end to it.|`|G3fQEJkVaa	I have had so many people in my life that have died of cancer also and I think that yes it is fair to give her attention. She's 27 with two young kids and she has weeks left to live that's what's not fair. She's in the public eye pretty much for better or for worse, this is the "for worse" part. The fact that she's going through the public eye being that sick and looking it also (shaved head) is inspiring. When cancer affects someone that we all know we see how possible it is for anyone to get it. It's sad but she's sort of like a spokesperson for cancer right now. I'm sure so many people are donating to the cause because of this. It's equally sad when ANYONE gets cancer, whether it's your grandfather my aunt or Jade Goody but at least she's trying and use her power for good and letting everyone see how bad her situation is.|`|mnn8hYbtaa	Is it fair that 2 little lads will lose their Mummy very soon? Is it fair that when they grow up they will not be able to remember her much (if at all) because they were so young when she died?<br>  Its not Jades fault that other people had cancer and didnt get the right treatment.<br>  If she was trying to live her final days in peace away from the media she would have to be dodging the papparazzi all the time so she might as well make some money out of it. I just hope its her boys that benefit from it and not the louse she's married

9osOF1rfaa	Jackman was more different of an oscar host than Jon was from Billy. This guy is a triple threat, many host's of the awards have done music numbers and been good, but they were all comedians. Here is an actor, no stand up comic, trained in acting and music (obviously) who had to make people laugh and he did. That was much harder than a comic trying to sing and dance, because if they sound and look bad it's ok, because it would be funny.|`|Lgh6umPAaa	Your question, I'm afraid, is unanswerable except with opinion. That said, Hugh Jackman should be a totally, entirely, wholly, globally, completely different type of Oscar Host than JS or BC. In fact, JS and BC and all previous hosts I can think of have been the same, and so "similar", in this way: they are comedians. Hugh Jackman is an actor's actor.|`|hEFthejvaa	i don't think hugh jackman being a host is a good idea. not that i hate him, but he's obviously not a comdedian. jon stewart was the best though.<br>  the only reason he was even recognized was when he was announced sexiest man of 2008. whether or not he performs horribly at least the ladies will have something to scream at.|`|a1Ngi39Xaa	I found the following clip which I thought was kind of interesting.  He has been a Presenter before at the Oscars.  Disappointing about the Australia moving being passed over.  I will post again after the opening.<br>  <br>  Los Angeles (PTI): Australian actor Hugh Jackman, host of the 81st Academy Awards, was chosen for the big night for his "style, elegance and a sense of occasion".<br>  <br>  "Hugh Jackman is a consummate entertainer and an internationally renowned movie star," said the awards telecast producer Laurence Mark and executive producer Bill Condon in a joint statement.<br>  <br>  "He also has style, elegance and a sense of occasion. Hugh is the ideal choice to host a celebration of the year's movies - and to have fun doing it," the statement said.<br>  <br>  Edit:  Not as good as Billy Crystal.  Had a few good moments but kinda mundane...|`|2zgv89OQaa	I think Hugh Jackman is an excellent choice over all the other Host.   Not only is he devastatingly handsome but very funny as well.   I think this year's Oscars will be the best yet!
O9HLoDj9aa	Aries is a fire sign. Mix two fire signs together, and you get a passionate, albeit fiery and heated relationship. They might fight a lot, but I bet the sex is good.|`|3CXfqxcgaa	Fire with fire. Arguments. They are hard workers|`|QZzQdh43aa	What starts in an instant as a hot, fiery affair can turn quickly into a conflagration. Each is headstrong, and wants to be top dog in this duo. This is a dynamic, go out until dawn pair, until there's an argument and then, watch out. Doors slamming, shouting in public and when two warriors face-off, there could be actual physical brawling.<br>  <br>  Aries forgives easily and doesn't hold onto anger, but here you've got two alphas in one pack. There may always be a competitive feeling to the relationship. And when things get complicated, one or both may bail too easily. Aries loves to start things, but moves on at hints of emotional hand-wringing, or having to work out a mental puzzle. They'll hang in there as long as it's fresh, adventurous and sexually satisfying, but in the end, this pairing calls for compromise. And that's not the Aries strong suit. Good while it lasts, and never a dull moment -- an unforgettable fling, but not necessarily for the long haul.|`|5qvIZCKXaa	Both enter with the intent of dominating the scenario. A passionate affair, but neither is content with playing the smaller role. The Aries female tends to dominate (generally because domineering females have to try harder to get their way than domineering males). However, there will be fierce competition to be number one. Eventually, the flare-ups and heavy cannonading take their toll in the bedroom, and what starts out so promisingly ends in disharmony. The situation dictates that both need their own careers or directions independent of one another for this to work. When their energies are diverted into other areas, conflict between the two becomes a bit more playful and less destructive.|`|9MRSjkkxaa	woahh, not good. they are both rams and will butt heads.

I hope that makes sense. :)<br>  <br>  xo|`|3ZgtJK9raa	Hmmm... ok when you play the piano... dont let the notes freak you out. Just relax and play. Thats how I do it and I can play really nice. Of course I've been playing since I was 5 and I tough myself... but hey!! O and I just skipped all that easy stuff and went to the songs... I recomend you do the same :-)|`|PpzKXnlEaa	I'm going to answer two questions, because you kinda have two different things going on here.  <br>  <br>  First--G position means to place your right hand thumb on G and your left hand pinky on G.<br>  <br>  Second--I'm not sure why you would use G position to play a C major scale.  Fingering for that scale would be:     Right hand:  C1, D2, E3 (cross thumb under) F1 G2 A3 B4 C5.    Left Hand:  C5, D4, E3, F2, G1, (cross third finger over) A3 B2, C1.  Right hand changes position on "F" and left hand changes position on "A" (with 3rd finger on "A")  Playing the scale descending uses exactly the same fingers on the same notes as going up.

gGZz2EGyaa	I do not think so he left everything mainly to his daughter with her mother as the executor till she came of age.  I have had a quick look on search and it does not say that Ginger was left anything in Elvis's will.<br>  <br>  This is really the only thing is says about Ginger:-<br>  Elvis and Ginger came in from playing Racquetball on August 16th and Elvis went to go read a book in his bathroom. Ginger fell asleep and woke early that afternoon to find his lifeless body in the bathroom. At age 42, Elvis Presley was dead.<br>  After Presley's death, Ginger had a successful career in modelling, radio, television and film. She worked in numerous commercials, made guest appearances on television shows, and signed on to be a regular cast member of the 1986–87 season of the daytime soap opera, Capitol alongside Teri Hatcher.<br>  <br>  Judging from the above it does not sound like she was left a substantial amount of money from Elvis.|`|AA12263840	I have read an abridged version, OF Elvis' will, and, - from the text, of it, - it would appear, that most of his estate was left in trust, for his little girl, - Lisa-Marie, - who was just EIGHT years old, when he passed away!

vhc5GSo3aa	Hi there!  I was married to a Taurus for 7 years and lived with another Taurus as well for 5 years.  The reasons they are both X's is because they both tried to control me (and I refuse to be controlled) and because they were always telling me what to do and if I didn't do it then I was stupid, made bad decisions, etc. etc.  They both made me feel like I wasn't good enough.  Neither appreciated the person that I am.  Neither of my x's were womanizers or liars.  They were both very loyal and faithful and I honestly don't think you have to worry about this.  Another big problem was that Taurus' like to plan things out and then stick with the plan no matter what.  I could never stick to their plan because I'm so spontaneous and this upset both of them ALOT.  Great relationships in the beginning, but over time I felt like I was under their thumb and had no space to just be me.  It may sound crazy, but I will never even date another Taurus man.  Hope this helps!|`|Fmebuub7aa	I'm dating a taurus man...I'm  a gemini but I'm sag rising<br>  <br>  I have to say my biggest challenge with him is that he's very secretive about his life...it almost makes me want to call him a liar, but I dont think thats it, I think he's just private...the thing thats irritating is this homebody thing taurus men dont seem to be very free-spirited, they get boring they are so content doing basically NOTHING!!!  If your taurus man is anything like mine and if your a typical fire sign who likes to have fun, I wish you luck...date an air sign sparks fly with fire and air|`|8ZUVToXgaa	All Tauruses are NOT womanizers, btw.

Not predictable! xD|`|0Tew2jDlaa	its about not likeing your self. the writer doesnt make it clear wat she/he dislikes but it could be that the person thinks that he/she is to skinny or fat or ugly or maybe the person doesn't like his/her personality<br>  <br>  the person think that he'/she is living a lie

by8Czojuaa	Remakes (apparently) like to give deeper origin stories. I recently watched the remake of Halloween.<br>  <br>  I Am Legend > animated comics > Shelter<br>  <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20090218230211AAGi7cn&r=w">http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?...</a>|`|lDbNf3h9aa	Try renting both versions of The Blob.|`|SM66sORiaa	Psycho 1960, 1998<br>  Last House On The Left 1972, 2009<br>  Amityville Horror 1979, 2005<br>  Hitcher 1986, 2007<br>  Halloween 1978, 2007<br>  Friday the 13th 1980, 2009<br>  Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974, 2003<br>  and were waiting on the new A Nightmare On Elm Street and Childs Play remakes to name a few movies and years the originals and remakes were made. I would like to start by sayin I disagree with ignant in sayin they are tryin to humanize the characters. I believe there arent any ways to humanize the characters in real horror movie. The original Halloween showed Michael Myers as a child also. If you didnt notice the new actor Tyler Mane who played Michael appears to be of inhumane size unlike the original who wasnt much taller than Jamie Lee Curtis. It is to add more of a modern touch to the films just as much as the newer Star Wars movies now that we can do certain things with movies that we couldnt do then. Of course you cant replace that scream affect from the originals.<br>  p.s. the only reason we are making the reimaging which is what they are really called not remakes. Is because the film industry is tired of taking our ideas for horror films from the Japanese. Why are they called reimaging you might ask well its because we have Blu-Ray disc now. The older movies will remain classics folks but we cant watch that same foggy picture forever these new movies are def better when it comes to resolution.|`|umEgRb7Vaa	There is more visual gore, but I think that they have tried to humanize the killer more in the remakes. In the originals the killer would be a force of evil or death. In the remakes they make the killer out to be a person who has gone bad. The remakes make you feel that the killer could actually be destroyed. The originals make it seem that they can't.|`|ul56QBVmaa	Rob Zombie's Halloween is a lot more graphic than the Original Halloween, in remakes, it dosent work if they just recreate the whole story, so they totally change it and invent twists and turns, On the halloween remake, it goes deeper into Michael's life and explains abit why he ended up the way he is|`|by6skUmMaa	The remake of Amityville horror is better than the original.. in my opinion.

Ow3O7h4caa	Moon to Node aspects indicate spiritual unions and/or alliances between women, family ties, etc.... It can be one indicator of multiple relationships also, don't kid yourself. <br>  The house indicates the area that it will be experienced in depending if the north node is in 6th or 12th, and the south is 6th or 12th house which you didn't specify.<br>  <br>  With the north node in 12th house, the person will have to face their fears through secret associations, medicine or psychology due to the fact that they ignore their inner needs by taking care too much of detail and a workaholic routine.

AwBVoWOaaa	We all know it is between Sean Penn and Mickey.<br>  I hope Mickey wins, but they both were amazing. Part of the reason I want Mickey to win is because he has not won before. And because I'm a sucker for cinderella stories.<br>  <br>  I watched both performances (actually, I've seen all of the acting nominees this year, except for Melissa Leo) and I really, really want Mickey to win because I want to hear another of his awesome speeches. I'm not gonna cry if he doesn't win, but if he wins, I will. Of happiness.<br>  <br>  My wishes aside, he truly was amazing in THE WRESTLER.|`|VAb2mSg0aa	I didn't see the wrestler unfortunately. However, everyone that I know that saw it, agreed with everyone else and said that his acting was unbelievable. He's been through a lot these past years, so yeah you could say the he definitely deserves it. However, I saw 'Milk' and was left baffled my Sean Penn's performance. It was the most amazing thing that I have ever seen in my life. But, like I said, I didn't see 'The wrestler' , so I can't choose who I think should win.|`|RDsdnkmfaa	No performance was half as good as Mickey Rourke's.<br>  I watched every single one nominated and I loved them all.

And if he wins, I will be so damn happy.<br>  Never before have I been so emotionally invested in the Oscars.|`|XKRvc2HOaa	i want him to win because if u watch wresting chris jerico doesnt want him to win so i want him to win|`|sNr9Od89aa	no way, sean penn. milk better also win best picture, it was so touching.|`|Klb4ZYcVaa	Rourke was incredible, but I think Sean Penn deserves it. <br>  <br>  The Wrestler should win SOMETHING though.

zCOvQwQhaa	Baritone B.C. is Baritone Horn written in the bass clef.  This instrument is the only band instrument that has parts supplied in both treble clef and bass clef.  Part of the reason is that many baritone horn players transfer over from either trumpet or trombone - having both parts makes the transition easier.<br>  <br>  While most players in lower HS and below play either bass or treble clef, most senior players and those above high school read bass, treble, and tenor clefs fluently.<br>  <br>  Bass Clarinet is abbreviated as BCl or B Clar -- there is no named baritone or tenor member of the clarinet family.  The basset horn is an alto member as is the G clarinet - the next instrument is the bass (which many believe is truly a tenor voice) and then the EEb contra-alto and BBb contrabass.|`|dTgLD1Qsaa	It actually stands for "Bass Clef," opposed to Baritone T.C., or "Treble Clef."  It is just a way of differentiating between the two.  The baritone is an instrument, also known as the euphonium.  Hope that helps!|`|10a3088be2987a483495e512fb8d2c26aa	it means "baritone"  (the small tuba-like instrument) with it's music written in the bass clef.  there is also baritone t.c. which is the same instrument but the music is written in the treble clef.

As for the slutty factor, the paporazzi don't see what normal  16 year olds do or wear. Where I live people at 15 are already clubbing and drinking and wearing things way more provocative than what she wears. Her pictures are things that were probably never meant to get out there. I've taken some stupid pictures at one point or another in my life also the only difference is mine weren't there for the whole world to see or to judge. I think that since she's like a child star everyone's just waiting for her to screw up. Like Britney, or Lindsay and maybe she will or maybe she won't. No one has the right to judge someone else when they don't even know her. Like all the people that posted things above me. How do you know she's really stupid? You don't. Maybe she is, but maybe she isn't. She's not my favorite person in the world but I don't get why everyone hates her so much, she's just a normal teenager.|`|B7mzzhZ5aa	no one knows whats going on in her life. she should be in the media attention only for entertaining (acting and singing) she could be the nicest person eveer or she could be horrible. but the media speak **** and pick on her. every family fights just another fact that makes her normal, sure she makes mistakes but then can we relate to her in that prospect? shes a normal kid living her dream we should support her instead of torture her just for our own entertaining purposes. how can we like or hate someone we dont even know??|`|jUVqXdCoaa	I think that her music is lame! The only reason she is a star is because her daddy. she can't sing worth crap in my opinion! she is way too skinny! Not a good influence on children i mean when kids look into magazines and see their hero " Miley cyrus" posing naked then what are they going to think!? Well she's my hero and she is famous so i should do that too.....!? I don't think so!|`|fgnQ2vLqaa	I think her parents are mostly to blame, but there's no turning back now. I think MC is somewhat talented, undereducated, spoiled, self-absorbed, and too big for her britches. Make that too big for her ripped tights.|`|cVtHEVRnaa	UHHHHMAZING?!?!?!??!?!??!??!?|`|cPjX0dHIaa	I can't say or else I'd get kicked off of yahoo answers|`|NSLmZ9vzaa	NOTHING!<br>  just a fake singer!!!!!!!!!!!|`|oaVhxc8caa	I hate her!!!!|`|d46f610a60316733e6c17cc867554da4aa	I honestly do not understand why she is so popular - then again, I'm a guy over the age of 13, so suppose I'm not alone. As a person, I really have no idea what she's like since I don't know her - not to mention that young stars usually have an entire public relations staff to help "shape" their image - obviously, this does not always work to prevent unwanted images from surfacing, as in Miley's case. I can say that Miley seems to be more stable than crazy britney, but then again, most people did not know britney was crazy until years after her debut.<br>  <br>  Miley's debatable talent or personality aside, she is a product of the Disney corporate machine and its formula for success: find a girl that other girls would really like (years of casting auditions), put the girl on TV, develop a gimmicky plot for the series which younger girls would like or find attractive, once the show develops a large following, put her on tour (as the character, no less) where parents shell-out $100's to see Hannah Montana. After making hundreds of millions of dollars, she tours as herself and continues earning big $$ (until her demographic audience changes musical tastes once they average age 16 or a little older). Then it's on to the new Disney phenomenon...|`|CGJwPYRTaa	i believe that she can't sing,has an annoying voice and i really don't like her and her attitude. plus her family is nuts to let her date a twenty year old in her house and shes only sixteen! OMG i thinks she is very disgusting.|`|aCaB57rxaa	i hate her. no talent what so ever. i am only 11 so i went to one of her concerts with my little sister and she dropped the mic and she was somehow sing perfectly loud and the same. total ashley simpson moment. hilarious.|`|mCgOlHHXaa	I think she is cute, definitely girlfriend type.

YbIiwut7aa	No one knows where Aaron is right now. The last we saw of him, he was in Sun's car, just before she stepped out with a gun to confront Ben Linus. Since then, there's been no mention of Aaron except for when Jack asks Kate where Aaron is. Kate turns to Jack and tells him to never speak about Aaron again, which would imply that it's something serious. I'm guessing we figure out what it is this week.<br>  <br>  To shed some light on the situation, I was listening to the Lost podcast and I heard writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof talking. Apparently, last week's episode and this week's episode were originally set to air in the opposite order. At the last minute, they switched them up. Cuse and Lindelof say these are the only Lost episodes that can be viewed in either order. Which would imply that if we viewed them in the opposite order, we would know why Kate reacted with such venom to Jack's question. So, I'm guessing we figure that out next week.|`|WPH6O73gaa	no one knows, and no<br>  <br>  You should watch it online. This season is great|`|Wcq9eJVuaa	um im trying to think....<br>  the basis of the last episode was that jack saw john body and gave him his fathers shoes (ull have to look up on that cause i missed the begining) and then everyone got on the plane to go back to the island, turns out they had the same pilot that took them off the island. Ben got beat  up pretty badly, but they didnt go into any detail about that. the last thing that happened was they crashed in the island, then jack, hurely and kate saw jin, and it was a WTF moment. <br>  <br>  nothing on poor little aaron...=(<br>  i think they did find out, but im not sure...?<br>  <br>  i think they will play this episode on wed. before the new one.<br>  <br>  <3 lost!

Just chill out for the few hours before the test.  Jeopardy isn't about studying, it's about knowing.  If you know it, you'll know it.  If you don't you don't.  So just relax and do the best you can.<br>  <br>  P.S.  I'm taking the test too.  Hope to see you on the show ;)<br>  <br>  Edit:  Finished the test.  It was pretty easy.  Studying really couldn't have helped you much.  It was pretty easy, but there was a few wildcards that were a little tough.|`|HVPKbLLBaa	im also taking it<br>  im 13 too<br>  study anything you can|`|c6051428a5c680a820a4684731a420beaa	Most of the questions were pretty easy. I missed the Latin "to lick" question, which really upset me because I studied Latin for 3 years.<br>  Grammys was definitely Jennifer Hudson. I got that one at the last second. I stupidly put Rio de Janero (sp?) instead of Sao Paulo. Ego stulta sum!<br>  The winner last year was a girl my school in my grade (she's a really sweet, smart girl). We're on quiz team together and she's a million times better than I am, so I probably won't get on.<br>  Oh, and the bearded guy on adult Jeopardy last week was my sister's TA at Northwestern. He's using his winnings to pay off his massive college loans.|`|XJkLHsGDaa	I don't know but I'm taking it tomorrow too!  If you want to study than just watch a bunch of episodes of jeopardy, write down topics that you did not know much about, and then research it on the internet.  I'm only 13, so I doubt I'll make it, but I think have an okay chance.  See you at the tourney! (lol)|`|DJpS9GDxaa	I'm doing it too!<br>  this is my first time, so I can't really answer your questions. Just stay calm and don't overwork yourself before hand. Good luck!!!!<br>  <br>  EDIT: just finished...it was pretty hard...oh well, i have 4 more times to try|`|X3QBqLSHaa	I took it last year, it's really easy! Like last year I was in 7th grade, and the questions were like for 5th grade.|`|L3r4QQgvaa	well.... to tell you the truth... It's my first audition too! I just turned 14 like... 2 weeks ago. I had no idea about auditions last year. Anyways, I'm pretty sure that you (we, as in the teenage community reading this and studying for jeopardy) would have to study stuff like teen lit, math, science, history, that stuff. if you can answer questions on the regular show (don't lie, i know you all like to scream out the answers). then i'm pretty sure that you'll get through. i'm testing tonight at 5:30 (PST) and I wish you all the best of luck!<br>  <br>  peace out.<br>  KM.|`|0w4PTFy5aa	I'm logging in in about 30 minutes :D<br>  So excited, just got done watching it on TV and it got me so psyched ahaha. I also new the answers to a majority of the adult questions which made me feel better.<br>  I really don't think there's any reason to study though, so don't sweat it, just enjoy it!<br>  Good luck :)<br>  <br>  edit:<br>  <br>  Ok I just took it and MY GOD WAS IT HARD D:<br>  Ugh some of those questions were harder than the adult ones!|`|TjnRQcrKaa	Just finished it. Not bad, I thought it would be a lot worseafter reviwing past questions. I definitely got stumped on about 6 or 7 (mostly about those damn American authors, yuck!), but I heard that 35 out of 50 is the cut off.<br>  <br>  I didn't really study much, since I was already studying for my World Maps in geography and Shakespeare in Theatre. Pop culture is my strong point, so I had no issues with that. I also checked out past Teen Tournament questions and answered them, which really helped.<br>  <br>  I'm so glad I'm just a giant sponge... good luck on the results!<br>  I wonder when we get those...|`|gPQ1u3FRaa	some more that I remember:<br>  <br>  the "rhyme time" answer was Shark Park<br>  The question about india was new delhi<br>  the one with the three counties [citrus, manatee, and one other] was florida<br>  the twilight question was bella swan<br>  <br>  I'll remember more later|`|gZYUexIlaa	I signed up too! Basically you should expect a variety of questions. Review your major history, science, math, popular teen literature, states and capitals...stuff like that.<br>  Good luck!|`|WJW4qOlUaa	Best of Luck to u!! I bet the question will seem easier before the show but then on the show people are usually nervous and then the questions can seem harder.|`|8gCTmbQlaa	man i think i got like 30 right<br>  tht means im not going to jepordy?|`|vtiHA6Gdaa	I'm taking it tonight too! It seems most of the people who've answered this are (: I'm not going into it with any kind of preparation, since I'm only doing it for fun and I can't go to the next level even if I do make it past the online test, so I don't really care. I'm probably not going to pass anyways, lol, but I hope you make it (:|`|xUsXSoopaa	Answers: <br>      The one about Mark Twain's biography was Life on the Missouri. At the Grammy's Paul McCartney sang "I saw her standing there." Twelfth Night is correct too.  Then the poem one was from Obama's inauguration, The 26 element is iron. Greenhouse effect. The Golden Spike at Promontory Point. The bottom of a fraction is the denominator. Lake Champlain is Vermont's lowest point. Those are all the ones I can remember....|`|KkpRFEKUaa	I missed 12 or 13, so that puts me at 37 or 38 out of 40. I took the test last year and didn't do nearly as well. Does anyone have any idea when we'll be contacted if we were chosen to advance? Someone mentioned a 35/40 cutoff, so if that's the case, I should be set... but that's speaking optimistically.|`|TkTe1g1qaa	yah, the question was about like "you pulled me through" or something, which wasn't paul, it was jennifer hudson. and the mark twain one was definitely mississippi, not missouri.  i've been trying to recall and i have 32 right so far out of 42 questions i can remember, it's driving me crazy!|`|hpmq6o2faa	im taking the test tonight too, sorry im not much of an assistance now, i study my world geography,  literature, pop culture and yeah , oh and the presidents. good luck, maybe we will be competing against each other  in the near future =]|`|AA10225692	I had the same question.  I have just watched Jeopardy every day (which isn't anything unusual for me), so I'm probably unprepared, but the categories are so wide that it would be nearly impossible to study effectively.|`|IMIOp04naa	hey guys dont freak out about the test. it is like soooooooooooooooo esay u no boy! just relax man. calm it down. take some pills if u need to. you got some time so do some yoga if u need. peace out brotha! see ya soon. <br>  <br>  your friend<br>  shipoopi|`|eppH9IQ9aa	I remember the answer about religion was agnostic, I think.  <br>  <br>  I missed quite a few b/c I was too slow, and I didn't realize there were categories to the questions until I was halfway done.

In the bookstores, they're often labeled "June" or "Yaoi" or "Boy's Love" - Digital Manga Publishing and Blu put out many of them.<br>  <br>  Have you read or seen "Antique Bakery"?  It's not a romance (I'm not even sure if I would call it shounen-ai/yaoi), but it does include gay men.  One of of the main characters is referred to as the "Gay of Demonic Charm."<br>  <br>  ...are you looking for anime that are NOT yaoi/shounen-ai, but include gay characters as side characters?  If so, there's Touya/Yukito in Cardcaptor Sakura.  And Nuriko in Fushigi Yuugi, and Zoisite/Kunzite in Sailor Moon.   (...probably not what you're looking for, though.)|`|c6zBPGooaa	There aren't really much Boys' Love and yaoi anime.<br>  <br>  <br>  Manga will be your other best option.

Instantly the cat had a huge, fluffy pillow. A few days later, six mice were killed in an accident, and they all went to heaven together. God met them at the gates of Heaven with the same offer He made to the cat. The mice said, "Well, all our lives we've had to run from dogs, cats and even people with brooms. If we could just have some little roller skates, we'd never have to run again." God said, "It is done!" All the mice had beautiful little roller skates. About a week later, God decided to check on the cat. He found her sound asleep on her fluffy pillow. God gently awakened the cat and asked, "Is everything okay? How you been doing? Are you happy?" The cat replied, "Oh, I've never been so happy in my life! My pillow is so fluffy, and those little meals-on-wheels you've been sending over here are delicious!"<br>  -------------------<br>  A cowboy was drinking at a bar. Then later, a person (man) came in and sat down beside the cowboy and asked him,"Hey, man! Are you a real cowboy?" <br>  <br>  The cowboy answered,"Yup, I've been a cowboy for my entire life." With that, the person walked away.<br>  <br>  Then later, another person (woman) came in and sat down beside the cowboy and asked him,"Hey, man! Are you a real cowboy?"<br>  <br>  The cowboy answered,"Yup, I've been a cowboy for my entire life." But the person did not walk away, but said,"Well, I'm a lesbian. I think of girls when I wake up, I think of girls when I eat, I think of girls when i sleep. I think of girls all the time!" With that, the lesbian walked away.<br>  <br>  Then later, another person (man) came in and sat down beside the cowboy and asked him,"Hey, man! Are you a real cowboy?"<br>  <br>  The cowboy answered,"Well, I thought I was a cowboy. But now I think I'm a lesbian!"<br>  -----------------<br>  Lila died and went to heaven where she was greeted by St. Peter. St Peter showed her around and Lila noticed strange-looking items that looked like clocks all over the place. Curious, she asked, "St. peter, what are these?"<br>  <br>  St. peter: Lying-detectors. Whenever someone lies, his detector's hand moves.<br>  <br>  She noticed one that didn't move and asked, "Wow, whose is this?"<br>  <br>  "Mother Teresa's."<br>  <br>  As an American, she was curious about her president's detector.<br>  <br>  "Where's Bush's?" She asks.<br>  <br>  "Oh, it isn't here. It's in Jesus' office, he uses it as a fan.<br>  -----------<br>  A man was driving in the middle of nowhere down a secluded country road far from any cities. He got a flat tyre, and got out to walk for help. After walking for some time, he came to a small stone monastery. He knocked on the door and roused the monks. "I've got a flat tyre. Can I use your phone?" He asked.<br>  <br>  The monks said they were sorry, but they did not have a phone. "If you stay tonight, you can get a ride on our wagon into town tomorrow," they said. So the man stayed the night, and they put him in a small room in the monastery.<br>  <br>  In the middle of the night, the man was awakened suddenly by a noise. Not just any noise, but the loudest, most wonderful, most terrifying, most hair-raising noise ever.<br>  <br>  He sat there, his heart beating for a few minutes, and he heard it again!Getting out of bed, he went running in the direction of the noise. It came again, making the hair on the back of his neck rise and his skin crawl. Finally, he came to a large door where the head monk was standing. The door was at least 15 feet tall, and made of solid-looking wood and metal. It had chains and bars and locks and a deadbolt on it, and was the most formidable door the man had ever seen.<br>  <br>  "What was that sound?" he asked. "What made it? Is it behind that door?"<br>  <br>  The head monk shook his head. "I'm sorry," he said. "I can't tell you; you're not a monk."<br>  <br>  As the man turned away, he heard the noise again. "You have to tell me what it is," he begged.<br>  <br>  "I'm sorry, I can't tell you, you're not a monk," said the monk.<br>  <br>  The man tried to sleep, but couldn't get the noise out of his head. In the morning, as he was getting ready to leave, he heard the sound again. It made his ears ring and his mind whirl.<br>  <br>  "Please tell me what made that sound," he said.<br>  <br>  But the monks wouldn't. "I'm sorry, you're not a monk" was all they said.<br>  <br>  The man left, and eventually got his car fixed and went back to his life. But he couldn't get the sound out of his mind. After a few months, he got in his car and drove and drove until he found the monastery again. He got out of his car and found the head monk.<br>  <br>  "I can't forget that sound from that night I was here. Please, please please tell me what made that sound."<br>  <br>  The head monk just shook his head. "I can't tell you; you're not a monk," he said.<br>  <br>  "Then tell me how I can become a monk," the man said.<br>  <br>  The head monk said "It's very difficult. Are you sure you want to do this?"<br>  <br>  The man said "I've got to. I have to know what made that sound."<br>  <br>  The head monk said, "To join us, you have to perform several tasks. Your first task is to count all of the stars visible in the sky."<br>  <br>  The man thought about how hard that would be, but he had to know what made that sound. He sat up every night for a year, counting the stars over and over until he was sure how many stars were visible in the sky.<br>  <br>  He went to the head monk and told him, and the monk nodded. "Very good. Your next task is to count all of the grains of sand on the beaches around the world."<br>  <br>  The man knew this would be even harder, but he could not get the noise out of his head. He had to know what, what kind of animal, could make that terrible horrible mind-bending sound. So he left on his journeys. He crawled the length and breadth of every beach in the world, counting the grains of sand, and he returned to the monastery years later.<br>  The head monk heard his answer and nodded. "Excellent. You are almost done. Your final task is to climb to the peak of the highest mountain in the world, and see yourself in relation to the rest of creation."<br>  And the man knew this would be hard, but he outfitted himself, and he went to the highest mountain in the world, and he climbed to the top, and returned months later, older and wiser and more tired than years before when he had first heard the noise, the noise that would not leave his mind and that echoed in his every waking thought.<br>  <br>  He returned, and the head monk saw that he was wiser, and said "At last, you are a monk. Come with me."<br>  <br>  And they walked through the monastery, its twisting and turning halls, and as they went the man heard the noise again, over and over, and he was no longer sure if it was the noise or merely his memory of it.<br>  <br>  And finally, finally, he stood in front of the door and the head monk opened it up, and the man saw what had made the noise.<br>  <br>  What was the noise?<br>  <br>  I cant tell ya, ur not a monk!|`|e3vQ4BWaaa	I don't have any funny jokes today ...I am sad ...  :<|`|FIphLGroaa	Here are some:<br>  <br>  · A man checked into a hotel in Australia.

Usually, she slept through the class. One day the teacher called on her while she was sleeping, "Tell me Mary Margaret, who created the universe?" When Mary Margaret didn't stir, little Johnny who was her friend sitting behind her, took his pencil and jabbed her in the rear. "God Almighty!" shouted Mary Margaret. <br>  <br>  The teacher said, "very good" and continued teaching the class. A little later the nun asked Mary Margaret, "Who is our Lord and savior?" But she didn't stir from her slumber. Once again, little Johnny came to her rescue and stuck Mary Margaret in the butt. "Jesus Christ!" " shouted Mary Margaret and the teacher once again said "very good" and Mary Margaret fell back to sleep. <br>  <br>  The teacher asked her a third question "what did Eve say to Adam after she had her tenth child?" Again, Johnny to the rescue. This time Mary Margaret jumped up and shouted, "if you stick me with that damn thing one more time, I'll break it in half!"

The result would be super effective because c'thun is poison type.<br>  <br>  Now let's consider some other factors. Pokemon simply cannot die. They only faint. C'thun can be killed.  <br>  <br>  Lastly Hitmonchan is a thug. He's a G because he punches his opponents down with his fists until he wins.<br>  <br>  When scaling C'thun down to pokemon terms, he stands no chance.

B2ZCLdGNaa	Personal life<br>  <br>  Wonder has been married twice—to Motown singer Syreeta Wright from 1970 until their divorce in 1972; and since 2001, to fashion designer Kai Milla Morris.[35] He has seven children from his two marriages and several relationships.[35]<br>  <br>  His daughter, Aisha Morris, was the inspiration for his hit single "Isn't She Lovely." Aisha Morris is a singer who has toured with her father and accompanied him on recordings, including his 2005 album, A Time 2 Love. Wonder has two sons with Kai Milla Morris; the older is named Kailand and he occasionally performs as a drummer on stage with his father. The younger son, Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris, was born May 13, 2005, his father's 55th birthday.<br>  <br>  In May 2006, Wonder's mother died in Los Angeles, California, at the age of 76. During his September 8, 2008 UK concert in Birmingham he spoke of his decision to begin touring again following his loss. "I want to take all the pain that I feel and celebrate and turn it around".<br>  <br>  Wonder is an activist for civil rights and endorsed 2008 United States Democratic Party presidential candidate Barack Obama, who would later be elected 44th President of the United States, the first African American to do so. Apparently, the respect is more than mutual, as Obama responded to a Rolling Stone interview question that asked him who his musical heroes are by saying: "If I had one, it would have to be Stevie Wonder. When I was just at that point where you start getting involved in music, Stevie Wonder had that run with Music of My Mind, Talking Book, Fulfillingness' First Finale and Innervisions, and then Songs in the Key of Life. Those are as brilliant a set of five albums as we've ever seen."[36]<br>  <br>  Children:<br>  <br>      * Aisha Morris (born April,1975) (by Yolanda Simmons)<br>      * Keita Morris (by Yolanda Simmons)<br>      * Kwame Morris<br>      * Mumtaz Morris (by Melody McCulley)<br>      * Sophia Morris<br>      * Kailand Morris (by Kai Milla Morris)<br>      * Mandla Kadjay Carl Stevland Morris (born May 13, 2005) (by Kai Milla Morris)<br>  <br>  Wonder's children are by wife Kai Milla Morris, Yolanda Simmons and Melody McCulley.

lQbyeAcHaa	1.Put hair removal cream in thier conditioner<br>  <br>  2 Habanero Pepper Surprise<br>  Obtain a small hypodermic needle and syringe <br>  Fill it with Habanero pepper extract or hot sauce. <br>  Inject extract or sauce into your roommate's fruit, vegetables, cakes, ice cream, and anything else you can find that's edible. <br>  This will make them "happy". Additionally they will be scared to eat anything in the house for weeks, including snagging your food for a quick bite. <br>  <br>  3 get a bit of dog poo, (the fresher the better) and stick it under their car door handle, so it can't be seen, when they go to open the door they get a handful of sh*t.<br>  <br>  4 Using 2 ketchup packs, (the type used for carry out fries). the lay one on top of another and rolled the bottoms up together like you would a tube of toothpaste. This creates a double sack of ketchup for the assault. <br>  <br>  Using a pin, poke a hole in each one near the exposed end seam on the outer sides. Now you have a ketchup pack that will squirt in two directions at once. <br>  <br>  To set this funny prank in motion, place the premade pack below the foot under a toilet seat. The unsuspecting victim will sit down and get shot in the "nether regions" as well as creating a scary discharge into the toilet. <br>  <br>  5 Take a long, narrow potato (one that will fit well into an exhaust pipe) and drill a hole in it long ways. Then rig a whistle in one end or find one of those long, thin whistles and stick it in the potato hole. Potato goes in the tailpipe. When the victim gets in the car and starts it up they'll wonder where the hell that noise is coming from! <br>  <br>  6 Have you noticed how many times people rub their eyes? Well they do heaps you just don't notice. Best to do this at a friend's house if you are staying temporarily. <br>  <br>  Bring a knife and some very hot peppers. The hottest you can get your hands on! <br>  Cut the peppers into really fine pieces while your friend isn't watching. (you can do it in the bathroom) <br>  Smear pepper juice all over the door knobs in the house (the victim grabs the knobs in the house not knowing of the substance smeared on the knob. <br>  Wash hands thoroughly. <br>  Sit back, act normal, and watch and ENJOY the pain of your victim (rubbing there eyes continuously making it worse). <br>  <br>  that should start you out|`|0tXcfq0waa	if they drink from a milk carton all the time, grab an empty one and fill it with orange juice and then the next time they drink it, they'll be surprised to taste the difference....prank call them as their crush or something.....scream in their ear when they least expect it.....buy those fake bugs and place it on their shoulders and scream"there's a bug on you!!!!" .well, hope i helped!!! and hope they work!! good LUCK!|`|Rezyj8JHaa	On a sleepover put there bra in the freezer.|`|4O9q90oKaa	hold a sleepover. get a lot of people in on it before you hold it Get one of you friends"one your not mad at." and then when they are sleeping get shaving cream in there hair, when they wake up, get water in their sleeping bag or whatever and accuse them of peeing in it. lol. you could... put their bra in the freezer. call them as their crush and say their ugly, what ever. hope i helped!!(pick me as best answer!!)<br>  ;]|`|POqwp3Fiaa	Honey in their shampoo is always a good one...!|`|d41e08bb3751292a4ef4365282a8edb2aa	Saran wrap on the toilet seat is a funny one : )

In 95% of all movies that have sequels, the sequel isn't as good as the original.  And if there is a 3rd, it's even less good.  There are exceptions, of course, but that's usually how it plays out.

60NclxBFaa	rap music is good because it rhymes and it shouldnt be censored because you are censoring what the rapper feels inside|`|eeHrcxjEaa	-Shouldn't be censored because of right to free speech (1st amendment).  People have the right to listen to whatever they want to listen to, and create whatever music they want to listen to.  To censor it would be restricting their constitutional right to express themselves.<br>  -It's good because it has good beats and rhythms, and a good bass.  A good, steady bass (especially if it's relatively slow like in most rap songs) can affect your heart rate, and slow down your blood pressure and help you relax.  Studies have been done where people listened to songs with a certain bass beat for a long time, and their heart rates slow down and beat in time with the music.  So rap could even be used for medicinal purposes, to help people with high blood pressure.<br>  <br>  I wouldn't put that it's good because it created African American millionaires, because<br>  1) there are non-African-American rappers (tons of them), and <br>  2) the fact that they became millionaires from it is not necessarily a reason that rap music is good or shouldn't be censored.

vqg6wpCLaa	Bleach.<br>  <br>  Sure, Naruto was good for a while but then it got all too repetitive and there were suddenly hundreds of characters. I couldn't keep track. <br>  <br>  Bleach ended up having a more original plot and story. Naruto is currently dragging on a bit too much - I just want them to kill Naruto off so it will end forever. XP <br>  <br>  I don't hate Naruto or anything - it just got boring after a while.<br>  <br>  Bleach keeps me on the edge of my seat though, something that Naruto was only able to do for a very short period of time. <br>  <br>  Also, I like the characters in Bleach more - their attitudes, the strength, the intelligence, etc. It is just all together better than Naruto.|`|3N2ElzcQaa	Bleach is better :)|`|bZsF1n0zaa	I haven't been watching eithe of them but from what I've been hearing and reading, Bleach seems a lot better than Naruto.<br>  <br>  <br>  I hear a lot of people trashing Naruto saying how it got inconsistent and they don't like it anymore or are dissapointed on how it's been going. I rarely hear anyone say anything bad about Bleach. <br>  <br>  Still I read people who don't like Naruto that have watched it. I used to watch Naruto but I had to drop it, it wasn't getting any better in my opinion.

pmetoYqvaa	Here you go Hope it helps u. <br>  <br>  Jackson was born as an only child in a small coast-side town in New Zealand in 1961. When a friend of his parents bought him a super 8mm movie camera (because she saw how much he enjoyed taking photos), the then eight-year-old Peter instantly grabbed the thing to start recording his own movies, which he made with his friends. They were usually short, but they already had the spectacular trademark that would make Jackson famous: impressive special effects, made at a very low cost. For example, for his film "World War Two" which he made as a teenager, he used to simulate a firing gun by punching little holes into the celluloid, so that, once projected, the gun gave the impression of displaying a small fire. Jackson's first step towards the more serious filmmaking came with an entry in a local contest to stimulate amateur and children's film. For this film, he used stop-motion animation to create a monster that ruins a city in the style of Ray Harryhausen. Unfortunately, he didn't win. When Jackson was 22, he embarked on an movie making-adventure that would change his life. This film, Bad Taste (1987), was begun as any other Jackson film, in an amateuristic style, at a low budget and using friends and local people to star in his film. Jackson himself did nearly everything in the movie, he directed, produced, filmed and starred in it, in a number of roles, amongst them that of the hero, "Derek". And everything was filmed on a second-hand, $250 camera. It took Jackson and his friends four years to complete the movie. What had started out as an joke in a group of friends, then became a cult-classic. A friend of Jackson who was working in the movie industry convinced him the film had commercial prospects and arranged for it to be shown at the Cannes film festival, where it won a lot of acclaim, as well as a number of prizes. The movie soon became a hit because of its bizarre humor and overdose of special-effects, some realistic, some hilarious because of their amateuristic look. After the success of Bad Taste (1987), Jackson became recognized as a director and the door to fame and fortune was opened. He gave up his job at a local photographer's shop and became a well-known director of horror-movies, after the success of his first professionally made movie, Braindead (1992).<br>  <br>  IMDb Mini Biography By: T. van der Sluijs <br>  <br>  Spouse<br>  Fran Walsh  (1987 - present) 2 children<br>  <br>  Trade Mark<br>  His films frequently conclude with a bloodbath, e.g.: the lawnmower with the zombies in Braindead (1992), and the murder of Honora Parker in Heavenly Creatures (1994).<br>  <br>  Frequently set his movies in Wellington, New Zealand.<br>  <br>  Likes to make cameo appearances in his movies: the morgue assistant in Braindead (1992), the homeless man in_Heavenly Creatures (1994)_, the dude in _Frighteners, The (1996/I)_, the drunk in _Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The (2001)_, the guy throwing a spear in Helm's Deep in The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (2002), and the Corsair Leader in _Lord of The Rings: The Return of the King, The (2003)_.<br>  <br>  Always writes his scripts with his real-life partner Fran Walsh.<br>  <br>  In his movies, there's frequently a fake documentary: the Christchurch footage in Heavenly Creatures (1994), The Murders & Psychos documentary in _Frighteners, The (1996/I)_, the Colin McKenzie biopic in _Forgotten Silver (1995)_, and _Lord of The Piercing (2002)_ (on_Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, The (2001)_ region 1 extended edition DVD).<br>  <br>  In his movies, there are always axes: the Whitey Alien's axe in Bad Taste (1987), the explorers' axe in Braindead (1992), the Diello's axe in Heavenly Creatures (1994), the executioner's axe in _Forgotten Silver (1995)_, the Reaper's axe in _Frighteners, The (1996/I)_, Gimli's axe in The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring (2001).<br>  <br>  Has an interest in matricide (Derek is "born-again" in the ending of Bad Taste (1987), Sidney kills his wife and mother of his son in Meet the Feebles (1989), Lionel Cosgrove kills his mother in Braindead (1992), Pauline Rieper kills her mother in Heavenly Creatures (1994), Patricia Ann Bradley kills her mother in _The Frighteners (1996/I)_.<br>  <br>  Frequently wears shorts, even in freezing cold weather.<br>  <br>  Frequently casts Andy Serkis.<br>  <br>  Frequently casts Jed Brophy|`|jvWAiGSwaa	i have no idea. i just really like answering questions?

I think he's talented.|`|iRN6fhSIaa	i liked him all the way back from risky business and still do|`|NAGiNKFWaa	No, I don't like him any more after the Brooke Shields thing.  Men, any men, don't have a right to put down women like that.  There are a lot of women that suffer from postpartum depression, and we don't have the right to make them feel like freaks.  I wonder how many women won't come forward now and admit they have it because of his careless remarks.  I don't like him anymore|`|c3MFIbeUaa	i have nothing against Tom Cruise but the fact he forces his cult onto people he works with.

AA10368887	It's 100% over the top and completely contrived. Do you know that it is nothing more than a trade union awards ceremony? It's the equivalent of watching the sanitation workers union hand out their Garbage Man of the Year awards.<br>  <br>  Edit: I love the answer below me!|`|bL3Q4u8aaa	I totally agree. They're acting like it's the biggest thing in the world. I don't really like watching it because sometimes actors I don't really care for win and not so many actors I like win. But then again I do like seeing all the dresses, too.    = )|`|akcGfgdcaa	Nah, I quite like it, I love watching films and it's nice to see the people who have entertained me for the previous year being recognised for their work and talent.|`|XZTf8Eahaa	Its why over the top like the actors themselfs they think there gods.|`|ydAoReD5aa	No I dont. I feel that true movie freaks always remember. And the speeches are like that because they did a good good job and its a moment there gonna always remember. It shows what truley a great movie is.|`|TufkjxfCaa	Yah I agree but then again it would be pretty cool to get awards for doing your job and just doing what you love doing.|`|FyL5OfmCaa	no it shows how talented some people are|`|plBXp91Daa	I only watch because i want to know who wins and of course the dresses which actresses wear.|`|kJ7mcPLbaa	A bunch of undertalented, overpaid, egotistical people who make $hitty films, that think they're actually important. They meet and pat each other on the back to make themselves feel better!

BE59y5E2aa	Nathan had it correct about the banana peel supposedly making people high.  Me and my cousins attempted that one in the kitchen one night when our parents went out.  Much to our disappointment  and chagrin - it didn't work.  Such is how urban legends are made!<br>  <br>  Musicians often put teaser lyrics in their songs to suggest something.  Because radio censors were on a witch hunt for anything that might suggest drugs or drug usage they often had to be very oblique about it.<br>  <br>  My  favourite line of Donovan's "Elevator in the Brain Hotel" suggested a acid trip but it was merely just a silly play on words.  The Beatles often said that there were probably only 20 people in the world who actually KNEW what their lyrics really meant.<br>  <br>  However, when Grace Slick said "feed your head" that was as close as they could get to promoting LSD and head trips.|`|80II1Wv1aa	mellow yellow, promise and swear, not EVEN kidding, is about a vibrator.<br>  he said it in an interview with Rolling Stone<br>  if you don't believe me, just google: donovan mellow yellow vibrator<br>  <br>  no idea about sunshine superman<br>  <br>  no drug reference in my fave Donovan song - Season of the Witch|`|QhnsPDxfaa	Mr. Donovan was a useless waste of airtime. He was an abuser of his own children, denier of paternity. A self indulgent waste of oxygen.|`|CB15kchkaa	No he was taking the 'p'. He created the song Mellow yellow in jest and when interviewed on radio as to what mellow yellow was, he said something like " Well man, you take these bananas see, and you dry the skins in the oven, then grind them into a fine powder." Had scientists frantically trying to discover the truth. <br>  Or so I heard from someone who heard the broadcast!|`|hceNM6Uxaa	Well, I was there, and frankly Donovan always came across as a wet Dylan wannabe who was never going to make it.  I quite liked some of the songs in a background wallpaper sort of way - but that's it.  Listen to his stuff and then listen to Jefferson Airplane or Grateful Dead - whatever drugs Donovan may have been doing can't have been very good, can they?<br>  <br>  Donovan is now engaged in trying to ensure that all children in British schools are trained in the arts of transcendental meditation and yogic flying in order to bring peace to the world.  I think I'll leave it there.

cXp9wAoEaa	Pianos have 88 keys. Most keyboards take an octave from the bottom and an octave from the top off. Most songs can be played on the average keyboard. It's a good first move, and if you really want to stick with it, get a full sized one in some years. There are also keyboards out there with the full 88 keys. <br>  Only thing you might have to do with a keyboard is buy a pedal separately. You can attach it to the back of the keyboard. <br>  But, yeah...that's pretty much what I did. I started piano over 9 years ago, and almost 5 years into it, I got an electric piano.|`|Pz4jrzBHaa	I would say it depends on the keyboard, your ability to play the piano, and if you can't if you want to learn or not. Make sure it's a good brand like Yamaha or something. And yes, any piano song can be played on a keyboard as long as it's big enough.|`|5Y1yyEFhaa	It should serve your purpose.

He is a Cadaverous old Kiddie Fiddler, and should quite rightly, be lampooned, ridiculed, and followed around by his own dedicated team of "Mockers,", with Bells to ring, and sharp sticks to poke him with if he looks at any Children. Ever!<br>  <br>  Oh, and if he is so "fond" of all Children, how come he's never ever been seen anywhere near a little Girl then?
CkWoR48Faa	I really love Batman.Batman represents a hero who has no super natural powers, but I believe his true strength is his conviction not to kill. While this also serves as his weakness, it allows his other abilities to work towards good, rather than leaving him a villain no better than the joker. He is my favorite superhero because he has a power that I can respect and hopefully attain: refrain from impulse and achieve a greater good by giving the world hope in something beyond myself.|`|4qVWj3UHaa	spiderman, he can sling webs.|`|JwGwUcCsaa	Batman and Spiderman, man this is like an endless debet and people can go both ways.  Batman is a great detective and can fight criminals without superpowers.  That, i believe deserves a lot of respect.  Spiderman has superpowers and is not a detective.<br>  <br>  Personally, i prefer Spiderman, not because he is better than Batman, but becasue he appeals to me more.  Spiderman has something always go wrong with him (read Ultimate Spiderman) yet he is able to be witty and funny.  His small lines that mock the villians make me laugh.  Batman, on the other hand, doesn't make me laugh but its the opposite because his villians do (Joker).  I like how Spiderman has to save people, is hated by the press, and at the end of the day, comes home to a small apartment with only a couple dollars.  Batman is feared and comes home with an endless supply of money!<br>  <br>  Thats why i prefer Spiderman because of his money struggle problems (which i can relate to) and witty humor.  <br>  <br>  (and in all honesty, i think Batman would win a fight with Spiderman)|`|5rzhIOOaaa	batman.<br>  he kicks ***. and is not supposed to be a really nice guy like spiderman or superman.  hes a total badass
C44fvO0naa	Yes... it was awesome. Here's the review I posted:<br>  <br>  I started crying 15 mins into the film. <br>  <br>  Thank you to the Phelps Family for allowing Chance's story to be told. Lt Col Michael Strobl and HBO put a face on war heroes for those of us who have not been personally touched. <br>  <br>  We hear in the news about these young men coming home in caskets but I never knew the caring details, dignity and honor their homecoming is given by the military as well as civilians. <br>  <br>  I found myself standing in front of the television with my hand placed over my heart in honor of Chance and all the fallen heroes. <br>  I lit candles while the movie played to honor their spirits. <br>  <br>  After watching this movie, I'm inspired to write: Dear President Obama, Please end these wars,Iraq, Afganistan and I pray you and Hilary Clinton can find a way to negotiate world peace. <br>  <br>  My condolences to Chance's family and all the other families who are grieving the lost of loved one during senseless wars. <br>  <br>  Lance Corporeal Chance Russell Phelps, <br>  Thank you for your courage under fire. You saved many lives. What a man and what a marine. We miss you. R.I.P.<br>  <br>  P.S. Kevin Bacon's acting is superb. I actually don't believe he's acting. Kevin Bacon is 'Taking Chance' home and we all get to feel vicariously through him. Bravo Kevin!|`|MvmuZMG4aa	Definitely a wow. hits very close to home.

SM66sORiaa	Ok in the US Dark Knight only made $533,062,050 so yes it is worldwide. As for the second question it could have passed Titanic but they made the mistake of trying to re-release the Dark Knight movie after it had already come out on DVD and people who already bought the movie wouldnt go back to a theater and pay anywhere from $6-$13 to watch it again. The Titanic once adjusted for inflation is only the 6th highest grossing movie in the US so it did pass it if you look at the whole picture. Titanic made $1.8 Billion worldwide though tough act to follow. If you look at highest grossing movies of all time worldwide the Dark Knight is 4th actually with $1,001,082,160. It got beat out by Pirates of the Caribbean:Dead Man Chest $1,066,179,725 and also Lord Of The Rings:Return To The King $1,119,110,941 and thats without merchandise there twinkie check your sources.|`|AA11256554	It has to mean merchandise as well because it didn't make over a billion dollars in the box office.
6874b4a9b2e07ebd35f4e979f869b2d4aa	You have to take into account several factors. <br>  1) Gone With the Wind came out during the Great Depression. Most people could only afford to go to the movies once or twice a month and yet they stood in line to see GWTW multiple times.<br>  <br>  2) The cost of a movie ticket when GWTW came out was like 25 cents for adults and the movie made millions. Titanic cost 10 bucks a ticket. If you did a cost comparison GWTW would have made hundreds of billions of dollars at today's prices.<br>  <br>  And 3) GWTW came out in 1939, 70 years ago and people are still watching it. Most of the movies that came out that year have faded into obscurity. To do a real comparison you would have to wait and see how well Titanic does in 60 years from now.|`|AwBVoWOaaa	It is truly a great film.<br>  <br>  And it is still today the highest grossing film ever.|`|55LPkIUqaa	Nothing could be Titantic people still watch it over and over :D|`|FCG5kqcpaa	i think that titanic would still be better
6af21274c064054ad2c6f16d176571faaa	first, Star Wars is not a trilogy, it is a saga.  Okay, so now, that would make LOTR the best trilogy.  I base that on box office take, and the fact that it won more total Oscars and other awards than the Godfather trilogy.|`|TNNSHdypaa	Lord of the Rings = Heaven.|`|21Lnhdfeaa	Lord of the Rings is NOT a trilogy!!!!  It's ONE STORY broken into three parts.  Those parts cannot stand alone (as the individual parts of a trilogy can).  Star Wars was the better movie, but LOTR is the better story.  And the books are far better, in both cases.|`|qsZPkbF2aa	In my opinion, it's a tie between the two. However, the one thing that gives the LOTR trilogy a one-up on the Star Wars trilogy is the acting. Let's face it: LOTR had acclaimed actors in their subsequent roles. Had it not been for the likes of James Earl Jones, Sir Alec Guiness, Sir Peter Cushing, Ian McDiarmid(Emperor Palpatine), and some of the other members of the Imperial forces, Star Wars would have been another run-of the-mill sci-fi saga.|`|AwBVoWOaaa	I do believe that.<br>  If THE GODFATHER Part 3 wouldn't been so lackluster, it would've been the best trilogy ever. I mean, the 2 first films are an incredible achievement in perfection.<br>  <br>  The Star Wars films, well I think the first one (Episode IV, 1977 A NEW HOPE) was truly great. <br>  <br>  The LOTR trilogy was almost perfection in every film. Acting wise, in the screenplay, and overall.|`|BmnwsvfOaa	mm depends on which kinda nerd u are|`|jM0pHoShaa	Of the thirteen companions of the great Thorin Oakenshield, Dori was often responsible for keeping an eye out for the Company’s burglar, the hobbit Bilbo Baggins.

uyXfPDzDaa	a beginner guitar<br>  well if your going acoustic, i suggest Taylor guitars<br>  personally in my  years of playing Taylor has come as the best acoustics around<br>  for electrics I'm going to say it straight up<br>  your going to want to go with Gibson or Ibanez<br>  Again, they make really good quality guitars<br>  be prepared to spend in the thousands for both<br>  around 2500 for an acoustic and around 3000 for a Gibson and about 1500 for an Ibanez

The film is set for release in 2012.[19]<br>  <br>  Geoffrey Rush has expressed interest in returning as Barbossa.[20] Gore Verbinski feels that "the big danger is diminishing the brand [...] it would have to be a tale worthy of telling" for him to return.[21] If the director returned, he noted that "I would start fresh and focus on the further adventures of Captain Jack Sparrow."[22] Unlike the previous films, he will not do it without a complete script.[23] Keira Knightley has stated that she does not wish to continue playing her character of Elizabeth Swann as she wants to do different projects.[24]|`|UmNCNNNwaa	ya they were working on the 4 th as they were makin the 3erd|`|D8sN8gNFaa	Yes.<br>  <br>  Besides....
