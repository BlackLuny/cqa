20070318104007AAOSjil	Computers & Internet;Internet	Tagged.com emails.?	Okay, so lately I've been signing in on MSN, and I've been having e-mails in my inbox. No problem, except all it's been lately are these stupid Tagged.com emails e.g I go onto my inbox then there's an email from one of my contacts with the subject line 'Contact has Tagged you! :)'      I'm getting sick of recieving them, and when I get emails I usually think it may be from YouTube or MySpace but now all my emails are from this stupid Tagged thing. How do I stop getting these emails, since they're from my friends on my Contact List and not Tagged itself, so I can't mark every single contact of mine as Junk mail.      I won't join Tagged because i don't want to, I just like to have MySpace.

I know theres already a question like this but I have followed most of the responses, as in going to, in my case, Gateway's support website and downloading updates there. I did so but they did not have any Driver updates available for my type of computer. I just bought this Gateway last week. Should I return the computer for another one? My warranty is for another year.       Additional Details      9 minutes ago   So sorry, Ok, While I was playing Simcity 4, and I zoomed in, my screen went black for about 2 or 3 seconds, and the screen looked as though my video card had been messed with. Nothing was what it was before. There was different coloured polygons and it just doesn't look right. It's only when I zoom in that the problem occurs. When I exit the game. A pop up comes up, and says Driver has stopped and has fully recovered. It says under it my igfx driver has fully recovered.

I tried negoiating a refund, but the seller was rude and offensive, so i took it to the paypal resolutin centre.   The seller refused to contact and is still holding my money, so i escalated it to a claim.      I know that i can win the case because i have evidence, but the prob is that im going oversees in a while and internet access is zero at my destination, i wont be able to provide day2day communication for my case, which means that the seller auto wins the case.         What happens if a buyer loses a case?   are there fees involved?   is there anything i can do to make the case end before 3 weeks?   are there any suggestions anyone can give?   thank you.

Ieri un amico mi ha guardato un pò il computer, e tra le connessioni di rete mi ha trovato una connessione di nome "Connessione 1394 Net Adapter", sempre in stato "connesso", anche quando il computer non è collegato ad alcun modem, ad una velocità di 400 Mbps.   Se clicco su "disabilita" mi appare questo messaggio: "attualmente è impossibile disabilitare la connessione, in quanto potrebbe utilizzare uno o più protocolli che non supportano il plug and play o essere stata iniziata da un altro utente o dall'acount del sistema".   Voi cosa dite? E' una cosa normale o un virus? Perchè Avast non mi rileva alcun virus...

I have a website beeblefitness.com that works fine in firefox but in ie page  http://beeblefitness.com/2/library/cardi...  and some others show the ie 404 page rather than the pages it should. I use php and a custom 404 to load all my pages. It has worked in the past but since an update to PHP 4.4.9 by my hosting company it just doesn't work. If I turn off ie friendly 404 pages in the tools section it works fine, but I can't tell all my readers to do that. Before anyone mentions that the pages have to be over 512 bytes or the ie error page will load all my pages are larger than this.   I am at an absolute loss and cannot find anyone who knows an answer. Any advice will stop my nervous breakdown :)      Thank you in advance

That is what I am doing at the moment and it seems to work just fine so I was wondering what would be the advantage of a home server vs a regular OS and would linux or windows based be better? It will be for a very simple home server and it will be running on a netbook. There will be one desktop and one laptop connecting to it and occasionally a second desktop. The desktop that will be connecting to it very frequently runs vista and ubuntu dual-booted so what type of communication problems would there be between linux and windows?

20080704134548AAXP9CT	Computers & Internet;Software	Which is the best linux disrtobution for me?	I just got a laptop and it's a compaq Presario F700, and it runs Vista, so far I'm not too fond of Vista, the only thing I like on it is microsoft word 2007, but I only have a trial use so thats not going to last long. I am comsidering downloading a distobution fo linux on to my new laptop to replace Vista. I usually use my laptop for downloading music, talking to people on aim, web design, word prosessing and school projects. I did some research on linux distrobutions and I was considering Ubuntu but I heard that it doesn't support I-tunes and I kinda need that for my I-pod. I like to think that I am pretty good with computers and can do most things on them so it doesn't necessarily have to be the easyest distrobution to use, I just want one that will forfill my needs, I would also like it to be one of the free distrobutions and would prefer one that would have a live disk so I can test it out before I start using it.

20090227025446AAZEvca	Computers & Internet;Software	Looking for a old shareware CD collection?	Hey all, I am looking for a CD that was basically a collection of a bunch of shareware. I have been looking for this thing forever and I simply can't find it. It was lost some years ago and I miss it alot. :(      Anyway, here is what I know about it and how to help you find a copy, or the individual games floating around online.      1. I was born in 1986 (to help narrow the search)      2. I believe this shareware CD came into my life around 1990 near the end of the DOS era. I can't remember if it was before or after the time of windows 98. At that time we were loading windows via DOS command.      3. Some of the games that were on this CD: Doom, Crazy machine (it was sorta like a physics simulator or something), crystal caves, a submarine game where you are a carrier and drop explosive cans to blow up subs, Raptor (a top down shooter in a jet), Centipede, an asteroids clone named "roids" where you flew what appeared to be a red blimp, when you died some guy screamed OWWW OWWWW!      4. The CD itself was black with the word shareware in silver on it. I can't remember what else was written on it, but at the bottom I think it also had CD-R scribed on it... I think. Please help!

I bought a Sony Vaio Laptop in Japan with a Japanese OS. I can read some of the characters and it was relatively cheap compared to the english counterpart so I chose the Japanese one, deciding I can change the OS later. But my friends told me I shouldn't manually change the OS of a Sony Vaio laptop because it has some sort of lock and that if I do, my laptop might be damaged beyond repair. How true is this? I'm beginning to have problems with the Japanese version especially in troubleshooting so I'm thinking of going through with the OS change anyway. But before that, can anyone verify my doubts on changing the OS of a Japanese Home Premium Version of Windows Vista in a Sony Vaio Laptop?

I am facing problems with my network card and sound card.   After checking everything (drivers n all) it seems that it's a hardware issue.      My wireless network works but the LAN does not recognizes the network its connected to (however system shows that its connected to some Unidentified network)      Sound does not work and even sometimes I do not see the devices listed on the device manager.      INTERESTING FACT is that both these things work sometimes automatically and then stop working after some time.      Anyone had a similar problem? or any solutions to this.      I heard HP recalled such notebooks in US but I could not find the link.   If you have some information, please let me know

Ok, I just bought a new mouse since my old one stopped working so I bought a Razer Copperhead mouse. It worked perfect for a few days but than all of a sudden it would turn off and wouldn't work. I figured it's a faulty mouse or faulty drivers so I restarted my computer but as it was shutting down it just froze. It said "Shutting Down" and than it froze. It never freezes when it shuts down so I'm confused as to why this would happen. Then I held down the power button to manually shut it down and when I tried to turn it back on I heard the fans inside spinning but nothing on the screen and the only way I can get it to work again is to unplug the power plug and plug it back in. It's only happened a few times but every time it happens it's the same.  One time my whole setup froze. System, keyboard and mouse all froze. Any clue as to why this is happening and what can I do about this?

I tried removing whatever he downloaded but it didn't  help. I then tried System Restore to a previous date.  That didn't seem to help either. I am thinking about getting SPYWARE DOCTOR but after getting the free trial and scanning my computer it says that I have to pay for it to delete the unwanted items. I don't mind however I am wary of this .    When I clicked for Purchasing the spyware doctor my computer (another anti-virus Helix stated that it contained script that contained virus) I'm not sure what that means.         Can anyone tell me that if this program works or if it's a waste of money? I would appreciate it.  Or Do you know of any program that might help w/ a virus that is already on your computer.  We have Mcafee but at the time the Trial had expired since then I paid for the Mcafee but it doesn't remove any virus already on my computer just prevents new ones. Please Help me. It's so frustrating because I work from home and use that computer and I can't get any work done.  I would really, really appreciate it.

20090305063149AALVv6p	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Desktops	Computer in trouble, need help?	I got my Dell XPS 630i in June of 2008 and it's functioned fine the whole time I've had it.      As of this last week, when I boot it, it gets stuck around halfway through the bios loading screen.      I decided I probably had a virus or something and completely wiped my copy of vista out, replacing it with Windows 7, keeping no files or items from Vista.      This didn't work, so I decided it might be a bios problem, so I updated my bios from version 1.0.5 to 1.0.12, but that didn't help either      So basically it is a new computer, but still has trouble booting.   The weird part about the boot:   After it freezes in boot, I can force shutdown and repower up quickly and it will load 100% of the time.      What is wrong?

20090305064356AAXEwpK	Computers & Internet;Programming & Design	Is there a Win32 API call to ascertain what drives user has on his PC?	Is there a Win32 API call to ascertain what drives user has on his PC?      I am a Visual Foxpro Programmer. I have understood lately that Windows API calls can be given using Visual Foxpro 9.0 Professional Edition.      Is there a Visual Foxpro programmer using VFP 9.0 Professional Edition in this forum or elsewhere on the net (whom u know) who has good knowledge of Visual Foxpro as well as Win32 API and who could help me?      I wish to know what is the small VFP program (function) I have to write in Visual Foxpro such that my program will understand what are the various drives that are present on the user's PC (without physically accessing those drives)      What I mean by physically accessing is ->  For example if I give command SET DEFA TO E:\ (believing that Foxpro will give an error to me 'Invalid Path" if this drive doesn't exists on my PC I found two problems here:      Problem # 1: My computer doesn't have A:\ drive (that is floppy). But when I gave SET DEFA TO A:\ nothing happened for a while and then Windows gave its own message "Drive Not Ready" with three command buttons "Cancel; Try Again; Continue" and then if I pressed Cancel in Windows Error Dialog I was shown by Foxpro Invalid Path. Which means Foxpro or Windows actually physically tried to access the drive.       What I want is internally some Windows command should tell me whether a particular drive is present on users PC. For example suppose there is a Windows call   isdrivexists("A:") where A: Drive letter is passed as parameter then that Windows call will return some value which will tell me whether A:\ exists on users PC or not. So physically that drive is not accessed (and so no error "Drive Not Ready" is generated and flashed in a window by Windows). But internally I get to know that A: doesn't exist.      Problem # 2: My computer has DVD RW drive. But when I gave SET DEFA D:\ (which is DVD RW) Foxpro gave me error "Invalid drive". So immediately I understood that SET DEFA TO >>drive letter>> is useless to ascertain what drives are present on user's computers. Because in this case athough D:\ existed on my PC Foxpro gave me "Invalid drive or path" error (just because it didn't find a DVD in that drive). Now, while I am checking which drives exists the user may not be having a DVD put into his DVD Writer and so foxpro will return "Invalid drive or path" (so this SET DEFA TO command is not good to detect whether a drive exists on a user's PC).      Basically, In my Foxpro program I wish to show Drive Letters of Valid drives that are present on user's PC. So if some user has C:\ and D:\ but doesn't have A:\ then only C:\ and D:\ will be shown in drop box list. Got It!      For that I need a Windows call to internally ascertain what drives are present on user's PC. And I wish to know how to use that call from within Foxpro. So only a person who knows both Foxpro as well as Windows programming can tell me how to go about it.      Thanks & Regards,      Anita Mallya.

20090305072108AAYR7aZ	Computers & Internet;Software	Best linux\unix distro for a old pc?	I have recently acquired a old pc  So I want to dump linux or unix on it I have experience with many versions of linux and unix (ubuntu , open suse,solaris,etc..)  I do stress this is quite a old pc not old old 386 style but 750mhz cpu , 256mb ram slow ram 222mhz , 80gb hard drive and its got a geforce 440 mx 64mb g card..      I am basically looking for a distro which is quite light weight but well maintained with the basics (a browser, basic word processor, media is not needed but would be nice to have a player). I tried xbuntu but found it to be quite slow and altho it worked was kinda tedious having to wait for the most basic of things such a notepad to open. I would like a distro less than 500mb preferably but not essential for which the minimum requirements for are a lot lower than this pc since yes many versions will run on this pc I want something that will run quite fast even when multiple applications are running (low spec applications) basically a linux or unix equivalently spec wise to ME. ooo and of course must be FREE lol

Now any time i start up its in the same "out of scan range" resolution.

I had a new motherboard put into my computer but didn't get the driver disk that came with it, so I'm a bit unsure which drivers I need to download and how to save them to disk. I went to the Biostar Europe website as that's the make of the motherboard and this is what I have so far... Biostar MCP6P M2+ motherboard, I've been told to download ethernet chipset, onboard vga, onboard audio, usb controller and serial raid. Is there anything else I need to download to get my computer working, and also how do I save it all to cd as the cd's I have don't seem to be working??? Which kind do I need and what size? I would be very grateful for any help you can give me. :)

20090305083823AAgeK2j	Computers & Internet;Hardware;Monitors	What can cause short sporadic losses of HD Cable TV Signal on my LCD Monitor (via HDMI>DVI cable)?	While viewing the HDMI output from my HD Cable TV Box on the DVI input to my LCD Monitor, the screen sporadically goes black for a second or two, and then briefly shows a pop-up message "Input Select DVI" when the signal returns (the same message which pops up whenever Monitor inputs are switched manually between PC and TV).        The Monitor does not black out while set to the PC input -- only while it's set to the DVI input -- and there aren't any blackouts on the RF output from the same Cable Box -- only the HDMI output.        I can't trigger the black screen by wiggling the HDMI>DVI Cable connections, either.        Any ideas?
